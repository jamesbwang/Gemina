 To analyze the correlation of ATO<ORGANIZATION> therapeutic dose with the relapse of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL<ORGANIZATION> ) and to investigate the optimal dose and courses of ATO<ORGANIZATION>. The clinical data of 102 patients with APL<ORGANIZATION> from January 2008 to June 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical characteristics of APL<ORGANIZATION> patients in relapsed group and maintained remission group were compared. According to ATO<ORGANIZATION> dose in 2 years recommended in chinese guideline as criteria of grouping, the patients were divided into ATO<ORGANIZATION> high and low dose groups, then the relapse rate in groups was compared. The cut-off value of ATO<ORGANIZATION> dose was analyzed by ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> analysis showed that the relapse rate in high ATO<ORGANIZATION> and low ATO<ORGANIZATION> groups on 2 year treatment was 2.5 % and 17.7 % respectively ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) ; multiple variate analysis demonstrated that the ATO<ORGANIZATION> dose > 22.4 mg/kg on 2 year treatment was independent preventive factor for the relapse of APL<ORGANIZATION> ( OR=0.119, P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). The ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve showed that the cut-off value of ATO<ORGANIZATION> dose on 2 year treatment was 8.765 mg/kg. The relapse rate of APL<ORGANIZATION> in group of ATO<ORGANIZATION> dose > 8.765 mg/kg group was significantly lower than that in group of ATO<ORGANIZATION> dose < 8.765 mg/kg. The relapse of APL<ORGANIZATION> relates with used ATO<ORGANIZATION> dose, sufficient use of ATO<ORGANIZATION> dose can decrease the relapse rate of APL<ORGANIZATION>.
