 Chronic<GPE> rhinosinusitis ( CRS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a common disorder associated with other respiratory tract diseases such as asthma and inhalant allergy. However, the prevalence of these co-morbidities varies considerably in the existing medical literature and by phenotype of CRS<ORGANIZATION> studied. The study objective was to identify the prevalence of asthma, inhalant allergy and aspirin sensitivity in CRS<ORGANIZATION> patients referred to secondary care and establish any differences between CRS<ORGANIZATION> phenotypes. All participants were diagnosed in secondary care according to international guidelines and invited to complete a questionnaire including details of co-morbidities and allergies. Data were analysed for differences between controls and CRS<ORGANIZATION> participants and between phenotypes using chi-squared tests. The final analysis included 1470 study participants: 221 controls, 553 CRS without nasal polyps ( CRSsNPs<ORGANIZATION> ), 651 CRS with nasal polyps ( CRSwNPs<ORGANIZATION> ) and 45 allergic fungal rhinosinusitis ( AFRS<ORGANIZATION> ). The prevalence of asthma was 9.95, 21.16, 46.9 and 73.3 % respectively. The prevalence of self-reported confirmed inhalant allergy was 13.1, 20.3, 31.0 and 33.3 % respectively ; house dust mite allergy was significantly higher in CRSwNPs<GPE> ( 16 % ) compared to CRSsNPs<GPE> ( 9 %, p < 0.001 ). The prevalence of self- reported aspirin sensitivity was 2.26, 3.25, 9.61 and 40 % respectively. The odds ratio for aspirin sensitivity amongst those with AFRS<ORGANIZATION> was 28.8 ( CIs<ORGANIZATION> 9.9, 83.8 ) p < 0.001. The prevalence of asthma and allergy in CRS<ORGANIZATION> varies by phenoytype, with CRSwNPs<ORGANIZATION> and AFRS<ORGANIZATION> having a stronger association with both. Aspirin<PERSON> sensitivity has a highly significant association with AFRS<ORGANIZATION>. All of these comorbidities are significantly more prevalent than in non-CRS controls and strengthen the need for a more individualised approach to the combined airway.
