 Kashin-Beck disease ( KBD<ORGANIZATION> ) is an endemic, chronic, and degenerative osteoarthropathy. Selenium<GPE> ( Se ) deficiency plays important role in the pathogenesis of KBD<ORGANIZATION>. We aimed to screen Se-related gene from chondrocytes of patients with KBD<ORGANIZATION>. Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays were used to detect differentially expressed genes. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the microarray results. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database<ORGANIZATION> ( CTD<ORGANIZATION> ) was used to screen Se-related genes from differentially expressed genes. Gene Ontology<PERSON> ( GO ) classifications and network analysis of Se-related genes were constituted by STRING<ORGANIZATION> online system. Three hundred ninety-nine differentially expressed genes were obtained from microarray. Among them, 54 Se-related genes were identified by CTD<ORGANIZATION>. The qRT-PCR validation showed that four genes expressed similarly with the ones in the microarray transcriptional profiles. The Se-related genes were categorized into 6 cellular components, 8 molecular functions, 44 biological processes, 10 pathways, and 1 network by STRING<ORGANIZATION>. The Se-related gene insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 ( IGFBP2<ORGANIZATION> ), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 ( IGFBP3<ORGANIZATION> ), interleukin 6 ( IL6<ORGANIZATION> ), BCL2<ORGANIZATION>, apoptosis regulator ( BCL2<ORGANIZATION> ), and BCL2-associated X, apoptosis regulator ( BAX<ORGANIZATION> ), which involved in many molecular functions, biological processes, and apoptosis pathway may play important roles in the pathogenesis of KBD<ORGANIZATION>.
