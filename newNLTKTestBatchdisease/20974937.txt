 In recent years, an increasing number of Campylobacter<GPE> species have been associated with human gastrointestinal ( GI ) diseases including gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer. Campylobacter concisus, an oral commensal historically linked to gingivitis and periodontitis, has been increasingly detected in the lower GI tract. In the present study, we generated robust genome sequence data from C. concisus strains and undertook a comprehensive pangenome assessment to identify C. concisus virulence properties and to explain potential adaptations acquired while residing in specific ecological niche ( s ) of the GI<ORGANIZATION> tract. Genomes of 53 new C. concisus strains were sequenced, assembled, and annotated including 36 strains from gastroenteritis patients, 13 strains from Crohn<GPE> 's disease patients and four strains from colitis patients ( three collagenous colitis and one lymphocytic colitis ). When compared with previous published sequences, strains clustered into two main groups/genomospecies ( GS ) with phylogenetic clustering explained neither by disease phenotype nor sample location. Paired<PERSON> oral/faecal isolates, from the same patient, indicated that there are few genetic differences between oral and gut isolates which suggests that gut isolates most likely reflect oral strain relocation. Type IV<PERSON> and VI<ORGANIZATION> secretion systems genes, genes known to be important for pathogenicity in the Campylobacter genus, were present in the genomes assemblies, with 82 % containing Type VI<PERSON> secretion system genes. Our findings indicate that C. concisus strains are genetically diverse, and the variability in bacterial secretion system content may play an important role in their virulence potential.
