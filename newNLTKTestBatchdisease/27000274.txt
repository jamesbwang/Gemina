 As `` Immunotherapy age '' is coming, immune checkpoint inhibitors ( CPI<ORGANIZATION> ) therapies have shown favorable clinical benefits and low toxicity profiles in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ). While it is a pity that there is a little clear clinical trials evidence about immunotherapy among Asian<GPE> population. Moreover, since there is an ethnic difference for targeted therapy, what about immunotherapy ? Which factors may associate with ethnic differences from Caucasian<GPE> population to Asiatic<GPE> population ? In this review, we supposed that the characteristics of the much higher proportion of EGFR<ORGANIZATION> mutation, hepatitis B virus infection and unexpected immune-related toxicity among Asian<GPE> patients should be considered.
