 Apolipoprotein<PERSON> E ( ApoE<ORGANIZATION> ) is a secreted apolipoprotein with three isoforms, E2<GPE>, E3<GPE>, and E4<GPE>, that binds to lipids and facilitates their transport in the extracellular environment of the brain and the periphery. The E4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for the sporadic form of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ) and studies of human brain and mouse models have revealed that the E4 significantly exacerbates the deposition of amyloid-beta ( Aβ ). It has been suggested that this deposition could be attributed to the formation of soluble ApoE<ORGANIZATION> isoform-specific ApoE-Aβ complexes. However, previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the directionality and strength of those interactions. In this study, using a series of flow cytometry assays that maintain the physiological integrity of ApoE-Aβ complexes, we systematically assessed the association of Aβ with ApoE2<ORGANIZATION>, E3<GPE>, or E4. We used ApoE<ORGANIZATION> secreted from HEK<ORGANIZATION> cells or astrocytes overexpressing ApoE<ORGANIZATION> fused with a GFP<ORGANIZATION> tag. As a source of soluble Aβ peptide, we used synthetic Aβ40 or Aβ42 or physiological Aβ secreted from CHO<ORGANIZATION> cell lines overexpressing wildtype or V717F<PERSON> variant amyloid precursor protein ( APP<ORGANIZATION> ). We observed significant interactions between the different ApoE<ORGANIZATION> isoforms and Aβ<GPE>, with E4 interacting with Aβ more strongly than the E2 and E3 isoforms. We also found subtle differences depending on the Aβ type and the ApoE-producing cell type. In conclusion, these results indicate that the strength of the ApoE-Aβ association depends on the source of Aβ or ApoE<ORGANIZATION>.
