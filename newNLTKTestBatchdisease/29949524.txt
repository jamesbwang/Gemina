 BACKGROUND<ORGANIZATION> Pentraxin-3 ( PTX3<ORGANIZATION> ) is considered a high quality inflammatory marker of the severity and prognosis of several diseases, however, the value of PTX3<ORGANIZATION> in thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke remains unclear and PTX3<ORGANIZATION> is still controversial in evaluating the prognosis of stroke patients. In this study, we investigated the association of PTX3<ORGANIZATION> with thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. MATERIAL<ORGANIZATION> AND METHODS<ORGANIZATION> Forty-seven stroke patients who received thrombolytic therapy within 4.5 hours after symptom onset were enrolled consecutively between July 2016 and June 2017. All the patients underwent multiphase CTA<ORGANIZATION> ( computerized tomography angiography ) or CT perfusion before thrombolysis with no indication for endovascular treatment. Initial<PERSON> and 24 hours of National Institute<ORGANIZATION> of Health Stroke Scale<PERSON> ( NIHSS<ORGANIZATION> ) scores and serum PTX3<ORGANIZATION> level, stroke risk factors and predictors, and mRS<ORGANIZATION> ( modified Rankin<PERSON> scale ) at 3 months were collected prospectively. Predictors of thrombolytic therapy effect and long-term prognosis were investigated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS The 24 hour NIHSS<ORGANIZATION> score and the treatment time was associated with symptom improvement, while the PTX3<ORGANIZATION> level had no association with neurological improvement and prognosis in stroke patients receiving thrombolytic therapy. CONCLUSIONS<ORGANIZATION> PTX3 is not suitable to serve as an indicator of thrombolytic efficacy and had no association with long-term prognosis in stroke patients receiving thrombolytic therapy.
