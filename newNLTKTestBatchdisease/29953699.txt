 Motor<GPE> neuron disease ( MND<ORGANIZATION> ) refers to a spectrum of degenerative diseases affecting motor neurons. Recent clinical and postmortem observations have revealed considerable variability in the phenotype. Rhythmic<PERSON> involuntary oscillations of the hands during action, resembling tremor, can occur in MND<ORGANIZATION>, but its pathophysiology has not yet been investigated. 120 consecutive MND<ORGANIZATION> patients were screened for tremor. Twelve patients with action tremor and no other movement disorders were found. Ten took part in the study. Tremor<PERSON> was recorded bilaterally using surface electromyography and triaxial accelerometer, with and without a variable weight load. Power<PERSON> spectra of rectified electromyography and accelerometric signal were calculated. To investigate a possible cerebellar involvement, eye blink classic conditioning ( EBCC<ORGANIZATION> ) was performed in five patients. Action tremor was present in about 10 % of our population. All patients showed distal postural tremor of low amplitude and constant frequency, bilateral with a small degree of asymmetry. Two of them showed also simple kinetic tremor. A peak at the electromyography and accelerometric recordings ranging from 4 Hz to 12 Hz was found in all patients. Loading did not change peak frequency in either the electromyographic or accelerometric power spectra. Compared with healthy volunteers, patients had a smaller number of conditioned responses during EBCC<ORGANIZATION>. our data suggest that MND<ORGANIZATION> patients can present with action tremor of a central origin, possibly due to a cerebellar dysfunction. This evidence supports the novel idea of MND<ORGANIZATION> as a multisystem neurodegenerative disease and that action tremor can be part of this condition. This article is protected by copyright.
