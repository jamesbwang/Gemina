 Salicylic<GPE> acid ( SA ) signaling plays an essential role in plant innate immunity. In this study, we identified a component in the SA signaling pathway in potato ( Solanum<ORGANIZATION> tuberosum ), the transcription factor StbZIP61<ORGANIZATION>, and characterized its function in defence against Phytophthora<ORGANIZATION> infestans. Expression of StbZIP61<ORGANIZATION> was induced upon P. infestans infection and following exposure to the defense signaling hormones SA, ethylene and jasmonic acid. Overexpression of StbZIP61<ORGANIZATION> increased the tolerance of potato plants to P. infestans while RNA<ORGANIZATION> interference ( RNAi<ORGANIZATION> ) increased susceptibility. Yeast two-hybrid and pull down experiments revealed that StbZIP61<ORGANIZATION> could interact with an NPR3-like protein ( StNPR3L<ORGANIZATION> ) that inhibited its DNA-binding and transcriptional activation activities. Moreover, StNPR3L<ORGANIZATION> interacted with StbZIP61<ORGANIZATION> in an SA-dependent manner. Among candidate genes involved in SA-regulated defense responses, StbZIP61<ORGANIZATION> had a significant impact on expression of StICS1<ORGANIZATION>, which encodes a key enzyme for SA<ORGANIZATION> biosynthesis. StICS1 transcription was induced upon P. infestans infection and this responsive expression to the pathogen was reduced in StbZIP61<ORGANIZATION> RNAi plants. Accordingly, StICS1<ORGANIZATION> expression was remarkably enhanced in StbZIP61-overexpressing plants. Together, our data demonstrate that StbZIP61<ORGANIZATION> functions in concert with StNPR3L<ORGANIZATION> to regulate the temporal activation of SA<ORGANIZATION> biosynthesis, which contributes to SA-mediated immunity against P. infestans infection in potato.
