 Chronic<GPE> delta hepatitis, caused by hepatitis delta virus ( HDV<ORGANIZATION> ), is the most severe form of viral hepatitis, affecting at least 20 million hepatitis B virus ( HBV<ORGANIZATION> ) -infected patients worldwide. HDV/HBV co- or superinfections are major drivers for hepatocarcinogenesis. Antiviral treatments exist only for HBV<ORGANIZATION> and can only suppress but not cure infection. Development of more effective therapies has been impeded by the scarcity of suitable small-animal models. We created a transgenic ( tg ) mouse model for HDV<ORGANIZATION> expressing the functional receptor for HBV<ORGANIZATION> and HDV<ORGANIZATION>, the human sodium taurocholate cotransporting peptide NTCP<ORGANIZATION>. Both HBV<ORGANIZATION> and HDV<ORGANIZATION> entered hepatocytes in these mice in a glycoprotein-dependent manner, but one or more postentry blocks prevented HBV<ORGANIZATION> replication. In contrast, HDV<ORGANIZATION> persistently infected hNTCP<ORGANIZATION> tg mice coexpressing the HBV<ORGANIZATION> envelope, consistent with HDV<ORGANIZATION> dependency on the HBV<ORGANIZATION> surface antigen ( HBsAg<ORGANIZATION> ) for packaging and spread. In immunocompromised mice lacking functional B, T<GPE>, and natural killer cells, viremia lasted at least 80 days but resolved within 14 days in immunocompetent animals, demonstrating that lymphocytes are critical for controlling HDV<ORGANIZATION> infection. Although acute HDV<ORGANIZATION> infection did not cause overt liver damage in this model, cell-intrinsic and cellular innate immune responses were induced. We further demonstrated that single and dual treatment with myrcludex B and lonafarnib efficiently suppressed viremia but failed to cure HDV<ORGANIZATION> infection at the doses tested. This small-animal model with inheritable susceptibility to HDV<ORGANIZATION> opens opportunities for studying viral pathogenesis and immune responses and for testing novel HDV<ORGANIZATION> therapeutics.
