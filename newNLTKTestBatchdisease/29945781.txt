 The number of patients undergoing preoperative risk stratification in the United States<GPE> is expected to increase as the population ages. A large percentage of patients undergo some form of preoperative testing, and society guidelines suggest that up to 50 % of the testing in lower risk surgical subgroups is unnecessary. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index<ORGANIZATION> and the risk calculator of the American College<ORGANIZATION> of Surgeons National Surgical Quality<ORGANIZATION> Improvement Program are widely used tools as the first step of preoperative cardiac evaluation. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index<ORGANIZATION> was developed to fill a need for objective perioperative cardiac risk evaluation. Despite the ease of use of Revised Cardiac Risk Index<ORGANIZATION>, it is uncertain if the stratification is accurate for surgical patients because its accuracy in large surgical samples has not been tested. With the National Surgical Quality<ORGANIZATION> Improvement Program risk calculator having excellent accuracy in estimating cardiac complications ( area under the receiver operating characteristic 0.895 ), a unique opportunity to test the predictive accuracy of postsurgical cardiac events became available. The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index<PERSON> for predicting cardiovascular complications after adhesiolysis for small bowel obstruction. From 2005 to 2015, 34,032 cases of open or laparoscopic adhesiolysis ( Current Procedural Terminology<ORGANIZATION> codes 44005 and 44180 ) for small bowel obstruction ( International Classification<ORGANIZATION> of Diseases<GPE>, 10th edition [ ICD-10 ] ) were analyzed using the National Surgical Quality<ORGANIZATION> Improvement Program dataset. Revised Cardiac Risk Index<PERSON> estimates were calculated for each case and compared to reported cardiovascular complications ( myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest ) using univariable logistic regression. Overall predictive accuracy was assessed by measuring model discrimination ( area under the receiver operating characteristic ) and model calibration ( Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-squared statistics ). Although the Revised Cardiac Risk Index<PERSON> predicted cardiovascular complications with an odds ratio of 2.3 and a 95 % confidence interval of 1.9 to 2.8 ( P<PERSON> < .001 ) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square was significant ( 0.22, P<PERSON> = 0.64 ), the area under the receiver operating characteristic was poor ( 0.63, 95 % confidence interval 0.59-0.67 ). Despite its relative simplicity, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index<PERSON> performed poorly as a predictor of cardiovascular complications after adhesiolysis for small bowel obstruction. These findings question the utility of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index<PERSON> in this patient population. Future studies should aim to develop models that are computationally simple while retaining predictive accuracy.
