 The high prevalence ( 14.3 % ) of HIV/HBV co-infections reported in west China<GPE> makes it necessary to screen concurrent HBV<ORGANIZATION> infection in HIV carriers. HBV<ORGANIZATION> B genotype was shown to be dominant in 54 cases of HIV/HBV co-infection, accounting for 81.48 % of the total. The total drug resistance rate observed was 3.70 %. A1762T<PERSON>, G1764A<PERSON> and G1896A<GPE> mutations were common mutations identified in the BCP/PC region. However, the prevalence of the G1896A<GPE> mutation was significantly high among the HBeAg<ORGANIZATION> negative HIV/HBV co-infected patients, and may be associated with high HBV<ORGANIZATION> replication. Mutations in the PC region are related to the loss in synthesis of HBeAg<ORGANIZATION> and may accelerate HBV<ORGANIZATION> replication in HIV positive patients.
