 A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) for the prophylaxis of chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ). Six studies involving 365 patients were included. The pooled results showed that MSCs<ORGANIZATION> significantly reduced the incidence of cGVHD<ORGANIZATION> ( risk ratio [ RR ] 0.63, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.46 to 0.86, P<PERSON> = 0.004 ). Favorable prophylactic effects of MSCs<ORGANIZATION> on cGVHD<ORGANIZATION> were observed with umbilical cord-derived, high-dose, and late-infusion MSCs<ORGANIZATION>, while bone marrow-derived, low-dose, and coinfused MSCs<ORGANIZATION> did not confer beneficial prophylactic effects. In addition, MSC<ORGANIZATION> infusion did not increase the risk of primary disease relapse and infection ( RR 1.02, 95 % CI 0.70 to 1.50, P<PERSON> = 0.913 ; RR 0.89, 95 % CI 0.44 to 1.81, P<PERSON> = 0.752 ; respectively ). Moreover, there was an apparent trend toward increased overall survival ( OS ) in the MSC<ORGANIZATION> group compared with that in the control group ( RR 1.13, 95 % CI 0.98 to 1.29, P<PERSON> = 0.084 ). In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrated that MSC<ORGANIZATION> infusion is an effective and safe prophylactic strategy for cGVHD<ORGANIZATION> in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allo-HSCT.
