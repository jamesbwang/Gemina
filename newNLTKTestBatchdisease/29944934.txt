 Trichophyton<GPE> rubrum is one of the most common dermatophytes, which can cause fungal nail and ringworm infections. Infections associated with T. rubrum have become a global phenomenon. Herein<PERSON>, we report the antifungal photodynamic inactivation of T. rubrum ( ATCC<ORGANIZATION> 28188 ) using the mesoporous silica-coated silver nanoparticle-based hybrid photosensitizers without involving antifungal drugs. Results show that the hybrid photosensitizers display low cytotoxicity under the experimental conditions where significant killing ( ~3 orders of magnitude ) against T. rubrum is observed. These results demonstrate the potential applications of the nanoparticle-based hybrid photosensitizers in antifungal photodynamic therapy against T. rubrum.
