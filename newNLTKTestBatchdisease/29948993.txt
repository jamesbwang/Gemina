 Liver<GPE> involvement in celiac disease ( CD ) is classified into autoimmune and cryptogenic. The association between CD<ORGANIZATION> and autoimmune liver diseases like autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis is well-established ; however, the data on patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, particularly from India<GPE>, are scanty. So we did this study to find the prevalence of CD in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis. This was a prospective observational study, involving children of less than 18 years old attending Pediatric<PERSON> and Gastroenterology<GPE> clinic with a diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis. The patients were evaluated for CD<ORGANIZATION> and divided into two groups: chronic liver disease ( CLD<ORGANIZATION> ) with CD<ORGANIZATION>, and CLD<ORGANIZATION> without CD. Both the groups were followed up for 6 months. CLD with CD<ORGANIZATION> group was treated with gluten-free-diet ( GFD<ORGANIZATION> ) and CLD<ORGANIZATION> without CD<ORGANIZATION> group was followed up without any specific intervention except standard care of CLD<ORGANIZATION>. Out of 84 patients, 11 ( 13.1 % ) were diagnosed as CLD<ORGANIZATION> with CD<ORGANIZATION>. There was an improvement in hemoglobin levels, liver function tests, and Child-Pugh score after initiation of GFD<ORGANIZATION> in CLD<ORGANIZATION> with CD<ORGANIZATION> group. The prevalence of CD in cryptogenic cirrhosis was 13.1 %. Screening for CD<ORGANIZATION> is recommended for cryptogenic cirrhosis. Hepatic functions improve with a GFD<ORGANIZATION> in CD patients with cirrhosis.
