 Silver<GPE> nanoparticles ( nanoAg<ORGANIZATION> ) are effective antimicrobials and promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics. This study aimed at evaluating potency of different nanoAg against healthcare infections associated bacteria: Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. A library of differently coated nanoAg<ORGANIZATION> of two different sizes ( 10 and 50 nm ) were prepared using coating agents poly-L-Lysine ( PLL<ORGANIZATION> ), cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide ( CTAB<ORGANIZATION> ), citrate ( CIT<ORGANIZATION> ), polyvinyl-pyrrolidone ( PVP<ORGANIZATION> ), polysorbate 80 ( Tween 80 ), and dioctyl-sodium sulfosuccinate ( AOT<ORGANIZATION> ). Stability evaluation by means of agglomeration and dissolution behaviour was performed for all nanoAg under conditions relevant for this study. Antibacterial properties of nanoAg<ORGANIZATION> were addressed by determining their minimal bactericidal concentrations ( MBC<ORGANIZATION> ) in deionised ( DI ) water to minimise the influence of silver speciation on its bioavailability. In parallel, AgNO<ORGANIZATION>
