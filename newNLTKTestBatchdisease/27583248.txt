 The treatment of autoimmune diseases still poses a major challenge, frequently relying on non-specific immunosuppressive drugs. Current efforts aim at reestablishing self tolerance using immune cells with suppressive activity like the regulatory T cells ( Treg<ORGANIZATION> ) or the myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSC<ORGANIZATION> ). We have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of MDSC<ORGANIZATION> in mouse Alopecia Areata<PERSON> ( AA ). In the same AA model, we now asked whether MDSC<ORGANIZATION> exosomes ( MDSC-Exo ) can replace MDSC<ORGANIZATION>. MDSC-Exo from bone marrow cells ( BMC<ORGANIZATION> ) cultures of healthy donors could substantially facilitate treatment. With knowledge on MDSC-Exo being limited, their suitability needs to be verified in advance. Protein<PERSON> marker profiles suggest comparability of BMC- to
