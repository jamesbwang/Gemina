 Obesity<GPE> is characterized by excessive accumulation of body fat, which causes damage to the health of individuals, such as breathing difficulties. To verify the results of non-invasive ventilation as a preventive strategy on the decline of respiratory function and postoperative complications in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This is a randomized trial, according to CONSORT<ORGANIZATION> standards, with obese adults aged 18-40 years. Randomized<PERSON> control group ( n=25 ) only received guidelines regarding posture, early ambulation and cough stimuli, and in the NIV<ORGANIZATION> group ( n=25 ), in addition to the aforementioned group, non-invasive ventilation was performed with two pressure levels, once day for 60 min, from the 1st to the 3rd postoperative day ( POD<ORGANIZATION> ). Both groups were evaluated in the preoperative period and in the 1st and 3rd POD for respiratory function, which were: slow vital capacity ( VC ), inspiratory capacity ( IC ), minute volume ( MV ), tidal volume maximal inspiratory muscle strength ( Pimax ) and peak expiratory flow ( PEF<ORGANIZATION> ). The length of hospital stay and the episodes of postoperative complications were recorded. Of the 50 patients the majority were young adults with degrees of obesity between III<ORGANIZATION> and IV<ORGANIZATION>. In the intergroup analysis, there was an improvement in the CVL<ORGANIZATION> and MV only in the 1st POD in the NIV<ORGANIZATION> group, CI in the three moments evaluated in the NIV<ORGANIZATION> group and the PFE<ORGANIZATION> in the 1st and 3rd PDO<ORGANIZATION> also in this group. The most frequent complications were pneumonia, followed by operative wound infection and atelectasis. There was a significant difference between groups, showing a higher occurrence in pneumonia and atelectasis in the control group. The days of hospitalization and intensive care unit were similar. It was observed a faster recovery until the 3rd POD in the IC<ORGANIZATION> and PEF<ORGANIZATION> variables in the NIV<ORGANIZATION> group ; in addition, there were fewer complications in this group.
