 Needle<GPE> procedures are among the most distressing aspects of pediatric cancer-related treatment. Virtual reality ( VR ) distraction offers promise for needle-related pain and distress given its highly immersive and interactive virtual environment. This study assessed the usability ( ease of use and understanding, acceptability ) of a custom VR intervention for children with cancer undergoing implantable venous access device ( IVAD<ORGANIZATION> ) needle insertion. Three iterative cycles of mixed-method usability testing with semistructured interviews were undertaken to refine the VR<ORGANIZATION>. Participants included 17 children and adolescents ( 8-18 years old ) with cancer who used the VR<ORGANIZATION> intervention prior to or during IVAD<ORGANIZATION> access. Most participants reported the VR as easy to use ( 82 % ) and understand ( 94 % ), and would like to use it during subsequent needle procedures ( 94 % ). Based on usability testing, refinements were made to VR hardware, software, and clinical implementation. Refinements focused on increasing responsiveness, interaction, and immersion of the VR<ORGANIZATION> program, reducing head movement for VR<ORGANIZATION> interaction, and enabling participant alerts to steps of the procedure by clinical staff. No adverse events of nausea or dizziness were reported. The VR<ORGANIZATION> intervention was deemed acceptable and safe. Next steps include assessing feasibility and effectiveness of the VR<ORGANIZATION> intervention for pain and distress.
