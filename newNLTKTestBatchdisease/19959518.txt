 Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ) is a common cause of cancer-related death, with incidence increasing worldwide. Unfortunately, the overall prognosis for patients with HCC<ORGANIZATION> is poor and many patients present with advanced stages of disease that preclude curative therapies. Diagnostic<PERSON> and interventional radiologists play a key role in the management of patients with HCC<ORGANIZATION>. Diagnostic<ORGANIZATION> radiologists can use contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CT ), magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound to diagnose and stage HCC<ORGANIZATION>, without the need for pathologic confirmation, by following established criteria. Once staged, the interventional radiologist can treat the appropriate patients with percutaneous ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, or radioembolization. Follow-up imaging after these liver-directed therapies for HCC<ORGANIZATION> can be characterized according to various radiologic response criteria ; although, enhancement-based criteria, such as European Association<ORGANIZATION> for the Study of the Liver and modified Response Evaluation Criteria<PERSON> in Solid Tumors<GPE>, are more reflective of treatment effect in HCC<ORGANIZATION>. Newer imaging technologies like volumetric analysis, dual-energy CT, cone beam CT and perfusion CT may provide additional benefits for patients with HCC<ORGANIZATION>.
