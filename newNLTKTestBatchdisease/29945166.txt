 In recent years, the increasing resistance of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC<ORGANIZATION> ) to commonly used antibiotics has made it difficult to choose the best treatment option. Bacteriophage therapy could be a potent alternative to antibiotic therapy for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The aim of the present study was to isolate and identify a specific bacteriophage against enteropathogenic E. coli ( EPEC<ORGANIZATION> ) and characterize bacteriophage in vitro and in vivo. The specific bacteriophage was isolated and the effect of phage therapy on 48 mice ( Balb/c ) was investigated. Animals were divided into six groups, including A: PBS ( negative control ), B: bacteria ( positive control ), C: bacteria + ciprofloxacin ( after 24 hours ), D<PERSON>: bacteria + bacteriophage ( after 24 hours ), E: bacteria + ciprofloxacin + bacteriophage ( after 24 hours ), and F: bacteriophage + bacteria ( after 24 hours ). Specific bacteriophage against EPEC<ORGANIZATION> was isolated from hospital sewage. The bacteriophage had an icosahedral head ( 120 nm ) and a tail ( 138 nm ). The single dose of the bacteriophage ( 2 Ã— 109 pfu ml-1 ) was able to control the infection. Unfortunately, because of the misuse of antibiotics by EPEC<ORGANIZATION> infected patients, the antibiotic resistant bacteria will become prevalent in the future and the treatment of EPEC<ORGANIZATION> infection is going to become more difficult than ever.
