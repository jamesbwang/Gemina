 Clinical<PERSON> and experimental studies support the notion that adrenergic stimulation and chronic stress affect inflammation, metabolism, and tumor growth. Eicosanoids are also known to heavily influence inflammation while regulating certain stress responses. However, additional work is needed to understand the full extent of interactions between the stress-related pathways and eicosanoids. Here, we review the potential influences that stress, inflammation, and metabolic pathways have on each other, in the context of eicosanoids. Understanding the intricacies of such interactions could provide insights on how systemic metabolic effects mediated by the stress pathways can be translated into therapies for cancer and other diseases.
