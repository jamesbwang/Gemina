 Ribonucleoproteins particles that form the spliceosomes are among the most frequently targeted molecules of the autoimmune response. In the last few years, autoantibodies against all A/B hnRNP proteins have been found in the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ), systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE<ORGANIZATION> ), mixed connective tissue disease ( MCTD<ORGANIZATION> ), and serve as diagnostic markers for several rheumatic diseases. However, the functional role of hnRNP<ORGANIZATION> C1/C2 in autoimmune diseases is still not clearly understood. To identify hnRNP<ORGANIZATION> C1/C2 as an autoantigen in patients with Behcet<PERSON> 's Disease<GPE> ( BD ). First, HaCaT<ORGANIZATION> and EA.hy926 cells were cultured and RNA<ORGANIZATION> was extracted. Second, amplification of the corresponding gene by RT-PCR, cloning, and purification techniques was applied to acquire the recombinant protein hnRNP<ORGANIZATION> C1/C2. Third<PERSON>, the target protein band was excised from gel electrophoresis, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by ( MALDI-TOF/ ). Finally, Western<GPE> blotting and ELISA<ORGANIZATION> were performed to verify the immunoreactivity of BD<ORGANIZATION> serum with recombinant hnRNPC1/C2. Results<PERSON> demonstrated that the reactivity of BD<ORGANIZATION> serum against recombinant hnRNP<ORGANIZATION> C1/C2 protein was significantly higher as compared to healthy control ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). hnRNP<ORGANIZATION> C1/C2 can be considered as a self antigen which might be involved in BD<GPE> pathology in Hans<GPE> Chinese<GPE> population.
