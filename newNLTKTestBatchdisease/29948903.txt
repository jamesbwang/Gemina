 The relation of white matter hyperintense lesions to episodic memory impairment in patients with Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease ( PD ) is still controversial. We aimed at evaluating the relation between white matter hyperintense lesions and episodic memory decline in patients with PD<ORGANIZATION>. In this multicentric prospective study, twenty-one normal controls, 15 PD patients without mild cognitive impairment ( MCI<ORGANIZATION> ) and 13 PD patients with MCI<ORGANIZATION> were selected to conduct a clinico-radiological correlation analysis. Performance during episodic memory testing, age-related white matter changes score, total manual and automated white matter hyperintense lesions volume and lobar white matter hyperintense lesions volumes were compared between groups using the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon<PERSON> signed-rank tests, and correlations were assessed using the Spearman<ORGANIZATION> test. MCI<ORGANIZATION> PD patients had impaired free recall. They also had higher total, left prefrontal and left temporal white matter hyperintense lesions volumes than normal controls. Free recall performance was negatively correlated with the total white matter hyperintense lesions volume, either manually or automatically delineated, but not with the age-related white matter changes score. Using automated segmentation, both the left prefrontal and temporal white matter hyperintense lesions volumes were negatively correlated with the free recall performance. Early episodic memory impairment in MCI<ORGANIZATION> PD patients may be related to white matter hyperintense lesions, mainly in the prefrontal and temporal lobes. This relation is influenced by the method used for white matter hyperintense lesions quantification. Automated volumetry allows for detecting those changes.
