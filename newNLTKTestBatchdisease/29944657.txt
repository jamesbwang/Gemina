 Diutina<GPE> catenulata ( Candida<GPE> catenulata ) is an ascomycetous yeast that has been isolated from humans, animals and environmental sources. The species is a contaminant of dairy products, and has been linked to superficial and invasive infections in both humans and animals. Previous phylogenetic analyses have assigned the species to the Saccharomycetales<GPE>, but failed to identify its specific clade. Here, we report the genome sequence of an environmental isolate of D. catenulata. Examination of the tRNA<ORGANIZATION> repertoire and coding potential of this species shows that it translates the CUG<ORGANIZATION> codon as serine and not leucine. In addition, two phylogenetic analyses using 204 ubiquitous gene family alignments and 3,826 single-copy genes both confirm the placement of the species in the Debaryomycetaceae/Metschnikowiaceae, or CTG-Ser clade. The sequenced isolate contains an MTLα<ORGANIZATION> idiomorph. However, unlike most MTL<ORGANIZATION> loci in related species, poly ( A ) polymerase ( PAP<ORGANIZATION> ) is not adjacent to MTLα1<ORGANIZATION>.
