 With increasing the usage of myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI<ORGANIZATION> ) for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, we aimed to evaluate the side effects of low-dose radiation induced by this technique on blood elements, especially proteins and liver function factors. 40 eligible patients ( Mean<ORGANIZATION> age: 54.62Â±10.35, 22 female and 18 male ), who had referred to the nuclear medicine department for MPI<ORGANIZATION> from May till August 2014, were enrolled in the study. A blood sample was taken from each patient just before and 24 hours after the injection of 740Mbq of Tecnetium-99m Methoxy isobutyl isonitrile ( 99mTc-MIBI ) in the rest phase of the MPI<ORGANIZATION> in a reference medical laboratory ; blood tests included total protein ( TP ), albumin ( Alb<PERSON> ), globulin ( Glo ), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST<ORGANIZATION> ), alanine transaminase ( ALT<ORGANIZATION> ), alkaline phosphatase ( ALP<ORGANIZATION> ), direct bilirubin ( D.Bili ), total bilirubin ( T.Bili ), serum iron ( SI ), total iron bounding capacity ( TIBC<ORGANIZATION> ), Albumin<PERSON> globulin ratioA/G ratio ), and complete blood count ( CBC<ORGANIZATION> ). Injection of 740Mbq99mTc-MIBI caused a significant increase in serum levels of AST<ORGANIZATION> ( p= 0.001 ), ALT<ORGANIZATION> ( p= 0.001 ), SI<GPE> ( p= 0.030 ), TIBC<GPE> ( p= 0.003 ) and A/G Ratio ( p= 0.020 ). However, following radiotracer injection, a significant decrease was noted in the serum levels of TP<GPE> ( p= 0.002 ), Alb<PERSON> ( p= 0.014 ), Glo<GPE> ( p= 0.002 ), ALP<ORGANIZATION> ( p= 0.001 ), D.Bili<GPE> ( p= 0.003 ) and T.Bili ( p= 0.000 ). Due to increased usage of MPI<ORGANIZATION>, our data highlights the importance of monitoring the clinical and paraclinical effects of the procedure on vital organs and physiological pathways to reduce their adverse effects.
