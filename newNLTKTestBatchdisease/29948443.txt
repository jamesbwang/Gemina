 While glucocorticosteroids ( GCS<ORGANIZATION> ) are widely used in patients with kidney disease, little is known about their effect on serum creatinine, the most commonly used endogenous marker of kidney function. We assessed the effect of GCS<ORGANIZATION> on the relationship between estimated GFR<ORGANIZATION> using the Schwartz<ORGANIZATION> equation ( eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) and measured GFR<ORGANIZATION> using a single-injection inulin clearance ( Cin ) in children both in a paired analysis and a cross-sectional study. Primary outcome variable was the difference between eGFR<ORGANIZATION> and Cin<GPE> ( ΔGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) in a paired analysis involving 22 patients during and off GCS<ORGANIZATION> treatment ( mean GFR 103.8 ml/min/1.73 m The paired analysis showed no significant difference in ΔGFR<ORGANIZATION> with or without GCS<ORGANIZATION> [ - 23 ( SD 53 ) vs. - 9 ( SD 41 ) ml/min/1.73 m GCS<ORGANIZATION> use had no significant effect on serum creatinine as a marker for kidney function in a mixed population of renal outpatient clinic children.
