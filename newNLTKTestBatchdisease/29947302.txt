 Single<GPE> nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ) of Toll-like receptors ( TLRs<ORGANIZATION> ) have been associated with functional modification or impairment of cytokine responses. In chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection, studies of TLR<ORGANIZATION> polymorphisms have primarily targeted receptor pathways implicated in viral immune responses. We hypothesized that one or more variant ( s ) of TLR3<ORGANIZATION>, TLR7<ORGANIZATION> and TLR8<ORGANIZATION> are associated with different outcomes of HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection. A total of 3368 subjects from 850 families were recruited and divided into three main groups categorized as chronic HCV<ORGANIZATION> ( CHCV<ORGANIZATION> ), spontaneous viral clearance ( SVC<ORGANIZATION> ), and controls. All individuals were genotyped for three SNPs<ORGANIZATION> for TLR3<ORGANIZATION>, two SNPs<ORGANIZATION> for TLR7<ORGANIZATION>, and two SNPs<ORGANIZATION> for TLR8<ORGANIZATION> using allelic discrimination real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION>. Carriage of the C allele in three SNPs<ORGANIZATION> of TLR3<ORGANIZATION> ( rs3775290, rs3775291, and rs5743312 ), the C allele in TLR7<GPE> ( rs3853839 ) in females only, and the C allele in TLR8<GPE> ( rs3764879 ) in males only were significantly higher in SVC<ORGANIZATION> group than CHCV<ORGANIZATION> group ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), while carriage of the T allele in TLR7<GPE> ( rs179008 ) in females only and the A allele in TLR8<GPE> ( rs3764880 ) in both males and females were significantly higher in CHCV<GPE> infection more than SVC<ORGANIZATION> group ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). The C allele is protective of HCV<ORGANIZATION> in TLR3<GPE>, TLR7<ORGANIZATION> ( rs3853839 ) in females only, and TLR8<ORGANIZATION> ( rs3764879 ) in males only, while risk of infection is linked to the T allele in TLR7<GPE> ( rs179008 ) in females only and the A allele in TLR8<GPE> ( rs3764880 ) in both sexes.
