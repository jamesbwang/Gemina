 Public<GPE> report of surgical site infections ( SSI<ORGANIZATION> ) rates has been an important component of SSI<ORGANIZATION> reduction strategies, and risk adjustment is needed before SSI<ORGANIZATION> rates are publicly reported. Improving the risk adjustment model facilitates meaningful comparison in the public reporting of SSIs<ORGANIZATION>. This research aimed to explore an optimal risk adjustment model for the public reporting of cesarean section ( CS ) SSI<ORGANIZATION>. Information on 2506 cases of CS<ORGANIZATION> performed at T hospital, a tertiary general hospital located in the W City of H Province in China<GPE>, from 01 January 2013 to 31 December 2014 was collected. The data were used to construct the multivariate risk adjustment models of CS<ORGANIZATION> SSI through logistic and Poisson<PERSON> stepwise regression. The c-index was used to compare the predictive power between the new logistic regression and the National Nosocomial Infections<ORGANIZATION> Surveillance ( NNIS<ORGANIZATION> ) risk index model. Pearson<PERSON> goodness-of-fit was determined to compare the goodness-of-fit between the new Poisson<PERSON> regression and the NNIS<ORGANIZATION> risk index model. The two new regression models were also compared. The logistic and Poisson<PERSON> regression models included two patient-related risk factors, namely, BMI<ORGANIZATION> ( OR=1.085, P=0.006<GPE> ; RR=1.081, P=0.006 ) and ASA<ORGANIZATION> score ( OR=1.522, P=0.044<GPE> ; RR=1.501, P=0.047 ). The c-index of the logistic regression model ( 0.628 ) was higher than that of the NNIS<ORGANIZATION> risk index model ( 0.600 ). The goodness-of-fit of the Poisson<ORGANIZATION> regression model ( 0.946 ) was better than that of the NNIS<ORGANIZATION> risk index model ( 0.851 ). The logistic and Poisson<PERSON> regression risk models are better than the NNIS<ORGANIZATION> risk index model, implying that a multifactorial risk adjustment model is needed for the public reporting of CS<ORGANIZATION> SSI. The advantage of logistic regression model is that the predictive power of model can be evaluated by c-index, however, Poisson<PERSON> regression may offer more advantages on model accuracy than logistic regression does when the infection rate decreases.
