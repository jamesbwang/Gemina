 Spitz<GPE> nevus commonly appears as a solitary lesion. A 12-year-old male patient presented with a 6-month history of several pigmented lesions on his trunk and lower extremities. He had undergone chemoradiotherapy and unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation against recurring acute lymphoblastic leukemia for 6 years. After that, several pigmented lesions abruptly developed on his trunk and lower extremities, and the number of those increased significantly. Pathologically, the diagnosis of multiple Spitz nevi was made. In a clinical correlation, we diagnosed multiple Spitz nevi resulting from such an immunocompromised condition. This is the first description of clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathologic features of multiple Spitz nevi in the hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HSCT<ORGANIZATION> ) recipient child.
