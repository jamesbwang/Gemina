 Systemic<GPE> lupus erythematosus ( SLE<ORGANIZATION> ) patients have a high risk for cardiovascular events, but few studies have evaluated the recognition and none have evaluated the control of cardiovascular risk factors ( RF ) in SLE<ORGANIZATION> patients. The study aims to describe the recognition and control frequencies of systemic arterial hypertension ( SAH<ORGANIZATION> ), dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus ( DM ) in SLE<ORGANIZATION> patients. Of the female patients with SLE<ORGANIZATION>, 137 answered a questionnaire focused on general knowledge of the RF<ORGANIZATION> for coronary artery disease ( CAD<ORGANIZATION> ) and on recognition of the risk factors that they possess. The patient 's information collected on a structured medical record was reviewed to evaluate the RF<ORGANIZATION> control. The mean age was 29.1 ( 9.6 ) years. Seventy patients had SAH<ORGANIZATION> ; 85.7 % recognized their condition and 71.4 % had desirable blood pressure ( BP ) control ( < 140 Ã— 90 mmHg ). From a group of 63 patients with dyslipidemia, 68.3 % recognized that they had dyslipidemia and 69.8 % had desirable LDL-cholesterol ( < 130 mg/dL ). Sixteen patients had DM<ORGANIZATION> ; 87.5 % admitted being diabetic and 50.0 % had desirable glycemic control ( HbA1C<ORGANIZATION> < 7 % ). Most patients were aware of presenting SAH<ORGANIZATION>, DM<ORGANIZATION>, or dyslipidemia, and the recognition frequency was higher in comparison to general population. The SAH<ORGANIZATION> and dyslipidemia control frequencies were higher than that described for the general population.
