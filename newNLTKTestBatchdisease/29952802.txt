 We present a time-series analysis of shear-mediated platelet activation ( SMPA<ORGANIZATION> ) in a patient supported by a left ventricular assist device ( LVAD<ORGANIZATION> ) who developed recurrent thromboembolic events over the course of support. The patient showed marked alterations of SMPA<ORGANIZATION> as quantified via the platelet activity state ( PAS<ORGANIZATION> ) assay. At the time of a first pump thrombosis, PAS<ORGANIZATION> was equal to 16.2 ± 2.1 %, indicating a significant level of SMPA<ORGANIZATION>. A moderate decrease of PAS<ORGANIZATION> was observed 30 days after pump exchange ( PAS<ORGANIZATION> = 9.5 ± 1.0 % ). A sudden PAS<ORGANIZATION> increase was recorded after 60 days ( PAS<ORGANIZATION> = 60.5 ± 4.3 % ), and an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation was subsequently diagnosed at 120 days after pump exchange ( PAS<ORGANIZATION> = 86.9 ± 7.5 % ) ; high PAS<ORGANIZATION> values did not recover over time likely because of sustained platelet activation from the inflammatory milieu caused by a driveline infection occurred at 240 days of support ( PAS<ORGANIZATION> = 84.4 ± 7.3 % ). Platelet activity state values were completely reversed after heart transplantation ( PAS<ORGANIZATION> = 0.6 ± 0.1 % ), demonstrating resolution of SMPA<ORGANIZATION>. This study provides further insight into our understanding of the pathogenesis of LVAD<ORGANIZATION> thrombosis, addressing SMPA<ORGANIZATION> as a relevant key factor associated with thrombotic complications. With the PAS<ORGANIZATION> assay, we have identified a reliable biomarker to promote tailored pharmacological therapy for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with LVADs<ORGANIZATION>.
