 The presence of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs<ORGANIZATION> ) has been found to correlate with colorectal cancer ( CRC<ORGANIZATION> ) prognosis, whereas epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT<ORGANIZATION> ) in CTCs<ORGANIZATION> has been found to be associated with CRC<ORGANIZATION> metastasis. LGR5<ORGANIZATION> is a known target of Wnt signaling and plays an important role in CRC<ORGANIZATION> development. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical relevance of EMT<ORGANIZATION> and LGR5<ORGANIZATION> expression in CTCs<ORGANIZATION> from CRC<ORGANIZATION> patients. Sixty-six CRC<ORGANIZATION> patients were included in this study. The detection and expression of EMT<ORGANIZATION> phenotypes in CTCs<ORGANIZATION> from these patients were assessed using CanPatrol™ CTC enrichment and mRNA<ORGANIZATION> in situ hybridization ( ISH<ORGANIZATION> ), respectively. LGR5<ORGANIZATION> expression in the CTCs<ORGANIZATION> was assessed using mRNA<ORGANIZATION> ISH. CTCs were detected in 86.4 % ( 57/66 ) of the CRC<ORGANIZATION> patients included. Both the numbers of total CTCs<ORGANIZATION> and of CTCs<ORGANIZATION> displaying a mesenchymal phenotype ( M+ CTCs ) were found to significantly correlate with advanced disease stages and the occurrence of metastasis ( p < 0.05 ). An adjusted multivariate analysis also indicated that the number of M+ CTCs significantly correlated with the occurrence of metastasis ( p = 0.031 ). Additionally, we found that a high LGR5<ORGANIZATION> expression level significantly correlated with the occurrence of metastasis ( p < 0.05 ). We also found that the presence of ≥ 6 CTCs or ≥ 3 M+ CTCs per 5 ml blood significantly correlated with disease progression ( p < 0.05 ). Patients with ≥ 6 CTCs or ≥ 3 M+ CTCs per 5 ml blood were found to exhibit poorer progression-free survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) and overall survival ( OS ) rates ( p < 0.05 in all cases ). Using Cox<PERSON> regression analyses, we found that only total CTC<ORGANIZATION> numbers remained as independent prognostic factors for a worse PFS<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.043 ). From our data we conclude that CTC<ORGANIZATION> numbers and EMT<ORGANIZATION> phenotypes may serve as prognostic markers for disease progression and metastasis in CRC<ORGANIZATION> patients. In addition, we conclude that LGR5<ORGANIZATION> expression in CTCs<ORGANIZATION> may serve as a marker for CRC<ORGANIZATION> metastasis.
