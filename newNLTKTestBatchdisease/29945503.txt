 Dengue<GPE> fever is a febrile illness caused by Dengue Virus<PERSON>, which belongs to the Flaviviridae<GPE> family. Among its proteome, the nonstructural protein 5 ( NS5<ORGANIZATION> ) is the biggest and most conserved. It has a primer-independent RNA-dependent RNA<ORGANIZATION> polymerase ( RdRp<ORGANIZATION> ) domain at its C-Terminus. Zou et al. studied the biological relevance of the two conserved cavities ( named A and B ) within the NS5<ORGANIZATION> proteins of dengue virus ( DENV<ORGANIZATION> ) and West Nile Virus<LOCATION> ( WNV<ORGANIZATION> ) using mutagenesis and revertant analysis and found four mutations located at cavity B having effects on viral replication. They recommended Cavity B<PERSON>, but not Cavity A as a potential target for drugs against flavivirus RdRp<ORGANIZATION>. In this study, we virtually screened the MayBridge<ORGANIZATION> drug fragments dataset for potential small molecule binders of cavity B using both AutoDock Vina<ORGANIZATION>, the standard docking tool, and QuickVina<ORGANIZATION> 2, our previously developed tool. We selected 16 fragments that appeared in the top 100 docking results of each of the representative structures of NS5<ORGANIZATION>. Visual inspection suggests that they have reasonable binding poses. The 16 predicted fragments are plausible drug candidates and should be considered for further validation, optimization, and linking to come up with a suitable inhibitor of dengue virus.
