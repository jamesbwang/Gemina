 Approximately 15,000 persons aged < 20 years receive a cancer diagnosis each year in the United States<GPE> ( 1 ). National surveillance data could provide understanding of geographic variation in occurrence of new cases to guide public health planning and investigation ( 2,3 ). Past<PERSON> research on pediatric cancer incidence described differences by U.S.<GPE> Census region but did not provide state-level estimates ( 4 ). To adequately describe geographic variation in cancer incidence among persons aged < 20 years in the United States<GPE>, CDC<ORGANIZATION> analyzed data from United States<GPE> Cancer Statistics<ORGANIZATION> ( USCS<ORGANIZATION> ) during 2003-2014 and identified 171,432 cases of pediatric cancer during this period ( incidence = 173.7 cases per 1 million persons ). The cancer types with the highest incidence rates were leukemias ( 45.7 ), brain tumors ( 30.9 ), and lymphomas ( 26.2 ). By U.S.<GPE> Census region, pediatric cancer incidence was highest in the Northeast<GPE> ( 188.0 ) and lowest in the South<GPE> ( 168.0 ), whereas by state ( including the District<ORGANIZATION> of Columbia<GPE> [ DC ] ), rates were highest in New Hampshire<GPE>, DC<ORGANIZATION>, and New Jersey<GPE>. Among non-Hispanic whites ( whites ) and non-Hispanic blacks ( blacks ), pediatric cancer incidence was highest in the Northeast<LOCATION>, and the highest rates among Hispanics were in the South<LOCATION>. The highest rates of leukemia were in the West<LOCATION>, and the highest rates of lymphoma and brain tumors were in the Northeast<LOCATION>. State-based differences in pediatric cancer incidence could guide interventions related to accessing care ( e.g., in states with large distances to pediatric oncology centers ), clinical trial enrollment, and state or regional studies designed to further explore variations in cancer incidence.
