 The role of gastric resection in treating metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma is controversial. In the present study, we reviewed the short- and long-term outcomes of stage IV patients undergoing surgery. A retrospective review was conducted that assessed patients undergoing elective surgery for incurable gastric carcinoma. Short- and long-term results were evaluated. A total of 122 stage IV gastric cancer patients were assessed. Postoperative mortality was 5.7 %, and the overall rate of complications was 35.2 %. The overall survival rate at 1 and 3 years was 58 and 19 % respectively ; the median survival was 14 months. Improved<PERSON> survival was observed for the factors age less than 60 years ( p = 0.015 ), site of metastases ( p = 0.022 ), extended lymph node dissection ( p = 0.044 ), absence of residual disease after surgery ( p = 0.001 ), and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy ( p = 0.016 ). Multivariate analysis showed that residual disease and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors. The results of this study suggest that surgery combined with systemic chemotherapy in selected patients with stage IV gastric cancer can improve survival.
