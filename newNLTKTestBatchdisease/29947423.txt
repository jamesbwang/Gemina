 Mycosporine-2-glycine ( M2G ), isolated from the halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece<GPE> halophytica, was purified and characterized in order to determine its utility as a cosmetic and pharmaceutical ingredient. M2G<PERSON> efficiently inhibited protein crosslinking. The inhibitory activity of M2G<PERSON> was significantly greater than that of the well-known Maillard<ORGANIZATION> reaction inhibitor Aminogluanide<GPE> ( AG ). In addition, M2G<PERSON>, as well as other known mycosporine-like amino acids, inhibited bacterial collagenase activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing that M2G<PERSON> specifically inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end-products ( AGEs<ORGANIZATION> ), which play a critical role in aging process and age-related diseases. These observations indicate that M2G<PERSON> may have potential therapeutic applications by suppressing the formation of AGEs<ORGANIZATION> and inhibiting excess collagenase activity.
