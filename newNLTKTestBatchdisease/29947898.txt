 Infectious diseases remain one of the major causes of death worldwide in developing countries. While screening via conventional polymerase chain reaction ( PCR<ORGANIZATION> ) is the gold standard in laboratory testing, its limited applications at the point-of-care have prompted the development of more portable nucleic acid detection systems. These include isothermal DNA<ORGANIZATION> amplification techniques, which are less equipment-intensive than PCR<ORGANIZATION>. Unfortunately, these techniques still require extensive sample preparation, limiting user accessibility. In this study, we introduce a novel system that combines thermophilic helicase-dependent amplification ( tHDA<ORGANIZATION> ) with a Triton<ORGANIZATION> X-100 micellar aqueous two-phase system ( ATPS<ORGANIZATION> ) to achieve cell lysis, lysate processing, and enhanced nucleic acid amplification in a simple, one-step process. The combined one-pot system was able to amplify and detect a target gene from whole-cell samples containing as low as 10
