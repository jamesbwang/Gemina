 We examined the upregulation of ET-1/ETBR/eNOS signaling in renoprotective effect of vitamin D in kidney fibrosis model in mice using unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO<ORGANIZATION> ). One group was treated with intraperitoneal injection of 0.125 mg/kg of Calcitriol<GPE> ( UUO+VD ). Vascular remodeling was quantified based on lumen area and lumen/wall area ratio ( LWAR<ORGANIZATION> ) of intrarenal arteries using Sirius Red<PERSON> staining. ET-1, ETBR<ORGANIZATION>, eNOS<ORGANIZATION>, CD31<ORGANIZATION> and VEGF<ORGANIZATION> mRNA expressions were quantified using qRT-PCR. Focusing on endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) signaling in endothelial cells ( EC ), siRNA of ET-1<ORGANIZATION> was performed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC<ORGANIZATION> ) for reducing ET-1 expression. Then HUVECs<ORGANIZATION> were treated with and without 100 nM Calcitriol<GPE> treatment in hypoxic and normoxic conditions to elucidate ET-1/eNOS signaling. Our in vivo study revealed vascular remodeling and renal ischemia attenuation after Calcitriol<GPE> treatment. Vascular remodeling was attenuated in the UUO+VD group as shown by increasing lumen areas and LWAR<ORGANIZATION> in intrarenal arteries. These findings were associated with significant higher CD31<ORGANIZATION> and VEGF<ORGANIZATION> mRNA expression compared to the UUO<ORGANIZATION> group. Vitamin D<PERSON> treatment also increased ET-1, ETBR<ORGANIZATION> and eNOS mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expressions. Our in vitro study demonstrated Calcitriol<PERSON> induced ET-1 and eNOS mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expressions upregulation in HUVEC<ORGANIZATION> under normoxic and hypoxic condition. Meanwhile, siRNA for ET-1<ORGANIZATION> inhibited the upregulation of eNOS<ORGANIZATION> mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression after Calcitriol<GPE> treatment. Vitamin D<PERSON> ameliorates kidney fibrosis through attenuating vascular remodeling and ischemia with upregulating ET-1/ETBR and eNOS<ORGANIZATION> expression.
