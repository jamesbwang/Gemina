 Primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC<ORGANIZATION> ) is relatively rare disease and pathogenesis and methods of treatments were still not established. Then, we had conducted the making clinical guidelines to manage patients with PSC<ORGANIZATION> based on the literature review and expert opinions. These clinical guidelines were made for the medical doctors on the management of PSC<ORGANIZATION>, except child case of PSC<ORGANIZATION>. We had employed modified Delphi<PERSON> method. The production committee decided guidelines, strength of recommendations and evidence level after reviewed literatures systematically, and The Expert<GPE> panel evaluated those. The Scientific Committee<ORGANIZATION> of the Japan<GPE> Biliary Association ( JBA<ORGANIZATION> ) evaluated revised guidelines, and the Public<ORGANIZATION> comments were collected on web site of JBA<ORGANIZATION>. We had made 16 guidelines about epidemiology/pathophysiology, diagnostics, therapy and prognosis. Also, we had made both diagnostic and therapeutic flow chart. We hope that these guidelines will contribute to the improvement and development of the medical care of PSC<ORGANIZATION>.
