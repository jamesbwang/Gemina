 Hepatitis<PERSON> B<ORGANIZATION> virus ( HBV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection remains a global health problem. As `` cure '' for chronic hepatitis B is of current priority, hepatitis B immunoglobulin ( HBIG<ORGANIZATION> ) has been utilized for several decades to provide post-exposure prophylaxis. In recent years, a number of monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs<ORGANIZATION> ) targeting HBV<ORGANIZATION> have been developed and demonstrated with high affinity, specificity, and neutralizing potency. HBV neutralizing antibodies may play potentially significant role in the search for an HBV<ORGANIZATION> cure. In this review, we will summarize the recently progress in developing HBV-neutralizing antibodies, describe their characteristics and potential clinical applications. HBV neutralizing antibodies could be a promising alternative in the prevention and treatment of HBV<ORGANIZATION> infection. More importantly, global collaboration and coordinated approaches are thus needed to facilitate the development of novel therapies for HBV<ORGANIZATION> infection.
