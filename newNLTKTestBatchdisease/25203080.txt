 Clinical<PERSON> trial data are the gold standard for evaluating pharmaceutical safety and efficacy. There is an ethical and scientific imperative for transparency and data sharing to confirm published results and generate new knowledge. The Open Translational Science<ORGANIZATION> in Schizophrenia<GPE> ( OPTICS<ORGANIZATION> ) Project<PERSON> was an open-science initiative aggregating Janssen<PERSON> clinical trial and NIH/NIMH data from real-world studies and trials in schizophrenia. The project aims were to show the value of using shared data to examine: therapeutic safety and efficacy ; disease etiologies and course ; and methods development. The success of project investigators was due to collaboration from project applications through analyses, with support from the Harvard Catalyst<ORGANIZATION>. Project work was independent of Janssen<GPE> ; all intellectual property was dedicated to the public. Efforts such as this are necessary to gain deeper insights into the biology of disease, foster collaboration, and to achieve the goal of developing better treatments, reducing the overall public health burden of devastating brain diseases.
