 Commercial sex shares a role in HIV<ORGANIZATION> and sexually transmitted infections ( STI<ORGANIZATION> ) transmission. Men who pay for sex ( MPS<ORGANIZATION> ) may transmit HIV/STI to other populations which are low-risk. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that MPS<ORGANIZATION> engage in high-risk sexual behaviors associated with HIV/STI transmission more so than non-MPS. This cross-sectional study included heterosexual men who attended an STI<ORGANIZATION> clinic between 2003 and 2010. Demographic, clinical, behavioral and laboratory data were compared between MPS<ORGANIZATION> and non-MPS to identify factors associated with high-risk sexual behavior and STI-burden. Of the first visits of 6156 heterosexual men who attended the STI-clinic during the study period, 1649 ( 26.7 % ) were MPS<ORGANIZATION>. MPS were more commonly older, married and non-Israeli born compared with non-MPS. MPS were more likely to engage in risk-behaviors associated with HIV/STI-transmission, including a greater number of lifetime sexual partners, substance use and previous STI<ORGANIZATION> diagnoses. Determinants associated with STI-diagnoses at the current visit included being non-Israeli born, presenting with STI<ORGANIZATION> symptoms, reporting a greater number of lifetime sexual partners and having sexual encounters with non-Israeli individuals. Approximately 25 % of all men who attended the clinic were MPS<ORGANIZATION>. They were more likely to engage in risk-behaviors associated with HIV/STI transmission compared to non-MPS. These findings highlight the need to establish interventions for MPS<ORGANIZATION> that both continue to encourage condom use and address the potential perils pertaining to risky sexual behaviors.
