 There is a paucity of data on the epidemiology of sepsis in outborn neonates being referred to level-3 units in low- and middle-income countries ( LMIC<ORGANIZATION> ). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of sepsis and outcomes of outborn neonates with sepsis, and to characterize the pathogen profile and antimicrobial resistance ( AMR<ORGANIZATION> ) patterns of common isolates in them. In this prospective observational cohort study ( 2011-2015 ), a dedicated research team enrolled all neonates admitted to an outborn level-3 neonatal unit and followed them until discharge/death. Sepsis work-up including blood culture ( s ) was performed upon suspicion of sepsis. All the isolates were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Gram-negative pathogens resistant to any three of the five antibiotic classes ( extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin-tazobactam ) were labeled multi-drug resistant. Of the total of 2588 neonates enrolled, culture positive sepsis and total sepsis-i.e. culture positive and/or culture negative sepsis-was diagnosed in 13.1 % ( 95 % CI 11.8 % to 14.5 % ) and 54.7 % ( 95 % CI 52.8 % to 56.6 % ), respectively. The case fatality rates were 23.4 % and 11.0 % in culture-positive and total sepsis, respectively. Sepsis<PERSON> accounted for two-thirds of total neonatal deaths ( 153/235, 63.0 % ). Bacterial isolates caused about three-fourths ( 296/401 ; 73.8 % ) of the infections. The two common pathogens-Klebsiella pneumoniae ( n = 50, 12.5 % ) and Acinetobacter baumannii ( n = 46, 11.5 % ) -showed high degree of multi-drug resistance ( 78.0 % and 91.3 %, respectively ) and carbapenem resistance ( 84.0 % and 91.3 %, respectively ). About a quarter of infections were caused by Candida<GPE> spp. ( n = 91 ; 22.7 % ) ; almost three-fourths ( 73.7 % ) of these infections occurred in neonates born at or after 32 weeks ' gestation and about two-thirds ( 62.1 % ) in those weighing 1500 g or more at birth. In this large outborn cohort, we report high burden of sepsis, high prevalence of systemic fungal infections, and alarming rates of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens.
