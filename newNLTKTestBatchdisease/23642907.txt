 The PI3K/mTOR pathway is the second most frequently deregulated pathway in a majority of cancers such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanomas as well as leukemia. Mutations in the genes coding for receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs<ORGANIZATION> ) and G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs<ORGANIZATION> ) are quite common in all forms of acute leukemia. This can be a major cause of deregulation of the PI3K-mTOR pathway. To understand how cells display resistance to the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, we used a panel of 25 acute leukemia cell lines. We observed that while a number of cell lines displayed sensitivity to the dual PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor PKI-587, many cells displayed substantial resistance. Cells<PERSON> sensitive to PKI-587 also showed aberrant activation of PI3K/mTOR pathway components such as AKT<ORGANIZATION> and S6K<PERSON> and also displayed sensitivity to a panel of various other PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Using RNA<ORGANIZATION> sequencing data, we observed that expression of a G protein-coupled receptor, P2RY14<ORGANIZATION>, was upregulated nine-fold in cells showing resistance to the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. P2RY14<ORGANIZATION> has not been much studied in hematologic malignancies. However, this receptor seems to have a role in the localization of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) and in promoting regenerative capabilities following injury. We observed that acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL<ORGANIZATION> ) and FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ) patients with higher expression of P2RY14<ORGANIZATION> mRNA displayed relatively poor survival compared to patients carrying lower expression of P2RY14<ORGANIZATION> suggesting a role of P2RY14<ORGANIZATION> in patient survival. To understand the role of this receptor in cell signaling, we used phospho-protein arrays and observed activation of distinct signaling cascades. Furthermore, array data were verified using murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 stably transfected with P2RY14<ORGANIZATION>. We observed that activation of P2RY14<ORGANIZATION> by its ligand, UDP-glucose, resulted in selective induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our data suggest that acute leukemia cells resistant to PI3K/mTOR inhibition display upregulation of a GPCR<ORGANIZATION>, P2RY14<ORGANIZATION>, which has a role in patient survival and also couples to the activation of ERK<ORGANIZATION> signaling.
