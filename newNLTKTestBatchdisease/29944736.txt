 Association between BMI<ORGANIZATION> and periodontitis were controversial. A study indicated that not only overweight/obesity but also underweight was correlated with generalized aggressive periodontitis ( GAgP<ORGANIZATION> ). However, the exact relationship between BMI<ORGANIZATION> and GAgP<ORGANIZATION> and the optimal BMI<ORGANIZATION> value for the lowest risk of GAgP<ORGANIZATION> remain unknown. To explore the exact relationship between BMI<ORGANIZATION> and GAgP<ORGANIZATION> risk, periodontal status and WBC<ORGANIZATION> ( white blood cell ) count, and find the optimal BMI<ORGANIZATION> value associated with the lowest risk, periodontal status and lowest WBC<ORGANIZATION> of GAgP<ORGANIZATION> in Chinese<GPE>. 300 GAgP<ORGANIZATION> patients and 133 healthy controls were recruited. Height<PERSON> and weight of participants were accurately measured to calculate BMI<ORGANIZATION> value. Clinical<PERSON> periodontal parameters, including probing depth ( PD ), attachment loss ( AL<ORGANIZATION> ), bleeding index ( BI ) were recorded. WBC<ORGANIZATION> was obtained from blood routine examination. Smooth curve fitting and segmented regression model were used to analyze the threshold effect between BMI<ORGANIZATION> and variables. The shape of the curve was used to describe the relationships between BMI<ORGANIZATION> and GAgP<ORGANIZATION>. U-shaped relationships between BMI<ORGANIZATION> and risk of GAgP<ORGANIZATION>, AL<ORGANIZATION> and WBC<ORGANIZATION> count in GAgP<ORGANIZATION> patients were observed. The optimal value of BMI<ORGANIZATION> for the lowest risk of GAgP<ORGANIZATION> and lowest WBC<ORGANIZATION> count was 22 kg/m U-shaped relationships exist between BMI<ORGANIZATION> and risk of GAgP<ORGANIZATION>, AL<ORGANIZATION> and WBC<ORGANIZATION> count in patients with GAgP<ORGANIZATION> among Chinese<GPE> aged below 36 years old with their BMI range from 18 to 28 kg/m
