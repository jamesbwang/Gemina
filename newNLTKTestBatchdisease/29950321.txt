 Each nucleated cell contains several hundreds of mitochondria, which are unique organelles in being under dual genome control. The mitochondria contain their own DNA<ORGANIZATION>, the mtDNA<ORGANIZATION>, but most of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, including all the proteins required for replication, transcription, and repair of mtDNA<ORGANIZATION>. MtDNA replication is a continuous process that requires coordinated action of several enzymes that are part of the mtDNA<ORGANIZATION> replisome. It also requires constant supply of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ( dNTPs<ORGANIZATION> ) and interaction with other mitochondria for mixing and unifying the mitochondrial compartment. MtDNA maintenance defects are a growing list of disorders caused by defects in nuclear genes involved in different aspects of mtDNA<ORGANIZATION> replication. As a result of defects in these genes, mtDNA<ORGANIZATION> depletion and/or multiple mtDNA<ORGANIZATION> deletions develop in affected tissues resulting in variable manifestations that range from adult-onset mild disease to lethal presentation early in life.
