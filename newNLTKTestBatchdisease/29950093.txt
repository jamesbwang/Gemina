 Transketolases ( TK ) are ubiquitous thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP<ORGANIZATION> ) -dependent enzymes of the non-oxidative branch of pentose phosphate pathway. They are considered as interesting therapeutic target in numerous diseases and infections ( e.g. cancer, tuberculosis, malaria ), for which it is important to find specific and efficient inhibitors. Current TK<PERSON> assays require important amounts of enzyme, are time-consuming and are not specific. Here, we report a new high throughput electrochemical assay based on the oxidative trapping of the TK-TPP intermediate. After electrode characterization, enzyme loading, electrochemical protocol and substrate concentration were optimized. Finally, 96 electrochemical assays could be performed in parallel in only 7 minutes that allows a rapid screening of TK<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors. Then, 1360 molecules of an in-house chemical library were screened and one early lead compound was identify to inhibit TK from E. coli with an IC
