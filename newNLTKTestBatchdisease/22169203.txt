 Tau<GPE>, a microtubule-associated protein, is the main component of the intracellular filamentous inclusions that are involved in neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies, including Alzheimer<ORGANIZATION> disease ( AD ), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 ( FTDP-17 ), Pick<PERSON> disease ( PiD<ORGANIZATION> ), progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP<ORGANIZATION> ) and corticobasal degeneration ( CBD<ORGANIZATION> ). Hyperphosphorylated, aggregated tau proteins form the core of neurofibrillary tangles ( NFTs<ORGANIZATION> ), which are shown to be one of the pathological hallmarks of AD<ORGANIZATION>. The discovery of mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (
