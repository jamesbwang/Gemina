 To determine the change in vision and retinal structure in patients with the common c.2299delG mutation in the USH2A<ORGANIZATION> gene in anticipation of clinical trials of therapy. Retrospective observational case series. Eighteen patients, homozygotes or compound heterozygotes with the c.2299delG mutation in USH2A<GPE>, were studied with visual acuity, kinetic perimetry, dark- and light-adapted two-color static perimetry, optical coherence tomography ( OCT<ORGANIZATION> ) and autofluorescence ( AF ) imaging. Serial data were available for at least half of the patients depending on the parameter analyzed. The kinetics of disease progression in this specific molecular form of USH2A<ORGANIZATION> differed between the measured parameters. Visual acuity could remain normal for decades. Kinetic<PERSON> and light-adapted static perimetry across the entire visual field had similar rates of decline that were slower than those of rod-based perimetry. Horizontal<ORGANIZATION> OCT scans through the macula showed that IS/OS line width had a similar rate of constriction as co-localized AF imaging and cone-based light-adapted sensitivity extent. The rate of constriction of rod-based sensitivity extent across this same region was twice as rapid as that of cones. In patients with the c.2299delG mutation in USH2A<GPE>, rod photoreceptors are the cells that express disease early and more aggressively than cones. Rod-based vision measurements in central or extracentral-peripheral retinal regions warrant monitoring in order to complete a clinical trial in a timely manner.
