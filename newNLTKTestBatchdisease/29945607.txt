 Neuroinflammation<GPE> accompanies neural trauma and most neurological diseases. Axotomy<PERSON> in the peripheral nervous system ( PNS<ORGANIZATION> ) leads to dramatic changes in the injured neuron: the cell body expresses a distinct set of genes known as regeneration-associated genes, the distal axonal segment degenerates and its debris is cleared, and the axons in the proximal segment form growth cones and extend neurites. These processes are orchestrated in part by immune and other non-neuronal cells. Macrophages in ganglia play an integral role in supporting regeneration. Here, we explore further the molecular and cellular components of the injury-induced immune response within peripheral ganglia. Adult<PERSON> male wild-type ( WT ) and Ccr2 Chemokine<PERSON> expression in the ganglia differed 48 h after nerve injury with a large increase in macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î³ in the SCG<ORGANIZATION> but not in the DRG<ORGANIZATION>, while C-C class chemokine ligand 2 was highly expressed in both ganglia. Differences between WT<ORGANIZATION> and Ccr2<GPE> This study demonstrates both molecular and cellular differences in the nerve injury-induced immune response between DRG<ORGANIZATION> and SCG<ORGANIZATION> and between WT<ORGANIZATION> and Ccr2<PERSON>
