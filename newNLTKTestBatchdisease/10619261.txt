 We investigated the predictive role for serum free light chain ratio ( FLCr<ORGANIZATION> ) ≥100, bone marrow plasma cell ( BMPC<ORGANIZATION> ) ≥60 %, and evolving biomarkers through group-based trajectory modeling ( GBTM<ORGANIZATION> ) as high-risk defining events in 273 smoldering multiple myeloma ( SMM<ORGANIZATION> ) patients with a median follow-up of 74 months. FLCr<ORGANIZATION> ≥100 was confirmed as a marker for high-risk progression with a median time to progression ( TTP<ORGANIZATION> ) of 40 months with a 44 % risk of progression of disease ( PD ) at 2 years ; however, 44 % of FLCr<ORGANIZATION> ≥100 also did not progress during follow-up. For patients with BMPC<ORGANIZATION> ≥60 % by core biopsy, the median TTP<ORGANIZATION> was 31 months with a 2-year PD of 41 %. GBTM<ORGANIZATION> established high-risk trajectories for evolving hemoglobin ( eHb<ORGANIZATION> ; characterized as a 1.57 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin ), evolving m-protein ( eMP<ORGANIZATION> ; 64 % increase in m-protein ), and evolving differences in FLC<GPE> ( edFLC ; 169 % increase in dFLC<GPE> ) within 1 year of diagnosis associated with a decreased median TTP<ORGANIZATION> and an increased 2 year rate of PD<ORGANIZATION>. Of all the variables examined, we identify a model where immunoparesis, eHb<ORGANIZATION>, eMP<ORGANIZATION>, and edFLC<ORGANIZATION> were significant predictors for ultra-high-risk progression with a median TTP<ORGANIZATION> of only 13 months with 3 or more variables present. Our results not only confirm a more modest 2 year PD associated with FLCr<ORGANIZATION> ≥100 and BMPC<ORGANIZATION> ≥60 but also suggest that eHb<ORGANIZATION>, eMP<ORGANIZATION>, and edFLC<ORGANIZATION> may help identify an ultra-high-risk SMM<ORGANIZATION> group.
