 Toll<GPE> like receptors play a major role in immune responses against Leishmania<GPE> parasites. To evaluate the efficacy of vaccination with live attenuated L. major and TLR4<ORGANIZATION> agonist in protection against L. major infection. Attenuated L. major was prepared by continuous sub-culturing of the parasite. A total of 90 mice were assigned to 9 groups including 6 groups of BALB/c<GPE> ( G1-6 ) and 3 groups ( G7-9 ) of C57BL/6 mice. Group 1 was the control groups, group 2 received the wild-type L. major promastigotes, group 3 the attenuated line, group 4 the TLR4<ORGANIZATION> agonist, group 5 the wild-type L. major and TLR4<ORGANIZATION> agonist, and group 6 the attenuated line along with TLR4<ORGANIZATION> agonist. Group 7 was control, group 8 received wild-type L. major and group 9 the wild-type along with TLR4<ORGANIZATION> agonist. Vaccinated mice were then challenged with wild-type of L. major. Lesion<PERSON> size, parasite burden, and the expression levels of IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-2, 1L-17A, IL-10, TGF-β and TLR4<ORGANIZATION> were evaluated before the challenge while parasite burden and lesion size were evaluated. Vaccinated mice with a TLR4<ORGANIZATION> agonist or attenuated L. major plus TLR4<ORGANIZATION> agonist produced the highest levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-17A. Post-challenge analysis revealed that mice vaccinated with the attenuated line along with TLR4<ORGANIZATION> agonist displayed the lowest lesion size and parasite load. These mice developed a predominant Th1 immune response. Vaccination with the attenuated L. major along with TLR4<ORGANIZATION> agonist promotes a Th1-mediated immune response which leads to the protection of BALB/c mice against L. major infection.
