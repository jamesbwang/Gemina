 Eight kinds of provenance of Rheum<GPE> palmatum collected from 4 provinces Sichuan<PERSON>, Ningxia<PERSON>, Gansu<PERSON>, Shannxi<PERSON> as test materials, which were transplanted under 3 different environments by using complete randomized block design with three replicates. The contents of the chemical components was determined by HPLC<ORGANIZATION>. This study aimed at analyzing the effect of genotype, environment and their interactions on the 4 kinds of functional components ( phenolic acids, bianthrone, free anthraquinones and combined anthraquinones ) in 14 kinds of active components of R. palmatum, in order to provide a theoretical basis for the selection of cultivated R. palmatum in high quality producing area and excellent provenance. The functional components of R. palmatum were influenced by genotype and environment. The content of phenolic acids was mainly influenced by environment, and the other three kinds of functional components were affected by environment and their interactions. The proportion of environment was larger. The cultivation quality of R. palmatum should give priority to environment, then choose a provenance. Sichuan<PERSON> may be beneficial in accumulation of free anthraquinones in R. palmatum, Gansu<PERSON> may facilitate the binding of combined anthraquinone, phenolic acids and bianthrone content. Preliminary inference based on the content and proportion of efficacy components, P2<PERSON> could be potential special medicinal germplasm that have function of heat-clearing and detoxifying drugs. P6 could be potential special medicinal germplasm that activate blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis. P7 and P1 could all be potential specialmedicinal germplasms that exist diarrhea attack characters. The results of this study have important guiding significance for the production of rhubarb precision medicinal materials.
