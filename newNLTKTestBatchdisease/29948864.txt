 We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the association between the use of different anti-ulcer agents and the risk of chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ), end-stage renal disease ( ESRD<ORGANIZATION> ), and decline in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR<ORGANIZATION> ) in various study populations. PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Embase<GPE>, and the Cochrane<ORGANIZATION> Library were searched for relevant entries up to July 1, 2017. The primary outcomes of the meta-analysis were risk ratios ( RRs<ORGANIZATION> ) of CKD<ORGANIZATION>, ESRD<ORGANIZATION>, and decline in GFR<ORGANIZATION>. We also investigated the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis by subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis. A total of 662,624 individuals were enrolled in five trials. Compared with non-PPI users, PPI<ORGANIZATION> users had a higher trend of CKD<ORGANIZATION> ( RR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.16, 95 % CI 1.07-1.25, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), especially ESRD<ORGANIZATION> ( RR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.81, 95 % CI 1.59-2.06, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). There was an elevated risk of adverse renal outcome among participants receiving PPI<ORGANIZATION> and not H2RA<ORGANIZATION> ( CKD<ORGANIZATION>: RR = 1.28, 95 % CI 1.24-1.33, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ; ESRD: RR = 1.39, 95 % CI 1.17-1.64, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ; GFR: RR = 1.31, 95 % CI 1.26-1.36, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). However, H2RA<ORGANIZATION> users were not associated with CKD<ORGANIZATION> when compared with non-H2RA users ( RR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.02, 95 % CI 0.83-1.25, P<PERSON> = 0.855 ). In subgroup analysis, the average age of individuals and drug dosage had no influence on the risk of CKD<ORGANIZATION>, while duration of PPI<ORGANIZATION> exposure from 31 to 720 days is a potential factor in progression to ESRD<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). Chronic PPI<PERSON> use, but not H2RAs<ORGANIZATION>, is associated with deterioration in kidney function.
