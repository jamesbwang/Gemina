 Antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection has become increasingly effective. Persistent poor HIV outcomes in racial and ethnic minority populations in the US<GSP> call for a closer examination into why Latinos are at significant risk for acquiring and dying from HIV<ORGANIZATION>. To improve clinical outcomes and achieve an AIDS-free generation, HIV<ORGANIZATION> research must address disparities in HIV outcomes in Latinos<GPE>, the largest ethnic/racial minority population in the US<GSP>. Immigrant status as well as cultural factors influence HIV care utilization and are essential to highlight for effective intervention development in Latinos<GPE>. A better understanding of these individual and contextual factors is critical to developing tailored approaches to engaging Latinos<GPE> in HIV care. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we offer a framework for understanding what is needed from clinical practice and research to improve engagement in HIV care for US-based Latinos. These findings may have implications for other minority populations.
