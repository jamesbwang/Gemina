 A sound knowledge of the vector-host-parasite transmission dynamics is a prerequisite for adequate control measures of vector-borne diseases. To achieve this, an entomological investigation was conducted in the cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) endemic focus of Mokolo District<PERSON>, northern Cameroon in order to identify the insect vector ( s ) of the disease. Phlebotomine<PERSON> sand flies were collected in and around Mokolo<GPE> using New Standard<GPE> CDC Miniature Light Traps. Individual sand flies were used for morphological species identification, and the remainder of the body for DNA<ORGANIZATION> analysis. Sand<GPE> flies were demonstrated to harbor Leishmania<GPE> spp. parasites using ITS1<ORGANIZATION> PCR. Mitochondrial vertebrate-specific Cytochrome b -PCR was used for identifying blood meals ingested by female sand flies. PCR<ORGANIZATION> amplicons were sequenced for Leishmania<GPE> and blood sources discrimination. This study revealed the presence of Leishmania<GPE> donovani complex DNA<ORGANIZATION> ( n=1 ) in Phlebotomus<GPE> duboscqi and of lizard-borne Leishmania<GPE> tarentolae-like DNA<ORGANIZATION> ( n=3 ) in Sergentomyia<GPE> spp. in 79 sand fly specimens from Mokolo<GPE> district. The causative agent of CL<ORGANIZATION> could not be detected in potential vectors. Instead we found evidence for visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) parasites in Phlebotomus<GPE> duboscqi as well as enzootic reptile parasites in the Mokolo<GPE> area. We recommend that an epidemiological survey be carried out in the area to evaluate the prevalence and eventually describe the clinical manifestations of VL in the human population. Political instability in neighboring countries and the resulting refugee migration are likely explanations for the emergence of VL in Mokolo<GPE>. This article is protected by copyright.
