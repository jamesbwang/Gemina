 Inflammatory<GPE> bowel disease ( IBD<ORGANIZATION> ) patients are at increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, and preventive care guidelines in IBD<ORGANIZATION> favor annual skin examinations. Here we estimate the cost-effectiveness of annual melanoma screening in IBD<ORGANIZATION>. Melanoma<PERSON> screening was defined as receiving annual total body skin examinations starting at age 40 from a dermatologist. Screening was compared to US<GSP> background total body skin examination rates performed by primary care practitioners. A Markov<PERSON> model was used to estimate intervention costs and effectiveness. Future costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3 % per year over a lifetime horizon. Strategies were compared using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $ 100,000/quality-adjusted life year ( QALY<ORGANIZATION> ) gained. Annual<PERSON> melanoma screening cost an average of $ 1961 per patient, while no screening cost $ 81 per patient. Melanoma<PERSON> screening was more effective, gaining 9.2 QALYs per 1000 persons, at a cost of $ 203,400/QALY gained. Screening every other year was the preferred strategy, gaining 6.2 QALYs per 1000 persons and costing $ 143,959/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested the relative risk of melanoma in IBD<ORGANIZATION>, melanoma progression, and screening costs were most influential with clinically plausible variation, leading to scenarios costing < $ 100,000/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested screening every other year was cost-effective in 17.4 % of iterations. Screening for melanoma in IBD<ORGANIZATION> patients was effective but expensive. Screening every other year was the most cost-effective strategy. Studies to identify IBD<ORGANIZATION> patients at the highest risk of developing melanoma may assist in targeting a prevention program in the most cost-effective manner.
