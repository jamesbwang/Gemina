 Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC<ORGANIZATION> ) is a potentially fatal illness in premature neonates. Tumor<PERSON> necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) and autophagy are associated with the pathogenesis of NEC<ORGANIZATION>. This study aimed to explore whether TNF-α might regulate apoptosis in neonatal NEC<ORGANIZATION> model cells IEC-6 via regulation of autophagy. NEC<ORGANIZATION> rat model was induced by hand feeding and exposure to asphyxia/cold-stress for histologic examination. The NEC<ORGANIZATION> in vitro model ( IEC-6/NEC cells ) was established by stimulating the intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION>, 100 μg/mL ) for 3 h to investigate the effects of TNF-α on IEC-6 proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, NEC<ORGANIZATION> rats showed decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA<ORGANIZATION> ) expression, increased TUNEL-positive cells, higher expression of TNF-α, p-ERK1/2, and autophagy-related proteins in rat small intestine compared with their controls. Additionally, the LPS-stimulated IEC-6/NEC cells showed a significantly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis compared with the control cells. Furthermore, the LPS-stimulated IEC-6/NEC cells exhibited enhanced autophagy level, as evidenced by a dose-dependent increase in Beclin-1 protein expression, LC3II/LC3I ratio and accumulation of MDC-positive autophagic vacuoles. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin or LY294002<ORGANIZATION> significantly abolished the LPS-mediated decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of IEC-6/NEC cells. Results<PERSON> also showed that inhibition of ERK1/2 pathway using U0126<PERSON> significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced autophagy. Furthermore, the TNF-α-mediated inhibition of IEC-6 proliferation and promotion of IEC-6 apoptosis was abolished by U0126<PERSON>. Our findings demonstrated that TNF-α might induce autophagy through ERK1/2 pathway to regulate apoptosis in neonatal NEC<ORGANIZATION> cells IEC-6. Our study enhances our understanding of neonatal NEC<ORGANIZATION> pathogenesis.
