 Systemic<GPE> sclerosis is a progressive inflammatory disease that is frequently fatal and has limited treatment options. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AHCT<ORGANIZATION> ) has been evaluated as treatment for this disease in observational studies, multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials, and meta-analyses. On behalf of the American Society<ORGANIZATION> for Blood<PERSON> and Marrow Transplantation<PERSON> ( ASBMT<ORGANIZATION> ), a panel of experts in transplantation and rheumatology was convened to review available evidence and make a recommendation on AHCT<ORGANIZATION> as an indication for systemic sclerosis. Three randomized trials have compared the efficacy of AHCT<ORGANIZATION> with cyclophosphamide only and all demonstrated benefit for the AHCT<ORGANIZATION> arm for their primary endpoint ( improvement in ASSIST<ORGANIZATION>, event-free survival in ASTIS<GPE> trial and change in global rank composite score in SCOT<GPE> trial ). AHCT<ORGANIZATION> recipients also had better overall survival and a lower rate of disease progression. These findings have been confirmed in subsequent meta-analyses. Based on this high-quality evidence, the ASBMT<ORGANIZATION> recommends systemic sclerosis be considered as `` standard of care '' indication for AHCT<ORGANIZATION>. Close<PERSON> collaboration between rheumatologists and transplant clinicians is critical for optimizing patient selection and patient outcomes. Transplant centers in the United States<GPE> are strongly encouraged to report patient and outcomes data to the Center<ORGANIZATION> for International Blood<ORGANIZATION> and Marrow Transplant Research<PERSON> on their patients receiving AHCT<ORGANIZATION> for this indication.
