 Revisional and reconstructive surgery for IPAA<ORGANIZATION> is rare given the high success of pouch surgery for chronic ulcerative colitis. Limited data exist on both surgical and functional outcomes in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis who undergo IPAA<ORGANIZATION> revision or reconstruction. This study aimed to determine the surgical and functional outcome in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis who undergo IPAA<ORGANIZATION> revision or reconstruction. A prospectively collected surgical database was accessed for this study. This study was conducted at an IBD<ORGANIZATION> referral center. Patients with chronic ulcerative colitis who underwent IPAA<ORGANIZATION> revision or reconstruction were selected. The primary outcomes measured were 30-day postoperative outcomes and long-term pouch function. Eighty-one patients were identified. Original IPAA<ORGANIZATION> was performed for chronic ulcerative colitis ( n = 71 ; 88 % ) and indeterminate colitis ( n = 11 ; 12. % ), and the most common configuration was a J-pouch ( n = 69 ; 86 % ) with handsewn anastomosis ( n = 41 ; 68 % ). No independent predictors of 30-day postoperative complications following reconstructive/revisional surgery were identified. Pelvic<PERSON> abscesses and Crohn<PERSON> 's disease of the pouch were independently associated with ultimate pouch excision. Median<GPE> follow-up following revision/reconstruction was 40 months ( range, 1-292 months ) during which 15 patients ( 23 % ) had pouch failure. The 5- and 10-year pouch survival rates following revision were 85 ± 5 % and 65 ± 9 % by Kaplan-Meier estimation ; age < 30 years was significantly associated with pouch survival. Long-term function ( n = 30 ; 35 % ) compared with a matched control cohort of primary IPAA<ORGANIZATION> was characterized by significantly increased daytime bowel incontinence ( p = 0.0119 ), liquid stool ( p = 0.0062 ), and medication to thicken stools ( p = 0.0452 ). This was a single-center series, and response rate for functional data was 35 %. In properly selected patients with a failing pouch, originally made for chronic ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis, revisional and reconstructive surgery is associated with low complication rates, high pouch salvage, and acceptable long-term pouch function.
