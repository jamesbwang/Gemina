 Head<GPE> and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and alternative splicing is considered to play important roles in tumor progression. Our study is designed to identify alternative splicing events ( ASEs<ORGANIZATION> ) in HPV<ORGANIZATION> negative HNSCC<ORGANIZATION>. RNA sequencing data of 407 HPV negative HNSCC<ORGANIZATION> and 38 normal samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas<ORGANIZATION> ( TCGA<ORGANIZATION> ) and splice junctions were discovered using MapSplice<ORGANIZATION>. Outlier analysis was used to identify significant splicing junctions between HPV<ORGANIZATION> negative HNSCC<ORGANIZATION> and normal samples. To explore the functional role of the identified DOCK5<ORGANIZATION> variant, we checked its expression with qRT-PCR in a separate primary tumor validation set and performed proliferation, migration and invasion assays. 580 significant splicing events were identified in HPV<ORGANIZATION> negative HNSCC<ORGANIZATION> and the most common type of splicing events was an alternative start site ( 33.3 % ). The prevalence of a given individual ASE among the tumor cohort ranged from 9.8 % and 64.4 %. Within the 407 HPV negative HNSCC<ORGANIZATION> samples in TCGA<GPE>, the number of significant ASEs<ORGANIZATION> differentially expressed in each tumor ranged from 17 to 290. We identified a novel candidate oncogenic DOCK5<ORGANIZATION> variant confirmed using qRT-PCR in a separate primary tumor validation set. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments indicated that DOCK5<ORGANIZATION> variant promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of HPV<ORGANIZATION> negative HNSCC<ORGANIZATION> cells, and patients with higher expression of DOCK5<ORGANIZATION> variant showed decreased overall survival. Analysis of ASEs<ORGANIZATION> in HPV<ORGANIZATION> negative HNSCC<ORGANIZATION> identifies multiple alterations likely related to carcinogenesis, including an oncogenic DOCK5<ORGANIZATION> variant.
