 In 2008, the Centers<ORGANIZATION> for Medicare<ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid Services<ORGANIZATION> ( CMS<ORGANIZATION> ) stopped reimbursing for hospital-acquired conditions ( HACs<ORGANIZATION> ) not present on admission ( POA<ORGANIZATION> ). We sought to understand why this policy did not impact central line-associated bloodstream infection ( CLABSI<ORGANIZATION> ) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection ( CAUTI<ORGANIZATION> ) trends. Retrospective cohort study. Acute-care hospitals in the United<ORGANIZATION> States.ParticipantsFee-for-service Medicare patients discharged January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2011. Using inpatient Medicare<ORGANIZATION> claims data, we analyzed billing practices before and after the HAC<ORGANIZATION> policy was implemented, including the use and POA<ORGANIZATION> designation of codes for CLABSI<ORGANIZATION> or CAUTI<ORGANIZATION>. For the 3-year period following policy implementation, we determined the impact on diagnosis-related groups ( DRG<ORGANIZATION> ) determining reimbursement as well as hospital characteristics associated with the reimbursement impact. During the study period, 65,205,607 Medicare<ORGANIZATION> fee-for-service hospitalizations occurred at 3,291 acute-care, nonfederal US<ORGANIZATION> hospitals. Based on coding, CLABSI<ORGANIZATION> and CAUTI<ORGANIZATION> affected 0.23 % and 0.06 % of these hospitalizations, respectively. In addition, following the HAC<ORGANIZATION> policy, 82 % of the CLABSI<ORGANIZATION> codes and 91 % of the CAUTI<ORGANIZATION> codes were marked POA<ORGANIZATION>, which represented a large increase in the use of this designation. Finally, for the small numbers of CLABSI<ORGANIZATION> and CAUTI<ORGANIZATION> coded as not POA<ORGANIZATION>, financial impacts were detected on only 0.4 % of the hospitalizations with a CLABSI<ORGANIZATION> code and 5.7 % with a CAUTI<ORGANIZATION> code. Part of the reason the HAC<ORGANIZATION> policy did not have its intended impact is that billing codes for CLABSI<ORGANIZATION> and CAUTI<ORGANIZATION> were rarely used, were commonly listed as POA<ORGANIZATION> in the postpolicy period, and infrequently impacted hospital reimbursement.
