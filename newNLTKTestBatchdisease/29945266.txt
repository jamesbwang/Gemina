 Susceptibility<GPE> to Candida<GPE> spp. infection is largely determined by the status of host immunity, whether immunocompromised/immunodeficient or immunocompetent. Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ), a potent lymphoid cell growth factor, is a four-Î±-helix bundle cytokine induced by activated T cells with two important roles: the activation and maintenance of immune responses, and lymphocyte production and differentiation. We reviewed the roles of cytokines as immune stimulators and suppressors of Candida<GPE> spp. infections as an update on this continuously evolving field. We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central<ORGANIZATION> Register of Controlled Trials<ORGANIZATION>, Medline<GPE> ( PubMed<ORGANIZATION> ), and Embase<ORGANIZATION> databases for articles published from March 2010 to March 2016 using the following search terms: interleukins, interleukin-2, Candida<GPE> spp., and immunosuppression. Data from our own studies were also reviewed. Here, we provide an overview focusing on the ability of IL-2 to induce a large panel of trafficking receptors in skin inflammation and control T helper ( Th ) 2 cytokine production in response to contact with Candida<GPE> spp. Immunocompromised patients have reduced capacity to secrete Th1-related cytokines such as IL-2. The ability to secrete the Th1-related cytokine IL-2 is low in immunocompromised patients. This prevents an efficient Th1 immune response to Candida<GPE> spp. antigens, making immunocompromised patients more susceptible to candidal infections.
