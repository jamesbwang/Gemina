 Fine<GPE> particulate matter ( PM2.5 ), largely composed of secondary organic aerosol ( SOA<ORGANIZATION> ), is currently one of the most intractable environmental problems in China<GPE>. As crucial precursors for SOA<ORGANIZATION>, understanding the formation propensity of various volatile organic compound ( VOC<ORGANIZATION> ) species and sources is useful for pollution control. In this work, we estimated the SOA<ORGANIZATION> formation potential ( SOAP<ORGANIZATION> ) of anthropogenic VOC<ORGANIZATION> emissions based on an improved speciated VOC<ORGANIZATION> emission inventory, and investigated its distribution in China<GPE>. According to our estimates, toluene had the largest SOAP<ORGANIZATION>, followed by n-dodecane, m/p-xylene, styrene, n-decane, and n-undecane, while passenger cars, chemical fiber manufacturing, asphalt paving, and building coating were the top five SOAP-contributing sources nationwide. The spatial distribution of SOAP<ORGANIZATION> in China<GPE> shows a distinct pattern of high values in the southeast and low values in the northwest. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surroundings, the Yangtze River Delta<ORGANIZATION>, Pearl River Delta<PERSON>, and Sichuan-Chongqing District were found to have the highest SOAP<ORGANIZATION>, particularly in urban areas. The major SOAP-contributing species and sources differed among these regions, which was attributed to local industrial and energy structures. Our results suggest that to mitigate PM2.5 pollution in China<GPE>, more efficient SOAP-based control measures should be implemented instead of current emissions-based policies, and VOC<ORGANIZATION> control strategies should be adapted to local conditions.
