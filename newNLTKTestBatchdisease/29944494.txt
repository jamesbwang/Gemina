 To evaluate the complications and the treatment results of SmartPlug-related complications. Retrospective review of all patients from a single medical hospital who received SmartPlug<ORGANIZATION> ( Medennium<ORGANIZATION>, Inc., Irvine<GPE>, CA ) insertions from October 2007 to February 2014. All patients who developed SmartPlug-related canaliculitis and pyogenic granuloma were analyzed. Lacrimal irrigation with antibiotics was performed in most patients. Six hundred thirty-one eyes received SmartPlug<ORGANIZATION> insertion and 18 eyes developed SmartPlug-related complications ( 14 canaliculitis and 4 pyogenic granuloma ). The mean time interval from insertion to development of the complications is 3.0 ( 0.5-6.9 ) years. Sixteen eyes received lacrimal irrigation with antibiotics, and all the eyes showed improvement without recurrence. The other two eyes had recurrence of granuloma pyogenica only after surgical excision. SmartPlug-related complications, including canaliculitis and granuloma pyogenica, required long-term follow-up. Most of the complications can be cured by lacrimal irrigation of antibiotics.
