 Organs from deceased donors with suspected false-positive HIV screening tests were generally discarded due to the chance that the test was truly positive. However, the HIV Organ Policy Equity<ORGANIZATION> ( HOPE<ORGANIZATION> ) Act now facilitates use of such organs for transplant to HIV-infected ( HIV+ ) individuals. In the HOPE<ORGANIZATION> in Action<GPE> trial, donors without a known HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection who unexpectedly tested positive for anti-HIV antibody ( Ab ) or HIV<ORGANIZATION> nucleic acid test ( NAT<ORGANIZATION> ) were classified as suspected false-positive donors. Between<PERSON> 3/2016-3/2018, 10 suspected false-positive donors had organs recovered for transplant for 21 HIV+ recipients ( 14 single-kidney, 1 double-kidney, 5 liver, 1 simultaneous liver-kidney ). Median<GPE> donor age was 24 years ; cause of death was trauma ( n=5 ), stroke ( n=4 ) and anoxia ( n=1 ) ; three donors were labeled Public Health Services<PERSON> increased infectious risk. Median<GPE> kidney donor profile index was 30.5 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 22-58 ). Eight donors were HIV<ORGANIZATION> Ab+/NAT- ; two were HIV<ORGANIZATION> Ab-/NAT+. All 10 suspected false-positive donors were confirmed to be HIV-noninfected. Given the false-positive rates of approved assays used to screen > 20,000 deceased donors annually, we estimate 50-100 HIV false-positive donors per year.
