 Atopic<GPE> dermatitis ( AD ) is a common and chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting up to 20 % of children and 3 % of adults worldwide. Although previous reports including genome-wide association study ( GWAS<ORGANIZATION> ) approaches have identified several risk factors that appear to be associated with AD<ORGANIZATION> development, replication studies are lacking. In our current study, we replicated the associations between candidate susceptibility loci and AD<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 885 Korean<GPE> subjects ( 425 AD patients and 460 unaffected controls ) were genotyped for 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ) from previous GWASs<ORGANIZATION> and meta-analyses of AD<ORGANIZATION> and from immune-related genes. Several SNPs<ORGANIZATION> showed significant associations with AD<ORGANIZATION> in the case-control analysis ( minimum P=0.005 at rs17389644 ), suggesting that these polymorphisms may be related to this disease. In addition, several SNPs<ORGANIZATION> showed significant signals ( minimum P=0.004 at rs6473227 ) in severe AD compared to unaffected controls. In additional linear regression analysis, a few genotypes appeared to have potential effects on the SCORing<ORGANIZATION> AD ( SCORAD<ORGANIZATION> ) values ( minimum P=0.003 at rs13361382 on TMEM232<ORGANIZATION> ) and immunoglobulin E ( IgE<ORGANIZATION> ) levels ( minimum P < 0.0001 at rs4713555 near HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 ) in AD patients. Our replication and extended study provide additional supporting information on the genetic associations ( especially, variants in TMEM232<ORGANIZATION> and nearby to IL21<ORGANIZATION> and HLA-DRB1/HLA-DQA1 ) related to AD, its clinical severity and IgE<ORGANIZATION> involvement.
