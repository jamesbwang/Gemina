 We previously showed that nicotine evoked kinetic tremor by activating the inferior olive, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of essential tremor, via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Here, we evaluated the effects of various anti-tremor and anti-epileptic agents on nicotine-induced tremor in mice to clarify the pharmacological characteristics of nicotine tremor. Drugs<PERSON> effective for essential tremor, propranolol, diazepam and phenobarbital, all significantly inhibited kinetic tremor induced by an intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection of nicotine ( 1 mg/kg ). In contrast, none of the medications for Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease, l-DOPA, bromocriptine or trihexyphenidyl, affected the nicotine tremor. Among the anti-epileptic agents examined, valproate, carbamazepine and ethosuximide, significantly inhibited nicotine-induced tremor. In addition, a selective T-type Ca
