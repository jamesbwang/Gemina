 There is strong retrospective data demonstrating that BIMA<ORGANIZATION> grafting leads to better long-term survival as compared to LIMA<ORGANIZATION> grafting. However, this survival advantage was not corroborated by the interim results of the Arterial Revascularization Trial<ORGANIZATION> ( ART<ORGANIZATION> ). Today, there are barriers to widespread adoption of BIMA<ORGANIZATION> grafting. One of the main disadvantages of the use of BIMA<ORGANIZATION> grafts is the higher risk of DSWI<ORGANIZATION>. Deep<PERSON> sternal wound infections can be minimized by skeletonized harvesting of the IMA<ORGANIZATION> grafts, which preserves blood flow to the sternum. Also, utilizing the BIMA<ORGANIZATION> graft as a `` Y '' graft may lead to more complete revascularization compared to its in-situ use. BIMA grafting on average takes 25 minutes longer operating time with a higher in-hospital costs. We eagerly await the 10-year results of the ART<ORGANIZATION> trial to determine the truly unbiased randomized long-term effectiveness of BIMA<ORGANIZATION> grafting.
