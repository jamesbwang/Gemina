 Tissue<GPE> engineering-based regenerative applications can involve the use of stem cells for the treatment of non-healing wounds. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells have become a focus of skin injury treatments along with many other injury types owing to their unprecedented advantages. However, there are certain limitations concerning the solo use of stem cells in skin wound repair. Natural bioactive extracellular matrix-based scaffolds have great potential for overcoming these limitations by supporting the regenerative activity and localization of stem cells. This chapter describes the use of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells together with decellularized bovine small intestinal submucosa ( SIS<ORGANIZATION> ), for the treatment of a critical-sized full-thickness skin defect in a small animal model.
