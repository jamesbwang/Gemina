 The socio-economic burden of allergic respiratory conditions on continental Europe<GPE> is even higher than that of mainstream diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as allergic rhinitis alone accounts for billions of Euros<GPE> in healthcare expenses across Europe<GPE>. House<ORGANIZATION> dust mites ( HDM<ORGANIZATION> ) are one of the most common triggers behind allergic rhinitis and asthma. The role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of some allergic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, is already well recognized, whereas evidence about their efficacy in patients with respiratory allergies-while increasing-is still limited. Here the current evidence for the use of probiotics in patients with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma is discussed.
