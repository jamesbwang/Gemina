 Increasing evidence has suggested that bidirectional regulation of cell proliferation is one important effect of TGF-β1 in wound healing. Increased c-Ski expression plays a role in promoting fibroblast proliferation at low TGF-β1 concentrations, but the mechanism by which low TGF-β1 concentrations regulate c-Ski levels remains unclear. In this study, the proliferation of rat primary fibroblasts was assessed with an ELISA<ORGANIZATION> BrdU kit. The mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein expression and phosphorylation levels of corresponding factors were measured by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry or Western<GPE> blotting. We first found that low TGF-β1 concentrations not only promoted c-Ski mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein expression in rat primary fibroblasts but also increased the phosphorylation levels of Extracellular<GPE> Signal-Regulated Kinases<GPE> ( ERK<ORGANIZATION> ) and cAMP<ORGANIZATION> response element binding ( CREB<ORGANIZATION> ) protein. An ERK<ORGANIZATION> kinase ( mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MEK<ORGANIZATION> ) inhibitor significantly inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels, markedly reducing c-Ski expression and CREB<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation levels and abrogating the growth-promoting effect of low TGF-β1 concentrations. At the same time, Smad2/3 phosphorylation levels were not significantly changed. Taken together, these results suggest that the increased cell proliferation induced by low TGF-β1 concentrations mediates c-Ski expression potentially through the ERK/CREB pathway rather than through the classic TGF-β1/Smad pathway.
