 To assess the safety and efficacy of super-mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( SMP<ORGANIZATION> ) in the treatment of symptomatic lower pole renal stones ( LPSs<ORGANIZATION> ) after the failure of shockwave lithotripsy ( SWL<ORGANIZATION> ) or retrograde intrarenal surgery ( RIRS<ORGANIZATION> ), we retrospectively evaluated 44 patients with symptomatic LPSs<ORGANIZATION> with previously failed SWL<ORGANIZATION> or RIRS<ORGANIZATION> and consequently underwent SMP from October 2014 to March 2016. The percutaneous renal access was performed 12-14F with C-arm fluoroscopy or ultrasonographic guidance. Stone disintegration was performed using either Holmium<GPE> laser or pneumatic lithotripter. Perioperative parameters along with operations were assessed in detail. A total of 44 patients ( mean age 49.1 ± 13.7 years ) were included in the study. Stone size was 18.4 ± 6.0 mm ( range 9-29 ), operative time was 63.9 ± 32.7 min ( range 14-145 ) and hospital stay was 2.8 ± 1.2 days ( range 1-5 ). The hemoglobin drop was 12.4 ± 8.8 g/L ( range 0-31 ), and no patients required blood transfusion. Complete stone-free status was achieved in 40 ( 90.9 % ) patients. Clinically<PERSON> insignificant residual fragments were observed in three ( 6.8 % ) patients and only one ( 2.3 % ) patient had a 6 mm residual calculus. A total of three minor complications ( urinary tract infection, hemorrhage resolved by hemostatics and renal colic requiring analgesics ) were observed postoperatively. For symptomatic LPSs<ORGANIZATION> after the failure of SWL<ORGANIZATION> or RIRS<ORGANIZATION>, SMP<ORGANIZATION> is a safe and efficient auxiliary option and even might be an alternative to SWL<ORGANIZATION> or RIRS<ORGANIZATION>, while further considering the stone-free rates and stone-related events.
