 Surgical-site infections ( SSIs<ORGANIZATION> ) increase the length of hospital admission and costs. SSI<ORGANIZATION> prevention guidelines include preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. This review assessed the reporting quality and cost-effectiveness of preoperative antibiotics used to prevent SSI<ORGANIZATION>. PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Web of Science<GPE>, Cumulative Index<PERSON> to Nursing<GPE> and Allied Health Literature<PERSON>, Index<GPE> of Economic Articles<ORGANIZATION> ( EconLit<ORGANIZATION> ), Database<ORGANIZATION> of Abstracts<ORGANIZATION> of Reviews of Effect<GPE> ( including the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database<ORGANIZATION> ) and Cochrane Central<ORGANIZATION> databases were searched systematically from 1970 to 2017 for articles that included costs, preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis and SSI<ORGANIZATION>. Included were RCTs<ORGANIZATION> and quasi-experimental studies conducted in Organisation<GPE> for Economic<ORGANIZATION> Co-operation and Development<ORGANIZATION> countries with participants aged at least 18 years and published in English<GPE>. Two reviewers assessed eligibility, with inter-rater reliability determined by Cohen<PERSON> 's κ statistic. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation<ORGANIZATION> and Reporting Standards ( CHEERS<ORGANIZATION> ) and modified Drummond<ORGANIZATION> checklists were used to assess reporting and economic quality. Study outcomes and characteristics were extracted, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, with costs adjusted to euros ( 2016 ) ( €1 = US<ORGANIZATION> $ 1·25 ; £1 sterling = €1·28 ). Twelve studies published between 1988 and 2014 were included from 646 records identified ; nine were RCTs<ORGANIZATION>, two were nested within RCTs<ORGANIZATION> and one was a retrospective chart review. Study<PERSON> quality was highest in the nested studies. Cephalosporins ( first, second and third generation ) were the most frequent prophylactic interventions. Eleven studies demonstrated clinically effective interventions ; ten were cost-effective ( the intervention was dominant ) ; in one the intervention was dominated by the control ; and in one the intervention was more effective and more expensive than the control. Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis does reduce SSI<ORGANIZATION>, costs to hospitals and health providers, but the reporting of economic methods in RCTs<ORGANIZATION> is not standardized. Routinely nesting economic methods in RCTs<ORGANIZATION> would improve economic evaluations and ensure appropriate selection of prophylactic antibiotics.
