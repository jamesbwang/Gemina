 We provide advances in DCL<ORGANIZATION> and RDR<ORGANIZATION> gene diversity in Solanaceae<GPE>. We also shed light on DCL<ORGANIZATION> and RDR<ORGANIZATION> gene expression in response to cold stress. DICER-like ( DCL<ORGANIZATION> ) and RNA-dependent RNA<ORGANIZATION> polymerase ( RDR<ORGANIZATION> ) genes form the core components to trigger small non-coding RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( ncRNA<ORGANIZATION> ) production. In spite of this, little is known about the two gene families in non-model plant species. As their genome sequences are now available, the cultivated potato ( Solanum<ORGANIZATION> tuberosum ) and its cold-tolerant wild relative Solanum commersonii offer a valuable opportunity to advance our understanding of the above genes. To determine the extent of diversification and evolution of DCLs<ORGANIZATION> and RDRs<ORGANIZATION> in these species, we performed a comparative analysis. Seven DCLs<PERSON> were identified in the two species, whereas seven and six RDR genes were found in S. tuberosum and S. commersonii, respectively. Based on phylogenetic analysis with DCLs<ORGANIZATION> and RDRs<ORGANIZATION> from several species, we provide evidence for an increase in their number in both potato species. We also disclosed that tandem duplications played a major role in the evolution of these gene families in Solanaceae<GPE>. DCL<ORGANIZATION> and RDR<ORGANIZATION> expression was investigated in different tissues and under cold and virus stresses, with divergent profiles of the tandem duplicated genes being found in different tissues. DCL<ORGANIZATION> paralogs showed a contrasting expression in S. tuberosum and S. commersonii following cold stress and virus infection. By contrast, no change in RDR<ORGANIZATION> transcript activity was detected following both stresses. Overall, this study provides the first comparative genomic analysis of the core components of the RNAi<ORGANIZATION> machinery in Solanaceae<GPE> and offers a scaffold for future functional analysis of these gene families.
