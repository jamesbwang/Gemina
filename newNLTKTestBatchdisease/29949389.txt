 - Anticyclic<PERSON> citrullinated peptide antibodies are important serologic markers for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Several kinds of test reagents for automated immunoassay systems have been developed and used in recent years. - To evaluate the analytic and diagnostic performance of the new ADVIA Centaur<ORGANIZATION> anticyclic citrullinated peptide assay ( Siemens Healthineers<ORGANIZATION>, Erlangen<PERSON>, Germany<GPE> ) compared with the Elecsys<ORGANIZATION> assay ( Roche Diagnostics<PERSON>, Mannheim<GPE>, Germany<GPE> ). - A total of 576 serum samples were collected from subjects, including 156 patients ( 27 % ) with rheumatoid arthritis. Precision performance and analytical measurement range for the ADVIA<ORGANIZATION> assay were evaluated. Diagnostic<PERSON> performance of the 2 assays was compared based on sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. - The ADVIA<ORGANIZATION> assay showed a within-laboratory imprecision of 3.4 % coefficient of variation for levels of 3.36 and 24.99 U/mL. This assay was demonstrated to be linear from 0.4 to 180.0 U/mL. With default cutoff values, sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis were 71.2 % and 97.9 %, respectively, for the ADVIA<ORGANIZATION> assay and 73.1 % and 96.9 %, respectively, for the Elecsys<ORGANIZATION> assay. With the best cutoff values from the analyses of the receiver operating characteristic curve, the sensitivity of the 2 assays was the same at 75.6 %. However, the specificity of the ADVIA<ORGANIZATION> assay was 96.4 %, whereas that of the Elecsys<ORGANIZATION> assay was 94.3 %. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value for the ADVIA<ORGANIZATION> assay was 0.867, which was not significantly different from that of the Elecsys<ORGANIZATION> assay ( 0.865 ). - The ADVIA Centaur<ORGANIZATION> anticyclic citrullinated peptide assay showed good analytic and diagnostic performance in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis.
