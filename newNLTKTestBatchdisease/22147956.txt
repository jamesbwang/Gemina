 Thyroid<GPE> diseases, including autoimmune thyroid diseases and thyroid cancer, are known to have high heritability. Family<PERSON> and twin studies have indicated that genetics plays a major role in the development of thyroid diseases. Thyroid<PERSON> function, represented by thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH<ORGANIZATION> ) and free thyroxine ( T4 ), is also known to be partly genetically determined. Before the era of genome-wide association studies ( GWAS<ORGANIZATION> ), the ability to identify genes responsible for susceptibility to thyroid disease was limited. Over the past decade, GWAS<ORGANIZATION> have been used to identify genes involved in many complex diseases, including various phenotypes of the thyroid gland. In GWAS<ORGANIZATION> of autoimmune thyroid diseases, many susceptibility loci associated with autoimmunity ( human leukocyte antigen [ HLA ], protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 [ PTPN22<ORGANIZATION> ], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 [ CTLA4<ORGANIZATION> ], and interleukin 2 receptor subunit alpha [ IL2RA ] ) or thyroid-specific genes ( thyroid stimulating hormone receptor [ TSHR ] and forkhead box E1 [ FOXE1 ] ) have been identified. Regarding thyroid function, many susceptibility loci for levels of TSH<ORGANIZATION> and free T4 have been identified through genome-wide analyses. In GWAS<ORGANIZATION> of differentiated thyroid cancer, associations at FOXE1<ORGANIZATION>, MAP3K12<ORGANIZATION> binding inhibitory protein 1 ( MBIP<ORGANIZATION> ) -NK2 homeobox 1 ( NKX2-1 ), disrupted in renal carcinoma 3 ( DIRC3<ORGANIZATION> ), neuregulin 1 ( NRG1<ORGANIZATION> ), and pecanex-like 2 ( PCNXL2<ORGANIZATION> ) have been commonly identified in people of European<GPE> and Korean<GPE> ancestry, and many other susceptibility loci have been found in specific populations. Through GWAS<ORGANIZATION> of various thyroid-related phenotypes, many susceptibility loci have been found, providing insights into the pathogenesis of thyroid diseases and disease co-clustering within families and individuals.
