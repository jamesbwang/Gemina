 Leptospirosis<GPE> is an important global public health problem. Favourable environmental factors are influencing the survival of leptospires in soil, which is an important link in the transmission cycle. The present study was designed to understand the correlation between various soil nutrients and presence of Leptospira<ORGANIZATION> in soil samples of different regions of Andaman<PERSON> and Nicobar Islands<PERSON>. The study revealed a significant positive relationship between presence of Leptospira<ORGANIZATION> and concentration of iron, manganese and copper in soil. Presence of iron, manganese and copper in the soil may influence the survival and transmission of leptospirosis.
