 FoxM1<ORGANIZATION> plays important regulatory roles in a variety of diseases. However, the functional role of FoxM1<ORGANIZATION> and mechanisms responsible for its expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST<ORGANIZATION> ) is not thoroughly understood. FoxM1 protein expression and biological function were examined in human GIST<ORGANIZATION> tissues and cells using immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION>, western blot, CCK-8, wound-healing- and Matrigel<GPE> invasion assays, respectively. The role of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF<ORGANIZATION> ) signaling in FoxM1<GPE> expression was investigated using chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter and in vivo tumor growth assays. FoxM1<PERSON> was highly expressed in highly proliferative and migratory/invasive GIST<ORGANIZATION> specimens. Upregulation of FoxM1<ORGANIZATION> was positively correlated with the expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in GIST<ORGANIZATION> specimens, and hypoxia-induced FoxM1<ORGANIZATION> expression in GIST<ORGANIZATION> cells. Functionally, ectopic expression of FoxM1<ORGANIZATION> significantly promoted GIST<ORGANIZATION> cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration and invasion, whereas the knockdown of endogenous FoxM1<ORGANIZATION> of hypoxic GIST<ORGANIZATION> cells had the opposite effects. Molecularly, FoxM1<PERSON> was transcriptionally regulated by HIF-2α under normoxia, whereas it was upregulated by both HIF-1α and HIF-2α under hypoxia. The xenograft tumor data further confirmed the regulated effect of HIF-1α and HIF-2α on FoxM1<ORGANIZATION>, and demonstrated that the simultaneous downregulation of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α inhibited GIST<ORGANIZATION> tumor growth. Our data demonstrated the critical role of FoxM1<ORGANIZATION> in promoting GIST<ORGANIZATION> progression and uncovered a novel HIF-1α/HIF-2α-FoxM1 axis. These findings identify FoxM1<ORGANIZATION> as a possible new molecular target for designing novel therapeutic treatments to control GIST<ORGANIZATION> progression.
