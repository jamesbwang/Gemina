 Stem-cell-derived organoids recapitulate in vivo physiology of their original tissues, representing valuable systems to model medical disorders such as infectious diseases. Cryptosporidium<PERSON>, a protozoan parasite, is a leading cause of diarrhoea and a major cause of child mortality worldwide. Drug<PERSON> development requires detailed knowledge of the pathophysiology of Cryptosporidium<GPE>, but experimental approaches have been hindered by the lack of an optimal in vitro culture system. Here, we show that Cryptosporidium<PERSON> can infect epithelial organoids derived from human small intestine and lung. The parasite propagates within the organoids and completes its complex life cycle. Temporal analysis of the Cryptosporidium<ORGANIZATION> transcriptome during organoid infection reveals dynamic regulation of transcripts related to its life cycle. Our study presents organoids as a physiologically relevant in vitro model system to study Cryptosporidium<GPE> infection.
