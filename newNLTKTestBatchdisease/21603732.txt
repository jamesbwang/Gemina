 One complication of an autogenous arteriovenous fistula ( AVF<ORGANIZATION> ) for hemodialysis is the formation of a venous aneurysm. The treatment of a massive aneurysmal AVF<ORGANIZATION> generally involves ligation or resection with the use of prosthetic interposition. We present the case of a 46-year-old man in whom an AVF<ORGANIZATION> aneurysm was successfully treated by placating the excess free wall of the aneurysm with sutures. This method is a simple and effective intervention for managing aneurysm-associated complications. In addition, this approach helps to maintain the benefits of autogenous access while conserving future dialysis sites.
