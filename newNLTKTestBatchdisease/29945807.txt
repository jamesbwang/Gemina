 Intramural hematomas ( IMHs<ORGANIZATION> ) are reported to dynamically evolve into different clinical outcomes ranging from regression to aortic rupture, but no practice guidelines are available in China<GPE>. To determine the evolution of IMHs<ORGANIZATION> after long-term follow-up and to identify the predictive factors of IMH<ORGANIZATION> outcomes in the Chinese<GPE> population. A total of 123 IMH patients with clinical and imaging follow-up data were retrospectively studied. The primary endpoints were aortic disease-related death, aortic dissection, penetrating aortic ulcer ( PAU<ORGANIZATION> ), thickening of the aortic hematoma and aortic complications requiring surgical or endovascular treatment. All 123 IMH patients were monitored clinically. The follow-up duration ranged from 1.4 to 107 months ( median, 20 months ). Thirty-nine patients had type A IMH, and 84 had type B. The multivariate analysis showed that a baseline MAD<ORGANIZATION> â‰¥ 44.75 mm ( 2.9 % vs 61.4 %, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) and acute PAUs<ORGANIZATION> ( 2.9 % vs 34.1 %, P<PERSON> = 0.008 ) were independent predictors of aorta-related events. Medication and short-term imaging are recommended for Chinese<GSP> IMH<ORGANIZATION> patients with a hematoma thickness < 10.45 mm and a baseline MAD<ORGANIZATION> < 44.75 mm. Rigorous medical observation should also be performed during the acute phase of IMH<ORGANIZATION>.
