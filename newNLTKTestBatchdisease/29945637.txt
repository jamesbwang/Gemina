 The incidence of abnormal cervical smears in the United Arab Emirates<ORGANIZATION> ( UAE<ORGANIZATION> ) is 3.6 %. Data regarding specific high-risk HPV<ORGANIZATION> ( hrHPV<ORGANIZATION> ) genotypes are insufficient. Identification of hrHPV<ORGANIZATION> subtypes is essential to allow formulating effective vaccination strategies. A total of 75 archival cervical cone biopsies with HSIL<ORGANIZATION> or higher lesions ( 2012-2016 ) were retrieved from a tertiary hospital, including HSIL<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 70 ), adenocarcinoma in-situ ( n = 1 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( n = 4 ). Five tissue sections ( 10-Î¼-thick each ) were cut and DNA<ORGANIZATION> extracted using the QIAamp<ORGANIZATION> DNA FFPE Tissue Kit<PERSON>. GenomeMeTM<ORGANIZATION> 's GeneNavTM<ORGANIZATION> HPV One qPCR Kit<PERSON> was used for specific detection of HPV<ORGANIZATION> 16 and 18 ; and non-16/18 samples were typed by GenomeMeTM<ORGANIZATION> 's GeneNavTM<ORGANIZATION> HPV Genotyping qPCR Kit. Median<GPE> age was 34 years ( range 19-58 ) with 70 % UAE Nationals<ORGANIZATION>. hrHPV<ORGANIZATION> detected were 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59, 66 & 68. hrHPV testing was negative in 12 % of cases. Most common types were HPV<ORGANIZATION> 16 ( 49 % ), HPV 31 ( 20 % ) and HPV 18 ( 6.6 % ). hrHPV 16 and/or 18 represented 56 % and rare subtypes 32 %. Co-infection was present in 16 %. Eight cases had two-viral subtype infections and 4 cases had 3 subtype infections. Multi-viral HPV<ORGANIZATION> infection was limited to hrHPV 16, 18, 31 & 33 subtypes. Infection by non HPV 16/18 is fairly common. A higher than expected incidence of rare subtype ( 20 % hrHPV31<ORGANIZATION> ) and multi-viral hrHPV ( 16 % ) were detected. This finding stresses the importance of this pilot study as currently only quadravalent vaccine is offered to control the HPV<ORGANIZATION> infection in the UAE<ORGANIZATION> population.
