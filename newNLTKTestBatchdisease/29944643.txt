 Syphilis<GSP> is a cause of morbidity and mortality and is of particular concern in pregnancy in low income countries because of risks associated with maternal-fetal transmission. Ugandan<PERSON> national guidelines recommend a non-treponemal Rapid Plasma Reagin<PERSON> ( RPR<ORGANIZATION> ) followed by treponemal testing for diagnosis of syphilis. The RPR<ORGANIZATION> test confirms a reactive specific treponemal test, or confirms serological 'cure ' with a 4-fold dilutional decrease ; RPR<ORGANIZATION> is beset with technical and biological limitations making accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment problematic. The aim of this analysis was to compare performance of RPR-testing in different laboratories. Stored<PERSON>, freeze-thawed sera from 215 participants were additionally tested for RPR<ORGANIZATION> and dilutional titer in two different reference laboratories. Discrepant results were tested at a third reference lab which served as a tie-breaker. Equivalence in RPR<ORGANIZATION> titer was defined as within â‰¤2 fold. All patients with a reactive rapid tests were treated as per Ugandan<GPE> national guidelines. Of 215 sera, 97 ( 45.1 % ) were RPR<ORGANIZATION> reactive in clinic laboratory A, 81 ( 37.7 % ) and 65 ( 30.2 % ) were RPR<ORGANIZATION> reactive in labs B and C respectively. All reported positive in the lab C were positive in lab B. Discrepant results were tested in lab D. Chi square test was highly significant ( P<PERSON> = < 0.001 ) for difference between each dyad of labs ( A & B, A & C and B & C ) RPR<ORGANIZATION> results. There were significant differences between RPR<ORGANIZATION> titers by paired t-test and Wilcox<PERSON> rank test ( P<PERSON> = < 0.001 ) ; with up to a 3-fold difference between labs. Two one-sided test approach demonstrated non-equivalence. Agreement between labs B-D, and C-D: 48/49 ( 98.0 % ) and 35/49 ( 71.4 % ) respectively ( P<PERSON> = < 0.001 ). Labs B<PERSON> and D<PERSON> showed no significant difference and had equivalent RPR<ORGANIZATION> titers. Labs C<PERSON> and D<PERSON> had different titers ( P<PERSON> = < 0.001 ) and were not equivalent. We found significant inter- laboratory discrepant RPR<ORGANIZATION> results. It is likely that a 3-fold difference in results is likely to be clinically significant and could result in under- or over-treatment. These data demonstrate a key limitation of the RPR<ORGANIZATION> test and underline the urgent need for a more reproducible quantitative test than the current RPR<ORGANIZATION> for diagnosing and determining cure of syphilis.
