 Guanosine<GPE> triphosphate cyclohydrolase I ( GCH1<ORGANIZATION> ) mutations are associated with increased risk for dopa-responsive dystonia ( DRD<ORGANIZATION> ) and Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease ( PD ). Herein<PERSON>, we investigated the frequency of GCH1<ORGANIZATION> mutations and clinical symptoms in patients with clinically diagnosed PD<ORGANIZATION> and DRD<ORGANIZATION>. We used the Sanger<GPE> method to screen entire exons in 268 patients with PD<ORGANIZATION> and 26 patients with DRD<ORGANIZATION>, with the examinations of brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, striatal dopamine transporter scans, and [
