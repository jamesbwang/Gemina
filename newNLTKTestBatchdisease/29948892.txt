 The usage of left-ventricular-assist device ( LVAD<ORGANIZATION> ) is increasing in patients presenting with advanced heart failure. However, device-related infections are a challenge to recognize and to treat, with an important morbidity and mortality rate. The role of nuclear medicine imaging remains not well established for LVAD<ORGANIZATION> infections. The present study compared the accuracy of positron emission tomography/computed tomography with From a prospectively maintained database, we retrospectively analyzed the diagnostic performance of radiolabeled leucocyte scintigraphy and Twenty-four patients were included: 15 had a specific VAD<ORGANIZATION> infection ( 5 cardiac-LVAD and 10 driveline ), 6 had a VAD-related infection, while 3 patients had a non-VAD-related infection. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 95.2 %, 66.7 %, 95.2 %, 66.7 %, and 91.6 %, respectively, for None
