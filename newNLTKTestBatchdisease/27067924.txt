 To determine the efficacy of real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION> for the diagnosis and prognosis of varicella-zoster virus ( VZV<ORGANIZATION> ) keratitis. Retrospective case series. Patients: 545 consecutive patients with keratitis were examined to quantify copy numbers of VZV<ORGANIZATION> DNA by real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION>. Association of copy numbers of VZV<ORGANIZATION> DNA to clinical signs and disease course was assessed by logistic regression analysis and Cox<PERSON> proportional hazard model. Of the 545 eyes, 38 ( 6.9 % ) were diagnosed as VZV<ORGANIZATION> keratitis. The median copy number of the VZV<ORGANIZATION> DNA was 10 Higher VZV<ORGANIZATION> DNA copy numbers are associated with the refractoriness of VZV<ORGANIZATION> keratitis, and its evaluation may be a useful way to clinically diagnose and manage VZV<ORGANIZATION> keratitis.
