 Inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase ( Syk ) is a promising strategy for the treatment of various allergic and autoimmune disorders such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergic rhinitis. Previously, a Syk inhibitor with novel indazole scaffold was discovered by structure-based virtual screening. Herein<PERSON>, the structure-activity relationship of the indazole Syk inhibitors was investigated. Several new inhibitors demonstrated potent activity against Syk<PERSON>. In particular, compound 18c showed good Syk inhibitory activity ( IC<ORGANIZATION>
