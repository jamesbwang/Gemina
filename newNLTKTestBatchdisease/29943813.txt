 The proteolytic autophagy pathway is enhanced in the lower limb muscles of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ). Reactive oxygen species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ) have been shown to regulate autophagy in the skeletal muscles, but the role of oxidative stress in the muscle autophagy of patients with COPD<ORGANIZATION> is unknown. We used cultured myoblasts and myotubes from the quadriceps of eight healthy subjects and twelve patients with COPD<ORGANIZATION> ( FEV1<ORGANIZATION> % predicted: 102.0 % and 32.0 %, respectively ; p < 0.0001 ). We compared the autophagosome formation, the expression of autophagy markers, and the autophagic flux in healthy subjects and the patients with COPD<ORGANIZATION>, and we evaluated the effects of the 3-methyladenine ( 3-MA ) autophagy inhibitor on the atrophy of COPD<ORGANIZATION> myotubes. Autophagy<PERSON> was also assessed in COPD<ORGANIZATION> myotubes treated with an antioxidant molecule, ascorbic acid. Autophagosome formation was increased in COPD<ORGANIZATION> myoblasts and myotubes ( p = 0.011 ; p < 0.001 ), and the LC3<ORGANIZATION> 2/LC3 1 ratio ( p = 0.002 ), SQSTM1<ORGANIZATION> mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein expression ( p = 0.023 ; p = 0.007 ), BNIP3<ORGANIZATION> expression ( p = 0.031 ), and autophagic flux ( p = 0.002 ) were higher in COPD<ORGANIZATION> myoblasts. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA increased the COPD<ORGANIZATION> myotube diameter ( p < 0.001 ) to a level similar to the diameter of healthy subject myotubes. Treatment of COPD<ORGANIZATION> myotubes with ascorbic acid decreased ROS<ORGANIZATION> concentration ( p < 0.001 ), ROS-induced protein carbonylation ( p = 0.019 ), the LC3<ORGANIZATION> 2/LC3 1 ratio ( p = 0.037 ), the expression of SQSTM1<GPE> ( p < 0.001 ) and BNIP3<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.001 ), and increased the COPD<ORGANIZATION> myotube diameter ( p < 0.001 ). Thus, autophagy signaling is enhanced in cultured COPD<ORGANIZATION> muscle cells. Furthermore, the oxidative stress level contributes to the regulation of autophagy, which is involved in the atrophy of COPD<ORGANIZATION> myotubes in vitro.
