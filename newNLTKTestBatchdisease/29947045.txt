 To replicate the well-established association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus beta blockers and angioedema in the International Classification<ORGANIZATION> of Diseases<GPE>, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification<PERSON> ( ICD-10-CM ) era. We conducted a retrospective, inception cohort study in a large insurance database formatted to the Sentinel Common Data Model<ORGANIZATION>. We defined study periods spanning the ICD-9-CM era only, ICD-10-CM era only, and ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM era and conducted simple-forward mapping ( SFM<ORGANIZATION> ), simple-backward mapping ( SBM<ORGANIZATION> ), and forward-backward mapping ( FBM<ORGANIZATION> ) referencing the General Equivalence Mappings<ORGANIZATION> to translate the outcome ( angioedema ) and covariates from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. We performed propensity score ( PS ) -matched and PS-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios ( HRs<ORGANIZATION> ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs<ORGANIZATION> ). In the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras spanning April 1 to September 30 of 2015 and 2016, there were 152 017 and 145 232 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor initiators and 115 073 and 116 652 beta-blocker initiators, respectively. The PS-matched HR was 4.19 ( 95 % CI, 2.82-6.23 ) in the ICD-9-CM era, 4.37 ( 2.92-6.52 ) in the ICD-10-CM era using SFM<ORGANIZATION>, and 4.64 ( 3.05-7.07 ) in the ICD-10-CM era using SBM<ORGANIZATION> and FBM<ORGANIZATION>. The PS-matched HRs from the mixed ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras ranged from 3.91 ( 2.69-5.68 ) to 4.35 ( 3.33-5.70 ). The adjusted HRs<ORGANIZATION> across different diagnostic coding eras and the use of SFM<ORGANIZATION> versus SBM<ORGANIZATION> and FBM<ORGANIZATION> produced numerically different but clinically similar results. Additional investigations as ICD-10-CM data accumulate are warranted.
