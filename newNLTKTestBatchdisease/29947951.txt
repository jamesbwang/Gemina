 The RING-type E3 ligase AtARRE<ORGANIZATION> participates in the plant ABA responding as a negative regulator. Ubiquitination protease system ( UPS<ORGANIZATION> ) is significant in post-transcriptional regulation. In UPS<ORGANIZATION>, E3<GPE> ligase recognizes the substrate protein and mediates the polyubiquitin chain onto the substrate. Here, we identified a new gene, named Arabidopsis<PERSON> thaliana ABA-related RING-type E3 ligase ( AtARRE<ORGANIZATION> ), which induced by ABA<ORGANIZATION> and NaCl<ORGANIZATION>. AtARRE<ORGANIZATION> encodes a functional RING-type E3 ligase protein localized in nucleus and plasma membrane of Arabidopsis<GPE>. Physiological analysis demonstrated that mutation of AtARRE<GPE> ( T-DNA insert mutants atarre-1 and atarre-2 ) caused plants hypersensitivity to ABA<ORGANIZATION>, including enhanced stomatal closure, reduced root elongation and seed germination. However, overexpression of AtARRE<ORGANIZATION> transgenic lines caused plants hyposensitive to ABA<ORGANIZATION> compared with WT<ORGANIZATION> and mutant atarre plants. Under the treatment of ABA<ORGANIZATION>, the transcript abundances of ABA-responsive genes RD29A<ORGANIZATION>, RD29B<ORGANIZATION>, RD22<ORGANIZATION> and ABI5<ORGANIZATION> in atarre mutant plants were markedly higher than those of WT<ORGANIZATION> and AtARRE<ORGANIZATION> overexpression lines. Hence<PERSON>, these results indicate that AtARRE<ORGANIZATION> acts as a negative regulator of ABA-mediated stress responses in Arabidopsis<GPE>.
