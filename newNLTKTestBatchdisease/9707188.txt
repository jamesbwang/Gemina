 Intracranial aneurysms manifest in a vast variety of morphologies and their growth and rupture risk are subject to patient-specific conditions that are coupled with complex, non-linear effects of hemodynamics. Thus, studies that attempt to understand and correlate rupture risk to aneurysm morphology have to incorporate hemodynamics, and at the same time, address a large enough sample size so as to produce reliable statistical correlations. In order to perform accurate hemodynamic simulations for a large number of aneurysm cases, automated methods to convert medical imaging data to simulation-ready configuration with minimal ( or no ) human intervention are required. In the present study, we develop a highly-automated method based on the immersed boundary method framework to construct computational models from medical imaging data which is the key idea is the direct use of voxelized contrast information from the 3D angiograms to construct a level-set based computational `` mask '' for the hemodynamic simulation. Appropriate boundary conditions are provided to the mask and the dynamics of blood flow inside the vessels and aneurysm is simulated by solving the Navier-Stokes equations on the Cartesian<GPE> grid using the sharp-interface immersed boundary method. The present method does not require body conformal surface/volume mesh generation or other intervention for model clean-up. The viability of the proposed method is demonstrated for a number of distinct aneurysms derived from actual, patient-specific data.
