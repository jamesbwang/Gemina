 Genetic<GPE> predisposition to systemic sclerosis ( SSc<ORGANIZATION> ) has still not been fully revealed. Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) is a mediator of T cell proliferation and fibrotic events in SSc<ORGANIZATION>. Polymorphisms in the IL-6 are found to be important in susceptibility to development of SSc<ORGANIZATION>. We aimed to assess the frequency of -174 C/G of IL-6 gene polymorphism in SSc<ORGANIZATION> patients and healthy controls, as well as correlation with disease manifestations. In the case-control study, 102 patients with SSc<ORGANIZATION> and 93 controls were included. PCR-RFLP method was performed for genotyping promotor variants -174 C/G of IL-6 gene. The expression level of IL-6 was determined by qRT-PCR on subset of 50 patients and 13 healthy controls with different IL-6 genotypes. We used UCLA<ORGANIZATION> GIT 2.0 questionnaire to assess gastrointestinal involvement in SSc<ORGANIZATION> patients. The expression level of IL-6 gene was significantly higher in patients with SSc<ORGANIZATION> in comparison with healthy controls ( p < 0.05 ). Carriers of C-allele of IL-6 gene compared to those with G allele, showed higher expression of IL-6 gene ( 95.8 vs. 41.2, p < 0.05 ), higher GIT total score ( 0.85 vs. 0.5, p < 0.05 ) and higher distension scale score ( 1.4 ± 0.9 vs. 0.78 ± 0.8, p = 0.05 ). No significant differences in genotype distribution and allele frequency were observed between patients and controls. The expression of IL6<ORGANIZATION> gene varies significantly during the course of SSc<ORGANIZATION>. The IL-6 gene variant -174 C/G ( presence of C-allele ) is associated with higher IL-6 gene expression and greater GIT impairment in patients with SSc<ORGANIZATION>.
