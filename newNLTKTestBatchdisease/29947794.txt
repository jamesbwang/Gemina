 CRISPR/Cas9 is an attractive platform to potentially correct dominant genetic diseases by gene editing with unprecedented precision. In the current proof-of-principle study, we explored the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene-editing in myotonic dystrophy type-1 ( DM1<ORGANIZATION> ), an autosomal-dominant muscle disorder, by excising the CTG-repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated-region ( UTR<ORGANIZATION> ) of the human myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( DMPK<ORGANIZATION> ) gene in DM1<ORGANIZATION> patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells ( DM1-iPSC ), DM1-iPSC-derived myogenic cells and DM1<ORGANIZATION> patient-specific myoblasts. To eliminate the pathogenic gain-of-function mutant DMPK<ORGANIZATION> transcript, we designed a dual guide RNA<ORGANIZATION> based strategy that excises the CTG-repeat expansion with high efficiency, as confirmed by Southern<GPE> blot and single molecule real-time ( SMRT<ORGANIZATION> ) sequencing. Correction<ORGANIZATION> efficiencies up to 90 % could be attained in DM1-iPSC as confirmed at the clonal level, following ribonucleoprotein ( RNP<ORGANIZATION> ) transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 components without the need for selective enrichment. Expanded CTG<ORGANIZATION> repeat excision resulted in the disappearance of ribonuclear foci, a quintessential cellular phenotype of DM1<ORGANIZATION>, in the corrected DM1-iPSC, DM1-iPSC-derived myogenic cells and DM1<ORGANIZATION> myoblasts. Consequently, the normal intracellular localization of the muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1 ( MBNL1<ORGANIZATION> ) was restored, resulting in the normalization of splicing pattern of SERCA1<GPE>. This study validates the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing of repeat expansions.
