 Previous studies have reported the prognostic value of objective nutritional indices such as the Controlling Nutritional Status ( CONUT<ORGANIZATION> ) score, Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index<PERSON> ( GNRI<ORGANIZATION> ) and Prognostic Nutritional Index<ORGANIZATION> ( PNI<ORGANIZATION> ). However, the effects of these indices in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD<ORGANIZATION> ) who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI<ORGANIZATION> ) remain unclear. Furthermore, there are insufficient data to combine these indices. A total of 1984 patients who underwent elective PCI were enrolled. The Combined Objective Nutritional Score<ORGANIZATION> was determined by assigning 1 point each for high CONUT<ORGANIZATION> score ( 3-12 ), low GNRI<ORGANIZATION> ( < 98 ) or low PNI<ORGANIZATION> ( < 45 ). Patients were grouped into normal nutritional status ( 0 points ), mild-to-moderate malnutrition ( 1-2 points ) and severe malnutrition ( 3 points ). Incidences of all-cause death and cardiac death were evaluated. Among the 1984 patients, 514 ( 25.9 % ) and 244 ( 12.3 % ) had mild-to-moderate and severe malnutrition, respectively. During follow-up ( median 7.4 years ), 293 all-cause deaths were identified, including 92 cardiac deaths. Kaplan-Meier curves showed ongoing divergence in rates of death among nutritional statuses determined by the novel score ( log rank test, p < 0.0001 ). Multivariate Cox hazard analysis showed that patients with a Combined Objective Nutritional Score<ORGANIZATION> of 3 showed 2.91-fold ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 2.10-4.00 ; p < 0.0001 ) and 2.16-fold ( 95 % CI 1.15-3.92 ; p = 0.02 ) increases in risk of mortality and cardiac mortality compared with patients with a Combined Objective Nutritional Score<ORGANIZATION> of 0. In conclusion, malnutrition as evaluated by the Combined<ORGANIZATION> Objective Nutritional Score<PERSON> was significantly associated with worse long-term cardiovascular outcomes among CAD<ORGANIZATION> patients who underwent PCI<ORGANIZATION>.
