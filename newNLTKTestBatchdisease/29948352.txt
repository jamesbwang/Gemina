 Psoriatic<GPE> arthritis ( PsA<ORGANIZATION> ) may affect different joints, including the spine. The prevalence of spinal involvement is variable depending on the definition and a subset of patients have been identified in cohorts that do not have clinical features of axial disease and yet have imaging findings. Still, there is not a consensus on how and when to screen axial disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate factors associated with being underdiagnosed for axial psoriatic arthritis ( axPsA<ORGANIZATION> ) and its impacts on outcomes. Disease features and outcomes of axPsA<ORGANIZATION> according to the physician ( n = 415 ) were compared with patients with imaging findings only ( sacroiliitis fulfilling the modified New York<GPE> criteria, n = 112 ), using data from a real-life PsA<ORGANIZATION> registry. Patients with imaging findings only were more frequently women ( 83/220 ( 37.7 % ) vs 29/122 ( 23.8 % ) ; p = 0.008 ). This group also had higher peripheral disease activity ( imaging only vs clinical AxPsA: mean ( SD ) tender joint count 5.3 ( 6.1 ) vs 3.3 ( 4.7 ), swollen joint count 1.9 ( 2.9 ) vs 1.2 ( 2.4 ) ; p < 0.001 for both comparisons ) and was less often treated using TNF<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors ( 16.1 vs 38.2 % ; p < 0.001 ) than patients who were classified as axPsA<ORGANIZATION>. Patient-reported outcomes were similar in both groups. PsA<ORGANIZATION> patients, especially women with more severe peripheral disease, have a higher risk of being underdiagnosed for axPsA<ORGANIZATION>. The severity of peripheral symptoms may be a risk factor to mask the spinal features of PsA<ORGANIZATION>.
