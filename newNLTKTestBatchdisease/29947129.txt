 There are limited data regarding causes of mortality in patients with psoriasis ( PsO<ORGANIZATION> ) or psoriatic arthritis ( PsA<ORGANIZATION> ). This retrospective cohort study evaluated the risk and leading causes of mortality in patients with PsO/PsA. Individuals with a hospital-based diagnosis of PsA/PsO were identified using the Danish National Patient Registry<ORGANIZATION>. Matched<PERSON> control individuals were identified from the general population. Main<PERSON> outcome measures were risk of death and cause-specific mortality in patients with PsO/PsA. Death rates per 1,000 patient-years ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ), vs. controls, were 22.29 ( 19.71-24.87 ) vs. 13.89 ( 11.75-16.03 ) for PsO<ORGANIZATION> patients, and 10.83 ( 8.90-12.76 ) vs. 11.63 ( 9.64-13.62 ) for PsA<ORGANIZATION> patients, respectively. Survival, according to stratified hazard ratios ( HRs<ORGANIZATION> ), was significantly lower vs. controls in PsO<GPE> ( 1.74, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), but not in PsA<GPE> ( 1.06, P=0.190 ) patients. Significantly increased risk of death was observed in PsO<ORGANIZATION> patients vs. controls due to a number of causes ; highest risks were observed for diseases of the digestive system, endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and certain infectious and parasitic diseases ( HRs<ORGANIZATION> 3.61, 3.02 and 2.71, respectively ). In patients with PsA<ORGANIZATION>, increased mortality was only observed for certain infectious and parasitic diseases ( HR 2.80 ) and diseases of the respiratory system ( HR 1.46 ). Patients with PsO<ORGANIZATION> died at a younger age than controls ( mean age: 70.96 vs. 74.51 years ; P<PERSON> < 0.0001 ). Patients with severe PsO have an increased mortality risk vs. matched controls, due to a number of causes. Evidence to support an increased risk for PsA<ORGANIZATION> patients was less convincing.
