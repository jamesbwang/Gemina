 The proportion of antimicrobial resistance ( AMR<ORGANIZATION> ) among the ESKAPE<ORGANIZATION> and Escherichia<GPE> coli ( ESKAPEEc<ORGANIZATION> ) pathogens causing bloodstream infection ( BSI<ORGANIZATION> ) increased worldwide. We described longitudinal trends in ESKAPEEc<ORGANIZATION> BSI and AMR<ORGANIZATION> over 9 years ( 2007-2015 ) at a large teaching hospital in Italy<GPE>. Of 9720 unique BSI<ORGANIZATION> episodes, 6002 ( 61.7 % ) were caused by ESKAPEEc<ORGANIZATION> pathogens. The majority of these episodes ( 4374 ; 72.9 % ) were hospital-onset infections. The most frequent pathogen was E. coli ( 32.8 % ), followed by Staphylococcus<PERSON> aureus ( 20.6 % ), Klebsiella<GPE> pneumoniae ( 16.1 % ), and Pseudomonas<GPE> aeruginosa ( 11.6 % ). There was a significant increase of hospital-onset K. pneumoniae ( from 2.3 to 5.0 per 10,000 patient-days ; P<PERSON> = 0.001 ) and community-onset E. coli ( from 3.3 to 9. 1 per 10,000 emergency admissions ; P<PERSON> = 0.04 ) BSIs<ORGANIZATION>. Among hospital-onset BSIs<ORGANIZATION>, increases of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase ( ESBL<ORGANIZATION> ) -producing E. coli ( from 25.4 to 35.2 %, P<PERSON> = 0.006 ), carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae ( from 4.2 to 51.6 %, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), and methicillin-resistant<ORGANIZATION> S. aureus ( from 33.9 to 44.4 %, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) BSIs were observed between the 2007-2009 and 2010-2012 study periods. In contrast, a decrease of BSIs<ORGANIZATION> caused by P. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime ( from 45.5 to 28.2 %, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), ciprofloxacin ( from 46 to 36.3 %, P<PERSON> = 0.05 ), and meropenem ( from 55 to 39.9 %, P<PERSON> = 0.03 ) was observed through all 9 years of the study period. Among community-onset BSIs<ORGANIZATION>, increases of BSIs<ORGANIZATION> caused by ESBL-producing E. coli ( from 28.6 to 42.2 %, P<PERSON> = 0.002 ) and carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae ( from 0 to 17.6 % ) were observed between the 2007-2009 and 2010-2012 study periods. Our findings show increased rates of BSI<ORGANIZATION> and relative AMR<ORGANIZATION> for specific pathogen-health care setting combinations, and call for continued active surveillance and infection control policies.
