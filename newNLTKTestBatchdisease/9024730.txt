 To evaluate the relationship of aortic low attenuation plaque volume ( LAPV<ORGANIZATION> ) on multidetector computed tomography ( MDCT<ORGANIZATION> ) with the abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA<ORGANIZATION> ), the coronary arterial disease ( CAD<ORGANIZATION>, ≥50 % stenosis ), severe ( ≥90 % stenosis ) CAD<ORGANIZATION>, hypertension, and long-term ( ≥10 years ) hypertension. Curved<PERSON> planar reformations ( CPR<ORGANIZATION> ) of three segments ( the ascending, the arch, and the upper descending aorta ) of the thoracic aorta were generated with attenuation-dependent color codes to measure LAPV<ORGANIZATION> with 0~29 HU and total noncalcified plaque volume ( TNPV<ORGANIZATION> ) with 0~150 HU in 95 patients. Correlation coefficients were employed to assess the impact of each LAPV<ORGANIZATION> and TNPV<ORGANIZATION> on AAA<ORGANIZATION>, CAD<ORGANIZATION>, severe CAD<ORGANIZATION>, hypertension, and long-term hypertension. Each Mean LAPV/cm and TNPV/cm was statistically greater in the aortic arch than the ascending (
