 We investigated fundus autofluorescence ( FAF<ORGANIZATION> ) lifetimes in patients with retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) using fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy ( FLIO<ORGANIZATION> ). A total of 33 patients ( mean age, 40.0 ± 17.0 years ) with RP<ORGANIZATION> and an age-matched healthy group were included. The Heidelberg<ORGANIZATION> FLIO was used to detect FAF<ORGANIZATION> decays in short ( SSC<ORGANIZATION> ; 498-560 nm ) and long ( LSC<ORGANIZATION> ; 560-720 nm ) spectral channels. We investigated a 30° retinal field and calculated the amplitude-weighted mean fluorescence lifetime ( τ In RP<GPE>, FLIO<ORGANIZATION> shows a typical pattern of prolonged τ FLIO uniquely presents a distinct and specific signature in eyes affected with RP<ORGANIZATION>. The ring patterns show variations that indicate genetically determined pathologic processes. Shortening of FAF<ORGANIZATION> lifetimes in the LSC<ORGANIZATION> may indicate disease progression, as was previously demonstrated for Stargardt<PERSON> disease. Therefore, FLIO<ORGANIZATION> might be able to indicate disease progression in RP as well. Hyperfluorescent FLIO rings with short FAF<ORGANIZATION> lifetimes may provide insight into the pathophysiologic disease status of RP-affected retinas potentially providing a more detailed assessment of disease progression.
