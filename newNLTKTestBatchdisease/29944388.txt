 β-Klotho ( encoded by Klb<PERSON> ) is an obligate co-receptor mediating both fibroblast growth factor ( FGF<ORGANIZATION> ) 15 and FGF21<ORGANIZATION> signaling. Klb-/- mice are refractory to metabolic FGF15<ORGANIZATION> and FGF21<ORGANIZATION> action and exhibit derepressed ( increased ) bile acid ( BA ) synthesis. Here, we deeply phenotyped male Klb-/- mice on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background fed a chow diet, focusing on metabolic aspects. This aims to better understand the physiological consequences of concomitant FGF15<ORGANIZATION> and FGF21<ORGANIZATION> signaling deficiency, in particular on the gut-liver axis. Klb-/- mice present permanent growth restriction independent of adiposity and energy balance. Klb-/- mice also exhibit few changes in carbohydrate metabolism, combining normal gluco-tolerance, insulin sensitivity and fasting response with increased gluconeogenic capacity and decreased glycogen mobilization. Livers of Klb-/- mice reveal pathologic features, including a pro-inflammatory status and initiation of fibrosis. These defects are associated to a massive shift in BA<GPE> composition in the enterohepatic system and blood circulation featured by a large excess of microbiota-derived deoxycholic acid ( DCA<ORGANIZATION> ), classically known for its genotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, β-Klotho is a gatekeeper of hepatic integrity, through direct action ( mediating FGF21<ORGANIZATION> anti-inflammatory signaling ) and indirect mechanisms ( mediating FGF15<ORGANIZATION> signaling that maintain BA level and composition ).
