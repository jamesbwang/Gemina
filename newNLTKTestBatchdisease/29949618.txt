 The prevalence of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC<ORGANIZATION> ) is rising rapidly. However, there are no reliable serum biomarkers for PTC<ORGANIZATION>. This study aimed to investigate the validity of preoperative serum matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) as a biomarker for predicting prognosis of PTC<ORGANIZATION> after total or partial thyroidectomy. Male patients with PTC<ORGANIZATION> or a benign thyroid nodule ( BTN<ORGANIZATION> ) and healthy controls ( HCs<ORGANIZATION> ) were retrospectively included. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curves were constructed to evaluate the performance of preoperative serum MMP-2 in diagnosing PTC<ORGANIZATION>, predicting lymph node metastasis ( LNM<ORGANIZATION> ), and predicting structurally persistent/recurrent disease ( SPRD<ORGANIZATION> ). Multivariate logistic regression and Cox<PERSON> regression were applied to identify independent risk factors for SPRD<ORGANIZATION>. The preoperative serum MMP-2 concentration in the PTC<ORGANIZATION> group was higher than those in BTN<ORGANIZATION> and HC<ORGANIZATION> groups. The concentration of postoperative serum MMP-2 decreased in comparison with pre-operation. ROC<ORGANIZATION> curves showed that serum MMP-2 could differentially diagnose PTC<ORGANIZATION> from BTN<ORGANIZATION> at the cutoff value of 86.30 ng/ml with an area under the curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) of 0.905 and could predict central LNM<ORGANIZATION> ( CLNM<ORGANIZATION> ) at the cutoff value of 101.55 ng/ml with an AUC<ORGANIZATION> of 0.711. Serum<PERSON> MMP-2 ≥101.55 ng/ml, age ≥45 years, and advanced TNM<ORGANIZATION> stage were independent risk factors for CLNM<ORGANIZATION>. Patients with SPRD<ORGANIZATION> had a higher median MMP-2 level ( 149.22 ng/ml ) than patients without SPRD<ORGANIZATION> ( 104.55 ng/ml ). Serum MMP-2<PERSON> at the cutoff value of 144.04 ng/ml could predict SPRD<ORGANIZATION> in PTC<ORGANIZATION> patients with an AUC<ORGANIZATION> of 0.803. Advanced TNM<PERSON> stage and serum MMP-2 ≥144.04 ng/ml were independent risk factors for SPRD<ORGANIZATION>. Patients with serum MMP-2 ≥144.04 ng/ml had a worse clinical outcome than those with MMP-2 < 144.04 ng/ml. Preoperative serum MMP-2 may serve as a biomarker for diagnosing PTC<ORGANIZATION> and a predictive indicator for LNM<ORGANIZATION> and SPRD<ORGANIZATION> in male patients with PTC<ORGANIZATION>.
