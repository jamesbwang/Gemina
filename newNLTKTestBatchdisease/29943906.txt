 Malaria<GPE> is a deadly disease killing worldwide hundreds of thousands people each year and the responsible parasite has acquired resistance to the available drug combinations. The four vacuolar plasmepsins ( PMs<ORGANIZATION> ) in Plasmodium<GPE> falciparum involved in hemoglobin catabolism represent promising targets to combat drug resistance. High antimalarial activities can be achieved by developing a single drug that would simultaneously target all the vacuolar PMs<ORGANIZATION>. We have demonstrated for the first time the use of soluble recombinant plasmepsin II ( PMII<ORGANIZATION> ) for structure-guided drug discovery with KNI<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors. Compounds used in this study ( KNI-10742, 10743, 10395, 10333, and 10343 ) exhibit nanomolar inhibition against PMII<ORGANIZATION>, and are also effective in blocking the activities of PMI<ORGANIZATION> and PMIV<ORGANIZATION> with the low nanomolar K
