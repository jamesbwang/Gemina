 The TMEPAI<ORGANIZATION> family, composed of TMEPAI<ORGANIZATION> and C18ORF1<ORGANIZATION>, is known to inhibit TGF-β ( transforming growth factor-β ) signaling via its competition for binding of R-Smad ( receptor-regulated Smad ) with SARA<ORGANIZATION> ( Smad<ORGANIZATION> anchor for receptor activation ). However, TMEPAI<ORGANIZATION> has also been reported to be involved in AR<GPE> ( androgen receptor ) signaling, PTEN<ORGANIZATION> ( phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 ) signaling, and formation of autophagosomes in addition to degradation of TβRI<ORGANIZATION> ( TGF-β type I receptor ) through lysosomes. Thus, TMEPAI<ORGANIZATION> seems to act as a regulator of multiple signaling pathways. A great deal of attention has already been paid to the relationship between the TMEPAI<ORGANIZATION> family and tumorigenicity. In this paper, therefore, we describe recent progresses in the understanding of how the TMEPAI<ORGANIZATION> family physiologically contributes to cellular functions and diseases.
