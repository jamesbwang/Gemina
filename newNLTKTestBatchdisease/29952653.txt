 To analyze the expression profile, diagnostic and clinicopathological significances of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in sinonasal inverted papilloma ( SNIP<ORGANIZATION> ). The expression profile of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> was analyzed using a miRNA<ORGANIZATION> microarray approach. The potential functions and clinical significances of specific miRNAs were further analyzed by bioinformatics and statistical methods. The microarray assay identified 37 significantly upregulated and 21 downregulated miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in SNIP<GPE>. Of nine miRNAs randomly selected, the expression levels of seven miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION>. The potential target genes of several candidate miRNAs were enriched in some biological processes and cellular signaling pathways related to tumorigenesis. Receiever operating characteristic curve analysis for miR-214-3p indicated an area under the curve of 0.932. Notably, its expression level was significantly decreased in SNIP<ORGANIZATION> tissues and associated with SNIP<ORGANIZATION> staging and recurrence. MiR-214-3p can possibly serve as a valuable biomarker and a therapeutic target for SNIP<ORGANIZATION>.
