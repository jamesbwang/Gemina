 To investigate the frequency of oral paracoccidioidomycosis from representative geographic regions of Brazil<GPE>, and to compare data with a literature review. A retrospective study was conducted on 108,304 biopsies obtained from 1953 to 2016 at six Brazilian<GPE> oral and maxillofacial pathology services. Demographic data and clinical and histopathological diagnosis of oral paracoccidioidomycosis were evaluated. A literature review of oral paracoccidioidomycosis studies published in three electronic databases was carried out. Data were analysed descriptively. A total of 320 cases of oral paracoccidioidomycosis were surveyed ( 0.3 % of the oral lesions at the centres studied ). The lesions were more frequent among male patients. The gingiva/alveolar ridge was the most affected site. Mean age of affected individuals was 51.3 years ( Â±11.7 ). The literature review showed a higher incidence of oral paracoccidioidomycosis in the South-East and South<GPE> regions of Brazil<GPE>. Male individuals and individuals between 50 and 59 years were most affected. Oral paracoccidioidomycosis is an uncommon lesion observed in oral biopsy samples. The differences in the relative frequency of oral paracoccidioidomycosis are related to geographic variations. Men between 50 and 59 years are more affected. This study provides helpful information for clinicians in the diagnosis of oral paracoccidioidomycosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
