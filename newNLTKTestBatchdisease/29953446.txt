 Complications arising from infection with the carcinogenic liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini cause substantial morbidity and mortality in Thailand<GPE> and adjacent lower Mekong<GPE> countries. In parallel, the incidence rate of diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is increasing in this same region, and indeed worldwide. Many residents in opisthorchiasis-endemic regions also exhibit DM<ORGANIZATION>, but the hepatobiliary disease arising during the co-occurrence of these two conditions remains to be characterized. Here, the histopathological profile during co-occurrence of opisthorchiasis and DM<ORGANIZATION> was investigated in a rodent model of human opisthorchiasis in which diabetes was induced with streptozotocin. The effects of excretory/secretory products from the liver fluke, O. viverrini ( OVES<ORGANIZATION> ) on hepatocyte and cholangiocyte responses during hyperglycemic conditions also were monitored. Both the liver fluke-infected hamsters ( OV<ORGANIZATION> group ) and hamsters with DM<ORGANIZATION> lost weight compared to control hamsters. Weight<PERSON> loss was even more marked in the hamsters with both opisthorchiasis and DM<ORGANIZATION> ( OD<ORGANIZATION> group ). Hypertrophy of hepatocytes, altered biliary canaliculi, and biliary hyperplasia were more prominent in the OD<ORGANIZATION> group, compared with OV<ORGANIZATION> and DM<ORGANIZATION> groups. Profound oxidative DNA<ORGANIZATION> damage, evidenced by 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and periductal fibrosis characterized the OD<ORGANIZATION> compared to OV<ORGANIZATION> and DM<ORGANIZATION> hamsters. Upregulation of expression of cytokines in response to infection and impairment of the pathway for insulin receptor substrate ( IRS<ORGANIZATION> ) /phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases ( PI3K<ORGANIZATION> ) /protein kinase B ( AKT<ORGANIZATION> ) signaling attended these changes. In vitro, OVES<ORGANIZATION> and glucose provoked time- and dose-dependent effects on the proliferation of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In overview, the co-occurrence of opisthorchiasis and diabetes exacerbated pathophysiological damage to the hepatobiliary tract. We speculate that opisthorchiasis and diabetes together aggravate hepatobiliary pathogenesis through an IRS/PI3K/AKT-independent pathway.
