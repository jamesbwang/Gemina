 Arsenic<GPE> is a risk factor for several noncommunicable diseases, even at low doses. Urinary arsenic ( UAs<ORGANIZATION> ) concentration is a good biomarker for internal dose, and demographic, dietary, and lifestyle factors are proposed predictors in nonoccupationally exposed populations. However, most predictor studies are limited in terms of size and number of predictors. We investigated demographic, dietary, and lifestyle determinants of UAs<ORGANIZATION> concentrations in 744 postmenopausal Danish<GPE> women who had UAs<ORGANIZATION> measurements and questionnaire data on potential predictors. UAs concentrations were determined using mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ), and determinants of the concentration were investigated using univariate and multivariate regression models. We used a forward selection procedure for model optimization. In all models, fish, alcohol, and poultry intake were associated with higher UAs<ORGANIZATION> concentration, and tap water, fruit, potato, and dairy intake with lower concentration. A forward regression model explained 35 % (
