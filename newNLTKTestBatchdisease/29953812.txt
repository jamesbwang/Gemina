 There is an urgent need for strategies to combat dengue and other emerging viral infections. We reported that cyclin G-associated kinase ( GAK<ORGANIZATION> ), a cellular regulator of the clathrin-associated host adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-2, regulates intracellular trafficking of multiple unrelated RNA<ORGANIZATION> viruses during early and late stages of the viral lifecycle. We also reported the discovery of potent, selective GAK<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors based on an isothiazolo [ 4,3-b ] pyridine scaffold, albeit with moderate antiviral activity. Here, we describe our efforts leading to the discovery of novel isothiazolo [ 4,3-b ] pyridines that maintain high GAK<ORGANIZATION> affinity and selectivity. These compounds demonstrate improved in vitro activity against dengue virus, including in human primary dendritic cells, and efficacy against the unrelated Ebola<PERSON> and chikungunya viruses. Moreover, inhibition of GAK<ORGANIZATION> activity was validated as an important mechanism of antiviral action of these compounds. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of a GAK-targeted broad-spectrum approach for combating currently untreatable emerging viral infections.
