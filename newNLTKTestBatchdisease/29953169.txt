 Hepatitis<PERSON> C virus ( HCV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection and alcohol use disorder ( AUD<ORGANIZATION> ) both adversely affect the immune system resulting in alterations in immune cell signaling and inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to investigate how comorbid AUD<ORGANIZATION> contributes to abnormalities in inflammatory mediators and psychiatric impairments in adults with HCV<ORGANIZATION>. Alcohol<PERSON> use, mood, and inflammatory factors were evaluated at 3 time points ( baseline, week 4, and week 12 ) in Veterans<GPE> with HCV<ORGANIZATION>, with ( n = 42 ) and without ( n = 13 ) comorbid AUD<ORGANIZATION>. Peripheral indices of immune activation, blood-brain barrier ( BBB<ORGANIZATION> ) damage ( S100<ORGANIZATION> calcium-binding protein B [ S100B ] ), liver function, and viral load were measured using immunoassays and polymerase chain reaction assays. Comorbid<ORGANIZATION> AUD was associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, elevated levels of liver enzymes, and altered expression of inflammatory factors. Alcohol<PERSON> consumption was positively correlated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> analysis identified significant group differences in interleukin ( IL ) -8 ( p = 0.006 ), IL-10 ( p = 0.03 ), and S100B<GPE> ( p = 0.048 ), with increased levels in participants with AUD<ORGANIZATION>, which persisted over time despite reductions in alcohol use and no significant change in HCV<ORGANIZATION> viral load. Statistically significant effects of study group or time were not found for the other immune factors assessed. Exploratory receiver operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the ability of IL-8, IL-10, and S100B<PERSON> to differentiate between levels of alcohol consumption and generated biomarker cutoff values used to identify low risk and unhealthy alcohol use groups. These results demonstrate that HCV<ORGANIZATION> and comorbid AUD are associated with greater psychiatric impairments, potentially resulting from increased inflammation, dysregulated cytokine expression, and compromised BBB<ORGANIZATION> function. Alcohol-induced BBB<ORGANIZATION> damage may increase the risk of neuropathological consequences within the context of chronic HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection.
