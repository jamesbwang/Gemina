 Acute<GPE> bacterial meningitis remains a life-threatening infectious disease with considerable morbidity and mortality. DNA-based detection methods are an urgent requisite for meningitis-causing bacterial pathogens for the prevention of outbreaks and control of infections. We proposed a novel PCR-mass spectrometry ( PCR-Mass ) assay for the simultaneous detection of four meningitis-causing agents, Neisseria<GPE> meningitidis, Streptococcus<GPE> pneumoniae, Haemophilus<GPE> influenzae, and Mycobacterium<GPE> tuberculosis in the present study. A total of 138 cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF<ORGANIZATION> ) samples ( including 56 CSF culture positive, 44 CSF culture negative, and 38 CSF control ) were enrolled and analyzed by PCR/Mass. Results were compared to real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION> detection. These four targeting pathogens could be discriminated without cross-reaction by the accurate detection of the corresponding extension products with different masses. The limits of detection were 102 copies/reaction for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis and 103 for M. tuberculosis. The evaluation of the culture-positive CSF<ORGANIZATION> specimens from the meningitis patients provided an overall agreement rate of 85.7 % with PCR-Mass and real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION>. The PCR-Mass was also able to detect the targeting pathogens from culture-negative CSF<ORGANIZATION> specimens from meningitis patients receiving early antibiotic treatment. PCR-Mass could be used for the molecular detection of bacterial meningitis and tuberculosis, especially when early antibiotic treatment has been administered to the suspected patients.
