 Cardiac<GPE> repolarization of black athletes has a distinctive pattern. During an episode of pericarditis, this pattern may evolve into a `` pseudonormalized '' electrocardiography ( ECG<ORGANIZATION> ). On resolution of the pericardial inflammation, the ECG<ORGANIZATION> may return to the normal variant for a black athlete, sounding the alarms of extended disease to the myocardium. Recognizing the normal variant for a black athlete will reduce the need for unnecessary further testing or treatments. The case is discussed in detail.
