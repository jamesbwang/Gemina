 The disease-focused panel ( DFP<ORGANIZATION> ) program was created by the Society<ORGANIZATION> of Abdominal Radiology<ORGANIZATION> ( SAR<ORGANIZATION> ) as a mechanism to `` improve patient care, education, and research '' in a `` particular disease or a particular aspect of a disease ''. The DFP<ORGANIZATION> on renal cell carcinoma ( RCC<ORGANIZATION> ) was proposed in 2014 and has been functional for 4 years. Although nominally focused on RCC<ORGANIZATION>, the scope of the DFP<ORGANIZATION> has included indeterminate renal masses because many can not be assigned a specific diagnosis when detected. Since its founding, the DFP<ORGANIZATION> has been active in a variety of clinical, research, and educational projects to optimize the care of patients with known or suspected RCC<ORGANIZATION>. The DFP<ORGANIZATION> is utilizing multi-institutional and cross-disciplinary collaboration to differentiate benign from malignant disease, optimize the management of early stage RCC<ORGANIZATION>, and ultimately to differentiate indolent from aggressive cancers. Several additional projects have worked to develop a quantitative biomarker that predicts metastatic RCC<ORGANIZATION> response to anti-angiogenic therapy. While disease focus is the premise by which all DFPs are created, it is likely that in the future the RCC<ORGANIZATION> DFP will need to expand or create new panels that will focus on other specific aspects of RCC-a result that the program 's founders envisioned. New knowledge creates a need for more focus.
