 People who inject drugs ( PWID<ORGANIZATION> ) have high rates of Hepatitis<ORGANIZATION> C Virus ( HCV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection. Little is known about the rates of diagnosis and treatment for HCV<ORGANIZATION> among PWID<ORGANIZATION>. Therefore, this study aims to characterize the cascade of care in Vancouver<GPE>, Canada<GPE> to improve HCV<ORGANIZATION> treatment access and delivery for PWID<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> were derived from three prospective cohort studies of PWID<ORGANIZATION> in Vancouver<GPE>, Canada<GPE> between December 2005 and May 2015. We identified the progression of participants through five steps in the cascade of care: ( 1 ) chronic HCV<ORGANIZATION> ; ( 2 ) linkage to HCV<ORGANIZATION> care ; ( 3 ) liver disease assessment ; ( 4 ) initiation of treatment ; and ( 5 ) completion of treatment. Predictors of undergoing liver disease assessment for HCV<ORGANIZATION> treatment were identified using a multivariable extended Cox regression model. Among 1571 participants with chronic HCV<ORGANIZATION>, 1359 ( 86.5 % ) had ever been linked to care, 1257 ( 80.0 % ) had undergone liver disease assessment, 163 ( 10.4 % ) had ever started HCV<ORGANIZATION> treatment, and 71 ( 4.5 % ) had ever completed treatment. In multivariable analyses, HIV<ORGANIZATION> seropositivity, use of methadone maintenance therapy, and hospitalization in the past 6 months were independently and positively associated with undergoing liver disease assessment ( all P < 0.001 ), while daily heroin injection was independently and negatively associated with undergoing liver disease assessment ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). Among this cohort of PWID<ORGANIZATION>, few had been started on or completed treatment for HCV<ORGANIZATION>. Our findings highlight the need to improve the prescribing of HCV<ORGANIZATION> treatment among PWID<ORGANIZATION> with active substance use.
