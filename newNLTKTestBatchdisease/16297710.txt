 Inducible<GPE> nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS<ORGANIZATION> ) plays an important role in inflammation, which has also been considered as a major driver of breast cancer disease progression. Radix Glycyrrhiza<PERSON> ( RG ) has been broadly used for its anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic effects. However, the mechanisms of regulation of iNOS<ORGANIZATION> in inflammation and cancer have not been fully explored. Total flavonoids isolated from RG<GPE> ( TFRG<ORGANIZATION> ) exhibited anti-inflammatory activity through the regulation of ERK/NF-
