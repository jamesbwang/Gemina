 In recent years, acute severe outbreaks of infectious bursal disease ( IBD<ORGANIZATION> ) are frequently observed in commercial chicken populations of the North East<LOCATION> Region ( NER<ORGANIZATION> ) of India<GPE>, resulting in huge economic loses to poultry farmers. Field<PERSON> outbreaks of IBD<ORGANIZATION> in 30 different poultry farms in the NER<ORGANIZATION> were confirmed by clinicopathologic examination and reverse transcriptase PCR<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 10 isolates of IBD<ORGANIZATION> virus ( IBDV<ORGANIZATION> ) from these outbreaks were characterized by the genetic analysis of VP1<ORGANIZATION> and the hypervariable region of the VP2<ORGANIZATION> gene. Nucleotide sequences, deduced amino acid sequences, and phylogenetic analysis of both VP2<ORGANIZATION> and VP1<ORGANIZATION> genes revealed two genetically diverse strains of very virulent IBDV<ORGANIZATION> ( vvIBDV<ORGANIZATION> ) and one intermediate strain circulating in the NER<ORGANIZATION>. These isolates differ at nucleotide and amino acid levels from vvIBDV<ORGANIZATION> isolates of mainland India<GPE> and are clustered in distinctly separate groups in the phylogenetic tree. Six of the isolates revealed a unique combination of vvIBDV<ORGANIZATION> amino acid signatures in the VP2<ORGANIZATION> gene ( A222<ORGANIZATION>, I256<PERSON>, I294<GPE> ), while bearing the non-vvIBDV amino acid signatures of the VP1<ORGANIZATION> gene ( 146E, 147G, 242D ), but they are clearly classified as vvIBDV<ORGANIZATION> in a phylogenetic analysis of both genes. Interestingly, one of the isolates showed 99 % sequence homology with attenuated vaccine strains in the VP2<ORGANIZATION> gene and clustered together. This study demonstrates the diversity of IBDVs<ORGANIZATION> in India<GPE> and document for the first time the possible involvement of attenuated vaccine strains in the epidemiology of IBD<ORGANIZATION> in India<GPE>.
