 In healthy skin, epidermis and dermis are anchored together at the dermal-epidermal junction ( DEJ<ORGANIZATION> ), a specialized basement membrane pivotal for skin integrity and function. However, increased inflammation in the DEJ<ORGANIZATION> is associated with the disruption and separation of this junction and sub-epidermal blistering. Granzyme B<PERSON> ( GzmB<ORGANIZATION> ) is a serine protease secreted by immune cells. Dysregulated inflammation may lead to increased GzmB<ORGANIZATION> accumulation and proteolysis in the extracellular milieu. Although elevated GzmB<ORGANIZATION> is observed at the level of the DEJ<ORGANIZATION> in inflammatory and blistering skin conditions, the present study is the first to explore GzmB<ORGANIZATION> in the context of DEJ<ORGANIZATION> degradation in autoimmune sub-epidermal blistering. In the present study, GzmB<ORGANIZATION> induced separation of the DEJ<ORGANIZATION> in healthy human skin. Subsequently, α6/β4 integrin, collagen VII<ORGANIZATION>, and collagen XVII were identified as extracellular substrates for GzmB<ORGANIZATION> through western blot, and specific cleavage sites were identified by mass spectrometry. In human bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, GzmB<ORGANIZATION> was elevated at the DEJ<ORGANIZATION> when compared to healthy samples, while α6/β4 integrin, collagen VII<ORGANIZATION>, and collagen XVII<ORGANIZATION> were reduced or absent in the area of blistering. In summary, our results suggest that regardless of the initial causation of sub-epidermal blistering, GzmB<ORGANIZATION> activity is a common final pathway that could be amenable to a single targeted treatment approach.
