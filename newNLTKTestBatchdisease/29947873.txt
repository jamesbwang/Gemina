 Early renal dysfunction is associated with a 38 % increased fracture risk in individuals aged 65 years and older. In men but not women, early renal dysfunction is associated with decreased femoral neck bone mineral density ( BMD<ORGANIZATION> ) which can be partially explained by increased parathyroid hormone ( PTH<ORGANIZATION> ) concentrations. It is uncertain whether early renal dysfunction is associated with osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of decreased renal function with BMD<ORGANIZATION> and fracture risk and the role of PTH<ORGANIZATION> therein. We analyzed data of participants aged 65 years and older from the Longitudinal<ORGANIZATION> Aging Study Amsterdam. A 6-year fracture follow-up was obtained in 1477 participants. BMD<ORGANIZATION> was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( n = 535 ) and vertebral fractures by lateral spinal radiograph ( n = 527 ) in a subsample at baseline. Glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) was estimated according to the modification of diet in renal disease equation and assessed by the five stages of chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). In men and women, eGFR < 57 ml/min/1.73 m In men and women, early decreased renal function ( eGFR<ORGANIZATION> < 60 ml/min/1.73 m
