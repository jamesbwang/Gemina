 Pilonidal<GPE> sinus disease ( PSD<ORGANIZATION> ) is associated with a complex disease process in children, and its management remains controversial. There are a few published studies on PSD<ORGANIZATION> in the paediatric literature ; therefore, we present our experience of conservatively treating PSD<ORGANIZATION> in children. This study involved a retrospective review with telephone follow up. All children diagnosed with PSD<ORGANIZATION> in 2012 to 2017 were identified at the outpatient clinic of the Department<ORGANIZATION> of Paediatric Surgery<ORGANIZATION>. All patients initially underwent conservative treatment ( meticulous hair removal, improved perianal hygiene, warm sitz baths, and drainage for abscess ). Data<PERSON> collection included demographics, type of management, recurrence, presence of infection, and total healing time. In the study period, 29 children were identified. Their mean age was 14.94 ± 1.09 ( range: 12-16 ) years, and 51.7 % were girls. The mean length of follow up was 8.34 ± 6.36 ( range: 1-25 ) months. Complete healing occurred in 79.3 % of patients. Recurrence<PERSON> was evident in 12 % of patients. Four patients underwent surgery. PSD<ORGANIZATION> is being seen in children more frequently in recent years. Conservative treatment may be the recommended initial approach for PSD<ORGANIZATION> in children.
