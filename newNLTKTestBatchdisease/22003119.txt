 Myelin-associated proteins such as Nogo-A are major inhibitors of neuronal plasticity that contribute to permanent neurological impairments in the injured CNS<ORGANIZATION>. In the present study, we investigated the influence of Nogo-A on visual recovery after retinal injuries in mice. Different doses of N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA<ORGANIZATION> ) were injected in the vitreous of the left eye to induce retinal neuron death. The visual function was monitored using the optokinetic response ( OKR<ORGANIZATION> ) as a behavior test, and electroretinogram ( ERG<ORGANIZATION> ) and local field potential ( LFP<ORGANIZATION> ) recordings allowed to assess changes in retinal and cortical neuron activity, respectively. Longitudinal OKR<ORGANIZATION> follow-ups revealed reversible visual deficits after injection of NMDA<ORGANIZATION> ≤ 1 nmole in the left eye and concomitant functional improvement in the contralateral visual pathway of the right eye that was let intact. Irreversible OKR<ORGANIZATION> loss observed with NMDA<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 2 nmol was correlated with massive retinal cell death and important ERG<ORGANIZATION> response decline. Strikingly, the OKR<ORGANIZATION> mediated by injured and intact eye stimulation was markedly improved in Nogo-A KO mice compared with WT<ORGANIZATION> animals, suggesting that the inactivation of Nogo-A promotes visual recovery and plasticity. Moreover, OKR<ORGANIZATION> improvement was associated with shorter latency of the N2 wave of Nogo-A KO LFPs relative to WT animals. Strikingly, intravitreal injection of anti-Nogo-A antibody ( 11C7 ) in the injured eye exerted positive effects on cortical LFPs<ORGANIZATION>. This study presents the intrinsic ability of the visual system to recover from NMDA-induced retinal injury and its limitations. Nogo-A neutralization may promote visual recovery in retinal diseases such as glaucoma.
