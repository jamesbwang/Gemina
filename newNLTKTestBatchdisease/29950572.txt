 Although classically appreciated for their role as the powerhouse of the cell, the metabolic functions of mitochondria reach far beyond bioenergetics. In this Review, we discuss how mitochondria catabolize nutrients for energy, generate biosynthetic precursors for macromolecules, compartmentalize metabolites for the maintenance of redox homeostasis and function as hubs for metabolic waste management. We address the importance of these roles in both normal physiology and in disease.
