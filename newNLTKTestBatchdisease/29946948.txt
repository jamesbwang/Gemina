 Oil<GPE> extraction from the kernels of Argania<GPE> spinosa ( L. ) Skeels<GPE> ( Sapotaceae<ORGANIZATION> ), an endemic tree of Morocco<GPE>, produces argan press-cake ( APC<ORGANIZATION> ) used as a shampoo and to treat sprains, scabies, and for healing wounds. We have previously reported that argan oil has antimelanogenesis effect. Here, we determined if the by-product, APC<ORGANIZATION>, has melanogenesis regulatory effect using B16<PERSON> murine melanoma cells. The effect of APC<ORGANIZATION> ethanol extract on cell proliferation and melanin content of B16<GPE> cells were measured, and to elucidate the mechanism involved, the expression level of melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase ( TYR<ORGANIZATION> ), dopachrome tautomerase ( DCT<ORGANIZATION> ), and tyrosinase-related protein 1 ( TRP1<ORGANIZATION> ) were determined and mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression level of microphthalmia- associated transcription factor ( Mitf<ORGANIZATION> ) and Tyr<ORGANIZATION> genes were quantified. APC<ORGANIZATION> ethanol extract showed a significant melanin biosynthesis inhibitory effect on B16 cells in a time-dependent manner without cytotoxicity, which could be due to the decreased expression of TYR<ORGANIZATION>, TRP1<ORGANIZATION>, and DCT<ORGANIZATION> in a time-dependent manner. APC<ORGANIZATION> extract down regulated Mitf<PERSON> and Tyr<PERSON>. Decreased TRP1<ORGANIZATION> and DCT<ORGANIZATION> levels could be due to post-translational modifications. These results suggest that APC<ORGANIZATION> extract may be used as a new source of natural whitening products and may be introduced as an important pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperpigmentation disorders.
