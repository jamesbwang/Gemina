 Prophylaxis with clotting factor replacement products is recommended by the Medical<ORGANIZATION> and Scientific Advisory Council<ORGANIZATION> of the National Hemophilia Foundation<ORGANIZATION> as the optimal therapy for the prevention of bleeding episodes in individuals with severe hemophilia A or B ( < 1 IU per dL endogenous factor VIII<ORGANIZATION> or factor IX activity, respectively ). Prophylaxis is associated with an improved health-related quality of life and has been shown to be cost-effective compared with on-demand therapy. However, the overall cost of treatment remains high, particularly among patients with a greater propensity to bleed. The overall value of hemophilia treatments and their associated benefits, measured in quality-adjusted life-years ( QALYs<ORGANIZATION> ), and dollar costs compared with other interventions can be evaluated through the use of cost-utility analyses ( CUAs<ORGANIZATION> ). Previous CUA<ORGANIZATION> studies in hemophilia have focused primarily on patients with more severe forms of hemophilia and on prophylaxis compared with on-demand treatment. However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have utilized QALYs<ORGANIZATION> as a standardized outcome measure to systematically evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of current hemophilia treatment options. To systematically review the CUA<ORGANIZATION> literature of hemophilia treatments and demonstrate the challenges in producing cost-utility evidence compared with other rare diseases. We conducted a systematic literature review using the Tufts Medical Center<ORGANIZATION> Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database<ORGANIZATION> for English-language CUAs published from 2000 through 2015 with the search terms hemophilia, haemophilia, factor VIII<ORGANIZATION>, or factor IX. Two trained reviewers independently reviewed every study to extract relevant data. Incremental<ORGANIZATION> cost-effectiveness ratios were converted to 2014 U.S.<GPE> dollars using exchange rates for currency conversion and the Consumer<ORGANIZATION> Price Index to adjust for inflation. Our search yielded 52 studies, 11 of which met our inclusion criteria. The cost-effectiveness of hemophilia treatments varied widely based on variations in the study designs, including differences in time horizon, discount rates, and medical interventions. We found the cost-effectiveness of hemophilia treatments to be broadly comparable to that of other orphan drugs. Improved standardization of future CUA<ORGANIZATION> studies will be important for further evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of hemophilia treatments.
