 Liver elastography have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ) with higher values ; however, it is unclear to identify morbimortality risk on liver transplantation waiting list. To assess liver stiffness, ultrasound and clinical findings in cirrhotic patients with and without HCC<ORGANIZATION> on screening for liver transplant and compare the morbimortality risk with elastography and MELD<ORGANIZATION> score. Patients with cirrhosis and HCC<ORGANIZATION> on screening for liver transplant were enrolled with clinical, radiological and laboratory assessments, and transient elastography. 103 patients were included ( without HCC<ORGANIZATION> n=58 ( 66 % ) ; HCC<ORGANIZATION> n=45 ( 44 % ). The mean MELD<ORGANIZATION> score was 14.7±6.4, the portal hypertension present on 83.9 % and the mean transient elastography value was 32.73±22.5 kPa. The median acoustic radiation force impulse value of liver parenchyma was 1.98 ( 0.65-3.2 ) m/s and 2.16 ( 0.59-2.8 ) m/s in HCC<ORGANIZATION> group. The HCC<ORGANIZATION> group was significantly associated with HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection ( OR 26.84 ; p < 0.0001 ), higher levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein ( OR 5.51 ; p=0.015 ), clinical portal hypertension ( OR 0.25 ; p=0.032 ) and similar MELD<ORGANIZATION> score ( p=0.693 ). The area under the receiver operating characteristics ( AUROC<ORGANIZATION> ) showed sensitivity and specificity for serum alpha-fetoprotein ( cutoff 9.1 ng/ml ), transient elastography value ( cutoff value 9 kPa ), and acoustic radiation force impulse value ( cutoff value 2.56 m/s ) of 50 % and 86 %, 92 % and 17 % and 21 % and 92 %, respectively. The survival group had a mean transient elastography value of 31.65±22.2 kPa vs. 50.87±20.9 kPa ( p=0.098 ) and higher MELD<ORGANIZATION> scores ( p=0.035 ). Elastography<PERSON>, ultrasound and clinical findings are important non-invasive tools for cirrhosis and HCC<ORGANIZATION> on screening for liver transplant. Higher values in liver elastography and MELD<ORGANIZATION> scores predict mortality.
