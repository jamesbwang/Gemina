 We evaluated the relationship between new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI<ORGANIZATION> ) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI<ORGANIZATION> ) drug use and respiratory-related morbidity and mortality among older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ) .This was retrospective, population-based, cohort study using Ontario<PERSON>, Canada<GPE>, heath administrative data. Individuals ages 66 years of age and older, with validated, physician-diagnosed COPD<ORGANIZATION> ( n=131,718 ) were included. New SSRI/SNRI users were propensity score matched 1:1 to controls on 40 relevant covariates to minimize potential confounding.Among propensity-scored matched community-dwelling individuals, new SSRI/SNRI users compared to non-users had significantly higher rates of hospitalization for COPD<ORGANIZATION> or pneumonia ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.15 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.05-1.25 ), ER<ORGANIZATION> visits for COPD<ORGANIZATION> or pneumonia ( HR 1.13 ; 95 % CI 1.03-1.24 ), COPD<ORGANIZATION> or pneumonia-related mortality ( HR 1.26 ; 95 % CI 1.03-1.55 ) and all-cause mortality ( HR 1.20 ; 95 % CI 1.11-1.29 ). Respiratory-specific and all-cause mortality rates were also higher among long term care home residents newly starting SSRI/SNRI drugs
