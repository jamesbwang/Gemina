 The purpose of this study was to examine contralateral inhibition of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions ( TEOAEs<ORGANIZATION> ) in young adults with normal hearing as a function of ear and sex. Young<PERSON> female ( n = 50 ) and male ( n = 50 ) adults with normal hearing participated. TEOAEs were measured bilaterally with 80 dB peSPL<ORGANIZATION> nonlinear clicks and 60 dB peSPL<ORGANIZATION> linear clicks with and without a contralateral broadband noise elicitor at 65 dB SPL<ORGANIZATION>. Absolute TEOAE<PERSON> inhibition and normalized TEOAE<ORGANIZATION> inhibition ( i.e., percentage of inhibition ) were examined. With both 80 and 60 dB peSPL evoking stimuli, there were significant main effects of ear and sex ( p < .05 ). TEOAE levels were larger in women and in the right ear. There were no statistically significant main effects of ear and sex on absolute TEOAE<ORGANIZATION> inhibition ( p > .05 ). Significant main effects of ear and sex were, however, found with normalized TEOAE<ORGANIZATION> inhibition ( p < .05 ; greater in men and in the left ear ). Statistically significant negative correlations and significant linear predictive relations were found between TEOAE<ORGANIZATION> levels and normalized TEOAE<ORGANIZATION> inhibitions in both ears ( p < .001 ). There is no evidence of the same with absolute inhibition of TEOAEs<GPE> ( p > .05 ). If one considers that efferent inhibition of TEOAEs<ORGANIZATION> is an absolute quantity, the significant effect of ear and sex on normalized inhibition and the negative association and linear predictive relationship between TEOAE<ORGANIZATION> level and inhibition can be viewed as spurious effects. As such, contralateral inhibition of TEOAEs<ORGANIZATION> does not suggest sex or ear laterality effects.
