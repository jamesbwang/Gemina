 Fibroblasts play an important role in lung homeostasis and disease. In lung fibrosis, fibroblasts adopt a proliferative and migratory phenotype, with increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin ( αSMA<ORGANIZATION> ) and enhanced secretion of extracellular matrix components. Comprehensive profiling of fibroblast heterogeneity is limited, due to a lack of specific cell-surface markers. We have previously profiled the surface proteome of primary human lung fibroblasts. Here, we sought to define and quantify a panel of cluster of differentiation markers in primary human lung fibroblasts and IPF<ORGANIZATION> lung tissue, using immunofluorescence and FACS<ORGANIZATION> analysis. Fibroblast function was assessed by analysis of replicative senescence. We observed presence of distinct fibroblast phenotypes in vivo, characterized by various combinations of Desmin<GPE>, αSMA<ORGANIZATION>, CD36<ORGANIZATION>, or CD97<ORGANIZATION> expression. Most markers demonstrated stable expression over passages in vitro, but significant changes were observed for CD36<ORGANIZATION>, CD54<ORGANIZATION>, CD82<ORGANIZATION>, CD106<ORGANIZATION>, and CD140a<ORGANIZATION>. Replicative senescence of fibroblasts was observed from passage 10 onward. CD36- and CD97-positive, but αSMA-negative, cells were present in remodeled areas of IPF<ORGANIZATION> lungs. Transforming growth factor- treatment induced SMA and collagen I expression, but repressed CD36- and CD97<ORGANIZATION> expression. We identified a panel of stable surface markers in human lung fibroblasts, applicable for positive cell isolation directly from lung tissue. TGF-β exposure represses CD36- and CD97<ORGANIZATION> expression, while increasing αSMA<ORGANIZATION> expression ; we therefore identified complex surface protein changes during fibroblast-myofibroblast activation. Co-existence of quiescence and activated fibroblast subtypes in the IPF<ORGANIZATION> lung suggests dynamic remodeling of fibroblast activation upon subtle changes to growth factor exposure in local microenvironmental niches.
