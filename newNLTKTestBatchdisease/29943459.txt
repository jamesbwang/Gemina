 Genetic<GPE> background influences allergic immune responses to environmental stimuli. Non-obese diabetic ( NOD<ORGANIZATION> ) mice are highly susceptible to environmental stimuli. Little<PERSON> is known about the interaction of autoimmune genetic factors with innate immunity in allergies, especially skin hypersensitivity. To study the interplay of innate immunity and autoimmune genetic factors in contact hypersensitivity ( CHS<ORGANIZATION> ) by using various innate immunity-deficient NOD<ORGANIZATION> mice. Toll-like receptor ( TLR<ORGANIZATION> ) 2-deficient, TLR9-deficient and MyD88-deficient NOD<ORGANIZATION> mice were used to investigate CHS<ORGANIZATION>. The cellular mechanism was determined by flow cytometry in vitro and adoptive cell transfer in vivo. To investigate the role of MyD88<ORGANIZATION> in dendritic cells ( DCs<ORGANIZATION> ) in CHS<ORGANIZATION>, we also used CD11c We found that innate immunity negatively regulates CHS<ORGANIZATION>, as innate immunity-deficient NOD<ORGANIZATION> mice developed exacerbated CHS<ORGANIZATION> accompanied by increased numbers of skin-migrating CD11c Our results suggest that the autoimmune-prone NOD<ORGANIZATION> genetic background aggravates CHS<ORGANIZATION> regulated by innate immunity, through DCs<ORGANIZATION> and T effector cells.
