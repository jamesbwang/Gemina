 The Bethesda System<ORGANIZATION> for reporting thyroid cytopathology ( BSRTC<ORGANIZATION> ) predicts an incidence of malignancy of less than 5 % in thyroid nodules with a benign diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration ( FNA<ORGANIZATION> ). However, recent series have suggested that the true rate of malignancy might be significantly higher in this category of patients. We reviewed our experience by performing a retrospective analysis of patients with benign thyroid FNA<ORGANIZATION> results who underwent thyroidectomy between 2008 and 2013 at a large academic center. Information including demographics, ultrasound features, FNA<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis, and surgical follow-up information were recorded. Slides were reviewed on cytology-histology discrepant cases, and it was determined whether the discrepancy was due to sampling or interpretation error. A total of 802 FNA cases with a benign diagnosis and surgical follow-up were identified. FNA<ORGANIZATION> diagnoses included 738 cases of benign goiter and 64 cases of lymphocytic thyroiditis. On subsequent surgical resection, 144 cases were found to be neoplastic, including 117 malignant cases. False<PERSON> negative, defined as interpretation error and inadequate biopsy of the nodule harboring malignancy, was 6 %. When cases of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features ( NIFTP<ORGANIZATION> ) were excluded from the analysis, false-negative rate was 5 %. When microPTC<ORGANIZATION> cases were excluded, false-negative rate was 3 % and was slightly less than 3 % when both microPTC<ORGANIZATION> and NIFTP<ORGANIZATION> cases were excluded from the analysis. Retrospective review of neoplastic cases showed that 57 % were due to sampling error and 43 % were due to interpretation error. Interpretation error was more likely to occur in follicular patterned neoplasms ( 75 % ), while sampling error was more common in non-follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( non-FVPTC ) ( 61 % ). With the exclusion of microPTC<ORGANIZATION>, interpretation errors were still more likely to occur in follicular neoplasms ( 79 % ) but there was no significant difference in sampling error between non-FVPTC ( 37 % ) and follicular patterned neoplasms ( 42 % ). Tumor<PERSON> size was larger in cases with interpretation error ( mean = 2.3 cm ) compared to cases with sampling error ( mean = 1.4 cm ). This study shows that the false-negative rate of thyroid FNA<ORGANIZATION> at our institution is not significantly above the rate suggested by the BSRTC<ORGANIZATION>. Interpretation errors were more likely to occur in follicular patterned neoplasms, while non-FVPTC was more frequently found in false negative cases due to inadequate sampling.
