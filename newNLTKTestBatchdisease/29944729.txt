To identify resources, methods, and/or complementary treatments to alleviate the pain symptoms of endometriosis, and to identify adverse effects of treatments. Lilacs<PERSON>, Scielo<PERSON>, PEDro<ORGANIZATION>, Scopus<GPE>, Pubmed<PERSON>, CENTRAL Cochrane<ORGANIZATION>, Science Direct<PERSON>, and Google Scholar<PERSON> were searched for studies published in Portuguese<GPE>, English<GPE>, and Spanish<GPE> to July 31, 2017, using the terms `` physical therapy '' OR `` complementary treatment '' AND `` endometriosis ''. Randomized<PERSON> controlled trials relating to complementary pelvic pain treatment and adverse effects. Eight studies were identified ; two studies were included in the meta-analysis.
