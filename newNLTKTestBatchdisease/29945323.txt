 Paraoxonase1<GPE> ( PON1<ORGANIZATION> ) is an antioxidant which confers antioxidant properties to high-density lipoprotein ( HDL<ORGANIZATION> ) and prevents low-density lipoprotein ( LDL<ORGANIZATION> ) oxidation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the activities of PON1<ORGANIZATION> and oxidative/antioxidative stress markers in acute cerebral infarction. In this study, 161 patients diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction and 161 gender- and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Based on the clinicoradiological profiles, the patients were further classified into two groups: lacunar infarction group and large-artery atherosclerosis group. We measured the individual lipid status parameters, oxidative and antioxidative stress status parameters, and PON1<ORGANIZATION> activity. Serum<PERSON> total cholesterol ( TC ), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ), and oxidative stress parameters in patients with acute cerebral infarction were significantly higher than those in the normal controls ( p < 0.05 ). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) level, PON1<ORGANIZATION> activity, superoxide dismutase ( SOD<ORGANIZATION> ) activity, and antioxidative stress parameters in patients were lower than in the normal controls ( p < 0.05 ). Superoxide anion ( O2- ), malondialdehyde ( MDA<ORGANIZATION> ), and PON1<ORGANIZATION> levels in the lacunar infarction group were lower than in the large-artery atherosclerosis group ( p < 0.05 ). Oxidative stress markers and PON1<ORGANIZATION> activity are sensitive indicators of acute cerebral infarction. Our findings suggest a severely impaired antioxidative protection mechanism in these patients. Our study provides new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute cerebral infarction, which may also provide new therapeutic targets for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.
