 To assess the prevalence of thyroid diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM<ORGANIZATION> ) in comparison with normal population ; to determine prevalence of T2DM<ORGANIZATION> in patients with thyroid diseases. First group consisted of 60 patients with T2DM<ORGANIZATION> without previous history of thyroid disease. Second group consisted of 60 patients with thyroid disease without any previously known impairment of glucose metabolism. Control<ORGANIZATION> group ( CG ) included 100 subjects who had no previous history of thyroid disease or glucose metabolism impairment. Blood tests were performed to evaluate thyroid and glucose metabolism parameters. We found a significantly higher prevalence of thyroid diseases in patients with T2DM<ORGANIZATION> when compared to CG. Patients with T2DM<ORGANIZATION> showed to have higher serum levels of free triiodothyronine ( fT3<ORGANIZATION> ), thyroid‑stimulating hormone ( TSH<ORGANIZATION> ) and anti-thyroid peroxidase ( anti-TPO ) autoantibodies. We found no statistical significance in prevalence of T2DM<ORGANIZATION> in patients with thyroid diseases and CG<ORGANIZATION>. Among parameters of glucose metabolism, there were only higher fasting glucose levels in patients with hyperthyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease ( AITD<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients with T2DM<ORGANIZATION> showed to have higher prevalence of AITD<ORGANIZATION> and primary hypothyroidism. We did not find higher prevalence of T2DM<ORGANIZATION> in patients with thyroid diseases ( Tab<ORGANIZATION>. 3, Ref<PERSON>. 29 ).
