 Infliximab<GPE> is an anti-tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα<ORGANIZATION> ) monoclonal antibody that treats moderate-to-severe Crohn<PERSON> 's disease. In rare cases, infliximab has been associated with drug-induced aseptic meningitis. We present a 46-year-old woman with migraines and inflammatory Crohn<PERSON> 's colitis treated with intravenous infliximab and methotrexate. She developed nuchal rigidity, photophobia, and headache 2 days after each of her infliximab infusions, with symptom resolution 1 week post-infusion. Her exam, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were consistent with drug-induced aseptic meningitis. She discontinued infliximab and started vedolizumab with continued remission of her Crohn<PERSON> 's disease.
