 Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type II ( PGA-II ) is a rare immunoendocrinopathy syndrome characterized by the occurrence of autoimmune Addison<PERSON> disease along with diabetes mellitus type 1 and/or autoimmune thyroid disease. Here, we report the case of a 23-year-old female with PGA-II who was followed up at the dermatology and endocrinology clinics of the Universidade<ORGANIZATION> Federal do Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro<PERSON>, located in the state of Minas Gerais<PERSON>, Brazil<GPE>. First, the patient presented diffuse skin hyperpigmentation, vitiligo ; and in sequence, due to vomiting, appetite and weight loss, hypoglycemia, amenorrhea, and galactorrhea, the patient was then diagnosed with PGA-II. The patient also presented intense hyperprolactinemia due to primary hypothyroidism. The late diagnosis of PGA-II is frequent because the disorder is uncommon and has non-specific clinical manifestations. This report emphasizes the significance of a timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases, especially Addison<PERSON> disease. The present study reports a rare case of a patient with PGA-II with primary amenorrhea associated with hyperprolactinemia.
