 Psychiatric<GPE> patients have a greater risk of premature mortality, predominantly due to cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs<ORGANIZATION> ). Convincing evidence shows that psychiatric conditions are characterized by an increased risk of metabolic syndrome ( MetS<ORGANIZATION> ), a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors including dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. This increased risk is present for a range of psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder ( MDD<ORGANIZATION> ), bipolar disorder ( BD ), schizophrenia, anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD<ORGANIZATION> ), and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD<ORGANIZATION> ). There is some evidence for a dose-response association with the severity and duration of symptoms and for a bidirectional longitudinal impact between psychiatric disorders and MetS<ORGANIZATION>. Associations generally seem stronger with abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia dysregulations than with hypertension. Contributing mechanisms are an unhealthy lifestyle and a poor adherence to medical regimen, which are prevalent among psychiatric patients. Specific psychotropic medications have also shown a profound impact in increasing MetS<ORGANIZATION> dysregulations. Finally, pleiotropy in genetic vulnerability and pathophysiological mechanisms, such as those leading to the increased central and peripheral activation of immunometabolic or endocrine systems, plays a role in both MetS<ORGANIZATION> and psychiatric disorder development. The excess risk of MetS<ORGANIZATION> and its unfavorable somatic health consequences justifies a high priority for future research, prevention, close monitoring, and treatment to reduce MetS<ORGANIZATION> in the vulnerable psychiatric patient.
