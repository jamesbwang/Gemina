 To investigate the expression of long non-coding RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> ) DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> in colon cancer, and the relationship between its expression and disease occurrence. Human<PERSON> colon cancer tissues and para-carcinoma tissues were harvested. The expression of lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> was measured by semi-quantitative PCR<ORGANIZATION>. The expression of DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> in HT-29 colon cancer cells was downregulated using siRNA<ORGANIZATION>, and the effect of its downregulation on cell growth was determined by MTT<ORGANIZATION> assay and plate clone assay. The effect of DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> downregulation on colon cancer cell migration was determined using a transwell assay and scratch wound assay. The effect of DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> on colon cancer cell apoptosis was determined using Annexin<PERSON> V/PI double-staining. The changes in p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-p38 were measured by Western<GPE> blot. HT-29 cells with downregulated DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> expression were used to establish the subcutaneous heterotopic transplantation tumor model in nude mice to study the effect of DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> on tumor growth in animals. Compared with para-carcinoma tissue, lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> in colon cancer tissue was highly expressed ( p < 0.001 ). Downregulating lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> in HT-29 cells showed that lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> promotes cell proliferation and migration, and suppresses apoptosis ( p < 0.05 ). The effect of lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> on the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway was evaluated. The expression of p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-p38 was increased significantly compared with the control group ( p < 0.01 ). The effect of downregulating DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> on tumor growth in animals showed that tumor growth in nude mice was decreased, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins was increased ( p < 0.01 ). The expression of lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> is elevated in colon cancer tissues ; lncRNA DMTF1v4<ORGANIZATION> promotes colon cancer cell proliferation and migration, and inhibits apoptosis by downregulating the expression of p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-p38, thus affecting the progression of colon cancer. This will provide a basis for the development of new clinical treatments for colon cancer.
