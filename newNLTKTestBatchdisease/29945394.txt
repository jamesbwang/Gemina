 The loss of hippocampal neurons is one of the main pathological features of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ), which is related to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Huangpu Tongqiao<PERSON> capsule is used for the treatment of AD<ORGANIZATION>, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. This study is to investigate the mechanism of neuroprotective effect of Huangpu Tongqiao<PERSON> capsule in the treatment of AD<ORGANIZATION>, through observing the effect of Huangpu Tongqiao<PERSON> capsule containing serum on cell injury of primary cultured hippocampal neurons induced by Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ via inhibiting the cell apoptosis. Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were cultured and identified by MAP-2 immunofluorescence staining, and cell growth state was observed by inverted microscope. The Huangpu Tongqiao<ORGANIZATION> capsule containing serum was prepared using the method of serum pharmacology. MTT<ORGANIZATION> assays were used to measure the optimum concentration range of Huangpu Tongqiao<PERSON> capsule containing serum, and optimum Aβ concentration for establishing the AD<ORGANIZATION> model. After primary cultured hippocampal neurons AD cell model was induced by Aβ₂₅₋₃₅, cell survival rate was detected by MTT<ORGANIZATION>, cell apoptosis rate was assayed by flow cytometry, and protein expressions of Bax<GPE>, Cyt C<PERSON> and caspase-3 were determined by Western<GPE> blot analysis. The results showed that the primary cultured hippocampal neurons were cultured successfully, and cells grew mature at seventh days ; Compared with normal group, the survival rate of hippocampal neurons in AD<GPE> cell model group was decreased, the apoptosis rate of hippocampal neurons was increased, and the protein expressions of Bax<GPE>, Cyt C<PERSON> and caspase-3 were increased (
