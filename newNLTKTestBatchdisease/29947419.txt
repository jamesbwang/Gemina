 Current research highlights a need to investigate the factors affecting periodontal disease referral. Limited literature exists on periodontal disease referral in Australia<GPE> and no comparison to the periodontal disease referral guidelines exists. This study analyses the factors affecting periodontal disease referral and the adherence to guidelines in general dentists in Queensland<GPE>, Australia<GPE>. 57 general dentists who are members of the Australian<GPE> Dental Association<ORGANIZATION> ( Queensland<GPE> ) undertook an online survey. The disease factor regarded as most important ( 90 % of respondents ) was unresolved inflammation upon re-evaluation. The non-disease factor regarded as most important ( 79 % of respondents ) was the operator 's level of training. There is low awareness of the guidelines ( 36.7 % ) yet a reasonable adherence to them ( 78.3 % ). Of those aware of the guidelines, there was a statistically significant poorer adherence to the guidelines compared to those unaware ( p=0.036 ), while there is no significant difference in the adherence to guidelines between those who have and those who have not attended CPD<ORGANIZATION> courses ( p=0.66 ). Adherence to current guidelines is not significantly impacted by the level of awareness of the guidelines or CPD<ORGANIZATION> attendance. The results from this study suggest a need to refine the current guidelines to better inform decisions about periodontal disease referrals. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
