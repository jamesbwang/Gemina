 In several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer<PERSON> 's disease ( AD ), microglia are hyperactivated and release nitric oxide ( NO<ORGANIZATION> ) and proinflammatory cytokines, resulting its neuropathology. Mounting evidence indicates that dietary supplementation with coconut oil ( CNO<ORGANIZATION> ) reduces the cognitive deficits associated with AD<ORGANIZATION> ; however, the precise mechanism ( s ) underlying the beneficial effect of CNO<ORGANIZATION> are unknown. In the present study, we examined the effects of lauric acid ( LA<ORGANIZATION> ), a major constituent of CNO<ORGANIZATION>, on microglia activated experimentally by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION> ), using primary cultured rat microglia and the mouse microglial cell line, BV-2. LA attenuated LPS-stimulated NO<ORGANIZATION> production and the expression of inducible NO<ORGANIZATION> synthase protein without affecting cell viability. In addition, LA<ORGANIZATION> suppressed LPS-induced reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokine production, as well as phosphorylation of p38-mitogen activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. LA-induced suppression of NO<ORGANIZATION> production was partially but significantly reversed in the presence of GW1100<ORGANIZATION>, an antagonist of G protein-coupled receptor ( GPR<ORGANIZATION> ) 40, which is an LA receptor on the plasma membrane. LA also decreased LPS-induced phagocytosis, which was completely reversed by co-treatment with GW1100<ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, LA<ORGANIZATION> alleviated amyloid-Î²-induced enhancement of phagocytosis. These results suggest that attenuation of microglial activation by LA<ORGANIZATION> may occur via the GPR40-dependent pathway. Such effects of LA<ORGANIZATION> may reduce glial activation and the subsequent neuronal damage in AD patients who consume CNO<ORGANIZATION>.
