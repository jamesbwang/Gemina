 Redox<GPE> signaling plays a vital role in regulating various cellular signaling pathways and disease biology. Recently, nanomedicine ( application of nanotechnology in biology and medicine ) has been demonstrated to regulate angiogenesis through redox signaling. A complete understanding of redox signaling pathways influenced angiogenesis/ anti-angiogenesis triggered by therapeutic nanoparticles is extensively reviewed in this article. Recent Advances: In recent times, nanomedicines are regarded as the trojan horses that could be employed for successful drug delivery, gene delivery, peptide delivery, disease diagnosis etc conquering barriers associated with conventional theranostic approaches. Physiological angiogenesis is a tightly regulated process maintaining a balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. The redox signaling is one of the main factors that contribute to this physiological balance. An aberrant redox signaling cascade can be caused by several exogenous and endogenous factors, and leads to reduced or augmented angiogenesis that ultimately results in several disease conditions. Redox signaling based nanomedicine approach has emerged as a new platform for angiogenesis related disease therapy, where nanoparticles promote angiogenesis via controlled ROS<ORGANIZATION> production and anti-angiogenesis by triggering excessive ROS<ORGANIZATION> formation. Recently investigators have identified different efficient nano-candidates, which modulate angiogenesis by controlling intracellular redox molecules. Considering the importance of angiogenesis in healthcare, a thorough understanding of nanomedicine regulated redox signaling would inspire researchers to design and develop more novel nanomaterials that could be employed as an alternative strategy for the treatment of various diseases, where angiogenesis plays a vital role.
