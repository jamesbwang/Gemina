 Smoking<GPE> is a major risk factor driving the tuberculosis ( TB ) epidemic and smokers ' alveolar macrophages ( AM<ORGANIZATION> ) demonstrate significant immune defects following infection. Recently, macrophage glycolytic reprogramming has emerged as crucial in the early host immune response to Mycobacterium<GPE> tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection. To compare baseline metabolic characteristics and the glycolytic response to infection of human AM from smokers and non-smokers. AM were obtained at bronchoscopy and extracellular flux analyses performed to determine baseline metabolic characteristics compared to human monocyte derived macrophages ( MDM<ORGANIZATION> ). Metabolic<ORGANIZATION> characterisation of AM from smokers and non-smokers was performed similarly. Following infection with Mtb<PERSON>, differences in glycolytic response were measured by extracellular flux analyses and gene expression analyses, and correlated with production of the glycolysis-driven IL-1Î² and PGE2<ORGANIZATION>. Similar experiments were performed in cigarette smoke extract ( CSE<ORGANIZATION> ) -treated MDM<ORGANIZATION> as an alternative model. At baseline, human AM from non-smokers have a significantly lower ECAR/OCR ratio than MDM<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.05 ), but retain substantial glycolytic reserve. Compared to non-smokers, smokers ' AM demonstrate reduced metabolic activity, reduced glycolytic reserve ( p=0.051 ) and reduced spare respiratory capacity ( p < 0.01 ). Following infection with Mtb<PERSON>, smokers ' AM have significantly reduced glycolytic response, as measured by extracellular flux analyses ( p < 0.05 ) and glycolytic gene expression analyses. CSE-treated MDM<ORGANIZATION> similarly demonstrate reduced metabolic activity and reserves, and impaired glycolytic response to infection. Human AM<PERSON> demonstrate metabolic plasticity that allows glycolytic reprogramming to occur following Mtb<PERSON> infection. In smokers, this metabolic reserve is significantly attenuated, with consequent impairment of the glycolytic response to infection.
