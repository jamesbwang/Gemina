 The cattle industry is one of the most important Brazilian<GPE> agribusiness sectors and is a strong contributor to the national economy. Annually about 44.6 million calves are bred, which makes the optimal management of these animals extremely important. Several diseases can affect the initial stages of the bovine production chain, being the bovine respiratory syncytial virus ( BRSV<ORGANIZATION> ) one of the most relevant pathogens. This study aimed to characterize the epidemiology of BRSV<ORGANIZATION> infection in dairy cattle herds of SÃ£o Paulo State<ORGANIZATION>, Brazil<GPE>, using serological and risk factors analyses. For that, 1243 blood samples were collected of animals from 26 farms and a questionnaire about possible risk factors for BRSV<ORGANIZATION> prevalence was performed. The obtained blood sera were analyzed using virus neutralization test ( VNT<ORGANIZATION> ). VNT<ORGANIZATION> results showed high BRSV<ORGANIZATION> prevalence in dairy cattle herds, reaching 79.5 % of seropositivity. The BRSV<ORGANIZATION> seroprevalence among studied farms ranged from 40 to 100 %. The analysis of risk factors indicated that the age group and the occurrence of coinfection with bovine herpesvirus 1 ( BoHV-1 ) and bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 ( BVDV-1 ) should be associated with a higher prevalence of BRSV<ORGANIZATION>, while natural suckling was considered a protective factor. The study showed that adult animals over 1 year old are an important risk factor for the high seroprevalence of BRSV<ORGANIZATION> in herds. The high BRSV<ORGANIZATION> prevalence associated with BoHV-1 and BVDV-1 suggests that biosecurity measures should be applied in order to reduce viral dissemination. Additionally, the natural suckling may be an important management to protect calves from high BRSV<ORGANIZATION> seroprevalence.
