 A high incidence of intentional or accidental paraquat ( PQ ) ingestion is related to irreversible lung fibrosis and no effective therapy is currently available. Vitamin D<PERSON> has emerged with promising results as an immunomodulatory molecule when abrogating the inflammatory responses of lung diseases. Therefore, we have investigated the role of vitamin D treatments on PQ-induced lung fibrosis in male C57/BL6 mice. Lung<PERSON> fibrosis was induced by a single injection of PQ<GPE> ( 10 mg/kg ; i.p. ). The control group received PQ vehicle. Seven days later, after the PQ<ORGANIZATION> injection or the vehicle injection, the mice received vitamin D ( 5 Î¼g/kg, i.p., once a day ) or vehicle, for a further 7 days. Twenty-four hours after the last dose of vitamin D or the vehicle, the analysis were performed. The vitamin D treatments reduced the number of leukocytes in their BALF<ORGANIZATION> and they decreased the IL-6, IL-17, TGF-beta and MMP-9 levels and the abrogated collagenase deposits in their lung tissues. Conversely, the vitamin D treatments increased the resolvin D levels in their BALF<ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, their tracheal contractility was also significantly reduced by the vitamin D treatments. Altogether, the data that was obtained showed a promising use of vitamin D, in treating the lung fibrosis that had been induced by the PQ<ORGANIZATION> intoxications. This may improve its prognostic use for a non-invasive and low cost therapy.
