 Disturbed<GPE> permanent tooth eruption is common in cleidocranial dysplasia ( CCD<ORGANIZATION> ), a skeletal disorder caused by heterozygous mutation of RUNX2<ORGANIZATION>, but the mechanism underlying is still unclear. As it is well known that dental follicle cells ( DFCs<ORGANIZATION> ) play a critical role in tooth eruption, the changed biological characteristics of DFCs<ORGANIZATION> might give rise to disturbance of permanent tooth eruption in CCD<ORGANIZATION> patients. Thus, primary DFCs from one CCD patient and normal controls were collected to investigate the effect of RUNX2<ORGANIZATION> mutation on the bone remodeling activity of DFCs<ORGANIZATION> and explore the mechanism of impaired permanent tooth eruption in this disease. Conservation and secondary structure analysis revealed that the RUNX2<ORGANIZATION> mutation ( c.514delT, p.172fs ) found in the present CCD<ORGANIZATION> patient was located in the highly conserved RUNT<ORGANIZATION> domain and converted the structure of RUNX2<ORGANIZATION>. After osteogenic induction, we found that the mineralised capacity of DFCs<ORGANIZATION> and the expression of osteoblast-related genes, including RUNX2<ORGANIZATION>, ALP<ORGANIZATION>, OSX<ORGANIZATION>, OCN<ORGANIZATION> and Col IÎ±1<PERSON>, in DFCs<ORGANIZATION> was severely interfered by the RUNX2<ORGANIZATION> mutation found in CCD<ORGANIZATION> patients. To investigate whether the osteogenic deficiency of DFCs<ORGANIZATION> from the CCD<ORGANIZATION> patient can be rescued by RUNX2<ORGANIZATION> restoration, we performed 'rescue ' experiments. Surprisingly, the osteogenic deficiency and the abnormal expression of osteoblast-associated genes in DFCs<ORGANIZATION> from the CCD<ORGANIZATION> patient were almost rescued by overexpression of wild-type RUNX2 using lentivirus. All these findings indicate that RUNX2<ORGANIZATION> mutation can reduce the osteogenic capacity of DFCs<ORGANIZATION> through inhibiting osteoblast-associated genes, thereby disturbing alveolar bone formation, which serves as a motive force for tooth eruption. This effect may provide valuable explanations and implications for the mechanism of delayed permanent tooth eruption in CCD<ORGANIZATION> patients.
