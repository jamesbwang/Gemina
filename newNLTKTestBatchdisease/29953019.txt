 Late<GPE> referral in chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ) is associated with irregular care and poor prognosis. How the specialty of healthcare provider affect late referral and irregular CKD<ORGANIZATION> care remain unclear.We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study to include incident dialysis patients from 2002 to 2007 in Taiwan<GPE> and observed for 1, 2, and 3 years before dialysis. The medical visits-related information was evaluated every 3 months, retrospectively. Irregular follow-up was defined as missing a follow-up during more than one interval every year.A total of 46,626 patients were included. At 1, 2, and 3 years prior to maintenance dialysis, 87 %, 66 %, and 50 % of patients had regular medical visits ; however, only 49 %, 23 %, and 12 % had estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) regularly monitored, respectively. Independent factors of less regular eGFR<ORGANIZATION> follow-up included age ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 0.995, 95 % confidence interval 0.993-0.998 ), cardiac disorder ( 0.90, 0.82-0.99 ), and stroke ( 0.76, 0.69-0.84 ), as well as regular visits at some other specialties ( adjusted OR range: from 0.77 to 0.88 ) ; whereas, independent factors of less regular visits at nephrology included diabetes mellitus ( 0.48, 0.46-0.51 ), cardiac disorder ( 0.61, 0.56-0.66 ), stroke ( 0.53, 0.48-0.58 ), and regular visits at any other specialty ( adjusted OR range: from 0.22 to 0.78 ) .Regular medical visits were quite common in late CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients, but they received regular eGFR<ORGANIZATION> measurement and visit at nephrology much less frequently. Physicians play a major role in the late referrals in CKD<ORGANIZATION> and its irregular care.
