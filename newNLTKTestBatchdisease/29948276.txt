 To evaluate the treatment of gingival recessions by semilunar coronally positioned flap plus enamel matrix derivative ( SCPF<ORGANIZATION> + EMD ). Thirty patients with class I localized gingival recession were included. They were randomly allocated in two groups: SCPF<ORGANIZATION> + EMD and SCPF<ORGANIZATION>. Recession height ( RH ), recession width ( RW ), width of keratinized tissue ( WKT<ORGANIZATION> ), thickness of keratinized tissue ( TKT<ORGANIZATION> ), probing depth ( PD ), and clinical attachment level ( CAL<ORGANIZATION> ) were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months post-surgery. Patient/professional evaluation of esthetics and root sensitivity was performed. After 12 months, mean root coverage was 1.98 ± 0.33 mm for SCPF<ORGANIZATION> + EMD ( 90.86 ± 14.69 % ) and 1.85 ± 0.41 mm ( 79.76 ± 17.44 % ) for SCPF<ORGANIZATION> ( p > 0.05 ). The esthetic evaluation by the patient showed preference for SCPF<ORGANIZATION> + EMD. According to the professional evaluation ( QCE<ORGANIZATION> ), the use of EMD<ORGANIZATION> decreases the appearance of postoperative scar tissue line. There was a significant reduction in root hypersensitivity with no further complaints by the patients. The addition of EMD<ORGANIZATION> provides significantly better esthetics to SCPF<ORGANIZATION>, according to patient and professional assessments. SCPF<ORGANIZATION> + EMD<ORGANIZATION> is effective but not superior to SCPF<ORGANIZATION> for root coverage, after 12 months. Previous clinical trials showed that the combination of EMD<ORGANIZATION> with coronally advanced flaps may enhance the outcome of root coverage. There is a lack of studies testing the combination of EMD<ORGANIZATION> with SCPF<ORGANIZATION>. The combination SCPF<ORGANIZATION> + EMD<ORGANIZATION> provides better esthetics when compared to the SCPF<ORGANIZATION> and is effective, but not superior, to SCPF<ORGANIZATION> for root coverage, after 12 months.
