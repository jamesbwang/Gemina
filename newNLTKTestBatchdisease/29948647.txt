 Epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT<ORGANIZATION> ) describes the shift of cells from an epithelial form to a contact independent, migratory, mesenchymal form. In cancer the change is linked to invasion and metastasis. Tumour conditions, including hypoxia, acidosis and a range of treatments can trigger EMT<ORGANIZATION>, which is implicated in the subsequent development of resistance to those same treatments. Consequently, the degree to which EMT<ORGANIZATION> occurs may underpin the entire course of tumour progression and treatment response in a patient. In this review we look past the protective effect of EMT<ORGANIZATION> against the initial treatment, to the role of the mesenchymal state, once triggered, in promoting disease growth, spread and future treatment insensitivity. In patients a correlation was found between the propensity of a treatment to induce EMT<ORGANIZATION> and failure of that treatment to provide a survival benefit, implicating EMT<ORGANIZATION> induction in accelerated tumour progression after treatment cessation. Looking to the mechanisms driving this detrimental effect ; increased proliferation, suppressed apoptosis, stem cell induction, augmented angiogenesis, enhanced metastatic dissemination, and immune tolerance, can all result from treatment-induced EMT<ORGANIZATION> and could worsen outcome. Evidence<PERSON> also suggests EMT<ORGANIZATION> induction with earlier therapies attenuates benefits of later treatments. Looking beyond epithelial tumours, de-differentiation also has therapy-attenuating effects and reversal thereof may yield similar rewards. A range of potential therapies are in development that may address the diverse mechanisms and molecular control systems involved in EMT-induced accelerated progression. Considering the broad reaching effects of mesenchymal shift identified, successful deployment of such treatments could substantially improve patient outcomes.
