 Cardiac<GPE> imaging by means of myocardial Positron Emission<PERSON> Tomography/Computed Tomography ( PET/CT ) is being used increasingly to assess coronary artery disease, to guide revascularization decisions with more accuracy, and it allows robust quantitative analysis of both regional myocardial blood flow ( MBF<ORGANIZATION> ) and myocardial flow reserve ( MFR<ORGANIZATION> ) .Recently, a more time-efficient protocol has been developed in combination with a residual activity correction algorithm in which a stress acquisition is performed directly after completion of the rest acquisition to subtract remaining myocardial radioactivity.The objective of this study is to define flow values of myocardial blood flow ( MBF<ORGANIZATION> ) and Myocardial Flow Reserve<ORGANIZATION> ( MFR<ORGANIZATION> ) with A mean MBF in rest of 1.02 ± 0.22 ml/g/min, a mean MBF in stress of 2.54 ± 0.41 ml/g/min with a mean MFR<ORGANIZATION> of 2.60 ± 0.61 were measured. Female patients had a significant higher MBF in rest and stress, but lower MFR<ORGANIZATION> ; a small but significant negative correlation was measured between age and MBF<ORGANIZATION> in stress and MFR<ORGANIZATION>. Residual activity correction had a significant effect resulting in a difference in global stress MBF<ORGANIZATION> before and after correction of 0.39 ± 0.13 ml/g/min. This study established flow values for
