 To determine the diagnostic performance of macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer ( GCIPL<ORGANIZATION> ) thickness measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) for glaucoma detection in a Chinese<GPE> population in comparison with optic nerve head ( ONH<ORGANIZATION> ) and retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL<ORGANIZATION> ) parameters measured by both SD-OCT and Heidelberg Retina<PERSON> Tomography 3 ( HRT-3 ). Adults<PERSON> aged 40 to 80 years were recruited from the population-based study ( n = 3353, response rate 72.8 % ). Macular<PERSON> cube 200x200 scan was performed with Cirrus<PERSON> SD-OCT ( version 6.0, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc<PERSON>, Dublin<GPE>, CA ) for GCIPL<ORGANIZATION> thickness measurement. ONH<ORGANIZATION> and RNFL<ORGANIZATION> imaging was performed with Cirrus<PERSON> SD-OCT and HRT-3 ( Heidelberg Engineering<ORGANIZATION>, Heidelberg<PERSON>, Germany<GPE> ). Glaucoma<PERSON> was defined according to International Society<ORGANIZATION> for Geographical<ORGANIZATION> and Epidemiological Ophthalmology<ORGANIZATION> criteria. In total, 86 eyes of 60 subjects with glaucoma and 1709 eyes of 1001 non-glaucoma participants were included. The best performing parameters for Cirrus<PERSON> SD-OCT GCIPL, Cirrus<PERSON> SD-OCT ONH and HRT-3 were minimum GCIPL<ORGANIZATION> thickness ( Area<ORGANIZATION> under receiver-operating curve [ AUC ] = 0.89, 95 % CI 0.83-0.95 ), vertical cup-disc ratio ( CDR<ORGANIZATION> ) ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> = 0.94, 0.91-0.98 ) and vertical CDR<ORGANIZATION> ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> = 0.86, 0.81-0.92 ), respectively. At 85 % specificity, vertical CDR<ORGANIZATION> measured using Cirrus OCT<PERSON> ONH scan showed the highest sensitivity ( 88.64 %, 95 % CI 75.4-96.2 ) compared to minimum GCIPL<ORGANIZATION> thickness with sensitivity of 60.53 % ( 95 % CI 46.4-73.0 ) ( p < 0.001 ). Inferior RNFL<PERSON> thickness ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> = 0.84, 95 % CI 0.91-0.97 ) measured by Cirrus SD-OCT<PERSON> was also superior to Cirrus<PERSON> SD-OCT GCIPL ( p < 0.007 ). The diagnostic performance of macular GCIPL<ORGANIZATION> scan is inferior compared to vertical CDR<ORGANIZATION> measured by Cirrus OCT<PERSON> ONH scan. Cirrus OCT<PERSON> ONH scan showed the best ability in detecting glaucoma in a Chinese<GPE> population, suggesting it could be a good glaucoma screening tool in an Asian<GPE> population.
