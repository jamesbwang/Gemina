 Lumpy<GPE> skin disease ( LSD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a devastating viral disease of cattle which has recently spread from Africa<GPE> into the countries of the Middle East<GPE>. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships among lumpy skin disease viruses ( LSDV<ORGANIZATION> ) isolated from different regions of Iran<GPE> and the origin and spread of these viruses. In this study, a total of 234 blood samples from clinically affected animals from four provinces in the northwest of Iran<GPE> were screened for LSDV<ORGANIZATION> using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR<ORGANIZATION> ). From 80 positive samples for LSDV<ORGANIZATION> detected by PCR<ORGANIZATION>, the partial P32 gene ( 759 bp ) of 12 isolates were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. LSD viruses were grouped in three subclusters with an overall 97.1-100 % nucleotide identity. LSDVs<ORGANIZATION> isolated from Gilan<PERSON> showed lowest nucleotide identity with the other LSDVs<ORGANIZATION>. Four isolates of LSDV<ORGANIZATION> including KO-1, EA-1, EA-3, and WA-3 showed 100 % similarity with each other and also with the Neethling strain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the identified LSDVs were closely related to each other and had high-sequence homology with other LSDV<ORGANIZATION> isolates from Africa<GPE>. It was concluded that LSD<ORGANIZATION> outbreak probably occurred in the northwest of Iran<GPE> by LSDVs<ORGANIZATION> entering the country from Iraq<GPE> and P32<PERSON> nucleotide sequence information obtained in the present study is a valuable resource in understanding the genetic nature and molecular epidemiology of local LSDV<ORGANIZATION> isolates which can be used for future vaccine development based on the circulating strains in the region.
