 The most widely used type II pyrethroid is β-cypermethrin ( β-CYP ), and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid ( 3-PBA ) is one of its primary metabolites. Although CYP<ORGANIZATION> has been shown to pose toxic effects in some immune cells, as of now the immunotoxicity of CYP<ORGANIZATION> on immune progenitor cells has not been well studied. In this study, we evaluated the immunotoxicity of β-CYP and 3-PBA on the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60. Both β-CYP and 3-PBA reduced cell viability. In addition, both β-CYP and 3-PBA stimulated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while only β-CYP induced cell cycle arrest in G1<GPE> stage. Moreover, exposure to β-CYP and 3-PBA at 100 μM inhibited all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expressions of the granulocytic differentiation-related genes, CD11b<ORGANIZATION> and CSF-3R. Furthermore, exposure to β-CYP and 3-PBA resulted in a downregulation of the granulocytic differentiation promoting transcriptional factors, PU.1 and C/EBPε. Furthermore, we found that β-CYP and 3-PBA exposure led to elevated levels of cellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ), and that pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine ( NAC<ORGANIZATION> ) blocked the toxic effects caused by β-CYP and 3-PBA. The results obtained in the present study provide evidence showing the immunotoxic effects of β-CYP and 3-PBA on promyelocytic cells as well as its possible underlying mechanism.
