 Paraquat<GPE> can cause severe injury to vascular endothelial cells and lead to coagulation dysfunction when it is taken into the blood by oral ingestion. In this study, we aim to find a routine coagulation index to serve as an indicator of outcome in patients with acute paraquat poisoning. Between<PERSON> January 2012 and December 2016, 209 patients who attempted suicide by oral ingestion of paraquat were admitted to the emergency room. Routine<PERSON> coagulation indices, including plasma prothrombin time ( PT ), activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT<ORGANIZATION> ), fibrinogen ( Fbg ), thrombin time ( TT ), and D-dimer were measured to analyze the trend of changes and their relationship with prognosis. The results showed that the PT<ORGANIZATION> and APTT<ORGANIZATION> values in the ≥30 mL group were significantly greater than those in the < 30 mL group ( both P < .01 ). Within 1 week of admission, PT<ORGANIZATION> and APTT<ORGANIZATION> values gradually decreased, while Fbg<ORGANIZATION> levels gradually increased. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> and multivariate Cox<PERSON> regression analysis indicated that sex, ingestion volume, and PT were independent predictors of mortality within 40 days. The cumulative survival rates differed significantly ( P<PERSON> = .001 ) between patients with PT<ORGANIZATION> < 12 seconds and PT<ORGANIZATION> ≥12 seconds. Coagulation status in patients with PQ<ORGANIZATION> poisoning was closely related to prognosis. Routine<PERSON> monitoring of coagulation function, particularly PT in plasma, is helpful for analysis of the condition and prognosis of patients with PQ<ORGANIZATION> poisoning.
