 Cardiac<GPE> fibrosis is one of the most important underlying causes of several cardiac diseases. The role of calreticulin ( CRT<ORGANIZATION> ) in cardiac diseases has already been established. The overor under-expression of CRT<ORGANIZATION> can lead to cardiac diseases. This study was aimed to explore the effect of CRT<ORGANIZATION> on cardiac fibrosis and also to investigate the possible underlying molecular mechanism. Human<PERSON> cardiac fibroblast cells ( HCF<ORGANIZATION> ) were used in the experiment. The cells were transfected with the CRT<ORGANIZATION> expression vector constructed by sub-cloning the full-length wild-type CRT coding sequence into pcDNA3.1 ( pc-CRT group ), empty construct pcDNA3.1 ( pcDNA3.1 group ), CRT-specific siRNA ( si-CRT ), and si-NC ( negative control ). The Cell<ORGANIZATION> Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay, apoptosis assay and invasion assay were performed. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT<ORGANIZATION> PCR ) and western blot analysis were performed to measure the expressions of different mRNAs<ORGANIZATION> and proteins. The CRT<ORGANIZATION> expression was significantly increased ( p < 0.01 ) and decreased ( p < 0.01 ) in the pc-CRT and si-CRT groups, respectively. The CRT<ORGANIZATION> over-expression led to increased cell viability and invasiveness ( p < 0.05 ) and a decreased percentage of apoptotic cells. The over-expression of CRT<ORGANIZATION> led to a significant increase in the expressions of collagen ( I and III<ORGANIZATION> ) ( p < 0.01 ) and matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP-2 and 9 ) ( p < 0.05 ). The Notch<GPE> pathway was also significantly activated ( p < 0.05 ) by the over-expression of CRT<ORGANIZATION> and vice versa when suppressed. The results showed that the CRT<ORGANIZATION> over-expression was associated with increased cell viability and invasiveness and decreased apoptosis, and the activation of the Notch<GPE> pathway in HCF<ORGANIZATION>, which suggests its possible implication in CRT-induced cardiac fibrosis.
