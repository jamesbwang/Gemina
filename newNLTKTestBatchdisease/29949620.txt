 The current study examined micro RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) clusters from the maternal plasma to determine their association with preterm birth ( PTB<ORGANIZATION> ) and infant birth outcomes. A subsample of 42 participants who spontaneously delivered either preterm ( â‰¤37 weeks ) or term was selected from a parent sample of 515 pregnant Mexican<GPE> American<GPE> women. Plasma samples and prenatal data were collected at a single mid-gestation time point ( 22-24 weeks ' gestation ) and birth outcomes were obtained from medical records after delivery. Circulating miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> were analyzed by qPCR<ORGANIZATION>. When miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> were grouped according to chromosomal cluster rather than expression level, individual miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> correlated strongly with other individual miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> within their respective genomic locus. miRNAs from the c19mc cluster negatively correlated with c14mc miRNAs<ORGANIZATION>, and this relationship was more pronounced in PTB<ORGANIZATION>. Clusters c14mc was negatively associated with length of gestation ; while the c19mc was positively associated with length of gestation and infant head circumference. Together, these findings suggest that groups of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> from common chromosomal clusters, rather than individual miRNAs<ORGANIZATION>, operate as co-regulated groups of signaling molecules to coordinate length of gestation and infant outcomes. From this evidence, differences in cluster-wide expression of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> are involved in spontaneous PTB<ORGANIZATION>.
