 Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome is a rare and probably underdiagnosed condition. Renal<PERSON> and ocular manifestations may not occur simultaneously, making the diagnosis more difficult. Nephritis<PERSON> may be asymptomatic ; therefore, renal function evaluation is essential for diagnosis. Urinary Î²2-microglobulin levels may be particularly useful. Uveitis<PERSON>, mostly anterior, nongranulomatous and bilateral, occurs usually after the onset of nephritis. Treatment includes corticosteroids and, eventually, other immunosuppressant agents. Renal disease is usually benign and resolves spontaneously or after treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Uveitis<PERSON>, however, may be chronic or recurrent. The authors described the cases of three pediatric patients diagnosed with tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome. The goal of this paper was to warn the medical community over the need to screen patients with uveitis for renal disease.
