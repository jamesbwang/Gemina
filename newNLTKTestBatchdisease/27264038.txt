 The study was undertaken to determine the Rhesus<ORGANIZATION> blood group system and Rhesus<PERSON> haplotype frequencies among blood donors at Mbarara Regional Blood Bank<FACILITY>. We included ethylene-diaminetetra-acetic acid-containing plasma samples and serum samples from recruited consented blood donors. The Rh blood group system and the Rh haplotypes was established by the incubation of appropriate antisera ( anti-D, anti-E, anti-C, anti-e, and anti-c ) and cells at a temperature of 24Â°C in microplates for 1 hour and the reaction was read by gentle shaking and examining for agglutinations. Donors were asked to fill in questionnaires, after we obtained the informed consent, to assess their demographics. Among the 386 participants, 233 were males ( 60 % ) and 153 ( 40 % ) females. The Rh negative blood group percentage was 3.8 %, while the Rh haplotype frequencies were as follows: D Given this frequency, a high prevalence of anti-D alloantibody formation among those transfused is possible and could cause diverse effects, especially in the Rh D positive women. We recommend additional research studies on the role of autoimmunity to the transfused on the occurrence of Rh D variants plus their implications on hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn in Uganda<GSP>. This study recommends that the blood bank includes Rhesus<PERSON> haplotyping in its protocols and that the finding be disseminated to donors and blood users.
