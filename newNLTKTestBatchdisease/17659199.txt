 The use of coronary computed tomography angiography ( CCTA<ORGANIZATION> ) for noninvasive anatomic detection of coronary artery disease is increasing. Recently, fractional flow reserve ( FFR<ORGANIZATION> ) assessment using routinely acquired CCTA<ORGANIZATION> datasets ( FFR<ORGANIZATION> This prospective, multicenter, observational trial evaluated changes in coronary atherosclerosis after alogliptin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Fifty-one patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent CCTA<ORGANIZATION> examination and having intermediate coronary artery stenosis were treated with 25 mg of alogliptin. After 48 weeks, CCTA<ORGANIZATION> examination was repeated. The primary endpoint was changes in FFR The FFR<ORGANIZATION> In Japanese<GPE> patients with diabetes and intermediate coronary artery stenosis, alogliptin could not improve FFR<ORGANIZATION>
