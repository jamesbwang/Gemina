 Fornier gangrene is an extremely rare disease of the genitals. This disease is a result of the urogenital tract, anorectal area, and genital skin infections, appearing usually in immunocompromised patients with diabetes, obesity, and malignant neoplasms. The basic treatment of Fournier<GPE> gangrene includes an emergency surgical intervention combined with antibiotic therapy and detoxification. A review of recent papers comprising studies and reviews published in 2005-2016 was performed. The clinical cases were studied at the Department<ORGANIZATION> of Purulent Surgery Central Clinical Hospital No<ORGANIZATION>. 1, where 7 patients were diagnosed and treated. The etiology, pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of Fournier<GPE> gangrene are described in this article. The authors have described several clinical cases of patients with Fournier<PERSON> gangrene and with necrotic cellulitis and fasciomyositis of anterior abdominal wall, which is a manifestation of Fournier<GPE> gangrene. Making allowance for the unfavorable epidemiological situation of syphilis in Russia<GPE>, the increase in the incidence of complicated, atypical chancre, and therefore, the need for differentiation of Fournier<GPE> gangrene with such manifestations of syphilis as necrotizing, esthiomenous chancre, indurative edema, the appropriate clinical examples are well explained in this article.
