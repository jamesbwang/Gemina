 Glioblastoma<GPE> multiforme ( GBM<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most common and aggressive malignant glioma, with patients having a median survival of just over one year. Current chemotherapies, with surgery and radiotherapy, provide only minor patient benefit. There is a great need to discover and develop novel therapies for this devastating disease. Areas Covered: The patent literature reveals novel therapies, providing insights into emerging GBM<ORGANIZATION> therapeutics. We have used the Google<ORGANIZATION> and USPTO<ORGANIZATION> patent databases to generate a detailed landscape of patents and patent applications from companies active in the areas of glioma and/or GBM<ORGANIZATION>. Specific patents have been grouped into 6 areas: novel compounds ; treatments and therapeutic targets ; combination therapies ; immunotherapies ; delivery methods ; and biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Expert<PERSON> Opinion: There has been a steady increase in the number of patents on GBM<ORGANIZATION> over the last five years. Despite many new compounds being developed and patented for a broad range of cancers, only a small percentage of these are specifically targeted to GBM<ORGANIZATION>. Notable trends in the patent literature include both the development of combination therapies to combat the heterogeneous nature of GBM<ORGANIZATION>, and the use of immunotherapies building on the promise of cancer vaccines and CAR<ORGANIZATION> T-cell therapy.
