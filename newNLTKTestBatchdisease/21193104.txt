 Bilateral deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus ( STN-DBS ) has proven effective in improving motor symptoms in Parkinson<GPE> 's disease ( PD ) patients. However, psychiatric changes after surgery are controversial. In this study, we specifically analyzed apathy following bilateral STN-DBS in PD patients using a meta-analysis. Relevant articles utilized for this study were obtained through literature search on PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, ScienceDirect<ORGANIZATION>, and Embase<ORGANIZATION> databases. The articles included were those contained both pre- and postsurgery apathy data acquired using the Starkstein Apathy Scale<FACILITY> or Apathy Evaluation Scale<PERSON> with patient follow-up of at least three months. A total of 9 out of 86 articles were included in our study through this strict screening process. Standardized mean difference ( SMD<ORGANIZATION> ), that is, Cohen<PERSON> 's d, with a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated to show the change. We found a significant difference between the presurgery stage and the postsurgery stage scores ( SMD<ORGANIZATION> = 0.35, 95 % CI: 0.17∼0.52,
