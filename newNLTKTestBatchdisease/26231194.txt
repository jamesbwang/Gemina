 To compare the differences between the Kidney Disease<ORGANIZATION> Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO<ORGANIZATION> ) criteria of the 48-hour window and the 7-day window in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury ( AKI<ORGANIZATION> ) in very elderly patients, as well as the relationship between the 48-hour and 7-day windows for diagnosis and 90-day mortality. We retrospectively enrolled very elderly patients ( â‰¥75 years old ) from the geriatrics department of the Chinese<GPE> PLA General Hospital<ORGANIZATION> between January 2007 and December 2015. AKI patients were divided into 48-hour and 7-day groups by their diagnosis criteria. AKI patients were divided into survivor and nonsurvivor groups by their outcomes within 90 days after diagnosis of AKI<ORGANIZATION>. In total, 652 patients were included in the final analysis. The median age of the cohort was 87 ( 84-91 ) years, the majority ( 623, 95.6 % ) of whom were male. Of the 652 AKI patients, 334 cases ( 51.2 % ) were diagnosed with AKI<ORGANIZATION> by the 48-hour window for diagnosis, while 318 cases ( 48.8 % ) were by the 7-day window for diagnosis. The 90-day mortality was 42.5 % in patients with 48-hour window AKI<ORGANIZATION> and 24.2 % in patients with 7-day window AKI<ORGANIZATION>. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that 90-day mortality was lower in the 7-day window AKI<ORGANIZATION> group than in the 48-hour window AKI<ORGANIZATION> group ( log rank: The 90-day mortality was higher in 48-hour window AKI than in 7-day window AKI in very elderly patients. The 48-hour KDIGO<ORGANIZATION> window definition may be less sensitive. The 48-hour KDIGO<ORGANIZATION> window definition is significantly better correlated with subsequent mortality and is, therefore, still appropriate for clinical use. Finding early, sensitive biomarkers of kidney damage is a future direction of research.
