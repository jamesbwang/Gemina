 In June 2016, we continued surveillance for tick-borne viruses in eastern Kansas following upon a larger surveillance program initiated in 2015 in response to a fatal human case of Bourbon<GPE> virus ( BRBV<ORGANIZATION> ) ( Family<ORGANIZATION> Orthomyxoviridae: Genus Thogotovirus<PERSON> ). In 4 d, we collected 14,193 ticks representing four species from four sites. Amblyomma<PERSON> americanum ( L. ) ( Acari<PERSON>: Ixodidae ) accounted for nearly all ticks collected ( n = 14,116, 99.5 % ), and the only other species identified were Amblyomma<PERSON> maculatum Koch<GPE> ( Acari<PERSON>: Ixodidae ), Dermacentor<GPE> variabilis ( Say ) ( Acari<PERSON>: Ixodidae ) and Ixodes<GPE> scapularis Say<GPE> ( Acari<PERSON>: Ixodidae ). All ticks were tested for both BRBV<ORGANIZATION> and Heartland<GPE> virus ( Family<ORGANIZATION> Bunyaviridae: Genus Phlebovirus<PERSON> ) in 964 pools. Five Heartland<GPE> virus positive tick pools were detected and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR<ORGANIZATION> ( rRT-PCR ), while all pools tested negative for BRBV<ORGANIZATION>. Each Heartland positive pool was composed of 25 A. americanum nymphs with positive pools collected at three different sites in Bourbon County<GPE>. A. americanum is believed to be the primary vector of both Heartland<GPE> and BRBVs<ORGANIZATION> to humans based upon multiple detections of virus in field-collected ticks, its abundance, and its aggressive feeding behavior on mammals including humans. However, it is possible that A. americanum encounters viremic vertebrate hosts of BRBV<ORGANIZATION> less frequently than viremic hosts of Heartland<GPE> virus, or that BRBV<ORGANIZATION> is less efficiently passed among ticks by co-feeding, or less efficiently passed vertically from infected female ticks to their offspring resulting in lower field infection rates.
