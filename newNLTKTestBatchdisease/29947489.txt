 Levofloxacin<GPE>, a fluoroquinolone, is an isomer of ofloxacin with an extensive spectrum of antimicrobial efficacy. In common with other fluoroquinolones, the main pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) index that correlates with its therapeutic efficacy is the area under the plasma time-concentration curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) /the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC<ORGANIZATION> ) ratios. To evaluate the population PK and determine the efficacy of various dosage regimens in achieving the probability of target attainment ( PTA<ORGANIZATION> ) and the cumulative fraction of response ( CFR<ORGANIZATION> ) of oral levofloxacin when prescribed as the switching therapy after intravenous levofloxacin treatment. The PK<ORGANIZATION> studies were conducted in 45 healthy volunteers who received one 500 mg tablet of levofloxacin and PTAs<ORGANIZATION> were determined by using a Monte Carlo<ORGANIZATION> simulation. The dosage regimens were predicted to achieve CFR<ORGANIZATION> greater than or equal to 90 % by referral to the MIC<ORGANIZATION> distributions database of the European Committee<ORGANIZATION> on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. The population PKs<ORGANIZATION> of levofloxacin were ; the volume of distribution ( V ) = 101.71±1.41 L, total clearance ( CL ) = 8.51±1.43 L/hour and the area under the plasma time-concentration curve from 0 to 24 hours ( AUC0-24 ) = 66.19±1.30 mg*hour/L. The predicted CFRs<ORGANIZATION> for a target AUC0-24 /MIC ratio of 30 for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were 83.12 % and 92.63 %, respectively for 500 mg levofloxacin, and 84.96 % and 98.17 %, respectively for 750 mg levofloxacin. The predicted CFRs<ORGANIZATION> for a target AUC0-24 /MIC ratio of 125 for E. coli and Klebsiella<ORGANIZATION> spp. were 84.25 % and 88.81 %, respectively for 500 mg levofloxacin and 86.00 % and 91.34 %, respectively for 750 mg levofloxacin. The population PKs<ORGANIZATION> of levofloxacin in the present study were similar to the values obtained from the previous study. Both 500 mg qd and 750 mg qd of oral levofloxacin dosage regimens had a high probability of achieving optimal impact against S. pneumoniae, but only the 750 mg qd dosage regimen achieved optimal exposure against Klebsiella<GPE> spp.
