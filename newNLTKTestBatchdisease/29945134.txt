 After initial infection, the immune response that serves to restrict the invading pathogen needs to be tightly calibrated in order to avoid collateral immunopathological damage. This calibration is performed by specialized suppressor mechanisms, which are capable of dampening overwhelming or unremitting inflammation in order to prevent tissue damage. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSC<ORGANIZATION> ) are emerging as key players in counter-balancing inflammatory responses and pathogenesis during infection. However, some pathogens are able to exploit the suppressive activities of MDSC<ORGANIZATION> to favor pathogen persistence and chronic infections. In this article, we review the current knowledge about the importance of MDSC<ORGANIZATION> in the context of bacterial, virus, parasites, and fungal infections.
