 Sarcopenia<GPE> may be an indicator of frailty. We used total psoas area index ( TPAI<ORGANIZATION> ) to identify sarcopenia and evaluated the effect of preoperative TPAI<ORGANIZATION> on outcomes following descending thoracic aortic aneurysm ( DTAA<ORGANIZATION> ) repair. DTAA<ORGANIZATION> patients between 2007-2015 undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair ( TEVAR<ORGANIZATION> ) and open surgical repair ( OSR<ORGANIZATION> ) with available preoperative imaging were analyzed. Sarcopenia<PERSON> was defined as TPAI<ORGANIZATION> < 6.5cm 282/386 DTAA<ORGANIZATION> repairs had imaging available for TPAI<ORGANIZATION> measurements. 71/282 ( 25 % ) underwent TEVAR<ORGANIZATION> and 211/282 ( 75 % ) received OSR<ORGANIZATION>. Preoperative sarcopenia was similar in the 2 groups ( OSR<ORGANIZATION>: 57 % vs. TEVAR: 48 %, p=0.188 ). Risk factors of sarcopenia were age > 70-year-old, female, and large body surface area, while heritable thoracic aortic disease was a protective factor. OSR patients with sarcopenia were older compared to patients without ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), while TEVAR<ORGANIZATION> patients had similar age categorical distribution ( P=0.187 ). Patients with sarcopenia had significantly increased adverse events compared to non-sarcopenia patients in both groups ( sarcopenia-TEVAR: 41 % vs. non-sarcopenia-TEVAR: 16 %, P=0.020<GPE> ; sarcopenia-OSR: 49 % vs. non-sarcopenia-OSR: 32 %, P=0.012 ). Determinants of long-term mortality were increasing age ( parameter estimate: 0.06, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), TPAI<ORGANIZATION> as a decreasing linear function ( parameter estimate [ PE ] :0.36, P=0.003 ), OSR<ORGANIZATION> ( PE: 2.92, P=0.003 ), and interaction between OSR<ORGANIZATION> and TPAI<ORGANIZATION> ( PE: -0.34, P=0.010 ). The interaction term showed that OSR<ORGANIZATION> increases long-term mortality risk in more sarcopenic patients. Preoperative sarcopenia significantly correlated with postoperative adverse events and long-term mortality following DTAA<ORGANIZATION> repair. If anatomically feasible, TEVAR<ORGANIZATION> should be considered in sarcopenic patients.
