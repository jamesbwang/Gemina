 Retinal structures may serve as a biomarker for dementia, but longitudinal studies examining this link are lacking. To investigate the association of inner retinal layer thickness with prevalent and incident dementia in a general population of Dutch<GPE> adults. From September 2007 to June 2012, participants from the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study<PERSON> who were 45 years and older and had gradable retinal optical coherence tomography images and at baseline were free from stroke, Parkinson<PERSON> disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinopathy, myopia, hyperopia, and optic disc pathology were included. They were followed up until January 1, 2015, for the onset of dementia. Inner<PERSON> retinal layer thicknesses ( ie, retinal nerve fiber layer [ RNFL ] ) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer ( GC-IPL ) thicknesses measured on optical coherence tomography images. Odds ratios and hazard ratios for incident dementia per SD<ORGANIZATION> decrease in retinal layer thickness adjusted for age, sex, education, and cardiovascular risk factors. Of 5065 individuals eligible for optical coherence tomography scanning, 3289 ( 64.9 % ) ( mean [ SD ] age 68.9 [ 9.9 ] years, 1879 [ 57 % ] women ) were included in the analysis. Of these 3289 individuals, 41 ( 1.2 % ) already had dementia. Thinner GC-IPL<PERSON> was associated with prevalent dementia ( odds ratio per SD<ORGANIZATION> decrease in GC-IPL<GPE>, 1.37 [ 95 % CI, 0.99-1.90 ] ). No association was found of RNFL<ORGANIZATION> with prevalent dementia. During 14 674 person-years of follow-up ( mean [ SD ], 4.5 [ 1.6 ] years ), 86 individuals ( 2.6 % ) developed dementia of whom 68 ( 2.1 % ) had Alzheimer<PERSON> disease. Thinner RNFL<PERSON> at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing dementia ( hazard ratio per SD<ORGANIZATION> decrease in RNFL<GPE>, 1.44 [ 95 % CI, 1.19-1.75 ] ), which was similar for Alzheimer<ORGANIZATION> disease ( hazard ratio, 1.43 [ 95 % CI, 1.15-1.78 ] ). No association was found between GC-IPL thickness and incident dementia ( hazard ratio, 1.13 [ 95 % CI, 0.90-1.43 ] ). Thinner RNFL<PERSON> is associated with an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer<ORGANIZATION> disease, suggesting that retinal neurodegeneration may serve as a preclinical biomarker for dementia.
