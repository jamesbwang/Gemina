 As the population in the United States<GPE> continues to age, an increase in the number of potential donation after circulatory death ( DCD<ORGANIZATION> ) donors with advanced chronological age can be expected. The aim of this study was to analyze a multi-institutional experience in liver transplantation using DCD<ORGANIZATION> donors 50 years or older. All DCD liver transplant ( LT ) performed at Mayo Clinic Florida<ORGANIZATION>, Mayo Clinic Rochester<PERSON>, and Mayo Clinic Arizona<PERSON> from 2002 to 2016 were included. Recipients of DCD<ORGANIZATION> LT were divided into 2 groups: those with donors 50 years or older ( N = 155 ) and those with donors younger than 50 years ( N = 316 ). Graft<PERSON> survival was similar between the DCD<ORGANIZATION> donors 50 years or older group and DCD<ORGANIZATION> donors younger than 50 group ( P<PERSON> = 0.99 ). Graft<PERSON> survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 87.0 %, 75.6 %, and 71.8 % in the DCD<ORGANIZATION> donors 50 years or older group and 85.8 %, 76.0 %, and 70.4 % in the DCD<ORGANIZATION> donors younger than 50 group.The rate of total biliary complications ( 32.3 % vs 23.7 % ; P<PERSON> = 0.049 ) and of anastomotic strictures ( 16.1 % vs 8.2 % ; P<PERSON> = 0.01 ) were higher in the DCD<ORGANIZATION> donors 50 years or older compared with the DCD<ORGANIZATION> donors younger than 50 group. No statistical significant difference in the rate of ischemic cholangiopathy ( 11.6 % vs 7.6 % ; P<PERSON> = 0.15 ) was seen between the 2 groups. Due<PERSON> to homogeneous practice patterns at the involved institutions, additional Cox regression analysis using national data obtained from Scientific Registry<ORGANIZATION> of Transplant Recipients<ORGANIZATION> was used to evaluate predictors of graft failure in DCD<ORGANIZATION> donors 50 years or older. Significant predictors of graft failure included: a calculated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 30 or higher ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), mechanical ventilation at the time of transplant ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), medical condition ( in intensive care unit ) ( P<PERSON> = 0.002 ), and cold ischemia time ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). The present study demonstrates that acceptable graft and patient survival can be achieved with the usage of DCD<ORGANIZATION> LT with donors 50 years or older. Optimizing recipient selection criteria and minimizing cold ischemia time may further improve outcomes.
