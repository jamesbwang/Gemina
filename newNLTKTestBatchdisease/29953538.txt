 Cholestatic<GPE> patients exhibiting high bile acid serum levels were reported to be more susceptible to bacterial and viral infections. Animal studies in bile duct ligated ( BDL<ORGANIZATION> ) mice suggest that cholestasis leads to an aggravation of hepatic bacterial infections. We have investigated the impact of cholestasis on mouse cytomegalovirus ( MCMV<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced immune responses and viral replication. While MCMV<ORGANIZATION> did not aggravate BDL-induced liver damage, BDL<ORGANIZATION> markedly reduced MCMV-triggered chemokine expression and immune cell recruitment to the liver. MCMV-infected BDL<ORGANIZATION> mice showed diminished trafficking of Ly6C+/F4/80+ myeloid cells and NK1.1+ NK cells to the liver compared to MCMV<ORGANIZATION> infected control mice. Moreover, virus-driven expression of CCL7<ORGANIZATION>, CCL12<ORGANIZATION>, CXCL9<ORGANIZATION> and CXCL10<ORGANIZATION> was clearly impaired in BDL- compared to sham-operated mice. Furthermore, production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was massively augmented in infected BDL<ORGANIZATION> mice. In contrast, intra- and extrahepatic virus replication was unaltered in BDL-MCMV mice when compared to sham-MCMV mice. Cholestasis in the BDL<ORGANIZATION> model severely impaired pathogen-induced chemokine expression in the liver affecting CCR2- and CXCR3-dependent cell trafficking. Cholestasis<PERSON> resulted in reduced recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and NK<ORGANIZATION> cells to the liver.
