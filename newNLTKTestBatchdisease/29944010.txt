 Background<PERSON> Inverse<ORGANIZATION> associations of the Mediterranean<GPE> diet ( MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> ) and physical activity with cardiovascular disease have been previously reported. We investigated the individual and combined contributions of both to this inverse association in a Mediterranean<GPE> cohort. Design We used data from 19,536 participants from a prospective cohort of Spanish<GPE> university graduates, the 'Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra<PERSON> ' ( SUN<ORGANIZATION> ) cohort, followed up between December 1999 and December 2016. Methods Adherence<PERSON> to the MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> was obtained from a 136-item validated food-frequency questionnaire and categorized in tertiles using four previously reported dietary scores. A validated questionnaire assessed the physical activity levels according to volume, intensity and frequency. Results Participants were followed up during a median time of 10.4 years. Compared with the lowest category of adherence to the MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> ( â‰¤3 in the Mediterranean Diet Score<ORGANIZATION> ), higher adherence ( 6-9 points ) was strongly inversely associated with cardiovascular disease ( multivariable adjusted hazard ratio = 0.33 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.20-0.55 ). Also, engaging in an active lifestyle ( 6-8 points in an eight-item score ) compared with low activity ( < 2 points ) was associated with a reduced risk of incident cardiovascular disease ( hazard ratio = 0.43 ; 95 % CI 0.20-0.90 ). Greater adherence to the MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> and engaging in high levels of active lifestyle showed a 75 % relatively reduced risk of cardiovascular disease ( hazard ratio = 0.25 ; 95 % CI 0.13-0.48 ). Conclusions The combined effect of adherence to the MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> and adopting an active lifestyle showed a synergistic inverse association with cardiovascular disease risk.
