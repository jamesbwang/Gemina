 Ragweed<GPE> allergy is a major public health concern. Within Europe<GPE>, ragweed is an introduced species and research has indicated that the amounts of ragweed pollen are likely to increase over Europe<GPE> due to climate change, with corresponding increases in ragweed allergy. To address this threat, improving our understanding of predisposing factors for allergic sensitisation to ragweed and disease is necessary, specifically focusing upon factors that are potentially modifiable ( i.e., environmental ). In this study, a total of 4013 children aged 2‚Åª13 years were recruited across Croatia<GPE> to undergo skin prick tests to determine sensitisation to ragweed and other aeroallergens. A parental questionnaire collected home environment, lifestyle, family and personal medical history, and socioeconomic information. Environmental variables were obtained using Geographical Information Systems<ORGANIZATION> and data from nearby pollen, weather, and air pollution stations. Logistic regression was performed ( clustered on school ) focusing on risk factors for allergic sensitisation and disease. Ragweed<PERSON> sensitisation was strongly associated with ragweed pollen at levels over 5000 grains m
