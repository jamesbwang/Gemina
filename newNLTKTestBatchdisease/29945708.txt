 Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR<ORGANIZATION> ) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR<ORGANIZATION> ), indexes of systemic inflammation, have been associated with worse survival for many types of cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of NLR<ORGANIZATION> and PLR<ORGANIZATION> on overall survival ( OS ) and to explore the value of changes in the NLR<ORGANIZATION> and PLR<ORGANIZATION> with treatment as a response indicator in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ). A total of 68 NSCLC patients in Peking<GPE> University Third Hospital<ORGANIZATION> were eligible for retrospective analysis between April 2008 and April 2015. The pretreatment and posttreatment NLR<ORGANIZATION> and PLR<ORGANIZATION> in all patients were calculated based on complete blood counts. Potential prognostic factors such as age, gender, performance status, histology, stage, response to chemotherapy, NLR<ORGANIZATION> and PLR<ORGANIZATION> were analyzed. NLR<ORGANIZATION> and PLR<ORGANIZATION> were assessed at baseline and during chemotherapy treatment. OS was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> and multivariate Cox<PERSON> regression analyses were performed to determine the associations of the PLR<ORGANIZATION>, NLR<ORGANIZATION> and clinical features with OS<ORGANIZATION>. Among the 68 cases, the values of the posttreatment NLR after two cycles of chemotherapy ( NLR2<ORGANIZATION> ) and the pretreatment NLR<ORGANIZATION> ( NLR0<ORGANIZATION> ) were ( 2.69±2.06 ) and ( 3.94±2.12 ), respectively. NLR2<ORGANIZATION> was significantly lower than NLR0<ORGANIZATION> ( P=0.000 ). There was no difference between the pretreatment PLR<ORGANIZATION> ( PLR0<ORGANIZATION> ) and the posttreatment PLR after two cycles of chemotherapy ( PLR2<ORGANIZATION> ) ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). NLR2 significantly correlated with the response of first line treatment with two or four cycles of chemotherapy. The proportion of high NLR2<ORGANIZATION> in the patients with progression disease was 100.0 %, significantly higher than the proportion of high NLR2<ORGANIZATION> in the patients with partial response or stable disease. NLR0<ORGANIZATION>, PLR0<ORGANIZATION> and NLR2<ORGANIZATION> were significantly correlated with the OS<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), but not with age, performance status, histology, stage, status and regimens of treatment ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). According to univariate analysis, the OS<ORGANIZATION> was significantly associated with NLR0<ORGANIZATION>, PLR0<ORGANIZATION>, NLR2<ORGANIZATION>, the response of 2 and 4 cycles of first line chemotherapy, status and regimens of second line treatment ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), but not with stage, status of third line or beyond treatment and radiotherapy ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). The multivariate analysis showed that NLR0<ORGANIZATION> ( P=0.004 ), the response with 4 cycles of first line chemotherapy ( P=0.022 ) and status of second line treatment ( P=0.007 ) were independent prognostic indicators in the 68 patients. The study showed that NLR0<ORGANIZATION> was well connected with outcomes and NLR2<ORGANIZATION> was well connected with the response to first line chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Therefore, NLR<ORGANIZATION> may be a biomarker for predicting the outcomes and response of first line chemotherapy and a potential target for management of non-small cell lung cancer.
