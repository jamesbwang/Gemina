 Human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) is a viral infectious agent that gradually extinguishes the immune system, resulting in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS<ORGANIZATION> ). The aim of this study was to develop a TaqMan<ORGANIZATION> based detection assay to evaluate HIV-1 plasma viral load and to construct a stable internal positive control ( IPC<ORGANIZATION> ) and external positive control ( EPC<ORGANIZATION> ) RNA<ORGANIZATION> based on Armored RNA<PERSON> ( AR ) technology. The MS2<ORGANIZATION> maturase, coat protein gene and HIV-1 pol gene were cloned in pET-32a plasmid. The recently fabricated recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia<GSP> coli strain BL2<ORGANIZATION> ( DE3<ORGANIZATION> ) and protein expression and Armored RNA<PERSON> was fabricated in presence of isopropyl-L-thio-D-galactopyranoside ( IPTG<ORGANIZATION> ). The Armored<ORGANIZATION> RNA was precipitated and purified by polyethylene glycol ( PEG<ORGANIZATION> ) and sephacryl S-200 chromatography. The stability of Armored<ORGANIZATION> RNA was evaluated by treatment with DNase I and RNase A and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM<ORGANIZATION> ) and gel agarose electrophoresis. The specificity, sensitivity, inter- and intra-day precision, and the dynamic range of the assay were experimentally determined. The AR<ORGANIZATION> was stable in presence of ribonuclease, and the assay had a dynamic detection range from 101 to 105 copies of AR<ORGANIZATION>. The coefficient of variation ( CV ) was 4.8 % for intra-assay and 5.8 % for inter-assay precision. Clinical<PERSON> specificity and sensitivity of the assay were assessed at 100 % and 96.66 %, respectively. The linear regression analysis confirmed a high correlation between the in-house and the commercial assay, Real Star<ORGANIZATION> HIV-1-qRTPCR, respectively ( R2 = 0.888 ). The AR<ORGANIZATION> standard is non-infectious and highly resistant in the presence of ribonuclease. The TaqMan<ORGANIZATION> assay developed is able to quantify HIV<ORGANIZATION> viral load based on a novel conserved region of HIV-1 pol gene which has minimal sequence inconsistency.
