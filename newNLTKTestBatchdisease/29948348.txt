 Vascular antiphospholipid syndrome ( VAPS<ORGANIZATION> ) and obstetric ( OAPS<ORGANIZATION> ) are different entities because some patients only develop thrombosis ( without recurrent pregnancy losses ) and vice versa. Only two articles have reported that low 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3, VD3<ORGANIZATION> ) levels were not correlated with the presence of conventional antiphospholipid antibodies ( aPL Abs<ORGANIZATION>: anticardiolipin ( aCL<ORGANIZATION> ), anti-beta2glycoprotein I ( aβ2gpI<ORGANIZATION> ), and lupus anticoagulant ( LA<ORGANIZATION> ) ), but no article analyzed the association of VD3<ORGANIZATION> and anti-annexin A5 ( aanxA5<ORGANIZATION> ) Abs. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between VD3<ORGANIZATION>, multiple positivity of conventional aPL<ORGANIZATION> and aanxA5 Abs<ORGANIZATION> levels only in female OAPS<ORGANIZATION> vs. VAPS<ORGANIZATION>. Our study included 62 consecutive female PAPS<ORGANIZATION> patients. Concentrations of Abs were measured by ELISA<ORGANIZATION>, while VD3<ORGANIZATION> levels were determined by immunochemiluminescence. Only 10/62 ( 16.13 % ) had sufficient ( ≥ 30 ng/ml ) VD3<ORGANIZATION> levels, while 48/62 ( 77.42 % ) and 4/62 ( 6.45 % ) had insufficiency and VD3<ORGANIZATION> deficiency, respectively. Statistically significant VD3<ORGANIZATION> deficiency was noticed in VAPS<GPE> ( vs. OAPS<ORGANIZATION>, P<PERSON> = 0.013 ). A negative correlation between VD3<ORGANIZATION> levels and the age of patients was noticed ( r = - 0.493, P<PERSON> = 0.032 ) only in VAPS<GPE> subgroup. Multiple positivity of aPL<ORGANIZATION> and aanxA5 Abs<ORGANIZATION> was not associated with VD3<ORGANIZATION> deficiency. Newly emerging aPL Abs<ORGANIZATION>, such as aanxA5 Abs<ORGANIZATION>, or their combinations with classical aPL Abs<ORGANIZATION> are not associated with VD3<ORGANIZATION> deficiency in neither OAPS<ORGANIZATION> nor VAPS<ORGANIZATION> patients. Due<PERSON> to its immunomodulatory roles in B-Ly homeostasis, supplementation with VD3<ORGANIZATION> should be considered in APS<ORGANIZATION>, at least in subgroup with severe form of the disease, i.e., VAPS<ORGANIZATION>.
