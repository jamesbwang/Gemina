 Various<GPE> bacterial species cycle between growth phases and biofilm formation, of which the latter facilitates persistence in inhospitable environments. These phases can be generally characterized by one or more cellular phenotype ( s ), each with distinct virulence factor functionality. In addition, a variety of phenotypes can often be observed within the phases themselves, which can be dependent on host conditions or the presence of nutrient and oxygen gradients within the biofilm itself ( i.e., microenvironments ). Currently, most anti-biofilm strategies have targeted a single phenotype ; this approach has driven effective, yet incomplete, protection due to the lack of consideration of gene expression dynamics throughout the bacteria & rsquo ; s pathogenesis. As such, this article provides an overview of the distinct phenotypes found within each biofilm development phase and demonstrates the unique anti-biofilm solutions each phase offers. However, we conclude that a combinatorial approach must be taken to provide complete protection against biofilm forming bacterial and their resulting diseases.
