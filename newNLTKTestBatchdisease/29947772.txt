 Prox1<GPE> is a transcription factor necessary for lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic function. The aim of the study was to assess the correlation between the expression of Prox1<GPE> and postoperative recurrence in Crohn<GPE> 's Disease<GPE> ( CD ). Forty CD patients who underwent ileocolonic resection were included. Expression levels of Prox1<GPE> and D2-40 were detected using immunohistochemistry. Expression levels of Prox1<GPE>, VEGFR3<ORGANIZATION>, and VEGFC<ORGANIZATION> protein were also detected in fresh CD specimens using western blotting and Q-PCR. Endoscopic recurrence was used as the endpoint. Patients<PERSON> comprised two groups: endoscopic recurrence ( Group<PERSON> R+ ) and no endoscopic recurrence ( Group<PERSON> R- ). Prox1 protein expression was significantly higher in CD than in normal tissues ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), as detected using both immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Analysis of interrelationships revealed significant correlation between Prox1 expression and lymphatic vessel density ( P<PERSON> < 0.001, r = 0.823 ). There was also significant correlation between Prox1 expression and the visceral fat area ( VFA<ORGANIZATION> ) ( P=0.002, r=-0.469 ). The Group<ORGANIZATION> R- patients had significantly higher Prox1 expression than the Group<ORGANIZATION> R+ patients ( 21.08 ±1.61 vs. 15.64 ±1.17, P=0.011 ). Also, the lymphatic vessel density value was lower in Group<GPE> R+ than in Group<GPE> R- patients ( 6.02 ±0.39 vs. 8.13 ±0.59, P=0.004 ). Moreover, there was a significant difference in the VFA<ORGANIZATION> between Group R-<PERSON> and Group<PERSON> R+ patients ( 64.43 ±7.76 vs. 90.44 ±6.11, P=0.016 ). In addition to Prox1<GPE>, VEGFC/VEGFR3 was found to increase, which was further confirmed using Q-PCR. Prox1 expression could be useful as a protective factor against recurrence in CD patients. The therapeutic role of Prox1<GPE> may lead to improved treatments.
