 Photothermal<GPE> therapy ( PTT<ORGANIZATION> ) uses light absorbing materials to generate heat for treatment of diseases, like cancer. The advantages of using PTT<ORGANIZATION> components that absorb in the near-infrared ( NIR<ORGANIZATION> ) include reduced tissue auto-fluorescence and higher penetration depths. However, NIR<ORGANIZATION> laser light can still be scattered and absorbed by biological tissues, thus decreasing the amount of the energy reaching the PTT<ORGANIZATION> agents. We have developed two distinct formulations of NIR-absorbing nanoparticles, one which can be utilized for PTT<ORGANIZATION> only, and another for both PTT<ORGANIZATION> and fluorescence imaging of colorectal cancer. In this work, the fluorescence detection limit and the PTT<ORGANIZATION> heating potential of the two nanoparticle types were determined using alginate tissue phantoms. The objective of this study was to determine the PTT<ORGANIZATION> efficiency and theranostic potential of the nanoparticles by irradiating 3D collagen tumor spheroids, containing nanoparticles and CT26<ORGANIZATION> mouse colorectal cancer cells, through increasing tissue phantom thicknesses and then quantifying cell death. Materials and Methods<ORGANIZATION> Our lab has previously developed nanoparticles based on the semiconducting, conjugated polymer poly [ 4,4-bis ( 2-ethylhexyl ) -cyclopenta [ 2,1-b ; 3,4-b ' ] dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole-4,7-diyl ] ( PCPDTBSe<ORGANIZATION> ). We have also made a hybrid nanoparticle that heats and fluoresces by combining PCPDTBSe<ORGANIZATION> polymer with the fluorescent poly [ ( 9,9-dihexylfluorene ) -co-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-co-4,7-di ( thiophen-2-yl ) -2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ] ( PFBTDBT10<ORGANIZATION> ) polymer to yield nanoparticles termed Hybrid<PERSON> Donor-Acceptor Polymer Particles ( H-DAPPs ). H-DAPPs and PCPDTBSe<ORGANIZATION> nanoparticles were added to three-dimensional collagen gel tumor spheroids in order to represent nanoparticles in a tumor. Alginate tissue phantoms, comprised of an optical scattering agent ( Intralipid<ORGANIZATION> ) and an optical absorbing material ( hemoglobin ) in order to mirror biological tissue scattering effects, were used to simulate increasing tissue thickness between the nanoparticles and the PTT<ORGANIZATION> energy source. Fluorescence from the H-DAPPs was detectable through 6 mm of tissue phantoms. It was found that less than 10 % of the laser energy could penetrate through 9 mm of tissue phantoms and only 60 % of the laser energy passed through the 1.5 mm phantoms, regardless of laser power. PTT<ORGANIZATION> experiments, using 800 nm light at 2.2 W/cm The results of this work validated the heating potential and fluorescence detection limitations of two theranostic polymer nanoparticles by utilizing alginate tissue phantoms and 3D tumor spheroids. H-DAPPs and PCPDTBSe<ORGANIZATION> polymer nanoparticles can be utilized as effective PTT<ORGANIZATION> agents by exploiting their absorption of NIR<ORGANIZATION> light and H-DAPPs have advantageous fluorescence for imaging colorectal cancer. The data generated from this study design can allow for other NIR<ORGANIZATION> absorbing and fluorescing nanoparticle formulations to be evaluated prior to in vivo experimentation. Lasers Surg.
