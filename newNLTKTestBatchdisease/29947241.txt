 Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF-BB ) is an important factor in the regeneration and wound healing. One of the problems is that there is not enough efficiency in the transmission or delivery of such factors in the wound site. In this study, alginate sulfate hydrogel was synthesized with recombinant PDGF-BB growth factor for achieving a quick method in wound healing. In this study, Alginate<ORGANIZATION> sulfate hydrogel was made by photo-crosslinking method and methacrylate. Its toxicity was evaluated by MTT<ORGANIZATION> assay. Transforming growth factor was studied in releasing from synthesized alginate sulfate hydrogels and also, lack of toxicity was confirmed, and hydrogel was made with a recombinant human growth factor. Wounds were created with a diameter of 10 mm on the back of rats in order to check the wound healing. This study showed that alginate sulfate hydrogels-PDGF-BB were faster in wound healing than non-sulfate alginate hydrogels-PDGF-BB. Therefore, the controlled delivery of growth factor system can be a powerful idea for therapeutic applications for wound healing. Alginate sulfate hydrogel with recombinant growth factor 4 Âµg/cm2 ( PDGF-BB ) was very suitable for wound healing ( Tab<ORGANIZATION>. 1, Fig<PERSON>. 3, Ref<PERSON>. 34 ).
