 Indirubin<GPE>, a constituent of the Chinese<GPE> herbal medicine `` Qing-Dai, '' has anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of indirubin for ameliorating colonic inflammation in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced acute and chronic colitis were treated with indirubin in their diet. Clinical<PERSON> and histologic changes were evaluated. In addition, colon levels of interleukin-6, a critical pro-inflammatory mediator, was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the model of acute colitis, indirubin treatment improved the loss of body weight. Histology of colonic tissue revealed that indirubin treatment improved the histology grading of colitis ( Our study clearly showed that oral intake of indirubin can improve murine DSS-induced colitis ( which mimics human inflammatory bowel disease ).
