 HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Irisin<PERSON> is a miokyne secreted by skeletal muscle, which may influence insulin homeostasis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ) and atherosclerosis. Our objective was to evaluate the relationships between serum irisin, insulin homeostasis, NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> and subclinical atherosclerosis in HIV-infected males. Cross-sectional study in a cohort of HIV-infected patients. Inclusion criteria: men older than 18 years ; antiretroviral therapy ( ART<ORGANIZATION> ) -naïve or on effective ART ( < 50 HIV-1 RNA<ORGANIZATION> copies/mL ) without changes in the previous 6 months ; no diabetes or hepatitis C. Irisin<PERSON> was measured by enzymatic immuno-assay ( Phoenix Pharmaceuticals<ORGANIZATION> ), insulin sensitivity by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ), as well as the 2-h continuous infusion of glucose with model assessment ( CIGMA-HOMA ). Hepatic<PERSON> steatosis was measured by 1-H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, subclinical atherosclerosis by evaluation of carotid intima-media thickness ( C-IMT ), measured by Ultrasonography<PERSON>. 89 men ( age 42.0 ± 8.3 years, duration of HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection 7.9 ± 5.6 years, CD4<ORGANIZATION> count 547 ± 279 cells/mL ) were included. Circulating irisin was positively related to HOMA-IR and CIGMA-HOMA, hepatic triglyceride content, and to VAT/SAT ratio. Higher irisin concentrations were associated with higher C-IMT, although this association did not persist in multivariate analysis. Lipodystrophy<PERSON> and a higher baseline PAI-1 concentration were independent associated with C-IMT. In male HIV patients without diabetes, higher irisin concentrations are positively associated to insulin resistance, NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> and subclinical atherosclerosis. However, waist-hip-ratio is the main determinant of insulin resistance, and PAI-1 and lipodystrophy were the strongest determinants of IMT<ORGANIZATION> in this population.
