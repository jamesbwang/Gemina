 The pathogenesis leading to poor functional outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage ( aSAH<ORGANIZATION> ) is multifactorial and not fully understood. We evaluated a machine learning approach based on easily determinable clinical and CT<ORGANIZATION> perfusion ( CTP<ORGANIZATION> ) features in the course of patient admission to predict the functional outcome 6 months after ictus. Out of 630 consecutive subarachnoid haemorrhage patients ( 2008-2015 ), 147 ( mean age 54.3, 66.7 % women ) were retrospectively included ( Inclusion: aSAH, admission within 24 h of ictus, CTP<ORGANIZATION> within 24 h of admission, documented modified Rankin<PERSON> scale ( mRS<ORGANIZATION> ) grades after 6 months. Exclusion: occlusive therapy before first CTP<ORGANIZATION>, previous aSAH<ORGANIZATION>, CTP<ORGANIZATION> not evaluable ). A random forests model with conditional inference trees was optimised and trained on sex, age, World Federation<PERSON> of Neurosurgical Societies<ORGANIZATION> ( WFNS<ORGANIZATION> ) and modified Fisher<GPE> grades, aneurysm in anterior vs. posterior circulation, early external ventricular drainage ( EVD<ORGANIZATION> ), as well as MTT<ORGANIZATION> and T In the final model, using 200 trees and the synthetic minority oversampling technique, median balanced accuracy was 84.4 % ( SD 0.7 ) over the training folds and 70.9 % ( SD 1.2 ) over the validation folds. The five most important features were the modified Fisher<PERSON> grade, age, MTT<ORGANIZATION> range, WFNS<ORGANIZATION> and early EVD. A random forests model trained on easily determinable features in the course of patient admission can predict the functional outcome 6 months after aSAH<ORGANIZATION> with considerable accuracy. • Features determinable in the course of admission of a patient with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage ( aSAH ) can predict the functional outcome 6 months after the occurrence of aSAH<ORGANIZATION>. • The top five predictive features were the modified Fisher<PERSON> grade, age, the mean transit time ( MTT<ORGANIZATION> ) range from computed tomography perfusion ( CTP<ORGANIZATION> ), the WFNS<ORGANIZATION> grade and the early necessity for an external ventricular drainage ( EVD<ORGANIZATION> ). • The range between the minimum and the maximum MTT<ORGANIZATION> may prove to be a valuable biomarker for detrimental functional outcome.
