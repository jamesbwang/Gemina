 Chronic<GPE> myleoid leukemia ( CML<ORGANIZATION> ) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized with the constitutive activation of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase which is a target for imatinib, the first line treatment option for CML<ORGANIZATION>. Constitutive activation of NFκB<ORGANIZATION> and β-catenin signaling promotes cellular proliferation and survival and resistance to Imatinib<GPE> therapy in CML<ORGANIZATION>. Akirin-2 is a nuclear protein which is required for NFκB<ORGANIZATION> dependent gene expression as a cofactor and has been linked to Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The purpose of this study is to examine Akirin-2, NFκB<ORGANIZATION> and β-catenin in imatinib resistance of CML<ORGANIZATION> and to test if any direct physical protein-protein interaction exists between NFkB<ORGANIZATION> and both β-catenin and Akirin-2. RT-PCR and western blot were performed to determine Akirin-2, NFκB-p65 and β-catenin gene and protein expressions, Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis were carried out to detect the direct physical interactions and binding of NFκB-p65 and β-catenin proteins to MDR1<ORGANIZATION> promoter region, respectively. β-catenin and NFκB-p65 proteins bound to DNA<ORGANIZATION> promoter regions of MDR1<ORGANIZATION> in imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML<ORGANIZATION> cells, whereas any direct protein-protein interaction could not be found between NFκB-p65 and Akirin-2 or β-catenin proteins. Nuclear β-catenin and NFκB-p65 levels increased in imatinib resistance. Moreover, increased Akirin-2 protein accumulation in the nucleus was shown for the first time in imatinib resistant CML<ORGANIZATION> cells. We show for the first time that Akirin-2 can be a novel biomarker in imatinib resistance. Targeting Akirin-2, NFκB<ORGANIZATION> and β-catenin genes may provide an opportunity to overcome imatinib resistance in CML<ORGANIZATION>.
