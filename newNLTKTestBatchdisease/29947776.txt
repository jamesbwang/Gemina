 Coenurosis<GPE>, caused by the larval coenurus of the tapeworm Taenia<GPE> multiceps, is a fatal central nervous system disease in both sheep and humans. Though treatment and prevention options are available, the control of coenurosis still faces presents great challenges. Here, we present a high-quality genome sequence of T. multiceps in which 240 Mb ( 96 % ) of the genome has been successfully assembled using Pacbio<PERSON> single-molecule real-time ( SMRT<ORGANIZATION> ) and Hi-C data with a N50 length of 44.8 Mb. In total, 49.5 Mb ( 20.6 % ) repeat sequences and 13, 013 gene models were identified. We found that Taenia<GPE> spp. have an expansion of transposable elements and recent small-scale gene duplications following the divergence of Taenia<GPE> from Echinococcus<GPE>, but not in Echinococcus<GPE> genomes, and the genes underlying environmental adaptability and dosage effect tend to be over-retained in the T. multiceps genome. Moreover, we identified several genes encoding proteins involved in proglottid formation and interactions with the host central nervous system, which may contribute to the adaption of T. multiceps to its parasitic life style. Our study not only provides insights into the biology and evolution of T. multiceps, but also identifies a set of species-specific gene targets for developing novel treatment and control tools for coenurosis.
