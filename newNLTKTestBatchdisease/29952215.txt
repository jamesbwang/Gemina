 The aim of this study was to assess the washout rate ( WOR<ORGANIZATION> ) for thallium-201-chloride single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT<ORGANIZATION> ) myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI<ORGANIZATION> ) using cadmium zinc telluride detectors for SPECT<ORGANIZATION> ( CZT<ORGANIZATION> SPECT ) versus conventional Anger-type SPECT ( conventional SPECT ). A total of 52 Japanese<GPE> patients were examined using CZT<ORGANIZATION> SPECT and conventional SPECT, and the global WORs were compared. Additionally, the MPI<ORGANIZATION> WORs were compared for patients with a normal MPI<ORGANIZATION> versus those in whom MPI<ORGANIZATION> reflected the patients ' multivessel disease ( MVD<ORGANIZATION> ) MPI<ORGANIZATION>. Washout rates were similar when approximated by CZT<ORGANIZATION> SPECT versus conventional SPECT 12.59 ± 2.26 % /h vs 12.57 ± 2.27 % /h ( P<PERSON> = .997 ), respectively. The WOR<ORGANIZATION> values for CZT<ORGANIZATION> SPECT versus conventional SPECT were 13.42 % /h ( 1.53 % /h ) vs 13.93 % /h ( 1.24 % /h ) ( P<PERSON> = .337 ), respectively, for 7 normal MPI<ORGANIZATION> patients, and 10.64 ± 2.20 % /h vs 10.84 ± 2.26 % /h ( P<PERSON> = .848 ), respectively, for 7 MVD-MPI patients. The WOR<ORGANIZATION> values for normal MPI<ORGANIZATION> versus MVD-MPI patients for CZT<ORGANIZATION> SPECT were 13.42 ± 1.53 % /h vs 10.64 ± 2.20 % /h ( P<PERSON> = .025 ), respectively. Thallium-201-chloride WOR<ORGANIZATION> values obtained with high-efficiency CZT<ORGANIZATION> SPECT, which enabled significantly reduced imaging times and use of a low-dose protocol, were similar to those obtained with conventional SPECT.
