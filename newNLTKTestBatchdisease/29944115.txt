 Human<GPE> immunoglobulin products are used for the treatment of a number of diseases, such as primary or secondary immunodeficiencies and autoimmune conditions due to the complete absence of antibodies or the production of defective immunoglobulins. Quality control of human immunoglobulin products is essential to ensure therapeutic functionality and safety. This includes testing for Fc function and anticomplementary activity ( ACA<ORGANIZATION> ), as well as verification of appropriate molecular size distribution using size-exclusion chromatography as prescribed in the European Pharmacopoeia<ORGANIZATION> ( Ph. Eur<PERSON>. ) monographs 0338, 0918, 2788 and 1928. To this end, specific biological reference preparations ( BRPs<ORGANIZATION> ) must be used. Stocks of these BRPs were running low and therefore a collaborative study was run by the European Directorate<ORGANIZATION> for the Quality<ORGANIZATION> of Medicines<ORGANIZATION> & HealthCare<ORGANIZATION> ( EDQM<ORGANIZATION> ), under the aegis of the Biological Standardisation Programme<ORGANIZATION>, to calibrate replacement batches. Seventeen laboratories, including manufacturers and Official Medicines Control Laboratories<ORGANIZATION>, took part in the study. Several batches of candidate BRPs<ORGANIZATION> were calibrated against human immunoglobulin ( ACA<ORGANIZATION> and molecular size ) BRP<ORGANIZATION> batch 1 and human immunoglobulin ( Fc function and molecular size ) BRP batch 1 to ensure continuity. Based on the study results, the candidate BRPs<ORGANIZATION> were adopted by the Ph. Eur<PERSON>. Commission as Ph<GPE>. Eur<PERSON>. human immunoglobulin for anticomplementary activity BRP<ORGANIZATION> batch 1 and batch 2, Ph<GPE>. Eur<PERSON>. human immunoglobulin for Fc function BRP<ORGANIZATION> batch 1 and batch 2 and Ph. Eur<PERSON>. human immunoglobulin ( molecular size ) BRP<ORGANIZATION> batch 2 and batch 3.
