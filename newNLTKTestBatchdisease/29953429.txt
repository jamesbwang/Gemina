 Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI<ORGANIZATION> ) is critical to the control and elimination of tuberculosis disease ( TB ) in the United States<GPE>. In 2011, CDC<ORGANIZATION> recommended a short-course combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks ( 3HP ) by directly observed therapy ( DOT<ORGANIZATION> ) for treatment of LTBI<ORGANIZATION>, with limitations for use in children aged < 12 years and persons with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection ( 1 ). CDC<ORGANIZATION> identified the use of 3HP in those populations, as well as self-administration of the 3HP regimen, as areas to address in updated recommendations. In 2017, a CDC Work Group<ORGANIZATION> conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of the 3HP regimen using methods adapted from the Guide to Community<ORGANIZATION> Preventive Services. In total, 19 articles representing 15 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis, which determined that 3HP is as safe and effective as other recommended LTBI<ORGANIZATION> regimens and achieves substantially higher treatment completion rates. In July 2017, the Work Group<ORGANIZATION> presented the meta-analysis findings to a group of TB<ORGANIZATION> experts, and in December 2017, CDC<ORGANIZATION> solicited input from the Advisory Council<ORGANIZATION> for the Elimination<ORGANIZATION> of Tuberculosis<GPE> ( ACET<ORGANIZATION> ) and members of the public for incorporation into the final recommendations. CDC<ORGANIZATION> continues to recommend 3HP for treatment of LTBI<ORGANIZATION> in adults and now recommends use of 3HP 1 ) in persons with LTBI<ORGANIZATION> aged 2-17 years ; 2 ) in persons with LTBI<ORGANIZATION> who have HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS<ORGANIZATION> ), and are taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine ; and 3 ) by DOT<ORGANIZATION> or self-administered therapy ( SAT<ORGANIZATION> ) in persons aged â‰¥2 years.
