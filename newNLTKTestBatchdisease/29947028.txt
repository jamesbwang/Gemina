 Wound healing is a complex process that is essential to provide skin homeostasis. Infection with pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus<PERSON> aureus can lead to chronic wounds which are challenging to heal. Previously, we demonstrated that the antimicrobial endotoxin-neutralizing peptide Pep19-2.5 promotes artificial wound closure in keratinocytes. Here, we investigated the mechanism of peptide-induced cell migration and if Pep19-2.5 accelerates wound closure in vivo. Cell<PERSON> migration was examined in HaCaT<GPE> keratinocytes and P2X7<GPE> receptor ( P2X7R ) -overexpressing HEK293<ORGANIZATION> cells using the wound healing scratch assay. Protein<PERSON> expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, ATP<ORGANIZATION> release, calcium influx and mitochondrial ROS<ORGANIZATION> were analysed to characterize Pep19-2.5-mediated signalling. For in vivo studies female BALB/c mice were wounded and infected with methicillin-resistant<ORGANIZATION> S. aureus or left non-infected and topically treated with Pep19-2.5 twice daily for 6 days. Specific P2X7R antagonists inhibited Pep19-2.5-induced cell migration and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in keratinocytes and P2X7R-transfected HEK293<ORGANIZATION> cells. ATP release was not increased by Pep19-2.5, however, ATP<ORGANIZATION> was required for cell migration. Pep19-2.5 increased cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial ROS<ORGANIZATION> which were involved in peptide-induced migration and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In both non-infected and MRSA-infected wounds the wound diameter was reduced already at day 2 post-wounding in the Pep19-2.5-treated groups compared to vehicle and remained decreased until day 6. Our data suggest the potential application of Pep19-2.5 in the treatment of non-infected and S. aureus-infected wounds and provide insights into the mechanism involved in Pep19-2.5-induced wound healing.
