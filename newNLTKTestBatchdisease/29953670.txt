 Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for fracture independent of FRAXÂ® probability. We directly compared four proposed methods to improve the performance of FRAX<ORGANIZATION> for type 2 diabetes: ( 1 ) the rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) input to FRAX<GPE> ; ( 2 ) the trabecular bone score ( TBS<ORGANIZATION> ) -adjustment to FRAX<GPE> ; ( 3 ) reducing the femoral neck T-score input to FRAX<ORGANIZATION> by 0.5 SD ; ( 4 ) increasing the age input to FRAX<ORGANIZATION> by 10 years. We examined major osteoporotic fractures ( MOF<ORGANIZATION> ) and hip fractures ( HF ) over mean 8.3 years observation among 44,543 women and men 40 years of age or older ( 4136 with diabetes ) with baseline lumbar spine and hip DXA<ORGANIZATION> during 1999-2016. Controlled for unadjusted FRAX<ORGANIZATION> probability, diabetes was associated with increased risk for MOF<ORGANIZATION> and HF<ORGANIZATION>. All four FRAX<ORGANIZATION> adjustments attenuated the effect of diabetes, but a residual effect of diabetes was seen on MOF<ORGANIZATION> risk after TBS<ORGANIZATION> adjustment, and on HF risk after the RA<ORGANIZATION> and TBS<ORGANIZATION> adjustments. Among those with diabetes, unadjusted FRAX<ORGANIZATION> risk underestimated MOF<ORGANIZATION> ( observed/predicted ratio 1.15, 95 % CI 1.03-1.28 ) but this was no longer significant after applying the diabetes adjustments. HF risk was more severely underestimated ( observed/predicted ratio 1.85, 95 % CI 1.51-2.20 ) and was only partially corrected with the diabetes adjustments ( still significant for the RA<ORGANIZATION> and TBS<ORGANIZATION> adjustments ). Among those with diabetes there was moderate reclassification based upon a fixed MOF<ORGANIZATION> cutoff of 20 % ( 4.1-7.1 % ) or fixed HF cutoff of 3 % ( 5.7-16.5 % ). Net reclassification improvement ( NRI<ORGANIZATION> ) increased for MOF<ORGANIZATION> with each of the diabetes adjustments ( range 3.9-5.6 % in the diabetes subgroup ). In conclusion, each of the proposed methods for addressing limitations in the ability of FRAX<ORGANIZATION> to assess fracture risk in individuals with diabetes was found to improve performance, though no single method was optimal in all settings.
