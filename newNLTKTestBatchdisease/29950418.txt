 Cytosine<PERSON> DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation is a conserved epigenetic silencing mechanism that defends against biotic stresses such as geminivirus infection. As a countermeasure, geminiviruses encode proteins that inhibit methylation and transcriptional gene silencing ( TGS<ORGANIZATION> ). Previous studies showed that V2<GPE> protein of
