 Women enrolled in HIV prevention efficacy trials, are counselled at every visit on prevention of HIV<ORGANIZATION>, STIs<ORGANIZATION> and pregnancy. Incident pregnancy impacts on efficacy outcomes. Incidence rates of pregnancy and HIV/STIs among women who became pregnant and associated risk factors were assessed. Data from 9165 women participating in HIV prevention trials in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa<GPE>, from 2002-2012 were combined. Demographic and behavioural predictors of incidence pregnancy and incidence HIV and STIs<ORGANIZATION> were determined using Cox<PERSON> regression models. Overall pregnancy incidence was 9.6 per 100-person year ( py ) ( 95 % Cl: 9.1, 10.3 ). HIV incidence among pregnant women was 5.93 per 100-py ( 95 % Cl: 4.73, 7.44 ). Incidence of STIs<ORGANIZATION> among pregnant women for Chlamydia<GPE> trachomatis, Trichomonas<GPE> vaginalis, Neisseria<GPE> gonorrhoeae, and Treponema<ORGANIZATION> pallidum ( syphilis ) were 10.87, 7.42, 3.92 and 1.43 per 100-py, respectively. In the adjusted analyses, we observed overlapping risk factors for HIV<ORGANIZATION> acquisition during pregnancy i.e. young age, not married/not cohabitating and low parity. Young women ( < 20 years of age ) were over 3 times at higher risk of pregnancy and HIV<ORGANIZATION> acquisition. We identified overlapping risk factors for pregnancy and HIV<ORGANIZATION> incidence, suggesting an urgent need for appropriate, targeted, individual-centred counselling for women participating in HIV prevention trials.
