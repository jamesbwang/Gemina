 Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi<ORGANIZATION> ) is a human-adapted bacterial pathogen, responsible for infections of the human respiratory tract. This pathogen expresses a range of adhesins that mediate binding to host cells. Most NTHi<ORGANIZATION> strains can express the related adhesins HMW1<ORGANIZATION> and HMW2<ORGANIZATION>. Expression of HMW<ORGANIZATION> proteins is phase-variable: changes in the length of simple-sequence repeats located in the encoding genes promoter regions results in changes in expression levels of these adhesins. HMW<ORGANIZATION> expression is also controlled by epigenetic regulation. HMW1<ORGANIZATION> has been previously demonstrated to bind Î± 2-3 sialyl-lactosamine, but affinity of this interaction has not been investigated. The host receptor ( s ) for HMW2<ORGANIZATION> is currently unknown. We hypothesized that host glycans may act as receptors for HMW2-mediated adherence. We examined the glycan-binding activity of HMW2<ORGANIZATION> using glycan arrays and Surface Plasmon Resonance<PERSON> ( SPR<ORGANIZATION> ). These studies demonstrate that HMW2<ORGANIZATION> binds 2-6 linked N-acetylneuraminic acid with high affinity. HMW2<ORGANIZATION> did not bind glycan structures containing the non-human form of sialic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Thus, the specificity of HMW1<ORGANIZATION> and HMW2<ORGANIZATION> have complementary lectin activities that may allow NTHi<ORGANIZATION> distinct niches in the human host.
