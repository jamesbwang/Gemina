 Neurological<GPE> prognostication is an essential part of post-resuscitation care in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA<ORGANIZATION> ). This study aims to assess the use of computed tomography ( CT ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MR ) of the head, electroencephalography ( EEG<ORGANIZATION> ), and somatosensory evoked potentials ( SSEP<ORGANIZATION> ) in neurological prognostication in resuscitated OHCA<ORGANIZATION> patients and factors associated with their use in Danish<GPE> tertiary and non-tertiary centers from 2005 to 2013 and associations with outcome. We used the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry<ORGANIZATION> to identify patients ≥18 years of age admitted to intensive care units due to OHCA<ORGANIZATION> of presumed cardiac etiology. CT 0-20 days and MR, SSEP<ORGANIZATION>, and EEG<ORGANIZATION> ≥2-20 days post OHCA were considered related to prognostication. Incidence<PERSON> and factors associated with procedures were assessed by multiple Cox regression with death as competing risk. Use of CT<ORGANIZATION>, MR, EEG<ORGANIZATION>, and SSEP<ORGANIZATION> increased during the study period ( CT: 51 % -67 %, HR Use<ORGANIZATION> of neurological prognostication procedures increased during the study period. EEG<ORGANIZATION> and SSEP<ORGANIZATION> were more used in tertiary centers. CT, EEG<ORGANIZATION> and SSEP<ORGANIZATION> were associated with increased mortality.
