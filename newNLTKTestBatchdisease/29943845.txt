 Pulmonary fibrosis ( PF ), characterized by the destruction of lung tissue architecture and the abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix ( ECM<ORGANIZATION> ) proteins, currently has no satisfactory treatment. The role of microRNA<ORGANIZATION> ( miR<ORGANIZATION> ) -21 in PF<GPE> has been reported ; the current study attempted to investigate a novel molecular mechanism by which miR-21 exerted its function. Consistent with previous studies, miR-21 inhibition reduced ECM<ORGANIZATION> protein levels in bleomycin ( BLM<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced mouse model of PF<ORGANIZATION>. In human pulmonary fibroblast ( IMR-90 ), miR-21 inhibition reduced transforming growth factor β1 ( TGFβ1<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced ECM<ORGANIZATION> protein expression. Regarding a novel molecular mechanism, TGFβ1<ORGANIZATION> combined with TGFβ1<ORGANIZATION> receptor 1 ( TGFβ1RI<ORGANIZATION> ) to activate SMAD2/3, promote SMAD4<ORGANIZATION> nucleus transformation, and thus regulate miR-21 expression and ECM<ORGANIZATION>. SMAD3<ORGANIZATION> and SMADs<ORGANIZATION> complex could bind to the promoter region of miR-21 to promote miR-21 expression. In conclusion, miR-21 exerts promotive effects on BLM-induced PF and TGFβ1-induced ECM in IMR-90<GPE> ; TGFβ1<ORGANIZATION> combines with TGFβ1RI<ORGANIZATION> to activate SMAD2/3, promote SMAD4<ORGANIZATION> nucleus transformation, promote miR-21 expression, and thus to promote BLM-induced PF and TGFβ1-induced ECM in IMR-90 cells.
