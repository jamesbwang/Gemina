 Autophagy<GPE> is a catabolic process which is involved in the development of many diseases including diabetes mellitus and its complications. Hyposalivation is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, whereas its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we observed that the stimulated salivary flow rate of SMG<ORGANIZATION> was significantly decreased in db/db mice, a diabetic mice model. The expressions of aquaporin 5 ( AQP5<ORGANIZATION> ), a water channel protein, were decreased, whereas the mRNA<ORGANIZATION> level of AQP5<ORGANIZATION> was increased in SMGs<ORGANIZATION> of both diabetic patients and mice. Under transmission electron microcope, more autophagosomes were detected in diabetic SMGs<ORGANIZATION>. Expressions of autophagy related proteins LC3II<ORGANIZATION>, Beclin-1 and ATG5<ORGANIZATION> were increased, meanwhile autophagy substrate p62 was decreased in SMGs<ORGANIZATION> of diabetic patients and mice, indicating that autophagy was activated in diabetic SMG<ORGANIZATION>. Double<PERSON> immunofluorescence staining showed that the colocalization of AQP5<ORGANIZATION> and LC3<ORGANIZATION> was increased in SMGs<ORGANIZATION> of diabetic mice. In cultured SMG-C6 cells, high glucose ( HG ), but not high osmotic pressure, reduced AQP5<ORGANIZATION> protein expression and induced autophagy. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenin, an autophagy inhibitor, or by autophagy-related gene 5 siRNA, decreased HG-induced AQP5 reduction in SMG-C6 cells. Additionally, the expression of p-p85, p-Akt and p-mTOR were decreased in HG-treated SMG-C6 cells. Pretreatment with 740Y-P, a PI3K<ORGANIZATION> agonist, significantly suppressed HG-induced autophagy and AQP5<ORGANIZATION> degradation. Taken together, these results indicate that autophagy plays a crucial role in AQP5<GPE> degradation in diabetic SMG<ORGANIZATION> via PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which contributes to the dysfunction of diabetic SMG<ORGANIZATION>. Our study provides a novel mechanism of diabetic hyposalivation.
