 Although endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms ( AAAs<ORGANIZATION> ) has been demonstrated to have favorable outcomes, not all cohorts of patients with AAA<ORGANIZATION> fare equally well. Our goal was to investigate perioperative and 1-year outcomes in patients with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD<ORGANIZATION> ) on dialysis, who have traditionally fared worse after vascular interventions, to assess how ESRD<ORGANIZATION> affects outcomes in a large modern cohort of endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. The Vascular Quality Initiative<ORGANIZATION> database was queried for all patients undergoing EVAR<ORGANIZATION> from 2010 to 2017. ESRD<ORGANIZATION> patients were compared with patients not on dialysis. Propensity-matched scoring and multivariable analysis were used to isolate the effects of ESRD<ORGANIZATION>. Of 28,683 EVARs<ORGANIZATION> identified, there were 321 ( 1.12 % ) patients with ESRD<ORGANIZATION> on dialysis. Patients with ESRD<ORGANIZATION> had no difference in presenting AAA<ORGANIZATION> size ( 57.5 ± 12.7 mm vs 56.7 ± 17.2 mm ; P<PERSON> = .44 ) ; however, they had more urgent/emergent repairs ( 20.6 % vs 13.6 % ; P<PERSON> = .002 ) than those without ESRD<ORGANIZATION>. ESRD<ORGANIZATION> patients were more often younger, nonwhite, and nonobese and less likely to have commercial insurance ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). ESRD<ORGANIZATION> patients more often had hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, previous lower extremity bypass, aneurysm repair, and carotid interventions ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). There was no difference in the rate of concomitant procedures. Matching based on demographics, comorbidities, and operative details showed that ESRD<ORGANIZATION> patients had longer hospital length of stay ( 4.8 ± 9.4 days vs 4.1 ± 12.6 days ; P<PERSON> = .026 ) and higher 30-day mortality ( 7 % vs 2.4 % ; P<PERSON> < .001 ). There was no difference in cardiac, pulmonary, lower extremity, bowel, and stroke complications or return to the operating room. On multivariable analysis, ESRD<ORGANIZATION> was associated with 30-day mortality ( odds ratio, 4.1 ; 95 % confidence interval, 2.6-6.7 ; P<PERSON> < .001 ). Of the 24,750 elective EVARs<ORGANIZATION>, 1.04 % had ESRD<ORGANIZATION> on dialysis. Matched<PERSON> data for elective EVAR<ORGANIZATION> show increased postoperative length of stay, hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality for ESRD<ORGANIZATION> patients on dialysis compared with those who are not. There was no association with postoperative myocardial infarction or pulmonary complications. At 1 year, patients with ESRD<ORGANIZATION> on dialysis had worse survival ( 78 % vs 94 % ; P<PERSON> < .001 ), and ESRD<ORGANIZATION> was associated with higher mortality ( hazard ratio, 3.3 ; 95 % confidence interval, 2.5-4.2 ; P<PERSON> < .001 ). Among patients undergoing EVAR<ORGANIZATION>, ESRD<ORGANIZATION> is independently associated with higher perioperative and 1-year mortality despite not being associated with higher postoperative complications. This should be taken into account during informed consent for EVAR<ORGANIZATION> and risk-benefit considerations in this high-risk population, particularly for elective repair.
