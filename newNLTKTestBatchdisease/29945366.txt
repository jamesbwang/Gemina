 As a basic syndrome of Chinese<GPE> medicine, the study of characteristic syndrome spectrum of Qi<GPE> deficiency syndrome is of great significance for the standardization of clinical diagnosis and modern material basis research. Suitable operators and algorithms were chosen to dig out the relationship between diseases, syndromes, symptoms, detection indicators and etiologist from the literature of Chinese<GPE> clinical and basic research by literature mining method of frequency statistics, association rules and complex network analysis. Moreover, the information system of Institute<ORGANIZATION> of Information<GPE> on Traditional Chinese Medicine<ORGANIZATION>, China<GPE> Academy of Chinese<GPE> Medical Sciences was taken as the tools of data mining. The objective was to study the characteristic spectrum of Qi<GPE> deficiency syndrome and to explore the characteristics of Qi<GPE> deficiency syndrome. The results showed that the syndrome of fatigue, dietary were the main factors. The main pathogenesis of coronary heart disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and stroke the disease were Qi deficiency. The clinical features of Qi<GPE> deficiency syndrome were fatigue, shortness of breath and pale tongue. The biological indicators of Qi<GPE> deficiency related were blood lipids, ECG<ORGANIZATION>, blood rheology, inflammatory reaction, NO<ORGANIZATION>, ET<ORGANIZATION> and NF-ÎºB signalling pathway. The Qi deficiency syndrome on the level of syndrome spectrum was studied by the method of literature mining, which would provide reliable characteristic guidance data for the research on the substantial basis of Qi<GPE> deficiency, the research on standard of diagnosis, establishment of syndrome model, the study on combination of disease and syndrome and the mechanism of prescriptions.
