 Paraoxonase-1 ( PON1<ORGANIZATION> ) is a high-density lipoprotein-associated esterase and is speculated to play a role in several human diseases including diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Low PON1<PERSON> activity has been associated with increased risk of major cardiovascular events, therefore a variety of studies have been conducted to establish the cardioprotective properties and clinical relevance of PON1<ORGANIZATION>. The major aim of this review was to highlight the important studies and to subsequently assess if PON1<ORGANIZATION> has clinical relevance. A review of the literature showed that there is currently insufficient data to suggest that PON1<ORGANIZATION> has clinical relevance. It is our opinion that robust studies are required to clarify the clinical relevance of PON1<ORGANIZATION>.
