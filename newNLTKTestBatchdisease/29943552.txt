 The hepatitis B virus ( HBV<ORGANIZATION> ) envelope contains small ( S ), middle ( M ), and large ( L ) proteins. PreS1 of the L protein contains a receptor-binding motif crucial for HBV<ORGANIZATION> infection. This motif is highly conserved among 10 HBV genotypes ( A-J ), making it a potential target for the prevention of HBV<ORGANIZATION> infection. In this study, we successfully generated a neutralizing human monoclonal antibody ( mAb<ORGANIZATION> ), 1A8 ( IgG1<ORGANIZATION> ), that recognizes the receptor-binding motif of preS1 using a phage-displayed human synthetic Fab library. Analysis of the antigen-binding activity of 1A8 for different genotypes indicates that it can specifically bind to the preS1 of major HBV<ORGANIZATION> genotypes ( A-D ). Based on Bio-Layer interferometry, the affinity ( K
