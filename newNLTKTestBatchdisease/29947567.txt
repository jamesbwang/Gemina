 The RPE65<ORGANIZATION> gene was recently described to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa ( adRP<ORGANIZATION> ), presenting with a phenotype resembling choroideremia. This study presents the 2-year progression of RPE65<ORGANIZATION> adRP in a patient. This is an observational case report of one patient. The patient received a full ophthalmic examination during both visits, including diagnostic imaging such as spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ), OCT-angiography ( OCT-A ), short-wave fundus autofluorescence ( FAF<ORGANIZATION> ), and fundus photography. Genetic characterization was obtained by DNA<ORGANIZATION> sequencing from peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained during the first visit. RPE65<ORGANIZATION> adRP phenocopied choroideremia at the initial fundoscopy. Upon the patient 's return to our clinic 2 years later, DNA<ORGANIZATION> sequencing revealed a heterozygous mutation in the RPE65<ORGANIZATION> gene. Diagnostic<PERSON> imaging by SD-OCT and FAF<ORGANIZATION> suggested disease progression. In conjunction with clinical examination and imaging, the diagnosis was revised to adRP caused by RPE65<ORGANIZATION>. adRP<ORGANIZATION> due to a mutation in the gene encoding RPE65<ORGANIZATION> phenocopied choroideremia. Based on our analysis of the 2-year disease progression in this patient, RPE65<ORGANIZATION> adRP<ORGANIZATION> is mild and has a slow rate of disease progression.
