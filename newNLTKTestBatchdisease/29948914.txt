 Osteoporosis<GPE> ( OP ) is a disease associated with bone loss and microstructure degradation. Recent studies have shown that iron accumulation may be a risk factor for OP<ORGANIZATION>. Bone<PERSON> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) are multipotent cells and precursors to osteoblasts. MSCs<ORGANIZATION> play an important role in OP. Therefore, we evaluated the correlation between MSCs<ORGANIZATION> and OP in an environment of iron accumulation. Serum P1NP<PERSON> was decreased in iron accumulation mice. Micro-CT revealed that iron accumulation decreased bone mineral density and spatial structural parameters. Iron<PERSON> accumulation inhibited MSC<ORGANIZATION> quantity in bone marrow. However, the iron chelator deferoxamine ( DFO<ORGANIZATION> ) rescued the suppression. Iron<PERSON> accumulation also changed the MSC<ORGANIZATION> cell cycle. Iron<PERSON> elevated MSC<ORGANIZATION> cell ROS<ORGANIZATION> level and NOX4<ORGANIZATION> protein expression. MSC<ORGANIZATION> apoptosis was increased, and more caspase3 was cleaved after iron intervention. Our data suggests that iron accumulation inhibits MSC<ORGANIZATION> quantity and induces MSC<ORGANIZATION> apoptosis. Bone<PERSON> loss from iron accumulation may correlate with the inhibition of MSCs<ORGANIZATION>.
