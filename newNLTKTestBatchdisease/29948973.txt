 To assess the impact of bloodstream infection ( BSI<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with head and neck cancer ( HNC<ORGANIZATION> ) in the cetuximab era. We prospectively analysed the epidemiology, microbiology and outcomes of 51 BSI episodes occurring in 48 patients with HNC<ORGANIZATION> ( 2006-2017 ). We performed a retrospective matched-cohort study ( 1:2 ) to determine the risk factors for BSI<ORGANIZATION>. Finally, we compared patients who died with those who survived to identify risk factors for mortality. The most frequent HNC<ORGANIZATION> localization was the oropharynx ( 43 % ), and pneumonia was the most frequent source ( 25 % ). Gram-positive BSI<ORGANIZATION> occurred in 55 % cases, mainly due to Streptococcus<GPE> pneumoniae ( 21 % ), and among Gram-negatives, Escherichia<GSP> coli, Pseudomonas<GPE> aeruginosa, and Klebsiella<ORGANIZATION> pneumoniae were the most frequent. Hypoalbuminemia<GPE> ( OR 8.4 ; 95 % CI, 3.5-19.9 ), previous chemotherapy ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 3.2 ; 95 % CI, 1.3-7.4 ) and cetuximab therapy ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 2.8 ; 95 % CI, 1.6-6.7 ) were significant risk factors for BSI<ORGANIZATION>. Patients with BSI<ORGANIZATION> had a higher overall case-fatality rate than patients without BSI<ORGANIZATION> ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 4.4 ; 95 % CI, 1.7-11.8 ). Hypoalbuminemia<PERSON> was an independent risk factor for the early ( 7 day ) and overall ( 30 day ) case-fatalities, with ORs<ORGANIZATION> of 0.8 ( 95 % CI, 0.6-0.9 ) and 0.8 ( 95 % CI, 0.7-0.97 ), respectively. The presence of comorbidities ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 7 ; 95 % CI, 1.4-34 ) was also an independent risk factor for overall case-fatality. BSI<ORGANIZATION> causes high mortality in patients with HNC<ORGANIZATION> and is most often secondary to pneumonia. It occurs mainly among patients with hypoalbuminemia who receive treatment with cetuximab or chemotherapy. The development of BSI<ORGANIZATION> in patients with HNC<ORGANIZATION> impairs their outcome, especially in the presence of hypoalbuminemia and comorbidities.
