 BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the load-bearing capacities of three-unit direct resin-bonded fiber-reinforced composite fixed dental prosthesis with different framework designs. MATERIAL<ORGANIZATION> AND METHODS Sixty<ORGANIZATION> mandibular premolar and molar teeth without caries were collected and direct glass fiber-resin fixed FDPs<ORGANIZATION> were divided into 6 groups ( n=10 ). Each group was restored via direct technique with different designs. In Group 1, the inlay-retained bridges formed 2 unidirectional FRC<ORGANIZATION> frameworks and pontic-reinforced transversal FRC<ORGANIZATION>. In Group 2, the inlay-retained bridges were supported by unidirectional lingual and occlusal FRC<ORGANIZATION> frameworks. Group 3, had buccal and lingual unidirectional FRC<ORGANIZATION> frameworks without the inlay cavities. Group 4 had reinforced inlay cavities and buccal-lingual FRC<ORGANIZATION> with unidirectional FRC<ORGANIZATION> frameworks. Group 5, had a circular form of fiber reinforcement around cusps in addition to buccal-lingual FRC<ORGANIZATION> frameworks. Group 6 had a circular form of fiber reinforcement around cusps with 2 bidirectional FRC<ORGANIZATION> frameworks into inlay cavities. All groups were loaded until final fracture using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. RESULTS Mean<ORGANIZATION> values of the groups were determined with ANOVA<ORGANIZATION> and Tukey HSD<PERSON>. When all data were evaluated, Group 6 had the highest load-bearing capacities and revealed significant differences from Group 3 and Group 4. Group 6 had the highest strain ( p > 0.05 ). When the fracture patterns were investigated, Group 6 had the durability to sustain fracture propagation within the restoration. CONCLUSIONS The efficiency of fiber reinforcement of the restorations alters not only the amount of fiber, but also the design of the restoration with fibers.
