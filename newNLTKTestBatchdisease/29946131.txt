 Alcohol<GPE> use disorder ( AUD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a strong risk factor for development and mortality of pneumonia. Mucociliary clearance, a key innate defense against pneumonia, is perturbed by alcohol use. Specifically, ciliated airway cells lose the ability to increase ciliary beat frequency ( CBF<ORGANIZATION> ) to Î²-agonist stimulation after prolonged alcohol exposure. We previously found that alcohol activates protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1<ORGANIZATION> ) through a redox mechanism to cause ciliary dysfunction. Therefore, we hypothesized that PP1<ORGANIZATION> activity is enhanced by alcohol exposure through an S-nitrosothiol-dependent mechanism resulting in desensitization of CBF<ORGANIZATION> stimulation. Bronchoalveolar S-nitrosothiol<PERSON> ( SNO<ORGANIZATION> ) content and tracheal PP1<ORGANIZATION> activity was increased in wild-type ( WT ) mice drinking alcohol for 6-weeks compared to control mice. In contrast, alcohol drinking did not increase SNO<ORGANIZATION> content or PP1<ORGANIZATION> activity in nitric oxide synthase 3-deficient mice. S-nitrosoglutathione induced PP1-dependent CBF<ORGANIZATION> desensitization in mouse tracheal rings, cultured cells and isolated cilia. In vitro expression of mutant PP1<ORGANIZATION> ( cysteine 155 to alanine ) in primary human airway epithelial cells prevented CBF<ORGANIZATION> desensitization after prolonged alcohol exposure compared to cells expressing WT<ORGANIZATION> PP1. Thus, redox modulation in the airways by alcohol is an important ciliary regulatory mechanism. Pharmacologic strategies to reduce S-nitrosation may enhance mucociliary clearance and reduce pneumonia prevalence, mortality and morbidity with AUD<ORGANIZATION>.
