 This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on metabolic profiles in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD<ORGANIZATION> ). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed among 60 diabetic patients with CHD<ORGANIZATION>, aged 40-85 years at a cardiology clinic in Kashan<GPE>, Iran<GPE>, from October 2017 through January 2018. Patients were randomly divided into two groups to take either probiotic supplements ( n = 30 ) or placebo ( n = 30 ) for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken at the beginning of the study and after the 12-week intervention to determine related markers. After 12-week intervention, probiotic supplementation significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose ( Î² - 20.02 mg/dL ; 95 % CI<ORGANIZATION> - 33.86, - 6.17 ; Overall<GPE>, we found that probiotic supplementation for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on glycemic control, HDL-cholesterol, total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio, biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetic patients with CHD<ORGANIZATION>.
