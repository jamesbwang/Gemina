 Chronic wasting disease ( CWD<ORGANIZATION> ), a fatal neurodegenerative prion disease of cervids, has spread across North America<GPE> and has been detected in The Republic of Korea<ORGANIZATION>, Finland<GPE> and Norway<GPE>. CWD<ORGANIZATION> appears to spread by horizontal transmission, and prions shed in saliva, feces and urine are thought to contribute. However, studies investigating the rapid spread of CWD<ORGANIZATION> have been hampered by assay inhibitors and a lack of consistent and sensitive means to detect the relatively low levels of prions in these samples. Here we show that saliva frequently contains an inhibitor of the real-time quaking-induced conversion assay ( RT-QuIC ), and that the inhibitor is a member of the mucin family. To circumvent the inhibitor, we developed a modified PMCA<ORGANIZATION> method to amplify CWD<ORGANIZATION> prions in saliva that were undetectable or ambiguous by RT-QuIC. Our results reinforce the impact of saliva in horizontal CWD<ORGANIZATION> transmission and highlight the importance of detection optimization.
