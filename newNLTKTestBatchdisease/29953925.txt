 Apathy<GPE> is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson<GPE> 's disease ( PD ). We aimed to explore its associated neural substrates changes via amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations ( ALFF<ORGANIZATION> ) and granger causality analysis ( GCA<ORGANIZATION> ). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs-fMRI ) scans were performed in 20 PD patients with apathy ( PD-A ), 22 PD patients without apathy ( PD-NA ) and 19 healthy volunteers. GCA<ORGANIZATION>, a new method exploring direction from one brain region to another, was based on brain regions showing alterations of neural activity as seeds, which were examined utilizing ALFF<ORGANIZATION> approach. The relationships between ALFF<ORGANIZATION> or GCA<ORGANIZATION> and apathetic symptoms were also assessed. Relative to PD-NA group, PD-A group indicated decreased ALFF<ORGANIZATION> in left orbital middle frontal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus ( SFG<ORGANIZATION> ). Only ALFF<ORGANIZATION> values in right SFG were negatively correlated with Apathy Scale<PERSON> ( AS ) scores. Then GCA<ORGANIZATION> with the seed of right SFG<ORGANIZATION> showed a positive feedback from right thalamus to ipsilateral SFG<ORGANIZATION>, which was positively correlated with AS scores. In conclusion, dysfunction in SFG<ORGANIZATION> and a positive feedback from thalamus to ipsilateral SFG<ORGANIZATION> contributed to presence of PD-related apathy, providing a new perspective for future studies on apathy in PD.
