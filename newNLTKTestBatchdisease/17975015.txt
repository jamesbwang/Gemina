 A decision-analytic model was developed to study the impact of induction regimens vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone ( VAD<ORGANIZATION> ) ; thalidomide, dexamethasone ( TD ) ; and bortezomib, dexamethasone ( BorD<ORGANIZATION> ), followed by autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT<ORGANIZATION> ) for treating multiple myeloma ( MM ) patients in Macedonia<GPE>. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA<ORGANIZATION> ) of treatment sequences to predict health effects and costs of different treatment sequences was performed. Model strategies were based on a previously published study for treating patients with MM<ORGANIZATION> in Macedonia<GPE>. The data on disease progression and treatment effectiveness were obtained from the published reports of randomized clinical trials ( GIMEMA<ORGANIZATION> M-B02005, IFM<ORGANIZATION> 2005-01 ). Utility parameters were extracted from the literature. To compare treatment combinations, a decision tree model was developed. Additionally, a cost analysis for one-time per-protocol costs was performed from a Macedonian<GPE> national health care perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICERs<ORGANIZATION> ) /quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs<ORGANIZATION> ) gained for 1-, 10-, and 20-year time horizons were determined. Costs and health outcomes were discounted to evaluate the effects of time in the model. The one-time costs of BorD<ORGANIZATION> ( EUR<ORGANIZATION> 5,656 ) were higher compared to VAD<ORGANIZATION> ( EUR<ORGANIZATION> 303 ) and TD<ORGANIZATION> ( EUR<ORGANIZATION> 329 ), increasing the overall costs for BorD<ORGANIZATION>. Thus, the BorD<ORGANIZATION> combination dominated in the baseline results ( 1 and 10 years ) and the ICER<ORGANIZATION> for TD<ORGANIZATION> vs. VAD<ORGANIZATION> was EUR<ORGANIZATION> 7,564/QALY ( 20 years, undiscounted model ). However, in the discounted 20-year model, BorD<ORGANIZATION> showed an ICER of EUR<ORGANIZATION> 138,747/QALY gained for BorD<ORGANIZATION> vs. TD. The CEA<ORGANIZATION> performed indicated that considering 1-year time horizon costs, VAD<ORGANIZATION> may be a cost-effective alternative vs. TD or BorD<ORGANIZATION>. However, for the longer period ( 10 or 20 years ) including the discounting of future costs and outcomes, the TD<ORGANIZATION> and BorD<ORGANIZATION> combinations showed higher health benefits in terms of QALYs<ORGANIZATION> and more cost-effective vs. VAD<ORGANIZATION>. These results should be considered as supportive evidence by decision-makers and providers when deciding on the most cost-effective induction treatment strategy prior to ASCT<ORGANIZATION> in MM patients.
