 Bombyx<GPE> mori larvae exhibit in vivo defensive reactions immediately after invasion by a virus. One of these defense systems is to express appropriate microRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) to respond to the infection. A novel Bombyx mori-encoded miRNA<ORGANIZATION>, bmo-miR-390, was identified previously by high-throughput sequencing. Based on bioinformatic predictions, the Bombyx<ORGANIZATION> mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus cg30 gene ( BmNPV-cg30 ) is one of the target genes of bmo-miR-390. In this study, expression vectors with an enhanced green fluorescence protein ( EGFP<ORGANIZATION> ) or a luciferase ( luc ) reporter gene together with bm-miR-390 or the cg30 3 ' UTR were constructed and used to co-transfect BmN<ORGANIZATION> cells. Using a dual luciferase reporter ( DLR<ORGANIZATION> ) assay, we found that bmo-miR-390 significantly downregulates the expression of BmNPV-cg30 ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) in vitro. Moreover, artificially synthesized bmo-miR-390 mimics enhanced the regulatory effect of bmo-miR-390, while an inhibitor eliminated the inhibitory effect. These results show for the first time that bmo-miR-390 can effectively downregulate the expression of BmNPV-cg30 in BmNPV-infected BmN cells.
