 Like tumour cells, during intraerythrocytic stage, Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes rely completely on glucose absorption from the blood circulation for energy metabolism. Glucose<PERSON> is taken up by glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT1<ORGANIZATION> ) on human red blood cells ( RBCs<ORGANIZATION> ) and glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4<ORGANIZATION> ) on rodent RBCs<ORGANIZATION>. Blood-stage parasites grow rapidly ; therefore, infected red blood cells ( iRBCs<ORGANIZATION> ) need much more glucose for energy. In previous study, WZB117<GPE> ( 2-fluoro-6- ( m-hydroxybenzoyloxy ) phenyl m-hydroxybenzoate ) inhibits GLUT1<ORGANIZATION> by binding the exofacial sugar-binding site and inhibits the insulin-sensitive GLUT4 with greater potency than its inhibition of either GLUT1 or GLUT3<ORGANIZATION>. In our study, WZB117<ORGANIZATION> effectively inhibit the growth of blood-stage parasites. Mechanistically, WZB117<ORGANIZATION> inhibited the activity of GLUTs<ORGANIZATION> and perturbed the glycolysis. Therefore, decreasing the glucose level increased the redox oxidative species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ) level and induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. The spleen can more easily clear apoptopic iRBCs than nonapoptotic iRBCs<ORGANIZATION>, effectively relieving hepatosplenomegaly. These findings provide important insights into the crucial role of glucose transporters ( GLUTs<ORGANIZATION> ) in Plasmodium<GPE> glucose uptake during intra-erythrocytic stage, as the inhibition of GLUTs<ORGANIZATION> block Plasmodium infection during the erythrocytic stage.
