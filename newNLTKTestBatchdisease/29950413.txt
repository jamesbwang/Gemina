 The mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental damage caused by virus infections remain poorly defined. Congenital<ORGANIZATION> human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection is the leading cause of fetal brain development disorders. Previous work has linked HCMV<ORGANIZATION> to perturbations of neural cell fate, including premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells ( NPCs<ORGANIZATION> ). Here we show that HCMV<ORGANIZATION> infection of NPCs<ORGANIZATION> results in the loss of the SOX2<ORGANIZATION> protein, a key pluripotency-associated transcription factor. SOX2<ORGANIZATION> depletion maps to the HCMV<ORGANIZATION> major immediate-early ( IE ) transcription unit and is individually mediated by the IE1<ORGANIZATION> and IE2<ORGANIZATION> proteins. IE1<ORGANIZATION> causes SOX2<ORGANIZATION> down-regulation by promoting the nuclear accumulation and inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT3<ORGANIZATION>, a transcriptional activator of SOX2<ORGANIZATION> expression. Deranged signaling resulting in depletion of a critical stem cell protein is an unanticipated mechanism by which the viral major IE proteins may contribute to brain development disorders caused by congenital HCMV<ORGANIZATION> infection.
