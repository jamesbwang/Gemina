 Papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC<ORGANIZATION> ) is a common endocrine malignancy with relatively good prognosis. Radioactive iodine ( RAI<ORGANIZATION> ) is considered effective for patients with total or nearly total thyroidectomy, but the beneficial effects of RAI<ORGANIZATION> are still controversial. To determine whether RAI<ORGANIZATION> therapy could improve the survival rates of PTC<ORGANIZATION> patients, we conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the National Cancer Institute<ORGANIZATION> 's Surveillance, Epidemiology<GPE>, and End Results<PERSON> ( SEER<ORGANIZATION> ) program. Disease-specific survival ( DSS<ORGANIZATION> ) was obtained using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regressions. DSS<ORGANIZATION> was improved by RAI<ORGANIZATION> ablation in patients with tumor > 2 cm, age > 45 years and gross extrathyroidal or lymph node metastasis. In a further analysis, RAI<ORGANIZATION> therapy did not improve the DSS<ORGANIZATION> in patients with tumor < 2 cm except those with distant metastasis. For patients with tumor > 2 cm, those involving gross extrathyroidal extension, age > 45 years or disease in the lymph nodes, DSS<ORGANIZATION> was improved after RAI<ORGANIZATION> therapy. Patients with distant metastasis always benefited from RAI<ORGANIZATION> ablation. RAI<ORGANIZATION> ablation should be recommended to patients with tumor < 2 cm and distant metastasis or patients with tumor > 2 cm and one of the following risk factors: gross extrathyroidal extension, age > 45 years, lymph node and distant metastases.
