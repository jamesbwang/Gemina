 Autism<GPE> spectrum disorder ( ASD<ORGANIZATION> ) is characterised by the concomitant occurrence of impaired social interaction ; restricted, perseverative and stereotypical behaviour ; and abnormal communication skills. Recent epidemiological studies have reported a dramatic increase in the prevalence of ASD<ORGANIZATION> with as many as 1 in every 59 children being diagnosed with ASD<ORGANIZATION>. The fact that ASD<ORGANIZATION> appears to be principally genetically driven, and may be reversible postnatally, has raised the exciting possibility of using gene therapy as a disease-modifying treatment. Such therapies have already started to seriously impact on human disease and particularly monogenic disorders ( e.g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, SMA<ORGANIZATION> type 1 ). In regard to ASD<ORGANIZATION>, technical advances in both our capacity to model the disorder in animals and also our ability to deliver genes to the central nervous system ( CNS<ORGANIZATION> ) have led to the first preclinical studies in monogenic ASD<ORGANIZATION>, involving both gene replacement and silencing. Furthermore, our increasing awareness and understanding of common dysregulated pathways in ASD<ORGANIZATION> have broadened gene therapy 's potential scope to include various polygenic ASDs<ORGANIZATION>. As this review highlights, despite a number of outstanding challenges, gene therapy has excellent potential to address cognitive dysfunction in ASD<ORGANIZATION>.
