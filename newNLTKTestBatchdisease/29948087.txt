 To evaluate non-intravenously enhanced low-dose computed tomography with oral contrast ( LDCT<ORGANIZATION> ) for the assessment of pregnant women with right lower quadrant pain, when magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) is not immediately available. One hundred and thirty-eight consecutive pregnant women with acute abdominal pain were admitted in our emergency centre. Thirty-seven ( 27 % ) of them, with clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis, underwent abdominal ultrasonography ( US<ORGANIZATION> ). No further examination was recommended when US<GPE> was positive for appendicitis, negative with low clinical suspicion or showed an alternative diagnosis which explained the clinical presentation. All other patients underwent LDCT<ORGANIZATION> ( < 2.5 mSv ). Standard<PERSON> intravenously enhanced CT or MRI<ORGANIZATION> was performed when LDCT<ORGANIZATION> was indeterminate. Eight ( 22 % ) of 37 US<GPE> exams were reported normal, 25 ( 67 % ) indeterminate, 1 ( 3 % ) positive for appendicitis, 3 ( 8 % ) positive for an alternative diagnosis. LDCT<ORGANIZATION> was obtained in 29 ( 78 % ) patients. It was reported positive for appendicitis in 9 ( 31 % ), for alternative diagnosis in 2 ( 7 % ), normal in 13 ( 45 % ) and indeterminate in 5 ( 17 % ). Further imaging ( standard CT or MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) showed appendicitis in 2 of these 5 patients, was truly negative in 1, indeterminate in 1 and falsely positive in 1. An appendicitis was confirmed at surgery in 12 ( 32 % ) of the 37 patients. The sensitivity and the specificity of the algorithm for appendicitis were 100 % ( 12/12 ) and 92 % ( 23/25 ), respectively. The proposed algorithm is very sensitive and specific for detection of acute appendicitis in pregnant women ; it reduces the need of standard CTs when MRI<ORGANIZATION> is not available as second-line imaging. • In pregnant women, US<GSP> is limited by an important number of indeterminate results • Low-dose CT can be used after an inconclusive US<ORGANIZATION> for the diagnosis of appendicitis in pregnant women • An algorithm integrating US<ORGANIZATION> and low-dose CT is highly sensitive and specific for appendicitis in pregnant women.
