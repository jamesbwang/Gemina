 The endothelin axis ( endothelins and their receptors ) is strongly involved in physiological and pathological processes. ET-1 plays a crucial role in particular in tumor diseases. Endothelin-1 receptors ( ET<ORGANIZATION> ( A ) and ET<ORGANIZATION> ( B ) ) are deregulated and overexpressed in several tumors such as melanoma and glioma. We studied the binding of 24 monoclonal antibodies directed against human ET ( B ) receptors ( hET<ORGANIZATION> ( B ) ) to different melanoma cell lines. Few of these mAbs bound to all the melanoma cell lines. One of them, rendomab B49<PERSON>, bound to ET<GPE> ( B ) receptors expressed at the surface of human glioma stem cells. More recently, we produced new antibodies directed against human ET ( A ) receptor ( hET<ORGANIZATION> ( A ) ). Several antibodies have been isolated and have been screened on different tumoral cells lines. As for the mAbs<ORGANIZATION> directed against the hET<ORGANIZATION> ( B ) receptor only some of new antibodies directed against ET<GPE> ( A ) receptor are capable to bind the human tumoral cell lines. Rendomab A63<PERSON> directed against hET<ORGANIZATION> ( A ) is one of them. We report the specificity and binding properties of these mAbs and consider their potential use in diagnosis by an in vivo imaging approach.
