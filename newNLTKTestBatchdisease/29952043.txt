 Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion ( II/R ) injury is a serious clinical problem. The aim of the present work was to investigate novel mechanisms and new drug targets associated with microRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in regulating II/R injury. Hypoxia/reoxygenation ( H/R ) model in IEC-6 cells and II/R models in rats and mice were tested. Microarray<PERSON> assay was used to investigate the target miRNAs from intestinal tissues of rats. The methods of real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION>, western blot and dual luciferase reporter assays, and agomir and antagomir in vitro and in vivo were used to elucidate the functions of the target miRNA in controlling II/R injury. The differentially expressed miR-351-5p while targeting MAPK13<ORGANIZATION> and Sirt6<PERSON> was found, which significantly reduced the levels of Sirt6<GPE> and AMPK<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation, activated FoxO3<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation to cause oxidative stress. In addition, miR-351-5p markedly reduced MAPK13<ORGANIZATION> level, activated PKD1/NF-κB signal, increased NF-κB ( p65 ) level to promote inflammation. Moreover, miR-351-5p obviously up-regulated the levels of Bax<GPE>, Cytc<PERSON>, Apaf-1, cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-caspase 9 by reducing Sirt6<PERSON> level to promote apoptosis. In addition, miR-351-5p mimic in IEC-6 cells and agomir in mice aggravated these effects, and miR-351-5p inhibitor and antagomir in mice alleviated these actions. In summary, miR-351-5p aggravated II/R injury by promoting intestinal mucosal oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis via targeting MAPK13<ORGANIZATION> and Sirt6<PERSON>. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of miR-351-5p in regulating II/R injury via targeting Sirt6<PERSON> and MAPK13<ORGANIZATION>, which should be considered as one novel therapeutic target to treat the disease.
