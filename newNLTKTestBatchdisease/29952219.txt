 Idiopathic<GPE> pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF<ORGANIZATION> ) is a devastating interstitial lung disease with increasing mortality and poor prognosis. The current understanding of the role of long non-coding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) in IPF<ORGANIZATION> remain limited. In the present study, we identified a lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> NONMMUT022554<ORGANIZATION>, designated pulmonary fibrosis-regulatory lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> ( PFRL<ORGANIZATION> ), with unknown functions and found that its levels were increased in fibrotic lung tissues of mice and pulmonary fibroblasts exposed to TGF-β1. Furthermore, we found that enforced expression of PFRL<ORGANIZATION> induced fibroblast activation and collagen deposition, which could be mitigated by the overexpression of miR-26a. By contrast, the inhibition of PFRL<ORGANIZATION> could markedly alleviate the TGF-β1-induced up-regulation of fibrotic markers and attenuate fibroblast proliferation and differentiation by regulating miR-26a. Meanwhile, our study confirmed that PFRL<ORGANIZATION> inhibited the expression and activity of miR-26a, which has been identified as an anti-fibrotic miRNA in our previous study. Interestingly, our molecular study further confirmed that Smad2<PERSON> transcriptionally inhibits the expression of miR-26a and that the miR-26a/Smad2 feedback loop mediates the pro-fibrotic effects of PFRL<ORGANIZATION> in lung fibrosis. More importantly, knockdown of PFRL<ORGANIZATION> ablated BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicate that lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> PFRL<ORGANIZATION> contributes to the progression of lung fibrosis by modulating the reciprocal repression between miR-26a and Smad2<PERSON> and that this lncRNA may be a therapeutic target for IPF<ORGANIZATION>.
