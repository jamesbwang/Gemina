 To evaluate disease characteristics and long-term outcomes in patients requiring second-line treatment following FCR<ORGANIZATION>, for relapsed/refractory disease ( R/R ), or following discontinuation due to toxicities. A retrospective analysis of 126 CLL patients treated with frontline FCR: 63 received second-line treatment ( 41 relapsed, 9 refractory ( SD/PD ), 13 prior toxicity ). Time to next treatment ( TTNT<ORGANIZATION> ) was calculated from beginning FCR<ORGANIZATION> to initiation of second-line therapy. Overall and event-free survival were calculated from initiation of salvage treatment ( OS2/EFS2 ). Median<GPE> follow-up for the entire cohort was 67 months ( m ) and 37m from second-line therapy. TTNT<ORGANIZATION> < 24m was associated with shorter OS2<ORGANIZATION> and EFS2<ORGANIZATION> similar to those observed with primary refractory disease ( OS2<ORGANIZATION> 19m and 23m ; EFS2 12m and 9m for TTNT<ORGANIZATION> < 24m and SD/PD respectively ). TTNTâ‰¥24m ( 71 % chemotherapy based second-line ), had longer OS2<ORGANIZATION> and EFS2<ORGANIZATION> ( 48m and 20m ). Among the 13 patients receiving second-line therapy after discontinuing FCR<ORGANIZATION> due to toxicity EFS2<ORGANIZATION> was 41m ( 59m from initiation of FCR<ORGANIZATION> ). With limitations of sample size and treatment heterogeneity, patients progressing < 24m following FCR<ORGANIZATION> have poor outcomes, similar to refractory patients, while longer remissions are indicative of a chemoimmunotherapy sensitive disease. Patients who discontinue FCR<ORGANIZATION> for toxicities may achieve excellent outcomes with subsequent treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
