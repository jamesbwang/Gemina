 Exogenous<GPE> lipoid pneumonia is a rare alveolar-filling disorder characterized by foreign body reaction to inhaled/aspirated hydrocarbon that may be vegetable oil, animal fat, or mineral oil. It is vanishingly rare and often missed except in the classical clinical settings of acute aspiration of petroleum products. We present a toddler with iatrogenic exogenous lipoid pneumonia and highlight clinical and radiological clues that can prompt early recognition of this entity.
