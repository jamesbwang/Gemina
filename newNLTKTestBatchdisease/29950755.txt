 Degenerative<GPE> aortic stenosis is a disease of the elderly and of growing importance in an ageing population. Due<PERSON> to the impaired life-expectancy of patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, valve replacement should be performed. Surgical aortic valve replacement is the gold standard treatment ; however, median sternotomy and use of extracorporal circulation is a risk for elderly patients with comorbidities. The introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI<ORGANIZATION> ) into clinical practice has revolutionized treatment of aortic stenosis in elderly patients. In most patients, TAVI<ORGANIZATION> can be performed through the groin vessels using local anaesthesia. Most patients fully recover within a few days. Current debate focuses on whether TAVI<ORGANIZATION> should also be used to treat younger patients as data on long-term durability of these valves is insufficient and there is a remaining risk of paravalvular leackage.
