 Whether statins and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs<ORGANIZATION> ) / angiotensin receptor blockors ( ARBs<ORGANIZATION> ) are associated with reduced risks of infection events is still inconclusive. This study aimed to explore the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia among patients who had received treatment with ACEIs/ARBs and/or statins using a population-based dataset. This study included 19,281 patients as cases who were hospitalized for pneumonia and 19,281 controls. We used a logistic regression to compute the odds ratio ( OR ) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) for having previously used statins or an ACEI/ ARB between patients who were hospitalized for pneumonia treatment and controls. We found there were significant associations between hospitalization for pneumonia and statin-only users ( p < 0.001 ), ACEI/ARB-only users ( p < 0.001 ), and statin and ACEI/ARB users ( p < 0.001 ). The logistic regression analysis suggested that statin-only users ( adjusted OR = 0.38, 95 % CI = 0.34~0.43 ), ACEI/ARB-only users ( adjusted OR = 0.86, 95 % CI = 0.82~0.91 ), and statin and ACEI/ARB users ( adjusted OR = 0.47, 95 % CI = 0.44~0.50 ) were all less likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia treatment than were non-users. Furthermore, we found that statin-only users ( adjusted OR = 0.44, 95 % CI = 0.40~0.50 ) and statin and ACEI/ARB users ( adjusted OR = 0.55, 95 % CI = 0.52~0.58 ) were less likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia treatment compared to ACEI-only users. However, combined statin and ACEI/ARB users ( adjusted OR = 1.24, 95 % CI = 1.10~1.40 ) were more likely to have been hospitalized for pneumonia treatment compared to statin-only users. Although we found use of both statins and ACEI/ARB were significantly associated with a lower risk of pneumonia, the combination of the two medications did not provide additional protection against pneumonia risk.
