 Altered<GPE> ocular and cerebral vascular autoregulation and vasoreactivity have been demonstrated in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG<ORGANIZATION> ). In the present study, we investigated the correlations between reduced cerebral blood flow ( CBF<ORGANIZATION> ) in early and higher-tier visual cortical areas and glaucomatous changes in the retinas of patients with mild to moderate POAG<ORGANIZATION>. 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling ( ASL<ORGANIZATION> ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) at 3T was performed in twenty normal controls and fifteen mild to moderate POAG<ORGANIZATION> patients. Regions of interest were selected based on the Population-Average, Landmark- and Surface-based ( PALS<ORGANIZATION> ) atlas of the human cerebral cortex. ASL-measured CBF<ORGANIZATION> values were extracted in the early and higher-tier visual cortical areas and were compared between patients and controls using a two-sample t-test. Pearson<PERSON> correlation analyses were used to assess the correlations between reduced CBF<ORGANIZATION> and cup-to-disc ratio ( CDR<ORGANIZATION> ), retinal nerve fibre layer ( RNFL<ORGANIZATION> ) thickness, and ganglion cell complex ( GCC<ORGANIZATION> ) thickness. Reduced CBF<ORGANIZATION> in early visual cortical areas ( V1, V2<PERSON> and VP ) and in the higher-tier visual left lateral occipital cortex ( LO ) was presented in mild to moderate POAG<ORGANIZATION> patients compared with controls. Furthermore, reduced CBF<ORGANIZATION> of the right areas V2 and VP<ORGANIZATION> was correlated with CDR<ORGANIZATION>, total GCC<ORGANIZATION> thickness, and average RNFL<ORGANIZATION> thickness. In conclusion, the complex pathological progress of POAG<ORGANIZATION> includes abnormal cerebral perfusion within the visual cortex since the mild to moderate disease stages. The association of cerebral perfusion changes with alterations of the optic disc and the retina may contribute to the early diagnosis of POAG<ORGANIZATION>.
