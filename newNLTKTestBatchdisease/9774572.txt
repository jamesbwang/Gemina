 Chronic<GPE> periodontitis ( CP ) is an infectious disease resulting in inflammation of the supporting tissues of the teeth with progressive attachment loss and bone loss. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 980-nm diode laser, as an adjunct to scaling and root planing ( SRP<ORGANIZATION> ) in the management of CP<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 40 systemically healthy subjects diagnosed with CP<ORGANIZATION> were randomly assigned into two groups G1 ( SRP<ORGANIZATION> and sham application of laser ) and G2<GPE> ( SRP<ORGANIZATION> and laser irradiation ) with equal numbers in each. The levels of A gradual reduction in the levels of Although a 980-nm diode laser may not have any added benefit compared with SRP<ORGANIZATION>, it may emerge as an effective non-surgical treatment option in advanced periodontitis with complex inaccessible subgingival niches where comprehensive periodontal care may not be feasible.
