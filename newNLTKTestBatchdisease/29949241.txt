 Dehiscence<GPE> or palatal fistula formation following palatoplasty is a complication that has grave consequences for the patient that include tissue loss, emotional distress to the parents and patient, and further medical costs. Palatal<ORGANIZATION> dehiscence or fistula formation is multifactorial following surgery-tension of wound closure, poor patient adherence to postoperative orders and wound infection are the most common causes for this. Oral colonization with pathogenic organisms could play a role in wound healing complications. Identification of intraoral bacteria among patients with cleft palates has thus far not been performed. To identify the spectrum of intraoral bacteria in cleft palate patients in an African<GPE> setting ; a retrospective, chart review was performed at Inkosi<ORGANIZATION> Albert Luthuli Central<PERSON> Hospital-a quaternary hospital in Durban<GPE>, South Africa<GPE>. All patients with unrepaired cleft palates who underwent palatoplasty in 2015 were included. Fifty-two patients were included. Preoperative throat/palatal swabs were taken prior to palatoplasty. The various bacteria cultured from the aforementioned swabs were cataloged. Various bacteria were cultured. In total, 23 patients ( 44.2 % ) had positive swab cultures. Eighteen cultures ( 34.6 % ) had gram-positive growth only, four cultures ( 7.7 % ) had gram-negative growth only, while one patient ( 1.9 % ) cultured both a gram-positive and a gram-negative organism. Streptococcus viridans was the most commonly cultured organism ( 19.2 % ) while beta-hemolytic streptococci were cultured from only 4 swabs ( 7.7 % ). Our study cataloged the commonly occurring bacteria found in unrepaired cleft palate patients in Africa<GPE>. Further<PERSON> research into the clinical significance of each bacteria is advised.
