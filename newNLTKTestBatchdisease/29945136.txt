 Shunt<GPE> infections are common pediatric neurosurgical cases with high morbidity that almost always requires surgical removal of the shunt, external ventricular drain placement, and delayed shunt replacement. Tunnel infections are well-described clinical entities occurring with indwelling catheters, whereby the indwelling tunnel portion of a line becomes externally infected with a sterile central lumen. These infections are typically treated with line replacement or antibiotics depending on clinical circumstances. We describe 2 cases of shunt tunnel infection. Both cases presented as erythema over the thoracic portion of the shunt without signs of CNS<ORGANIZATION> infection, with only a remote history of shunt surgery and no recent systemic illness. One case was treated with a course of antibiotics, and the other with surgical removal and eventual replacement. Both children made full recoveries. Our case series juxtaposes 2 alternative successful strategies for treating the rare entity of shunt tunnel infection.
