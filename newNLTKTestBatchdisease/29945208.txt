 Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is an independent risk factor of colorectal cancer ( CRC<ORGANIZATION> ). Both genetic and epigentic events induce a unique molecular profile during the development from UC<ORGANIZATION> to UC-related CRC<ORGANIZATION> ( UCRC<ORGANIZATION> ). These molecular changes play varied roles in DNA<ORGANIZATION> repair, immune response, cell metabolism, and interaction with the microbiota during the carcinogenesis process. This review will systmatically discuss the molecular characteristics of UCRC<ORGANIZATION> and point out the future perspectives in this research field.
