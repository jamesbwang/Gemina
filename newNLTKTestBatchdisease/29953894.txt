 Some thyroid carcinomas ( TCs<ORGANIZATION> ) have a violent biological behavior and poor prognosis, and lacking of effective molecular markers is still the main obstacle for clinical stratified diagnosis and treatment of TC<ORGANIZATION>. The aim of the study was to discover the clinicopathological and prognostic implications of Src<GPE> homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 ( SHP2<ORGANIZATION> ) and Hook<GPE> microtubule tethering protein 1 ( Hook1 ) expression in TC. The expression of SHP2<ORGANIZATION> and Hook1was<ORGANIZATION> detected by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from 313 primary TC who underwent surgery during January 2006 and January 2010 in Zhejiang<GPE> Cancer Hospital. Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox<ORGANIZATION> proportional-hazards regression models were employed to analyze the associations between their expressions and clinicopathological features and prognosis. The expression rate of SHP2<ORGANIZATION> and Hook1<GPE> in TC was 57.5 % ( 180/313 ) and 22.0 % ( 69/313 ), respectively. SHP2<ORGANIZATION> was positively correlated with Hook1<PERSON> in TC. SHP2<ORGANIZATION> expression differed significantly by age, histological variants, maximal tumor diameter, intrathyroidal dissemination, metastases, and disease stage ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Moreover, Patients<PERSON> with high SHP2<ORGANIZATION> expression had reduced risk for death of disease compared to those with low SHP2<ORGANIZATION> expression ( Hazard<ORGANIZATION> ratio [ HR ] = 0.267, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ]: 0.105-0.684, P<PERSON> = 0.006 ) in univariate analysis, but that multivariate analysis failed to suggest that SHP2<ORGANIZATION> was an independent prognostic factor. Hook1<PERSON> expression differed significantly by histological variants, maximal tumor diameter, and intrathyroidal dissemination ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). However, there was no significant correlation between Hook1<GPE> expression and outcome in TC<GPE> ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). Our results suggested that SHP2<ORGANIZATION> may be a favorable indicator of prognosis in TC.
