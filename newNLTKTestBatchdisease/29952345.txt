 A total of 201 wild geckos from the region of Mekong Delta<GPE>, Vietnam<PERSON> were collected to determine the viable number and survival period of Salmonella<GPE> in their feces. Of the 101 samples examined, 24 ( 23.8 % ) were Salmonella<PERSON> positive. These 24 geckos excreted Salmonella<PERSON> in their feces in a range of 1 to 8.6 log CFU/g with a mean of 4.5 Â± 3.2 log CFU/g. Among the Salmonella<ORGANIZATION> serovars, Salmonella Weltevreden<PERSON> was the most predominant serovar ( 37.5 % ). Moreover, Salmonella<PERSON> could survive for 6 weeks in gecko feces at room temperature in Vietnam<GPE>. These results indicate that the wild gecko seems to play an important role as a reservoir for Salmonella<ORGANIZATION> and a source of Salmonella<GPE> infection in humans in Southeast<GPE> Asian<GPE> countries.
