 Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH<ORGANIZATION> ) is a hip disorder, and it threatens patients who require megadose of steroid therapies. Nowadays<PERSON>, no valid therapies can reverse the development of GC-induced ONFH once it occurs. Stem<PERSON> cell therapy to GC-induced ONFH would be a promising choice. Although the pathogenesis of GC-induced ONFH is not yet fully clear, Dickkopf-1 ( Dkk-1 ) upregulated by excessive GC use, which hinders the canonical Wnt pathway, could be an explanation. Thus, the aim of the present work lies in investigating the efficiency of the allograft bone marrow stem cells ( BMSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) with Dkk-1 interference in preventing the progression of the GC-induced ONFH. Lentivirus-meditated Dkk-1 RNAi<ORGANIZATION> was introduced into BMSCs<ORGANIZATION> which was exposed to dexamethasone ( 10
