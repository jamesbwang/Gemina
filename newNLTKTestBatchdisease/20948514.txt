 Circulating interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) improves outcome prediction for second primary cancer ( SPC<ORGANIZATION> ) in head and neck cancer ( HNC<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. This study aimed to identify factors associated with IL-6 serum levels in HNC<ORGANIZATION> patients. This study was conducted as part of a phase III<ORGANIZATION> chemoprevention trial. IL-6 was measured using chemiluminescent immunometric assay on pretreatment serum sample obtained from 527 stage I-II HNC<ORGANIZATION> patients. Patients<PERSON> ' lifestyle habits, sociodemographic, medical and tumor characteristics were evaluated before radiation therapy ( RT ). Factors independently associated with IL-6 levels before RT were identified using multiple linear regression. The median IL-6 serum level was 3.1 ng/L. In the multivariate analysis, eight factors were significantly associated ( Circulating IL-6 is a strong predictor of the occurrence of SPC<ORGANIZATION> in HNC<ORGANIZATION> patients. We identified eight factors independently associated with serum IL-6 levels in 527 stage I-II HNC<ORGANIZATION> patients.The dose-response relationship between lifetime smoking and IL-6 serum levels suggested a causal role of tobacco exposure on IL-6 production. Further studies are needed to establish whether the effect of tobacco exposure on SPC<ORGANIZATION> could be partly mediated by IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine.
