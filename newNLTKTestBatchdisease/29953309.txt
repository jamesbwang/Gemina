 To examine the spectrum of scleritis in four tertiary institutions across the Asia-Pacific. Clinical<PERSON> records from 354 patients were reviewed from centers in Australia<GPE>, Singapore<GPE>, and India<GPE>, excluding those with insufficient data ( n = 24 ). Indian<GPE> patients presented younger ( 41.5 ± 13.4 years ) than Australians<GPE> ( 50.8 ± 17.5 ) and Singaporeans<GPE> ( 48.6 ± 15.9 ), with fewer women ( 49 % vs 62 % /57 % ). Diffuse<PERSON> disease was universally most common. Autoimmune and infectious disease proportions were similar in Australia<GPE> ( 31 % /10.3 % ) and Singapore<GPE> ( 27.5 % /8.3 % ) but reversed in India<GPE> ( 8.3 % /30 % ). Necrotizing scleritis was most frequently associated with infection ( 27.3 % ). Presumed ocular tuberculosis accounted for 75 % of infectious cases in India<GPE>. Posterior<PERSON> scleritis had the highest complication rate ( 82.4 % ) and immunosuppressants used per patient ( 0.98 ± 0.31 95 % CI ). Clinical<PERSON> presentations of scleritis vary across the Asia-Pacific, particularly in endemic regions for tuberculosis such as India<GPE>, where it affects younger men with a predominance of nodular and infectious disease.
