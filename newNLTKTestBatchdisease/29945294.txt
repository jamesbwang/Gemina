 Pancreatic<GPE> ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC<ORGANIZATION> ) is a highly malignant tumor with few biomarkers to guide treatment options. Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 ( CA19.9 ), the mainly used biomarker for PDAC<ORGANIZATION>, is not sensitive and specific enough for the detection of the disease. This study was aimed to evaluate serum periostin ( POSTN<ORGANIZATION> ) and CA242<ORGANIZATION> as potential diagnostic biomarkers complementing CA19.9 in detecting pancreatic cancer. Blood samples were from 362 participants, including 213 patients with different stages of PDAC<ORGANIZATION>, 75 patients with benign pancreatic disease and 74 healthy individuals. All samples were randomly divided into training set and validation set. CA19.9, CA242<ORGANIZATION>, POSTN<ORGANIZATION>, as well as carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA<ORGANIZATION> ), were measured by ELISA<ORGANIZATION> or automated immunoassay. The receiver operating curve ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) analysis revealed that the performances of CA19.9 in the validation group were improved by the marker panel composed of CA19.9, POSTN<ORGANIZATION> and CA242<ORGANIZATION>, to discriminate early-stage PDAC not only from healthy controls ( AUC<ORGANIZATION>
