 A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients undergoing potentially curative gastrectomy for cancer ( GC ). Thomson<PERSON> Reuters Web of Science<GPE>, Ovid MEDLINE<PERSON> ( R ) and PUBMED<ORGANIZATION> databases were searched for relevant articles using search terms neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR<ORGANIZATION> ), GC<ORGANIZATION> and survival. Articles<PERSON> reporting overall survival ( OS ), cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival ( DFS<ORGANIZATION> ), in patients undergoing R0 gastrectomy, were studied. Articles numbering 365 were identified during the preliminary search, and 10 containing 4164 patients were included in the final review. Most patients were > 60 years of age, male ( 67 % ) and 2239 ( 53.8 % ) had pT3<ORGANIZATION> disease. The number of NLR<ORGANIZATION> dichotomization thresholds reported numbered 7, with 2.00 and 3.00 ( n = 2 ) the most common. NLR<ORGANIZATION> was associated with poor survival in eight studies with hazard ratios ranging from 1.54 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.26-1.89 ) to 2.99 ( 1.99-4.49 ). Pooled odds ratio ( OR ) for OS<ORGANIZATION> was 2.31 ( 1.40-3.83, p = 0.001 ) and for DFS<ORGANIZATION> 2.72 ( 1.14-6.54, p = 0.020 ). Four studies presented T-stage data, OR 1.62 ( 1.33-1.96, p < 0.001 ). NLR<ORGANIZATION> is an important prognostic indicator associated with both OS and DFS<ORGANIZATION> after R0<GPE> resection of GC<ORGANIZATION>, but the critical level is equivocal.
