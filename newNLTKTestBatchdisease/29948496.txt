 The PHASES<ORGANIZATION> score was developed to determine the risk of rupture of un-ruptured intracranial aneurysms ( UIAs<ORGANIZATION> ). The purposes of the current study were to apply this score on patients with actually ruptured intracranial aneurysms and to analyze the hypothetically prediction of the risk in this particularly patient group. We extracted the data of 100 recently treated patients ( 23 male, 77 female, mean age 56.4 years, range 17-93 years ) with ruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms from our prospectively maintained neurovascular database according to the parameters used in the PHASES<ORGANIZATION> score ( population, hypertension, age, earlier SAH<ORGANIZATION>, size and site of the aneurysm ). Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using SPSS<ORGANIZATION> for Windows<GPE> version 18.0 ( SPSS Inc.<ORGANIZATION>, Chicago<GPE>, Illinois<GPE>, USA<ORGANIZATION> ). Ninety-nine percent of the patients were European<GPE> and 1 % Japanese<GPE> in our series. Pre-existing arterial hypertension was found in 59 %. Fifteen percent of the patients were > 75 years. Earlier SAH<ORGANIZATION> was found in 1 %. The site of the aneurysms were the internal carotid artery ( ICA<ORGANIZATION> ) in 10 %, the middle cerebral artery ( MCA<ORGANIZATION> ) in 14 %, and arteries of the anterior and posterior circulation ( PC ) including the posterior communicating artery ( PCOM<ORGANIZATION> ) in 76 %. Sixty-six percent of the aneurysms were smaller than 7 mm, 18 % ranged between 7 and 9.9 mm, 14 % were between 10 and 19.9 mm, and 2 % were larger than 20 mm. European<GPE> population, aneurysm size < 7 mm, and age < 75 years scored with 0 point in the PHASES<ORGANIZATION> study occurred most frequently in our series. The distribution of the aneurysm site to the anterior and posterior circulation scored with 4 points occurred most frequently. Considering the 5-year risk of rupture, 70 % of our patient collective would have an estimated risk of < 2 %. Interestingly, 70 % of the patients with aneurysmal SAH<ORGANIZATION> had a low risk profile and would have a low risk of rupture according to the PHASES<ORGANIZATION> score in our series. This observation underlines the discrepancy of the estimated low risk of rupture for UIAs<ORGANIZATION> in young and healthy patients and the obvious fact the majority of the SAH<ORGANIZATION> patients are actually young with low risk factors. Parameters beyond the features of the PHASES<ORGANIZATION> score are needed to determine the risk of rupture of intracranial aneurysms.
