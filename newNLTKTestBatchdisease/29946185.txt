 Several immunohistochemistry ( IHC<ORGANIZATION> ) assays have been developed to assess tumor programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression levels in patients who are candidates for programmed death-1 ( PD-1 ) /PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. The PD-L1 IHC<ORGANIZATION> 28-8 pharmDx<ORGANIZATION> kit is FDA-approved as a complementary diagnostic and CE-marked as an in vitro diagnostic device for nivolumab therapy in melanoma and specific lung cancer subtypes ( and for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck/urothelial carcinoma in Europe<GPE> only ). Kit availability is limited outside the United States<GPE>, and its use requires the Dako Autostainer<ORGANIZATION> Link 48 platform, which is unavailable in many laboratories. Validated laboratory-developed tests based on 28-8 concentrated antibody outside the kit are needed. This study compared the results from PD-L1 expression level analysis across four immunohistochemistry platforms ( Dako Autostainer<ORGANIZATION> Link 48, Dako Omnis<PERSON>, Leica Bond-III<PERSON>, and Ventana BenchMark<PERSON> ULTRA ) with the 28-8 pharmDx<ORGANIZATION> kit in lung cancer ( multiple histologies ), melanoma, and head and neck cancer ( multiple histologies ). Samples<PERSON> were prepared per protocol for each platform and stained using PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx<ORGANIZATION> kit on Dako Autostainer<PERSON> Link 48, and per protocol for each platform. The control samples ( tonsil and placenta tissue ; cell lines with prespecified PD-L1 expression levels ) were tested to evaluate the specificity and the sensitivity of test assays. An agreement level of 0.90 with the pharmDx<ORGANIZATION> kit was set for each platform. Inter- and intra-assay reliability were assessed. Evaluable samples were lung cancer = 29 ; melanoma = 31 ; head and neck cancer = 30. Mean agreement was calculated for PD-L1 expression levels of ≥1 %, ≥5 %, ≥10 %, and ≥50 %. Mean overall agreement for all indications was 0.87-0.99. Inter- and intra-assay of scoring/classification repeatability was 100 %. Analysis of PD-L1 expression levels using laboratory-developed immunohistochemistry assays with 28-8 antibody may be permissible if the platform is validated using reference samples with defined expression levels.
