 Parenteral Nutrition<ORGANIZATION> ( PN ) is a life-saving treatment used for patients with Intestinal Failure<ORGANIZATION> ( IF ). PN is complex and demands highly specialised care to avoid serious complications in the home setting. All tertiary centres in the Republic of Ireland<ORGANIZATION> ( ROI<ORGANIZATION> ) were contacted to assess the prevalence of IF requiring PN<ORGANIZATION> and complications, over a one year period. Sixty-seven patients were treated across 15 centres: a period prevalence of 14.6 and 9.6 patients per million for long-term PN and home PN respectively. Three-quarters of patients experienced at least one major complication with 18 % mortality rate over the study period. There were 2.86 admissions per HPN<ORGANIZATION> patient, each lasting mean 13.4 days. One-third experienced catheter-related infections. There was a reduced length of stay during emergency re-admissions in high volume centres ( mean 31 v 43 days, p=0.17 ). The establishment of a National Centre<ORGANIZATION> for IF/HPN in ROI<ORGANIZATION> is integral to reducing PN-associated complications.
