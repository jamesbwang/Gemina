 Although there are various types of therapeutic footwear currently used to treat diabetic foot ulcers ( DFUs<ORGANIZATION> ), recent literature has enforced the concept that total-contact casts are the benchmark.Besides conventional clinical tests and imaging modalities, advanced MRI<ORGANIZATION> techniques and high-sensitivity nuclear medicine modalities present several advantages for the investigation of diabetic foot problems.The currently accepted principles of DFU<ORGANIZATION> care are rigorous debridement followed by modern wound dressings to provide a moist wound environment. Recently, hyperbaric oxygen and negative pressure wound therapy have aroused increasing attention as an adjunctive treatment for patients with DFUs.For DFU, various surgical treatments are currently available, including resection arthroplasty, metatarsal osteotomies and metatarsal head resections.In the modern management of the Charcot<ORGANIZATION> foot, surgery in the acute phase remains controversial and under investigation. While conventional fixation techniques are frequently insufficient to keep alignment postoperatively, superconstruct techniques could provide a successful fixation.Retrograde intramedullary nailing has been a generally accepted method of achieving stability. The midfoot fusion bolt is a current treatment device that maintains the longitudinal columns of the foot. Also, Achilles<PERSON> tendon lengthening remains a popular method in the management of Charcot<GPE> foot. Cite this article:
