 Crizotinib<GPE>, a small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor, manifests dramatic responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( EML4-ALK ) rearrangements. ALK gene point mutation is the primary mechanism of acquired crizotinib resistance ; however, the intrinsic mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report a patient with a low mutant allele fraction ( MAF<ORGANIZATION> ) of EML4-ALK rearrangement, who experienced primary resistance to crizotinib treatment. The patient was a 66-year-old Chinese<GPE> man, who had a history of metastatic lung cancer and was treated with first- and third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR<ORGANIZATION> TKIs ). After 14 months of osimertinib treatment, his disease progressed, and next-generation sequencing was performed from a liquid biopsy of the patient 's blood. An EML4-ALK rearrangement was found and crizotinib was administered. The patient 's lung lesions continued to progress after one month of crizotinib treatment, and pemetrexed-bevacizumab was initiated. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the metastatic cancers shrunk, and the patient maintained stable disease at his last follow-up. EML4-ALK rearrangements can happen in patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC<ORGANIZATION>, after acquired resistance to EGFR<ORGANIZATION> TKI treatment. The EGFR T790M<ORGANIZATION> and C797G<GPE> mutations occur in cis is a critical mechanism of resistance to osimertinib therapy. The MAF<ORGANIZATION> of EML4-ALK rearrangements in cancer cells might be a predictive factor for crizotinib treatment.
