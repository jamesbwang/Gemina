 Haematopoietic<GPE> stem cell ( HSC<ORGANIZATION> ) transplantation is a critical therapy for haematopoietic malignancies and immune disorders. Incomplete<PERSON> or delayed engraftment of HSCs<ORGANIZATION> in the host results in increased risk of infection and morbidity. The mechanisms of HSC<ORGANIZATION> engraftment are poorly understood and understanding these processes will increase transplantation success on many levels. Current animal models are immunocompromised 'humanised ' mice transplanted with human HSCs<ORGANIZATION>. Harmful<PERSON> procedures include genetic manipulations and irradiation to ablate the mouse immune system, and opaque mouse tissues make visualisation of the early steps of HSC<ORGANIZATION> engraftment impossible. There is a need for new models to offer alternatives to humanised mice in the study of HSC<ORGANIZATION> transplantation. Here we described a detailed method for transplantation of human HSCs<ORGANIZATION> into zebrafish, before the onset of adaptive immunity. Human HSCs<PERSON> were purified from whole blood by enrichment of the CD34<ORGANIZATION> cell population using a positive magnetic selection and further purified using an anti-CD34 antibody and cell sorting. Sorted CD34<ORGANIZATION> cells were transplanted into the blood stream of 52 hour old zebrafish larvae. Human<PERSON> HSCs<ORGANIZATION> home into the zebrafish haematopoietic niche, where they engage with endothelial cells and undergo cell division. Our model offers the opportunities to image
