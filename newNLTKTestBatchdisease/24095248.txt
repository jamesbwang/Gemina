 Lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 ( OLR1<ORGANIZATION> ) locates within the area of chromosome 12p, which has been identified as the AD-susceptible region, and plays a role in lipid metabolism. Therefore, it has been suggested to be a good candidate gene for Alzheimer<ORGANIZATION> 's disease ( AD ). Several SNPs<ORGANIZATION> within OLR1<ORGANIZATION> have been reported to have association with AD<ORGANIZATION> among Caucasians. We selected and genotyped three SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ( rs1050283, rs1050286, rs17808009 ) in OLR1<GPE> to investigate its possible relationship with the onset of late-onset Alzheimer disease ( LOAD<ORGANIZATION> ) in 984 LOAD cases and 1,354 healthy controls among northern Han Chinese<PERSON>. No significant association was found between the OLR1<ORGANIZATION> ( rs1050283, rs1050286, rs17808009 ) polymorphisms and LOAD<ORGANIZATION>, even after adjustment for gender and age and stratification for apolipoprotein E ( APOE<ORGANIZATION> ) status. Our study showed that the SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ( rs1050283, rs1050286, rs17808009 ) located in the 3'UTR of OLR1<ORGANIZATION> may not involve in the mechanism of LOAD<ORGANIZATION> in Han Chinese<PERSON> population.
