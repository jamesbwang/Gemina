 To report a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada ( VKH<ORGANIZATION> ) disease associated with hepatitis B vaccination. Case report. A 43-year-old Caucasian<GPE> male presented with a three-week history of blurry vision, pain, photophobia, and redness in both eyes. Three days prior to the onset of symptoms, he had received the hepatitis B virus vaccine. Clinical<PERSON> evaluation revealed multifocal placoid lesions in the posterior pole, choroidal thickening, and serous macular detachment. Targeted laboratory investigations were negative for infectious or autoimmune markers. After treatment with oral corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of symptoms with near-total recovery of visual function. The patient later reported systemic findings of hearing loss, tinnitus, and integumentary changes. A diagnosis of VKH<ORGANIZATION> disease was made and inflammation was managed with oral corticosteroids followed by methotrexate for long-term disease control. VKH<ORGANIZATION> disease is an inflammatory condition primarily affecting the choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and outer retina. The underlying etiology is unclear, but it can be associated with a viral prodrome suggesting an infectious trigger in a genetically susceptible individual. Our case suggests that hepatitis B vaccination may trigger a similar inflammatory response.
