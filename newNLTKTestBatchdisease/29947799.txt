 Optimal dosing for nebulized gentamicin is unknown. We compared the pulmonary and systemic pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of gentamicin following intravenous and nebulized administration in mechanically ventilated patients. Twelve<PERSON> critically ill male patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia received a 30 min intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg gentamicin, followed 48 h afterwards by the same dose nebulized. Blood samples were collected immediately before and until 24 h after intravenous and nebulized administration ; mini-bronchoalveolar lavages ( mini-BALs ) were performed at 3 and 7 h or 5 and 10 h ( six patients each ) after each intravenous and nebulized administration. The PK<ORGANIZATION> analysis was conducted using a population approach. After intravenous administration, concentrations of gentamicin measured in epithelial lining fluid ( ELF<ORGANIZATION> ) were very variable, and overall in the same range of magnitude ( from 0.3 to 28 mg/L ) as in plasma. After nebulization, gentamicin concentrations were much higher ( âˆ¼3800-fold ) in ELF<ORGANIZATION> than in plasma. The average systemic bioavailability of nebulized gentamicin was estimated to be 5 %, with considerable inter-individual variability. Compared with intravenous administration, after nebulization the exposure ( expressed as AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) to gentamicin was 276-fold greater in ELF<ORGANIZATION> and 18-fold lower in plasma. Compared with intravenous administration, nebulization of gentamicin in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia provides higher pulmonary concentrations and lower systemic concentrations but the inter-individual variability is large.
