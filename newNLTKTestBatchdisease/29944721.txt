 Recent success with B cell depletion therapies has revitalized efforts to understand the pathogenic role of B cells in Multiple<GPE> Sclerosis ( MS ). Using the adoptive transfer system of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE<ORGANIZATION> ), a murine model of MS, we have previously shown that mice in which B cells are the only MHCII-expressing antigen presenting cell ( APC<ORGANIZATION> ) are susceptible to EAE<ORGANIZATION>. However, a reproducible delay in the day of onset of disease driven by exclusive B cell antigen presentation suggests that B cells require optimal conditions to function as APCs<ORGANIZATION> in EAE<ORGANIZATION>. In this study, we utilize an in vivo genetic system to conditionally and temporally regulate expression of MHCII<ORGANIZATION> to test the hypothesis that B cell APCs<ORGANIZATION> mediate attenuated and delayed neuroinflammatory T cell responses during EAE<ORGANIZATION>. Remarkably, induction of MHCII<ORGANIZATION> on B cells following the transfer of encephalitogenic CD4<ORGANIZATION> T cells induced a rapid and robust form of EAE<ORGANIZATION>, while no change in the time to disease onset occurred for recipient mice in which MHCII<ORGANIZATION> is induced on a normal complement of APC<ORGANIZATION> subsets. Changes in CD4<ORGANIZATION> T cell activation over time did not account for more rapid onset of EAE<ORGANIZATION> symptoms in this new B cell-mediated EAE<ORGANIZATION> model. Our system represents a novel model to study how the timing of pathogenic cognate interactions between lymphocytes facilitates the development of autoimmune attacks within the CNS<ORGANIZATION>.
