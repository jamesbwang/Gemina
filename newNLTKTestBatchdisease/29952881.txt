 Retrospective review OBJECTIVE.: To determine reimbursement associated with an anterior discectomy and fusion ( ACDF<ORGANIZATION> ) and the demographic factors influencing reimbursement for an ACDF<ORGANIZATION>. ACDF<ORGANIZATION> has been shown to be a cost-effective procedure. However, there has been minimal analysis of factors influencing reimbursement for this procedure. Clinical<PERSON> and financial data were retrospectively reviewed for 176 patients undergoing an ACDF<ORGANIZATION> procedure in 2013 and 2014. Patients were included if they had primary ACDF<ORGANIZATION> and excluded if they were treated for a traumatic cervical spine fracture, infection, failed primary procedure, front/back procedure or total disc replacement procedure. Clinical<PERSON> factors analyzed included number of levels fused, surgical time, length of stay in the hospital, estimated blood loss, implant type, Charleson Comorbidity Index<PERSON> ( CCI<ORGANIZATION> ), and pre-operative diagnosis. Payer<PERSON> type and reimbursement associated with physician and hospital fees were collected for each patient. A multiple linear regression model determined the factors influencing charge and reimbursement data using a backward conditional stepwise methodology. Variables were only included in multi-variate analysis if there was a significant ( p < 0.05 ) impact on either reimbursement within univariate analysis. One hundred and twenty-eight patients met inclusion criteria. The average reimbursement per patient was $ 24,622 ( +/- standard deviation of 14,616 ). The only significant factor influencing reimbursement was payer type ( p < 0.001 ) and length of hospital stay ( p < 0.001 ) and length of hospital stay ( p < 0.001 ) during our UNIVARIATE<ORGANIZATION> ANALYSIS.: These two independent multi-variate determinants of reimbursement only accounted for 18.6 % of reimbursement variability. There is substantial variability in reimbursement for ACDF<ORGANIZATION> procedures. Multivariate analysis indicates that payer type and length of hospital stay significantly influence reimbursement. Our model, however, only explained a small proportion of reimbursement variability indicating that factors outside our analysis may significantly affect hospital reimbursement. 3.
