 Cryoglobulinaemic<GPE> vasculitis ( CV ) is a lymphoproliferative disorder related to hepatitis C virus ( HCV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection ; anti-viral therapy is the first therapeutic option. CV can be incapacitating, compromising the patients ' quality of life ( QoL<ORGANIZATION> ). In a controlled study, interferon-based therapy was associated with a lower virological response in vasculitic patients than in patients without vasculitis. Limited, uncontrolled data on direct-acting anti-virals are available. To evaluate safety, clinical efficacy, virological response and the impact of interferon-free treatment on QoL<ORGANIZATION> in HCV<ORGANIZATION> patients with and without mixed cryoglobulinaemia ( MC ). We prospectively studied HCV<ORGANIZATION> patients with cryoglobulinaemia ( with vasculitis-CV- and without vasculitis-MC- ) and without cryoglobulinaemia ( controls ), treated with direct-acting anti-virals. Hepato-virological parameters, CV<ORGANIZATION> clinical response and impact on QoL<ORGANIZATION> were assessed. One hundred and eighty-two HCV<ORGANIZATION> patients were recruited ( 85 with CV<ORGANIZATION>, 54 with MC<ORGANIZATION> and 43 controls ). A sustained virological response at 12 weeks ( SVR12<ORGANIZATION> ) was achieved in 166 ( 91.2 % ) patients ( 77/85 CV, 48/54 MC, 41/43 controls ). In CV<ORGANIZATION> SVR patients, cryocrit levels progressively decreased and clinical response progressively improved, reaching 96.7 %, 24 weeks after treatment. QoL<ORGANIZATION>, baseline physical and mental component summaries were lower in the CV<ORGANIZATION> group compared to the other groups ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Scores improved in all groups, and significantly in CV patients after SVR<ORGANIZATION>. No significant differences in SVR<ORGANIZATION> rates were recorded between cryoglobulinaemic patients and controls and a high clinical and immunological efficacy was confirmed in CV<GPE>, supporting the role of interferon-free therapy as the first therapeutic option. Interestingly, CV<ORGANIZATION> patients had worse baseline QoL than other HCV-positive groups and interferon-free therapy was effective in significantly increasing QoL<ORGANIZATION>, suggesting the important role of direct-acting anti-viral-based therapy in improving CV<ORGANIZATION> 's individual and social burden.
