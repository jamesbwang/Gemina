 There is growing global interest in Gross<GPE> National Happiness ( GNH<ORGANIZATION> ) as a metric to capture population well-being and economic development. Empirical evidence suggests that health is necessary for achievement of happiness. The growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases ( NCDs<ORGANIZATION> ) threatens to undermine the achievement of GNH<ORGANIZATION>. We analyze synergies between current policy priorities and the institutional mechanism for GNH<ORGANIZATION> and the Global<ORGANIZATION> NCD Action Plan 2013-2020 that has informed Bhutan<GPE> 's approach to NCDs<ORGANIZATION>. We identify strategic policy opportunities to strengthen outcomes for both policy areas. Lessons from Bhutan<GPE> also suggest strategic opportunities to address NCDs<ORGANIZATION> in other countries where happiness is on the national agenda, or where action on NCDs<ORGANIZATION> could be improved through engagement between health and other sectors, especially where ways to promote and measure GNH<ORGANIZATION> ( population well-being ) already exist.
