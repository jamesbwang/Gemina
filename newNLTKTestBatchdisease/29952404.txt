 Around 18 million unsafe abortions occur in low and middle-income countries and are associated with numerous adverse consequences to women 's health. The time taken by women with complications to reach facilities where they can receive appropriate post-abortion care can influence the risk of death and the extent of further complications. All women aged 18+ admitted for abortion complications to public-sector hospitals in three capital cities in the Northeastern Brazil<LOCATION> between August-December 2010 were interviewed ; medical records were extracted ( N = 2,804 ). Nearly all women ( 94 % ) went straight to a health facility, mainly to a hospital ( 76.6 % ) ; the rest had various care-seeking paths, with a quarter visiting 3+ hospitals. Women<PERSON> waited 10 hours on average before deciding to seek care. 29 % reported difficulties in starting to seek care, including facing challenges in organizing childcare, a companion or transport ( 17 % ) and fear/stigma ( 11 % ) ; a few did not initially recognize they needed care ( 0.4 % ). The median time taken to arrive at the ultimate facility was 36 hours. Over a quarter of women reported experiencing difficulties being admitted to a hospital, including long waits ( 15 % ), only being attended after pregnant women ( 8.9 % ) and waiting for a bed ( 7.4 % ). Almost all women ( 90 % ) arrived in good condition, but those with longer delays were more likely to have ( mild or severe ) complications. In Brazil<GPE>, where access to induced abortion is restricted, women face numerous difficulties receiving post-abortion care, which contribute to delay and influence the severity of post-abortion complications.
