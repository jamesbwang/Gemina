 An increased risk of vaccine-preventable infections ( VPIs<ORGANIZATION> ) is seen in people living with HIV<ORGANIZATION> ( PLWH<ORGANIZATION> ), and current vaccine coverage and immunity is variable. Vaccine passports have the potential to improve vaccine coverage. The objective was to assess how successful a vaccine passport was in improving vaccine coverage in PLWH<GPE>. Baseline<PERSON> immunity to VPIs<ORGANIZATION> was established in PLWH<ORGANIZATION> attending a single HIV clinic and vaccinations required were determined based on the BHIVA Vaccination Guidelines<ORGANIZATION> ( 2015 ). The passport was completed and the PLWH<ORGANIZATION> informed about additional vaccines they should obtain from primary care. After 6-9 months the passport was reviewed including confirmation if vaccines were given. PLWH<ORGANIZATION> satisfaction with the system was evaluated by a survey. Seventy-three PLWH<ORGANIZATION> provided sufficient data for analysis. At baseline significant proportions of PLWH<ORGANIZATION> were not immune/unvaccinated to the main VPIs<ORGANIZATION>, especially human papillomavirus, pneumococcus and measles. After the passport was applied immunity improved significantly ( 56 % overall, p < 0.01 ) for most VPIs<ORGANIZATION> ; however, full coverage was not achieved. The system was popular with PLWH<ORGANIZATION>. The passport was successful in increasing vaccination coverage although full or near-full coverage was not achieved. A more successful service would probably be achieved by commissioning English<PERSON> HIV clinics to provide all vaccines.
