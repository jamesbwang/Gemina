 In the past few years has used thetechnique for analyzing deletions of genes, its rearrangements, cross-reactivity or multiplications in human genome affected of genetic diseases. Was<PERSON> proved that, the best techniques in the investigation of malignant lymphocytes are the Flow Cytometry<ORGANIZATION>, Elisa<PERSON>, ICT<ORGANIZATION> and Fluorescence<GPE> in situ hybridization ( FISH<ORGANIZATION> ). Last method, FISH<ORGANIZATION> is used as an alternative to chromosomal banding, a conventional application in molecular medicine and can detect the chromosomal rearrangements and complexes of different genes in malignant diseases, like chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL<ORGANIZATION> ), acute lymphocytic leukemia, ( ALL<ORGANIZATION> ), or multiple myeloma ( MM ). Identification of P53<GPE> gene deletions and mutations in regions of chromosome 17 in hematological malignancies is important because these mutations have an impact on the clinical management of patients.
