 Candidemia<GPE> epidemiology varies significantly by region ; thus, local data are essential for evidence-based decision-making in prophylaxis and treatment. Current management strategies are derived from large randomized controlled trials mostly executed in large high-volume tertiary care centers. Results may not be entirely transferable to smaller hospitals. This study investigates epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment standards in six hospitals in the Cologne<ORGANIZATION> metropolitan area ( number of inhabitants approx. one million ). We assessed adherence to the current guideline of the European Society<ORGANIZATION> for Clinical Microbiology<PERSON> and Infectious Diseases<ORGANIZATION> ( ESCMID<ORGANIZATION> ) and the Infectious Diseases Society<ORGANIZATION> of America<GPE> ( IDSA<ORGANIZATION> ) using the EQUAL Candida Score<ORGANIZATION> of the European Confederation<ORGANIZATION> of Medical Mycology<ORGANIZATION> ( ECMM<ORGANIZATION> ). Data were documented by trained medical students as part of an integrated research and teaching concept at the University<ORGANIZATION> of Cologne<GPE>. Between<PERSON> January 2014 and June 2017, 77 patients had candidemia, corresponding to an incidence of 0.2 cases/1000 admissions. While 55 patients were enrolled, 22 patients were excluded due to incompletely retrievable health records. Fluconazole monotherapy was the preferred first-line treatment in cases with Candida<GPE> albicans infection ( 21/29 ). A central vascular catheter was present in 40 patients and was removed in 17 ( 43 % ) during treatment. Overall mortality at 30 days was 44 %. Patients<PERSON> reached a mean EQUAL Candida Score<ORGANIZATION> of 9.9 ( range 8-14 ), which was well below the maximum score of 22 for perfect guideline adherence. In summary, management of candidemia differed from current European<GPE> recommendations. It remains unclear to what extent enhanced adherence would improve patient outcome. Larger<PERSON> prospective studies need to answer that question.
