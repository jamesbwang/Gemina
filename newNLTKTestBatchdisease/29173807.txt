 Endothelial dysfunction ( ED ) is involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease ( SVD<ORGANIZATION> ), however, it is not clear if specific biomarkers related to ED are associated with radiological progression of SVD<ORGANIZATION>. A single-center, prospective cohort study was conducted among consecutive, adult patients with SVD<ORGANIZATION>. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association of each baseline biomarker ( highest vs lowest tertile ) and the MRI<ORGANIZATION> radiological outcome after 2 years. The mean Z-score for vascular inflammation ( VI ) combined soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 ), soluble platelet selectin ( sP-selectin ), CD40<ORGANIZATION> ligand ( sCD40<ORGANIZATION> L ), platelet factor-4 ( PF-4 ) and homocysteine ; The study group comprised 123 patients ( age, mean±SD: 72.2±8 years, 49 % females ), with lacunar stroke ( n=49 ), vascular dementia ( n=48 ), and vascular parkinsonism ( n=26 ). Moreover, 34.9 % patients experienced radiological progression, 43 % had progression of isolated white matter lesions ( WMLs<ORGANIZATION> ), 23.2 % had new lacunes, and 34.8 % had both WMLs<ORGANIZATION> progression and new lacunes. After adjustment for confounders ( age, sex, blood pressure, MRI<ORGANIZATION> lesions load ), the PF-4 ( OR<ORGANIZATION> ; 95 % CI 5.5 ; 1.5-21 ), sCD40L<ORGANIZATION> ( 4.6 ; 1.1-18.6 ), IL-6 ( 7.4 ; 1.48-37 ), Z-score for VI<ORGANIZATION> ( 4.5 ; 1.1-18.6 ), and, marginally, homocysteine ( 4.1 ; 0.99-17 ) were associated with the risk of any radiological progression ; further, homocysteine ( 2.4 ; 1.4-14 ), Z-score for SI<ORGANIZATION> ( 2.1 ; 1.2-14 ) and, marginally, IL-6 ( 6.0 ; 0.95 -38 ) were related to the development of new lacunes ; PF-4 ( 7.9 ; 1.6-38 ) and, marginally, the Z-score for VI<ORGANIZATION> ( 4.2 ; 0.9-19.5 ) were correlated with the risk of WMLs<ORGANIZATION> progression. Additional adjustment for clinical SVD<ORGANIZATION> manifestations did not significantly alter the results. The data supports the concept that ED<ORGANIZATION> modulates the radiological progression of SVD<ORGANIZATION> and WMLs<ORGANIZATION> and lacunes are associated with different inflammatory markers.
