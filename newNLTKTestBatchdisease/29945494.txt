 The estimated global prevalence of Peripheral<ORGANIZATION> artery disease ( PAD<ORGANIZATION> ) increased by 24 % in span of 10 years ( 2000-2010 ) from 164 to 202 million. Despite scarcity of data on PAD<ORGANIZATION> in sub-Saharan Africa<GPE> ( SSA<ORGANIZATION> ) and the Caribbean<LOCATION>, estimates for PAD<ORGANIZATION> from these regions may be helpful for health-care providers. The Global Burden<ORGANIZATION> of Disease<ORGANIZATION> Study 2015 quantified health loss from hundreds of diseases using systematic reviews and multilevel computer modeling. Estimated rates with 95 % uncertainty intervals ( UI ) for PAD<ORGANIZATION> ( ICD-10 I70.2 ) were examined for SSA<ORGANIZATION> and the Caribbean<LOCATION> and compared to high-income North America<LOCATION> ( HINA<ORGANIZATION> ). Disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs<ORGANIZATION> ) are years of healthy life lost representing total disease burden by combining years of life lost and years lived disabled. In 2015, estimated age-standardized DALYs<ORGANIZATION> per 100,000 due to PAD<ORGANIZATION> for males were as follows: Caribbean<GPE> ( 34, UI: 29-39 ), HINA<GPE> ( 36, UI: 30-42 ), and SSA<ORGANIZATION> ( 20, UI: 14-30 ). In contrast, DALYs<ORGANIZATION> in females were as follows: Caribbean<GPE> ( 25, UI: 20-30 ), HINA<GPE> ( 28, UI: 22-36 ), and SSA<ORGANIZATION> ( 17, UI: 11-26 ). For both sexes combined, the rate in Southern<LOCATION> SSA was 55 ( 46-67 ). This reflects the extremely high rates in South Africa<GPE> ( males 90, UI: 77-107 ; females 63, UI: 53-75 ). Estimated rate of DALYs<ORGANIZATION> per 100,000 was lowest in SSA<ORGANIZATION>. Within SSA<PERSON>, the rate in South<GPE> Africa<PERSON> was highest, exceeding even HINA<ORGANIZATION>. Caribbean rates were intermediate.
