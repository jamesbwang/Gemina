 In patients with psoriatic arthritis ( PsA<ORGANIZATION> ), limited data exist regarding patterns of biologic therapy use. To examine treatment patterns and therapy modifications in U.S.<GPE> patients with PsA<ORGANIZATION> receiving a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor ( TNFi<ORGANIZATION> ) or an anti-interleukin ( IL ) -12/23 inhibitor. Adults with PsA<ORGANIZATION> who newly initiated a biologic therapy ( index biologic ) between January 1, 2013, and January 31, 2015, were included from the Optum Research Database<ORGANIZATION>. Biologic therapies comprised those that were approved by the FDA<ORGANIZATION> for the treatment of PsA<ORGANIZATION> at the time of the study initiation ( adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, or ustekinumab ). Outcomes included adherence, persistence, and discontinuation of the index biologic ; initiation of adjunctive medications ( nonbiologics, including those commonly used for pain and/or inflammation ) ; and dose escalation of the index biologic during the 12-month follow-up period. Of the 1,235 patients included, 52.5 % were female, and mean ( SD ) age was 50.3 ( 12.1 ) years. The mean ( SD ) duration of persistence with a newly initiated index biologic ( etanercept [ 48.1 % ], adalimumab [ 24.0 % ], infliximab [ 10.4 % ], golimumab [ 8.3 % ], ustekinumab [ 7.2 % ], or certolizumab pegol [ 2.0 % ] ) was 246 ( 128 ) days ; 44.5 % of patients persisted with the index biologic for ≥ 12 months. During the 12-month follow-up period, 22.9 % of patients switched to a different biologic, 26.8 % discontinued without switching or restarting, and 5.8 % discontinued and restarted the index biologic. Of the 1,010 patients who persisted with the index biologic for > 90 days, 45.6 % received ≥ 1 adjunctive medication during the period from 90 days after the index date to the end of persistence or 12 months. The most commonly initiated adjunctive medications were corticosteroids ( 22.0 % ), opioids ( 17.1 % ), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( 12.9 % ). Overall, 9.6 % of patients had a dose escalation of the index biologic in the immediate 12-month post-index period. This real-world study of treatment patterns for PsA<ORGANIZATION>, which used a large U.S.<GPE> claims database, demonstrated that the majority of patients with PsA<ORGANIZATION> discontinued their index biologic ( TNFi<ORGANIZATION> or anti-IL-12/23 inhibitor ) before 12 months. Nearly half of patients initiated an adjunctive medication, many of which were pain and conventional anti-inflammatory medications. This study was sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals<PERSON>.
