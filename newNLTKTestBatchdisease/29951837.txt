 Chloroplasts inherited systems and strategies for protein targeting, translocation, and integration from their cyanobacterial ancestor. Unlike cyanobacteria however, chloroplasts in green algae and plants contain two distinct SEC<ORGANIZATION> translocase/integrase systems: the SEC1<ORGANIZATION> system in the thylakoid membrane and the SEC2<ORGANIZATION> system in the inner envelope membrane. This review summarizes the mode of action of SEC<ORGANIZATION> translocases, identification of components of the SEC2<ORGANIZATION> system, evolutionary history of SCY<ORGANIZATION> and SECA<ORGANIZATION> genes, and previous work on the co- and post-translational targeting of lumenal and thylakoid membrane proteins to the SEC1<ORGANIZATION> system. Recent work identifying substrates for the SEC2<ORGANIZATION> system and potential features that may contribute to inner envelope targeting are also discussed.
