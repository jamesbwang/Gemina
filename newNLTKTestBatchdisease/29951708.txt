 Calodium<GPE> hepaticum ( Nematoda<GPE> ; Capillariidae ) is a parasitic nematode of mammals with a cosmopolitan distribution. Adults of this nematode can infect the liver of many mammalian species, including humans, but the main hosts are members of the superfamily Muroidea. Among these, Rattus<GPE> spp. have the highest apparent prevalences reported worldwide. There are only two reports of C. hepaticum infecting Sigmodontinae species ( Muroidea<PERSON>: Cricetidae ). In this survey, we examined the occurrence of C. hepaticum in two assemblages of Sigmodontinae<GPE> rodents from Argentina<GPE> ( Santa Fe<PERSON> and Entre RÃ­os<PERSON> provinces ). The diagnosis was made by morphological features, histopathological exam, and molecular characterization of 18S ribosomal RNA<ORGANIZATION> gene region. Here, we show that C. hepaticum is a common parasite of Sigmodontinae<GPE>. We report the infection in six species ( all new hosts ): Akodon<PERSON> azarae, Calomys<GPE> callidus, Calomys<GPE> venustus, Oligoryzomys<PERSON> flavescens, Oligoryzomys<GPE> nigripes, and Oxymycterus<GPE> rufus. This is the first report of C. hepaticum in Sigmodontinae<GPE> rodents from Argentina<GPE> and the second record in this subfamily for South America<GPE>. It is also the first confirmation of C. hepaticum infection in Sigmodontinae<GPE> by molecular diagnosis. The genetic findings and the prevalences observed, together with the existing information on C. hepaticum, lead us to propose that Rattus<GPE> spp. brought C. hepaticum to the New<ORGANIZATION> World exposing Sigmodontinae rodents, which are frequently infected by this parasite. The high prevalence of infection in A. azarae ( 41.2 % ) suggests that this host may be playing an important role in C. hepaticum dynamics in the New World<ORGANIZATION>.
