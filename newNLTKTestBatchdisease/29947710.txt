 To identify predictors of death in the Intensive Care Unit<ORGANIZATION> and relate eligible patients to preferential palliative care. A prospective cohort study that evaluated patients hospitalized for more than 24 hours, subdivided into G1<GPE> ( patients who died ) and G2<GPE> ( patients who were discharged from hospital ). For identifying the predictors for death outcome, the intensivist physician was asked the `` surprise question '' and clinical-demographic data were collected from the patients. Data were analyzed by descriptive/inferential statistics ( p < 0.05 significance ). 170 patients were evaluated. The negative response to the `` surprise question '' was related to death outcome. A greater possibility of death ( p < 0.05 ) was observed among older and more frail patients with less functionality, chronic cardiac and/or renal insufficiencies or acute non-traumatic neurological insult, with multiorgan failure for more than 5 days, and hospitalized for longer. Predictors of death were related to a subjective evaluation by the physician, the clinical condition of the patient, underlying diseases, the severity of the acute disease and the evolution of the critical illness. It is suggested that patients with two or more predictive criteria receive preferential palliative care.
