 The aim was to review paediatric patients who had a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture or bacterial PCR<ORGANIZATION> test, yet had a normal CSF<ORGANIZATION> white cell count for age. Patients were included if they had a CSF<ORGANIZATION> sample sent for culture ( between 2005 and 2015 ) or bacterial PCR<ORGANIZATION> ( 2010-2015 ), however neurosurgical and neurology patients were excluded. Of the 2,482 patients reviewed, there were 101 patients with laboratory-confirmed bacterial meningitis included, of which 27 were positive by culture and PCR<ORGANIZATION>, 26 by culture alone and 48 were positive by PCR<ORGANIZATION> only. Eighteen ( 18 % ) of these patients had CSF<ORGANIZATION> white cell counts within normal range. Only one case with a normal CSF<ORGANIZATION> white cell count, where the lumbar puncture was done after six days of antibiotics, was deemed to be clinically significant. Bacterial PCR<ORGANIZATION> should not be routinely requested in patients with a normal CSF<ORGANIZATION> white cell count, unless their blood culture is positive or unless clinically indicated based on the assessment of a senior paediatrician.
