 Prospective data regarding the role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD<ORGANIZATION> ) for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with long QT syndrome ( LQTS<ORGANIZATION> ) is scarce. Herein<PERSON>, we explore the prospective Rochester LQTS ICD registry to assess the risk for appropriate shock in primary prevention in a real-world setting. We studied 212 LQTS<ORGANIZATION> patients that had ICD<ORGANIZATION> implantation for primary prevention. Best-subsets proportional-hazards regression analysis was used to identify clinical variables that were associated with the first appropriate shock. Conditional models of Prentice, Williams<PERSON>, and Peterson<PERSON> were utilized for the analysis of recurrent appropriate shocks. During a median follow-up of 9.2 ± 4.9 years, there were 42 patients who experienced at least one appropriate shock and the cumulative probability of appropriate shock at 8 years was 22 %. QTc<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 550 ms [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 3.94, confidence interval ( CI ) 2.08-7.46 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) and prior syncope on β-blockers ( HR 1.92, CI 1.01-3.65 ; P<PERSON> = 0.047 ) were associated with increased risk of appropriate shock. History of syncope while on β-blocker treatment ( HR 1.87, CI 1.28-2.72 ; P<PERSON> = 0.001 ), QTc<ORGANIZATION> 500-549 ms ( HR 1.68, CI 1.10-2.81 ; P<PERSON> = 0.048 ), and QTc<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 550 ms ( HR 3.66, CI 2.34-5.72 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) were associated with increased risk for recurrent appropriate shocks, while β-blockers were not protective ( HR 1.03, CI 0.63-1.68, P<PERSON> = 0.917 ). LQT2 ( HR 2.10, CI 1.22-3.61 ; P<PERSON> = 0.008 ) and multiple mutations ( HR 2.87, CI 1.49-5.53 ; P<PERSON> = 0.002 ) were associated with higher risk for recurrent shocks as compared with LQT1<ORGANIZATION>. In this prospective ICD<ORGANIZATION> registry, we identified clinical and genetic variables that were associated appropriate shock risk. These data can be used for risk stratification in high-risk patients evaluated for primary prevention with ICD<ORGANIZATION>.
