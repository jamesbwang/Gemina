 Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries ( MINOCA<ORGANIZATION> ) is a syndrome with different causes, characterised by clinical evidence of myocardial infarction with normal or near-normal coronary arteries on angiography. Its prevalence ranges between 5 % and 25 % of all myocardial infarction. The prognosis is extremely variable, depending on the cause of MINOCA<ORGANIZATION>. The key principle in the management of this syndrome is to clarify the underlying individual mechanisms to achieve patient-specific treatments. Clinical<PERSON> history, electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, echocardiography, coronary angiography and left ventricular angiography represent the first level diagnostic investigations to identify the causes of MINOCA<ORGANIZATION>. Regional wall motion abnormalities at left ventricular angiography limited to a single epicardial coronary artery territory identify an 'epicardial pattern'whereas regional wall motion abnormalities extended beyond a single epicardial coronary artery territory identify a 'microvascular pattern '. The most common causes of MINOCA<ORGANIZATION> are represented by coronary plaque disease, coronary dissection, coronary artery spasm, coronary microvascular spasm, Takotsubo<GPE> cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, coronary thromboembolism, other forms of type 2 myocardial infarction and MINOCA<ORGANIZATION> of uncertain aetiology. This review aims at summarising the diagnosis and management of MINOCA<ORGANIZATION>, according to the underlying physiopathology.
