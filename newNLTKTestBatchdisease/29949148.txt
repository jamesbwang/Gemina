 To investigate the therapeutic effect of metronomic chemotherapy with low-dose Tegafur on patients with primary hepatic carcinoma ( PHC<ORGANIZATION> ) after radiofrequency ablation ( RFA<ORGANIZATION> ). PHC patients who underwent RFA<ORGANIZATION> were assigned to RFA<ORGANIZATION> + Tegafur group and RFA<ORGANIZATION> group, respectively. Patients in RFA<ORGANIZATION> + Tegafur group received metronomic chemotherapy with low-dose Tegafur after RFA<ORGANIZATION>. PHC<ORGANIZATION> patients in RFA<ORGANIZATION> group only received radiofrequency ablation. Therapeutic efficacy of the two groups was prospectively analyzed within 18 months after RFA<ORGANIZATION>. Disease<PERSON> control rate ( DCR<ORGANIZATION> ) and progression-free survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) in both groups were evaluated. Follow-up data showed that DCR<ORGANIZATION> in RFA<ORGANIZATION> + Tegafur group and RFA<ORGANIZATION> group at 9 months after RFA<ORGANIZATION> was 93.3 % and 73.4 %, respectively ( p=0.038 ). Within the 18-month follow-up, median PFS in RFA<ORGANIZATION> + Tegafur group and RFA<ORGANIZATION> group was 16.25 months and 12.25 months, respectively ( p < 0.001 ). One-year PFS in RFA<ORGANIZATION> group was 53.3 %, which was remarkably lower than that of RFA<ORGANIZATION> + Tegafur group ( 83.3 %, p=0.012 ). Moreover, the prevalence of major complications in the present study was 13.3 %. No treatment-related death occurred in both groups. Metronomic<ORGANIZATION> chemotherapy with low-dose Tegafur after RFA<ORGANIZATION> can slow down tumor progression and prolong the progression-free survival of PHC<ORGANIZATION> patients.
