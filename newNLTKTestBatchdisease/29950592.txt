 Invasive<GPE> squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC<ORGANIZATION> ) of the penis is almost always treated with surgical therapy at the primary site. However, almost all other SCC<ORGANIZATION> primary sites, such as anal, vulvar, uterine cervix, head and neck, and oesophagus, and their involved nodal basins, can be successfully treated with radiotherapy or combined chemotherapy and radiation, reserving surgery as a salvage option. Review of the penile cancer literature and examination of data from more common SCC<ORGANIZATION> primary sites make a case for complete organ preservation of the penis using definitive combined chemotherapy and radiation, reserving surgical therapies as salvage options.
