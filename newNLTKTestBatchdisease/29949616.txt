 Adverse<GPE> drug events ( ADEs<ORGANIZATION> ) are the fifth leading cause of death and thus responsible for a large number of hospital admissions in all over the globe. This study was aimed to assess the antibiotics associated preventability of ADEs<ORGANIZATION> and causality of adverse drug reactions ( ADRs<ORGANIZATION> ) among hospitalized patients. A prospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted in four tertiary care public sector hospitals of Lahore<GPE>, Pakistan<GPE>. Study<PERSON> population consisted of hospitalized patients who were prescribed with one or more antibiotics. Data were collected between 1st January, 2017 and 31st June, 2017 from 1,249 patients ( 384 patients aged â‰¤ 18 years and 865 patients aged > 18 years ). Schumock<PERSON> and Thornton<GPE> scale was used to assess the preventability of the ADEs<ORGANIZATION>. Medication errors ( MEs<ORGANIZATION> ) that caused preventable ADEs<ORGANIZATION> were assessed by MEs<ORGANIZATION> tracking form while Naranjo<PERSON> score was used to evaluate the causal relation of ADRs<ORGANIZATION> with the antibiotics. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences<ORGANIZATION> ( IBM<ORGANIZATION> SPSS Statistics<ORGANIZATION> for Windows<GPE>, Version 21.0. Armonk<PERSON>, NY: IBM<ORGANIZATION> Corp. ) and Microsoft Excel<ORGANIZATION> ( MS Office, 2010 ) were used for data analysis. 2,686 antibiotics were prescribed to 1,249 patients. Among them, fluoroquinolones ( 11.8 % ), macrolides ( 11.6 % ) and cephalosporins ( 10.9 % ) were the most frequently prescribed antibiotics. The most affected organ system by antibiotics associated ADEs<ORGANIZATION> was gastrointestinal tract. A total of 486 ADEs were found. The preventability assessment revealed that most of the ADEs<ORGANIZATION> ( 58.4 % ) were preventable ( 43.6 % of the ADEs<ORGANIZATION> were definitely preventable while 14.8 % were probably preventable ) and caused by MEs<ORGANIZATION> including wrong drug ( 40.1 % ) and monitoring errors ( 25.0 % ), during the stage of physician ordering ( 22.2 % ) and patient monitoring ( 21.1 % ). The errors were caused due to non-adherence of policies ( 38.4 % ) and lack of information about antibiotics ( 32 % ). Most of the non-preventable ADEs<ORGANIZATION> or ADRs<ORGANIZATION> among adults and children were `` probable '' ( 35.5 % ) and `` possible '' ( 35.8 % ), respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that ADEs<ORGANIZATION> were significantly less among females ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.047, 95 % CI = 0.018-0.121, p-value = < 0.001 ), patients aged 18-52 years ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.041, 95 % CI = 0.013-0.130, p-value = < 0.001 ), tuberculosis patients ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.304, 95 % CI = 0.186-0.497, p-value = < 0.001 ), patients with acute respiratory tract infections ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.004, 95 % CI = 0.01-0.019, p-value = < 0.001 ) and among the patients prescribed with 2 antibiotics per prescription ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.455, 95 % CI = 0.319-0.650, p-value = < 0.001 ). According to preventability assessment most of the ADEs<ORGANIZATION> were definitely preventable and caused by MEs<ORGANIZATION> due to non-adherence of policies and lack of information about antibiotics. The causality assessment of non-preventable ADEs<ORGANIZATION> showed that most of the ADRs<ORGANIZATION> were probable and possible.
