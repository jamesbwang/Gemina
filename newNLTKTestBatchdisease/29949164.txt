 Cerebral ischemia is a common neurological disease, and its pathological process remains elusive. This study focused on the protective mechanism of Apelin-12 protein on the nervous system of mice during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through JNK<ORGANIZATION> and P38MAPK<ORGANIZATION> signaling pathway. The mouse model with an ischemia-reperfusion injury in middle cerebral artery was prepared by the modified thread-occlusion method and divided into 4 groups randomly. Before implantation of the mice, we assessed the neurological function and evaluated the cerebral edema by the wet-dry weight method. Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH<ORGANIZATION> ) kit was used to assess the degree of cell injury. Malondialdehyde<GPE> ( MDA<ORGANIZATION> ) kit was used to measure the level of neuron MDA<ORGANIZATION>. Immunohistochemistry<PERSON> was performed to evaluate the neuronal cell in the ischemic brain. Protein expressions of JNK<ORGANIZATION> and P38MAPK<ORGANIZATION> and apoptosis-related molecules, including Bax<PERSON>, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-3, were measured by Western<GPE> blot assay. After focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, a significant decrease in neurobehavioral score, brain edema and neuron injury in mice occurred. Apelin-12 significantly improved the neurobehavioral score of the mice with ischemia-reperfusion injury, alleviated brain edema and the damage to neurons. In addition, Apelin-12 inhibited the morphological changes and apoptosis of neuronal cells in the ischemic penumbra of mice. Apelin-12 could downregulate the expression of Bax<ORGANIZATION> and caspase-3, inhibit the activity of caspase-3 and upregulate the expression of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein. A significant reduction in the protein expression of p-JNK and p-p38 was observed in the Apelin-12 group compared with that in the I/R or Vehicle<ORGANIZATION> group ( p < 0.05 ). When an ischemia-reperfusion injury occurred, Apelin-12 can inhibit the JNK<ORGANIZATION> and P38MAPK<ORGANIZATION> signaling pathway of the apoptosis-related MAPKs<ORGANIZATION> family, thus offering protection to neurons.
