 CXCL13<GPE>, a chemokine for B cells, follicular T cells, T helper 17 cells, and regulatory T cells, is reported to contribute to the development of systemic sclerosis ( SSc<ORGANIZATION> ), reflecting aberrant activation of immune system. To better understand the role of CXCL13<ORGANIZATION> in SSc<ORGANIZATION>, we investigated the influence of Fli1<GPE> deficiency, a potential predisposing factor of this disease, on CXCL13<ORGANIZATION> expression and assessed clinical correlation of serum CXCL13<ORGANIZATION> levels by multivariate regression analysis. Haploinsufficient loss of Fli1<GPE> remarkably induced CXCL13<ORGANIZATION> expression in murine peritoneal macrophages, while gene silencing of FLI1<ORGANIZATION> did not affect the expression of CXCL13<ORGANIZATION> in human dermal fibroblasts and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Serum CXCL13<PERSON> levels were elevated in SSc<ORGANIZATION> patients compared with healthy controls and correlated positively with skin score and negatively with pulmonary function test results. SSc patients with elevated serum CXCL13<ORGANIZATION> levels had longer disease duration, diffuse cutaneous involvement, interstitial lung disease ( ILD<ORGANIZATION> ), heart involvement, pulmonary arterial hypertension, Raynaud<PERSON> 's phenomenon, pitting scars, digital ulcers, telangiectasia, and high serum IgG<ORGANIZATION> levels more frequently than the other patients. Especially, serum CXCL13<ORGANIZATION> levels were associated with ILD<ORGANIZATION> and digital ulcers by multivariate regression analysis. Taken together, these results indicate that CXCL13<ORGANIZATION> expression is up-regulated by Fli1<PERSON> deficiency in macrophages, potentially contributing to the development of tissue fibrosis, vasculopathy, and immune activation in SSc<ORGANIZATION>, especially ILD<ORGANIZATION> and digital ulcers.
