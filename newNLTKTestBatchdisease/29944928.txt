 Clostridium<GPE> difficile is an important cause of nosocomial diarrhea in the western world. Toxins<GPE> ( A, B<GPE>, and binary toxins ) generated by C. difficile bacteria damage intestinal epithelial cells. Hallmarks of host response to C. difficile infection ( CDI<ORGANIZATION> ) include upregulation of inflammatory mediators and tissue infiltration by immune cells. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF<ORGANIZATION> ) is an inflammatory cytokine that is known to enhance the host immune response to infectious pathogens. Additionally, MIF<ORGANIZATION> can adversely impact host survival to numerous infections. The role of MIF<ORGANIZATION> in the pathogenesis of CDI<ORGANIZATION> remains poorly understood. Here, we show that patients with CDI<ORGANIZATION> had significantly higher circulating MIF<ORGANIZATION> compared to patients who had diarrhea but tested negative for C. difficile ( non-CDI controls ). Similarly, in a mouse model, C. difficile challenge significantly increased levels of plasma and tissue MIF<ORGANIZATION>. Antibody-mediated depletion of MIF<ORGANIZATION> decreased C. difficile-induced inflammatory responses, clinical disease, and mortality. Together, these results uncover a potential role for MIF<ORGANIZATION> in exacerbating CDI<ORGANIZATION> and suggest that use of anti-MIF antibodies may represent a therapeutic strategy to curb host inflammatory responses and improve disease outcomes in CDI<ORGANIZATION>.
