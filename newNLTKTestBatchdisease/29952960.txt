 IgG4-related disease ( IgG4-RD ) is an emerging immune-mediated disease characterized by multi-organ involvement and variable clinical behavior. We describe the case of a 50-year-old woman affected by a rare variant of IgG4-RD, characterized by eyelid xanthelasmas, adult-onset asthma and salivary and lacrimal glands enlargement. Multiple lymphadenopathies and a pulmonary mass were present at initial evaluation. After a single course of rituximab ( 2g in 2 refracted doses ), an almost complete clinical remission was achieved without chronic steroid administration. Magnetic<PERSON> resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ), high-resolution computed tomography ( HRCT<ORGANIZATION> ) of the thorax, and positron emission tomography ( 18FDG-PET-CT ) confirmed good response to treatment. Circulating plasmablasts dropped to undetectable levels as well. Xanthelasmas only remained unchanged. Remission<PERSON> persisted at 1-year follow-up. Steroid<PERSON> therapy is still considered standard first-line therapy in IgG4-RD. However, high doses are generally required and relapses are common during the tapering phase. Rituximab<PERSON> is a well described steroid-sparing strategy, so far reserved to refractory cases only. In our experience, rituximab has been used as first-line monotherapy, showing great and sustained efficacy and optimal tolerability. The peculiar variant of IgG4-RD affecting our patient, the relatively low baseline plasmablast concentration, and the early placement of rituximab therapy may have facilitated the good response.
