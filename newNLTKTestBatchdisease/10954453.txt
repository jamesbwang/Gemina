 Imaging<GPE> plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ) as well as in determining treatment efficacy, or complications, following therapy. Unlike other cancers, HCC<ORGANIZATION> is most commonly treated by locoregional therapies ( LRTs<ORGANIZATION> ) such as thermal ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, and transarterial radioembolization. These treatments can lead to changes on imaging that make determination of residual/recurrent disease difficult. This literature-based review discusses the expected postimaging findings following LRT<ORGANIZATION>.
