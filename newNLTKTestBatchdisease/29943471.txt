 This study aimed to investigate the miR-126 expression in lesional skin and its correlation with clinical features in psoriasis patients and to explore the effect of upregulated miR-126 on cells ' proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation in human keratinocytes. A total of 102 psoriasis patients were consecutively enrolled in this study. MiR-126 expressions in lesional skin and paired nonlesional skin were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR<ORGANIZATION> ). Human keratinocytes ( HaCaT<ORGANIZATION> cells ) were transfected with miR-126 mimic plasmids and blank mimic plasmid. Cell Counting<PERSON> Kit-8 and annexin V/propidium iodide assays were performed to assess the cells ' proliferation and apoptosis, and protein levels of apoptotic markers ( cleaved caspase-3 [ C-caspase-3 ] and B-cell lymphoma-2 [ Bcl-2 ] ) were detected by Western<GPE> blot assay. Inflammatory cytokines mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein levels were detected by qPCR<ORGANIZATION> and Western<GPE> blot assays, respectively. MiR-126 expression was upregulated in lesional skin tissue compared with paired nonlesional skin tissue, and its expression positively associated with Psoriasis Area<PERSON> and Severity Index<ORGANIZATION> score in psoriasis patients. MiR-126 expression was increased in miR-126 mimic group compared with negative control ( NC ) mimic group after plasmids transfection into HaCaT<ORGANIZATION> cells, and cells ' proliferation was enhanced while cells ' apoptosis rate was reduced in miR-126 mimic group than NC mimic group. Protein expressions of C-caspase and Bcl-2 also indicated miR-126 mimic decreased the cells ' apoptosis. In addition, miR-126 mimic increased TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-22 expressions while decreased IL-10 expression. In conclusion, miR-126 correlates with elevated risk and increased disease severity in psoriasis patients, and upregulation of miR-126 promotes cells ' proliferation and inflammation while inhibits cells ' apoptosis in keratinocytes.
