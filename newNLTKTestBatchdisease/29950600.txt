 The Ebola<ORGANIZATION> filovirus causes severe hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate in humans. The primary structural matrix protein VP40<ORGANIZATION> displays transformer-protein characteristics and exists in different conformational and oligomeric states. VP40<ORGANIZATION> plays crucial roles in viral assembly and budding at the plasma membrane of the infected cells and is capable of forming virus-like particles without the need for other Ebola proteins. However, no experimental three-dimensional structure for any filovirus VP40<ORGANIZATION> cylindrical assembly matrix is currently available. Here, we use a protein-protein docking approach to develop cylindrical assembly models for an Ebola virion and also for a smaller structural matrix that does not contain genetic material. These models match well with the 2D averages of cryo-electron tomograms of the authentic virion. We also used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the stability and dynamics of the cylindrical models and the interactions between the side-by-side hexamers to determine the amino acid residues that are especially important for stabilizing the hexamers in the cylindrical ring configuration matrix assembly. Our models provide helpful information to better understand the assembly processes of filoviruses and such structural studies may also lead to the design and development of antiviral drugs.
