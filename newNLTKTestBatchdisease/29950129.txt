 evaluate the difference between chromosomal abnormalities between the gender of couples affected by Recurrent<ORGANIZATION> miscarriage ( RM ) and if there is an association between previous obstetric history and chromosomal abnormalities of the parents. Multicenter, retrospective, observational study from seven different RM clinics between 2006 and 2016. We enrolled 707 couples ( 1014 participants ) with a history of RM<ORGANIZATION>. We compared the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities between groups of couples with primary and secondary RM and separated between women and their partners. Furthermore, we compared the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities between groups based on the number of previous spontaneous abortions. The overall prevalence of all cytogenetic abnormalities was 5.59 % ( n = 1414, women and their partners ). Excluding cases of polymorphism and inversion of chromosome 9, which are considered variants of normality, the prevalence in all individuals was 2.26 % ( n = 32/1414 ). The comparative analysis of cases of chromosomal abnormalities among couples with primary and secondary RM based on the number of previous miscarriages ( PM ) revealed a similar frequency between groups. The statistical analysis of the total cases ( primary PM + secondary PM ) in these three groups were as follows: ( a ) couple, 2 pm versus 3 pm vs. ≥ 4 PM, p = 0.514 ; ( b ) women, 2 pm versus 3 pm vs. ≥ 4 PM, p = 0.347 ; and ( 3 ) partner, 2 pm versus 3 pm vs. ≥ 4 PM, p = 0.959. Chromosomal abnormalities were significantly more prevalent among women than among their partners ( 6.9 versus 4.2 % ; p = 0.027 ). Moreover, the distribution of leading chromosomal abnormalities among women was different compared with their partners. Among women, we observed these abnormalities in the following frequency order: mosaicism ( 38.8 % ), polymorphism ( 32.6 % ), translocation ( 16.3 % ), and inversion ( 12.3 % ). Among their partners, these abnormalities were polymorphism ( 73.3 % ), inversion ( 13.3 % ), mosaicism ( 6.7 % ), and translocation ( 6.7 % ). The number of PM<ORGANIZATION> and the history of full term pregnancy does not correlate with an increase or decrease in the prevalence of cytogenetic abnormalities in couples with RM<ORGANIZATION>.
