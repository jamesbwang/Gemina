 Endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) induces pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary fibrosis. Given that endothelial cells are the main source of ET-1 and ET-1 from other cells may encounter difficulty penetrating vascular compartments, we hypothesize that endothelial-derived ET-1 promotes vascular remodeling secondary to pulmonary fibrosis. We used vascular endothelial ET-1 knock-out ( VEETKO<ORGANIZATION> ) and Wild<PERSON> type mice for this research. They were given intratracheal bleomycin and euthanized at day 28. We quantified pulmonary fibrosis, measured lung ET-1 and its receptors ' expression, and assessed pulmonary vascular remodeling by calculating medial wall index, muscularization index, adventitial collagen and adventitial fibroblast and macrophage accumulation. Right ventricle remodeling was also assessed. Both VEETKO<ORGANIZATION> and Wild<PERSON> type mice developed comparable pulmonary fibrosis and similar fibrosis-related gene expression. Compared to Wild<GPE> type mice, bleomycin-induced VEETKO<ORGANIZATION> mice had lower ET-1 peptide levels ( 15.4 pg/mg vs. 31.2 pg/mg, p < 0.01 ). Expression of both ET-1 receptors mRNAs were increased in fibrosis models. Bleomycin-induced fibrosis VEETKO<ORGANIZATION> mice had significantly less muscularized arterioles, lower muscularization index and attenuated adventitial collagen, fibroblast and macrophage accumulation as compared to that of Wild<GPE> type mice. Right ventricular pressure, hypertrophy and fibrosis did not increase both in VEETKO<ORGANIZATION> and Wild<PERSON> type mice despite the more enhanced vascular remodeling in Wild<GPE> type. In conclusion, endothelial-derived endothelin-1 promotes pulmonary vascular remodeling secondary to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
