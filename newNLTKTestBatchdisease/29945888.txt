 Small<GPE> cell lung cancer ( SCLC<ORGANIZATION> ) is widely considered to be a tumor of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells ; however, a variant form of this disease has been described that lacks neuroendocrine features. Here, we applied domain-focused CRISPR<ORGANIZATION> screening to human cancer cell lines to identify the transcription factor ( TF ) POU2F3<ORGANIZATION> ( POU<ORGANIZATION> class 2 homeobox 3 ; also known as SKN-1a/OCT-11 ) as a powerful dependency in a subset of SCLC<ORGANIZATION> lines. An analysis of human SCLC<ORGANIZATION> specimens revealed that POU2F3<ORGANIZATION> is expressed exclusively in variant SCLC<ORGANIZATION> tumors that lack expression of neuroendocrine markers and instead express markers of a chemosensory lineage known as tuft cells. Using chromatin- and RNA-profiling experiments, we provide evidence that POU2F3<ORGANIZATION> is a master regulator of tuft cell identity in a variant form of SCLC<ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, we show that most SCLC<ORGANIZATION> tumors can be classified into one of three lineages based on the expression of POU2F3<ORGANIZATION>, ASCL1<ORGANIZATION>, or NEUROD1<ORGANIZATION>. Our CRISPR<ORGANIZATION> screens exposed other unique dependencies in POU2F3-expressing SCLC lines, including the lineage TFs<ORGANIZATION> SOX9 and ASCL2<ORGANIZATION> and the receptor tyrosine kinase IGF1R<ORGANIZATION> ( insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ). These data reveal POU2F3<ORGANIZATION> as a cell identity determinant and a dependency in a tuft cell-like variant of SCLC<ORGANIZATION>, which may reflect a previously unrecognized cell of origin or a
