 Long noncoding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) are lengthy noncoding transcripts which are involved in critical signaling pathways including cell cycle and apoptosis so it is not surprising to see their altered expression in human tumors. Colorectal<ORGANIZATION> adenocarcinoma is one the most frequent malignancies worldwide. The role of lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in colorectal adenocarcinoma is not well understood. To study the significance of lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in colorectal adenocarcinoma, we retrieved 189 approved lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> from HGNC<ORGANIZATION>. The genes were imported into the cBioPortal<ORGANIZATION> database for transcriptomic analyses. We queried all the samples from TCGA<ORGANIZATION> provisional colorectal adenocarcinoma with RNA-seq v2 data in our study and considered RNA<ORGANIZATION> dysregulation with Z-score: Â±2. The lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> which was altered in most of the patients were considered as `` significant lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> '' for further analyses. We considered the association of candidate lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> with clinicopathologic parameters of samples including tumor disease anatomic site, neoplasm histologic types, tumor stage and survival. We also compute the specificity of the significant lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> expression in colorectal adenocarcinoma comparing with other human cancers in cancer portal. Our analysis showed that lncRNAs SNHG6<ORGANIZATION>, PVT1<ORGANIZATION> and ZFAS1<ORGANIZATION> allocated the maximum alteration among the colorectal cases. The expression of SNHG6<ORGANIZATION> and ZFAS1<ORGANIZATION> was more in rectal adenocarcinoma than the colon carcinoma while the PVT1<ORGANIZATION> showed the same expression levels in both tissues. However, we found that upregulation of PVT1<ORGANIZATION> has been reduced the overall survival in patients. Altogether these data showed SNHG6<ORGANIZATION>, PVT1<ORGANIZATION> and ZFAS1<ORGANIZATION>, are promising candidates for experimental research on colorectal adenocarcinoma to discover novel biomarker for this prevalent cancer.
