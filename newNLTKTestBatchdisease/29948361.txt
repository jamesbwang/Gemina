 The purpose of the research is to characterize Staphylococcus<PERSON> aureus colonization in healthy population of Algiers<GPE>, to assess the impact on diagnostic performance of systematic additional broth enrichment, and to ascertain the additional benefits of multiple site screening. In order to more accurately determine the prevalence of S. aureus colonization, the swab specimens from multiple screening sites were incubated in brain-heart broth before agar plating. From 2009 to 2011, 1176 samples were collected from 459 participants ( 201 adults and 258 children ). The additional enrichment detection step significantly increased S. aureus detection rates ( p < 0.0001 ). S. aureus nasal detection was positive in 37.8 % of adults, and the addition of throat samplings significantly increased the S. aureus detection rate up to 54.7 % ( p < 0.001 ). S. aureus nasal detection was positive in 37.6 % of children. The addition of throat samplings in children significantly increased the S. aureus detection rate up to 53.1 % ( p < 0.001 ) and that of anal samplings up to 59.7 %. The overall prevalence of methicillin-resistant<ORGANIZATION> S. aureus was 5.2 % ( 3 % of adults and 7 % of children ). spa typing of all isolates revealed a diverse but strongly clonal S. aureus population structure. This approach involving multiple anatomical sampling sites and an additional enrichment of the swabs before conventional culture significantly increases the detection rate of S. aureus carriers and may prove valuable to improve global S. aureus infection prevention.
