 Three species of Microsporidia<GPE> were identified from a population of the beet webworm Loxostege<PERSON> sticticalis at prevalence rates of 35, 4, and 3 %. The most prevalent parasite ( Tubulinosema sp. ) was similar to Tubulinosema<GPE> acridophagus ( 99.8 % ssrDNA<ORGANIZATION> sequence similarity ) and was also isolated from the parasitoid Lydella<PERSON> thompsoni ( Diptera<ORGANIZATION>, Tachinidae<GPE> ) that emerged from the beet webworms. In laboratory assays, spores of this Tubulinosema sp. showed an infection rate of up to 80 % for both L. sticticalis and Galleria<GPE> mellonella larvae. The spores were viable after 12 months of storage in dried infected cadavers. The second most prevalent parasite was closely related to Nosema<GPE> furnacalis and Nosema<GPE> granulosis ( 98.7 % similarity ). Fresh spores showed a 50 % infection rate under laboratory conditions. The third most abundant parasite was identified as the honeybee pathogen Nosema<PERSON> ceranae ( 100 % ssrDNA<ORGANIZATION> and 95-100 % IGS<ORGANIZATION> similarity ). In the laboratory, fresh spores of N. ceranae isolated from beet webworm and honey bee were infective to L. sticticalis larvae at the rates of 5 and 2 %, respectively.
