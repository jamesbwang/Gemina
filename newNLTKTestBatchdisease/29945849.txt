 To analyze the impact of the International Nosocomial<ORGANIZATION> Infection Control Consortium ( INICC<ORGANIZATION> ) Multidimensional Approach ( IMA<ORGANIZATION> ) and use of INICC Surveillance Online System<ORGANIZATION> ( ISOS<ORGANIZATION> ) on ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP<ORGANIZATION> ) rates in Saudi Arabia<GPE> from September 2013 to February 2017. A multicenter, prospective, before-after surveillance study on 14,961 patients in 37 intensive care units ( ICUs<ORGANIZATION> ) of 22 hospitals. During baseline, we performed outcome surveillance of VAP<ORGANIZATION> applying the definitions of the CDC/NHSN. During intervention, we implemented the IMA<ORGANIZATION> and the ISOS<ORGANIZATION>, which included: ( 1 ) a bundle of infection prevention practice interventions, ( 2 ) education, ( 3 ) outcome surveillance, ( 4 ) process surveillance, ( 5 ) feedback on VAP<ORGANIZATION> rates and consequences and ( 6 ) performance feedback of process surveillance. Bivariate<ORGANIZATION> and multivariate regression analyses were performed using generalized linear mixed models to estimate the effect of intervention. The baseline rate of 7.84 VAPs per 1000 mechanical-ventilator ( MV ) -days-with 20,927 MV-days and 164 VAPs-, was reduced to 4.74 VAPs per 1000 MV-days-with 118,929 MV-days and 771 VAPs-, accounting for a 39 % rate reduction ( IDR<ORGANIZATION> 0.61 ; 95 % CI 0.5-0.7 ; P 0.001 ). Implementing the IMA<ORGANIZATION> was associated with significant reductions in VAP<ORGANIZATION> rates in ICUs<ORGANIZATION> of Saudi Arabia<GPE>.
