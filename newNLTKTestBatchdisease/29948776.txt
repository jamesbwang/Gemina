 A cross-sectional study was carried out between November 2015 and January 2016 to determine the seroprevalence of Brucella<GPE> antibodies in cattle raised under communal, fenced farms and tethering systems and the associated factors. Seven hundred twenty-eight bovine sera were collected and tested with rose Bengal<GPE> test as a screening test and the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as a confirmatory test. Animal- and herd-level data were collected and binary logistic regression was used to assess the potential risk factors. True animal- and herd-level prevalence was highest in the fenced farms ( 4.5 % ( 95 % CI, 2.3-6.9 ) and 19.5 % ( 95 % CI, 8.2-32.7 ) respectively ). The risks for natural brucellosis infection were sharing water with wild animals ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.21, 95 % CI, 0.104-0.83 ), herd size ( medium: OR = 0.089, 95 % CI 0.017-0.449 ; large: OR = 0.024, 95 % CI 0.003-0.203 ), fenced farms ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 3.7, 95 % CI, 1.7-7.9 ), sex ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.03, 95 % CI, 0.01-0.079 ), and lactation ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.013, 95 % CI, 0.004-0.049 ). Changes in rangeland tenure and the shift towards intensive cattle production have influenced brucellosis epidemiology. Future studies should aim at identifying the infecting Brucellae<PERSON> and examining the role of wildlife in brucellosis epidemiology.
