 The rare morphological variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL<ORGANIZATION> ) may pose a challenge in diagnosis, especially when presentation primarily involves skin lesions. Here we describe a rare case of small cell variant of ALCL<ORGANIZATION> in an 11-year-old girl. We performed clinical, morphological, and immunohistochemical analyses of developed cutaneous nodules. Pathologists should consider this small cell variant in ALCL<ORGANIZATION> differential diagnosis, as early and correct diagnosis has important clinical implications. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation appears to be a promising treatment option for small cell variant of ALCL<ORGANIZATION>. Histological diagnosis of small cell variant of ALCL<ORGANIZATION> is challenging among pediatricians because of its low incidence and atypical presentation. We provide a short review of the small cell variant of ALCL<ORGANIZATION> to facilitate the diagnosis of this difficult-to-recognize entity.
