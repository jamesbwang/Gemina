 In epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, epithelial cells lose their features, acquiring a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Nm23-H1 protein relates to tumor cells ' metastatic potential, its low expression in carcinomas often meaning a poor prognosis. This study newly investigated the role of nuclear nm23-H1 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Immunohistochemical analyses of nuclear nm23-H1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail<PERSON>, Zinc<PERSON> finger E-box binding homeobox ( ZEB<ORGANIZATION> ) 1, and ZEB2<ORGANIZATION> were performed in 33 consecutive patients with laryngeal SCC<ORGANIZATION>. Mean nuclear nm23-H1 expression was lower in patients whose disease recurred ( P<PERSON> = .0046 ). Disease-free survival ( DFS<ORGANIZATION> ) was longer for patients whose nuclear nm23-H1 expression was ≥10 % ( P<PERSON> = .0083 ). Nuclear nm23-H1 and E-cadherin expressions correlated directly ( P<PERSON> = .018 ). Mean E-cadherin expression was lower in patients whose disease recurred ( P<PERSON> = .03 ). The DFS<ORGANIZATION> was shorter in patients with ZEB2<ORGANIZATION> expression ≥5 % ( P<PERSON> = .006 ). Nuclear nm23-H1 expression warrants further investigation in laryngeal SCC<ORGANIZATION> as a prognostic marker identifying patients at higher risk of recurrence. nm23-H1 targeted treatments may be capable of regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
