 To investigate the clinical significance of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 expression level in bone marrow of patients with acute non-M3 myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> non-M3 ), and to understand the biological characteristics of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 positive AML expressing lymphoid antigens CD19<ORGANIZATION>, CD56<ORGANIZATION> and its effect on the initially induced remission rate and prognosis. The expression level of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 in bone marrow of 200 patients with newly diagnosed AML<ORGANIZATION> ( non-M3 ) was detected by real-time fluorescent Q-PCR, the expression level of lymphoid antigens was detected by flow cytometry, and the relationship of the initially induced remission rate ( CR1<ORGANIZATION> ) with the overall survival ( OS ) rate was analyzed, the CR1<ORGANIZATION> and OS<ORGANIZATION> differences also were analyzed between CD56 The CD56 The bone marrow CD56<ORGANIZATION>
