 Although exact causes of Parkinson<ORGANIZATION> disease ( PD ) remain enigmatic, mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly appreciated as a key determinant of dopaminergic neuron susceptibility in both familial and sporadic PD. Two genes associated with recessive, early-onset PD encode the ubiquitin ( Ub ) kinase PINK1<ORGANIZATION> and the E3 Ub ligase PRKN/PARK2/Parkin, which together orchestrate a protective mitochondrial quality control ( mitoQC<ORGANIZATION> ) pathway. Upon stress, both enzymes cooperatively identify and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated poly-Ub ( p-S65-Ub ) chains. This specific label is subsequently recognized by autophagy receptors that further facilitate mitochondrial degradation in lysosomes ( mitophagy ). Here, we analyzed human post-mortem brain specimens and identified distinct pools of p-S65-Ub-positive structures that partially colocalized with markers of mitochondria, autophagy, lysosomes and/or granulovacuolar degeneration bodies. We further quantified levels and distribution of the 'mitophagy tag ' in 2 large cohorts of brain samples from normal aging and Lewy<PERSON> body disease ( LBD<ORGANIZATION> ) cases using unbiased digital pathology. Somatic p-S65-Ub structures independently increased with age and disease in distinct brain regions and enhanced levels in LBD<ORGANIZATION> brain were age- and Braak<PERSON> tangle stage-dependent. Additionally, we observed significant correlations of p-S65-Ub with LBs<ORGANIZATION> and neurofibrillary tangle levels in disease. The degree of co-existing p-S65-Ub signals and pathological PD hallmarks increased in the pre-mature stage, but decreased in the late stage of LB or tangle aggregation. Altogether, our study provides further evidence for a potential pathogenic overlap among different forms of PD<ORGANIZATION> and suggests that p-S65-Ub can serve as a biomarker for mitochondrial damage in aging and disease.
