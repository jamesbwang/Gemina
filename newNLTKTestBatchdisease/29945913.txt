 Venous<GPE> thromboembolism ( VTE<ORGANIZATION> ) is the third leading cause of vascular disease and accounts for $ 10 billion in annual US<ORGANIZATION> healthcare costs. The nationwide burden of 30-day readmissions after such events has not been comprehensively assessed. We analyzed adults â‰¥18 years of age with hospitalizations associated with acute VTE<ORGANIZATION> between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, in the Nationwide Readmissions Database<ORGANIZATION>. Nearly 1 in 5 patients with acute VTE were readmitted within 30 days. Predictors and causes of readmission were primarily related to patient characteristics and complications from comorbid conditions, whereas healthcare quality had a moderate impact on readmission risk.
