 Cancer<GPE> immunotherapies, widely heralded as transformational for many adult cancer patients, are becoming viable options for selected subsets of pediatric cancer patients. Many therapies are currently being investigated, from immunomodulatory agents to adoptive cell therapy, bispecific T-cell engagers, oncolytic virotherapy, and checkpoint inhibition. One of the most exciting immunotherapies recently FDA<ORGANIZATION> approved is the use of CD19<ORGANIZATION> chimeric antigen receptor T cells for pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With this approval and others, immunotherapy for pediatric cancers is gaining traction. One of the caveats to many of these immunotherapies is the challenge of predictive biomarkers ; determining which patients will respond to a given therapy is not yet possible. Much research is being focused on which biomarkers will be predictive and prognostic for these patients. Despite many benefits of immunotherapy, including less long-term side effects, some treatments are fraught with immediate side effects that range from mild to severe, although most are manageable. With few downsides and the potential for disease cures, immunotherapy in the pediatric population has the potential to move to the front-line of therapeutic options.
