 An increasing body of data has shown that erythropoietin ( EPO<ORGANIZATION> ) plays multiple roles in inflammation control and immunoregulation. However, less attention has been given to its effects on lupus nephritis ( LN ). In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of EPO<ORGANIZATION> on LN in MRL/lpr mice, a well-studied animal model for lupus. MRL/lpr mice were randomly divided into an EPO<ORGANIZATION> and control group. Mice in the EPO<ORGANIZATION> group were treated with EPO<ORGANIZATION> ; saline was given to the control group. Both groups were treated for 10 weeks. We analyzed the differences of general disease condition, histopathologic changes, Th<GPE> lymphocytes subsets, and the expression of inflammatory factors of mice between the groups. Compared to the control group, mice in the EPO<ORGANIZATION> group showed less spleen hyperplasia, less urinary protein, and lower serum anti-dsDNA antibody ; they also had lower renal histopathologic scores and less deposition of IgG/C3 within glomeruli. Moreover, Th1<PERSON> and Th17<ORGANIZATION> levels were decreased, while Th2<PERSON> and Treg<ORGANIZATION> levels were increased in the spleen, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines decreased in both the spleen and kidneys. EPO<ORGANIZATION> increased Th2<PERSON> and Treg<ORGANIZATION> lymphocytes, decreased Th1<PERSON>, Th17<PERSON> lymphocytes in the spleen, and inhibited the inflammatory reactions in both the spleen and kidneys, thus ameliorating LN of MRL/lpr mice.
