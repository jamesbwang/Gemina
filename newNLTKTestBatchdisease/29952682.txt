 Injury<GPE> to lacrimal glands represents a major health problem after radiation therapy of the head and neck malignancies. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate significant ultrastructural changes of lacrimal glands and some of their underlying mechanisms following the exposure to different fractionated doses of irradiation. In this study, 28 Sprague Dawley<PERSON> ( SD ) rats were assigned to four groups ( seven rats each ): Group I acted as control and received no irradiation. Groups<PERSON> II-IV received fractionated irradiation of 5 Gy ( 100 cGy/fraction daily for 5 days ), 9 Gy ( 300 cGy/fraction daily for 3 days ), and 20 Gy ( one fraction ), respectively. One month after the experiment, examination of lacrimal glands with transmission electron microscopy ( TEM<ORGANIZATION> ) demonstrated dose-dependent ultrastructural changes in the lacrimal acinar and intralobular ductal epithelial cells. In the acinar cells, there were swollen rough endoplasmic reticulum, irregularly shaped nuclei with chromatin condensation, mitochondrial damage, and retention of secretory granules. Intaralobular ductal epithelial cells showed loss of surface microvilli and damage to mitochondria. In addition to the potential direct effects of irradiation on lacrimal acinar and intralobular ductal epithelial cells, damage to blood vessels and nerve endings seemed to mediate some of the underlying mechanisms of these irradiation-induced ultrastructural changes. In conclusion, using TEM<ORGANIZATION> reveals that lacrimal gland is highly sensitive to even small doses of irradiation therapy ; in addition, swelling of rough endoplasmic reticulum and aberrant nuclei are the most encountered structural changes. Damage<PERSON> to blood vessels and nerve endings might mediate some of the underlying mechanisms of irradiation-induced secondary injury in lacrimal glands.
