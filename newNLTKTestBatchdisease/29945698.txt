 The 2015/16 influenza season was the third season of the introduction of an intra-nasally administered live attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV<ORGANIZATION> ) for children in England<GPE>. All children aged 2‒6 years were offered LAIV<ORGANIZATION>, and in addition, a series of geographically discrete areas piloted vaccinating school-age children 7‒11 years old. Influenza A ( H1N1<ORGANIZATION> ) pdm09 was the dominant circulating strain during 2015/16 followed by influenza B. We measured influenza vaccine uptake and the overall and indirect effect of vaccinating children of primary school -age, by comparing cumulative disease incidence in targeted and non-targeted age groups in vaccine pilot and non-pilot areas in England<GPE>. Uptake<PERSON> of 57.9 % ( range: 43.6-72.0 ) was achieved in the five pilot areas for children aged 5‒11 years. In pilot areas, cumulative emergency department respiratory attendances, influenza-confirmed hospitalisations and intensive care unit admissions were consistently lower, albeit mostly non-significantly, in targeted and non-targeted age groups compared with non-pilot areas. Effect sizes were less for adults and more severe endpoints. Vaccination of healthy primary school-age children with LAIV<ORGANIZATION> at moderately high levels continues to be associated with population-level reductions in influenza-related respiratory illness. Further work to evaluate the population-level impact of the programme is required.
