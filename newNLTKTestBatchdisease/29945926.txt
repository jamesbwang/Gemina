 Recurrence<GPE> is one of the major causes of poor prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ), and drug resistance is closely associated with disease recurrence. Histone deacetylase ( HDAC<ORGANIZATION> ) inhibitor scriptaid functions as an anti-cancer agent in many different types of tumors, but its possible roles in HCC<ORGANIZATION> progression have not been explored to date. Herein<PERSON>, we show that HDAC<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor scriptaid decreases HCC<ORGANIZATION> cell proliferation and induces cell cycle G2/M phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, scriptaid triggered HCC<ORGANIZATION> cell death via transcriptional activation of p21 and subsequent elevated global H3Ac levels. Importantly, we found that scriptaid showed robust anti-tumor activity against HCC<ORGANIZATION>. Thus, our findings indicate that HDAC<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor scriptaid could be an important potential candidate for treatment of HCC<ORGANIZATION> patients.
