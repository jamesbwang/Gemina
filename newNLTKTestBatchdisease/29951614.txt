 Bariatric<GPE> surgery is an accepted treatment option for severe obesity. Previous analysis of the independently collected Hospital Episode Statistics<ORGANIZATION> ( HES<ORGANIZATION> ) data for outcomes after bariatric surgery demonstrated a 30-day postoperative mortality rate of 0·3 per cent in the English National Health Service<ORGANIZATION> ( NHS<ORGANIZATION> ). However, there have been no published mortality data for bariatric procedures performed since 2008. This study aimed to assess mortality related to bariatric surgery in England<GPE> from 2009. HES<ORGANIZATION> data were used to identify all patients who had primary bariatric surgery from 2009 to 2016. Clinical<PERSON> codes were used selectively to identify all primary bariatric procedures but exclude revision or conversion procedures and operations for malignant or other benign disease. The primary outcome measures were HES<ORGANIZATION> in-hospital and Office for National Statistics<ORGANIZATION> ( ONS<ORGANIZATION> ) 30-day mortality after discharge. A total of 41 241 primary bariatric procedures were carried out in the NHS<ORGANIZATION> between 2009 and 2016, with 29 in-hospital deaths ( 0·07 per cent ). The 30-day mortality rate after discharge was 0·08 per cent ( 32 of 41 241 ). Both the in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates after discharge demonstrated a downward trend over the study period. Overall in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates remain very low after primary bariatric surgery. An increased uptake of bariatric surgery within the English<ORGANIZATION> NHS has been safe.
