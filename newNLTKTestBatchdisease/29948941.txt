 This study revealed multifaceted regulation of ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> by Cdk5<PERSON> in Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ) pathogenesis. ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> is a multifunctional enzyme with dehydrogenase, esterase, and anti-oxidant activities. ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> is also a major regulator of retinoic acid ( RA ) signaling, which is critical for normal brain homeostasis. We identified ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> as both physiological and pathological target of Cdk5<GPE>. First, under neurotoxic conditions, Cdk5-induced oxidative stress upregulates ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> transcription. Second, Cdk5<PERSON> increases ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> levels by preventing its ubiquitylation via direct phosphorylation. Third<PERSON>, ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation increases its dehydrogenase activity by altering its tetrameric state to a highly active monomeric state. Fourth<PERSON>, persistent oxidative stress triggered by deregulated Cdk5 inactivates ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION>. Thus, initially, the good Cdk5 attempts to mitigate ensuing oxidative stress by upregulating ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> via phosphorylation and paradoxically by increasing oxidative stress. Later, sustained oxidative stress generated by Cdk5<ORGANIZATION> inhibits ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> activity, leading to neurotoxicity. ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> upregulation is highly neuroprotective. In human AD tissues, ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> levels increase with disease severity. However, ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> activity was highest at mild and moderate stages, but declines significantly at severe stage. These findings confirm that during the initial stages, neurons attempt to upregulate and activate ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION> to protect from accruing oxidative stress-induced damage ; however, persistently deleterious conditions inactivate ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION>, further contributing to neurotoxicity. This study thus revealed two faces of Cdk5<GPE>, good and bad in neuronal function and survival, with a single substrate, ALDH1A1<ORGANIZATION>. The bad Cdk5 prevails in the end, overriding the good Cdk5 act, suggesting that Cdk5<PERSON> is an effective therapeutic target for AD<ORGANIZATION>.
