 To compare unassisted and CAD-assisted detection and time efficiency of radiologists in reporting lung nodules on CT scans taken from patients with extra-thoracic malignancies using a Cloud-based system. Three radiologists searched for pulmonary nodules in patients with extra-thoracic malignancy who underwent CT ( slice thickness/spacing 2 mm/1.7 mm ) between September 2015 and March 2016. All nodules detected by unassisted reading were measured and coordinates were uploaded on a cloud-based system. CAD marks were then reviewed by the same readers using the cloud-based interface. To establish the reference standard all nodules ≥ 3 mm detected by at least one radiologist were validated by two additional experienced radiologists in consensus. Reader<PERSON> detection rate and reporting time with and without CAD<ORGANIZATION> were compared. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. All patients signed written informed consent. The series included 225 patients ( age range 21-90 years, mean 62 years ), including 75 patients having at least one nodule, for a total of 215 nodules. Stand-alone CAD sensitivity for lesions ≥ 3 mm was 85 % ( 183/215, 95 % CI: 82-91 ) ; mean false-positive rate per scan was 3.8. Sensitivity across readers in detecting lesions ≥ 3 mm was statistically higher using CAD<ORGANIZATION>: 65 % ( 95 % CI: 61-69 ) versus 88 % ( 95 % CI: 86-91, p < 0.01 ). Reading time increased by 11 % using CAD<ORGANIZATION> ( 296 s vs. 329 s ; p < 0.05 ). In patients with extra-thoracic malignancies, CAD-assisted reading improves detection of ≥ 3-mm lung nodules on CT, slightly increasing reading time. • CAD-assisted reading improves the detection of lung nodules compared with unassisted reading on CT scans of patients with primary extra-thoracic tumour, slightly increasing reading time. • Cloud-based CAD<ORGANIZATION> systems may represent a cost-effective solution since CAD<ORGANIZATION> results can be reviewed while a separated cloud back-end is taking care of computations. • Early identification of lung nodules by CAD-assisted interpretation of CT<ORGANIZATION> scans in patients with extra-thoracic primary tumours is of paramount importance as it could anticipate surgery and extend patient life expectancy.
