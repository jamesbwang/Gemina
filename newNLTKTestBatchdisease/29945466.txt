 Prior to the sequencing of the human genome, it was presumed that most of the DNA<ORGANIZATION> coded for proteins. However, with the advent of next-generation sequencing, it has now been recognized that most complex eukaryotic genomes are in fact transcribed into noncoding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( ncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ), including a family of transcripts referred to as long noncoding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ). LncRNAs have been implicated in many biological processes ranging from housekeeping functions such as transcription to more specialized functions such as dosage compensation or genomic imprinting, among others. Interestingly, lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> are not limited to a defined set of functions but can regulate varied activities such as messenger RNA<ORGANIZATION> degradation, translation, and protein kinetics or function as RNA<ORGANIZATION> decoys or scaffolds. Although still in its infancy, research into the biology of lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> has demonstrated the importance of lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in development and disease. However, the specific mechanisms through which these lncRNAs act remain poorly defined. Focused research into a small number of these lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> has provided important clues into the heterogeneous nature of this family of ncRNAs<ORGANIZATION>. Due<PERSON> to the complex diversity of lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> function, in this review, we provide an update on the platforms available for investigators to aid in the identification of lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> function.
