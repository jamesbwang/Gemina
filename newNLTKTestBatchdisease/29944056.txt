 Downy<GPE> mildew disease, caused by the obligate oomycete pathogen Peronospora effusa, is the most important economic constraint for spinach production. Three races ( races 12, 13, and 14 ) of P. effusa have been sequenced and assembled. The draft genomes of these three races have been deposited to GenBank<ORGANIZATION> and provide useful resources for dissecting the interaction between the host and the pathogen and may provide a framework for determining the mechanism by which new races of the pathogen are rapidly emerging.
