 Rotavirus<GPE> is the leading cause of acute watery diarrhoea among children and is vaccine preventable. The aim of this hospital-based sentinel surveillance was to study the prevalence, demographic and clinical characteristics of rotavirus infections and to describe rotavirus genotype distribution patterns among children under five years of age hospitalized for acute watery diarrhea during the period of 2009-2016. Prospective, sentinel hospital-based surveillance was conducted in Lady<GPE> Ridgeway Hospital ( LRH<ORGANIZATION> ) from 2009 to 2016. Stool samples of children admitted with acute watery diarrhea were tested by rotavirus antigen detection 'ProSpecT ' Enzyme Immunoassay<PERSON> ( EIA<ORGANIZATION> ) at Department<ORGANIZATION> of Virology<GPE>, Medical Research Institute<PERSON>, Colombo<GPE>. Specimens that tested positive for rotavirus were further analyzed at the Regional Reference Laboratory<ORGANIZATION> ( RRL<ORGANIZATION> ) participating in the World<ORGANIZATION> Health Organization ( WHO<ORGANIZATION> ) -coordinated Global Rotavirus Surveillance Network<PERSON> ( GRSN<ORGANIZATION> ) to determine the genotype of strains by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Of the 6090 children with diarrhea admitted, 1801 ( 29.5 % ) had stools taken and tested. In years with at least 11 months of data ( 2010 and 2013 ) rotavirus was detected in 36.5 % ( 228/624 ) of specimens. Genotype G1P<PERSON> [ 8 ] was the most common genotype detected throughout the surveillance period ( 30.1 % ; 123/408 ) with G2P<PERSON> [ 8 ], G9P<PERSON> [ 8 ] and G3P<PERSON> [ 8 ] also detected. Rotavirus<PERSON> is a common cause of pediatric diarrhea hospitalizations in Sri Lanka<GPE>. National introduction of rotavirus vaccine could reduce the burden of pediatric diarrhea.
