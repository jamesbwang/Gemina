 Recently, several randomized controlled trials ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) explored the effects of α-blockers with or without phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors ( PDE5-Is ) for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia ( LUTS/BPH ). However, the results were inconsistent. We performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the role of combination therapy ( α-blockers and PDE5-Is ) in patients with LUTS/BPH. Databases including PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Cochrane<GPE> library, Web of Science<GPE>, and Embase<PERSON> were searched for qualified RCTs<ORGANIZATION>. Pooled mean differences ( MDs<ORGANIZATION> ) and odds ratios ( ORs<ORGANIZATION> ) were calculated to measure the effects and adverse events in combination therapy. Moreover, subgroup analyses of ethnicity, dosage of PDE5-Is, treatment duration, and severity of LUTS/BPH were performed. In addition, trial sequential analyses ( TSAs<ORGANIZATION> ) were used to assess whether the evidence for the results was sufficient. Overall, this study identified 11 eligible RCTs<ORGANIZATION>, including 855 LUTS/BPH patients. Patients receiving combination therapy had better improvement in international prostate symptom score ( IPSS<ORGANIZATION>: MD: 1.66, 95 % CI<ORGANIZATION> - 3.03 to - 0.29 ), maximum urinary flow rate ( Q Our results indicated that combination therapy can significantly improve IPSS<ORGANIZATION>, Q
