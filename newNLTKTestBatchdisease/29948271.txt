 To assess the clinical behavior of inactive caries lesion on the occlusal sites of permanent molars over 4-5 years and to estimate the risk for progression of caries-inactive sites compared with sound ones. Clinical<PERSON> examinations were conducted at baseline ( n = 258 ) and after 4-5 years and included the recording of dental plaque and dental caries at the occlusal surfaces and the eruption stage of each permanent molar. One hudred ninety-three schoolchildren were followed ( response rate of 74.8 % ), totalizing 1152 teeth. Of the children, 30.6 % ( n = 59 ) presented at least one molar containing an active lesion, filling, or that had been extracted ; according to the activity criterion, inactive lesions presented around a twofold increased risk for caries progression than sound surfaces ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 2.34 95 % CI = 1.51-3.62 ). Thirteen percent ( n = 25 ) of the children presented at least one molar progressing to dentine cavity, filling, or extraction ; according to the severity criterion, inactive caries lesions presented a significantly higher risk for progression when compared with sound surfaces ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 2.69, 95 % CI = 1.50-4.83 ). The vast majority of lesions ( 85-90 % ) identified as inactive enamel caries at baseline did not progress over 4-5 years. Despite this fact, it was possible to detect an increased risk for caries progression in caries-inactive occlusal sites compared with the sound ones. Considering the low progression rates, inactive caries lesions do not need a specific caries-controlling treatment and should be monitored longitudinally in the same manner as sound surfaces.
