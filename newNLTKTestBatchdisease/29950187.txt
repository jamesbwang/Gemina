 Diagnosis<GPE> of cystic echinococcosis ( CE ) is at present mainly based on imaging techniques. Serology<PERSON> has a complementary role, partly due to the small number of standardized and commercially available assays. Therefore we examined the clinical performance of the SERION<ORGANIZATION> ELISA classic Echinococcus IgG test. Using 10 U/ml as a cut-off point, and serum samples from 50 CE patients and 105 healthy controls, the sensitivity and specificity were 98.0 % and 96.2 %, respectively. If patients with other infectious diseases were used as negative controls, the specificity decreased to 76.9 %, which causes poor positive predictive values. However, if results between 10 and 15 U/ml are classified as indecisive, the specificity of positive results ( â‰¥15 U/ml ) increased to 92.5 % without greatly affecting the sensitivity ( 92.0 % ). Using this approach in combination with imaging studies, the SERION<ORGANIZATION> ELISA classic Echinococcosis<ORGANIZATION> IgG test can be a useful aid in the diagnosis of CE<ORGANIZATION>.
