 Annual<GPE> global deaths from cryptococcal meningitis ( CM ) are estimated at 180 000 and mortality is as high as 30 %, even with optimal therapy. VT-1598 is a novel fungal CYP51<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor with potent intrinsic antifungal activity against Cryptococcus<GPE>. We report here VT-1598 's in vivo antifungal activity in a murine model of CM<ORGANIZATION>. Single-dose plasma and brain pharmacokinetics in mice and MIC<ORGANIZATION> for Cryptococcus<ORGANIZATION> neoformans H99 were determined prior to efficacy studies. Short-course monotherapy and combination doses were explored with the endpoint of brain fungal burden. A survival study was also conducted using monotherapy treatment with fungal burden measured after a 6 day drug washout. Oral doses of VT-1598 had good plasma and brain exposure and resulted in significant ( P<PERSON> < 0.0001 ) and dose-dependent reductions in brain fungal burden, reaching a 6 log10 reduction. Unlike either positive drug control ( fluconazole or liposomal amphotericin B ), both mid and high doses of VT-1598 reduced fungal burden to below levels measured at the start of treatment. When VT-1598<PERSON> was dosed in the survival study, no VT-1598-treated animal succumbed to the infection. Whereas<PERSON> fluconazole showed a 2.5 log10 increase in fungal burden after the 6 day washout, the VT-1598 mid- and high-dose animals showed almost no regrowth ( < 0.5 log10 ). In a separate fungal burden study using suboptimal doses of VT-1598 and liposomal amphotericin B to probe for combination effects, each combination had a positive effect relative to corresponding monotherapies. These pre-clinical in vivo data strongly support clinical investigation of VT-1598 as a novel therapy for this lethal infection.
