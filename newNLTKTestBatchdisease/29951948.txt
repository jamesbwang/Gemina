 Immunoglobulin<PERSON> G ( IgG<ORGANIZATION> ) replacement therapy is a standard treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases ( PIDs<ORGANIZATION> ). Hizentra®, a 20 % human subcutaneous IgG<ORGANIZATION> ( SCIG<ORGANIZATION> ), is approved for biweekly administration for PIDs<ORGANIZATION>. The aim of the multicenter IBIS<ORGANIZATION> study was to prospectively investigate the efficacy of biweekly Hizentra® compared with previous IVIG<ORGANIZATION> or SCIG<ORGANIZATION> treatment regimens in patients with PIDs<ORGANIZATION>. The study consisted of a 12-month retrospective period followed by 12-month prospective observational period. The main endpoints included pre-infusion IgG<ORGANIZATION> concentrations, proportion of patients with serious bacterial infections ( SBIs<ORGANIZATION> ), other infections, hospitalizations due to PID-related illnesses, and days with antibiotics during the study periods. Of the 36 patients enrolled in the study, 35 patients continued the study ( mean age 26.1 ± 14.4 years ; 68.6 % male ). The mean pre-infusion IgG<ORGANIZATION> levels for prior immunoglobulin regimens during the retrospective period ( 7.84 ± 2.09 g/L ) and the prospective period ( 8.55 ± 1.76 g/L ) did not show any significant variations ( p = 0.4964 ). The mean annual rate of SBIs/patient was 0.063 ± 0.246 for both prospective and retrospective periods. No hospitalizations related to PIDs<ORGANIZATION> were reported during the prospective period versus one in the retrospective period. All patients were either very ( 76.5 % ) or quite ( 23.5 % ) satisfied with biweekly Hizentra® at the end of the study. In conclusion, the IBIS<ORGANIZATION> study provided real-world evidence on the efficacy of biweekly Hizentra® in patients with PIDs<ORGANIZATION>, thus verifying the data generated by the pharmacometric modeling and simulation study in a normal clinical setting.
