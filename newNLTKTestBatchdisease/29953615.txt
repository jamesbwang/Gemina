 We present an ultrahigh-vacuum ( UHV<ORGANIZATION> ) -sealed high-stability scanning tunnelling microscope ( STM<ORGANIZATION> ) that can be entirely immersed in liquid helium and readily used in a commercial Dewar or superconducting magnet. The STM<ORGANIZATION> head features a horizontal microscanner that can become standalone and ultrastable when the coarse approach inertial motor retracts. Low<PERSON> voltage is enough to operate the STM<ORGANIZATION> even at low temperature owing to the powerful motor. It is housed in a tubular chamber of 49 mm outer diameter, which can be pumped via a detachable valve ( DV ), UHV-sealed and remain sealed after the DV<ORGANIZATION> is removed. The entire so-sealed chamber can then be inserted into liquid helium, where in situ sample cleavage is done via vacuum bellow. This allows sample cleavage and STM<ORGANIZATION> measurements to take place in better UHV with higher cooling power. Quality atomic resolution images of graphite and charge density wave on 1T-TiSe
