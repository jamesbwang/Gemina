 Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is a heterogeneous disease with many challenges for clinicians and patients alike. However, for the most part of the last three decades, treatment and outcomes for patients with this disease have not changed a lot. With recent advances in immunooncology leading to the approval of multiple agents for the metastatic setting, the treatment landscape started to change. With the emergent data from landmark multi-institutional sequencing projects as well as molecular data from recent trials, our understanding of the underlying disease biology, response patterns as well as definition of molecular subtypes has evolved tremendously. This review aims to summarize the currently available concepts of mutational profiles and molecular subtypes as well as their implications for management of urothelial carcinoma.
