 Liver<GPE> fibrosis is a health challenge requiring alternative therapeutic approaches. Cilostazol<PERSON> is a selective phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. Sirtuin1 ( SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> ) is a member of the silent information regulator 2 family. Cilostazol<PERSON> upregulates SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> expression. Cilostazol<PERSON> protects against the cholestatic liver insults caused by bile duct obstruction. Involvement of SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> pathway in this protective effect has not been studied yet. So, we hypothesized that SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> signaling may have a role in cilostazol protective effects against bile duct ligation induced liver damages. Rats were subjected to common bile duct ligation then treated with cilostazol ( 9mg/kg or 27mg/kg ) in the presence or absence of specific SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor EX527<ORGANIZATION>. Cilostazol<PERSON> improved liver function, reduced inflammation, enhanced antioxidant status, ameliorated cholestatic liver injury and upregulated hepatic SIRT1<ORGANIZATION>. However, these protective effects were abrogated by EX527<ORGANIZATION> suggesting that SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> signaling may have a role in these effects. Conclusion, cilostazol in a dose dependent way produced hepatoprotective effect via anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antifibrotic effects which were mediated, in part, through SIRT1upregulation<ORGANIZATION>.
