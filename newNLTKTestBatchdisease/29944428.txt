 This article reports the finding of a small non-controlled evaluation over a 2-week period in three different care settings: a residential care home, an acute stroke unit and a community intermediate care hospital. At initial recruitment 30 patients were identified by clinical assessment as being at high risk of developing a heel pressure ulcer. Further inclusion criteria were identifying heels that had signs of pressure damage occurring, blanching and non-blanching erythema, blistering and category 2 ulceration. In all, 15 patients fully completed the evaluation over a 14-day period. The mean age was 86 years. The low-friction bootee was worn constantly while in bed and seated in chairs, only being removed for heel checks and hygiene care. No patients were independently mobile during the evaluation ; products were not worn to walk in due to a risk of falling-patients in the community hospital who had to mobilise for rehabilitation removed the bootees for this activity. All had pressure mapping and ultrasound of pedal pulses prior and after evaluation by the tissue viability specialist nurse. Results of pressure mapping showed a reduction of peak heel pressures on application of the bootees and a final review of reduction in visual signs of heel damage, reduced pain, increased comfort and ease of use. These results indicate that a standardised care pathway approach to heel protection using low-friction heel bootees is effective in all care settings for the reduction and prevention of heel pressure damage.
