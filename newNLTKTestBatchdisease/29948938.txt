 Ischemic<GPE> stroke ( IS ) is a leading disease with high mortality and disability, as well as with limited therapeutic window. Biomarkers for earlier diagnosis of IS have long been pursued. Family<PERSON> and twin studies confirm that genetic variations play an important role in IS pathogenesis. Besides DNA<ORGANIZATION> mutations found previously by genetic linkage analysis for monogenic IS ( Mendelian<GPE> inheritance ), recent studies using genome-wide associated study ( GWAS<ORGANIZATION> ) and microRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression profiling have resulted in a large number of DNA<ORGANIZATION> and microRNA<ORGANIZATION> biomarkers in polygenic IS ( sporadic IS ), especially in different IS subtypes and imaging phenotypes. The present review summarizes genetic markers discovered by clinical studies and discusses their pathogenic molecular mechanisms involved in developmental or regenerative anomalies of blood vessel walls, neuronal apoptosis, excitotoxic death, inflammation, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis. The possible impact of environment on genetics is addressed as well. We also include a perspective on further studies and clinical application of these IS biomarkers.
