 The remarkable progress made in confronting the global HIV epidemic offers a unique opportunity to address the increasing threat of noncommunicable diseases ( NCDs<ORGANIZATION> ). However, questions remain about how to enhance the HIV<ORGANIZATION> platforms to deliver integrated HIV and NCD<ORGANIZATION> care to people living with HIV<ORGANIZATION> ( PLHIV<ORGANIZATION> ) in sub-Saharan Africa<GPE> ( SSA<ORGANIZATION> ). We aimed to develop a priority research agenda to advance this effort. Researchers, policymakers, and implementers from the United States<GPE> and SSA<ORGANIZATION> conducted three scoping reviews on HIV/NCD prevention and care focused on clinical, health system, and community levels. Based on the review findings and expert inputs, we conducted iterative consensus-development activities to generate a prioritized research agenda. Population-level data on NCD<ORGANIZATION> prevalence among PLHIV<ORGANIZATION> in SSA are sparse. The review identified NCD<ORGANIZATION> screening and management approaches that could be integrated into HIV<ORGANIZATION> programs in SSA<ORGANIZATION>. However, few studies focused on the effectiveness, cost, and best practices for integrated chronic care platforms, making it difficult to derive policy recommendations. To address these gaps, we propose a prioritized research agenda focused on developing evidence-based service delivery models, increasing human capacity through workforce education, generating data through informatics platforms and research, managing the medication supply chain, developing new financing and sustainability models, advancing research-informed policy, and addressing other crosscutting health system issues. Based on collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts, a research agenda was developed to provide guidance that advances efforts to adapt the current health system to deliver integrated chronic care for PLHIV<ORGANIZATION> and the population at large.
