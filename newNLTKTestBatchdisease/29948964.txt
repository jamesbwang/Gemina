 Treatments for metastatic pancreatic cancer include monotherapy with gemcitabine ( GEM<ORGANIZATION> ) ; combinations of GEM<ORGANIZATION> with oxaliplatin ( OX<ORGANIZATION> + GEM ), cisplatin ( CIS<ORGANIZATION> + GEM ), capecitabine ( CAP<ORGANIZATION> + GEM ), or nab-paclitaxel ( NAB-P + GEM ) ; and the non-GEM combination FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION>. Combination therapies have yielded better survival outcomes than GEM<ORGANIZATION> alone. A sponsor-independent economic evaluation of these regimens has not been conducted for USA<ORGANIZATION>. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost utility and cost effectiveness of these regimens from the payer perspective for USA<ORGANIZATION>. A three-state Markov<PERSON> model ( progression-free, progressed disease, death ) simulating the total costs and health outcomes ( quality-adjusted life-years ; life-years ) was developed to estimate the incremental cost-utility and cost-effectiveness ratios. FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION> clinical data were obtained from trial and indirect estimates were obtained from network meta-analyses. Lifetime horizon and 3 % /year discount rates were used. FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION> was the most expensive regimen and GEM the least costly regimen. Compared to GEM<ORGANIZATION>, all but one ( CIS<ORGANIZATION> + GEM ) regimen were found to be more effective in quality-adjusted life-years and life-years. Compared to GEM<ORGANIZATION>, the incremental cost-utility ratios for CAP<ORGANIZATION> + GEM, OX-GEM, NAB-P + GEM, and FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION>, were US<GPE> $ 180,503, US<GSP> $ 197,993, US<GSP> $ 204,833, and US<GSP> $ 265,718 per additional quality-adjusted life-year, respectively ; and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were US<GPE> $ 88,181, US<GSP> $ 87,620, US<GSP> $ 135,683, and US<GSP> $ 167,040 per additional life-year, respectively. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the base-case analysis. This sponsor-independent economic evaluation for USA<ORGANIZATION> found that OX<ORGANIZATION> + GEM, CAP<ORGANIZATION> + GEM, FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION>, and NAB-P + GEM, but not CIS<ORGANIZATION> + GEM, were more expensive but also more effective than GEM<ORGANIZATION> alone in terms of quality-adjusted life-years and life-years gained. The NAB-P + GEM regimen appears to be the most cost effective in USA<ORGANIZATION> at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US<GPE> $ 200,000/quality-adjusted life-year.
