 In MRI<ORGANIZATION>, subject motion results in image artifacts. High-resolution 3D scans, like MPRAGE<ORGANIZATION>, are particularly susceptible to motion because of long scan times and acquisition of data over multiple-shots. Such motion related artifacts have been shown to cause a bias in cortical measures extracted from segmentation of high-resolution MPRAGE<ORGANIZATION> images. Prospective motion correction ( PMC<ORGANIZATION> ) techniques have been developed to help mitigate artifacts due to subject motion. In this work, high-resolution MPRAGE<ORGANIZATION> images are acquired during intentional head motion to evaluate the effectiveness of navigator-based PMC<ORGANIZATION> techniques to improve both the accuracy and reproducibility of cortical morphometry measures obtained from image segmentation. The contribution of reacquiring segments of k-space affected by motion to the overall performance of PMC<ORGANIZATION> is assessed. Additionally, the effect of subject motion on subcortical structure volumes is investigated. In the presence of head motion, navigator-based PMC<ORGANIZATION> is shown to improve both the accuracy and reproducibility of cortical and subcortical measures. It is shown that reacquiring segments of k-space data that are corrupted by motion is an essential part of navigator-based PMC<ORGANIZATION> performance. Subcortical structure volumes are not affected by motion in the same way as cortical measures ; there is not a consistent underestimation.
