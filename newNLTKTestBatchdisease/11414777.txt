 [ Purpose<PERSON> ] Most studies on bodyblade exercise have examined changes in muscle activities in the trunk and shoulders according to the hand position or direction while in a standing position. The present study compared and examined the changes in muscle activities around the shoulders and trunk according to different bodyblade lifting methods during stabilization exercise in a quadruped position. [ Subjects and Methods<ORGANIZATION> ] The present study was conducted on 20 healthy males. The following exercise four types were performed with the bodyblade held by flexing the dominant arm at 180Â° in a quadruped position. The muscle activity and the ratio of muscle activity were measured. [ Results<PERSON> ] The SA<ORGANIZATION> and IO<ORGANIZATION>, EO<ORGANIZATION> muscles showed significant differences. Moreover, the SA/UT activity ratio showed significant differences according to the type of exercise. The Tukey<GPE> 's post hoc test results were as follows: for the SA<ORGANIZATION> muscle, exercise types 4, 2 were more effective than types 1, 3: and for the IO<ORGANIZATION> muscle, types 1, 2 were more effective than types 3, 4. [ Conclusion ] The present study showed that type 2 scapular stabilization exercise ( crossed leg lifting with the hand raised above the head on a vertical plane ) showed selective and positive effects on trunk muscle strengthening and stabilization. In future, additional studies are required to design effective exercise programs for pain management and improvement of muscle activities in patients with complaints of shoulder pain due to scapular winging.
