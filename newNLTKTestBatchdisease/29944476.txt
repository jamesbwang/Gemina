 The PRAMI<ORGANIZATION> and CvLPRIT<ORGANIZATION> trials support preventive percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI<ORGANIZATION> ) for multivessel coronary disease found during ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI<ORGANIZATION> ). We assess our real-world experience of the management of multivessel disease identified during primary PCI<ORGANIZATION> ( PPCI<ORGANIZATION> ) in a large UK regional centre. All STEMI patients who underwent culprit-only PPCI<ORGANIZATION> during the study period ( August 2011 to August 2013 ) were retrospectively assessed for eligibility to each trial. The two resulting groups were designated as the 'observational ' cohorts. Primary outcomes were then determined and compared with the culprit-only revascularisation cohorts from the respective published randomized controlled trials ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ). A total of 1143 consecutive cases were presented during the study period. Of these, 343 would have been suitable for inclusion to PRAMI<ORGANIZATION> and were included in the 'observational PRAMI<ORGANIZATION> ' cohort ; 196 patients were included in the 'observational CvLPRIT<ORGANIZATION> ' cohort.The 'observational PRAMI<ORGANIZATION> ' cohort experienced fewer primary outcome events ( 13.1 vs. 22.9 % ), cardiac deaths ( 0.6 vs. 4.3 % ) and nonfatal myocardial infarctions ( 3.5 vs. 8.7 % ) than the culprit-only PCI<ORGANIZATION> PRAMI cohort ( n=231 ) ; there were significantly more diabetics ( P=0.022 ) and anterior STEMI<ORGANIZATION> initial presentations in the culprit-only PCI<ORGANIZATION> PRAMI cohort. Primary outcomes were comparable to those of the preventive PCI<ORGANIZATION> PRAMI cohort.The 'observational CvLPRIT<ORGANIZATION> ' cohort showed no significant difference in primary outcomes over 12 months ( 16.8 vs. 21.2 % ), but significantly lower all-cause mortality ( 2 vs. 6.9 % ) than the culprit-only PCI<ORGANIZATION> CvPLRIT cohort ( n=146 ). The 30-day event rates were similar to the preventive PCI<ORGANIZATION> arm ; the 12-month events were better than the nonpreventive, but not as good as the preventive RCT<ORGANIZATION> cohorts. Outcomes from culprit-only primary PCI<ORGANIZATION> for multivessel disease in patients selected by the RCT<ORGANIZATION> criteria from an all-comers population representing real-life experience are better than those published in the two main RCTs<ORGANIZATION>. The RCTs<ORGANIZATION> may have selected a high-risk population for study exaggerating the benefits of preventive PCI<ORGANIZATION>.
