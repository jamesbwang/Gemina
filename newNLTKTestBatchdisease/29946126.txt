 Pseudomonas<GPE> aeruginosa evolves during chronic pulmonary infections of cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients, forming pathoadapted variants that are persistent. Mucoid<PERSON> and rugose small-colony variants ( RSCVs<ORGANIZATION> ) are typically isolated from sputum of CF<ORGANIZATION> patients. These variants overproduce exopolysaccharides in the biofilm extracellular polymeric substance ( EPS<ORGANIZATION> ). Currently<PERSON>, changes to the biophysical properties of RSCV<ORGANIZATION> and mucoid biofilms due to variations in EPS are not well understood. This knowledge may reveal how lung infections resist host clearance mechanisms. Here, we used mechanical indentation and shear rheometry to analyse the viscoelasticity of RSCV<ORGANIZATION> and mucoid colony-biofilms compared to their isogenic parent at 2-, 4-, and 6-d. While the viscoelasticity of parental colony-biofilms underwent fluctuating temporal changes, in contrast, RSCV<ORGANIZATION> and mucoid colony-biofilms showed a gradual progression to more elastic-solid behaviour. Theoretical indices of mucociliary and cough clearance predict that mature 6-d parental and RSCV<ORGANIZATION> biofilms may show reduced cough clearance from the lung, while early mucoid biofilms may show reduced clearance by both mechanisms. We propose that viscoelasticity be considered a virulence property of biofilms.
