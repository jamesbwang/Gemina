 Despite the importance of type I interferon ( IFN-I ) in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE<ORGANIZATION> ) pathogenesis, the mechanisms of IFN-I production have not been fully elucidated. Recognition of nucleic acids by DNA<ORGANIZATION> sensors induces IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs<ORGANIZATION> ), but the involvement of cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( GMP<ORGANIZATION> ) -AMP synthase ( cGAS<ORGANIZATION> ) and stimulator of interferon genes ( STING ) in SLE<ORGANIZATION> remains unclear. We studied the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in the IFN-I-producing cascade driven by SLE<ORGANIZATION> serum. We collected sera from patients with SLE<ORGANIZATION> ( n=64 ), patients with other autoimmune diseases ( n=31 ) and healthy controls ( n=35 ), and assayed them using a cell-based reporter system that enables highly sensitive detection of IFN-I and ISG-inducing activity. We used Toll-like receptor-specific reporter cells and reporter cells harbouring knockouts of cGAS<ORGANIZATION>, STING and IFNAR2<ORGANIZATION> to evaluate signalling pathway-dependent ISG<ORGANIZATION> induction. IFN-I bioactivity and ISG-inducing activities of serum were higher in patients with SLE<ORGANIZATION> than in patients with other autoimmune diseases or healthy controls. ISG-inducing activity of SLE<ORGANIZATION> sera was significantly reduced in STING-knockout reporter cells, and STING-dependent ISG-inducing activity correlated with disease activity. Double-stranded DNA<ORGANIZATION> levels were elevated in SLE<ORGANIZATION>. Apoptosis-derived membrane vesicles ( AdMVs<ORGANIZATION> ) from SLE<ORGANIZATION> sera had high ISG-inducing activity, which was diminished in cGAS-knockout or STING-knockout reporter cells. AdMVs<ORGANIZATION> in SLE<ORGANIZATION> serum induce IFN-I production through activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Thus, blockade of the cGAS-STING axis represents a promising therapeutic target for SLE<ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, our cell-based reporter system may be useful for stratifying patients with SLE<ORGANIZATION> with high ISG-inducing activity.
