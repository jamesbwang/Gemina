 Left<GPE> ventricular systolic dysfunction ( LVSD<ORGANIZATION> ) and cardiac decompensation often accompany AECOPD<ORGANIZATION>. Differentiation between the two is difficult and mainly relies on clinical and echocardiographic diagnostic procedures. The value of biomarkers, such as NT-proBNP, as diagnostic tools is still insufficiently investigated. The main goals of this trial were to investigate the value of NT-proBNP as a diagnostic tool for LVSD<ORGANIZATION> in AECOPD<GPE> patients and determine its cut-off value which could reliably diagnose LVSD<ORGANIZATION> during AECOPD<ORGANIZATION>. This trial prospectively enrolled 209 patients with AECOPD<ORGANIZATION>. The patients were divided into four groups-AECOPD plus chronic pulmonary heart disease ( CPHD<ORGANIZATION> ) with or without left ventricular compromise ( LVSD<ORGANIZATION> ), and AECOPD<ORGANIZATION> patients without CPHD<ORGANIZATION> with or without LVSD<ORGANIZATION>. NT-proBNP was measured within first 48 h of hospitalization. Majority of patients were male ( 61 % ) active smokers ( 41.6 % ), average age of 68 years. High quality of echocardiography was obtained in 63.3 and 22.5 % of the patients had LVSD<ORGANIZATION>. Average<PERSON> value of NT-proBNP in patients with LVSD<ORGANIZATION> was 3303.2 vs. 1092.5 pg/mL in patients without LVSD<ORGANIZATION>. Significant differences in NT-proBNP value ( p = 0.0001 ) were determined between observed patient groups. At the cut-off value of 1505 pg/mL, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are 76.6, 83.3, 57.1, and 92.47 %, respectively. At the cut-off value of 1505 pg/mL NT-proBNP could be used as a diagnostic marker for LVSD<ORGANIZATION> in acute exacerbation of COPD<ORGANIZATION>.
