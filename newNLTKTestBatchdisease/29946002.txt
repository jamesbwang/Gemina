 Chronic<GPE> mucus hyper-secretion ( CMH<ORGANIZATION> ) contributes to the morbidity and mortality of asthma and remains uncontrolled by current therapies in the subset of patients with severe, steroid resistant disease. Altered cross-talk between airway epithelium and airway smooth muscle cells ( ASMCs<ORGANIZATION> ), driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, provides a potential mechanism that influences CMH.This study investigated mechanisms underlying CMH<ORGANIZATION> by comparing IL-1β-induced gene expression profiles between asthma and control-derived ASMCs<ORGANIZATION> and the subsequent paracrine influence on airway epithelial mucus production
