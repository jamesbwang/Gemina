 The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of oral health related quality of life ( OHRQoL<ORGANIZATION> ) on general health in patients suffering of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ). Ninty-one patients with RA<ORGANIZATION> ( mean age 52.82±11 years, 75.82 % female, 20.87 % smoker ) and 30 systemically healthy patients ( control ) were evaluated for their OHRQoL by means of Geriatric<GPE> Oral Health Assessment Index ( GOHAI<ORGANIZATION> ) and Oral Health Impact<ORGANIZATION> Profile ( OHIP<ORGANIZATION> ) -14 questionnaires. Self-perceived RA status was assessed using the Routine Assessment<ORGANIZATION> of Patient Index<ORGANIZATION> Data 3 ( RAPID<ORGANIZATION> 3 ). Mean SC-GOHAI score was 3.69±2.47 for RA<ORGANIZATION> subjects and 1.36±2.69 in the control group. Statistically significant differences were seen between RA<ORGANIZATION> and control ( p < 0.05 ). RA patients with and without periodontitis ( PA ) exhibited similar SC-GOHAI ( Simple Count<PERSON> GOHAI ) scores ( p=0.980 ). No statistically significant differences were observed between any of the groups neither for the OHIP<ORGANIZATION> 14-extent nor for the OHIP<ORGANIZATION> 14-prevalence. RAPID 3 scores showed that the majority of the RA<ORGANIZATION> patients ( 65.93 % ) had high disease severity ( RAPID<ORGANIZATION> 3 > 12, mean RAPID 3 score 14.39±5.14 ) Statistically significant higher values were recorded for general health assessment ( PTGE<ORGANIZATION>, p=0.009 ) and fatigue ( FT<ORGANIZATION>, p=0.004 ) in RA with PA<ORGANIZATION> as compared to those without. SC-GOHAI with values between 5-8 was statistically significantly associated with high severity health impairment ( RAPID<ORGANIZATION> 3 > 12, p=0.014, OR: 8.64 ). Within their limits, the present findings indicate that: a ) moderate OHRQoL<ORGANIZATION> as assessed by GOHAI<ORGANIZATION> may contribute to the high severity impairment of health in RA patients and b ) the GOHAI<ORGANIZATION> questionnaire may represent a more adequate tool than OHIP-14 for assessing OHRQoL<ORGANIZATION> in patients suffering of RA<ORGANIZATION>. Key words: Oral-health related quality of life, general health, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis.
