 Despite good intentions, humanitarian surgical missions are unavoidably linked to some degree of complication. We hypothesized that the American College<ORGANIZATION> of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator<ORGANIZATION> ( ACS-SRC ) could estimate the risk of complications of procedures performed during the US Navy<ORGANIZATION> 's Pacific Partnership<PERSON> 2015 ( PP15<ORGANIZATION> ) mission. Patient information and surgical details recorded during PP15<ORGANIZATION> were entered into the ACS-SRC. Risks of complications for each procedure were calculated. Receiver operating characteristics and Brier<GPE> scores were calculated to compare the predicted outcomes to the observed complications. Of the 174 unique procedures performed during PP15<ORGANIZATION> ( representing 465 patients ), 99 were found in the ACS-SRC ( representing 256 patients ). Risk calculations for PP15<ORGANIZATION> were: 1.5 % risk ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 0.9, 2.4 ) of `` serious '' complications and 2.0 % risk ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 1.3, 2.8 ) of `` any '' complication. ACS-SRC specific risks were calculated as follows: pneumonia 0.1 %, cardiac 0.0 %, surgical site infection ( SSI<ORGANIZATION> ) 0.6 %, urinary tract infection 0.2 %, venous thromboembolism 0.1 %, renal failure 0.0 %, OR return 0.9 %, and death 0.0 %. The only specific ACS-SRC complication observed was `` OR return '' ( 0.35 % ) and SSI<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.35 % ). The observed PP15<ORGANIZATION> rates for `` serious '' or `` any '' complications ( ACS-SRC definition ) were 0.70 % ( 2/285 ) each. Receiver operating characteristics for ACS-SRC for predicting `` serious '' or `` any '' complication were 0.743 ( p = 0.118 ) and 0.654 ( p = 0.227 ), respectively. Although the ACS-SRC over-predicted risk compared to observed outcomes, it may offer a good starting point for humanitarian surgery risk calculation. Observed outcomes may be limited by loss-to-follow-up bias. Emphasis should be placed on establishing patient follow-up as part of humanitarian surgical mission planning and execution.
