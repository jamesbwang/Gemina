 Prevalence of atopic diseases is progressively increasing in children with unclear clinical picture in oral cavity. This study aimed to find correlation between the total antioxidant and periodontal status in the saliva of periodontally compromised with atopy. The groups consisted of patients of atopic diseases and gingivitis ( ADG<ORGANIZATION> ), of atopic diseases without gingivitis ( AD ), and healthy controls ( HC ). The level of gingival inflammation was evaluated using the sulcus bleeding index ( SBI<ORGANIZATION> ) reported by MÃ¼hlemann<PERSON> and Son<PERSON>. Glutathione ( GSH<ORGANIZATION> ), malondialdehyde ( MDA<ORGANIZATION> ), and superoxide dismutase ( SOD<ORGANIZATION> ) were estimated in saliva. The mean salivary MDA<ORGANIZATION> levels of group HC was significantly lower compared with group ADG<ORGANIZATION> and AD<ORGANIZATION> ( As there was no significant difference in the level of SOD<ORGANIZATION> concentration between groups, we suggest that antioxidant imbalance is primarily explained by atopic disease. The results showed changes in antioxidant balance in children with atopy.
