 Neuropathologic<GPE> evaluation remains the gold standard for determining the presence and severity of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers at U.S.<GPE> Alzheimer 's Disease Centers<ORGANIZATION> ( ADCs<ORGANIZATION> ) have worked for > 30 years studying human brains, with the goals of achieving new research breakthroughs. Harmonization and sharing among the 39 current and past ADCs<ORGANIZATION> is promoted by the National Alzheimer<ORGANIZATION> 's Coordinating Center ( NACC<ORGANIZATION> ), which collects, audits, and disburses ADC-derived data to investigators on request. The past decades have witnessed revised disease definitions paired with dramatic expansion in the granularity and multimodality of the collected data. The NACC<ORGANIZATION> database now includes cognitive test scores, comorbidities, drug history, neuroimaging, and links to genomics. Relatively, recent advances in the neuropathologic diagnoses of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD<ORGANIZATION> ), and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia catalyzed a 2014 update to the NACC Neuropathology Form<ORGANIZATION> completed by all ADCs. New focal points include cerebrovascular disease ( including arteriolosclerosis, microbleeds, and microinfarcts ), hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43, and FTLD<ORGANIZATION>. Here, we provide summary data and analyses to illustrate the potential for both hypothesis-testing and also generating new hypotheses using the NACC Neuropathology<ORGANIZATION> data set, which represents one of the largest multi-center databases of carefully curated neuropathologic information that is freely available to researchers worldwide.
