 Radiosurgical<GPE> treatments of brain tumors, vascular malformations, and functional disorders are more and more frequently used. Gamma Knife<PERSON> irradiation with the Icon<ORGANIZATION> system necessitates the use of a thermoplastic mask for head immobilization during treatment. Acute<PERSON> cutaneous allergy to thermoplastic masks has never been reported. A 71-year-old Caucasian<GPE> woman treated radiosurgically for a sphenoidal meningioma using the Icon Gamma Knife<ORGANIZATION> system developed an acute allergic skin reaction to the thermoplastic mask used for head immobilization. Corticoids<PERSON> and antihistamine drugs were needed to continue the radiosurgical procedure to its end. Allergic reaction of the skin during radiosurgery with a thermoplastic mask for head fixation can develop due to cutaneous contact of the face with the mask.
