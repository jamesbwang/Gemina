 To find out the use of screening and confirmatory tests for diagnosis of multiple myeloma as ordered by clinicians. An Audit. Department of Chemical Pathology<ORGANIZATION> and Endocrinology<GPE>, Armed Forces Institute<PERSON> of Pathology<GPE>, Rawalpindi<GPE>, from January 2012 to January 2017. Data<PERSON> retrieved from Laboratory Information<ORGANIZATION> Management system ( LIMs<ORGANIZATION> ) by selecting serum protein electrophoresis ( SPE<ORGANIZATION> ) as screening test and immunoelectophoresis ( IE ) and immunofixation ( IF ) as confirmatory tests. There were 3,108 tests of serum protein electrophoesis and 1,329 tests of immunoelectophoresis had been performed in last five year. Cost-effective clinical audit of SPE<ORGANIZATION> tests showed that only 17.1 % tests of SPE<ORGANIZATION> were either used for proper diagnosis of multiple myeloma ( totally justified tests 13 % ) or useful for diagnosis of other important diseases whose early diagnosis were helpful for patients management ( partially justified tests 4.1 % ). The cost related to these tests were justified while 82.8 % tests of SPE<ORGANIZATION> were either normal ( total unjustified tests 24.4 % ), or diagnosed irrevalent and nonspecific diseases ( partially unjustified 58.4 % ). IE and IF<ORGANIZATION> audit revealed that only 26.6 % tests were properly utilised for diagnosis and differentiation of multiple myeloma and its subtypes and cost attributable to these tests were justified while 73.4 % of these confirmatory tests were normal and cost related to them was not justified. Overutilisation of laboratory tests for diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be minimised by proper clinical scrutiny of request forms.
