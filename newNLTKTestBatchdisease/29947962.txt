 Inbred<GPE> mouse strains derived from the species Mus<PERSON> spretus have been very informative in the study of certain gene polymorphisms in inflammation and infection. Based on our interest in sepsis, we used SPRET/EiJ mice and mapped several critical loci that are linked to sensitivity to cytokine-induced inflammation and endotoxemia. These studies were based on prominent phenotypes that have never been observed in strains derived from Mus<ORGANIZATION> musculus and we mapped them at a resolution that enables us to draw conclusions on the mechanisms. Now that the genome of SPRET/EiJ has been sequenced, and other tools have become available, it is time to revisit this strain and emphasize its advantages and disadvantages as a research tool and a discovery platform.
