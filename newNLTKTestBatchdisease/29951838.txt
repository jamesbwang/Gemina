 In this review, we summarize the current understanding of microRNA<ORGANIZATION> ( miRNA<ORGANIZATION> ) -mediated modulation of the gene expression in the fatty liver as well as related signaling pathways. Because of the breadth and diversity of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION>, miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> may have a very wide variety of biological functions, and much evidence has confirmed that miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> are involved in the pathogenesis of fatty liver. In the pathophysiological mechanism of fatty liver, miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> may be regulated by upstream regulators, and have their own regulatory targets. miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> display important roles in the pathological mechanisms of alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. At present, most of the miRNA<ORGANIZATION> studies are focused on cell and tissue levels, and in vivo studies will help us elucidate the regulation of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> and help us evaluate the potential of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Furthermore, there is evidence that miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> are involved in the mechanism of natural medicine treatment in fatty liver. Given the important roles of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in the pathogenesis of fatty liver, we predict that studies of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in the pathogenesis of fatty liver will contribute to the elucidation of fatty liver pathology and the treatment of fatty liver patients.
