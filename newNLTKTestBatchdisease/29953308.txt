 To investigate the role of some blood count-derived inflammation biomarkers in age-related macular degeneration ( AMD<ORGANIZATION> ). Seventy-nine men with late-stage AMD<ORGANIZATION> and 79 male age-matched cataract controls without AMD<ORGANIZATION> were recruited in March-December, 2016. A blood sample was taken. The following blood cell count-derived indexes were evaluated: neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio ( NLR<ORGANIZATION> ), derived NLR<ORGANIZATION> [ dNLR = neutrophils/ ( white blood cells ‒ neutrophils ) ], platelet/lymphocyte ratio ( PLR<ORGANIZATION> ), monocyte/lymphocyte ratio ( MLR<ORGANIZATION> ), ( neutrophils × monocytes ) /lymphocyte ratio ( SIRI<ORGANIZATION> ), and ( neutrophils × monocytes × platelets ) /lymphocyte ratio ( AISI<ORGANIZATION> ). AMD<ORGANIZATION> patients had significantly lower median values of white blood cells, monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, and mean platelet volume ( MPV<ORGANIZATION> ). Regarding the combined indexes, only AISI<ORGANIZATION> was significantly lower in AMD<ORGANIZATION> patients than in controls. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the ability of AISI<ORGANIZATION> and MPV<ORGANIZATION> to predict AMD<ORGANIZATION> is poor. Results suggests that NLR<ORGANIZATION>, dNLR<ORGANIZATION>, PLR<ORGANIZATION>, MLR<ORGANIZATION>, SIRI<ORGANIZATION>, and AISI<ORGANIZATION> are unreliable disease biomarkers in men with AMD<ORGANIZATION>. Larger<PERSON> scale studies are necessary to confirm these findings.
