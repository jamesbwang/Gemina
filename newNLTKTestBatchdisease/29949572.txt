 The epidemic tendency of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( HFRS<ORGANIZATION> ) is on the rise in recent years in Guangzhou<GPE>. This study aimed to explore the associations between meteorological factors and HFRS<ORGANIZATION> epidemic risk in Guangzhou<GPE> for the period from 2006-2015. We obtained data of HFRS<ORGANIZATION> cases in Guangzhou<GPE> from the National Notifiable Disease<ORGANIZATION> Report System ( NNDRS<ORGANIZATION> ) during the period of 2006-2015. Meteorological<ORGANIZATION> data were obtained from the Guangzhou Meteorological Bureau<ORGANIZATION>. A negative binomial multivariable regression was used to explore the relationship between meteorological variables and HFRS<ORGANIZATION>. The annual average incidence was 0.92 per 100000, with the annual incidence ranging from 0.64/100000 in 2009 to 1.05/100000 in 2012. The monthly number of HFRS<ORGANIZATION> cases decreased by 5.543 % ( 95 % CI -5.564 % to -5.523 % ) each time the temperature was increased by 1Â°C and the number of cases decreased by 0.075 % ( 95 % CI -0.076 % to -0.074 % ) each time the aggregate rainfall was increased by 1 mm. We found that average temperature with a one-month lag was significantly associated with HFRS<ORGANIZATION> transmission. Meteorological<ORGANIZATION> factors had significant association with occurrence of HFRS<ORGANIZATION> in Guangzhou<GPE>, Southern China<PERSON>. This study provides preliminary information for further studies on epidemiological prediction of HFRS<ORGANIZATION> and for developing an early warning system.
