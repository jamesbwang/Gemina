 Technologies used for genome analysis and whole genome sequencing are useful for us to understand genomic characterization and divergence. The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV<ORGANIZATION> ) is an oncogenic virus that causes diverse diseases such as Burkitt<PERSON> 's lymphoma ( BL ), nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC<ORGANIZATION> ), Hodgkin<PERSON> 's lymphoma ( HL ), and gastric carcinoma ( GC ). EBV<ORGANIZATION> genomes found in these diseases can be classified either by phases of EBV<ORGANIZATION> latency ( type-I, -II, and -III latency ) or types of EBNA2<ORGANIZATION> sequence difference ( type-I EBV<ORGANIZATION>, type-II EBV<ORGANIZATION> or EBV-1, EBV-2 ). EBV from EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line ( LCL<ORGANIZATION> ) establishes type-III latency, EBV<ORGANIZATION> from NPC<ORGANIZATION> establishes type-II latency, and EBV<ORGANIZATION> from GC<ORGANIZATION> establishes type-I latency. However, other important factors play key roles in classifying numerous EBV<ORGANIZATION> strains because EBV<ORGANIZATION> genomes are highly diverse and not phylogenetically related to types of EBV-associated diseases. Herein<PERSON>, we first reviewed previous studies to describe molecular characteristics of EBV<ORGANIZATION> genomes. Then, using comparative and phylogenetic analyses, we phylogenetically analyzed molecular variations of EBV<ORGANIZATION> genomes and proteins. The review of previous studies and our phylogenetic analysis showed that EBV<ORGANIZATION> genomes and proteins were highly diverse regardless of types of EBV-associated diseases. Other factors should be considered in determining EBV<ORGANIZATION> taxonomy. This review will be helpful to understand complicated phylogenetic relationships of EBV<ORGANIZATION> genomes.
