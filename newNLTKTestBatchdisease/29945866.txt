 Many proliferative epithelia are pseudostratified due to cell cycle-dependent interkinetic nuclear migration ( IKNM<ORGANIZATION>, basal during G1 and apical during G2 ). Although most epithelia, including early embryonic neuroepithelia ( ≤100 µm thick ), undergo IKNM<ORGANIZATION> over the entire apicobasal extent, more apicobasally elongated ( 300 µm ) neural progenitor cells ( also called `` radial glia '' ) in the mid-embryonic mouse cerebral wall move their nuclei only within its apical ( 100 µm ) compartment, leaving the remaining basal part nucleus-free ( fiber-like ). How this IKNM range ( i.e., the thickness of a pseudostratified `` ventricular zone '' [ VZ<ORGANIZATION> ] ) is determined remains unknown. Here, we report external fencing of IKNM<ORGANIZATION> and VZ by differentiating cells. When a tight stack of multipolar cells just basal to VZ<ORGANIZATION> was `` drilled '' via acute neuron-directed expression of diphtheria toxin, IKNM<ORGANIZATION> of apicobasally connected progenitor cells continued far basally ( 200 µm ). The unfencing-induced, basally overshot nuclei stay in S phase too long and do not move apically, suggesting that external limitation of IKNM<ORGANIZATION> is necessary for progenitors to undergo normal cytogenetic behaviors. Thus, physical collaboration between progenitors and differentiating cells including neurons underlies brain development.
