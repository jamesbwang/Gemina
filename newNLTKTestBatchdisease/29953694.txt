 Objective screening tool for patients at a high risk of developing acute brain injury ( ABI<ORGANIZATION> ) is necessary for the proper treatment of carbon monoxide ( CO ) poisoning patients. The aim of this study is to identify clinical factors that could predict ABI<ORGANIZATION> due to CO poisoning in patients with an altered mental status. A prospectively collected CO poisoning registry at a single academic medical center was retrospectively analyzed. CO poisoning patients with an altered mental status at the emergency department, defined as unalert on the Alert/responsive to Voice/responsive to Pain/Unresponsive scale, and underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DW-MRI ) between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015, were included. ABI<ORGANIZATION> was defined as the presence of acute hypoxic brain lesions. Clinical<PERSON> predictors of ABI<ORGANIZATION> were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of 180 patients, 67 ( 37.2 % ) had ABI<ORGANIZATION> as revealed by DW-MRI. Multivariate analysis showed that CO<ORGANIZATION> exposure duration > 5 hours ( AOR<ORGANIZATION> [ adjusted odds ratio ], 7.082 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 3.463-15.014 ; P<PERSON> < .001 ) defined as the time between CO exposure and rescue, abnormal WBC<ORGANIZATION> count ( AOR<ORGANIZATION>, 2.568 ; 95 % CI, 1.188-5.700 ; P=.02 ), and abnormal creatinine concentration ( AOR<ORGANIZATION>, 2.667 ; 95 % CI, 1.110-6.605 ; P=.03 ) were predictors of ABI<ORGANIZATION>. CO exposure duration had the highest predictive value ( area under the curve, 0.815 ), and the optimal cutoff value was 5 hours. Moreover, increasing exposure durations ( quartile ) indicated a stepwise increase in the risk of ABI<ORGANIZATION>. In CO poisoning patients with an altered mental status, CO<ORGANIZATION> exposure duration was useful for predicting ABI<ORGANIZATION>, which may help clinicians or paramedics identify high-risk patients and provide treatment on priority.
