 There is a need to rapidly detect patients with traumatic brain injury ( TBI<ORGANIZATION> ) who require head computed tomography ( CT ). Given the energy crisis in the brain following TBI<ORGANIZATION>, we hypothesized that serum metabolomics would be a useful tool for developing a set of biomarkers to determine the need for CT<ORGANIZATION> and to distinguish between different types of injuries observed. Logistic regression models using metabolite data from the discovery cohort ( n=144, Turku<GPE>, Finland<GPE> ) were used to distinguish between patients with traumatic intracranial findings and negative findings on head CT. The resultant models were then tested in the validation cohort ( n=66, Cambridge<GPE>, UK<ORGANIZATION> ). The levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 were also quantified in the serum from the same patients. Despite there being significant differences in the protein biomarkers in patients with TBI<ORGANIZATION>, the model that determined the need for a CT scan validated poorly ( AUC=0.64: Cambridge patients ). However, using a combination of six metabolites ( two amino acids, three sugar derivatives and one ketoacid ) it was possible to discriminate patients with intracranial abnormalities on CT and patients with a normal CT ( AUC=0.77 in Turku<GPE> patients and AUC=0.73 in Cambridge<GPE> patients ). Furthermore, a combination of three metabolites could distinguish between diffuse brain injuries and mass lesions ( AUC=0.87 in Turku<GPE> patients and AUC=0.68 in Cambridge<GPE> patients ). This study identifies a set of validated serum polar metabolites, which associate with the need for a CT scan. Additionally, serum metabolites can also predict the nature of the brain injury. These metabolite markers may prevent unnecessary CT scans, thus reducing the cost of diagnostics and radiation load.
