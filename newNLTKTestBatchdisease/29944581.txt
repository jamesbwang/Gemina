 Perianal fistulizing Crohn<PERSON> 's disease is a challenging clinical situation that requires proper management. Some features seen on the endoanal ultrasound can be helpful in discriminating between cryptoglandular and Crohn<PERSON> 's disease fistulas. The aim of this study was to define the diagnostic accuracy of 3-dimensional endoanal ultrasound in differentiating between Crohn<PERSON> 's disease and cryptogenic fistulas. This was a prospective observational study. The study was conducted in the colorectal unit of an IBD<ORGANIZATION> referral center. Consecutive patients referred for suspected perianal sepsis from September 2015 to December 2016 were included. Three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonography was the studied intervention. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 4 ultrasonographic features ( Crohn<PERSON> 's ultrasound fistula sign, the presence of a double track, debris or an abscess within the fistula track, and the maximum width of the track ) in discriminating between cryptoglandular and Crohn<PERSON> 's disease fistulas were calculated. The interobserver agreement for each feature was quantified. In this study, 158 patients, of whom 33 had a diagnosis of Crohn<GPE> 's disease, were included. The interobserver agreement was good for all of the ultrasonographic features. All of these features were more frequent in cases of Crohn<GPE> 's disease fistulas ( p = 0.0001 ). The maximum width of the fistula track was highly accurate for discriminating between cryptogenic and Crohn<PERSON> 's disease fistulas ( area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.922 ). The simultaneous presence of 2 features was suggestive of Crohn<GPE> 's disease fistula. In particular, the presence of a track width > 4 mm in conjunction with either a double track or the Crohn<GPE> 's ultrasound fistula sign showed very high specificity ( 1.00 ). Conversely, a fistula track width â‰¤3 mm had high sensitivity ( 0.97 ). Patients<PERSON> included in the cryptogenic group might be diagnosed as having Crohn<PERSON> 's disease at follow-up. The combination of specific endoanal ultrasonographic features allows for highly accurate discrimination between Crohn<PERSON> 's disease and cryptogenic fistulas.
