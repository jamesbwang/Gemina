 Primary headaches, such as migraine and cluster headache, are one of the most common and disabling neurological diseases worldwide. Neuroimaging studies have changed the way we understand these diseases and have enriched our knowledge of the mechanisms of actions of currently available therapies. The present review highlights the major findings reported in migraine and cluster headache neuroimaging over the last year. Widespread structural and functional abnormalities in cortical and subcortical areas involved in multisensory, including pain, processing have been shown in migraine and cluster headache patients during different phases of the disease. Beyond the involvement of single brain areas, dysfunctional brain networks contribute to their pathophysiology. New central mechanisms of action of headache preventive treatments have also been explored. A better understanding of migraine and cluster headache biology has paved the way for the development of new improved treatments for both these conditions. Although significant advances have been made over the last year, there are still many unsolved questions to address.
