 Hysterectomy<GPE> is the second most common surgery performed for mainly benign uterine pathologies in females. The association between hysterectomy and the subsequent risk of hypertension remains controversial. This study investigated the risk of developing hypertension in women who had a hysterectomy. Population-based retrospective cohort study. We used the Taiwan<GPE> National Health Insurance Research Database with claims data of 1 million randomly selected insured individuals. Women with and without hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, aged 30-49 years, identified in 2000-2013 from the insurance data. From the claims data, we identified 6674 women with hysterectomy without hypertension at the time of the surgery. The comparison cohort were 26,696 women randomly selected from women without hysterectomy and hypertension, matched by age and the year with hysterectomy was performed. Adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR<ORGANIZATION> ) of hypertension was estimated after controlling for co-morbidities. Prediction for hypertension following hysterectomy for benign disease. Both cohorts had a median age of 43.9 years. After a median follow-up of 6.4 years, the incident hypertension was higher in the hysterectomy cohort than in the comparison cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio [ aHR ] of 1.35 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.27-1.44 ). The incidence increased with age, with an aHR greater in hysterectomised women aged 40-49 years ( aHR= 1.37, 95 % CI= 1.06-1.83 ) than in those aged 30-39 years ( aHR 1.22, 95 % CI= 1.02-1.46 ). Findings in this study suggests that women with hysterectomy are more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension in the follow-up period. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
