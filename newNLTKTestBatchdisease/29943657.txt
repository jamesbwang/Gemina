 To define the incidence and risk factors associated with rectourethral fistula ( RUF<ORGANIZATION> ) formation following primary whole-gland cryosurgery using a multicenter, centralized registry. The Cryo<ORGANIZATION> On-Line Data ( COLD<ORGANIZATION> ) registry was queried for men undergoing primary whole-gland cryotherapy between 1990 and 2014 who developed a RUF<ORGANIZATION>. Patient factors and disease parameters were correlated with RUF<ORGANIZATION> using Chi-square test and the t-test. Variables with P<PERSON> < 0.25 were entered into a binary logistic regression with stepwise backward elimination to determine the factors associated with RUF<ORGANIZATION> formation. A total of 4,102 men underwent primary whole-gland cryotherapy, in the COLD<ORGANIZATION> registry at the time of analysis. Postoperative RUF<ORGANIZATION> was documented in 50 out of 4102 cases ( 1.21 % ). Patients with RUF<ORGANIZATION> had similar demographic data, prostate volume, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level and clinical stage in comparison to those without fistula. On both univariate and multivariate analyses, postoperative urinary retention ( OR: 6.30 ; 95 % CI 3.43-11.58, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), preoperative Gleason<PERSON> score of â‰¥7 ( OR: 1.92 ; 95 % CI 1.08-3.43, P=0.027 ) and preoperative incontinence ( OR: 2.95, 95 % CI 1.12-7.76, P=0.028 ) were the most signifiant risk factors associated with RUF<ORGANIZATION> formation. Primary whole-gland cryotherapy for prostate cancer is associated with a historically low rate ( 1.21 % ) of postoperative RUF<ORGANIZATION> formation. The rate decreased further to 0.55 % over the last several years, suggesting better patient selection and technical improvement. Postoperative urinary retention, Gleason<PERSON> score > 7 and preoperative urinary incontinence were the key demographic, clinical and pathological features associated with RUF<ORGANIZATION> formation in this study.
