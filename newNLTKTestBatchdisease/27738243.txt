 Lysophospholipid<GPE> signaling is emerging as a druggable regulator of pathophysiological responses, and especially fibrosis, exemplified by the relative ongoing clinical trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. In this review, we focus on ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase-phosphodiesterase 2 ( ENPP2<ORGANIZATION> ), or as more widely known Autotaxin<GPE> ( ATX<ORGANIZATION> ), a secreted lysophospholipase D ( lysoPLD<ORGANIZATION> ) largely responsible for extracellular lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA<ORGANIZATION> ) production. In turn, LPA<ORGANIZATION> is a bioactive phospholipid autacoid, forming locally upon increased ATX<ORGANIZATION> levels and acting also locally through its receptors, likely guided by ATX<ORGANIZATION> 's structural conformation and cell surface associations. Increased ATX<ORGANIZATION> activity levels have been detected in many inflammatory and fibroproliferative conditions, while genetic and pharmacologic studies have confirmed a pleiotropic participation of ATX/LPA in different processes and disorders. In pulmonary fibrosis, ATX<ORGANIZATION> levels rise in the broncheoalveolar fluid ( BALF<ORGANIZATION> ) and stimulate LPA<ORGANIZATION> production. LPA<ORGANIZATION> engagement of its receptors activate multiple G-protein mediated signal transduction pathways leading to different responses from pulmonary cells including the production of pro-inflammatory signals from stressed epithelial cells, the modulation of endothelial physiology, the activation of TGF<ORGANIZATION> signaling and the stimulation of fibroblast accumulation. Genetic or pharmacologic targeting of the ATX/LPA axis attenuated disease development in animal models, thus providing the proof of principle for therapeutic interventions.
