 Histoplasmosis involving mediastinum is very rare which can present as a mediastinal mass or fibrosing mediastinitis. Fibrosing mediastinitis can be life-threatening if left untreated due to the involvement of the surrounding visceral and vascular structures. We present an interesting case of fibrosing mediastinitis due to histoplasmosis presented with palpitations, chest pain and dyspnea. The patient had mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with calcification on chest imaging. The patient was diagnosed on lymph node biopsy and treated with antifungals.
