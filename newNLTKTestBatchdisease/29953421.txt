 Persistent hepatitis E virus genotype 3 ( HEV G3<ORGANIZATION> ) infections affect solid organ transplant ( SOT<ORGANIZATION> ) recipients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT<ORGANIZATION> ) recipients, but the burden in these cohorts in the United Kingdom<ORGANIZATION> is unknown. We established an audit to determine the point prevalence of HEV<ORGANIZATION> viremia in SOT<ORGANIZATION> and HSCT<ORGANIZATION> patients in the United Kingdom<ORGANIZATION> and compare different testing approaches to inform screening strategies. Between<PERSON> January 5, 2016, and September 21, 2016, 3044 patients undergoing therapeutic drug monitoring at a single transplant center were screened for HEV<ORGANIZATION> ribonucleic acid ( RNA<ORGANIZATION> ) in minipools. A total of 2822 patients who could be characterized included 2419 SOT patients, 144 HSCT<ORGANIZATION> patients and 259 patients with no available transplant history. HEV<ORGANIZATION> RNA-positive samples were characterized by serology and genomic phylogeny. HEV<ORGANIZATION> antigen ( HEV-Ag ) testing was performed on RNA-positive samples, 420 RNA-negative samples and 176 RNA-negative blood donor samples. Nineteen of 2822 patients were viremic with G3 HEV<PERSON> giving a prevalence of 0.67 %. The median alanine aminotransferase was significantly higher in the HEV<ORGANIZATION> viremic patients ( P<PERSON> < 0.0001 ) ; however, 2 viremic patients had an alanine aminotransferase value within the normal range at the time of screening. The HEV-Ag assay identified 18/19 viremic patients and all those patients with proven viremia longer than 4 weeks. Transplant recipients in the United Kingdom<ORGANIZATION> are at a low but significant risk of HEV<ORGANIZATION> infection. HEV-Ag detection could be an alternative to RNA<ORGANIZATION> detection where the goal is to identify established persistent HEV<ORGANIZATION> infection, particularly where expertise, facilities, or cost prohibit RNA<ORGANIZATION> testing.
