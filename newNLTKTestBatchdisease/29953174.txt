 The objective of the study is to determine the usefulness of the SOFA<ORGANIZATION> ( Sequential Organ Failure Assessment<ORGANIZATION> ), quick SOFA<ORGANIZATION> ( qSOFA<ORGANIZATION> ), LODS<ORGANIZATION> ( Logistic Organ Dysfunction System<ORGANIZATION> ) and EWS<ORGANIZATION> ( Early Warning Score<ORGANIZATION> ) scores to predict in-hospital mortality among septic patients attended in the emergency department ; to evaluate what factors are associated with mortality ; and develop a predictive model of in-hospital mortality. Retrospective study including patients over 14 years of age included in the sepsis code of an Emergency Department<ORGANIZATION> of a University Hospital<ORGANIZATION> between November 2013 and September 2015. Demographic variables, hemodynamic and analytical variables, and in-hospital mortality were collected to obtain qSOFA<ORGANIZATION>, SOFA<ORGANIZATION>, LODS<ORGANIZATION>, EWS<ORGANIZATION> scores. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each score. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the probability of in-hospital mortality. A total of 349 patients were analyzed, median age 72.7 ( range 86 ), males: 54.4 %. The in-hospital mortality was 21.8 %. AUC<ORGANIZATION> obtained: LODS: 0.73 ( IC<ORGANIZATION> 95 % 0.67-0.80 ; p < 0.001 ), EWS<ORGANIZATION>: 0.73 ( IC<ORGANIZATION> 95 % 0.65-0.81 ; p < 0.001 ), SOFA<ORGANIZATION>: 0.72 ( IC<ORGANIZATION> 95 % 0.65- 0.78 ; p < 0.001 ), qSOFA<ORGANIZATION>: 0.67 ( IC<ORGANIZATION> 95 % 0.58-0.76 ; p < 0.001 ). After the multivariate analysis, these were the independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality: Oxygen saturation ≤92 %, Glasgow<GPE> coma score < 14, lactate ≥2mmol/L ( p < 0.05 ). Two prognostic models were generated: MPRO1: age, oxygen saturation ≤92 % and Glasgow<GPE> coma score < 14, AUC<ORGANIZATION>: 0.78 ( IC<ORGANIZATION> 95 % 0.72-0.84 ; p < 0.001 ) and MPRO2<ORGANIZATION> formed by the previous ones and lactate ≥2mmol/L, AUC<ORGANIZATION>: 0.82 ( IC<ORGANIZATION> 95 % 0.76-0.87 ; p < 0.001 ). SOFA<ORGANIZATION> score and the new developed scores could be useful in asses the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients included in the sepsis code.
