 Pyoderma<GPE> gangrenosum ( PG ) is a rare neutrophil-mediated autoinflammatory dermatosis that can involve the oral mucosa. Dental<PERSON> surgery is a potential triggering factor for the onset of PG<ORGANIZATION> lesions. The authors describe and discuss the dental management of a rare case of aggressive periodontitis in a patient with PG<ORGANIZATION>, from multiple tooth extractions to prosthetic rehabilitation, including administration of systemic steroid prophylaxis before surgery to prevent the potential onset of PG-related lesions. A 22-year-old man who had a diagnosis of PG<ORGANIZATION> and who had aggressive periodontal disease underwent dental extractions, gingivoplastic surgery, and prosthetic rehabilitation. The patient received 8 milligrams of betamethasone intramuscularly 20 minutes before the oral surgery. The tissues healed perfectly, and no adverse effects were reported. For minor oral surgery, prophylactic corticosteroids might help reduce the risk of developing PG-related lesions. The clinician should plan the prosthetic devices to be as atraumatic as possible.
