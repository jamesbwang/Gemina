 Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease of central nervous system ( CNS<ORGANIZATION> ). Nowadays, increasing evidence suggests that immune system plays a significant role in the mechanisms of AD<ORGANIZATION> 's onset and progression. Microglia<PERSON>, the main participator in the immune system of CNS<ORGANIZATION>, is always regarded as a protector of our brain in a healthy state and also has a beneficial role in maintaining the homeostasis of CNS<ORGANIZATION> microenvironment. However, chronic and sustained stimulation can push microglia into the state termed priming. Primed microglia can induce the production of amyloid β ( Aβ ), tau pathology, neuroinflammation and reduce the release of neurotrophic factors, resulting in loss of normal neurons in quantity and function that has immense relationship with AD<ORGANIZATION>. The therapeutic strategies mainly aimed at modulating the microenvironment and microglial activity in CNS<ORGANIZATION> to delay progression and alleviate pathogenesis of AD<ORGANIZATION>. Overall, in this review, we highlight the mechanism of microglial priming, and discuss the profound relationship between microglial priming and AD<ORGANIZATION>. Besides, we also pay attention to the therapeutic strategies targeting at microglial priming.
