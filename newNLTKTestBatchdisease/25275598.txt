 Prostate<GPE> cancer ( PCa<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the most prevalent male cancers in western world. Radiation therapy ( RT ) is commonly used to treat PCa<ORGANIZATION> patients. However, a certain proportion of patients develop radioresistant PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells, which results in metastatic disease. Statins<PERSON>, which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase, are commonly used to treat hypercholesterolemia, exhibiting beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases and on several types of cancers, including PCa<ORGANIZATION>. However, the mechanistic details and crosstalk between statins and RT in PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells remain unknown. In this study, radioresistant DOC-2/DAB2 interactive protein ( DAB2IP<ORGANIZATION> ) -deficient PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells were used to evaluate whether simvastatin could enhance the effect of ionizing radiation ( IR ). The crucial molecules that associated with simvastatin elevated radiosensitivity in PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells were explored. Our results demonstrated that a combination treatment with simvastatin and IR<ORGANIZATION> synergistically induced apoptosis of radioresistant PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells. In addition, simvastatin appeared to compromise DNA<ORGANIZATION> double-strand breaks repair by activating the expressions of histone 2A family member X ( Î³-H2AX ) and phospho-checkpoint kinase 1 ( p-CHK1 ), suggesting an underlying mechanism for this radiosensitization of PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells. These findings reveal that simvastatin may be a potent therapeutic agent for co-treatment with radiation to overcome radioresistance in PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells.
