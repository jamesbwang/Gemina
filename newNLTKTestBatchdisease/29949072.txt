 Behavioral testing in perceptual or cognitive domains requires querying a subject multiple times in order to quantify his or her ability in the corresponding domain. These queries must be conducted sequentially, and any additional testing domains are also typically tested sequentially, such as with distinct tests comprising a test battery. As a result, existing behavioral tests are often lengthy and do not offer comprehensive evaluation. The use of active machine-learning kernel methods for behavioral assessment provides extremely flexible yet efficient estimation tools to more thoroughly investigate perceptual or cognitive processes without incurring the penalty of excessive testing time. Audiometry<ORGANIZATION> represents perhaps the simplest test case to demonstrate the utility of these techniques. In pure-tone audiometry, hearing is assessed in the two-dimensional input space of frequency and intensity, and the test is repeated for both ears. Although an individual 's ears are not linked physiologically, they share many features in common that lead to correlations suitable for exploitation in testing. The bilateral audiogram estimates hearing thresholds in both ears simultaneously by conjoining their separate input domains into a single search space, which can be evaluated efficiently with modern machine-learning methods. The result is the introduction of the first conjoint psychometric function estimation procedure, which consistently delivers accurate results in significantly less time than sequential disjoint estimators.
