 Patient mortality rates have remained stubbornly high ( 40 % ) for the past 35 years in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC<ORGANIZATION> ) due to inherent or acquired drug resistance. Thus, a critical issue in advanced SCC<ORGANIZATION> is to identify and target the mechanisms that contribute to therapy resistance. We report that the transcriptional inhibitor, E2F7<PERSON>, is mislocalized to the cytoplasm in > 80 % of human HNSCCs<ORGANIZATION>, whereas the transcriptional activator, E2F1<PERSON>, retains localization to the nucleus in SCC<ORGANIZATION>. This results in an imbalance in the control of E2F-dependent targets such as
