 There is growing attention for antimicrobial stewardship in paediatrics. Currently<PERSON>, little is known about secondary care antibiotic practice. We analysed trends in time with respect to inpatient antibiotic use in a secondary paediatric care setting. Total inpatient antibiotic consumption per year ( 2010-2015 ) and antibiotic prescriptions for urinary tract infection ( UTI<ORGANIZATION> ) and lower respiratory tract infection ( LRTI<ORGANIZATION> ) were analysed. Variables were total, antibiotic-specific, and intravenous days of therapy ( DOT/100PD ) and for UTI/LRTI treatment type, route and duration. Third-generation cephalosporin use decreased ( DOT/100PD 11.6 in 2011 vs. 5.1 in 2015 ; p < 0.001 ) ; intravenous antibiotics were prescribed less often ( p = 0.06 ). These findings were confirmed for the specific diseases: third-generation cephalosporin use decreased for both UTI ( 93 % vs. 45 % ; p = 0.002 ) and LRTI<ORGANIZATION> ( 14 % vs. 6 % ; p = 0.18 ) ; the duration of intravenous therapy decreased ( UTI<ORGANIZATION> p = 0.02 ; LRTI<ORGANIZATION> p < 0.001 ). Median<PERSON> LRTI<ORGANIZATION> treatment duration was 9.2 days in 2008 and 6.6 in 2015 ( p < 0.001 ) ; penicillin prescriptions were more narrow in spectrum ( p = 0.02 ). A decrease in third-generation cephalosporin use and intravenous route was identified. LRTI<ORGANIZATION> treatment was significantly shorter and more narrow in spectrum. This could be explained by awareness and interventions in the context of antimicrobial stewardship. A decrease in antibiotic use is also feasible and important in non-tertiary paediatric wards. What is Known: • Antimicrobial stewardship programmes are effective in reduction of total and broad-spectrum antibiotic use in tertiary paediatric hospitals • The majority of hospitalised paediatric patients are admitted at general, secondary care wards, often for infectious diseases What is New<GPE>: • Antimicrobial stewardship interventions in secondary care are also effective in establishing a reduction in broad-spectrum antibiotic use, intravenous route and days on antibiotic therapy.
