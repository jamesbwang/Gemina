 Colorectal<GPE> cancer ( CRC<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and new treatment strategies for CRC<ORGANIZATION> are required because of the existing chemotherapy resistance. Iron chelators, which have been used widely for the treatment of iron-overload disease, were reported to exert anti-proliferative effects in cancer. However, the role of iron chelation in CRC<ORGANIZATION> was largely unknown. In this study, we found that the iron chelator DFO<ORGANIZATION> inhibited CRC<ORGANIZATION> cell growth significantly. In addition, the gene expression profile was greatly changed by DFO<ORGANIZATION> treatment, and many cell growth-related genes were dysregulated. Further study showed that DFO<ORGANIZATION> induced a significant increase in global histone methylation in CRC<ORGANIZATION> cells. However, the levels of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases did not change in response to DFO<ORGANIZATION> treatment, implying that the enzymatic activity of these enzymes might be regulated by iron chelation. In conclusion, this study reveals a novel role for DFO<ORGANIZATION> in CRC<ORGANIZATION> cell growth, and is the first to demonstrate that global histone methylation is modulated by iron chelation in CRC<ORGANIZATION> cells.
