 Whether an individually determined appropriate level of cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) has a favorable effect on the renal function still remains unclarified. The aim of this study was to confirm the effect of CR<ORGANIZATION> on the estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) using cystatin C, which is known to be unaffected by physical exercise. The study population was comprised of 86 patients ( 61 males ; average age 74 y/o ) with a lower-moderate level of chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ) who was admitted to our hospital for treatment of cardiovascular disease ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ) and who participated in our 3-month CR program. The exercise capacity was assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPX<ORGANIZATION> ) and the eGFR<ORGANIZATION> was measured by a formula based on the serum cystatin C concentration ( eGFRcys<ORGANIZATION> ) in each patient both at the beginning and end of the CR<ORGANIZATION>. In the CVD<ORGANIZATION> patients with CKD<ORGANIZATION>, both the peak oxygen uptake ( VO In CVD<ORGANIZATION> patients, a novel CR program significantly improved the exercise capacity. Further<PERSON>, CR<ORGANIZATION> was shown to have a favorable effect on the renal function when it was estimated by the eGFRcys<ORGANIZATION>.
