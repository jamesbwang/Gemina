 Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD<ORGANIZATION> ) is the second most common presenile dementia characterized by behavioral changes and language impairment. The diagnosis of FTD<ORGANIZATION> relies heavily on neuroimaging, and sometimes on genetic screening. However, the genetic components in Chinese<GPE> FTD<ORGANIZATION> patients remain largely unknown. Only a few FTD<ORGANIZATION> cases with established mutations have been reported in China<GPE>. This study reported the detailed clinical and neuroimaging features in a Chinese<GPE> behavioral variant FTD<ORGANIZATION> family. The role of By detailed inquiry of all affected individuals in the family, this study summarized the main clinical features of the disease. Four candidate genes ( By direct sequencing of candidate genes ( For the inherited FTD<ORGANIZATION> patients, ASL-MRI and genetic identification were strongly recommended for the final diagnosis. In case of being underestimated, the role of
