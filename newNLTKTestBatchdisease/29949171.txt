 Osteoporosis<GPE> is the most common bone metabolic disease. Exosome<PERSON> exerts a crucial role in the development of multiple diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of exosome derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) in osteoporosis and its underlying mechanism. MSCs were first isolated from rat bone marrow. After the surface antigen of MSCs<ORGANIZATION> was identified by flow cytometry, MSCs-derived exosomes ( MSC-Exo ) was extracted. The osteogenic and lipid differentiation abilities of BMSCs<ORGANIZATION> were determined by alizarin red staining and oil red staining, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) was used to detect the mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expressions of genes. Cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay was used to detect the viability of hFOB<ORGANIZATION> 1.19 cells. Western blot was used to measure expressions of the specific surface markers in exosomes and the MAPK<ORGANIZATION> pathway-related proteins in hFOB 1.19 cells. Moreover, cell cycle of hFOB<ORGANIZATION> 1.19 was detected by flow cytometry. We observed a positive identification of surface antigens in MSCs<GPE>, which presented good multidirectional differentiation ability. The isolated MSC-Exo exhibited typical morphology and particle size of exosomes, and the detection of specific surface labeled protein was positive under an electron microscope. After co-culture of MSC-Exo and osteoblast cell line hFOB 1.19, we found that MSC-Exo could promote the proliferation of hFOB<ORGANIZATION> 1.19 cells. Moreover, mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein expressions of GLUT3<ORGANIZATION> in cells were increased, and the cell cycle was also promoted. The expressions of related proteins in the MAPK<ORGANIZATION> signaling pathway were found to be promoted. Rescue experiments demonstrated that MSC-Exo could promote the growth and cell cycle of hFOB 1.19<ORGANIZATION>, which were reversed by p-JNK knockdown. MSC-derived exosomes improve osteoporosis by promoting the proliferation of osteoblasts via MAPK<ORGANIZATION> pathway.
