 The recent Zika virus ( ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> ) epidemic swept across Latin America<PERSON> and the Caribbean<LOCATION>, where dengue virus ( DENV<ORGANIZATION> ) is endemic. The antigenic similarities of these closely related flaviviruses left researchers and clinicians with challenges to interpret serological tests. Thirty-six women attending a prenatal clinic in Honduras<GPE> and with positive DENV<ORGANIZATION> IgM enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays ( ELISAs<ORGANIZATION> ) were screened with a ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> IgM ELISA, RT-PCR for ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> and DENV<ORGANIZATION> 1-4, and plaque reduction neutralization tests ( PRNTs<ORGANIZATION> ) for ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> and DENV-2. Plaque<PERSON> reduction neutralization test results were interpreted using the World<ORGANIZATION> Health Organization ( WHO<ORGANIZATION> ) and Centers<ORGANIZATION> for Disease Control<PERSON> and Prevention ( CDC<ORGANIZATION> ) criteria. Using the WHO<ORGANIZATION> criteria of a PRNT90<ORGANIZATION> titer â‰¥ 20 and a 4-fold difference between ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> and DENV<ORGANIZATION> titers, we determined that 69.4 % of samples had a recent ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> infection, compared with 5.6 % using CDC<ORGANIZATION> criteria. The interpretation of ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> PRNTs in a DENV-endemic region is highly dependent on the choice of interpretation criteria.
