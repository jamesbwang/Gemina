 Mannitol<GPE>, an osmotic diuretic, has been used to prevent acute kidney injury ( AKI<ORGANIZATION> ). However, studies have found divergent effects of intraoperative mannitol administration on postoperative AKI<ORGANIZATION>. We therefore evaluated the effects of intraoperative mannitol administration on AKI<ORGANIZATION> after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RALP<ORGANIZATION> ) in prostate cancer patients.A total of 864 patients who underwent RALP<ORGANIZATION> were divided into mannitol ( administered at 0.5 g/kg ) and no-mannitol groups. Demographics, cancer-related data, preoperative laboratory values, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes such as AKI<ORGANIZATION>, chronic kidney disease at 12 months postoperation, duration of hospital stay, and intensive care unit admission rate and duration of stay were compared between the 2 groups using propensity score matching analysis. To determine the risk factors for AKI<ORGANIZATION> after RALP<ORGANIZATION>, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Postoperative AKI<ORGANIZATION> was defined according to the Kidney<ORGANIZATION> Disease: Improving Global Outcomes<PERSON> criteria.After performing 1:1 propensity score matching, the mannitol and no-mannitol groups included 234 patients each. The overall incidence of AKI<ORGANIZATION> after RALP<ORGANIZATION> was 5.1 % and was not significantly different between the no-mannitol and mannitol groups in the propensity score-matched patients ( 13 [ 5.6 % ] vs. 11 [ 4.7 % ], P<PERSON> = .832 ). Univariate<ORGANIZATION> logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index and operative time were associated with AKI<ORGANIZATION> in 864 patients who underwent RALP<ORGANIZATION>. However, intraoperative mannitol administration was not associated with AKI<ORGANIZATION> after RALP<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> = .284 ). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that operative time was significantly associated with AKI<ORGANIZATION> after RALP<ORGANIZATION> ( odds ratio = 1.013, P<PERSON> = .001 ). The incidence of chronic kidney disease ( 13 [ 5.6 % ] vs. 12 [ 5.1 % ], P<PERSON> = 1.000 ) and other postoperative outcomes were not also significantly different between the no-mannitol and mannitol groups in the propensity score-matched patients.Intraoperative mannitol administration has no beneficial effect on the prevention of AKI<ORGANIZATION> after RALP<ORGANIZATION> in prostate cancer patients. This result provides useful information for clinical practice guidelines regarding intraoperative mannitol use.
