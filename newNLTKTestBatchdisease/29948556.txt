 Acute<GPE> severe colitis ( ASC<ORGANIZATION> ) is conventionally diagnosed by Truelove<PERSON> and Witts<PERSON> ' criteria which are non-specific and can be affected by other pathologic conditions. Fecal<PERSON> calprotectin ( FCP<ORGANIZATION> ) is a gut-specific marker of inflammation which can predict short-term outcomes in patients with ASC<ORGANIZATION>. We aimed to define the role of FCP<ORGANIZATION> in the diagnosis of ASC<ORGANIZATION>. This prospective observational cohort study included adult patients ( > 18 years ) with ulcerative colitis ( UC ) for whom FCP<ORGANIZATION> was measured and was under follow-up from April 2015 to December 2016. Patients were divided into two cohorts: ( 1 ) all consecutive hospitalized patients with ASC<ORGANIZATION> as defined by Truelove<PERSON> and Witts<PERSON> ' criteria ; ( 2 ) outpatients with active UC ( defined by Mayo<PERSON> score ) who did not fulfill Truelove<PERSON> and Witts<PERSON> ' criteria. FCP levels were compared between the two cohorts, and a cutoff for FCP<ORGANIZATION> to diagnose ASC<ORGANIZATION> was determined. Of 97 patients, 49 were diagnosed with ASC<ORGANIZATION> ( mean age: 36.1 ± 11.9 years, 36 males ) and 48 with active UC ( mean age: 37.9 ± 12.4 years, 25 males ). Median FCP<PERSON> levels were significantly higher in patients with ASC<ORGANIZATION> [ 1776 ( 952-3123 ) vs 282 ( 43-568 ) µg/g, p < 0.001 ] than mild to moderately active UC ( n = 48 ) or moderately active UC [ n = 35, 1776 ( 952-3123 ) vs 332 ( 106-700 ) µg/g, p < 0.001 ]. A FCP cutoff of 782 μg/g of stool had excellent diagnostic accuracy, with an area under the curve of 0.92 ( 95 % CI 0.87-0.97 ), sensitivity of 84 % and specificity of 88 % to differentiate ASC<ORGANIZATION> from active UC. FCP<ORGANIZATION> could differentiate ASC<ORGANIZATION> from mild to moderate patients with UC<ORGANIZATION>, but requires validation before clinical use.
