 Adenocarcinoma<GPE> is the commonest histologic subtype of lung cancer and is often identified by immunohistochemical staining for thyroid transcription factor-1 ( TTF-1 ). However, up to 20 % of lung adenocarcinomas do not express TTF-1, and there is uncertainty regarding the significance of this. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic effect of TTF-1 expression status on survival in patients treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung. This retrospective study included patients treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma, who had known TTF-1 expression status. Clinical<PERSON> and demographic data were obtained from medical records. Overall survival ( OS ) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences in survival between groups assessed using the Cox<ORGANIZATION> proportional hazards model. Forty-four patients were identified with documented TTF-1 expression: 35 with TTF-1-positive and 9 with TTF-1-negative disease. Patients in the TTF-1-negative group had poorer performance scores than those in the TTF-1-positive group ( ECOG<ORGANIZATION> 2: 67 vs 20 %, p = 0.008 ), and received less chemotherapy ( median cycles 2 vs 4, p = 0.009 ), and were fewer in treatment with doublet regimens ( 22 vs 69 %, p = 0.013 ). OS was significantly shorter in the TTF-1-negative group than in the TTF-1-positive group ( 2.4 vs 11.5 months, HR 8.38, p < 0.0001 ). In this group of patients treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma, absence of TTF-1 expression was associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype, poorer performance status, and poor survival. This subgroup of patients should be recognized as having a distinct clinical course, with limited benefit from standard chemotherapy.
