 The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of two doses of photobiomodulation ( PBM<ORGANIZATION> ) on inflammatory parameters including cell migration and oxidative stress in carrageenan-induced peritonitis models. Twenty-eight mice were divided into four groups: saline ; untreated carrageenan ( Cg<GPE> ; inflammation induced ) ; and PMB<ORGANIZATION> treatment groups L1 and L5<GPE> ( inflammation induced with carrageenan followed by laser irradiation at 1 and 5 J/cm
