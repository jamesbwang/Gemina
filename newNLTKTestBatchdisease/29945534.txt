 Background Patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic solitary fibrous tumour are often treated with bevacizumab and temozolomide based on the clinical efficacy reported in a case series of 14 patients. Given the rarity of solitary fibrous tumour, large trials are not feasible. We report the efficacy of this regimen based on a population-based analysis. Methods This was a population-based retrospective, multi-centre analysis using patient data from a provincial cancer registry and treatment database. Cases from June 2006 through October 2016 were identified for patients receiving bevacizumab and temozolomide for locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic solitary fibrous tumour or hemangiopericytoma, which is sometimes used to describe tumours arising from the meninges. The primary outcome was overall response rate. Secondary outcomes included time to response, progression free survival and overall survival estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Fourteen patients were identified: median age 59 ( range 44-70 ), male 78.6 %. Diagnoses were solitary fibrous tumour in 10 ( 71.4 % ) and hemangiopericytoma in four ( 28.6 % ), with metastatic disease in 10 ( 72.7 % ) patients. The most common primary sites were meninges in four ( 28.6 % ) and pelvis in three ( 21.4 % ) patients. The median follow-up was 15.5 months, with median treatment of four months. Overall response rate was 21.4 % ( no complete response, 3 partial response ), with median time to response of four months. Median<GPE> progression free survival, six-month progression free survival and overall survival were 17 months, 65.0 %, and 45 months, respectively. Conclusions Efficacy of bevacizumab and temozolomide in solitary fibrous tumour appeared to be similar to that previously reported. Our findings confirmed that bevacizumab and temozolomide is an effective and tolerated treatment for this patient population.
