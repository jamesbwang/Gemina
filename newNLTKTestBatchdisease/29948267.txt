 Surgical site infections ( SSIs<ORGANIZATION> ) are associated with considerable medical expenditure. While head and neck free flap reconstruction has gradually become routine management following an ablative oncologic resection, reports on factors contributing to the SSIs<ORGANIZATION> are lacking. We retrospectively analyzed 173 new patients with oral cancer without any antecedent treatment at a tertiary medical center from 2010 to 2015. We determined incidence rates of SSIs<ORGANIZATION> within 30 days postoperatively and identified independent risk factors using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of 173 patients, 67 ( 38.7 % ) had SSIs<ORGANIZATION>. Multivariate analysis demonstrated operative time [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.199, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.036-1.389 ], mandibulectomy ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 2.759 ; 95 % CI = 1.245-6.111 ), and oro-neck communication ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 5.358 ; 95 % CI = 2.150-13.355 ) as independent predictors for SSIs<ORGANIZATION>. For patients with oral cancer undergoing free tissue reconstruction, mandibulectomy, oro-neck communication, and prolonged operative time were associated with increased incidence of SSIs<ORGANIZATION>.
