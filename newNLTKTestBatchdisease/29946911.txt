 This study investigated the incidence rate and features of vascular adverse events ( VAEs<ORGANIZATION> ) in Japanese<GPE> patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML<ORGANIZATION> ) who were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs<ORGANIZATION> ). The analysis included 369 CML patients in the chronic or accelerated phases, selected from the CML Cooperative Study Group<ORGANIZATION> database ; 25 events in 23 ( 6.2 % ) of these patients were VAEs<ORGANIZATION>. At the time of VAE<ORGANIZATION> incidence, nine patients were on treatment with imatinib, 12 with nilotinib, three with dasatinib, and one with bosutinib. VAE<ORGANIZATION> incidence comprised 13 cases of ischemic heart disease ( IHD<ORGANIZATION> ), eight of cerebral infarction ( CI ), and four of peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAOD<ORGANIZATION> ). IHD incidence rate in the study population was higher than that in the age-matched general population, particularly in nilotinib-treated patients, while CI<ORGANIZATION> incidence rate was almost equivalent. Compared with the Suita<ORGANIZATION> score, the SCORE<ORGANIZATION> chart and the Framingham<GPE> score risk assessment tools detected more patients with high or very high risk of VAEs<ORGANIZATION>. In conclusion, incidence of IHD<ORGANIZATION> requires closer monitoring in nilotinib-treated patients. More detailed investigations for determining the most useful tool to predict VAE<ORGANIZATION> incidence and long-term analysis of therapy-related VAE<ORGANIZATION> cases are needed for improving safety during TKI<ORGANIZATION> therapy.
