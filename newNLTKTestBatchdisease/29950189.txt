 For many years, patient-area wastewater drains ( ie, sink and shower drains ) have been considered a potential source of bacterial pathogens that can be transmitted to patients. Recently, evolving genomic epidemiology tools combined with new insights into the ecology of wastewater drain ( WWD<ORGANIZATION> ) biofilm have provided new perspectives on the clinical relevance and hospital-associated infection ( HAI<ORGANIZATION> ) transmission risks related to these fixtures. To further clarify the clinical relevance of WWD-associated pathogen transmission, reports of outbreaks attributed to WWDs<ORGANIZATION> were selected for review that ( 1 ) investigated the outbreak epidemiology of WWD-associated transmission of bacterial pathogens, ( 2 ) utilized advanced microbiologic methods to establish clonality of outbreak pathogens and/or resistance genes, or ( 3 ) described interventions implemented to mitigate transmission of the outbreak pathogens from WWDs<ORGANIZATION>. These reports were collated, compared, and analyzed, and the results are presented here.
