 In 2012, Nigeria<GPE> 's Federal Ministry<ORGANIZATION> of Health<PERSON> published its National Strategic Framework<ORGANIZATION> for the Elimination<ORGANIZATION> of Obstetric Fistula<ORGANIZATION> ( NSFEOF<ORGANIZATION> ), 2011-2015. The framework has since lapsed and there is no tangible evidence that the goal of eliminating obstetric fistula was met. To further inform future policy directions on obstetric fistula in Nigeria<GPE>, this paper explores how the NSFEOF<ORGANIZATION> conceptualized obstetric fistula and its related issues, including child marriage and early childbearing. A critical discourse analysis of the policy was performed. We examined four policies in addition to the strategic framework: the Nigerian<GPE> constitution ; the Marriage Act<ORGANIZATION> ; the Matrimonial Causes Act<ORGANIZATION> ; and the National<ORGANIZATION> Reproductive Health Policy. We used the three phases of critical discourse analysis: textual analysis, analysis of discourse practice, and analysis of discursive events as instances of sociocultural practice. The analysis demonstrates that, despite its title, the policy document focuses on reduction rather than elimination of obstetric fistula. The overall orientation of the policy is downstream, with minimal focus on prevention. The policy language suggests victim blaming. Furthermore, the extent to which subnational stakeholders in government and civil society were engaged in decision-making process for developing this policy is ambiguous. Although the policy is ostensibly based on principles of social justice and equity, several rhetorical positions suggest that the Nigerian<GPE> constitutional environment and justice systems make no real provisions to protect the reproductive rights of girls in accordance with the United Nations<ORGANIZATION> ' `` 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development<ORGANIZATION>. '' This analysis establishes that the Nigerian<GPE> constitution, justice environment and the obstetric fistula policy itself do not demonstrate clear commitment to eradicating obstetric fistula. Specifically, a clear commitment to eradicating obstetric fistula would see the constitution and Marriage Act<PERSON> of Nigeria<GPE> specify an age of consent that is consistent with the agenda to prevent obstetric fistula. Additionally, a policy to end obstetric fistulas in Nigeria<GPE> must purposefully address the factors creating barrier to women 's access to quality maternal healthcare services. Future policies and programs to eliminate obstetric fistulas should include perspectives of nurses, midwives, researchers and, women 's interest groups.
