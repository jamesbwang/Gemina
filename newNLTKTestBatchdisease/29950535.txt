 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML<ORGANIZATION> ) is a rare but fatal disease leading to severe neurological impairments. PML<ORGANIZATION> is a clinical manifestation, which is usually associated with John Cunningham<PERSON> virus ( JCV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection. It is also correlated to malignancies that mainly include hematologic malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL<ORGANIZATION> ). Until now, no specific treatment has been established for JCV-induced PML ; therefore, the prognosis of this disease is poor.We present a case of a 67-year-old woman who suffered from CLL<ORGANIZATION> with a chief complaint of seizure. Her clinical symptoms, results of brain MRI<ORGANIZATION> and biopsy were suggestive for the JCV-induced PML. The patient had received treatment using mefloquine at dose of 250 mg/day with no clinical improvement.
