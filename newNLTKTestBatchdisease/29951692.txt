 Medial<GPE> closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomy ( MCWDFO<ORGANIZATION> ) was used to treat valgus knee malalignment combined with lateral compartment disease. The clinical outcome of the osteotomy depends on the accurate correction of valgus malalignment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a MCWDFO<ORGANIZATION> assisted by three-dimensional ( 3D ) -printed cutting guides and locking guides. Thirty-three consecutive patients ( 33 knees ) were operated on using the same MCWDFO<ORGANIZATION>. 3D-printed cutting guides and locking guides were used to locate the osteotomy cut plane and to facilitate closing the wedge in 12 patients ( 3D-guide group ). Another 21 patients ( conventional group ) underwent MCWDFO<ORGANIZATION> following the conventional technique. The desired correction was defined as a weight-bearing line ( WBL<ORGANIZATION> ) coordinate 50 % of the width of the tibial plateau from the medial tibial margin. The deviation between the planned and executed WBL<ORGANIZATION> coordinate, surgical time and fluoroscopic time were compared. The mean deviation between the planned and executed WBL<ORGANIZATION> coordinate was 4.9 % in the 3D-guide group and 7.6 % in the conventional group ( P<PERSON> = 0.024 ). Shorter surgical time was found in the 3D-guide group ( mean, 77.7 minutes vs. mean, 96.5 minutes ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), while the mean number of intra-operative fluoroscopic images was 6.1, compared with 34.7 in the conventional group ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). The use of 3D-printed cutting guides and locking guides can increase the precision of the MCWDFO<ORGANIZATION> in patients with lateral compartment disease and valgus deformity, making our surgery more efficiency and occupying less fluoroscopic time.
