 No effective targeted therapy exists for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC<ORGANIZATION> ), the major cell type of esophageal cancer. The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -6 is associated with adverse prognosis of some cancers, and the open reading frame of IL-6 contains an miR-608 microRNA-targeted site. We investigated the correlation of circulating IL-6 levels with prognosis and with the mir608: rs4919510 genetic polymorphism in ESCC<GPE>. A total of 213 patients with primary ESCC<ORGANIZATION> were enrolled. Plasma<PERSON> IL-6 levels of ESCC<ORGANIZATION> patients were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA<ORGANIZATION> ). The patients ' genotypes of mir608: rs4919510 were analyzed using the MassARRAY<ORGANIZATION> system, and functional assays were performed by transient overexpression in cells. The cytotoxicity of IL-6 signaling blockers in ESCC<ORGANIZATION> cells was analyzed by MTT<ORGANIZATION> assay. We found that plasma IL-6 levels significantly correlated with overall survival ( p = 0.019 ), disease recurrence ( p = 0.003 ), and postoperative complications ( p =0.002 ). Patients with the GG<ORGANIZATION> genotype of mir608: rs4919510 had a 4.56-fold increased risk of high expression of IL-6 compared with patients with the CC<ORGANIZATION> genotype ( odds ratio 4.56, 95 % confidence interval 1.87-11.09 ; p =0.001 ). Transient overexpression of the miR-608 C ( miR-608_C ) and G variants ( miR-608_G ) in cancer cells revealed that the miR-608_G variant was less efficient in regulating the expression of IL-6 compared with miR-608_C. Finally, the IL-6 signaling blocker ruxolitinib exhibited effective cytotoxicity in ESCC<ORGANIZATION> cells. The results of this study provide a novel direction for a biomarker-based targeted therapy for ESCC<ORGANIZATION>.
