 Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates after hepato-pancreato-biliary ( HPB<ORGANIZATION> ) surgery remain high, and the number of elderly patients requiring such surgery has been increasing. This study aimed to investigate postoperative outcomes of complex HPB<ORGANIZATION> surgery for elderly patients. We retrospectively reviewed perioperative data of 721 patients who underwent complex HPB<ORGANIZATION> surgery between 2010 and 2015. The patients were divided into 2 groups: elderly ( â‰¥75 years ) and non-elderly ( < 75 years ). Surgical outcomes of both groups were compared after propensity score-matching analysis. Subsequently, risk factors for serious postoperative morbidity were identified by multivariate analysis. Before matching, the elderly group ( n = 170 ) had more comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and renal disease, than the non-elderly group ( n = 551 ). Matching yielded elderly ( n = 170 ) and non-elderly groups ( n = 170 ) with similar preoperative backgrounds. The mortality and morbidity rates did not differ significantly between the groups. In multivariate analyses, operative time ( OR 1.79 ; p = 0.005 ) and blood loss ( OR 1.66 ; p = 0.03 ) were identified as independent risk factors for serious postoperative morbidity, whereas older age did not have a predictive impact ( OR 1.16 ; p = 0.52 ). Although elderly -patients had more comorbidities and higher incidences of postoperative mortality and several complications before matching, their postoperative outcomes were equivalent to those of non-elderly patients after matching.
