 The FDA<ORGANIZATION> issued 2 main drug safety communications ( DSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) on the cardiovascular safety of tiotropium in March 2008 ( warning of a potential increased stroke risk ) and January 2010 ( informing of an absence of a significant increased stroke risk or cardiovascular events based on findings from a large trial ). To describe the effect of the FDA<ORGANIZATION> DSCs on medication dispensing of tiotropium in a large U.S.<GPE> claims database. Initiation of tiotropium products among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ) aged 40 years and older was determined monthly from 2006-2012 using medication dispensing from the IMS Lifelink Health Plan Claims Database<ORGANIZATION>. Similarly, monthly initiation of products containing long-acting beta-agonists ( LABAs<ORGANIZATION> ) was calculated to explore product switching. The effect of the 2008 and 2010 FDA<ORGANIZATION> DSCs was measured using interrupted time-series analysis. Subgroups of patients with greater cardiovascular risk were also examined. A decreasing trend in initiation of tiotropium-containing products was present before the initial 2008 DSC. The decline in tiotropium initiation continued until January 2010, accompanied by an increased initiation of LABA-containing products in patients with COPD<ORGANIZATION>. In the presence of the existing decreasing trend, the initial DSC<ORGANIZATION> was followed by an immediate 2.8 % ( P<PERSON> = 0.02 ) further reduction in tiotropium initiation. Tiotropium<PERSON> initiation increased 2.5 % ( P<PERSON> = 0.03 ) immediately after the 2010 DSC, reducing the overall decline in rate and stabilizing ( flattening ) the trend. No significant changes in dispensing level or trend were observed among COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients with cardiovascular comorbidity. Cardiovascular<PERSON> safety concerns may have affected tiotropium initiation as indicated by the decrease in tiotropium dispensing shown immediately following the initial DSC<ORGANIZATION>. The effect was alleviated as concerns lessened following the most recent DSC<ORGANIZATION>.
