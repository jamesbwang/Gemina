 Aim of the present study is to compare magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) and positron emission tomography ( PET<ORGANIZATION> ) parameters in the follow up of chronic periaortitis ( CP ), with a focus on changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC<ORGANIZATION> ) and standardized uptake values ( SUV<ORGANIZATION> ). 127 patients with CP<ORGANIZATION> were treated in our urology between 2007 and 2017. We identified 14 patients with parallel abdominal MRI<ORGANIZATION> and PET-CT examinations before therapy and in the follow up resulting in a total of 56 examinations. Relative contrast uptake and diffusion-weighted MRI<ORGANIZATION> parameters were compared to SUV<ORGANIZATION> in the corresponding PET-CT examinationsand laboratory infection markers. All examined MRI<ORGANIZATION> and PET-CT parameters showed significant changes between basis and follow-up examinations. Median ADC<PERSON> values increased significantly ( p < 0.001 ) in the follow up. SUVmax<ORGANIZATION> and the other MR parameter ( contrast uptake, DWI-signal ) declined significantly. We observed a strong negative correlation between ADC<ORGANIZATION> and SUVmax<ORGANIZATION> ( rho: - 0.61 ; p < 0.001 ). In addition, we found an inverse correlation of ADC<ORGANIZATION> with the inflammation markers ESR<ORGANIZATION> ( rho: - 0.64 ; p < 0.001 ) and CRP<ORGANIZATION> ( rho: - 0.54 ; p = 0.001 ). MRI<ORGANIZATION> and PET-CT showed comparable results in the individual follow up of CP<ORGANIZATION> and compared to laboratory inflammation markers. Our data support MRI as first imaging modality due to absent radiation and the necessity of repetitive follow-up examinations in patients with CP<ORGANIZATION>.
