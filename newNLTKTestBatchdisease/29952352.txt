 The migration and invasion of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs<ORGANIZATION> ) caused by advanced aging play an important role in diffuse intimal thickening, facilitate adverse arterial remodeling and contribute to the initiation and progression of cardiovascular diseases. The inhibitory function of Buyang Huanwu<PERSON> decoction ( BYHWD<ORGANIZATION> ) has been found on aortic intimal hyperplasia and VSMC<ORGANIZATION> proliferation, but its effect on age-associated migration and invasion remains unknown. Here, we used an in vitro angiotensin II ( Ang II<PERSON> ) -induced senescence model to study the effects of serum containing BYHWD<ORGANIZATION> ( BYHWS<ORGANIZATION> ) on the migratory and invasive capacities, matrix metalloprotease type 2 ( MMP-2 ) expression and modulation of sirtuin1 ( SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> ) signaling in human aorta VSMCs<ORGANIZATION> ( HA-VAMCs ). Our results showed that BYHWS<ORGANIZATION> was able to inhibit Ang<PERSON> II-induced migration and invasion, with down-regulation of MMP-2. In addition, manipulation of SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> by either over-expression or siRNA knockdown ameliorated or promoted cellular migration and invasion, respectively. Moreover, BYHWS<ORGANIZATION> reversed senescence-mediated decrease of SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> levels and SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> was required for BYHWS<ORGANIZATION> regulation on migration and invasion of senescent HA-VAMCs. In summary, our data demonstrated that BYHWS<ORGANIZATION> suppressed the migration and invasion of age-associated VSMC<ORGANIZATION> via an increase of the SIRT1<ORGANIZATION> level, which provides novel insights for the therapy of age-associated cardiovascular diseases.
