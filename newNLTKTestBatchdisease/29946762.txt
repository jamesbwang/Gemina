 The association among serum homocysteine ( HCY<ORGANIZATION> ), symmetric dimethylarginine ( SDMA<ORGANIZATION> ), and asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA<ORGANIZATION> ) is of interest in endothelial dysfunction, although the underlying pathology is not fully elucidated. We investigated the relationship of HCY<ORGANIZATION> with SDMA<ORGANIZATION> and ADMA<ORGANIZATION> regarding their long-time outcome and the age dependency of HCY<ORGANIZATION>, SDMA<ORGANIZATION>, and ADMA<ORGANIZATION> values in claudicant patients with lower extremity arterial disease. 120 patients were included in a prospective observational study ( observation time 7.96 ± 1.3 years ) with cardiovascular mortality as the main outcome parameter. Patients with intermittent claudication prior to their first endovascular procedure were included. HCY<ORGANIZATION>, SDMA<ORGANIZATION>, and ADMA<ORGANIZATION> were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Cutoff<PERSON> values for HCY<ORGANIZATION> ( ≤/ > 15 µmol/l ), SDMA<ORGANIZATION> ( ≤/ > 0.75 µmol/l ), and ADMA<ORGANIZATION> ( ≤/ > 0.8 µmol/l ) differed significantly regarding cardiovascular mortality ( p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.017, respectively ). Age<PERSON> correlated significantly with HCY<ORGANIZATION> ( r = 0.393 ; p < 0.001 ), SDMA<ORGANIZATION> ( r = 0.363 ; p < 0.001 ), and ADMA<ORGANIZATION> ( r = 0.210 ; p = 0.021 ). HCY<ORGANIZATION> and SDMA<ORGANIZATION> ( r = 0.295 ; p = 0.001 ) as well as SDMA<ORGANIZATION> and ADMA<ORGANIZATION> ( r = 0.380 ; p < 0.001 ) correlated with each other, while HCY<ORGANIZATION> and ADMA<ORGANIZATION> did not correlate ( r = 0.139 ; p = 0.130 ). Patients older than 65 years had higher values of HCY<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.001 ) and SDMA<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.01 ), but not of ADMA<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.133 ). In multivariable linear regression, age was the only significant independent risk factor for cardiovascular death ( beta coefficient 0.413 ; 95 % CI 0.007-0.028 ; p = 0.001 ). Age<PERSON> correlated significantly with HCY<ORGANIZATION>, SDMA<ORGANIZATION>, and ADMA<ORGANIZATION>. However, only age was an independent predictor for cardiovascular death. Older patients have higher values of HCY<ORGANIZATION> and SDMA<ORGANIZATION> than younger subjects suggesting age-adjusted cutoff values of HCY<ORGANIZATION> and SDMA<ORGANIZATION> due to strong age dependency.
