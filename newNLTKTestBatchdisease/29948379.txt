 During 2014-2015, clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx highly pathogenic ( HP ) avian influenza A viruses ( IAV<ORGANIZATION> ) were first detected in North America<GPE> and subsequently caused one of the largest agricultural emergencies in U.S<GPE>. Recent evidence has suggested that cottontail rabbits can shed multiple IAV<ORGANIZATION> subtypes. We experimentally infected cottontail rabbits with three HP H5Nx IAVs. All rabbits tested shed virus on at least one day by at least one route. Cottontail<PERSON> rabbits appear to be an exception to the limited capacity for replication that has been previously reported for certain other mammalian species inoculated with clade 2.3.4.4 HP H5Nx avian influenza A viruses.
