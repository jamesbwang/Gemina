 Invasive meningococcal disease remains a public health concern because of its rapid onset and significant risk of death and long-term disability. New meningococcal serogroup B and combination serogroup ACWY<ORGANIZATION> vaccines are being considered for publicly funded immunization programs in many countries. Contemporary costing data associated with invasive meningococcal disease are required to inform cost-effectiveness analyses. The objective of this study was to estimate costs and resource utilization associated with acute infection and the long-term care of invasive meningococcal disease. PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, EMBASE<ORGANIZATION>, The Cochrane Library<ORGANIZATION>, health economic databases, and electronically available conference abstracts were searched. Studies reporting any costs associated with acute infection and long-term sequelae of invasive meningococcal disease in English<GPE> were included. All costs were converted into purchasing power parity-adjusted estimates [ international dollars ( I $ ) ] using the Campbell<ORGANIZATION> and Cochrane Economics Methods Group<PERSON> and the Evidence<ORGANIZATION> for Policy<PERSON> and Practice Information<ORGANIZATION> and Coordinating Centre cost converter. Fourteen studies met our eligibility criteria and were included. The mean costs of acute admission ranged from I $ 1629 to I $ 50,796, with an incremental cost of I $ 16,378. The mean length of hospital stay was reported to be 6-18 days in multiple studies. The average costs reported for readmissions ranged from I $ 7905 to I $ 15,908. Key variables such as the presence of sequelae were associated with higher hospitalization costs and longer inpatient stay. No studies estimated direct non-healthcare costs and productivity loss. Ten studies reported only unadjusted mean values without using appropriate statistical methods for adjustment. Invasive meningococcal disease can result in substantial costs to healthcare systems. However, costing data on long-term follow-up and indirect costs used to populate health economic models are lacking.
