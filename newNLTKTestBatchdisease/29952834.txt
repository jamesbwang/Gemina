 To summarize recent findings from the application of MRI<ORGANIZATION> in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis ( MS ), and to review the insights into disease pathophysiology and the utility of MRI<ORGANIZATION> for monitoring treatment response. New evidence from the application of MRI<ORGANIZATION> in patients with clinically isolated syndromes has guided the 2017 revision of the McDonald<ORGANIZATION> criteria for MS diagnosis, which has simplified their clinical use while preserving accuracy. Other MRI<ORGANIZATION> measures ( e.g., cortical lesions and central vein signs ) may improve diagnostic specificity, but their assessment still needs to be standardized, and their reliability confirmed. Novel MRI<PERSON> techniques are providing fundamental insights into the pathological substrates of the disease and are helping to give a better understanding of its clinical manifestations. Combined clinical-MRI measures of disease activity and progression, together with the use of clinically relevant MRI<ORGANIZATION> measures ( e.g., brain atrophy ) might improve treatment monitoring, but these are still not ready for the clinical setting. Advances in MRI<ORGANIZATION> technology are improving the diagnostic work-up and monitoring of MS, even in the earliest phases of the disease, and are providing MRI<ORGANIZATION> measures that are more specific and sensitive to disease pathological substrates.
