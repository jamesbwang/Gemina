 DEFA1/DEFA3, genes encoding human neutrophil peptides ( HNP<ORGANIZATION> ) 1-3, display wide-ranging copy number variations ( CNVs<ORGANIZATION> ) and is functionally associated with innate immunity and infections. To identify potential associations between DEFA1/DEFA3 CNV and hospital-acquired infections ( HAIs<ORGANIZATION> ), we enrolled 106 patients with HAIs<ORGANIZATION> and 109 controls in the intensive care unit ( ICU<ORGANIZATION> ) and examined their DEFA1/DEFA3 CNVs. DEFA1/DEFA3 copy number ranged from 2 to 16 per diploid genome in all 215 critically ill patients, with a median of 7 copies. In HAIs<GPE>, DEFA1/DEFA3 CNV varied from 2 to 12 with a median of 6, which was significantly lower than that in controls ( 2 to 16 with a median of 8,
