 Mitochondrial DNA<ORGANIZATION> ( mtDNA<ORGANIZATION> ) mutations are found in many types of cancers and suspected to be involved in carcinogenesis, although the mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, we report that consecutive C-to-T mutations ( hypermutations ), a unique feature of mutations induced by APOBECs<ORGANIZATION>, are found in mtDNA from cervical dysplasia and oropharyngeal cancers. In vitro, we found that APOBEC3A<ORGANIZATION> ( A3A ) and 3B ( A3B ) expression, as well as mtDNA<ORGANIZATION> hypermutation, were induced in a cervical dysplastic cell line W12 when cultured in a differentiating condition. The ectopic expression of A3A or A3B<PERSON> was sufficient to hypermutate mtDNA<ORGANIZATION>. Fractionation of W12<GPE> cell lysates and immunocytochemical analysis revealed that A3A<PERSON> and A3B<PERSON> could be contained in mitochondrion. These results suggest that mtDNA<ORGANIZATION> hypermutation is induced upon keratinocyte differentiation, and shed light on its molecular mechanism, which involves A3s<ORGANIZATION>. The possible involvement of mtDNA<ORGANIZATION> hypermutations in carcinogenesis is also discussed.
