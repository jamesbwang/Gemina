 This meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of culprit-only revascularization ( COR<ORGANIZATION> ) and complete revascularization ( CR ) in the treatment of patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI<ORGANIZATION> ) and multivessel disease to determine the optimal reperfusion strategy. We analyzed published multicenter randomized controlled trials to compare COR<ORGANIZATION> and CR in patients with acute STEMI<ORGANIZATION> and multivessel disease. The PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Cochrane Library<PERSON>, and Ovid<GPE> databases were searched, and the meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager<PERSON> 5.3 software. Eight<PERSON> multicenter randomized controlled trials were selected involving 2870 patients, of whom 1604 underwent COR<ORGANIZATION> and 1266 underwent CR. No significant heterogeneity was identified across these selected studies. The CR<ORGANIZATION> strategy significantly decreased the incidence of major adverse cardiac events ( MACE<ORGANIZATION> ; odds ratio [ OR ]: 2.44, 95 % CI [ 95 % confidence interval ]: 1.96-3.03, p < 0.001 ), mortality ( OR: 1.76, 95 % CI: 1.25-2.47, p = 0.001 ), myocardial infarction ( MI<ORGANIZATION>, OR: 1.62, 95 % CI: 1.12-2.35, p = 0.01 ), and repeat revascularization ( OR: 3.20, 95 % CI: 2.41-4.24, p < 0.001 ) compared with the COR<ORGANIZATION> approach. Moreover, no significant difference was identified in the safety indexes, including contrast-induced nephropathy, stroke, and bleeding, between the CR<ORGANIZATION> and the COR<ORGANIZATION> group ( p > 0.05 ). The present meta-analysis determined that CR<ORGANIZATION> is an efficacious and safe reperfusion strategy in patients with acute STEMI<ORGANIZATION> and multivessel disease.
