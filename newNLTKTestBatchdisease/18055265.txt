 The lack of effective differential diagnostic methods for active tuberculosis ( TB ) and latent infection ( LTBI<ORGANIZATION> ) is still an obstacle for TB<ORGANIZATION> control. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism behind the progression from LTBI<ORGANIZATION> to active TB<ORGANIZATION> has been not elucidated. Therefore, we performed label-free quantitative proteomics to identify plasma biomarkers for discriminating pulmonary TB ( PTB<ORGANIZATION> ) from LTBI<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 31 overlapping proteins with significant difference in expression level were identified in PTB<ORGANIZATION> patients (
