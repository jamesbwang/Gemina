 To explore the influence of FLT3-ITD mutation and ITD<ORGANIZATION> length on the overall survival ( OS ) and relapse free survival ( RFS<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia. Clinical<PERSON> features and therapeutic effect were retrospectively analyzed in 75 AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation and 76 FLT3-ITD AML<ORGANIZATION> patients with FLT3-ITD mutation had higher WBC<ORGANIZATION> count and the ratio of BM<ORGANIZATION> blast cells at initial diagnosis was also higher than those in AML<ORGANIZATION> patients without FLT3-ITD mutation ( 95.13 vs 10.85 ) ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) ; 72 % vs 59 % ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). The CR<ORGANIZATION> rates in AML<ORGANIZATION> patients with FLT3-ITD mutation less than those in AML<ORGANIZATION> patients without FLT3-ITD mutation ( 70.42 % vs 94.7 % ) ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). OS ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) and RFS<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) were significantly increased in patients with AML<ORGANIZATION> who received allo-HSCT as compared with the patients who received consolidation chemotherapy and similar to AML<ORGANIZATION> patients without FLT3-ITD mutation who received HSCT<ORGANIZATION>. Patients with maintenance sorafenib after HSCT<ORGANIZATION> had longer OS ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) and RFS<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) than controls. ITDs exceeding 60 bp in length were associated with decreasing OS as compared with shorter ITD in AML<ORGANIZATION> patients with FLT3-ITD mutation ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). OS and RFS<ORGANIZATION> were similar among the 2 groups receiving consolidation chemotherapy. Besides, the patients with allo-HSCT had shorter ITDs<ORGANIZATION> and longer OS than ITDs<ORGANIZATION> exceeding 60 bp ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) and similar to AML<ORGANIZATION> patients without FLT3-ITD mutation. AML<ORGANIZATION> patients with FLT3-ITD mutation has poorer outcome, among which the prognosis was worse in patients with ITD<ORGANIZATION> exceeding 60 bp, and the chemotherapy alone can not improve the prognosis of FLT3-ITD
