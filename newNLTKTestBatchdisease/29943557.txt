 Recent studies have shown that inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD<ORGANIZATION> ) patients are affected by altered body composition, especially low muscle mass or sarcopenia. Detection of sarcopenia is important, as it can independently predict osteopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and poor disease outcomes during IBD<ORGANIZATION> progress. The challenges are needed to identify diagnostic and managing strategies for sarcopenia in IBD<ORGANIZATION> to improve disease outcomes and increase the quality of life in patients with IBD<ORGANIZATION>.
