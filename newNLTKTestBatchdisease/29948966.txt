 To investigate the clinical features of necrotizing pneumonia ( NP ) caused by refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia ( RMPP<ORGANIZATION> ). A retrospective observational study was carried out in patients with NP<ORGANIZATION> caused by RMPP<ORGANIZATION> who were admitted to our hospital from January 2008 to December 2015, and the clinical manifestations, laboratory data, imaging performances, hospital courses and outcomes were analyzed. Twenty-five patients with NP<ORGANIZATION> caused by RMPP<ORGANIZATION> were collected, with a median age of 5.1 ( 4.0-7.9 ) years. The mean duration of fever and hospital stay was 21.0 ± 8.9 and 19.9 ± 9.9 days, respectively. The levels of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH<ORGANIZATION> ), C-reactive protein, interleukin ( IL ) -6, IL-10 and interferon-gamma were elevated. Meanwhile, the pleural fluid cell count, LDH<ORGANIZATION> and protein were also increased. 80.0 % of the patients had pleural effusion ; and a high incidence of lobar atelectasis and pulmonary consolidation was found the patients. The mean duration from the onset of symptoms to the discovery of necrotic lesions was 21.0 ± 6.9 days. 80.0 % of the patients were administrated corticosteroids, and bronchoalveolar lavage was extracted separately from all patients. Of the 20 patients who presented with pleural effusion, 11 underwent thoracocentesis alone and 2 underwent chest drainage. All patients received prolonged courses of antibiotics ( 32.2 ± 8.7 days ). All patients were dischaged home and recovered without surgical intervention ; and chest lesions were resolved or only minimal residual fibrotic changes were residual within 3.0 ( 2.0-6.0 ) months. Necrotizing pneumonia caused by RMPP<ORGANIZATION> is severe, however, self-limiting and reversible. Good outcomes can be achieved with appropriate management.
