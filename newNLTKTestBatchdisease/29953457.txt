 Both household food insecurity and household dietary diversity have been found reliable in describing the dietary intake of a population. However, it had not been proven as reliable instrument for assessing nutritional status of individuals in a clinical context. There has been a need for evidence on the validity of using proxy and easy dietary indicators for nutritional status. A facility based cross sectional study design was employed on 423 people with HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection visiting all ART clinics in Bahir Dar<GPE>, North Ethiopia<GPE>. Nutritional status was determined by computing BMI<ORGANIZATION>. Food<PERSON> insecurity was assessed using household food insecurity access scale. Dietary diversity was measured using a tool adopted from Food<GPE> and Nutrition Technical Assistance Project<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> were entered to Epidata<GPE> version 3.1and analyzed by SPSS<ORGANIZATION> version 20. Reliability analysis, sensitivity and specificity analysis were determined. The sensitivity of the household food insecurity access scale and dietary diversity score was 87.9 % and 79.8 %, respectively, while their specificity was 56.2 % and 70.2 %. The AUC<ORGANIZATION> at 95 % CI for the household food insecurity access scale and household dietary diversity score were 73.4 ( 68.4-78.4 ) and 73.1 ( 68.1-78.2 ) while their cut of point that maximized their sensitivity and specificity was 1 and 6 respectively. Household<ORGANIZATION> food insecurity access scale and household dietary diversity score were found to be reliable tools with a Cronbach<GPE> 's Alpha of 0.926 and 0.799, respectively. In assessing under nutrition among PLHIV<ORGANIZATION> especially in limited resource settings, both the household food insecurity access scale and household dietary diversity score were found valid and reliable proxy indicators for measuring nutritional status.
