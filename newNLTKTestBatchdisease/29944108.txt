 Itraconazole<GPE> ( ITZ<ORGANIZATION> ) has a broad spectrum of action and is commonly used for the treatment of fungal infections. Topic<PERSON> administration of ITZ<ORGANIZATION> is a promising strategy to improve vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment, which can be further optimized by its encapsulation in nanoparticles to increase drug delivery and reduce ITZ<ORGANIZATION> toxicity. In this work, we designed polycaprolactone nanoparticles containing ITZ<ORGANIZATION> and evaluated in vivo the efficacy of this yet unexplored approach. Nanocapsules ( ITZ-NC ) and nanospheres ( ITZ-NS ) were obtained by nanoprecipitation. ITZ-NC presented encapsulation efficiency of 99 %, mean diameter of 190 nm, PDI<ORGANIZATION> 0.1 and zeta potential of -15 mV. ITZ-NS showed encapsulation efficiency of 97 %, mean diameter of 120 nm, PDI<ORGANIZATION> 0.1 and zeta potential of -10 mV. Both particles were efficiently freeze-dried using 10 % trehalose + 10 % sucrose. Nanoparticles were then incorporated in a viscous formulation for vaginal application in female Balb/C mice infected with Candida<GPE> albicans. Fungal<PERSON> load was significantly reduced in infected animals after treatment with ITZ-NC but not with ITZ-NS, compared to animals treated with ITZ<ORGANIZATION> solution. Histological analysis showed a clear difference between vaginal tissues of ITZ-NC and ITZ-NS and ITZ<ORGANIZATION> solution-treated animals, which correlated with IL-1β and TNF-α quantification. Animals<PERSON> treated with ITZ-NC<PERSON> showed reduced cytokine levels and healthy tissue characteristics, while animals treated with ITZ-NS and ITZ<ORGANIZATION> solution showed increased IL-1β and TNF-α levels and typical tissue inflammation. Our results demonstrate the potential of ITZ-NC to improve the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis after topical application in the vagina, opening new perspectives for the treatment of this disease.
