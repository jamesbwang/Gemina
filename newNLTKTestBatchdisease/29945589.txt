 Emergency<PERSON> Department<ORGANIZATION> ( ED ) revisits have often been used as an indicator of medical care quality. This study aimed to quantify the frequency of ED<ORGANIZATION> revisits within 72 h of discharge and identify its factors among children with chronic diseases. We designed a retrospective cohort study of children with at least one chronic disease who were also under 18 years of age and had attended and were discharged from the ED at King Abdullah Specialist Children<FACILITY> 's Hospital<ORGANIZATION> ( KASCH-RD ), Riyadh<GPE>, Saudi Arabia<GPE> between April 19, 2015 and July 29, 2017. The outcome measure was the frequency of ED<ORGANIZATION> revisits during a period of 72 h after discharge. The study included 11,057 ED discharges of children with at least one chronic disease. Their revisit rate was 1211 ( 11 % ), with 83 ( 6.9 % ) having had a second ED revisit within 72 h of ED<ORGANIZATION> discharge. According to ICD-10 codes, the most common causes of ED<ORGANIZATION> revisits were respiratory, digestive, genitourinary, symptoms, and external causes. Factors of frequent ED revisits within 72 h were young age, institutional health insurance coverage, year of new health information system ( 2015 ), external causes, and genitourinary. The rate of 72-h ED revisits after discharge of children with chronic diseases treated at KASCH-RD<ORGANIZATION> was relatively high, and was associated with young age, institutional health insurance coverage, year of a new health information system implementation, and external causes of ED<ORGANIZATION> visit. These study findings amplify the need for intervention to reduce the rate of early ED revisits among children with chronic diseases.
