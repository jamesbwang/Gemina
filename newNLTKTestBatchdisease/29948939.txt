 Mutations in the GBA<ORGANIZATION> gene, encoding the lysosomal hydrolase glucocerebrosidase ( GCase<ORGANIZATION> ), are the most common known genetic risk factor for Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease ( PD ) and dementia with Lewy<PERSON> bodies ( DLB<ORGANIZATION> ). The present study aims to gain more insight into changes in lysosomal activity in different brain regions of sporadic PD and DLB<ORGANIZATION> patients, screened for GBA<ORGANIZATION> variants. Enzymatic activities of GCase<ORGANIZATION>, Î²-hexosaminidase, and cathepsin D were measured in the frontal cortex, putamen, and substantia nigra ( SN ) of a cohort of patients with advanced PD and DLB<ORGANIZATION> as well as age-matched non-demented controls ( n = 15/group ) using fluorometric assays. Decreased activity of GCase<GPE> ( - 21 % ) and of cathepsin D ( - 15 % ) was found in the SN<ORGANIZATION> and frontal cortex of patients with PD<ORGANIZATION> and DLB<ORGANIZATION> compared to controls, respectively. Population stratification was applied based on GBA<ORGANIZATION> genotype, showing substantially lower GCase<ORGANIZATION> activity ( ~ - 40 % ) in GBA<ORGANIZATION> variant carriers in all regions. GCase activity was further significantly decreased in the SN<ORGANIZATION> of PD<ORGANIZATION> and DLB<ORGANIZATION> patients without GBA<ORGANIZATION> variants in comparison to controls without GBA<ORGANIZATION> variants. Our results show decreased GCase<ORGANIZATION> activity in brains of PD<ORGANIZATION> and DLB<ORGANIZATION> patients with and without GBA<ORGANIZATION> variants, most pronounced in the SN<ORGANIZATION>. The results of our study confirm findings from previous studies, suggesting a role for GCase<ORGANIZATION> in GBA-associated as well as sporadic PD and DLB<ORGANIZATION>.
