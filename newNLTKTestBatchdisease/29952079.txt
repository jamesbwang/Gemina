 Blood<GPE> is the most valuable and convenient source of disease diagnostic biomarkers, but plasma must be extracted from blood prior to further biomarker detection and analysis. Traditional plasma extraction methods depend greatly on benchtop equipment and are often cumbersome, time-consuming, and unsuitable for point-of-care ( POC<ORGANIZATION> ) applications. On the other hand, highly diluted blood plasma extraction methods potentially introduce greater test result uncertainty and lower detection sensitivity. Because simpler integrated and more efficient plasma extraction methods that avoid sample dilution are highly desired, we developed a simple dielectrophoresis ( DEP<ORGANIZATION> ) -based microfluidic device for plasma extraction from whole blood. The separation strategy was straightforward and the device was easy to manufacture, due to its lack of mechanistic complexity. Human<PERSON> plasma was extracted from whole blood without dilution or other complex pre-handling steps and attained purity approaching 100 %, with a calculated plasma yield of âˆ¼31 %. In addition, flow rate and voltage effects on extraction efficiency were also evaluated. This work provides a simple, integrated, non-invasive, continuous and efficient method for plasma extraction without dilution using a lab-on-chip platform with potential application for real-time biomarker detection from blood.
