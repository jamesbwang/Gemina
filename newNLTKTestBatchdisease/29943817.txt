 The epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT<ORGANIZATION> ) is a key event associated with metastasis and dissemination in breast tumor pathogenesis. Promyelocytic leukemia ( PML<ORGANIZATION> ) gene produces several isoforms due to alternative splicing ; however, the biological function of each specific isoform has yet to be identified. In this study, we report a previously unknown role for PMLIV<ORGANIZATION>, the most intensely studied nuclear isoform, in transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) signaling-associated EMT<ORGANIZATION> and migration in breast cancer. This study demonstrates that PMLIV<ORGANIZATION> overexpression promotes a more aggressive mesenchymal phenotype and increases the migration of MCF-7 cancer cells. This event is associated with activation of the TGF-β canonical signaling pathway through the induction of Smad2/3 phosphorylation and the translocation of phospho-Smad2/3 to the nucleus. In this study, we report a previously unknown role for PMLIV<ORGANIZATION> in TGF-β signaling-induced regulation of breast cancer-associated EMT<ORGANIZATION> and migration. Targeting this pathway may be therapeutically beneficial.
