 To investigate morbidity related to harversting of bilateral fibula free flap for head and neck reconstruction using subjective and functional tests. Patients were retrospectively evaluated using point evaluation system ( PES<ORGANIZATION> ) and balance evaluation systems test ( BESTest<ORGANIZATION> ) questionnaires to assess morbidity related to surgery. Five patients were enrolled in the study. Mean PES<PERSON> scores was 22.2 over 24. Mean overall function assessed with BESTest<ORGANIZATION> was 77.6 %, and the results were poorest for section I. Sections V and VI<ORGANIZATION> had scores of 88 % and 83 %, respectively, indicating that the sensory balance and gait stability of the patients were compromised only minimally. Bilateral harvesting of the fibula free flap is not associated with an increase in long-term morbidity and does not lead to significant functional impairments. Therefore, this procedure should be considered safe, and can be performed without concern regarding morbidity, when bone reconstruction with a fibula free flap is indicated.
