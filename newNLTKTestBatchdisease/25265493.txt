 Tuberculosis<GPE> ( TB ) prevention, including infection control, is a key element in the strategy to end the global TB epidemic. While effective infection control requires all health system components to function well, this is an area that has not received sufficient attention inSouth Africa<ORGANIZATION> despite the availability of policy and guidelines. To describe the state of implementation of TB<ORGANIZATION> infection control measures in a high-burden metro in South Africa<GPE>. The research was undertaken in a high TB- and HIV-burdened metropolitan area of South Africa<GPE>. More specifically, the study sites were primary health care facilities ( PHC<ORGANIZATION> ), thatamong other services also diagnosed TB. A cross-sectional survey, focusing on the World<ORGANIZATION> Health Organization levels of infection control, which included structured interviews with nurses providing TB<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis and treatment services as well as observations, at all 41 PHC facilities in a high TB-burdened and HIV-burdened metro of South Africa<GPE>. Tuberculosis infection control was poorly implemented, with few facilities scoring 80 % and above on compliance with infection control measures. Facility controls: 26 facilities ( 63.4 % ) had an infection control committee and 12 ( 29.3 % ) had a written infection control plan. Administrative controls: 26 facilities ( 63.4 % ) reported separating coughing and noncoughing patients, while observations revealed that only 11 facilities ( 26.8 % ) had separate waiting areas for ( presumptive ) TB patients. Environmental<ORGANIZATION> controls: most facilities used open windows for ventilation ( n = 30 ; 73.2 % ) ; however, on the day of the visit, only 12 facilities ( 30.3 % ) had open windows in consulting rooms. Personal protective equipment: 9 facilities ( 22 % ) did not have any disposable respirators in stock and only 9 respondents ( 22 % ) had undergone fit testing. The most frequently reported barrier to implementing good TBinfection<ORGANIZATION> control practices was lack of equipment ( n = 22 ; 40 % ) such as masks and disposable respirators, as well as the structure or layout of the PHC<ORGANIZATION> facilities. The main recommendation to improve TB infection control was education for patients and health care workers ( n = 18 ; 33.3 % ). All levels of the health care system should be engaged to address TB prevention and infection control in PHC<ORGANIZATION> facilities. Improved infection control will address the nosocomial spread of TB in health facilities and keep health care workers and patients safe from infection.
