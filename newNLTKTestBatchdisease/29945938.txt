 Despite increasing evidence for the involvement of bone marrow ( BM ) hematopoietic stem cell niche in leukemogenesis, how BM mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells ( MSPCs<ORGANIZATION> ) contribute to leukemia niche formation and progression remains unclear. Using an MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ) mouse model, we demonstrate dynamic alterations of BM<ORGANIZATION> cellular niche components, including MSPCs<ORGANIZATION> and endothelial cells during AML<ORGANIZATION> development and its association with AML<ORGANIZATION> engraftment. Primary patient AML<ORGANIZATION> cells also induced similar niche alterations in xenografted mice. AML<ORGANIZATION> cell infiltration in BM<ORGANIZATION> causes an expansion of early B-cell factor 2
