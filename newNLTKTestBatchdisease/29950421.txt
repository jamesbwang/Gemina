 The newly emerged Middle East<GPE> respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) continues to infect humans and camels, calling for efficient, cost-effective, and broad-spectrum strategies to control its spread. Nanobodies ( Nbs ) are single-domain antibodies derived from camelids and sharks, and are potentially cost-effective antivirals with small size and great expression yield. In this study, we developed a novel neutralizing Nb ( NbMS10<ORGANIZATION> ) and its human-Fc-fused version ( NbMS10-Fc ), both of which target the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain ( RBD<ORGANIZATION> ). We further tested their receptor-binding affinity, recognizing epitopes, cross-neutralizing activity, half-life, and efficacy against MERS-CoV infection. Both Nbs can be expressed in yeasts with high yield, bind to MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, and block the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the MERS-CoV receptor. The binding site of the Nbs<ORGANIZATION> on the RBD<ORGANIZATION> was mapped to be around residue Asp539<GPE>, which is part of a conserved conformational epitope at the receptor-binding interface. NbMS10<ORGANIZATION> and NbMS10-Fc maintained strong cross-neutralizing activity against divergent MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels. Particularly, NbMS10-Fc had significantly extended half-life
