 Prostate<GPE> artery embolisation ( PAE<ORGANIZATION> ) is a new minimally invasive treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS<ORGANIZATION> ) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH<ORGANIZATION> ). The purpose of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of PAE<ORGANIZATION> in the treatment of BPH<ORGANIZATION> with LUTS<ORGANIZATION>. A systematic review performed according to the PRISMA<ORGANIZATION> guidelines with a pre-specified search strategy for PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Web of Science<GPE>, Cochrane Library<PERSON> and Embase<ORGANIZATION> databases protocol ( PROSPERO<ORGANIZATION> ID: CRD42017059196 ). Trials studying the efficacy of prostate artery embolisation to treat LUTS<ORGANIZATION> with more than ten participants and follow-up longer than 6 months were included by two independent authors. Outcomes investigated were International Prostate Symptom Score<ORGANIZATION> ( IPSS<ORGANIZATION> ), quality of life ( QoL<ORGANIZATION> ), International Index<ORGANIZATION> of Erectile Function<ORGANIZATION> ( IIEF-5 ), prostate volume ( PV ), prostate-specific antigen ( PSA<ORGANIZATION> ), peak void flow ( Qmax<ORGANIZATION> ), post-void residual ( PVR<ORGANIZATION> ) and complications. To summarise mean change from baseline, a meta-analysis was done using the random-effects model. The search returned 210 references, of which 13 studies met the inclusion criteria, representing 1,254 patients. Patients in the included studies with data available for meta-analysis had moderate to severe LUTS<ORGANIZATION> and a mean IPSS<ORGANIZATION> of 23.5. Statistically significant ( p value < 0.05 ) improvements of all investigated outcomes were seen at 12-month follow-up. Major complications were reported in 0.3 % of the cases. Our findings suggest that PAE<ORGANIZATION> can reduce moderate to severe LUTS<ORGANIZATION> in men with BPH<ORGANIZATION> with a low risk of complications. • Prostate artery embolisation ( PAE<ORGANIZATION> ) improved International Prostate Symptom Score<ORGANIZATION> ( IPSS<ORGANIZATION> ) by 67 %. • Major complications after PAE<ORGANIZATION> are very rare. • Use of cone-beam CT may reduce risk of non-target embolisation.
