 Oxidative stress is associated with delayed recovery and higher risk of post-training pain in triathlon athletes. Therefore, supplementation with antioxidant compounds may have a role in enhancing recovery. Quercetin<PERSON> presents marked antioxidant activity. In this pilot registry study, we evaluated the effects of the supplementation with a novel proprietary delivery form ( phytosome速 ) of quercetin in amateur triathlon athletes. We employed a specific study model of triathlon according to the `` Sprint '' distance. The individual triathlon training included repetition of the run 8 times in 14 days. A group of athletes used quercetin phytosome速 supplementation ( one tablet of 250 mg quercetin phytosome速 twice daily ). A control group did not use supplementation. All subjects attended a baseline measurement run and a second final measurement run at day 14. At the end of the study, subjective performance, post-training pain, cramps, time to full recovery and oxidative stress were measured. In total, 23 subjects used the supplement and 25 did not. No side effects were reported. The improvement of time to complete the run was greater in subjects on quercetin supplementation compared with the control group ( -11.3 % vs. -3.9 % ; P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Training was considered more valuable in the quercetin group compared with controls ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Similarly, post-run muscular pain, cramps, localized pain and the post-exercise recovery time were all considered better with the supplementation ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Oxidative stress was also reduced ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). This pilot study suggests that the oral supplementation with quercetin phytosome速 may result in improved training and performance in amateur triathlon athletes.
