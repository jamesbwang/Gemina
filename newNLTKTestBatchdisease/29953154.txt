 α-Mangostin ( αMN<ORGANIZATION> ) is a xanthone present in the pericarp of Garcinia<GPE> mangostana Linn. which is mentioned in Ayurveda<GPE> and is a widely used functional food supplement. However, its anti-inflammatory mechanism is not well studied. Hence<PERSON>, we used in silico, in vitro and in vivo models to provide information of the mechanism on how αMN<ORGANIZATION> could prevent inflammation. Firstly, molecular docking was used to find out the binding energy of αMN<ORGANIZATION> with NFκB<ORGANIZATION> and COX<ORGANIZATION> proteins. Secondly, LPS<ORGANIZATION> induced RAW<ORGANIZATION> 264.7 cells were used to measure the production of cytokines, the prevention of translocation of NFκB<ORGANIZATION> and the inhibition of COX-1 and -2 enzymes. Finally, carrageenan-induced peritonitis was used in vivo to check cytokine release, leukocyte migration and vascular permeability. The in silico modelling had showed that αMN<ORGANIZATION> has the lowest binding energy with COX-2 and NFκB<ORGANIZATION> proteins. αMN<ORGANIZATION> has been found to inhibit the production of PGE2<ORGANIZATION> and nitric oxide, and iNOS<ORGANIZATION> protein expression. TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines were inhibited significantly ( p < 0.05 ) at 8 and 14 μg ml-1 concentration. αMN at higher doses inhibits the translocation of NFκB<ORGANIZATION> together with suppressing the COX-2 enzymes, but not COX-1. αMN<ORGANIZATION> inhibited the total leukocyte migration, predominantly, neutrophils in vivo. The level of TNFα<ORGANIZATION> and IL-1β was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) reduced in the peritoneal fluids as measured by ELISA<ORGANIZATION> analysis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that αMN<ORGANIZATION> acts well as an anti-inflammatory agent via inhibiting the hallmark mechanisms of inflammation. It can be considered as a potential alternative lead compound. In addition, the current results support the traditional use of this fruit pericarp as a functional food.
