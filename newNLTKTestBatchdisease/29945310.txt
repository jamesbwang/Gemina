 Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) is a versatile pathogen found in many environments and can cause nosocomial infections in the community and hospitals. S. aureus infection is an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across many government bodies, medical and health sectors, and scientific research institutions. In the present study, S. aureus N315<ORGANIZATION> genes that have been shown in the literature to be pathogenic were extracted using a bibliometric method for functional enrichment analysis of pathways and operons to statistically discover novel pathogenic genes associated with S. aureus N315<PERSON>. A total of 383 pathogenic genes were mined from the literature using bibliometrics, and subsequently a few new pathogenic genes of S. aureus N315 were identified by functional enrichment analysis of pathways and operons. The discovery of these novel S. aureus N315<PERSON> pathogenic genes is of great significance to treat S. aureus induced diseases and identify potential diagnostic markers, thus providing theoretical fundamentals for epidemiological prevention.
