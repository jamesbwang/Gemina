 The mortality rate of acute liver failure significantly increases due to fatal septicemia. Inactive rhomboid protein 2 ( iRhom2<ORGANIZATION> ) is an essential regulator of shedding TNF-α by trafficking with TNF-α converting enzyme ( TACE<ORGANIZATION> ). Fisetin<PERSON>, a flavonoid present in various fruits and plants, possesses anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, multi-combination nanoparticles Fe @ Au conjugated with fisetin, iRhom2 small interfering RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( siRNA<ORGANIZATION> ), and TNF-α inhibitor ( FN ) are prepared to examine their effects on fatal septicemia-associated hepatic failure induced by Listeria<GPE> monocytogenes ( LM ) in mice and to reveal the underlying mechanisms. After LM<ORGANIZATION> infection, upregulation of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminease, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, TNF-α, malondialdehyde, H
