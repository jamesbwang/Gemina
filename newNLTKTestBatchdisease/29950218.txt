 To investigate the effect of silencing NSD2<ORGANIZATION> gene by RNA<ORGANIZATION> interference on the proliferation, apoptosis and the alteration of Akt<ORGANIZATION> /mTOR signaling pathway in diffuse large B cell lymphoma OCI-Ly3 cells. The shRNA<ORGANIZATION> targeting NSD2<ORGANIZATION> gene was transfected into OCI-Ly3 cells by lentivirus infection. The NSD2<ORGANIZATION> mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein were detected by real time Q-PCR and Western<GPE> blot, respectively. The cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. The expressions of BCL-2, BAX<ORGANIZATION>, caspase-3, Akt<PERSON>, p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, H3K36me2<ORGANIZATION> were detected by Western<GPE> blot. After transfecting the OCI-Ly3 cells by NSD2-shRNA for 72 h, the expressions of NSD2<ORGANIZATION> mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein both were down-regulated ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), the proliferation rate of cells in NSD2<GPE> shRNA<ORGANIZATION> group was significantly lower than that in control and Neg<ORGANIZATION> shRNA groups ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) ; the apoptosis rate of cells in NSD2<GPE> shRNA<ORGANIZATION> group was significantly higher than that in control and neg-shRNA group ( 30.37±4.22 ) % vs 1.36±0.52 % and 2.17±1.43 ) % ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) ; the expressions of BAX<ORGANIZATION> and caspase-3 were up-regulated, while the expression of BCL-2 was down-regulated ; the H3K36me2<ORGANIZATION> level significantly decreased as compared with control group, no obvious decrease of the total protein level of AKT<ORGANIZATION> was found, but the expressions of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-70S6K were down-regulated. The silencing NSD2<ORGANIZATION> gene can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of OCI-Ly3 cells, their mechanisms may relate with regulating the H3K36me2<ORGANIZATION> level, specifically inhibiting the activivty of AKT/mTOR signal pathway.
