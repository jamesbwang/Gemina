 The complex pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock involves myocardial depression, the pathophysiology of which, however, remains unclear. In this study, cellular mechanisms of myocardial depression were addressed in a clinically relevant, large animal ( porcine ) model of sepsis and septic shock. Sepsis<PERSON> was induced by fecal peritonitis in eight anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and instrumented pigs of both sexes and continued for 24 h. In eight control pigs, an identical experiment but without sepsis induction was performed.
