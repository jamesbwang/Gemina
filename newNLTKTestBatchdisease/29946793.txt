 Nonalcoholic<GPE> fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. It is characterized by the accumulation of triglyceride within hepatocytes. Taurine<PERSON> is a sulfur-containing-Î²-amino acid that is widely distributed in mammalian tissues. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of taurine on the development of hepatic steatosis in a model of NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> in vivo and in vitro. Male<PERSON> C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet ( HFD<ORGANIZATION> ) supplemented with 2 % ( w/v ) or 5 % ( w/v ) taurine for 12 weeks. An in vitro study was performed in HepG2<GPE> cells loaded with fatty acids. Twelve weeks of supplementation with an HFD<ORGANIZATION> increased the hepatic lipid levels and oxidative stress as well as the body weight and liver weight. Taurine<PERSON> significantly suppressed these changes, which was accompanied by a decrease in the hepatic level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS<ORGANIZATION> ). In addition, taurine treatment suppressed the HFD-induced reduction of the enzyme activity of hepatic superoxide dismutase and catalase and the reduction of the hepatic level of reduced glutathione and ATP<ORGANIZATION>. In HepG2<GPE> cells, taurine suppressed the fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation, production of reactive oxygen species and TBARS<ORGANIZATION> level, and amelioration of the fatty acid-induced disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. These results showed that taurine was effective in alleviating hepatic steatosis by reducing oxidative stress. Taurine<PERSON> may, therefore, be of therapeutic value in reducing the risks associated with NAFLD<ORGANIZATION>.
