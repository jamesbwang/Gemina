 Although hypothyroidism is associated with many comorbidities, the evidence for its association with all-cause mortality in older adults is limited. To evaluate the association between hypothyroidism and all-cause mortality in older adults. Population-based retrospective cohort study. National Health Insurance<ORGANIZATION> Research Database in Taiwan<GPE>. After 1:10 age/sex/index year matching, 2029 patients aged â‰¥65 years who received a new diagnosis of hypothyroidism between 2001 and 2011, and 20290 patients without hypothyroidism or other thyroid diseases, were included in the hypothyroidism and non-hypothyroidism cohorts respectively. All-cause mortality was defined as the primary outcome. Cox<PERSON> proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratios ( HRs<ORGANIZATION> ) of mortality. To further evaluate the effect of thyroxine replacement therapy ( TRT<ORGANIZATION> ) on mortality, we divided patients with hypothyroidism into two groups: patients who received TRT<ORGANIZATION> and those who did not. Hypothyroidism<PERSON> was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality ( adjusted HR<ORGANIZATION> [ aHR ] = 1.82, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.68-1.98, p < 0.001 ). Patients with hypothyroidism who received TRT<ORGANIZATION> had a lower risk of mortality than patients who did not receive TRT<ORGANIZATION> ( aHR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.57, 95 % CI = 0.49-0.66, p < 0.001 ). Similar results were obtained after further propensity score matching, in age-, sex-, and comorbidity-stratified analyses. Hypothyroidism<PERSON> was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality in older adults. In patients with hypothyroidism, TRT<ORGANIZATION> was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.
