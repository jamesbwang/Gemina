 Using knowledge- and structure-based approaches, we designed and synthesized reversible chemical probes that simultaneously inhibit the activity of two epigenetic targets, histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferase ( G9a<ORGANIZATION> ) and DNA<ORGANIZATION> methyltransferases ( DNMT<ORGANIZATION> ), at nanomolar ranges. Enzymatic competition assays confirmed our design strategy: substrate competitive inhibitors. Next<PERSON>, an initial exploration around our hit 11 was pursued to identify an adequate tool compound for in vivo testing. In vitro treatment of different hematological neoplasia cell lines led to the identification of molecules with clear anti-proliferative efficacies ( GI50<ORGANIZATION> values in the nanomolar range ). Based on epigenetic functional cellular responses ( levels of lysine 9 methylation and 5-methylcytosine ), an acceptable therapeutic window ( around 1 log unit ) and a suitable pharmacokinetic profile, 12 was selected for in vivo proof-of-concept ( ref 53 ). Herein<PERSON>, 12 achieved a significant in vivo efficacy: 70 % overall tumor growth inhibition of a human AML<ORGANIZATION> ( Acute Myeloid Leukemia<PERSON> ) xenograft in a mouse model.
