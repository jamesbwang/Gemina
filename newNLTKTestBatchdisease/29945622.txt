 With the increasing burden of mental illness globally, it is becoming common for hospitalised patients with chronic medical conditions to have a comorbidity of mental illness. This combination could prolong length of stay ( LOS<ORGANIZATION> ) of this patient cohort. We conducted an investigation in Tasmania<GPE>, Australian<GPE> hospitals to characterise this cohort and assess if co-morbidity of mental illness is a distinguishing factor that generates LOS<ORGANIZATION> variation across different chronic medical conditions. The retrospective study analysed 16,898 admissions of patients with a primary diagnosis of one of five chronic medical conditions: lung or colorectal cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ), type II diabetes, ischaemic heart disease ( IHD<ORGANIZATION> ) and stroke. Data were from July 2010 to June 2015, across four hospitals that collectively cover 95 % of public hospital admissions in Tasmania<GPE>, Australia<GPE>. Descriptive statistics were used to compare characteristics of patients between the scenarios of with and without co-morbidity of mental illness. We used negative binomial regression models to assess whether co-morbidity of mental illness, along with its sub-types, after adjustment for potential confounding variables, associated with LOS<ORGANIZATION> variation in patients of each medical condition. Based on the adjusted LOS<ORGANIZATION> variation, we estimated differences in bed days ' use between patients with and without comorbidity of mental illness. Patients with co-morbidity of mental illness were significantly younger in comparison to patients without mental illness. With each medical condition, patients with comorbidity of mental illness had incurred higher bed days ' use than for those without mental illness. In cancer and stroke cohorts, co-morbidity of mental illness unfavourably affected the LOS<ORGANIZATION> variation by as high as 97 % ( CI: 49.9 % -159 % ) and 109 % ( 78 % -146 % ), respectively. Though mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substances was a dominant sub-type of mental illness across the medical conditions, it contributed significant unfavourable LOS<ORGANIZATION> variation only in the stroke patients i.e. 36.3 % ( CI: 16.2 % -59.9 % ). Mental<ORGANIZATION> illness consistently produced unfavourable LOS<ORGANIZATION> variation. Upskilling of healthcare teams and greater reporting and analysis of LOS<ORGANIZATION> variation for this patient cohort, and the sub-cohorts within it, are necessary to provide improved medical care and achieve system efficiencies.
