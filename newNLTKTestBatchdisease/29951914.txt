 Myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs<ORGANIZATION> ) are clonal disorders characterized by proliferation of one or more elements of the myeloid lineage. Key<PERSON> genetic aberrations include the BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement in Philadelphia<GSP> chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML<ORGANIZATION> ) and JAK2/MPL/CALR aberrations in Philadelphia<GSP> chromosome-negative MPNs<ORGANIZATION>. While thought to be mutually exclusive, occasional isolated reports of coexistence of BCR-ABL1 and JAK2<ORGANIZATION>, and JAK2<ORGANIZATION> with MPL<ORGANIZATION> or CALR<ORGANIZATION> aberrations have been described. Given the paucity of data, clinical characteristics and outcome of patients harboring concurrent Philadelphia-positive and Philadelphia-negative mutations or dual Philadelphia-negative driver mutations have not been systematically evaluated, and their clinical relevance is largely unknown. It is difficult to determine the true relevance of co-existing driver mutations on outcomes given the rarity of its occurrence. In this case series, we describe those patients who had dual driver mutations detected at any point during the course of their disease and characterized their clinical and laboratory features, bone marrow pathology, and overall disease course.
