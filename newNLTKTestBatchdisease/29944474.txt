 To examine in persons with varying degrees of cognitive impairment the relationship between self-reports of cognitive complaints and quality of life ( QOL<ORGANIZATION> ). Older adults ( n=259 ) with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment ( MCI<ORGANIZATION> ), and mild stage Alzheimer disease ( AD ) dementia completed tests of cognition and self-report questionnaires about QOL<ORGANIZATION> and 3 kinds of cognitive complaints: cognitive difficulties, distress from cognitive difficulties, and believing you had more memory problems than most people. Bivariate, multivariable, and multivariate regression analyses assessed relationships between domains of QOL<ORGANIZATION> and each cognitive complaint. Bivariate<ORGANIZATION> and multivariable analyses controlling for severity of cognitive and functional impairment found that cognitive complaints were related to relatively lower quality of daily life ( QOL-AD, Dementia Quality<ORGANIZATION> of Life Scale<ORGANIZATION> ), greater depression ( GDS<ORGANIZATION> ), more anxiety ( BAI<ORGANIZATION> ), higher perceived stress ( PSS<ORGANIZATION> ), and lower general mental well-being ( SF-12 MCS ). Cognitive complaints have robust associations with QOL<ORGANIZATION>. These findings have implications for AD<ORGANIZATION> prevention trials and management of clinical populations.
