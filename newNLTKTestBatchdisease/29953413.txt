 We aimed to explore the mechanism of pramipexole ( PPX<ORGANIZATION> ) actions in the treatment of Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease ( PD ). Genes related to PD<ORGANIZATION> and PPX<ORGANIZATION> were screened through bioinformatics retrieval. The PD<ORGANIZATION> model was constructed by applying 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ( MMP+ ). The RNA<ORGANIZATION> expression levels of circSNCA<ORGANIZATION>,
