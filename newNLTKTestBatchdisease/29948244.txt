 Although the FDA<ORGANIZATION> already has approved two types of drug therapies for Alzheimer<ORGANIZATION> 's disease, in regard to moderate AD<ORGANIZATION>, there is no clear research to support the best choice of drug treatment. The goal of this study was to examine the levels of serum biomarkers in moderate-AD patients and to explore the value of these serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of memantine sensitivity in AD patients who are significantly affected by MEM<ORGANIZATION>. In our study, 177 patients with moderate AD were enrolled and divided into memantine-sensitive AD ( n = 90 ) and memantine-insensitive AD ( n = 87 ) groups. The sera from all patients were collected, and seven serum biomarkers were analysed. Then, 120 patients were used to establish a diagnostic model that was built with a binary logistic regression analysis, and 57 patients were used to validate our model. In addition, the area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve was established. From the seven serum biomarkers, the four serum biomarkers that were selected in to establish the regression model were VEGF<ORGANIZATION>, BDNF<ORGANIZATION>, IL-6 and IL-1β. The ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve of best combined detection was 0.899. The diagnostic ratio of the logistic model was 0.825. This study suggests that the logistic regression model ( LRM<ORGANIZATION> ) and the ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve based on patients ' serum levels of VEGF<ORGANIZATION>, BDNF<ORGANIZATION>, IL-6 and IL-1β is a promising research for diagnosing and choosing the best course of treatment for moderate AD.
