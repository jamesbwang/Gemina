 The stereoselective flavoenzyme D-amino acid oxidase ( DAAO<ORGANIZATION> ) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of neutral and polar D-amino acids producing the corresponding Î±-keto acids, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. Despite its peculiar and atypical substrates, DAAO<ORGANIZATION> is widespread expressed in most eukaryotic organisms. In mammals ( and humans in particular ), DAAO<ORGANIZATION> is involved in relevant physiological processes ranging from D-amino acid detoxification in kidney to neurotransmission in the central nervous system, where DAAO<ORGANIZATION> is responsible of the catabolism of D-serine, a key endogenous co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Recently, structural and functional studies have brought to the fore the distinctive biochemical properties of human DAAO<ORGANIZATION> ( hDAAO<ORGANIZATION> ). It appears to have evolved to allow a strict regulation of its activity, so that the enzyme can finely control the concentration of substrates ( such as D-serine in the brain ) without yielding to an excessive production of hydrogen peroxide, a potentially toxic reactive oxygen species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ). Indeed, dysregulation in D-serine metabolism, likely resulting from altered levels of hDAAO<ORGANIZATION> expression and activity, has been implicated in several pathologies, ranging from renal disease to neurological, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders.
