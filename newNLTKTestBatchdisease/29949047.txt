 Due to the rarity of BRAF V600E<ORGANIZATION> mutation, no randomized study has compared the combination targeted therapy dabrafenib + trametinib with other second-line treatments for advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ). A network meta-analysis ( NMA<ORGANIZATION> ) was conducted to assess the comparative efficacy of treatments among patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC<ORGANIZATION>. Randomized trials of dabrafenib + trametinib, docetaxel, erlotinib, nintedanib + docetaxel, nivolumab, pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and best supportive care as second-line or above treatments for advanced or metastatic NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> identified in a systematic literature review were included in the NMA<ORGANIZATION>. Overall response rates ( ORRs<ORGANIZATION> ) and disease control rates ( DCRs<ORGANIZATION> ) were compared using logit models ; progression-free survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) and overall survival ( OS ) were compared using fractional polynomial hazards models. Dabrafenib<PERSON> + trametinib was linked into the evidence network through a matching-adjusted indirect comparison versus nivolumab. Ten trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the NMA<ORGANIZATION>. Dabrafenib<PERSON> + trametinib, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab were associated with the highest odds of achieving overall response ( 12.2, 1.2, and 0.7 times higher, respectively, compared with docetaxel ). Estimated DCR<ORGANIZATION> was higher for dabrafenib + trametinib, nintedanib + docetaxel, and pemetrexed compared with other treatments. Patients<PERSON> treated with dabrafenib + trametinib, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab had the lowest hazards of disease progression or death during follow-up ( 72, 61, and 29 % lower hazard of progression at 6 months ; 61, 48, and 46 % lower hazard of death at 1 year, respectively, compared with docetaxel ). Dabrafenib<PERSON> + trametinib, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab were associated with higher ORR<ORGANIZATION> and prolonged PFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS<ORGANIZATION> compared with chemotherapy in previously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC<ORGANIZATION>.
