 Metastatic<ORGANIZATION> Crohn<PERSON> 's disease is a rare cutaneous complication of primary Crohn<PERSON> 's disease. It is a granulomatous inflammatory process, similar to the pathogenic mechanism of Crohn<GPE> 's disease, that occurs in sites discontiguous from the gastrointestinal tract. Metastatic Crohn<ORGANIZATION> 's disease can precede the development of Crohn<GPE> 's disease by months to years, and children are more likely to present with metastatic Crohn<PERSON> 's disease in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Given that approximately 30 % of individuals with Crohn<PERSON> 's disease present in childhood, early recognition of extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn<GPE> 's disease such as metastatic Crohn<PERSON> 's disease can aid in timely diagnosis and management of bowel disease. We present data from two pediatric cases of metastatic Crohn<PERSON> 's disease recently seen at our institution in addition to the 61 reported cases of pediatric metastatic Crohn<PERSON> 's disease in the literature. This review article will focus on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and histology of and treatment options for pediatric metastatic Crohn<PERSON> 's disease.
