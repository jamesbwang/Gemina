 As the prevalence of coronary computed tomographic angiography ( CCTA<ORGANIZATION> ), it is meaningful that CCTA<ORGANIZATION> can provide not only the structural details of artery, but also functional information of vessel elasticity. Our aim was to explore the elasticity characteristics of ascending aorta ( AA ), descending aorta ( DA<ORGANIZATION> ), main pulmonary artery ( MPA<ORGANIZATION> ), left pulmonary artery ( LPA<ORGANIZATION> ), right pulmonary artery ( RPA<ORGANIZATION> ), and their relationship between each other using 640 slice-volume computed tomography ( CT ). Furthermore, this study will also observe their relations with age.A total of 42 subjects that were free of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia underwent CCTA<ORGANIZATION> on 640 slice-volume CT and were enrolled in this study. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: Group 1, age < 46 ; Group 2, age â‰¥46. The aortic distensibility ( AD ) and aortic compliance ( AC<ORGANIZATION> ) of aorta and pulmonary artery ( PA ) of each group were compared.The AD and AC<ORGANIZATION> of PA<ORGANIZATION> decreased in the following order: MPA, RPA<ORGANIZATION>, and LPA<ORGANIZATION>. The correlation coefficients of different elastic parameters between different vessels were found to be different. The correlation coefficient of AD<ORGANIZATION> between AA<ORGANIZATION> and DA<ORGANIZATION>, AA<ORGANIZATION> and MPA<ORGANIZATION>, DA<ORGANIZATION> and MPA<ORGANIZATION>, RPA<ORGANIZATION> and MPA<ORGANIZATION>, LPA<ORGANIZATION> and MPA<ORGANIZATION>, and RPA<ORGANIZATION> and LPA<ORGANIZATION> were 0.689 ( P<PERSON> = .000 ), 0.520 ( P<PERSON> = .000 ), 0.393 ( P<PERSON> = .010 ), 0.329 ( P<PERSON> = .033 ), 0.579 ( P<PERSON> = .000 ), and 0.534 ( P<PERSON> = .000 ), respectively. The correlation coefficients of AC<ORGANIZATION> for the 6 groups mentioned above were 0.351 ( P<PERSON> = .023 ), 0.470 ( P<PERSON> = .002 ), 0.249 ( P<PERSON> = .112 ), 0.190 ( P<PERSON> = .228 ), 0.441 ( P<PERSON> = .005 ), and 0.409 ( P<PERSON> = .010 ), respectively. There was an age-dependent decrease of AD<ORGANIZATION> and AC<ORGANIZATION> in AA<GPE>, DA<ORGANIZATION>, MPA<ORGANIZATION>, LPA<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < .05 ), but no difference in RPA<GPE> ( P<PERSON> > .05 ) .The elasticity characteristics of AA<ORGANIZATION>, DA<ORGANIZATION>, MPA<ORGANIZATION>, LPA<ORGANIZATION>, and RPA<ORGANIZATION> could be well shown by 640 slice-volume CT. The elasticity relativity was observed and was different between AA<ORGANIZATION> and DA<ORGANIZATION>, AA<ORGANIZATION> and MPA<ORGANIZATION>, LPA<ORGANIZATION> and MPA<ORGANIZATION>, LPA<ORGANIZATION> and RPA<ORGANIZATION>. An obvious age-related decrease in vascular elasticity was found in AA<GPE>, DA<ORGANIZATION>, MPA<ORGANIZATION>, and LPA<ORGANIZATION>, which should be taken into consideration in clinical trials and treatments for the elasticity-related cardiovascular diseases.
