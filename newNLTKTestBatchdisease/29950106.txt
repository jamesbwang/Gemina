 HIV prevention interventions that reduce sexual risk behaviors among young Black men who have sex with men ( YBMSM<ORGANIZATION> ), the most severely affected population in the United States<GPE>, are critical for reducing disparities in HIV infection. However, there are few theory-based sexual risk reduction interventions designed specifically for YBMSM<ORGANIZATION>. This study tested the applicability of the Integrated Behavioral Model<ORGANIZATION> ( IBM<ORGANIZATION> ), which theorizes that behavioral intentions mediate the relationship between psychosocial constructs and health behavior on condomless anal intercourse ( CAI<ORGANIZATION> ) among YBMSM<ORGANIZATION>. To test key constructs of the IBM<ORGANIZATION>, analyses were conducted with baseline data from the HealthMpowerment<ORGANIZATION> ( HMP<ORGANIZATION> ) randomized controlled trial. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between condom use self-efficacy, norms, attitudes, intentions, and environmental constraints, and CAI<ORGANIZATION>. Mediation analysis was conducted to determine if condom use intentions mediated the relationship between psychosocial constructs ( i.e., condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes ) and CAI<ORGANIZATION>. Overall 55.7 % reported one or more acts of CAI<ORGANIZATION> with a male partner in the past 3 months. Those who reported CAI<ORGANIZATION> in the 3 months prior to the baseline survey reported lower self-efficacy for condom use, lower condom use norms, more negative attitudes toward condom use, and lower condom use intentions at baseline than those who reported no CAI. In mediation analysis, the relationships between CAI<ORGANIZATION> and self-efficacy for condom use ( estimated indirect effect = -0.004 ( SE<ORGANIZATION> = 0.002 ) ), condom use norms ( -0.002 ( SE<ORGANIZATION> = 0.001 ) ) and attitudes toward condom use ( -0.005 ( SE<ORGANIZATION> = 0.002 ) ) were mediated by condom use intentions. This study applied the IBM<ORGANIZATION> to sexual risk behavior among a sample of YBMSM<ORGANIZATION>. Results indicate that the relationships between condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes, and CAI<ORGANIZATION> were mediated by condom use intentions. Future theory-informed interventions should focus on increasing self-efficacy for condom use, condom use norms, attitudes toward condom use, and condom use intentions to reduce CAI<ORGANIZATION> among YBMSM<ORGANIZATION>.
