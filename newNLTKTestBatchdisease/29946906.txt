 Allogeneic<GPE> hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) is most frequently used to treat acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ). Whether patients should routinely receive consolidation chemotherapy before proceeding to transplant after achieving first complete remission ( CR1<ORGANIZATION> ) has been a subject of debate. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the impact of post-remission chemotherapy before allo-HSCT in patients with AML<ORGANIZATION> in CR1<ORGANIZATION>. Six studies including 1659 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled hazard ratio ( HR ) for overall survival was 0.9 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.77-1.05, P<PERSON> = 0.182 ), and the pooled HR for leukemia-free survival was 0.87 ( 95 % CI 0.75-1.0, P<PERSON> = 0.07 ). No survival advantage was observed for post-remission chemotherapy before reduced-intensity conditioning or myeloablative conditioning ( MAC<ORGANIZATION> ) allo-HSCT for AML<ORGANIZATION> in CR1<ORGANIZATION>. The pooled relative risk for relapse incidence ( RI ) was 1.02 ( 95 % CI 0.82-1.28, P<PERSON> = 0.834 ). Post-remission chemotherapy before allo-HSCT did not significantly affect the RI in patients with AML<ORGANIZATION> in CR1<ORGANIZATION>. The analyses revealed no significant benefit of post-remission consolidation chemotherapy in patients who received allo-HSCT. We recommend proceeding to allo-HSCT as soon as CR1<ORGANIZATION> is attained.
