 To intraindividually compare the diagnostic performance of CT<ORGANIZATION> and MRI<ORGANIZATION> in differentiating non-diffuse-type autoimmune pancreatitis ( AIP<ORGANIZATION> ) from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDA<ORGANIZATION> ). Sixty-one patients with non-diffuse-type AIP<ORGANIZATION> and 122 patients with PDA<ORGANIZATION>, who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT and MRI<ORGANIZATION> with MR pancreatography, were included. Two blinded radiologists independently rated their confidence in differentiating the two diseases on a 5-point scale, and the diagnostic performances of CT<ORGANIZATION> and MRI<ORGANIZATION> were compared. The presence of key imaging features to differentiate AIP<ORGANIZATION> and PDA<ORGANIZATION> were compared between CT<ORGANIZATION> and MRI<ORGANIZATION>. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significantly greater on MRI<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.993-0.995 ) than on CT ( 0.953-0.976 ) for both raters ( p≤0.035 ). The sensitivities of MRI<ORGANIZATION> were higher than those of CT<ORGANIZATION> for the diagnosis of AIP<ORGANIZATION> ( 88.5-90.2 % vs. 77-80.3 %, p≤0.07 ) and PDA<ORGANIZATION> ( 97.5-99.2 % vs. 91.8-94.3 %, p≤0.031 ) for both raters, although the difference for AIP<ORGANIZATION> was statistically marginal ( p=0.07 ) for rater 1. In AIP<ORGANIZATION>, multiple pancreatic masses, delayed homogeneous enhancement of the pancreatic mass, and multiple main pancreatic duct ( MPD<ORGANIZATION> ) strictures were observed significantly more frequently using MRI<ORGANIZATION> than CT ( p≤0.008 ). In PDA<ORGANIZATION>, discrete pancreatic mass and MPD<ORGANIZATION> stricture were observed significantly more frequently using MRI<ORGANIZATION> than CT ( p≤0.012 ). The diagnostic performance of MRI<ORGANIZATION> is better for differentiating non-diffuse-type AIP from PDA<ORGANIZATION>, which is due to the superiority of MRI<ORGANIZATION> over CT in demonstrating the key distinguishing features of both diseases. • Imaging differential diagnosis of non-diffuse-type AIP<ORGANIZATION> and PDA<ORGANIZATION> is challenging. • MRI<ORGANIZATION> has better diagnostic performance than CT in differentiating non-diffuse-type AIP from PDA<ORGANIZATION>. • MRI<ORGANIZATION> is superior to CT in demonstrating key distinguishing features of non-diffuse-type AIP<ORGANIZATION> and PDA<ORGANIZATION>.
