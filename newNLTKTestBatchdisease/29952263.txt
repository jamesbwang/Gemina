 Reactive<GPE> oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are collectively called reactive oxygen nitrogen species, are inevitable by-products of cellular metabolic redox reactions, such as oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, phagocytosis, reactions of biotransformation of exogenous and endogenous substrata in endoplasmic reticulum, eicosanoid synthesis, and redox reactions in the presence of metal with variable valence. Among medicinal plants there is growing interest in Crocus<GPE> Sativus L. It is a perennial, stemless herb, belonging to Iridaceae<GPE> family, cultivated in various countries such as Greece<GPE>, Italy<GPE>, Spain<GPE>, Israel<GPE>, Morocco<PERSON>, Turkey<GPE>, Iran<GPE>, India<GPE>, China<GPE>, Egypt<GPE> and Mexico<GPE>. The present study aims to address the anti-toxicant role of Crocus<GPE> Sativus L. in the case of cardiovascular disease and its role towards the cardioprotective role of Crocus<GPE> Sativus L. An electronic literature search was conducted by the two authors from 1993 to August 2017. Original articles and systematic reviews ( with or without meta-analysis ), as well as case reports were selected. Titles<PERSON> and abstracts of papers were screened by a third reviewer to determine whether they met the eligibility criteria, and full texts of the selected articles were retrieved. Our review has indicated that scientific literature confirms the role of Crocus<GPE> Sativus L. as a cardiovascular-protective agent. Literature review showed that Saffron<PERSON> is a potent cardiovascular-protective agent with a plethora of applications ranging from ischemia-reperfusion injury, diabetes and hypertension to hyperlipidemia. Literature findings represented in current review herald promising results for using Crocus Sativus<PERSON> L. and/or its active constituents as a cardiovascular-protective agent and in particular, Crocus Sativus<PERSON> L. manifests beneficial results against ischemia-reperfusion injury, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes.
