 Spring viremia of carp ( SVC<ORGANIZATION> ) is listed as a notifiable viral disease by the World Organization<ORGANIZATION> for Animal Health<PERSON> ( OIE<ORGANIZATION> ). In 2016, the first official SVC<ORGANIZATION> outbreak was detected in the city of Gyeongsan<GPE>, Korea<GPE>. The present study reports the first complete genome analysis of SVC<ORGANIZATION> virus ( SVCV<ORGANIZATION>, ADC-SVC2016-5 ) isolated from leather carp ( Cyprinus<ORGANIZATION> carpio nudus ). The results revealed that ADC-SVC2016-5 has a 11,029-bp genome containing five genes: N, P<PERSON>, M, G<GPE>, and L. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ADC-SVC2016-5 ( accession number MG663512<ORGANIZATION> ), isolated from leather carp, was closely related to genogroup Ia isolates of the Asian<GPE> clade. This report provides additional information for studying the molecular epidemiology and evolution of spring viremia of carp virus.
