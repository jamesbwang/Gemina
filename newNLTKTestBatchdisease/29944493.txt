 Intravitreal injections of antibiotics and anti-inflammatories are used by some cataract surgeons for surgical prophylaxis. To support this prophylaxis, intravitreal triamcinolone-moxifloxacin ( TM ) and triamcinolone-moxifloxacin-vancomycin ( TMV<ORGANIZATION> ) were tested for preventing Staphylococcus<PERSON> aureus ( SA ) endophthalmitis in rabbits. Trademark formulations of TM<GPE> ( 15/1 mg/mL ) and TMV<ORGANIZATION> ( 15/1/10 mg/mL ) were intravitreally injected into seven groups of eight rabbits each ( A-G ). Before intravitreal injection, the vitreous was first challenged with clinical SA endophthalmitis isolates ( 5,000 colony-forming unit ) with varying minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs<ORGANIZATION> in μg/mL ) to moxifloxacin ( denoted by the MIC<ORGANIZATION> at the end of each group listed ): A ) TMV-10, B ) TM-10, C ) Saline-10, D<GPE> ) TM-2, E ) Saline-2, F ) TM-0.032, and G ) Saline-0.032. After 24 hr, the rabbit eyes were graded for clinical endophthalmitis and cultured for viable SA. Rabbits treated with TMV<ORGANIZATION> and challenged by SA<ORGANIZATION> with a moxifloxacin MIC<ORGANIZATION> of 10 μg/mL did not present with endophthalmitis ( 0/8, no eyes with endophthalmitis ). For SA with moxifloxacin MICs<ORGANIZATION> of 10.0 and 2.0 μg/mL, TM<ORGANIZATION> did not prevent endophthalmitis ( 16/16, 100 % of eyes with endophthalmitis ). For SA with a moxifloxacin MIC<ORGANIZATION> of 0.032 μg/mL, endophthalmitis was prevented with TM<ORGANIZATION> ( 0/8, no eyes with endophthalmitis ). All saline-treated eyes developed endophthalmitis ( 23/23, 100 % of eyes with endophthalmitis ). Intravitreal monotherapy with TM<ORGANIZATION> did not provide consistent prevention of SA<ORGANIZATION> endophthalmitis, whereas intravitreal TMV<ORGANIZATION> successfully prevented endophthalmitis because of SA with elevated MIC<ORGANIZATION> values to moxifloxacin. Cataract surgeons need to be aware that vancomycin seems to be essential for intravitreal prophylaxis to cover moxifloxacin resistance.
