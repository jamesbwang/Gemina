 Virus<GPE> infections induce sensitive antiviral responses within the host cell. The RNA<ORGANIZATION> helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene I ( RIG-I ) is a key sensor of influenza virus RNA that induces the expression of antiviral type I interferons. Recent evidence suggests a complex pattern of RIG-I regulation involving multiple interactions and cellular sites. In an approach employing affinity purification and quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified proteins with increased binding to RIG-I in response to influenza B virus infection. Among them was the RIG-I related RNA<ORGANIZATION> helicase DEAD<ORGANIZATION> box helicase 6 ( DDX6<ORGANIZATION> ), a known component of cytoplasmic mRNA-ribonucleoprotein ( mRNP<ORGANIZATION> ) granules like P-bodies and stress granules ( SGs<ORGANIZATION> ). RIG-I and DDX6<ORGANIZATION> both localized to the cytosol and were detected in virus-induced SGs<ORGANIZATION>. Coimmunoprecipitation assays detected a basal level of complexes harboring RIG-I and DDX6<ORGANIZATION> that increased after infection. Functionally, DDX6<ORGANIZATION> augmented RIG-I mediated induction of interferon ( IFN<ORGANIZATION> ) - & beta ; expression. Notably, DDX6<ORGANIZATION> was found to bind viral RNA<ORGANIZATION> capable to stimulate RIG-I. These findings imply a novel function for DDX6<ORGANIZATION> as an RNA<ORGANIZATION> co-sensor and signaling enhancer for RIG-I.
