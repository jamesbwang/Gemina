 Incretin-based drugs are important in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, among the incretin-based drugs, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists ( GLP-1-RAs ) have been reported to cause gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD<ORGANIZATION> ) -like symptoms making it difficult to continue treatment. Therefore, with the aim of clarifying the relationship between incretin-based drugs and GERD-like symptoms, we conducted a pharmacoepidemiological study using the Japanese<GPE> adverse drug event report database ( JADER<ORGANIZATION> ). Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors ( DPP-4-Is ) and GLP-1-RAs were set as the incretin-based target drugs. The reporting odds ratio ( ROR<ORGANIZATION> ) and the information component ( IC ) was used for the detection of quantitative signals. Furthermore, we also compared the time to onset of GERD-like symptoms by log-rank test. GERD-like symptoms were reported in 36 GLP-1-RAs cases ( ROR<ORGANIZATION>: 5.61, 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ): 3.95-7.96 and IC: 2.17, 95 % CI: 1.66-2.67 ) and GLP-1-RAs were detected in the signal. In contrast, DPP-4-Is were not detected in the signal.There was no sex difference with regard to the expression time of GERD-like symptoms by GLP-1-RAs ( log-rank test, The administration of GLP-1-RA had a higher incidence of GERD-like symptoms earlier than the administration of DPP-4-Is. In this study, although we think that further investigation is necessary, and suggest that patients older than 70 years of age who have been administered GLP-1-RAs need earlier attention to address GERD-like symptoms than younger patients.
