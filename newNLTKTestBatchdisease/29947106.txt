 Patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD ) often report that stress aggravates their itch. However, no study has investigated if and how acute stress influences itch sensation and scratching behavior in these patients. We evaluated the impact of acute stress on experimentally induced cowhage itch perception and scratching behavior in 16 healthy subjects and 15 AD patients. The Trier Social Stress Test<ORGANIZATION> ( TSST<ORGANIZATION> ) was used to induce acute stress. The itch sensation, provoked by applying cowhage to the forearms, and off-site scratching behavior ( not directed at the cowhage application site ) were compared before and after performing TSST<ORGANIZATION> or the control condition ( watching a video of landscape scenes ). In AD patients, stress induced by TSST<ORGANIZATION> caused a significant reduction of cowhage-evoked itch but significantly increased off-site scratching behavior. Such changes in itch perception and scratching behavior were not observed in healthy controls. In addition, a significant positive correlation was noted between stress induced by TSST<ORGANIZATION> and clinical severity of eczema. We speculate that psychological stress increase spontaneous scratching in AD patients, which may enhance the vicious cycle of itching and scratching, resulting in aggravation of the skin eczema. These results provide new insights on the mechanism of acute stress-related exacerbation of itch in AD patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
