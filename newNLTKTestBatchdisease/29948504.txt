 Inflammation<GPE> is an integral component of many diseases, including chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). ASC ( apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD<ORGANIZATION>, also PYCARD<ORGANIZATION> ) is the key inflammasome adaptor protein in the innate immune response. Since ASC<ORGANIZATION> specks, a macromolecular condensate of ASC<ORGANIZATION> protein, can be released by inflammasome-activated cells into the extracellular space to amplify inflammatory responses, the ASC<ORGANIZATION> protein could be an important biomarker in diagnostic applications. Herein<PERSON>, we describe the development and validation of a multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry ( MRM-MS ) assay for the accurate quantification of ASC<ORGANIZATION> in human biospecimens. Limits of detection and quantification for the signature DLLLQALR<ORGANIZATION> peptide ( used as surrogate for the target ASC<ORGANIZATION> protein ) were determined by the method of standard addition using synthetic isotope-labeled internal standard ( SIS<ORGANIZATION> ) peptide and urine matrix from a healthy donor ( LOQ<ORGANIZATION> was 8.25 pM, with a ~ 1000-fold linear range ). We further quantified ASC<ORGANIZATION> in the urine of CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients ( 8.4 Â± 1.3 ng ASC/ml urine, n = 13 ). ASC<ORGANIZATION> was positively correlated with proteinuria and urinary IL-18 in CKD<ORGANIZATION> samples but not with urinary creatinine. Unfortunately, the ASC<ORGANIZATION> protein is susceptible to degradation, and patient urine that was thawed and refrozen lost 85 % of the ASC<ORGANIZATION> signal. In summary, the MRM-MS assay provides a robust means to quantify ASC<ORGANIZATION> in biological samples, including clinical biospecimens ; however, sample collection and storage conditions will have a critical impact on assay reliability.
