 Viral infection triggers the innate antiviral immune response that rapidly produces type I interferons in most cell types to combat viruses invading. Upon viral infection, the cytoplasmic RNA<ORGANIZATION> sensors RIG-I/MDA5 recognize viral RNA<ORGANIZATION>, and then RIG-I/MDA5 is transported to mitochondria interacting with VISA<ORGANIZATION> through the CARD<ORGANIZATION> domain. From there, VISA<ORGANIZATION> recruits downstream antiviral signaling pathways molecules, such as TRAFs<ORGANIZATION> and TBK1<ORGANIZATION>. Eventually, IRF3<ORGANIZATION> is phosphorylated and type I IFNs are induced to fight as the first line of defense against viruses. However, it remains unclear how VISA<ORGANIZATION> acts as a scaffold to assemble the signalosome in RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling. Here, we demonstrated Sec13 as a novel component that was involved in VISA-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. The co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Sec13<PERSON> specifically interacts with VISA<ORGANIZATION>. Overexpression of Sec13<ORGANIZATION> increases VISA<ORGANIZATION> 's aggregation and ubiquitination and significantly enhances the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3<ORGANIZATION>, facilitating the IFN-β production. Conversely, the knockdown of Sec13<ORGANIZATION> attenuates Sendai<ORGANIZATION> virus-induced and VISA-mediated IRF3<ORGANIZATION> activation and the production of IFNβ<ORGANIZATION>, thus weakens antiviral immune activity.
