 Productivity of pigs in smallholder systems is affected by high disease burden, most of which might not be obvious, with their epidemiology and impact being poorly understood. This study estimated the seroprevalence and identified risk factors of a range of bacterial and viral pathogens of potential economic and public health importance in domestic pigs in Uganda<GSP>. A total of 522 clinically healthy pigs were randomly selected from 276 pig farms in Masaka<GPE> ( 142 ) and Lira<GPE> ( 134 ) districts of Uganda<GSP> in 2015. Overall the highest animal prevalence was found for Streptococcus<PERSON> suis 73.0 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 67.0-78.3 ) in Lira<GPE> and 68.2 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 62.7-73.4 ) in Masaka<GPE> ; followed by Porcine<GPE> circovirus type 2 with 50.8 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 44.5-57.2 ) in Lira<GPE> and 40.7 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 35.2-46.5 ) in Masaka<GPE> and Actinobacillus<ORGANIZATION> pleuro-pneumoniae, 25.6 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 20.4-31.6 ) in Lira<GPE> and 20.5 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 16.2-25.6 ) in Masaka<GPE>. Mycoplasma<PERSON> hyopneumonia prevalence was 20.9 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 16.2-26.6 ) in Lira<GPE> and 10.1 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 7.1-14.1 ) in Masaka<GPE>, while Porcine<GPE> parvovirus was 6.2 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 4.0-9.7 ) in Masaka<GPE> and 3.4 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 1.7-6.6 ) in Lira<GPE>. Less<PERSON> common pathogens were Influenza A<PERSON>, 8.5 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 5.6-12.8 ) in Lira<GPE> and 2.0 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 0.9-4.5 ) in Masaka<GPE> and Porcine Reproductive<PERSON> and Respiratory Syndrome Virus<PERSON>, 1.7 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 0.7-4.3 ) in Lira<GPE> and 1.3 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 0.5-3.5 ) in Masaka<GPE>. Even less common was Rotavirus A<PERSON> with 0.8 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 0.2-3.0 ) in Lira<GPE> and 0.7 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 0.2-2.5 ) in Masaka<GPE> ; the same was for Aujeszky<ORGANIZATION> virus with 0.4 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 0.7-2.4 ) in Lira<GPE> and 0.0 % ( CI95<ORGANIZATION>: 0.0-0.1 ) in Masaka<GPE>. Co-infection with two pathogens was common and there was a significant association of M. hyo and PCV2<ORGANIZATION> co-occurrence ( p = 0.016 ). Multivariate analysis showed that for S. suis the use of disinfectant reduced odds of sero-positivitey ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.15 ; p = 0.017 ) and pigs less than 6 months were more likely to be infected than older pigs ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 3.35 ; p = 0.047 ). For M. hyo, crossbred pigs had higher odd of infection compared to local breeds ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.59 ; p < 0.001 ). The studied pathogens have high prevalences in smallholder pig production and might be silent killers, thus affecting productivity and a possibility for some pathogens to spill over to humans. Given the limited knowledge of veterinary workers and the poor diagnostic capacities and capabilities, the diseases are potentially usually under-diagnosed. These findings constitute baseline data to measure impact of future interventions aiming to reduce disease burden in the pig production systems in Uganda<GSP>.
