 To investigate the change in nationwide incidence of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery in Korea<GPE> from 2002 to 2013. From a national sample cohort ( n = 1 025 340 ), cases of postoperative endophthalmitis between 2002 and 2013 were identified. From 70,719 cases of cataract surgery, 49 incidents of endophthalmitis were reported, yielding an incidence of 0.069 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 0.051-0.092 % ). Overall, the endophthalmitis incidence decreased from 0.103 % in 2002-2005 to 0.045 % in 2010-2013, corresponding to an annually decreasing time-trend ( 0.902, 95 % CI, 0.827-0.984 ). In diabetic patients, however, the incidence was 0.128 % and did not change ( time trend, 1.015 ; 95 % CI, 0.828-1.245 ). This study revealed the incidence of endophthalmitis decreased during a 12-year period, but remained constant in diabetic patients.
