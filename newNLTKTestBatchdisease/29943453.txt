 Checkpoint<GPE> inhibitors ( CPIs<ORGANIZATION> ) restore the function of effector immunocytes to target and destroy cancer cells. Immune-related adverse events ( irAEs<ORGANIZATION> ) are a consequence of immune reactivation, with unpredictable inflammatory response, loss of self-tolerance, and development of autoimmunity. Adverse events from CPIs<ORGANIZATION> that present as dermatologic toxicities have diverse clinical and histopathologic features. CPI-associated dermatologic toxicities may exhibit histopathologic features of lichenoid dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, and granulomatous/sarcoid-like reactions. Suprabasal acantholytic dermatologic toxicities associated with CPIs<ORGANIZATION> are particularly rare but represent an emerging histopathologic pattern and include lichenoid dermatitis with suprabasal acantholysis/vesicle formation to Grover<GPE> disease ( transient acantholytic dermatosis ). Here, we report two patients who developed suprabasal acantholytic dermatologic toxicities during CPI<ORGANIZATION> therapy. One patient exhibited a CPI-associated autoimmune blistering disease with PNP-like features restricted to histopathology and immunofluorescence, while the other patient had Grover-like lesions. A review of the literature revealed a spectrum of suprabasal acantholytic dermatologic toxicities associated CPIs<ORGANIZATION> that may present as lichenoid dermatitis with acantholysis/vesicle formation, Grover-like eruptions, and lesions with PNP-like features restricted to histopathology and immunofluorescence. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the types of dermatologic toxicities associated with CPIs<ORGANIZATION> to direct appropriate therapeutic strategies.
