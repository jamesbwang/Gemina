 Synovitis<GPE> associated with osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH<ORGANIZATION> ) is responsible for several clinical symptoms. However, the mechanisms underlying synovitis and the inflammatory environment remain unclear. This study analyzed the proinflammatory mediation expression of IL-17 and Th17<PERSON>, which perform key functions in regulating inflammatory processes in the inflamed synovium and peripheral blood in ONFH<GPE>. Synovial fluid from the hips of 23 patients and 5 controls was collected during surgery, and peripheral blood samples were obtained from 34 patients and 9 controls. The expression of IL-17 in the synovium was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the levels of Th17<GPE> and IL-17 in the blood were measured by flow cytometry and ELISA<ORGANIZATION>. Pain<PERSON> assessment was performed for all the patients and controls. An inflamed synovium was characterized by increased leukocyte infiltration and IL-17 expression in comparison with the control. Preoperative levels of Th17<GPE> and IL-17 were significantly higher in the peripheral blood of the ONFH<ORGANIZATION> group than those in the controls. The symptoms were also positively correlated with the Th17<ORGANIZATION> levels of the ONFH<ORGANIZATION> patients. Th17 cells were recruited to an inflamed synovium, and inflammatory cytokine IL-17 was expressed at an increased level in the hip synovium of ONFH<ORGANIZATION> patients, which possibly contributed to clinical syndrome development. Overall, this study will help in identifying new therapeutic strategies for ONFH<ORGANIZATION>, especially the targeting of IL-17 to decrease inflammation and pain. < p > < /p >.
