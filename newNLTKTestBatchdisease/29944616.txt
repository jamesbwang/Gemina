 Tuberculosis<GPE> ( TB ) is a significant opportunistic infection in solid organ transplant recipients ( SOTR<ORGANIZATION> ). There are limited data on TB incidence in transplantation from low prevalence countries as well as on long-term TB specific immune responses. We performed a single-center retrospective review of SOTR<ORGANIZATION> diagnosed with active TB between 2000 and 2015 and further contacted the available patients for a study of long-term T cell responses using an interferon-gamma ( IFN-γ ) release assay and a flow cytometry-based assay. We identified 31 SOTR with active TB for an incidence of 62 cases/100,000 patient-years. 19/31 ( 61.3 % ) patients were diagnosed within the first year after transplant. Nineteen ( 61.3 % ) were born in countries with high TB prevalence and disseminated disease occurred in 22.6 %. No patient had been screened for latent TB infection pretransplant. The majority of patients received isoniazid and a rifamycin as part of multidrug regimen. In addition, 13/29 ( 44.8 % ) patients received quinolones. One-year mortality in this population was 19.4 %. Eight patients were available for long-term immune responses. Of these, all had detectable IFN-γ response by interferon-gamma release assay testing and 7/8 had detectable TB-specific T cells, primarily central and effector T cell responses in the CD4<ORGANIZATION> compartment and terminally differentiated T cells in the CD8<ORGANIZATION> compartment. TB has high incidence in SOTR<ORGANIZATION> even in low-prevalence regions but especially targets patients who originated from TB-endemic countries. Long-term TB-specific T cell responses were found in the majority of patients.
