 MicroRNA-34a ( miR-34a ), as a tumor-suppressive miRNA<ORGANIZATION>, has been found to induce cell apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ). However, the diagnostic and prognostic significance of miR-34a in AML<ORGANIZATION> remains largely unknown. We aimed to explore its associations with clinical characteristics and prognosis of AML<ORGANIZATION> patients. This study detected serum miR-34a level in 117 diagnosed AML<ORGANIZATION> patients and 60 control subjects by using qRT-PCR, and results were compared to clinical features and patient outcome. Since cytogenetically-normal AML<ORGANIZATION> ( CN-AML ) has a good uniformity of cytogenetics and provides a perfect platform for detection of AML<ORGANIZATION> biomarkers, we further analyzed miR-34a expression in 56 CN-AML subjects. We found that miR-34a was significantly downregulated in AML<ORGANIZATION> and CN-AML patients. MiR-34a underexpression was commonly observed in AML<ORGANIZATION> patients with intermediate/poor risk cytogenetic, and M5 subtype. ROC<ORGANIZATION> analysis demonstrated that serum miR-34a could well identify AML/CN-AML patients from healthy individuals. More importantly, miR-34a expression was found negatively correlated with aggressive clinical variable, and served as an independent prognostic indicator. In addition, AML/CN-AML patients with low miR-34a expression displayed shorter overall and recurrence free survival. Altogether, miR-34a might have an application as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator for AML<ORGANIZATION> patients.
