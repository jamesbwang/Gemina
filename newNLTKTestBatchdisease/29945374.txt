 To detect possible pathogenic virus ( es ) in woad ( Isatis<ORGANIZATION> tinctoria ) cultivated at Institute<ORGANIZATION> of Medicinal Plant Development<ORGANIZATION> in Beijing<GPE>, reverse transcription ( RT ) -PCR was performed using total RNA<ORGANIZATION> of symptomatic woad leaves with primers for poty-, polero-, tobamovirus, broad bean wilt virus 2 ( BBWV2<ORGANIZATION> ) and cucumber mosaic virus ( CMV<ORGANIZATION> ). A 657 bp fragment was amplified from symptomatic woad using CMV<ORGANIZATION> primers. Sequencing and BLAST<ORGANIZATION> analysis indicated that this fragment shared 99 % nucleotide identity and 100 % amino acid identity with CMV-Vi isolate. The isolate was named CMV-Isatis tinctorial ( CMV-It ). Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of CP<ORGANIZATION> genes showed that CMV-It clustered with CMV-K and belonged to subgroup I. To our knowledge, this is first identification of CMV<ORGANIZATION> in woad by RT-PCR and the CP<ORGANIZATION> gene was analyzed. This work provided data for research and control of woad mosaic disease.
