 Hepatitis<PERSON> E virus ( HEV<ORGANIZATION> ) is an emerging cause of autochthonous-acute-hepatitis and acute-on-chronic-liver-failure in western countries. Treatment is not routinely used, despite ribavirin has a good antiviral effect. In vitro sofosbuvir inhibits HEV<ORGANIZATION> replication, but clinical data are lacking. We report a case of acute-on-chronic-liver-failure due to HEV<ORGANIZATION> treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin. The treatment was capable of rapidly inducing both HCV<ORGANIZATION> and HEV<ORGANIZATION> viral suppression. In conclusion, although more data are required before firm conclusions could be drawn, the combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in not immunosuppressed patients with acute hepatitis E may be able to clear HEV<ORGANIZATION> infection.
