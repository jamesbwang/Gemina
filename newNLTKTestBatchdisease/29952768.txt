 DNA damaging chemotherapy and radiation therapy are integrated into the treatment paradigm of the majority of cancer patients. Recently, immunotherapy that targets the immunosuppressive interaction between Programmed<ORGANIZATION> Death 1 ( PD-1 ) and its ligand PD-L1 has been approved for malignancies including non-small lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ), melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC<ORGANIZATION> ). ATR<ORGANIZATION> is a DNA<ORGANIZATION> damage signaling kinase activated at damaged replication forks and ATR<ORGANIZATION> kinase inhibitors potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA<ORGANIZATION> damaging chemotherapies. We show here that the ATR<ORGANIZATION> kinase inhibitor AZD6738<ORGANIZATION> combines with conformal radiation therapy to attenuate radiation-induced CD8+ T cell exhaustion and potentiate CD8+ T cell activity in mouse models of Kras-mutant cancer. Mechanistically<PERSON>, AZD6738<ORGANIZATION> blocks radiation-induced PD-L1 upregulation on tumor cells and dramatically decreases the number of tumor-infiltrating T regulatory ( Treg<ORGANIZATION> ) cells. Remarkably, AZD6738<ORGANIZATION> combines with conformal radiation therapy to generate immunologic memory in complete responder mice. Our work raises the exciting possibility that a single pharmacologic agent may enhance the cytotoxic effects of radiation while concurrently potentiating radiation-induced antitumor immune responses.
