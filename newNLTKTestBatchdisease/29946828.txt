 Urinary urge incontinence is a chronic, debilitating condition that is difficult to treat. Patients refractory to standard antimuscarinic therapy often experience recurrent urinary tract infections ( rUTIs<ORGANIZATION> ). The microbiota of these refractory patients with rUTI<ORGANIZATION> remains unexplored. A midstream urine ( MSU<ORGANIZATION> ) sample was collected from patients with refractory urge incontinence and coexistent rUTI<ORGANIZATION> during acute symptomatic episodes. Culture-based diagnosis was performed using routine microbiological methods. Culture-independent profiling was performed using bacterial 16S RNA profiling. E. coli strain typing was performed by amplicon pyrosequencing of the fimH<ORGANIZATION> gene. Over 2 years, 39 patients with refractory urge incontinence and coexistent rUTI<ORGANIZATION> were studied, yielding 9 severely affected cases. These 9 patients were carefully monitored for a further 2 years, resulting in the collection of 102 MSU samples, 70 of which were diagnosed as UTI<ORGANIZATION> ( median of 8 UTIs/woman ). Culture-independent analysis of 38 of these samples revealed the existence of a diverse urinary microbiota. Strain<PERSON> typing of E. coli identified instances of rUTI<ORGANIZATION> caused by the same persisting strain and by new infecting strains. Patients with refractory urge incontinence and coexistent rUTI<ORGANIZATION> possess a diverse urinary microbiota, suggesting that persistent bladder colonisation might augment the pathology of their chronic condition.
