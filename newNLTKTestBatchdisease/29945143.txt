 This subgroup analysis of the RE-ENACT study evaluates the effectiveness of Razumab® ( the world 's first biosimilar of ranibizumab by Intas Pharmaceuticals<ORGANIZATION> Ltd. ) in Indian<GPE> patients with retinal vein occlusion ( RVO<ORGANIZATION> ). The data on patients with RVO<ORGANIZATION> who had received ≥3 injections of Razumab® between January and August 2016 were analyzed. Endpoints were: improvement in best corrected visual acuity ( BCVA<ORGANIZATION> ), and a decrease in central macular thickness ( CMT<ORGANIZATION> ), intraretinal fluid ( IRF<ORGANIZATION> ), and subretinal fluid ( SRF<ORGANIZATION> ) from baseline at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Of 160 patients, the majority ( 61.87 % ) were men. The mean ( ±SE ) BCVA<ORGANIZATION> improved from baseline ( 0.76 ± 0.04 ) to week 4 ( 0.73 ± 0.03 ; p = 0.0656 ), which attained significance at week 8 ( 0.55 ± 0.02 ; p < 0.0001 ) and week 12 ( 0.47 ± 0.02 ; p < 0.0001 ). The mean ( ±SE ) CMT<ORGANIZATION> significantly decreased from baseline ( 447.60 ± 10.91 μm ) to week 4 ( 431.84 ± 10.92 μm ; p = 0.0028 ), week 8 ( 339.28 ± 8.12 μm ; p < 0.0001 ), and week 12 ( 298.23 ± 6.68 μm ; p < 0.0001 ). The proportion of patients with IRF<ORGANIZATION> and SRF<ORGANIZATION> significantly ( p < 0.0001 ) decreased from baseline to weeks 4, 8, and 12 ( IRF<ORGANIZATION>: from 70.63 to 45.63, 39.38, and 30.00 %, respectively ; SRF: from 65.63 to 37.50, 28.13, and 24.38 %, respectively ). A subgroup analysis of branch RVO<ORGANIZATION> and central RVO<ORGANIZATION> showed similar results. No new safety concerns were observed. Razumab® ( biosimilar of ranibizumab ) effectively improved visual acuity and disease outcomes in patients with RVO<ORGANIZATION> in a real-world setting with no new safety concerns.
