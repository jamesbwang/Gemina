 Brain<GPE> connectome research based on graph theoretical analysis shows that small-world topological properties play an important role in the structural and functional alterations observed in patients with psychiatric disorders. However, the reported global topological alterations in small-world properties are controversial, are not consistently conceptualized according to agreed-upon criteria, and are not critically examined for consistent alterations in patients with each major psychiatric disorder. Based on a comprehensive PubMed<ORGANIZATION> search, we systematically reviewed studies using noninvasive neuroimaging data and graph theoretical approaches for 6 major psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, major depressive disorder ( MDD<ORGANIZATION> ), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD<ORGANIZATION> ), bipolar disorder ( BD ), obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD<ORGANIZATION> ) and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD<ORGANIZATION> ). Here, we describe the main patterns of altered small-world properties and then systematically review the evidence for these alterations in the structural and functional connectome in patients with these disorders. We selected 40 studies of schizophrenia, 33 studies of MDD<ORGANIZATION>, 5 studies of ADHD<ORGANIZATION>, 5 studies of BD<ORGANIZATION>, 7 studies of OCD<ORGANIZATION> and 5 studies of PTSD<ORGANIZATION>. The following 4 patterns of altered small-world properties are defined from the perspectives of segregation and integration: `` regularization, '' `` randomization, '' `` stronger small-worldization '' and `` weaker small-worldization. '' Although more differences than similarities are noted in patients with these disorders, a prominent trend is the structural regularization versus functional randomization in patients with schizophrenia. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, preprocessing steps and analytical methods can produce contradictory results, increasing the difficulty of integrating results across different studies. Four psychoradiological patterns of altered small-world properties are proposed. The analysis of altered small-world properties may provide novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders from a connectomic perspective. In future connectome studies, the global network measures of both segregation and integration should be calculated to fully evaluate altered small-world properties in patients with a particular disease.
