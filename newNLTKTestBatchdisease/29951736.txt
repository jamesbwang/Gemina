 Leishmaniasis<GPE> is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases, with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Among the clinical manifestations of the disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by species of Leishmania<GPE> braziliensis, presents wide distribution in Brazil<GPE>. In this work, we performed the cloning, expression, and purification of the enzyme superoxide dismutase of Leishmania<GPE> braziliensis ( LbSOD-B2 ) considered a promising target for the search of new compounds against leishmaniasis. In vitro assays based on pyrogallol oxidation showed that LbSOD-B2 is most active around pH 8 and hydrogen peroxide is a LbSOD-B2 inhibitor at low millimolar range ( IC<ORGANIZATION>
