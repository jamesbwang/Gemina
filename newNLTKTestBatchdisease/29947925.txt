 Alcoholic<GPE> liver disease ( ALD<ORGANIZATION> ) remains to be a worldwide health problem. It is generally accepted that oxidative stress plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of ALD<ORGANIZATION>, and antioxidant therapy represents a logical strategy for the prevention and treatment of ALD<ORGANIZATION>. Nuclear<PERSON> factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 ( NFE2L2<ORGANIZATION> or Nrf-2 ) is essential for the antioxidant responsive element ( ARE<ORGANIZATION> ) -mediated induction of endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase 1 ( HO-1 ) and glutamate-cysteine ligase [ GCL, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione ( GSH<ORGANIZATION> ) ]. Activation of Nrf-2 pathway by genetic manipulation or pharmacological agents has been demonstrated to provide protection against ALD<ORGANIZATION>, which suggests that targeting Nrf-2 may be a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of ALD<ORGANIZATION>. Herein<PERSON>, we review the relevant literature about the potential hepatoprotective roles of Nrf-2 activation against ALD<ORGANIZATION>.
