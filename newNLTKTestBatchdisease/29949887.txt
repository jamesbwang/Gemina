 Fibroblast<GPE> growth factor ( FGF<ORGANIZATION> ) belongs to a large family of growth factors. FGFs<ORGANIZATION> use paracrine or endocrine signaling to mediate a myriad of biological and pathophysiological process, including angiogenesis, wound healing, embryonic development, and metabolism regulation. FGF<ORGANIZATION> drugs for the treatment of burn and ulcer wounds are now available. The recent discovery of the crucial roles of the endocrine-acting FGF19<ORGANIZATION> subfamily in maintaining homeostasis of bile acid, glucose, and phosphate further extended the activity profile of this family. Here, the applications of recombinant FGFs<ORGANIZATION> for the treatment of wounds, diabetes, hypophosphatemia, the development of FGF<ORGANIZATION> receptor inhibitors as anti-neoplastic drugs, and the achievements of basic research and applications of FGFs<ORGANIZATION> in China<GPE> are reviewed.
