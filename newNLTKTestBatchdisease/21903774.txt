 Proton<GPE> pump inhibitors ( PPIs<ORGANIZATION> ) are metabolized by cytochrome P450. CYP2C19<ORGANIZATION> is the main isoenzyme for the majority of PPI<ORGANIZATION>, whereas CYP3A<ORGANIZATION> family is a secondary enzyme for PPI<ORGANIZATION> biotransformation. The aim of the study was to find if Forty-eight gastric or duodenal ulcer patients ( 15 men, 33 women ; mean age 55.0Â±15.3 years, age range 18-91 years ) from Moscow<GPE> region of Russia<GPE> were enrolled. Peripheral venous blood was collected for DNA<ORGANIZATION> extraction, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for We found a connection between In CYP2C19<ORGANIZATION> IMs+PMs, CYP3A<ORGANIZATION> activity was significantly lower than in CYP2C19<ORGANIZATION> EMs and UMs<ORGANIZATION>.
