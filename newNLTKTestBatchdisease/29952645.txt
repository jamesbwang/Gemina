 Adverse<GPE> reactions to local anesthetics are usually a reaction to epinephrine, vasovagal syncope, or overdose toxicity. Allergic reactions to local anesthetics are often attributed to additives such as metabisulfite or methylparaben. True<PERSON> allergic reactions to amide local anesthetics are extremely rare but have been documented. Patients with true allergy to amide local anesthetics present a challenge to the dental practitioner in providing adequate care with appropriate intraoperative pain management. Often, these patients may be treated under general anesthesia. We report a case of a 43-year-old female patient that presented to NYU Lutheran Medical Center Dental Clinic<ORGANIZATION> with a documented history of allergy to amide local anesthetics. This case report reviews the use of 1 % diphenhydramine with 1:100,000 epinephrine as an alternative local anesthetic and reviews the relevant literature.
