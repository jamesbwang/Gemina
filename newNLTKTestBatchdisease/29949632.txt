 Penile<GPE> carcinoma ( PC ) is a rare, highly mutilating disease, common in developing countries. The evolution of penile cancer includes at least two independent carcinogenic pathways, related or unrelated to HPV<ORGANIZATION> infection. To estimate the prevalence, identify HPV<ORGANIZATION> genotypes, and correlate with clinicopathological data on penile cancer. A retrospective cohort study involving 183 patients with PC undergoing treatment in a referral hospital in Goiânia<GPE>, Goiás<PERSON>, in Midwestern Brazil<GPE>, from 2003 to 2015. Samples containing paraffin embedded tumor fragments were subjected to detection and genotyping by INNO-LiPA HPV. The clinicopathological variables were subjected to analysis with respect to HPV<ORGANIZATION> positivity and used prevalence ratio ( PR ), adjusted prevalence ratio ( PRa<ORGANIZATION> ) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) as statistical measures. The prevalence of HPV<ORGANIZATION> DNA in PC was 30.6 % ( 95 % CI: 24.4 to 37.6 ), high-risk HPV 24.9 % ( 95 % CI: 18.9 to 31.3 ), and 62.5 % were HPV<ORGANIZATION> 16. There was a statistical association between the endpoints HPV<ORGANIZATION> infection and HPV<ORGANIZATION> high risk, and the variable tumor grade II-III ( p = 0.025 ) ( p = 0.040 ), respectively. There was no statistical difference in disease specific survival at 10 years between the HPV<ORGANIZATION> positive and negative patients ( p = 0.143 ), and high and low risk HPV<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.325 ). The prevalence of HPV<ORGANIZATION> infection was 30.6 %, and 80.3 % of the genotypes were identified as preventable by anti-HPV quadrivalent or nonavalent vaccine. HPV<ORGANIZATION> infections and high-risk HPV were not associated with penile carcinoma prognosis in this study.
