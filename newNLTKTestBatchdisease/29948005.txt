 To identify baseline characteristics and long-term prognostic factors in non-transplant patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ) who had prolonged survival after treatment with yttrium-90 radioembolization ( Y90 ). Sixty-seven `` Super Survivors '' ( defined as ≥ 3-year survival after Y90<GPE> ) were identified within our 1000-patient Y90 database ( 2003-2017 ). Baseline<PERSON> imaging and follow-up occurred at 1 month and every 3 months thereafter. Overall survival ( OS ) was calculated with Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank test in subgroups: Child-Pugh ( CP ) score, distribution of disease, portal vein thrombus ( PVT<ORGANIZATION> ), and technique ( segmental vs lobar Y90 ). Median<GPE> age 69.5 years ( range 45-94 years ) ; 69 % male ; 60 % solitary HCC<ORGANIZATION> ; 79 % unilobar disease ; 12 % PVT<ORGANIZATION> ; 10 % ascites ; Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage<PERSON> A-54 % /B-28 % /C-16 % /D-2 % ; CP<ORGANIZATION> A-70 % /B-28 % /C-2 %. Longest<PERSON> baseline tumor diameter was 5.4 ± 4.0 cm ( mean ± SD ). All patients had an imaging response ( either partial or complete response ). Median OS<PERSON> was 67.5 months ( 95 % CI 55.2-82.5 ). CP score and main PVT<ORGANIZATION> stratified median OS ( p = 0.0007 and p = 0.0187, respectively ). Beyond 3 years, segmental versus lobar Y90<PERSON> was associated with improved OS with a median OS of 80.2 versus 46.7 months, respectively ( p = 0.0024 ). Dosing > 200 Gy was not a significant predictor of improved OS. Super<ORGANIZATION> Survivors spanning the BCLC<ORGANIZATION> staging system maintained durable OS after radioembolization that was stratified by the extent of underlying liver disease. The common variable among all patients was an imaging response. Segmental<ORGANIZATION> versus lobar Y90<PERSON> may have a long-term associated OS<ORGANIZATION> benefit.
