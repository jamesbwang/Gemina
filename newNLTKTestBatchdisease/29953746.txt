 Mohs<GPE> micrographic surgery ( MMS<ORGANIZATION> ) is the treatment of choice for high-risk primary basal cell carcinoma ( BCC<ORGANIZATION> ) and recurrent BCC<ORGANIZATION> of the head and neck, showing fewer recurrences compared with surgical excision ( SE ). The objectives of this study were to determine the recurrence rate of head and neck BCC after MMS<ORGANIZATION> and to develop a prediction model with significant risk factors for recurrence. A retrospective study of patient records. All BCCs treated with MMS<ORGANIZATION> between 1 January 1995 and 1 July 2013 at the University Medical Center Groningen<ORGANIZATION> ( UMCG<ORGANIZATION> ) were selected retrospectively. Recorded parameters were patient characteristics, tumour size, tumour location, histopathological subtype, previous treatment, the number of stages until microscopic clearance, defect size, adverse events, follow-up time and recurrence after MMS<ORGANIZATION>. The study covered 1021 MMS operations conducted on primary BCCs<ORGANIZATION> ( 57.4 % ), residual BCCs<ORGANIZATION> ( 25.6 % ) and recurrent BCCs<ORGANIZATION> ( 17.0 % ). The median follow-up time was 54.0 months ( ranging from 1 to 221 months ). The 5-year cumulative probability of recurrence was 3.3 %: 2.6 % for primary BCCs<ORGANIZATION>, 5.4 % for residual BCCs<ORGANIZATION> and 2.9 % for recurrent BCCs<ORGANIZATION>. An aggressive histopathological subtype, residual BCCs<ORGANIZATION> and recurrent BCCs<ORGANIZATION> were significant risk factors for predicting a higher risk of recurrence after MMS<ORGANIZATION>. This large-scale retrospective study showed low recurrence rates after MMS<ORGANIZATION> for primary and recurrent BCCs<ORGANIZATION>. Residual BCCs<PERSON> treated with MMS<ORGANIZATION> had relatively higher recurrence rates. The risk of recurrence for MMS-treated residual aggressive BCCs<ORGANIZATION> was more than four times higher than that for primary non-aggressive BCCs<ORGANIZATION>.
