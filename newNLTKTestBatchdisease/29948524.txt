 Limited<GPE> understanding of disease in low resource communities continues to hamper improvements in health. We evaluated household pit latrine sampling as a non-invasive approach to investigate important fecal pathogens such as Giardia<GPE> lamblia and Cryptosporidium<GPE> spp. in impoverished communities where health-seeking behavior limits the sensitivity of health facility-based surveillance. Fecal samples were collected from pit latrines in randomly selected households and from patients presenting to the only hospital in the region during the same time periods. Samples<PERSON> were tested with a commercially available ELISA<ORGANIZATION>. Giardia<PERSON> household prevalence was 28.7 % in 2016 and 48.4 % in 2017, while individual samples from hospital submission had a Giardia<GPE> prevalence of 2.4 % in 2016 and 8.0 % in 2017. Cryptosporidium<PERSON> was only found in one household. Results suggest that pit latrine surveillance for fecal-borne infections provide course estimates of community infection levels that are unbiased by health seeking behaviors and allow surveillance of vulnerable sectors of a population.
