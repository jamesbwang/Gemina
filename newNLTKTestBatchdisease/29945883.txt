 Long noncoding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) regulate gene expression. We investigated the role of lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in the inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the lungs. We identified the lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> MEG3<ORGANIZATION> as a tissue-specific modulator of inflammatory responses during bacterial infection. Among the 10 transcript isoforms of MEG3<ORGANIZATION>, transcript 4 ( referred to as MEG3-4 ) encodes the isoform with the lowest abundance in mouse lungs. Nonetheless, we found that MEG3-4 bound to the microRNA<ORGANIZATION> miR-138 in a competitive manner with mRNA<ORGANIZATION> encoding the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ), thereby increasing IL-1β abundance and intensifying inflammatory responses to bacterial infection in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells in culture and in lung tissue in mice. MEG3-4-mediated sponging of miR-138 in the cytoplasm increased the autocrine activity of IL-1β that subsequently induced a negative feedback mechanism mediated by nuclear factor κB that decreased MEG3-4 abundance and inflammatory cytokine production. This timely reduction in MEG3-4 abundance tempered proinflammatory responses in mice with pulmonary bacterial infection, preventing the progression to sepsis. Together, these findings reveal that MEG3-4 dynamically modulates pulmonary inflammatory responses through transcriptional regulation of immune response genes, extending the decoy and sponge mechanism associated with lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> to antibacterial immunity, which affects both response and disease progression.
