 In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to evaluate whether a value clarification tool enabling patients to view a set of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) treatment preference phenotypes could be used to support shared decision-making ( SDM<ORGANIZATION> ) at the point-of-care. We conducted a pre-post test study. All English-speaking RA patients presenting to their scheduled outpatient visits were asked to participate. Visits for patients with active RA were transcribed. SDM components were measured using a quantitative coding scheme based on an established model of SDM<ORGANIZATION>. Forty-six visits were included in the pre-test and 40 in the post-test phase. Providers offered more DMARDs<ORGANIZATION> ( two or more ) in the post-test visits ( 60 % ) compared to the pre-test visits ( 47.8 % ). Overall, more patients vocalized their values and/or preferences in the post-test visits compared to the pre-test visits for treatment escalation decisions including choice of one new DMARD<ORGANIZATION> ( 90.9 % versus 56.3 % ), two or more new DMARDs ( 95.8 % versus 86.4 % ), as well as prednisone ( 87.5 % versus 66.7 % ). Providers were also more likely to base their recommendations on patients ' values and/or preferences in the post-test ( 100 % of six visits ) than pre-test ( 64.3 % of 14 visits ) phase during visits in which a recommendation was made. The average ( SD ) length of the visit was 29.9 ( 11.6 ) minutes and 25.1 ( 10.7 ) minutes in the pre- and post-test phases respectively. This study provides an early indication that a value clarification tool allowing patients to consider a set of preference phenotypes can support SDM<ORGANIZATION> at the point-of-care without extending visit time.
