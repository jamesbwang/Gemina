 Hepatic<GPE> mitochondrial function ( HMF<ORGANIZATION> ) assessed by the & lt ; sup & gt ; 13 & lt ; /sup & gt ; C-ketoisocaproate breath test ( & lt ; sup & gt ; 13 & lt ; /sup & gt ; C-KICA BT ) has been previously shown to be significantly associated with the severity of biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ). However, it is uncertain whether any perturbation in HMF<ORGANIZATION> relates specifically to severity of liver disease or factors associated with metabolic syndrome within non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ). Our aim was to investigate whether there was any change in HMF<ORGANIZATION> assessed by & lt ; sup & gt ; 13 & lt ; /sup & gt ; C-KICA BT in patients with NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> compared to control subjects, and to assess the factors that are independently associated with HMF<ORGANIZATION>. 77 patients with NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> and 11 healthy control subjects were studied. HMF<ORGANIZATION> was assessed using & lt ; sup & gt ; 13 & lt ; /sup & gt ; C-KICA BT and expressed as cumulative % & lt ; sup & gt ; 13 & lt ; /sup & gt ; C-dose recovered on breath over 1hr ( cPDR<ORGANIZATION> over 1hr ). Liver<PERSON> fat and fibrosis was assessed by transient elastography. Multi-variable linear regression modelling was undertaken to test the independence of associations with HMF<ORGANIZATION>. HMF ( cPDR<ORGANIZATION> over 1hr ) was lower in NAFLD<GPE> compared to controls [ 13.4 % ( 4.8 ) v. 21.0 % ( 6.3 ) ; p & lt ; 0.0001 ) ]. In NAFLD<GPE>, HMF<ORGANIZATION> was lower in patients with diabetes versus no diabetes [ 12.7 % ( 3.4 ) v. 14.3 % ( 6.1 ) ; p=0.003 ) ]. Regression modelling showed age ( β= -0.08 ; p=0.01 ), waist circumference ( β= -0.08 ; p=0.01 ), hip circumference ( β= -0.04 ; p=0.01 ), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST<ORGANIZATION> ) ( β= -0.05 ; p=0.01 ) and diabetes status ( β= -1.81 ; p=0.01 ) were independently associated with HMF<ORGANIZATION> ( R<ORGANIZATION> & lt ; sup & gt ; 2 & lt ; /sup & gt ; = 41.5 % ; p & lt ; 0.0001 ). In patients with NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ( compared to healthy subjects ), there was a reduction in HMF<ORGANIZATION> assessed by the & lt ; sup & gt ; 13 & lt ; /sup & gt ; C-KICA BT. Furthermore, in patients with NAFLD<ORGANIZATION>, HMF<ORGANIZATION> is independent and inversely associated with age, waist and hip circumference, AST<ORGANIZATION> and diabetes status.
