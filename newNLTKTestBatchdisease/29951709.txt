 To analyze the effects of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha ( HIF-1α ) /vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF<ORGANIZATION> ) signaling pathway on villous angiogenesis in early missed abortion. Immunohistochemical assays were performed to detect the expression of micro-vessel density ( MVD<ORGANIZATION> ), HIF-1α, and VEGF<ORGANIZATION> in villous tissue samples from 30 missed abortions and 30 elective abortions in early pregnancy. We further analyzed the correlation between HIF-1α/VEGF and MVD<ORGANIZATION>. HTR8/SVneo cells were cultured under hypoxic ( 1 % ) or normoxic ( 20 % ) conditions, tube formation was investigated, and protein and mRNA<ORGANIZATION> level of HIF-1α/VEGF were determined using western blot and qRT-PCR. Finally, HIF-1α was knocked down with siRNA<ORGANIZATION> introduced into HTR8/SVneo cell line under hypoxia, and HIF-1α/VEGF expression and HTR8/SVneo tube formation were investigated. The expression of HIF-1α, VEGF<ORGANIZATION>, and MVD<ORGANIZATION> was lower in the missed abortion than in the elective abortion group. Correlational analysis showed that the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF<ORGANIZATION> was positively correlated with MVD<ORGANIZATION> in both groups. The levels of HIF-1α/VEGF mRNA and protein in HTR8/SVneo cells were significantly enhanced under hypoxia. HIF-1α knockdown with siRNA<ORGANIZATION> inhibited HIF-1α/VEGF mRNA and protein levels of HTR8/SVneo cells induced by hypoxia. Tube<PERSON> formation of HTR8/SVneo cells was significantly enhanced in hypoxic culture and was inhibited by HIF-1α knockdown with siRNA<ORGANIZATION>. Our results reveal a novel role for HIF-1α/VEGF in regulating villous angiogenesis in early pregnancy and suggest that it may be a novel biomarker for missed abortion.
