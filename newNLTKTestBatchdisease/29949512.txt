 Hashimoto<GPE> 's thyroiditis ( HT ) and celiac disease ( CD ) are commonly associated with type 1 diabetes ( T1DM<ORGANIZATION> ). There is no consensus on screening, however, the American Diabetes Association<ORGANIZATION> ( ADA<ORGANIZATION> ) and the International Society<ORGANIZATION> for Pediatric<PERSON> and Adolescent Diabetes<ORGANIZATION> ( ISPAD<ORGANIZATION> ) recommend testing for thyroid function ( TFT<ORGANIZATION> ), thyroid antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies ( TTG<ORGANIZATION> ) IgA<ORGANIZATION> soon after diagnosis. TFT should be repeated every 1-2 years while TTG<ORGANIZATION> IgA should be tested for within 2 and 5 years. We hypothesize that the rate of HT<ORGANIZATION> and CD in our T1DM<ORGANIZATION> children is lower, so screening may need to be revised to reflect their underlying risk. An Institutional Review Board ( IRB<ORGANIZATION> ) -approved retrospective chart review was conducted on children with T1DM<ORGANIZATION> in the past 10 years. Age, sex, race, A1C<PERSON>, TFT<ORGANIZATION>, thyroid and celiac antibodies were obtained. t-Tests, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression were performed. Of 222 children with T1DM<ORGANIZATION>, with a mean age of 15.8±5.53 years, followed for 6.1±4.0 years, 53 % female, mean A1C 11.1±1.9 % and 87 % African<ORGANIZATION> American<GPE> ( AA ). Three had Graves<PERSON> ' disease ( 1.3 % ), three had HT ( 1.3 % ) and 97 % were euthyroid. TFT were assessed on average every 1.3 years and thyroid antibodies every 2.5 years. Positive thyroid antibody was found in 11 %, negative in 57 % and unknown in 32 %. The positive antibody group had higher mean A1C and TSH<ORGANIZATION>. No biopsy confirmed cases of CD ( 0 % ) were found when screened every 2.3 years. The number of individuals who screened positive for hypothyroid HT and CD<ORGANIZATION> was lower than expected in our population. Further studies are needed to assess the optimal screening frequency for HT<ORGANIZATION> and CD in minority children with T1DM<ORGANIZATION>.
