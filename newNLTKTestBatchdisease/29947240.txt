 We aimed to associate a coronary artery disease ( CAD<ORGANIZATION> ) presence and severity with endothelial dysfunction ( ED ), carotid intima media thickness ( CIMT<ORGANIZATION> ) and Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor<PERSON> ( TFPI<ORGANIZATION> ). ED has a central role in atherosclerosis. CIMT<ORGANIZATION> and TFPI<ORGANIZATION> activity are also related with atherosclerosis and CAD<ORGANIZATION>. In our prospective observational study, 50 patients had CAD<ORGANIZATION> and 30 had normal coronary arteries. Endothelial function was evaluated by endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD<ORGANIZATION> ) and nitroglycerine-mediated dilatation ( NMD<ORGANIZATION> ) measurements. CIMT<ORGANIZATION> and Serum<PERSON> TFPI levels were also measured. TFPI<ORGANIZATION> was a statistically significant determinant between the two groups with an increased level in CAD<GPE> ( + ) group ( 84.9 ± 19.3 vs 70.2 ± 14.7, p = 0.001 ). There was a positive correlation between CIMT<ORGANIZATION> and Gensini<GPE> ( r = 0.34, p = 0.014 ). There was a strong negative correlation between Gensini<ORGANIZATION> and FMD-NMD, statistically significant ( FMD<ORGANIZATION>: r = -0.715, p < 0.001 ; NMD: r = -0.718, p < 0.001 ). We observed that ED<ORGANIZATION>, increased CIMT<ORGANIZATION> and TFPI<ORGANIZATION> levels were associated with CAD<ORGANIZATION>. Additionally, increased CIMT<ORGANIZATION> measurements and decreased FMD<ORGANIZATION> and NMD<ORGANIZATION> values had a positive correlation with GSS<ORGANIZATION> ( Tab<ORGANIZATION>. 4, Fig<PERSON>. 6, Ref<PERSON>. 50 ).
