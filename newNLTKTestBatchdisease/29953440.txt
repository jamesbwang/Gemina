 Mycobacterium<GPE> leprae ( M. leprae ) is a human pathogen and the causative agent for leprosy, a chronic disease characterized by lesions of the skin and peripheral nerve damage. Zoonotic transmission of M. leprae to humans by nine-banded armadillos ( Dasypus<ORGANIZATION> novemcinctus ) has been shown to occur in the southern United States<GPE>, mainly in Texas<GPE>, Louisiana<PERSON>, and Florida<GPE>. Nine-banded armadillos are also common in South America<GPE>, and residents living in some areas in Brazil<GPE> hunt and kill armadillos as a dietary source of protein. This study examines the extent of M. leprae infection in wild armadillos and whether these New World mammals may be a natural reservoir for leprosy transmission in Brazil<GPE>, similar to the situation in the southern states of the U.S. The presence of the M. leprae-specific repetitive sequence RLEP<ORGANIZATION> was detected by PCR<ORGANIZATION> amplification in purified DNA<ORGANIZATION> extracted from armadillo spleen and liver tissue samples. A positive RLEP<ORGANIZATION> signal was confirmed in 62 % of the armadillos ( 10/16 ), indicating high rates of infection with M. leprae. Immunohistochemistry of sections of infected armadillo spleens revealed mycobacterial DNA<ORGANIZATION> and cell wall constituents in situ detected by SYBR Gold<ORGANIZATION> and auramine/rhodamine staining techniques, respectively. The M. leprae-specific antigen, phenolic glycolipid I ( PGL-I ) was detected in spleen sections using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for PGL-I. Anti-PGL-I titers were assessed by ELISA<ORGANIZATION> in sera from 146 inhabitants of Belterra<GPE>, a hyperendemic city located in western Par√°<ORGANIZATION> state in Brazil<GPE>. A positive anti-PGL-I titer is a known biomarker for M. leprae infection in both humans and armadillos. Individuals who consumed armadillo meat most frequently ( more than once per month ) showed a significantly higher anti-PGL-I titer than those who did not eat or ate less frequently than once per month. Armadillos<PERSON> infected with M. leprae represent a potential environmental reservoir. Consequently, people who hunt, kill, or process or eat armadillo meat are at a higher risk for infection with M. leprae from these animals.
