 To assess posterior inflammation using a fluorescein ( FA<ORGANIZATION> ) /indocyanine-green angiography ( ICGA<ORGANIZATION> ) scoring system, and compare them to the presently recommended outcome measure, the standardization of uveitis nomenclature vitreous haze score ( SUN-VH ) in stromal choroiditis. This was a retrospective study on patients with a diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis ( OS ), ocular tuberculosis ( OT ), Birdshot<GPE> retinochoroiditis ( BRC<ORGANIZATION> ) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease ( VKH<ORGANIZATION> ) seen in the Centre<ORGANIZATION> for Ophthalmic Specialized Care<ORGANIZATION>, Lausanne<GPE>, Switzerland<GPE>. Angiography signs were quantified according to an established FA/ICGA scoring system. Vitritis<PERSON> was assessed using SUN-VH. Results were compared. 65 newly diagnosed patients ( 128 eyes ) with stromal choroiditis were included. Angiographic scoring showed variable degrees of choroidal versus retinal involvement ( 87 % for OS<ORGANIZATION>, 72 % for OT<ORGANIZATION>, 62.5 % for BRC<ORGANIZATION> and 100 % for VKH<ORGANIZATION> ). On the other hand, a mere 22 of 128 eyes ( 17 % ) showed a SUN-VH score â‰¥ 2 necessary for inclusion in clinical trials. Moreover, FA/ICGA values followed a normal distribution curve and presented inter-examiner variations greater than 1-SD in only 8.4 % of cases. SUN-VH values ' distribution was non-normal and showed inter-examiner discrepancies greater than 1-SD in 51.7 % of cases. This study highlights the precise measurement of global posterior inflammation achieved by a dual FA/ICGA scoring system in stromal choroiditis. In contrast, SUN-VH scale appears imprecise and inadequate, as only a minute percentage of the studied eyes could have been included in a clinical trial based on this criterion. To evaluate posterior intraocular inflammation meaningfully in stromal choroiditis, the use of dual FA/ICGA is strongly advised and should replace the presently recommended SUN-VH system.
