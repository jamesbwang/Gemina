 Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR<ORGANIZATION> ) estimation equations using creatinine and Cystatin-C appear to be superior to those based on creatinine or Cystatin-C in older adults. We sought to compare the performances of those based on creatinine and Cystatin-C in Chinese<GPE> older adults with chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). A total of 368 Chinese<GPE> elderly with CKD<ORGANIZATION> underwent the dynamic imaging with technetium- Four equations overestimated GFR<ORGANIZATION> except for BIS-2 equation in mGFR<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m BIS-2 equation may be optimal for Chinese<GPE> older adults with CKD<ORGANIZATION> especially in older adults ≥ 75 years and with mGFR<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m
