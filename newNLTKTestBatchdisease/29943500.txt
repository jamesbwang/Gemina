 Natural<GPE> killer cells are thought to influence the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT<ORGANIZATION> ), impacting on relapse, overall survival, graft versus host disease and the control of infection, in part through the complex interplay between the large and genetically diverse killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ( KIR<ORGANIZATION> ) family and their ligands. This study examined the relationship between KIR<ORGANIZATION> gene content and clinical outcomes including the control of opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus in the setting of human leucocyte antigen ( HLA<ORGANIZATION> ) -matched sibling HSCT<ORGANIZATION> in an Australian<GPE> cohort. The presence of the KIR<ORGANIZATION> B haplotype which contain more activating receptors in the donor, in particular centromeric B haplotype genes ( Cen-B ), was associated with improved overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ) undergoing sibling HSCT<ORGANIZATION> and receiving myeloablative conditioning. Donor<PERSON> Cen-B haplotype was also associated with reduced acute graft versus host disease grades II-IV whereas donor telomeric-B haplotype was associated with decreased incidence of CMV<ORGANIZATION> reactivation. In contrast, we were not able to demonstrate a reduced rate of relapse when the donor had KIR<ORGANIZATION> Cen-B, however relapse with a donor Cen-A haplotype was a competing risk factor to poor overall survival. Here we show that the presence of donor activating KIR<ORGANIZATION> led to improved outcome for the patient, potentially through reduced relapse rates and decreased incidence of acute GvHD<ORGANIZATION> translating to improved overall survival.
