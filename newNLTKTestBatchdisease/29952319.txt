 Definition of the clinical target volume ( CTV<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the weakest links in the radiation therapy chain. In particular, inability to account for uncertainties is a severe limitation in the traditional CTV<ORGANIZATION> delineation approach. Here, we introduce and test a new concept for tumor target definition, the clinical target distribution ( CTD<ORGANIZATION> ). The CTD<ORGANIZATION> is a continuous distribution of the probability of voxels to be tumorous. We describe an approach to incorporate the CTD<ORGANIZATION> in treatment plan optimization algorithms, and implement it in a commercial treatment planning system. We test the approach in two synthetic and two clinical cases, a sarcoma and a glioblastoma case. The CTD<ORGANIZATION> is straightforward to implement in treatment planning and comes with several advantages: it allows to find the most suitable tradeoff between target coverage and sparing of surrounding healthy organs at the treatment planning stage, without having to modify or redraw a CTV<ORGANIZATION>. Owing to the variable probabilities afforded by the CTD<ORGANIZATION>, a more flexible and more clinically meaningful sparing of critical structure becomes possible. Finally, the CTD<ORGANIZATION> is expected to reduce the inter-user variability of defining the traditional CTV<ORGANIZATION>.
