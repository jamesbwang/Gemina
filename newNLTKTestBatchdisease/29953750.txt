 This study examined the association between Macrophage Migration Inhibitory<ORGANIZATION> Factor ( MIF<ORGANIZATION> ) promoter polymorphisms and granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( GPA<ORGANIZATION> ), and MIF<ORGANIZATION> 's role in a murine model of granulomatous vasculitis. The human study involved 1077 patients with GPA<ORGANIZATION> and controls. Genotyping for the MIF<ORGANIZATION> -794 CATT The percentage of individuals carrying > 5 CATT<ORGANIZATION> repeats in each MIF allele ( high MIF<ORGANIZATION> expressers ) was 60.9 % in patients with GPA<ORGANIZATION> and 53.7 % in controls ( adjusted p=0.049 ). Human MIF<PERSON> gene expression increased proportionally by CATT-length in response to granulomatous stimulation. Mif lung-Tg2.1 mice exhibited more pulmonary granulomas than WT<ORGANIZATION>, which in turn showed more granulomas than Mif-KO. A significantly higher percentage of Mif<ORGANIZATION> lung-Tg2.1 mice died when injected with CAG<ORGANIZATION> when compared to Mif-KO or WT, and anti-MIF protected against lethal disease. MIF-dependent neutrophil/macrophage chemokines were elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage or plasma of Mif<ORGANIZATION> lung-Tg2.1 mice. Patients with GPA<ORGANIZATION> have an increased frequency of high-expression MIF<ORGANIZATION> CATT alleles. Higher MIF<ORGANIZATION> expression increased mortality and pulmonary granulomas while anti-MIF protected mice from lethal disease. MIF<ORGANIZATION> blockade in high genotypic MIF<ORGANIZATION> expressers may offer a selective pharmacologic therapy for GPA<ORGANIZATION>. This article is protected by copyright.
