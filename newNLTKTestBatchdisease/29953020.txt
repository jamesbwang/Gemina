 The aim of the study was to review the distribution, current trends, and microbiological characteristics of bacterial pathogens isolated from dacryocystitis patients in China<GPE> during the last 15 years.This is a retrospective multiple-center noncomparative case series. The medical records of 15,452 consecutive patients from 7 cities diagnosed as having dacryocystitis between 2002 and 2016 were reviewed. The patients ' demographics, microbiological data, and antibiotic sensitivity were reviewed and analyzed.A total of 3344 lacrimal sac content cultures were taken ( 21.6 % ) during the study period. A pathogen was identified in 1996 samples ( 59.7 % ), with bacterial isolates accounting for 1902 of the positive cultures ( 95.3 % ). Gram-positive isolates, gram-negative isolates, and anaerobic bacteria were found in 1218 ( 61.0 % ), 607 ( 30.4 % ), and 285 ( 14.3 % ) samples, respectively. An increase in gram-positive isolates over the study duration was found ( P<PERSON> = .003 ). The predominant isolates were coagulase negative Staphylococci ( 485, 25.5 % ), Staphylococcus<PERSON> aureus ( 186, 9.8 % ), Pseudomonas<GPE> aeruginosa ( 184, 9.7 % ), and Haemophilus<GPE> influenzae ( 152, 9.0 % ). There was a trend toward increasing resistance to erythromycin from 10.5 % during the first 5 years of the study to 20.7 % during the last 5 years ( P<PERSON> < .001 ). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that gatifloxacin was the most effective drug against most of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria.The microbial culture rate of dacryocystitis in China<GPE> is low. There was an increase in the percentage of gram-positive bacteria over time. The sensitivity of gram-positive isolates to tested antibiotics is relatively low compared with that of gram-negative isolates. Our data show that the empiric use of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones in refractory dacryocystitis may be justified.
