 Atherosclerosis<GPE> is considered as a multifactorial disease in terms of the pathogenic mechanisms. Oxidative stress has been implicated in atherogenesis, and the putative mechanisms of its action include oxidative modification of redox-sensitive signaling factors. High mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1<ORGANIZATION> ) is a key inflammatory mediator in atherosclerosis, but if oxidized it loses its activity. Thus, whether and how it participates in oxidative stress-induced atherosclerosis are not clear. The current study found that exogenous HMGB1<ORGANIZATION> dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of multipotent vascular stem cells and their differentiation to smooth muscle cells induced by platelet-derived growth factor. But oxidative modification impaired the activity of HMGB1<ORGANIZATION> to produce the effect. The stem cells were regarded as the source of smooth muscle cells in vascular remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia. Therefore, the findings suggested that HMGB1<ORGANIZATION> participated in oxidative stress-induced atherosclerosis presumably by targeting multipotent vascular stem cells.
