 The respiratory epithelium is a barrier against pathogens and allergens and a target for therapy in respiratory allergy, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ). We investigated barrier-damaging factors and protective factors by real-time measurement of respiratory cell barrier integrity. Barrier<PERSON> integrity to cigarette smoke extract ( CSE<ORGANIZATION> ), house dust mite ( HDM<ORGANIZATION> ) extract, interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) or human rhinovirus ( HRV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection alone or in combination was assessed. Corticosteroids<PERSON>, lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION> ), and nasal mucus proteins were tested for their ability to prevent loss of barrier integrity. Real-time impedance-based measurement revealed different patterns of CSE-, HDM-, IFN-γ- and HRV-induced damage. When per se non-damaging concentrations of harmful factors were combined, a synergetic effect was observed only for CSE<ORGANIZATION> and HDM<ORGANIZATION>. Betamethasone<PERSON> prevented the damaging effect of HRV<ORGANIZATION> and CSE<ORGANIZATION>, but not damage caused by HDM<ORGANIZATION> or IFN-γ. Real-time impedance-based measurement of respiratory epithelial barrier function is useful to study factors, which are harmful or protective. The identification of a synergetic damaging effect of CSE<ORGANIZATION> and HDM<ORGANIZATION> as well as the finding that Betamethasone<GPE> protects against HRV- and CSE-induced damage may be important for asthma and COPD<ORGANIZATION>.
