 The Mediterranean Diet<ORGANIZATION> ( MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> ) has been acknowledged as a healthy diet. However, its relation with risk of major chronic diseases in non-Mediterranean countries is inconclusive. The Nordic<GPE> diet is proposed as an alternative across Northern Europe<GPE>, although its associations with the risk of chronic diseases remain controversial. We aimed to investigate the association between the Nordic<GPE> diet and the MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> with the risk of chronic disease ( type 2 diabetes ( T2D ), myocardial infarction ( MI ), stroke, and cancer ) in the EPIC-Potsdam cohort. The EPIC-Potsdam cohort recruited 27,548 participants between 1994 and 1998. After exclusion of prevalent cases, we evaluated baseline adherence to a score reflecting the Nordic<GPE> diet and two MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> scores ( tMDS<ORGANIZATION>, reflecting the traditional MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> score, and the MedPyr<ORGANIZATION> score, reflecting the MedDiet Pyramid<ORGANIZATION> ). Cox<PERSON> regression models were applied to examine the association between the diet scores and the incidence of major chronic diseases. During a follow-up of 10.6 years, 1376 cases of T2D<GPE>, 312 of MI<ORGANIZATION>, 321 of stroke, and 1618 of cancer were identified. The Nordic<GPE> diet showed a statistically non-significant inverse association with incidence of MI in the overall population and of stroke in men. Adherence to the MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> was associated with lower incidence of T2D<GPE> ( HR<ORGANIZATION> per 1 SD 0.93, 95 % CI 0.88-0.98 for the tMDS<ORGANIZATION> score and 0.92, 0.87-0.97 for the MedPyr<ORGANIZATION> score ). In women, the MedPyr<ORGANIZATION> score was also inversely associated with MI<ORGANIZATION>. No association was observed for any of the scores with cancer. In the EPIC-Potsdam cohort, the Nordic<GPE> diet showed a possible beneficial effect on MI in the overall population and for stroke in men, while both scores reflecting the MedDiet<ORGANIZATION> conferred lower risk of T2D<GPE> in the overall population and of MI in women.
