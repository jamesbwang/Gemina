 Modern<GPE> molecular techniques have highlighted the presence of inflammation throughout the spectrum of tendinopathy. Previous studies have suggested that excessive inflammation in the tendon is a major factor leading to poor clinical treatment. Furthermore, the NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> inflammasome, as a new term, is closely associated with the pathogenesis of many diseases. In the present study, we examined whether the NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> inflammasome contributes to the development of tendinitis and whether cyclic stretching plays a prominent role in inflammation in the tendon. In the present study, we showed that hydrogen peroxide ( H
