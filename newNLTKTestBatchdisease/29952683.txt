 Exercises in motor development positions are employed in order to activate correct muscular patterns but the effects on the activity of antagonist muscle pairs remain unknown. To determine the effect of using exercises in motor development positions on the activity of antagonist muscle pairs. Another aim was to analyze if introducing some facilitators modifies the muscle activity in the different studied positions. Controlled laboratory study using a single-group repeated measures design. Twenty-one right-handed, healthy adults aged over 41 years ( 10 males and 11 females ). Workers of different departments at Maz Hospital<ORGANIZATION>. Surface electromyography activity of muscle antagonist pairs Upper Trapezius<PERSON> / Lower Trapezius<PERSON>, Serratus Anterior<PERSON> / Pectoralis Major and External Abdominal Oblique<ORGANIZATION> / Lumbar Paraspinal<PERSON> was measured in three positions: rest ( supine decubitus ), reflex turning 1 ( RT1<ORGANIZATION> ) and Modified VÃ¶jta<PERSON> 's first position ( V1stP<ORGANIZATION> ). Primary outcomes were mean normalized RMS<ORGANIZATION> ( averaged over two repetitions ) of EMG<ORGANIZATION> signals of antagonist muscle pairs in the three analyzed positions. Intraclass<ORGANIZATION> correlation coefficients, ICC<ORGANIZATION> > 0.70 ( model 3,2 ), type consistency and 95 % CI was used to estimate the reliability and as exclusion criteria of measurements. Analyzed positions had a significant effect on the activity of the muscles P<PERSON> < .001. There was a significant increase in the activity of the phasic musculature versus its tonic antagonists, except in the case of the external oblique / lumbar paraspinal in V1stP<GPE>. Adding possible facilitators such as gaze, breathing or the combination of both did not show significant changes in the level of activation of the studied muscle groups. Ontogenetic developmental positions can be used to facilitate and improve the activation of phasic muscles.
