 Matrikines are bioactive fragments of the extracellular matrix ( ECM<ORGANIZATION> ) that are fundamental in regulating a diverse array of physiological processes. The tripeptide Proline-Glycine-Proline ( PGP<ORGANIZATION> ) is a collagen-derived matrikine that has classically been described as a neutrophil chemoattractant. In this article, we describe our current understanding of the pathways that generate, degrade and modify PGP<ORGANIZATION> to dictate its bioavailability and stability. Additionally, we discuss our expanding appreciation of the capacity of PGP<ORGANIZATION> to regulate diverse cell types and biological processes, independent of its activity on neutrophils, including a putative role in wound repair. We argue that PGP<ORGANIZATION> functions as a primitive and conserved damage-associated molecular pattern, which is generated during infection or injury and subsequently acts to shape ensuing inflammatory and repair processes. As a fragment of the ECM<ORGANIZATION> that accumulates at the epicentre of the action, PGP<ORGANIZATION> is perfectly positioned to focus neutrophils to the exact site required and direct a localised repair response. However, it is essential that PGP<ORGANIZATION> is efficiently degraded, as if this matrikine is allowed to persist then pathology can ensue. Accordingly, we discuss how this pathway is subverted in chronic lung diseases giving rise to persistent inflammation and pathological tissue remodelling.
