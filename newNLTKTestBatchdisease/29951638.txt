 The long-term incidence of acute appendicitis has been reported to be declining in Europe<GPE> and North America<GPE>. Recent reports, however, indicate stabilized or even increased rates. The aim of this study was to investigate the present epidemiology of acute appendicitis and appendicectomy in a population-based cohort of Swedish<GPE> children. The Swedish National Patient<ORGANIZATION> Register was queried for all children with acute appendicitis and/or appendicectomy in 1987-2013. Population-based incidence rates were calculated. Rates were age- and sex-adjusted, and analysed for temporal and regional trends. Some 56 774 children with acute appendicitis were identified, of whom 53 478 ( 94·2 per cent ) underwent appendicectomy. The incidence rate of acute appendicitis declined by 43·7 per cent over 26 years, from 177·7 to 100·1 per 100 000 person-years between 1987 and 2013. The most significant reduction was for non-perforated appendicitis, from 138·5 to 68·4 per 100 000 person-years between 1987 and 2009. The incidence rate of perforated appendicitis decreased from 28·0 to 19·9 per 100 000 person-years and negative appendicectomies reduced from 48·5 to 3·6 per 100 000 person-years during the study interval. The incidence rates of acute appendicitis and negative appendicectomy have reduced markedly in Swedish<GPE> children over time, with significantly different trends amongst non-perforated appendicitis and perforated appendicitis. The full explanation for the observed findings is unclear.
