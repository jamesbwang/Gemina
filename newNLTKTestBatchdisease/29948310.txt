 Limited<GPE> health literacy has been associated with adverse outcomes in children. We evaluated this association in the setting of chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). We assessed the parental health literacy of 367 children enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease<ORGANIZATION> in Children<GPE> ( CKiD<ORGANIZATION> ) Study<PERSON>, using the Short Test<ORGANIZATION> of Functional Health Literacy<ORGANIZATION> ( STOFHLA<ORGANIZATION> ). We evaluated the association between parental health literacy and CKD<ORGANIZATION> progression, defined as time to the composite event of renal replacement therapy ( RRT<ORGANIZATION>, dialysis, or kidney transplant ) or 50 % decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ). Median<PERSON> CKiD<ORGANIZATION> participant age was 9.5 years, 63 % were male, and 59 % non-Hispanic white. Median<GPE> eGFR<ORGANIZATION> at baseline was 63 ml/min/1.73 m In this cohort of children with CKD<ORGANIZATION>, higher parental health literacy was associated with a nearly 30 % longer time to the composite CKD<ORGANIZATION> progression outcome.
