 Coronary heart disease ( CHD<ORGANIZATION> ) and mental illness are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Decades of research has revealed several, and sometimes surprising, links between CHD<ORGANIZATION> and mental illness, and has even suggested that both may actually cause one another. However, the precise nature of these links has not yet been clearly established. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to comprehensively review and discuss the state-of-the-art nature of the epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects of the bidirectional links between mental illness and CHD<ORGANIZATION>. This review demonstrates that there exists a large body of epidemiological prospective data showing that people with severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, as a group, have an increased risk of developing CHD<ORGANIZATION>, compared with controls [ adjusted hazard ratio ( adjHR<ORGANIZATION> ) =1.54 ; 95 % CI: 1.30-1.82,
