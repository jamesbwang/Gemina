 Relapsed Philadelphia<GSP> chromosome ( Ph ) positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia<PERSON> ( ALL<ORGANIZATION> ) is an aggressive lymphoid malignancy with a poor prognosis and no randomized studies demonstrating superiority of any single salvage regimen. We present the case of a 33-year-old woman with relapsed Ph positive precursor ( pre ) B-cell ALL with rapidly rising peripheral blasts while on blinatumomab monotherapy initially, but ultimately responded with the addition of Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection<PERSON> ( VSLI<ORGANIZATION> ). Ponatinib<PERSON> was added later when it became available for the patient, and she ultimately achieved a complete remission. Further<PERSON> study is warranted to explore mechanisms of potential synergy, and the safety and efficacy of the combination of blinatumomab and VSLI<ORGANIZATION>.
