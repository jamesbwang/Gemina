 The present study aims to develop a method for rapid diagnosis of malaria using loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP<ORGANIZATION> ) combined with a lateral flow device ( LFD<ORGANIZATION> ). By adding the biotin-labeled and FAM-labeled loop primers to the LAMP<ORGANIZATION> reaction solution, the end product can be visualized on a lateral flow dipstick. The entire procedure takes approximately 42 minutes to complete, LAMP<ORGANIZATION> assay exhibited high sensitivity, as the detection limit was 0.01 pg/Î¼L for all five
