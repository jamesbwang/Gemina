 Acute<GPE> kidney injury ( AKI<ORGANIZATION> ) is a contributing factor in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). Despite rapid progresses, the mechanism underlying AKI- CKD transition remains largely unclear. Animal models recapitulating this process are crucial to the research of the pathophysiology of AKI-CKD transition and the development of effective therapeutics. In this review, we present the commonly used rodent models of AKI-CKD transition, including bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury ( bIRI<ORGANIZATION> ), unilateral IRI<ORGANIZATION> ( uIRI<ORGANIZATION> ), unilateral IRI<ORGANIZATION> with contralateral nephrectomy ( uIRIx<ORGANIZATION> ), multiple episodes of IRI<ORGANIZATION>, and repeated treatment of low dose cisplatin, diphtheria toxin, aristolochic acid or folic acid. The main merits and pitfalls of these models are also discussed. This review provides helpful information for establishing reliable and clinically relevant models for studying post-AKI development of chronic renal pathologies and the progression to CKD<ORGANIZATION>.
