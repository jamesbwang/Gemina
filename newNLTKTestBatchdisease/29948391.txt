 Staphylococcus<PERSON> aureus bloodstream infections ( SABIs<ORGANIZATION> ) represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. In this study, we compared infection characteristics and evaluated epidemiology and risk factors associated to SABIs<ORGANIZATION> and 30-day attributable mortality in cancer patients. Clinical<PERSON> and microbiological data from patients with cancer and positive blood cultures for S. aureus were retrieved during a 10-year period at an oncology reference center. Analyses were performed according to type of malignancy and infection with methicillin-resistant<ORGANIZATION> S. aureus ( MRSA<ORGANIZATION> ). Data<PERSON> was evaluated using competing risk analyses to identify risk factors associated to 30-day mortality and used to create a point system for mortality risk stratification. We included 450 patients and MRSA<ORGANIZATION> was documented in 21.1 %. Hospital-acquired infection, healthcare-associated pneumonia, and type-2 diabetes were associated to MRSA<ORGANIZATION>. In patients with hematologic malignancies, MRSA<ORGANIZATION> was more frequent if hospital-acquired, but less likely in primary bacteremia. Variables associated to mortality included abdominal source of infection, hematologic malignancy, MRSA<ORGANIZATION>, glucose levels > 140 mg/dL, and infectious endocarditis ; catheter removal and initiation of adequate treatment within 48 h of positive blood culture were protective factors. From our designed mortality prediction scale, patients with a score > 3 had a 70.23 % ( 95 % CI 47.2-85.3 % ) probability of infection-related death at 30 days. SABIs are a significant health burden for cancer patients. Risk factors for SABI-related mortality in this population are varied and impose a challenge for management to improve patient 's outcomes. Risk<PERSON> stratification might be useful to evaluate 30-day mortality risk.
