 Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease in adults characterized by the deposition of extracellular plaques of β-amyloid protein ( Aβ ), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles ( NFTs<ORGANIZATION> ), synaptic loss and neuronal apoptosis. AD has a strong and complex genetic component that involving into multiple genes. With recent advances in whole-exome sequencing ( WES<ORGANIZATION> ) and whole-genome sequencing ( WGS<ORGANIZATION> ) technology,
