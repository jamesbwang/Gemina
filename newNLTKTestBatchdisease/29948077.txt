 To assess the ability of renal blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD<ORGANIZATION> ) MRI<ORGANIZATION> metrics to predict post-operative renal function. We studied 152 patients who underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy ( LPN<ORGANIZATION> ) and renal MRI<ORGANIZATION> examination including BOLD<ORGANIZATION>. Short-term and long-term renal function was evaluated using the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR<ORGANIZATION> ) derived from renal scintigraphy. Renal function decline was assessed as the absolute decline ( AD ), percentage decline ( PD ) and optimal renal function preservation ( OP ). T2* values were analysed in the renal cortex and medulla ipsilateral and contralateral to the tumour. Clinical<PERSON> characteristics and imaging metrics were evaluated using univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. Risk factors obtained using BOLD<ORGANIZATION> metrics ( determined by multivariate regression ) were then combined and compared with RENAL<ORGANIZATION> scores to predict OP. Increasing warm ischaemia time ( WIT<ORGANIZATION> ), resected and ischaemic volume ( RAIV<ORGANIZATION> ), larger tumour size, higher RENAL<ORGANIZATION> score and lower preoperative GFR were short-term risk factors for AD<ORGANIZATION>, while increasing WIT<ORGANIZATION> and lower preoperative GFR were significant for long-term outcomes. Increasing WIT<ORGANIZATION>, RAIV<ORGANIZATION>, lower T2* value in the cortex and higher T2* value in the medulla on the ipsilateral side were short-term risk factors for PD<ORGANIZATION>, while all of the above factors ( except WIT<ORGANIZATION> and RAIV<ORGANIZATION> ) were significant for long-term outcomes. The performance of the combination of T2* values in the cortex and medulla on the ipsilateral side to tumour in predicting OP<ORGANIZATION> was better than RENAL<ORGANIZATION> score ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> 0.762 vs 0.634, p = 0.013 ). Renal BOLD-MRI metrics could provide useful information to the clinician in predicting post-operative renal function outcomes. • Renal fMRI metrics may be useful for prediction of renal functional outcomes and merit further study. • Renal fMRI<ORGANIZATION> metrics may reflect degree of baseline disease and ability to tolerate warm ischaemia. • Combination of T2* values was better than RENAL<ORGANIZATION> score for predicting OP.
