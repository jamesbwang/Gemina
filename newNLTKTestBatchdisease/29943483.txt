 The implications of the preoperative biliary drain on morbidity and mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy are still controversial. The study aims to assess the impact of the preoperative biliary drain on postoperative outcome and to define the optimal serum bilirubin cut-off to recommend biliary drainage in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy. All consecutive pancreatoduodenectomies, performed at Verona Hospital<ORGANIZATION> from 2005 to 2016, were retrospectively analyzed. The study population was divided into three groups: preoperative biliary drained ( Stented Group<ORGANIZATION> ), preoperative jaundice without drainage ( Jaundiced Group<ORGANIZATION> ) and the control group of non-jaundiced, non-stented patients ( Control Group<ORGANIZATION> ). A total of 1500 patients were included. Seven<PERSON> hundred and fourteen patients ( 47.6 % ) received biliary drain ( Stented Group<ORGANIZATION> ), 258 ( 17.2 % ) patients did not ( Jaundiced Group<ORGANIZATION> ) and 528 ( 35.2 % ) patients represented the ( Control Group<ORGANIZATION> ). Major complications and mortality rates did not differ between groups. Conversely, the risk to develop the surgical site infections were doubled in the Stented Group<ORGANIZATION> ( 18.1 % ) ( OR=2.1, 95 % CI=1.5-2.8 ). In jaundiced patients, a preoperative bilirubin value greater than 7.5 mg/dl ( 128 μmol/l ) accurately predicts the likelihood of postoperative complications. Preoperative biliary drain does not increase major complications and mortality rates after pancreatoduodenectomy, but it is associated with higher surgical site infection rates. In jaundiced patients, a bilirubin value greater than 7.5 mg/dl ( 128 μmol/l ) should indicate the biliary drainage. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
