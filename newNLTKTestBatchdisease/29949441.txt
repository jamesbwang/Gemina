 There are a limited number of model species for decapod experimental embryology. To improve our understanding of developmental pattern evolution in the Decapoda, here we describe the early embryonic development of the caridean shrimp Lysmata<PERSON> boggessi, from immediately after fertilization to the hatching of the zoea larva, using fluorescence microscopy and whole-mount nuclear staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Lysmata<PERSON> boggessi follows the standard caridean pattern of early development, with early holoblastic cleavage that will later become superficial, to form a blastoderm. We found no evidence of stereotypical cleavage and the formation of blastomere interlocking bands, which suggests there is diversity in developmental patterns within the Caridea<ORGANIZATION>. Gastrulation starts 37 hours after fertilization, and the embryonized nauplius is formed 2 days later. Enlarged<PERSON> headlobes, early retinal differentiation, and delayed pereopod development are characteristics of the post-naupliar stages in this species. To facilitate comparative studies with other crustacean species, we propose a staging method based on our findings. Lysmata<PERSON> boggessi is a protandric simultaneous hermaphrodite that is relatively easy to breed in captivity and amenable to laboratory experimentation in studies of embryonic development.
