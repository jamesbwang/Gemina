 To describe critical care medicine residents ' training, expertise, and skills regarding organ and tissue donation processes and procedures. We undertook a qualitative multicentre study and employed a purposive sample of program directors, physicians, nurses, residents, and organ donation leaders from all nine academic intensive care unit ( ICU<ORGANIZATION> ) training centres ( five adult, four pediatric ) in Ontario<GPE> ( n = 71 ). Interviews, conducted by telephone between December 2015 and March 2016, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data<PERSON> collection and analysis were performed using an iterative process and continued until saturation was achieved. Five main themes were identified: 1 ) gaps in residents ' knowledge for both neurologic determination of death ( NDD<ORGANIZATION> ) and circulatory determination of death ( DCD<ORGANIZATION> ) cases ; 2 ) commitment to the provision of organ and tissue donation training ; 3 ) limited experiential learning ( NDD<ORGANIZATION> and DCD<ORGANIZATION> ) ; 4 ) challenges related to the provision of training on organ donation and need for a standardized curriculum ; and 5 ) communication with family members. Overall, this study showed system-level gaps in training resulting from the lack of a standardized provincial curriculum on organ donation. Qualitative data corroborated that residents need more exposure to clinical cases, especially regarding DCD<ORGANIZATION> donors. A standardized education curriculum would be beneficial for all residents within the ICU<ORGANIZATION>. Developing a better shared understanding of the donation process will improve team communication and performance, translate into a better end-of-life experience for families, and potentially result in increased donation rates.
