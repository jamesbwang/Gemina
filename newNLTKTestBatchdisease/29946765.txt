 Intestinal opportunistic infections are often caused by unicellular parasites. Individuals with decreased immunity are particularly susceptible to infection by said microorganisms, and when they are infected, diarrhea can be the main clinical manifestation. However, intestinal parasites have rarely been taken into account in intestinal disorders. In our study, an investigation was conducted to determine the prevalence of intestinal micro-pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium<GPE>, Giardia<GPE>, Blastocystis<PERSON>, and microsporidia, in hospitalized patients with different immunological statuses. The study at hand indicates that protozoan parasitic infections are rare among immunodeficient patients in Poland<GPE>. The overall prevalence of micro-pathogens among participants was 4.6 % ; it was three times higher in adults ( 12.5 % ) than in children ( 2.3 % ). Cryptosporidium<PERSON> and Cyclospora<ORGANIZATION> species ( Apicomplexa ) were diagnosed as the main cause of heavy diarrhea. Accordingly, adult patients were positive mainly for Blastocystis<ORGANIZATION> and microsporidia, while children were more often infected with the Cryptosporidium<ORGANIZATION> species.
