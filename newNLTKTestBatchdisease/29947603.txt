 The family Baculoviridae comprises large viruses with circular dsDNA<ORGANIZATION> genomes ranging from 80 to 180 kbp. The virions consist of enveloped, rod-shaped nucleocapsids and are embedded in distinctive occlusion bodies measuring 0.15-5 Âµm. The occlusion bodies consist of a matrix composed of a single viral protein expressed at high levels during infection. Members of this family infect exclusively larvae of the insect orders Lepidoptera<GPE>, Hymenoptera<GPE> and Diptera<PERSON>. This is a summary of the International Committee<ORGANIZATION> on Taxonomy of Viruses<GPE> ( ICTV<ORGANIZATION> ) Report on the taxonomy of the Baculoviridae<GPE>, which is available at www.ictv.global/report/baculoviridae.
