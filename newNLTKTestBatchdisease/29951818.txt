 It is now clear that the majority of transcription in humans results in the production of long non-protein-coding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) with a variable length spanning from 200 bp up to several kilobases. To date, we have a limited understanding of the lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> function, but a huge number of evidences have suggested that lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> represent an outstanding asset for cells. In particular, temporal and spatial expression of lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> appears to be important for proper neurological functioning. Stunningly, abnormal lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> function has been found as being critical for the onset of neurological disorders. This chapter focus on the lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> with a role in diseases affecting the central nervous system with particular regard for the lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> causing those neurodegenerative diseases that exhibit dementia and/or motor dysfunctions. A specific section will be dedicated to the human neuronal lncRNAs that have been modelled in Drosophila<GPE>. Finally<PERSON>, even if only few examples have been reported so far, an overview of the Drosophila<ORGANIZATION> lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> with neurological functions will be also included in this chapter.
