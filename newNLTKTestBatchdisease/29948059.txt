 To determine whether morphological changes can occur in the splenic artery ( SPA<ORGANIZATION> ) of autoimmune pancreatitis ( AIP<ORGANIZATION> ) cases, and if present, to compare them with those in pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PAC<ORGANIZATION> ) to clarify any arterial morphological differences between AIP<ORGANIZATION> and PAC<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 101 AIP cases were included in this study. The presence or absence of morphological change in the SPA<ORGANIZATION> was assessed, using arterial phase axial computed tomography images. Subsequently, imaging parameters ( imaging pattern, capsule-like rim, other organ involvement, splenic vein [ SPV ] stenosis, and SPA<ORGANIZATION> calcification ) were compared between cases with and without morphological changes. Additionally, comparison analyses ( visual SPA<ORGANIZATION> assessment and % minimal lumen diameter [ MLD<ORGANIZATION> ] stenosis ) among normal pancreas, PAC<ORGANIZATION>, and AIP<ORGANIZATION> groups were performed using early arterial phase ( EAP<ORGANIZATION> ) reconstructed images. In 25 ( 24.8 % ) AIP<ORGANIZATION> cases, marginal irregularities of the SPA<ORGANIZATION> were present. The presence of the capsule-like rim and SPV<ORGANIZATION> stenosis were significantly associated with the arterial morphological changes. All cases with morphological changes had a capsule-like rim. Visual assessment using EAP<ORGANIZATION> reconstructed images revealed irregularities of the SPA<ORGANIZATION> in 9 of 38 AIP cases ( 23.7 % ) ; however, arterial narrowing was not detected in any cases. % MLD<ORGANIZATION> stenosis in AIP<ORGANIZATION> group was significantly lower than that in PAC<ORGANIZATION> group ( p < 0.0001 ). Although approximately one-quarter of AIP<ORGANIZATION> cases potentially demonstrate marginal irregularity in the SPA<ORGANIZATION> when it is surrounded by an apparent capsule-like rim, arterial luminal narrowing rarely occurs in contrast to PAC<ORGANIZATION>. These arterial findings can help to distinguish AIP<ORGANIZATION> from PAC<ORGANIZATION>.
