 Pre Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ), when antiretroviral medication is taken by people who are HIV<ORGANIZATION> negative to prevent infection, has proven efficacy in decreasing infections among those at risk for acquiring HIV<ORGANIZATION>. Despite FDA<ORGANIZATION> approval and recommendation by the WHO<ORGANIZATION>, existing barriers to PrEP uptake include cost, access to PrEP care, and provider awareness. Previous studies assessing PrEP awareness among providers demonstrated that healthcare provider training enhances effective implementation of PrEP. Incorporation of education regarding effective HIV prevention strategies, including PrEP, into medical school curricula could be an important tool to increase awareness among physicians. This study evaluated the knowledge and awareness of HIV<ORGANIZATION> prevention among medical students and assessed perceptions of adequacy of HIV<ORGANIZATION> prevention instruction in current curricula at the University<ORGANIZATION> of Miami<GPE>. From formal medical education classwork, 14.3 % reported learning about PrEP. Behavioral counseling ( 57.1 % ) and treatment of HIV<ORGANIZATION> positive patients ( 67 % ) were more commonly taught as prevention measures. Despite this, 72 % reported willingness to recommend PrEP to at risk individuals. Opportunity exists to improve medical education regarding evidence-based HIV prevention including PrEP<ORGANIZATION> and to ensure that medical students are prepared to implement and support these strategies in their future practices.
