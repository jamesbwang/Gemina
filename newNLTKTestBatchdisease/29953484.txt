 Otitis<GPE> media ( OM ) is a major reason for children 's visits to physicians and a major cause of their being treated with antibiotics. It not only causes economic burdens but also influences hearing, speech, and education. To our knowledge, no nationwide population-based study has assessed the association between air pollution and OM<ORGANIZATION>. Therefore, this study evaluated the association between air pollution levels and the incidence of OM<ORGANIZATION>. We identified cases of OM that occurred in South Korea<GPE> between January 2011 and December 2012 from the Korea National Health<ORGANIZATION> Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort<PERSON> database, and evaluated its relationship with five air pollutants: particulate matter ( PM10<ORGANIZATION>, particulates ≤10 μm in diameter ), nitrogen dioxide ( NO2<ORGANIZATION> ), ozone ( O3 ), sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Associations between the weekly incidence of OM<ORGANIZATION> and the five air pollutants were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios ( ORs<ORGANIZATION> ) and their 99.9 % Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals after adjusting for gender, age, season, and region. We based our analysis on 160,875 hospital visits for OM by children aged < 15 years. Correlations with higher concentrations of the five pollutants showed higher ORs than did the reference values at most time lags. PM10<ORGANIZATION> had the largest influence on the OM<ORGANIZATION> incidence at a time lag of 0 weeks, whereas NO2<ORGANIZATION> and O3<PERSON> had the largest impacts on OM incidence at time lags of 1 and 4 weeks, respectively. These findings support the notion that the incidence of OM<ORGANIZATION> is associated with ambient air pollution.
