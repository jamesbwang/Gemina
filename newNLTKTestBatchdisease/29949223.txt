 Hs-CRP, Fetuin-A and S100A12<GPE> are acute phase proteins associated with many systemic diseases and conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical parameters and salivary Hs-CRP, Fetuin-A and S100A12<GPE> levels before and after non-surgical periodontal treatments in the patients with periodontal diseases. A total of 54 subjects were divided in to three groups of 18 patients each ; periodontally healthy, gingivitis, chronic periodontitis. Clinical<PERSON> periodontal parameters, salivary Hs-CRP, Fetuin-A and S100A12<GPE> levels and salivary flow rates were evaluated at baseline and a month after the treatments. Fetuin-A and S100A12<PERSON> were significantly lower and Hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in chronic periodontitis and gingivitis groups than control group at baseline ( P<PERSON> < .01 ). For the gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups, the post-treatment levels of salivary fetuin-A and S100A12<PERSON> were higher than the baseline levels of the same. ( p < .01 ). There were negative correlation between Hs-CRP and Fetuin-A, Hs-CRP and S100A12<GPE> ( p < .001 ) and positive correlation between Fetuin-A and S100A12<GPE> ( p < .05 ) at baseline. Salivary Fetuin-A and S100A12<GPE> levels decreased with increasing severity of periodontal disease. These results suggest that salivary Fetuin-A may play an important role as a negative acute phase protein in periodontal diseases. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
