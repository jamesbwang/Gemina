 Mycobacterium<GPE> tuberculosis as an intracellular pathogen causes tuberculosis ( TB ). Due to the long time required for treatment, hepatotoxicity of drugs and also emergence of multidrug-resistant ( MDR<ORGANIZATION> ) and extremely drug resistant ( XDR<ORGANIZATION> ) strains, TB<ORGANIZATION> is currently a major public health problem. Some medicinal plants possess remarkable activity against Mycobacterium<GPE>. Among them, Lamiaceae<PERSON> family are of pharmaceutical interest because of their potential antimicrobial properties. The aim of the study was to evaluate the in vitro activities of Satureja<GPE> rechingeri, Satureja<PERSON> khuzestanica and Zataria<PERSON> multiflora against MDR<ORGANIZATION> M. tuberculosis and two non-tuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM<ORGANIZATION> ). The recent patents on plant compositions ( US7641919 B2<ORGANIZATION>, US7887860 B2<ORGANIZATION>, US<ORGANIZATION> 8865231 B2, US<ORGANIZATION> 9345659 B2, WO 2014158797 A1 and WO 2014158877 A1 ) helped in selecting the anti-mycobacterial drugs. The essential oils were prepared by the standard method. The confirmed strains were obtained from the microbial collection of Tehran University<ORGANIZATION> of Medical Sciences<ORGANIZATION>. Minimum<PERSON> inhibitory concentrations ( MICs<ORGANIZATION> ) of essential oils of plants against mycobacterial strains were determined using standard broth microdilution method. MDR<ORGANIZATION> M. tuberculosis was completely inhibited by Z. multiflora at 78μg/ml concentration. S. rechingeri and S. khuzestanica also showed same anti-mycobacterial activity against MDR<ORGANIZATION> M. tuberculosis with MICs<ORGANIZATION> of 156 μg/ml. The MICs<ORGANIZATION> of the essential oils against M. tuberculosis H37Rv<PERSON>, M. kansasii and M. fortuitum were in the range from 39 to 156 μg/ml. The studied medicinal plants showed notable effects against mycobacterial strains. Our results indicated that utilization of Lamiaceae<GPE> family can be helpful for treatment of mycobacterial infections.
