 To evaluate clinical, demographic, and histopathological characteristics of pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa. A cross-sectional study was conducted over a 64-year period. Information was collected from medical charts, and all archived histopathologic specimens with diagnoses of any pigmented lesion were retrieved. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS<ORGANIZATION> software. A total of 34,127 archived specimens were reviewed, revealing 458 ( 1.34 % ) pigmented lesions, of which 230 were melanocytic and 228 non-melanocytic. Most patients were females ( 74.2 % ), white-skinned ( 49.1 % ), in the third and seventh decades of life ( mean of 45 years ). Most lesions were macular ( 59.8 % ), followed by plaques and nodules ( 4.8 % ), measuring 0-5 mm ( 41.9 % ). Cheek<PERSON> mucosa ( 21.0 % ), alveolar mucosa ( 16.6 % ), and gingiva ( 11.8 % ) were the most commonly affected sites. Amalgam<PERSON> tattoo was applied in 212 cases ( 46.3 % ), followed by melanotic macule ( 22.9 % ) and nevus ( 20.5 % ). Other diagnoses included racial pigmentation, exogenous pigmentation, melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy, melanoma, melanocanthoma, smoker 's melanosis, and heavy metal pigmentation. Pigmented lesions represent an uncommon diagnosis in oral pathology routines. The most frequent entities are amalgam tattoo, melanotic macule, and nevus. Patients are usually middle-aged women presenting a small, long-lasting, macular lesion on the cheek mucosa. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
