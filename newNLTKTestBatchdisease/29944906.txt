 Chronic<GPE> myelogenous leukemia ( CML<ORGANIZATION> ) accounts for 15-20 % of all leukemias affecting adults. Despite recent advances in the development of specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs<ORGANIZATION> ), some CML patients suffer from relapse due to TKI<ORGANIZATION> resistance. Here, we assessed the efficacy of a novel combinatorial arsenic trioxide ( ATO<ORGANIZATION> ) and cisplatin ( CDDP<ORGANIZATION> ) treatment ( Ato-C ) in human Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic cells. Combination index analyses revealed that a synergistic interaction of ATO<ORGANIZATION> and CDDP<ORGANIZATION> elicits a wide range of effects in K562<GPE>, KU-812, MEG-A2, and KCL-22 cells. Notably, Ato-C synergistically enhanced apoptosis and decreased the survival of both acquired TKI-resistant CML cells and the cells expressing mutant Bcr-Abl
