 Inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS<ORGANIZATION> ) might reduce the risk of lung cancer by controlling airway inflammation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ) because both are associated with chronic inflammation. The objective was to assess the impact of ICS<ORGANIZATION> on lung cancer risk reduction in COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients. We performed a nested case-control study based on the database of the National Health<ORGANIZATION> Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort<PERSON>, a nationally representative cohort of 1,125,691 participants in Korea<GPE> followed over 11 years. The eligible population was patients aged 30 to 89 years who were newly diagnosed with COPD<ORGANIZATION> and initiated inhaled medications after diagnosis. Cases were defined as individuals diagnosed with lung cancer after the initiation of inhaled medications and were matched with controls by propensity score at a 1:4 ratio. We identified 265 individuals with lung cancer, matched with 1,060 controls. Use of ICS<ORGANIZATION> was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer ( adjusted hazard ratio [ aHR ] 0.74, 95 % CI 0.57-0.96 ). The high cumulative ICS dose group, defined as those above the third quartile of ICS<ORGANIZATION> dose distribution, had a lower risk of lung cancer than the low cumulative dose group ( aHR 0.51<ORGANIZATION>, 95 % CI 0.34-0.75 ). The effect of ICS<ORGANIZATION> on lung cancer risk reduction was more remarkable in former smokers than current smokers. Additionally, the result was consistent in men regardless of the classification according to ICS<ORGANIZATION> use, while it was not significant in women. ICS, particularly at high cumulative dose, might be associated with decreased risk of lung cancer in patients with COPD<ORGANIZATION>. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
