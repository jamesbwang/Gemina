 A right-sided ventriculoperitoneal ( VP ) shunt was placed in patient with congenital hydrocephalous in the first month of life. Three-month review visit showed no improvement and after evaluation and computerised tomogram ( CT ) scan brain, another VP shunt was placed on the left side without handling the previous right sided VP shunt. Patient<PERSON> did not improve and again presented with fever and fits. CT scan brain with and without contrast was repeated, which showed bilateral subdural empyema and right-sided cranially migrated VP shunt. Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF<ORGANIZATION> ) analysis demonstrated infection. Bilateral burr hole drainage of subdural empyema with subsequent removal of right-sided migrated VP shunt was done. Cranial end of left-sided VP shunt was converted into external ventricular drain ( EVD<ORGANIZATION> ) and its abdominal end removed. Patient<PERSON> was placed on intravenous as well as intraventricular antibiotics through the EVD<ORGANIZATION>. Later, right-sided VP shunt was placed after clearance of infection. Regular follow-up showed that the patient is doing well.
