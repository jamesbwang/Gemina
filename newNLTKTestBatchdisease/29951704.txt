 Experimental<GPE> evidence suggests that oxidative stress ( OS ) may increase the activity of arginine methylating enzymes that produce the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA<ORGANIZATION> ). In addition, it is well documented that OS can significantly decrease the synthesis and/or activity of ADMA<ORGANIZATION> degrading enzymes, thus causing ADMA<ORGANIZATION> accumulation in biological fluids. Recent reports have focused on circulating methylated arginine concentrations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a disease characterized by a significant increase in OS. This review discusses the results of these studies and the opportunities for further research in this area.
