 Increasing incidence of Onychomycosis<GPE> and Tinea<PERSON> pedis in humans of industrialized countries together with deep tissue infections are a therapeutic challenge in clinical mycology. For a better understanding of the pathology and immunology of infection we analyzed the exoproteomes of three reference strains of the most common clinical dermatophyte species ( Trichophyton<GPE> rubrum, T. interdigitale, A. benhamiae ) and of Trichophyton<GPE> strains isolated from affected patients. Extracellular proteins of those in-vitro grown strains were separated via 2D High Performance Electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry to find proteins with provoked host immune reactivity. More than 80 secreted proteins including virulence factors such as peptidases and other hydrolases were identified. By Western<GPE> blotting with respective patient sera, up to 31 proteins with significant antigen-antibody-reactions were detected in comparison to control sera, e.g. peptidases as well as several oxidoreductases. One protein, beta-glucosidase F2SZI9<ORGANIZATION> seems to be a commonly processed antigen in all Trichophyton infections. These first global exoproteome data of three dermatophyte species could be a stepping stone on the way to further study of the molecular mechanisms of Trichophyton<GPE> pathogenicity-associated traits. Possible candidates for potential new diagnostic methods or vaccination have to be validated in further investigations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
