 Under the direction of the German Society<ORGANIZATION> of Phlebology<GPE> ( Deutsche Gesellschaft<ORGANIZATION> f√ºr Phlebologie ) and in cooperation with other specialist associations, the S1 guideline on intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC<ORGANIZATION> ) was adopted in January 2018. It replaces the previous guideline from March 2005. The aim of the guideline is to optimize the indication and therapeutic use of IPC<ORGANIZATION> in vascular diseases and edema. An extensive literature search of MEDLINE<ORGANIZATION>, existing guidelines, and work relevant to the topic was performed. In view of the often methodologically weak study quality with often small numbers of cases and heterogeneous treatment protocols, recommendations can often only be derived from the available data using good clinical practice/expert consensus. Intermittent pneumatic compression is used for thromboembolism prophylaxis, decongestive therapy for edema, and to positively influence arterial and venous circulation to improve clinical symptoms and accelerate ulcer healing in both the outpatient and inpatient care setting. The therapy regimens and devices used depend on the indication and target location. They can be used as outpatient and inpatient devices as well as at home for long-term indications. A target indication is thrombosis prophylaxis. IPC should be used in severe chronic venous insufficiency ( stages C4b<ORGANIZATION> to C6<GPE> ), in extremity lymphedema as an add-on therapy and in peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAOD<ORGANIZATION> ) with stable intermittent claudication or critical ischemia. IPC can be used in post-traumatic edema, therapy-resistant venous edema, lipedema and hemiplegia with sensory deficits and edema. Absolute<PERSON> and relative contraindications to IPC<ORGANIZATION> must be taken into account and risks considered and avoided as far as possible. Adverse events are extremely rare if IPC<ORGANIZATION> is used correctly. If the indication and application are correct-also as an add-on therapy-it is a safe and effective treatment method, especially for the treatment of the described vascular diseases and edema as well as thrombosis prophylaxis.
