 The successful expansion of HIV<ORGANIZATION> services in sub-Saharan Africa<ORGANIZATION> has been a signature achievement of global public health. This article explores health workforce-related lessons from HIV<ORGANIZATION> scale-up, their implications for integrating noncommunicable disease ( NCD<ORGANIZATION> ) services into HIV<ORGANIZATION> programs, ways to ensure that healthcare workers have the knowledge, skills, resources, and enabling environment they need to provide comprehensive integrated HIV/NCD services, and discussion of a priority research agenda. We conducted a scoping review of the published and 'gray ' literature and drew upon our cumulative experience designing, implementing and evaluating HIV<ORGANIZATION> and NCD<ORGANIZATION> programs in low-resource settings. Lessons<PERSON> learned from HIV<ORGANIZATION> programs include the role of task shifting and the optimal use of multidisciplinary teams. A responsible and adaptable policy environment is also imperative ; norms and regulations must keep pace with the growing evidence base for task sharing, and early engagement of regulatory authorities will be needed for successful HIV/NCD integration. Ex-ante consideration of work culture will also be vital, given its impact on the quality of service delivery. Finally, capacity building of a robust interdisciplinary workforce is essential to foster integrated patient-centered care. To succeed, close collaboration between the health and higher education sectors is needed and comprehensive competency-based capacity building plans for various health worker cadres along the education and training continuum are required. We also outline research priorities for HIV/NCD integration in three key domains: governance and policy ; education, training, and management ; and service delivery.
