 Vaccinology<GPE> faces the challenge of developing improved immunization approaches that are able to induce long-term immunity with the desired Th profile according to the pathology. In this context, new vehicles for efficient antigen delivery that exert adjuvant effects play a critical role in addressing this goal. Herein<PERSON>, mesoporous silicon particles ( PSiP<ORGANIZATION> ) were assessed as carriers for a peptide-based vaccine targeting the receptor for advanced glycation end products ( RAGE<ORGANIZATION> ), which is a relevant receptor in Alzheimer<GPE> & acute ; s disease and other diseases. A RAGE<ORGANIZATION> peptide was adsorbed onto PSiP<ORGANIZATION> ( PSiP<ORGANIZATION> vaccine ) and administered to BALB/c mice, leading to immune responses that were similar in magnitude to those induced by the soluble peptide. However, the response induced by PSiP<ORGANIZATION> lasted for a significantly longer period when compared with the behavior of the group immunized with the peptide alone. Therefore, PSiP<ORGANIZATION> are proposed as carriers to enhance immune memory, which is critical in vaccination. This study opens interesting perspectives related to the application of PSiP<ORGANIZATION> in vaccinology.
