 Influenza<PERSON> A ( H3N2<ORGANIZATION> ) viruses are associated with outbreaks worldwide and can cause disease with severe complications. The impact can be reduced by vaccination, which induces neutralizing antibodies that mainly target the haemagglutinin glycoprotein ( HA ). In this study we generated neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs<ORGANIZATION> ) against A/Victoria/361/2011 and identified their epitopes by generating and sequencing escape viruses. The epitopes are located in antigenic site B, which is near the receptor-binding site and is immunodominant in humans. Amino<PERSON> acid ( aa ) substitutions at positions 156, 158, 159, 189, 190 and 193 in antigenic site B led to reduced ability of mAbs<ORGANIZATION> to block receptor-binding. The majority of A ( H3N2<ORGANIZATION> ) viruses that have been circulating since 2014 are antigenically distinct from previous A ( H3N2<ORGANIZATION> ) viruses. The neutralization-sensitive epitopes in antigenic site B of currently circulating viruses were examined with these mAbs. We found that clade 3C.2a viruses, possessing an additional potential glycosylation site at HA1<ORGANIZATION> position N158<PERSON>, were poorly recognized by some of the mAbs<ORGANIZATION>, but other residues, notably at position 159, also affected antibody binding. Through a mass spectrometric ( MS ) analysis of HA<ORGANIZATION>, the glycosylated sites of HA1<ORGANIZATION> were established and we determined that residue 158 of HA1<ORGANIZATION> was glycosylated and so modified a neutralization-sensitive epitope. Understanding and monitoring individual epitopes is likely to improve vaccine strain selection.
