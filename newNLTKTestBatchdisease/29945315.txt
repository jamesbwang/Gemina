 Atherosclerotic<GPE> cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and both coronary artery disease ( CAD<ORGANIZATION> ) and diabetes mellitus are associated with inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests a relationship of the monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio ( MHR<ORGANIZATION> ) with the incidence and severity of CAD<ORGANIZATION>. The aim of the present study was to examine the association of MHR<ORGANIZATION> with CAD<ORGANIZATION> in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 458 consecutive individuals were enrolled, comprising 178 type 2 diabetic patients, 124 type 2 diabetes with CAD<ORGANIZATION>, and 156 healthy volunteers as the controls. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between the MHR<ORGANIZATION> and CAD<ORGANIZATION> in type 2 diabetes, and the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve of MHR<ORGANIZATION> was used for predicting the presence of CAD<ORGANIZATION> in type 2 diabetic patients. Values of MHR<ORGANIZATION> were significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD<ORGANIZATION> compared with those without CAD<ORGANIZATION> and the control group. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that MHR<ORGANIZATION> was an independent predictor of the presence of CAD<ORGANIZATION> in type 2 diabetic patients ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.361, 95 % CI 1.245 - 1.487, p < 0.0001 ). Based on the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve, the cutoff value of MHR<ORGANIZATION> ( > 8.2 ) in predicting the presence of CAD<ORGANIZATION> in type 2 diabetic patients yields a sensitivity and specificity of 83.74 % and 62.15 %, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.795 ( 95 % CI: 0.745 - 0.840 ). The MHR<ORGANIZATION> is strongly associated with CAD<ORGANIZATION> in type 2 diabetes and might be a potential biomarker to predict the presence of CAD<ORGANIZATION> in type 2 diabetic patients.
