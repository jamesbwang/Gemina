 Dengue<GPE> is a mild flu-like arboviral illness caused by dengue virus ( DENV<ORGANIZATION> ) that occurs in tropical and subtropical countries. An increasing number of reports have been indicating that dengue is also associated to neurological manifestations, however, little is known regarding the neuropathogenesis of the disease. Here, using BALB/c mice intravenously infected with DENV-2 strain 66985, we demonstrated that the virus is capable of invading and damaging the host 's central nervous system ( CNS<ORGANIZATION> ). Brain<PERSON> and cerebellum of infected animals revealed histological alterations such as the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, thickening of pia matter and disorganization of white matter. Additionally, it was also seen that infection lead to altered morphology of neuroglial cells and apoptotic cell death. Such observations highlighted possible alterations that DENV<ORGANIZATION> may promote in the host 's CNS<ORGANIZATION> during a natural infection, hence, helping us to better understand the neuropathological component of the disease.
