 Programmed<GPE> cell death ( PCD<ORGANIZATION> ), or apoptosis, plays essential roles in various cellular and developmental processes, and deregulation of apoptosis causes many diseases. Thus, regulation of apoptotic process is very important. Drosophila<PERSON> tankyrase ( DTNKS<ORGANIZATION> ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein with poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase activity. In mammalian cells, tankyrases ( TNKSs<ORGANIZATION> ) have been reported to regulate cell death. To determine whether DTNKS<ORGANIZATION> plays function in inducing apoptosis in in vivo development, we use Drosophila<PERSON> as a model system and generate transgenic flies expressing DTNKS<ORGANIZATION>. We show that ectopic expression of DTNKS<ORGANIZATION> promotes caspase-dependent apoptosis and knockdown of DTNKS<ORGANIZATION> by RNAi<ORGANIZATION> dramatically alleviates apoptotic defect caused by ectopic expression of pro-apoptotic proteins hid or rpr during eye development. Moreover, our result shows that ectopic expression of DTNKS<ORGANIZATION> triggers the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK<ORGANIZATION> ) signaling, which is required for DTNKS-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our finding identified the role of DTNKS<ORGANIZATION> in regulating apoptosis by activating JNK<ORGANIZATION> signaling in Drosophila<GPE>.
