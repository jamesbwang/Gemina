 A 3D convolution neural network ( CNN<ORGANIZATION> ) of deep learning architecture is supplied with essential visual features to accurately classify and segment granulation, necrotic eschar, and slough tissues in pressure ulcer color images. After finding a region of interest ( ROI<ORGANIZATION> ), the features are extracted from both the original and convolved with a pre-selected Gaussian<GPE> kernel 3D HSI images, combined with first-order models of current and prior visual appearance. The models approximate empirical marginal probability distributions of voxel-wise signals with linear combinations of discrete Gaussians ( LCDG<ORGANIZATION> ). The framework was trained and tested on 193 color pressure ulcer images. The classification accuracy and robustness were evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient ( DSC<ORGANIZATION> ), the percentage area distance ( PAD<ORGANIZATION> ), and the area under the ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ). The obtained preliminary DSC<ORGANIZATION> of 92 %, PAD<ORGANIZATION> of 13 %, and AUC<ORGANIZATION> of 95 % are promising.
