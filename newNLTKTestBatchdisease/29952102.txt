 Postmortem<GPE> studies of Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease ( PD ) suggest that Lewy<PERSON> body pathology accumulates in a predictable topographical sequence, beginning in the olfactory bulb, followed by caudal brainstem, substantia nigra, limbic cortex, and neocortex. Diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI<ORGANIZATION> ) is sensitive, if not specific, to early disease-related white matter ( WM ) change in a variety of traumatic and degenerative brain diseases. Although numerous cross-sectional studies have reported DWI<ORGANIZATION> differences in cerebral WM in PD<GPE>, only a few longitudinal studies have investigated whether DWI<ORGANIZATION> change exceeds that of normal aging or coincides with regional Lewy<PERSON> body accumulation. This study mapped regional differences in the rate of DWI-based microstructural change between 29 PD patients and 43 age-matched controls over 18 months. Iterative within- and between-subject tensor-based registration was completed on motion- and eddy current-corrected DWI<ORGANIZATION> images, then baseline versus follow-up difference maps of fractional anisotropy, mean, radial, and axial diffusivity were analyzed in the Biological Parametric<ORGANIZATION> Mapping toolbox for MATLAB<ORGANIZATION>. This analysis showed that PD<ORGANIZATION> patients had a greater decline in WM<GPE> integrity in the rostral brainstem, caudal subcortical WM, and cerebellar peduncles, compared with controls. In addition, patients with unilateral clinical signs at baseline experienced a greater rate of WM<ORGANIZATION> change over the 18-month study than patients with bilateral signs. These findings suggest that rate of WM<ORGANIZATION> microstructural change in PD<ORGANIZATION> exceeds that of normal aging and is maximal during early stage disease. In addition, the neuroanatomic locations ( rostral brainstem and subcortical WM ) of accelerated WM change fit with current theories of topographic disease progression.
