 Surgical wounds healing by secondary intention ( SWHSI<ORGANIZATION> ) are increasingly being treated with negative-pressure wound therapy ( NPWT<ORGANIZATION> ) despite a lack of high-quality research evidence regarding its clinical and cost-effectiveness. This pilot feasibility RCT<ORGANIZATION> aimed to assess the methods for and feasibility of conducting a future definitive RCT<ORGANIZATION> of NPWT<ORGANIZATION> for the treatment of SWHSI<ORGANIZATION>. Eligible consenting adult patients receiving care at the study sites ( 2 acute and 1 community ) and with a SWHSI<ORGANIZATION> appropriate for NPWT<ORGANIZATION> or wound dressing treatment were randomized 1: 1 centrally to receive NPWT<ORGANIZATION> or usual care ( no NPWT ). Participants were followed up every 1-2 weeks for 3 months. Feasibility ( recruitment rate, time to intervention delivery ) and clinical ( time to wound healing ) outcomes were assessed. A total of 248 participants were screened for eligibility ; 40 ( 16Â·1 per cent ) were randomized, 19 to NPWT<ORGANIZATION> and 21 to usual care. Twenty-four of the 40 wounds were located on the foot. Participants received NPWT<ORGANIZATION> for a median of 18 ( range 0-72 ) days. Two participants in the NPWT<ORGANIZATION> group never received the intervention and 14 received NPWT<ORGANIZATION> within 48 h of randomization. Five participants in the usual care group received NPWT<ORGANIZATION> during the study. Ten of the 40 wounds were deemed to have healed during the study. A full-scale RCT<ORGANIZATION> to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of NPWT<ORGANIZATION> for SWHSI<ORGANIZATION> is feasible. This study identified crucial information on recruitment rates and data collection methods to consider during the design of a definitive RCT<ORGANIZATION>.
