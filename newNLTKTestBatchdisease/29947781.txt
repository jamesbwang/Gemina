 Inflammatory<GPE> bowel disease ( IBD<ORGANIZATION> ) may present with nonspecific symptoms and diagnostic findings. Therefore, many diseases may mimic the clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, and histologic features of IBD<ORGANIZATION>. In this paper, we will review mimics of IBD<ORGANIZATION>, dividing the diseases that can imitate IBD<ORGANIZATION> into noninfectious and infectious causes. For each disease state, we will discuss the clinical symptoms and endoscopic and histologic features. Finally, we will discuss how to distinguish these distinct disorders from IBD<ORGANIZATION>.
