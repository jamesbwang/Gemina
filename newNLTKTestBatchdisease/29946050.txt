 The type III<ORGANIZATION> secretion system ( T3SS<ORGANIZATION> ) forms the functional core of injectisomes, protein transporters that allow bacteria to deliver virulence factors into their hosts for infection, and flagella, which are critical for many pathogens to reach the site of infection. In spite of intensive genetic and biochemical studies, the T3SS<ORGANIZATION> protein export mechanism remains unclear due to the difficulty of accurate measurement of protein export
