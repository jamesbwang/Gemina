 Next-generation sequencing ( NGS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a useful tool for detecting genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA<ORGANIZATION> ( ctDNA<ORGANIZATION> ). To date, most ctDNA tests have been performed on patients with widely metastatic disease. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis ( metastases ) present unique prognostic and therapeutic challenges. We therefore explored preoperative ctDNA in patients with peritoneal metastases undergoing surgery. Patients<PERSON> referred for surgical resection of peritoneal metastases underwent preoperative blood-derived ctDNA<ORGANIZATION> analysis ( clinical-grade NGS<ORGANIZATION> [ 68-73 genes ] ). ctDNA<PERSON> was quantified as the percentage of altered circulating cell-free DNA<ORGANIZATION> ( % cfDNA ). Eighty patients had ctDNA<ORGANIZATION> testing: 46 ( 57.5 % ) women ; median age 55.5 years. The following diagnoses were included: 59 patients ( 73.8 % ), appendix cancer ; 11 ( 13.8 % ), colorectal ; five ( 6.3 % ), peritoneal mesothelioma ; two ( 2.5 % ), small bowel ; one ( 1.3 % ) each of cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian, and testicular cancer. Thirty-one patients ( 38.8 % ) had detectable preoperative ctDNA<ORGANIZATION> alterations, most frequently in the following genes: TP53 ( 25.8 % of all alterations detected ) and KRAS<ORGANIZATION> ( 11.3 % ). Among 15 patients with tissue DNA<ORGANIZATION> NGS, 33.3 % also had ctDNA alterations ( overall concordance = 96.7 % ). Patients with high ctDNA<ORGANIZATION> quantities ( â‰¥ 0.25 % cfDNA<ORGANIZATION>, n = 25 ) had a shorter progression-free survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) than those with lower ctDNA<ORGANIZATION> quantities ( n = 55 ; 7.8 vs. 15.0 months ; hazard ratio 3.23, 95 % confidence interval 1.43-7.28, p = 0.005 univariate, p = 0.044 multivariate ). A significant proportion of patients with peritoneal metastases referred for surgical intervention have detectable ctDNA<ORGANIZATION> alterations preoperatively. Patients with high levels of ctDNA<ORGANIZATION> have a worse prognosis independent of histologic grade.
