 Chronic<GPE> intermittent hypoxia ( CIH<ORGANIZATION> ), as the foremost pathophysiological change of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA<ORGANIZATION> ), contributes to continued deterioration in renal function. Nucleotide-binding domain like receptor protein 3 ( NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> ) inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that triggers innate immune responses to infection and cell stress through activation of caspase-1 and maturation of inflammatory pro-interleukin-1β cytokine. Emerging evidence indicates that inhibition of the NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> inflammasome ameliorates renal injury. Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> inflammasome participates in CIH-induced renal injury. The molecular mechanisms modulating NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> inﬂammasome activation remain to be elucidated. Compared with wild-type mice, NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> knockout mice dramatically protected them from kidney injury, as indicated by the restoration of creatinine levels, lessened histopathological alterations, and the suppression of macrophages inﬁltration stained with F4/80. NLRP3 deﬁciency notably reversed CIH-induced oxidative stress ( malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase ), concomitantly with the abrogated apoptosis-related proteins and proinflammatory signaling pathway. Consistently, NLRP3-deﬁcient tubular cells remarkably inhibited reactive oxygen species generation and NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> inﬂammasome activation. Furthermore, our study revealed that microRNA-155 ( miR-155 ) was augmented in the renal tissue and HK-2 cells exposed to CIH<ORGANIZATION>. In addition, we investigated the role of miR-155 in the regulation of NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> inﬂammasome. Inhibition of miR-155 suppressed the CIH-induced NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation in renal tubular cells, whereas overexpression of miR-155 promoted oxidation and enhanced NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> pathway. Collectively, we demonstrated that miR-155 might be a positive-regulator of NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> pathway by inhibiting the targeted FOXO3a<ORGANIZATION> gene. These results established a link between the miR-155/FOXO3a pathway and the NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> inﬂammasome, suggesting pharmacological blockage of NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> as a potential therapeutic strategy for OSA-associated chronic kidney disease.
