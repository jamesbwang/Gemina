 This review aimed at evaluating the effects of chronic periodontitis ( CP ) treatment with local statins as adjuncts to scaling and root planing ( SRP<ORGANIZATION> ), compared with SRP<ORGANIZATION> alone or with placebo. Electronic<PERSON> and hand searches were conducted in three databases to select randomized controlled trials ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) comparing SRP<ORGANIZATION> + statins versus SRP<ORGANIZATION> alone. Random effects models were conducted to determine the clinical attachment level ( CAL<ORGANIZATION> ) gain as the primary outcome variable, and probing pocket depth ( PPD<ORGANIZATION> ) reduction, modified sulcus bleeding index ( mSBI<ORGANIZATION> ), and intrabony defect depth ( IBD<ORGANIZATION> ) as the secondary outcomes. Of the 526 papers identified, 15 articles met the criteria for inclusion in this systematic review, and 13 in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant CAL<ORGANIZATION> gain ( mean differences [ MD<ORGANIZATION> ] = 1.84 mm, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.45 to 2.23 ; p = 0.000 ), PPD<ORGANIZATION> reduction ( MD<ORGANIZATION> = 1.69 mm, 95 % CI = 1.37 to 2.04 ; p = 0.000 ), mSBI<ORGANIZATION> change ( MD<ORGANIZATION> = 0.70, 95 % CI = 0.57 to 0.84 ; p = 0.000 ), and IBD<ORGANIZATION> ( MD<ORGANIZATION> = 1.48, 95 % CI = 1.30 to 1.67 ; p = 0.000 ) attributed to SRP<ORGANIZATION> + statin treatment ( 6 months ). Within the limitations of this study, the collective evidence emerging from this systematic review and meta-analysis may support the use of locally applied statins as adjuncts to SRP<ORGANIZATION> in CP<GPE> treatment, based on being an easy, low-cost alternative, with lesser adverse effects on bacterial resistance. These results should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians<PERSON> might consider the use of SRP<ORGANIZATION> + statins as an adjunct over other alternative approaches, based on the results of the present review. The informed decision should be taken, considering the patient 's values and preferences, and the intervention to be implemented by the clinician.
