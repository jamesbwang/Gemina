 Obstructive<GPE> sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS<ORGANIZATION> ) has been recently proposed as an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Cystatin C<PERSON> ( Cyst<ORGANIZATION> C ) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL<ORGANIZATION> ) are novel biomarkers for the earlier detection of latent kidney disease. The aim of the study was to assess serum Cyst C and NGAL<ORGANIZATION> levels in otherwise healthy OSAS<ORGANIZATION> patients and to explore possible associations with sleep parameters. Consecutive subjects ( n = 96, 79.2 % males ), without known comorbidities, with symptoms suggestive of OSAS<ORGANIZATION> were included. All of them underwent polysomnography ( PSG<ORGANIZATION> ) and blood examination for the measurement of serum Cyst C and NGAL<ORGANIZATION> levels. Based on apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI<ORGANIZATION> ), subjects were classified into two groups: 32 controls and 64 OSAS<ORGANIZATION> patients, with no significant differences in terms of age ( 50.1 ± 11.7 vs 51 ± 12.2 years, p = 0.747 ) and BMI<ORGANIZATION> ( 33.9 ± 8.8 vs 35.9 ± 13.1 kg/m Higher risk for latent kidney disease in otherwise healthy OSAS<ORGANIZATION> patients is indicated. Sleep hypoxia seems to be a significant contributor in the pathogenetic process of renal dysfunction in OSAS<ORGANIZATION>.
