 Although left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH<ORGANIZATION> ) has been established as a predictor of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ), the relationship between the prevalence of LVH<ORGANIZATION> and CKD<ORGANIZATION> stage during the pre-dialysis period has not been fully examined. We measured left ventricular mass index ( LVMI<ORGANIZATION> ) in a cross-sectional cohort of participants in the Chronic Kidney Disease Japan Cohort<ORGANIZATION> ( CKD-JAC ) study to identify factors that are associated with increased LVMI<ORGANIZATION> in patients with stage 3-5 CKD<ORGANIZATION>. We analyzed the baseline characteristics in 1088 participants ( male 63.8 %, female 36.2 % ). Diabetes mellitus was the underlying disease in 41.7 % of the patients, and mean age was 61.8 Â± 11.1 years. LVH<ORGANIZATION> was detected in 23.4 % of the patients at baseline. By multivariate logistic analysis, independent risk factors for LVH<ORGANIZATION> were past history of cardiovascular disease [ odds ratio ( OR ) 2.364 ; 95 % confidence interval ( [ CI ) 1.463-3.822 ; P<PERSON> = 0.0004 ], body mass index ( OR 1.108 ; 95 % CI 1.046-1.173 ; P<PERSON> = 0.0005 ), systolic blood pressure ( OR 1.173 ; 95 % CI 1.005-1.369 ; P<PERSON> = 0.0433 ), urinary albumin ( OR 1.425 ; 95 % CI 1.028-1.974 ; P<PERSON> = 0.0333 ), and serum total cholesterol level ( OR 0.994 ; 95 % CI 0.989-0.999 ; P<PERSON> = 0.0174 ). The cross-sectional baseline data from the CKD-JAC study shed light on the association between LVH<ORGANIZATION> and risk factors in patients with decreased renal function. Further<PERSON> longitudinal analyses of the CKD-JAC cohort are needed to evaluate the prognostic value of LVH<ORGANIZATION> in CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients.
