 Chronic<GPE> suppurative otitis media ( CSOM<ORGANIZATION> ) is a common public health problem worldwide and a major cause of hearing impairment especially in developing countries. The role of Mannose-Binding Lectin ( MBL<ORGANIZATION> ), a component of innate immunity, in CSOM<ORGANIZATION> has not been studied. The aim of the study was to examine whether MBL<ORGANIZATION> deficiency was more frequently present in cases group of tubotympanic CSOM<ORGANIZATION> patients rather than healthy subjects. This was an analytic observational study. Subjects were enrolled in the Otorhinolaryngology Clinic<ORGANIZATION> at Margono Soekarjo Hospital<FACILITY>, Purwokerto<PERSON>, Indonesia<GPE>. An independent From 36 tubotympanic CSOM<ORGANIZATION> patients, there were 8 ( 22.22 % ) patients with MBL<ORGANIZATION> deficiency ( MBL<ORGANIZATION> level < 100 ng/ml ), while no deficiency was found in the control group. The mean of MBL<ORGANIZATION> level in cases group was 354.88 ng/ml, with the lowest level being 0.001 ng/ml and the highest level 690.24 ng/ml, while in the control group MBL<ORGANIZATION> level mean was 376.27 with the lowest level being 188.71 and the highest level 794.54 ng/ml. There was no significant difference of MBL<ORGANIZATION> serum level between tubotympanic CSOM<ORGANIZATION> and control group. However, the presence of subjects with MBL<ORGANIZATION> deficiency in the tubotympanic CSOM<ORGANIZATION> group might be considered as playing a role in the tubotympanic CSOM<ORGANIZATION>.
