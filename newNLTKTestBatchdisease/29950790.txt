 Critical<GPE> limb ischemia ( CLI<ORGANIZATION> ) remains a challenge for an interdisciplinary therapeutic team due to chronic nonhealing wounds. Against this background, there is a necessity of quality control after revascularization. Beside the isolated evaluation of the macrocirculation by Ankle-Brachial or Toe-Brachial Index measurements, the microcirculation as an additional important factor of wound healing often remains underestimated. The following article gives an overview about the current investigation methods for noninvasive perfusion control of the CLI<ORGANIZATION> patient. Therefore, transcutaneous oxygen pressure ( tcpO<ORGANIZATION>
