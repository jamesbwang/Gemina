 Sclerotinia<GPE> sclerotiorum is responsible for white mold of soybean, and the difficulty to control the disease in Brazil<GPE> is causing million-dollar damages. Stachybotrys<PERSON> levispora showed activity against S. sclerotiorum. In our present investigation, we analyzed the chemical basis of this inhibition. Eight compounds were isolated and using spectroscopic methods their structures were identified as the known substances: 7-Dechlorogriseofulvin, 7-dechlorodehydrogriseofulvin, griseofulvin, dehydrogriseofulvin, 3,13-dihydroxy-5,9,11-trimethoxy-1-methylbenzophenone, griseophenone A, 13-hydroxy-3,5,9,11-tetramethoxy-1-methylbenzophenone and 12-chloro-13-hydroxy-3,5,9,11-tetramethoxy-1-methylbenzophenone. Griseofulvin<PERSON> inhibited the mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum at 2 Âµg mL-1. Thus, the antagonistic effect of S. levispora to S. sclerotiorum may well be due to the presence of griseofulvins. Our results stimulate new work on biosynthesis of griseofulvins, to locate genes that encode key enzymes in these routes, and use them to increase the production of these compounds and thus potentiate the fungicide effect of this fungus. S. levispora represents an agent for biocontrol and griseofulvin a fungicidal to S. sclerotiorum.
