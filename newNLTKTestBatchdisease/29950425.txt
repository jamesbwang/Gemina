 Kaposi<GPE> 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV<ORGANIZATION> ) /Human herpesvirus-8 ( HHV-8 ) causes the angiogenic tumor Kaposi<PERSON> 's Sarcoma<GPE> ( KS ) and two B-cell malignancies. The KSHV<ORGANIZATION> non-structural membrane protein encoded by open reading frame ( orf ) K15 recruits and activates several cellular proteins including PLCγ1<ORGANIZATION>, components of the NF-κB pathway as well as members of the Src<ORGANIZATION> family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and thereby plays an important role in the activation of angiogenic and inflammatory pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of KS as well as KSHV<ORGANIZATION> productive ( lytic ) replication. In order to identify novel cellular components involved in the biology of pK15<ORGANIZATION>, we immunoprecipitated pK15<ORGANIZATION> from KSHV-infected endothelial cells and identified associated proteins by label free quantitative mass spectrometry. Cellular proteins interacting with pK15<ORGANIZATION> point to previously unappreciated cellular processes such as the endocytic pathway that could be involved in the function of pK15<ORGANIZATION>. We found the class II PI3K, PI3K-C2α, which is involved in the endocytosis of activated receptor tyrosine kinases and their signaling from intracellular organelles, to interact and co-localize with pK15<ORGANIZATION> in vesicular structures abundant in the perinuclear area. Further<PERSON> functional analysis revealed that PI3K-C2α contributes to the pK15-dependent phosphorylation of PLCγ1<ORGANIZATION> and Erk1/2. PI3K-C2α also plays a role in KSHV<ORGANIZATION> lytic replication as evidenced by the reduced expression of viral lytic genes K-bZIP and ORF<ORGANIZATION> 45 as well as the reduced release of infectious virus in PI3K-C2α -depleted KSHV-infected endothelial cells. Taken together, our results suggest a role of the cellular PI3K-C2α protein in the functional properties of the KSHV<ORGANIZATION> pK15<ORGANIZATION> protein.
