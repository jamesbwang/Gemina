 Homeostatic<GPE> regulation of class II programmed cell death/autophagy for the degradation and elimination of substandard organelles and defective proteins is decisive for the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Chaperone-mediated autophagy ( CMA<ORGANIZATION> ), one of the most highly dedicated self-sacrificing events, is accountable for the partial elimination of redundant soluble cytoplasmic proteins in Parkinson<GPE> 's disease ( PD ). CMA<ORGANIZATION> is characterized by the selective delivery of superfluous protein containing lysine-phenylalanine-glutamate-arginine-glutamine ( KFERQ<ORGANIZATION> ) /KFERQ-like motif to the lysosome through molecular chaperones, such as heat shock cognate-70 ( Hsc-70 ). KFERQ/KFERQ-like motif present in the poor quality cytoplasmic substrate protein and Hsc-70 complex is recognized by a janitor protein, which is referred to as the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2A ( LAMP-2A ). This protein is known to facilitate an entry of substrate-chaperone complex in the lumen for hydrolytic cleavage of substrate and elimination of end-products. Impaired CMA<PERSON> is repeatedly blamed for an accumulation of surplus soluble proteins. However, it is still an enigma if CMA<ORGANIZATION> is a bonus or curse for PD<ORGANIZATION>. Case-control studies and cellular and animal models have deciphered the contribution of impaired CMA in PD. Current article updates the role of CMA<ORGANIZATION> in toxicant models and recapitulates the evidences that have highlighted a link between impaired CMA<ORGANIZATION> and PD<ORGANIZATION>. Although PD<ORGANIZATION> is an irreversible happening and CMA<ORGANIZATION> is a dual edging phenomenon, it is anticipated that fine-tuning of the latter encounters the former to a certain extent. Besides, the truth, embellishment, and propaganda regarding the issue are also emphasized in the final segment of the article.
