 Hyperhomocysteinemia<GPE> has been associated with different pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and breast cancer ( BC ). To examine the differences in total homocysteine ( tHcy<ORGANIZATION> ) plasma levels, we compared healthy women to BC patients from a Mexican<GPE> population. The tHcy<ORGANIZATION> plasma levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector in 89 female controls and 261 BC patients. The observed plasma tHcy<ORGANIZATION> levels were significantly higher among the BC<ORGANIZATION> patients ( 11.1019 ± 5.9161 µmol/l ) compared to the controls ( 9.1046 ± 1.3213 µmol/l ) ( p = 0.002 ), and these differences were evident when stratified by age ( ≥ 50 years old ), menopause status, overweight and obesity, miscarriages, node metastases, progression, subtype classification ( luminal, Her2<PERSON> and triple negative ) and nonresponse to chemotherapy. The tHcy<ORGANIZATION> plasma levels could be a good marker for the progression and chemosensitivity of BC in the analyzed sample from a Mexican<GPE> population.
