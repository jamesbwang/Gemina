 Sickle<GPE> cell disease ( SCD<ORGANIZATION> ) is an inherited blood disorder that results in a lifetime of anemia, severe pain, and end-organ damage that can lead to premature mortality. While the SCD<ORGANIZATION> field has made major medical advances, much needs to be done to improve the quality of care for people with SCD<ORGANIZATION>. This study capitalizes on the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium<ORGANIZATION> ( SCDIC<ORGANIZATION> ), a consortium of eight academic sites aiming to test implementation strategies that could lead to more accelerated application of the NHLBI<ORGANIZATION> guidelines for treating SCD<ORGANIZATION>. This report documents the process to support the consortium by specifying the interventions being developed. This study consists of three steps. The Principal<ORGANIZATION> Investigator of each site and two site representatives who are knowledgeable of the intervention ( e.g., study coordinator or the person delivering the intervention ) will answer an online survey aiming to capture components of the interventions. This survey will be completed by the site representatives three times during the study: during the development of the interventions, after one year of the interventions being implemented, and at the end of this study ( after 2 years ). A site visit and semi-structured interview ( Step<ORGANIZATION> 2 ) in the first year of the process will capture the context of the sites. Step 3 comprises of the development of a framework with the details of the multi-component SCDIC<ORGANIZATION> interventions at the sites. The outcome of this study, a framework of the SCDIC<ORGANIZATION>, will enable accurate replication and extension of published research, facilitating the translation of SCD<ORGANIZATION> studies to diverse populations and settings and allowing for theory testing of the effects of the intervention components across studies in different contexts and for different populations.
