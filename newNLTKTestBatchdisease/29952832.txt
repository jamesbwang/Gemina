 The aim of this study was to give an update on the emerging role of PET<ORGANIZATION> using radiolabelled amino acids in the diagnostic workup and management of patients with cerebral gliomas and brain metastases. Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential of PET<ORGANIZATION> using radiolabelled amino acids for differential diagnosis of brain tumours, delineation of tumour extent for treatment planning and biopsy guidance, differentiation between tumour progression and recurrence versus treatment-related changes, and for monitoring of therapy. The Response Assessment<ORGANIZATION> in Neuro-Oncology ( RANO<ORGANIZATION> ) working group - an international effort to develop new standardized response criteria for clinical trials in brain tumours - has recently recommended the use of amino acid PET<ORGANIZATION> imaging for brain tumour management in addition to MRI<ORGANIZATION> at every stage of disease. With the introduction of F-18 labelled amino acids, a broader clinical application has become possible, but is still hampered by the lack of regulatory approval and of reimbursement in many countries. PET using radiolabelled amino acids is a rapidly evolving method that can significantly enhance the diagnostic value of MRI<ORGANIZATION> in brain tumours. Current developments suggest that this imaging technique will become an indispensable tool in neuro-oncological centres in the near future.
