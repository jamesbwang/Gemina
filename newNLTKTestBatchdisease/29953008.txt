 Laryngeal<GPE> cysts are rare lesions that may occur at any mucosa-lined location within the larynx. Papillomas are also benign lesions of the larynx. We report a 34 year-old-patient with a laryngeal cyst incidentally found during screening endoscopy and presenting as a soft tissue mass on a computerized tomography scan. A papilloma concomitant with the cyst was detected intraoperatively. Concomitant tonsillar cyst and papilloma of the larynx. The lesion was completely resected with a bipolar radiofrequency plasma ablation ( RFA<ORGANIZATION> ) device. Pathologic<PERSON> examination showed a tonsillar cyst and papilloma in the larynx. Six months later, there has been no evidence of recurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a concomitant tonsillar cyst and a papilloma in the larynx. Asymptomatic laryngeal cysts can be detected endoscopically. RFA<ORGANIZATION> is safe and effective for endoscopic management.
