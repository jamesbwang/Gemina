 Papular<GPE> acantholytic dyskeratosis ( PAD<ORGANIZATION> ), sometimes referred to as PAD<ORGANIZATION> of the vulvocrural or anogenital area, is an exceedingly rare skin condition, which usually presents in adulthood and features multiple, asymptomatic or pruritic, skin-colored to whitish papules, located in the groin area. PAD<ORGANIZATION> exhibits histological features resembling Darier<PERSON> disease ( DD ) or Hailey-Hailey disease ( HHD<ORGANIZATION> ), including acantholysis, dyskeratosis as well as hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, but differs from these disorders by absence of family history and confinement of the lesions Although previously suggested to be a mosaic form of DD<ORGANIZATION>, several studies have demonstrated that PAD<ORGANIZATION> is caused by mutations in the ATP2C1<ORGANIZATION> gene, encoding the Golgi<ORGANIZATION> hSPCA1<ORGANIZATION> pump, which is defective in HHD<ORGANIZATION>, thus suggesting PAD<ORGANIZATION> is a variant of HHD<ORGANIZATION> or that the two diseases belong to the same clinical spectrum.
