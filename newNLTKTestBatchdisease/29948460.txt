 GDSL-type esterase/lipase ( GELP<ORGANIZATION> ) is mainly characterized by a conserved GDSL<ORGANIZATION> domain at N terminus, and is widely found in all living species, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. GELP<ORGANIZATION> gene family consists of a wide range of members playing important roles in plant physiological processes, such as development, stress responses, and functional divergences. In our study, 597 GELP<ORGANIZATION> genes were identified from six Rosaceae genomes ( i.e., Fragaria<GPE> vesca, Prunus<GPE> persica, Prunus<GPE> avium, Prunus<GPE> mume, Pyrus<GPE> bretschneideri, and Malus<GPE> domestica ) by a comprehensive analysis. All GELP genes were further divided into ten subfamilies based on phylogenetic tree analysis. Subfamily D<PERSON> and subfamily E are the two largest subfamilies. Microcollinearity<PERSON> analysis suggested that WGD/segmental events contribute to the expansion of the GELP<ORGANIZATION> gene family in M. domestica and P. bretschneideri compared to F. vesca, P. persica, P. avium, and P. mume. Some PbGELPs were expressed during the fruit development of P. bretschneideri and pollen tubes, indicating their activity in these tissues. The expression divergence of PbGELP<ORGANIZATION> duplication gene pairs suggests that many mutations were allowed during evolution, although the structure of GELP<ORGANIZATION> genes was highly conserved. The current study results provided the feasibility to understand the expansion and evolution patterns of GELP<ORGANIZATION> in Rosaceae<GPE> genomes, and highlight the function during P. bretschneideri fruits and pollen tubes development.
