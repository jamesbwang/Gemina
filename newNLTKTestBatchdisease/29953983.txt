 The study was designed to identify putative Chikungunya<GPE> virus ( CHIKV<ORGANIZATION> ) receptor/s on C6/36 cells that facilitate viral entry. The virus overlay protein binding assay ( VOPBA<ORGANIZATION> ) was adopted to identify CHIKV-interacting bands present in C6/36 cell membrane and identity of the protein was established by mass spectrometry. The role of this protein as a putative CHIKV<ORGANIZATION> receptor on C6/36 cells was confirmed by infection inhibition assay. Cell<PERSON> surface localization of the identified protein was studied by indirect immunofluorescence assay ( IFA<ORGANIZATION> ) on nonpermeabilized cells and by flow cytometry. Interaction between this protein and CHIKV<ORGANIZATION> was confirmed by co-immunoprecipation ( Co-IP ) and Western<GPE> blotting. The effect of depletion of the identified protein by quercetin was demonstrated by infection inhibition assay. A 70-kDa protein was identified as a CHIKV-interacting protein by VOPBA<ORGANIZATION>. MALDI-TOF analysis followed by homology search revealed that this protein could be heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC<ORGANIZATION> 70 ). Anti-HSC 70 antibodies blocked CHIKV<ORGANIZATION> entry into C6/36 cells in a dose-dependent manner. IFA<ORGANIZATION> and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated HSC<ORGANIZATION> 70 localization on C6/36 cell surface. Co-IP experiments confirmed the interaction between HSC<ORGANIZATION> 70 and CHIKV<ORGANIZATION> envelope. Quercetin- and YM-01-treated C6/36 cells exhibited dose-dependent infection inhibition. HSC 70 serves as a putative CHIKV<ORGANIZATION> receptor on C6/36 cells.
