 Nanostructured lipid carriers in-gel ( NLCs-gel ) were prepared to enhance and improve the ocular delivery of dexamethasone. Materials<PERSON> & methods: NLCs containing dexamethasone prepared by high-pressure homogenization were characterized and dispersed into thermosensitive gels ( Pluronic F127<ORGANIZATION> and F68<PERSON> as gels material ). In vitro drug release studies, ocular irritation tests, ex vivo corneal penetration and drug dynamics of NLCs<ORGANIZATION> and NLCs-gel were evaluated in aqueous humor. NLCs-gel exhibited a rapid sol-gel transition at 34.4Â°C and presented nano-sized, narrowly distributed particles. Corneal<PERSON> penetration studies revealed steady sustained drug release ( Ritger-Peppas ) ; NLCs-gel increased ocular bioavailability by prolonging precorneal retention time and improving corneal permeation. These findings suggest developing NLCs-gel for potential treatment of posterior segment eye diseases.
