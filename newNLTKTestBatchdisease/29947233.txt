 Levels of circulating miRNA<ORGANIZATION> are considered to be potential biomarkers of acute myocardial infarction and disease progression. In this study, the expression levels of circulating miRNA-1, miRNA-133 and miRNA-124a were investigated in a group of patients with acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI<ORGANIZATION> ) and cardiogenic shock ( CS ) compared to controls. During the hospitalization period, miRNA-133 showed a significant up-regulation in the serum of STEMI<ORGANIZATION> and CS<ORGANIZATION> patients compared to controls, while the expression of miRNA-1 was significantly different only in CS. The expression of miRNA-124 was significantly higher in STEMI<GPE> and CS<ORGANIZATION>. Furthermore, miRNA-1 expression was related to the level of circulating glucose in patients with STEMI<ORGANIZATION>. We also found a negative correlation between miRNA-133 and MMP-9 levels. MiRNA-124 expression was significantly related to the level of soluble ST2<ORGANIZATION> ; the marker correlated to cardiac damage. All selected miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> are potential markers of cardiac injury in cardiogenic shock, whereas miRNA-124a and -133 are markers of injury in STEMI<GPE>. MiRNA-1 expression is related to circulating glucose in STEMI<GPE>. None of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> could be correlated to the extent of injury, progress of the disease, or prognosis of patient outcome. Therefore, the levels of circulating miRNA have no potential for becoming a biomarker of myocardial damage and as such would bring no further benefit compared to current markers ( Tab<ORGANIZATION>. 4, Fig<PERSON>. 1, Ref<PERSON>. 47 ).
