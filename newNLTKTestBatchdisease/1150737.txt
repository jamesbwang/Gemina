 Iatrogenic<GPE> arteriovenous fistula is a unique complication during pacemaker implantation. A 55-year-old man was posted for pacemaker implantation for recurrent unexplained syncope with trifascicular AV block. After axillary/subclavian venous puncture and introduction of RV<ORGANIZATION> lead, arterial spurting was immediately noticed as the the sheath was peeled away. After dissecting the overlying pectoralis muscle, deep sutures and manual compression achieved hemostasis. However, Subclavian<GPE> arteriogram revealed an arteriovenous fistula from a lateral thoracic artery branch to the innominate vein. Hilal<PERSON> coils were deployed near the fistulous orifice, leading to complete resolution of the leak. After 3 days, pacemaker was implanted from right side. A multidisciplinary approach was the key to successful outcome.
