 Porcine<GPE> reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( PRRS<ORGANIZATION> ), caused by the PRRS<ORGANIZATION> virus ( PRRSV<ORGANIZATION> ), is a widespread disease that affects domestic pigs of all ages. Accurate and rapid detection of PRRSV<ORGANIZATION> specific neutralizing antibodies levels in a pig herd is beneficial for the evaluation of the herd 's immunity to combat the specific viral infection. However, the current methods for viral detection, including fluorescent focus neutralization ( FFN<ORGANIZATION> ) and cytopathic effect ( CPE<ORGANIZATION> ) reduction neutralizing assays, are subjective and time-consuming. Therefore, a Clover-tagged PRRSV<ORGANIZATION> virus neutralization assay were developed that instrumentally measures the fluorescence signal of Clover<GPE> stably expressing by a PRRSV<ORGANIZATION> infectious clone for at least 10 passages. Herein<PERSON>, the results showed that the proposed Clover-tagged PRRSV neutralization assay is reliable using instrumental measurements of the fluorescence signal of Clover<GPE> and allows for rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies against PRRSV<ORGANIZATION>. The assay was evaluated by testing swine sera from experimental and field samples, and comparisons were made with the traditional FFN<ORGANIZATION> and CPE<ORGANIZATION> reduction assays. These results suggest that the Clover-tagged PRRSV infectious clone offers a fast and reliable testing method for neutralizing antibodies and could permit high-throughput screening of new antiviral agents.
