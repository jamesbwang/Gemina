 The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical features and laboratory factors that are predictive of intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG<ORGANIZATION> ) -resistant Kawasaki<PERSON> disease. Multiple databases were searched for relevant studies on IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease published from January 2002 to April 2017. Eligible studies were retrieved by manual review of the references. Stata 12 was used for the meta-analysis. Weighted mean differences and odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for several indices. Twenty-eight studies involving 26,260 patients comprising 4442 IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease patients and 21,818 IVIG-sensitive Kawasaki disease patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR<ORGANIZATION> ) in the IVIG-resistant group was significantly higher than that in the IVIG-sensitive group, and that platelet count and hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in the IVIG-resistant group. The patients with oral mucosa alterations, cervical lymphadenopathy, swelling of the extremities, polymorphous rash, and initial administration of IVIG<ORGANIZATION> ≤ 4.0 days after the onset of symptoms were more likely to be IVIG<ORGANIZATION> resistant. The initial administration of IVIG<ORGANIZATION> ≤ 4.0 days after the onset of symptoms increased ESR<ORGANIZATION> and decreased hemoglobin and platelet counts, oral mucosa alterations, cervical lymphadenopathy, swelling of the extremities, and polymorphous rash and are the risk factors for IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease. What is Known: • Recent reports on this topic are about aspartate aminotransferase ( AST<ORGANIZATION> ), alanine aminotransferase ( ALT<ORGANIZATION> ), gammaglutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, white blood cells, platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR<ORGANIZATION> ), polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMN<ORGANIZATION> ), C-reactive protein ( CRP<ORGANIZATION> ), pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP<ORGANIZATION> ), albumin, and sodium as the risk factors in the IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease ; however, no studies have been published on clinical features as predictors of IVIG<ORGANIZATION> resistance. What is New<GPE>: • This meta-analysis identified the clinical features, the initial administration of IVIG<ORGANIZATION> ≤ 4.0 days after the onset of symptoms, and much more comprehensive laboratory indicators, such as hemoglobin, as predictors of IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease.
