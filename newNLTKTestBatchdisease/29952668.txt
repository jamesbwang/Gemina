 LIGHT<GPE> ( homologous to lymphotoxins, exhibiting inducible expression, and competing with herpes simplex virus ( HSV<ORGANIZATION> ) glycoprotein D for herpes virus entry mediator ( HVEM<ORGANIZATION> ), a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes ) has been involved in various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. LIGHT<ORGANIZATION> induces the expression of interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ), which is up-regulated in chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU<ORGANIZATION> ). To determine circulating soluble LIGHT concentration and its relationship with IL-8 concentration in patients with CSU<ORGANIZATION>. Concentrations of LIGHT<ORGANIZATION>, IL-8, and C-reactive protein ( CRP<ORGANIZATION> ) were determined in plasma or serum of CSU<ORGANIZATION> patients by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LIGHT plasma concentration was significantly higher in moderate-severe CSU<ORGANIZATION> patients as compared with the healthy subjects, but not with mild CSU<ORGANIZATION> patients. There were significant correlations between increased LIGHT<ORGANIZATION> and IL-8 concentrations, but not with increased CRP<ORGANIZATION> in CSU<ORGANIZATION> patients. Enhanced<PERSON> plasma concentrations of soluble LIGHT<ORGANIZATION> and its association with IL-8 concentration suggest the role of LIGHT<ORGANIZATION> in systemic inflammatory activation in CSU<ORGANIZATION> patients. We hypothesize that LIGHT-mediated immune-inflammatory response plays a role in severe phenotypes of the disease.
