 Functional depletion of the alternative splicing factors Muscleblind-like ( MBNL<ORGANIZATION> 1 and 2 ) is at the basis of the neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy type 1 ( DM1<ORGANIZATION> ). We previously showed the efficacy of miRNA<ORGANIZATION> downregulation in Drosophila<GPE> DM1 model. Here, we screen for miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> that regulate MBNL1<ORGANIZATION> and MBNL2<ORGANIZATION> in HeLa<ORGANIZATION> cells. We thus identify miR-23b and miR-218, and confirm that they downregulate MBNL<ORGANIZATION> proteins in this cell line. Antagonists of miR-23b and miR-218 miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> enhance MBNL<ORGANIZATION> protein levels and rescue pathogenic missplicing events in DM1<ORGANIZATION> myoblasts. Systemic delivery of these `` antagomiRs '' similarly boost MBNL<ORGANIZATION> expression and improve DM1-like phenotypes, including splicing alterations, histopathology, and myotonia in the HSA<ORGANIZATION>
