 Based on histopathology and molecular genetics, ovarian carcinomas are divided into five main types: high-grade serous ( 70 % ), endometrioid ( 10 % ), clear cell ( 10 % ), mucinous ( 3 % ), and low-grade serous ( < 5 % ) carcinomas. These tumors, which account for over 95 % of cases, represent distinct diseases with different prognosis and treatments. TP53<ORGANIZATION> mutations are identified in almost all ( 96 % ) high-grade serous carcinomas ( HGSCs<ORGANIZATION> ). Early p53 loss followed by BRCA<ORGANIZATION> loss leads to deficiency in homologous recombination ( DHR<ORGANIZATION> ) repair, which in turn triggers chromosomal instability and widespread somatic copy number changes. An undetermined number of cases of HGSCs<ORGANIZATION> originate in the tubal fimbria ; however, an origin from the ovarian surface epithelium can not be totally excluded. Low-grade serous carcinomas ( LGSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) most likely represent progression of SBTs<ORGANIZATION>. BRAF<ORGANIZATION> or KRAS<ORGANIZATION> mutations occur in one-third to one-half of cases. Mucinous carcinomas ( MCs<ORGANIZATION> ) typically show benign-appearing, borderline, non-invasive and invasive components indicating tumor progression. KRAS<ORGANIZATION> mutations occur in 43.6 % of cases and overexpression/amplification of HER2<ORGANIZATION> in 18.8 %. Endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas ( EC<ORGANIZATION> and CCC<ORGANIZATION> ) originate from ovarian endometriosis. Compared with their uterine counterparts, ECs<ORGANIZATION> have a similar frequency of beta-catenin abnormalities but lower rate of microsatellite instability ( MI ) and PTEN<ORGANIZATION> alterations. ARID1A<ORGANIZATION> mutations occur in both ECs ( 30 % ) and CCCs<ORGANIZATION> ( 50 % ) and may be encountered in adjacent endometriosis. CCCs carry inactivating PTEN<ORGANIZATION> mutations and activating mutations in PIK3CA<GPE> in 8 % and 33 % of cases, respectively. This review summarizes recent advances in the molecular pathology which have greatly improved our understanding of the biology of ovarian carcinomas and are also relevant to patient management.
