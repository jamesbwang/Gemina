 Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ), which accounts for 85-90 % of primary liver cancer, is the fifth most common malignant tumor and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, but the pathological mechanism of HCC<ORGANIZATION> is still not fully elucidated. miRNAs are evolutionarily endogenous small noncoding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> that negatively regulate gene expression via posttranscriptional inhibition or target mRNA<ORGANIZATION> degradation in several diseases, especially human cancer. Therefore, discovering the roles of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> is appealing to scientific researchers. Emerging evidence has shown that the aberrant expressions of numerous miRNAs are involved in many HCC<ORGANIZATION> biological processes. In hepatocarcinogenesis, miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> with dysregulated expression can exert their function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on their cellular target during the cell cycle, and in tumor development, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and progression of the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we summarize current findings on miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> and assess their functions to explore the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression in HCC<ORGANIZATION>.
