 Rheumatology<GPE> and dermatology are two medical disciplines, which are closely interwoven with each other. Frequent direct areas of cooperation are with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, connective tissue diseases and vasculitis. As a whole, chronic inflammatory diseases are frequently associated with cutaneous manifestations and require a specialized dermatological treatment. The diagnosis and treatment of adverse cutaneous reactions to systemic rheumatological treatment creates an additional area requiring a collaborative effort. The close cooperation between rheumatology and dermatology clinics, beeing established in many institutions, has many advantages for our patients, especially in those with a complex course of the disease. Furthermore, it presents a valuable opportunity to learn from each other. The successful establishment of inflammation centers in some larger hospitals is proof for the development of an intensified interdisciplinary treatment of patients.
