 To estimate the vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) of quadrivalent influenza vaccine, I conducted a test-negative case control study in children, based on the rapid influenza diagnostic test ( RIDT<ORGANIZATION> ), during the 2016-2017 season. Overall, the adjusted VE was significant for any influenza ( influenza A + B ) ; VE: 30.2 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ]: 5.4-48.4 ) and influenza B: 48.2 % ( 95 % CI: 11.3-69.7 ). The participants were divided into three age groups ( group A: 0-4 years old, group B: 5-9 years old, and group C: 10-15 years old ) ; in group A, the adjusted VE of quadrivalent influenza vaccine was significant for any influenza ( A + B ): 58.6 % ( 95 % CI: 28.8-76.0 ), influenza A: 53.9 % ( 95 % CI: 16.4-74.6 ), and influenza B: 78.6 % ( 95 % CI: 23.6-94.0 ). In both groups B and C, VE<ORGANIZATION> was not observed for any of the types of influenza. In only group A, two doses of vaccines provided significantly better VE against any influenza, as well as both influenzas A and B, than single-dose vaccines and cases in which vaccination was not administered. In conclusion, quadrivalent influenza vaccine showed significant VE and dose-dependent VE against any influenza and both influenzas A and B, in children aged 0-4 years during the 2016-2017 season. Both the VE<ORGANIZATION> and dose-dependent VE were almost not observed in older group. However, this may due to low rate of vaccination, particularly in children aged 10-15 years.
