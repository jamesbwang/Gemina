 Tumor<GPE> relapse and metastatic spreading act as major hindrances to achieve complete cure of breast cancer. Evidence suggests that cancer stem cells ( CSC<ORGANIZATION> ) would function as a reservoir for the local and distant recurrence of the disease, due to their resistance to radio- and chemotherapy and their ability to regenerate the tumor. Therefore, the identification of appropriate molecular targets expressed by CSC<ORGANIZATION> may be critical in the development of more effective therapies. Our studies focused on the identification of mammary CSC<ORGANIZATION> antigens and on the development of CSC-targeting vaccines. We compared the transcriptional profile of CSC-enriched tumorspheres from an Her2
