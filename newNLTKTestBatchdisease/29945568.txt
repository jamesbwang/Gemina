 Acetylcholinesterase<GPE> inhibitor insecticides ( AChEIIs<ORGANIZATION> ) were used extensively in the agrarian region of Anuradhapura<GPE> for the past few decades. As a result, the region faced a heightened risk of toxicity. Carbaryl<PERSON>, carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, and fenthion were the five hazardous AChEIIs<ORGANIZATION> banned from Anuradhapura<GPE> in 2014. Assessment of post-ban trends in acute poisoning will reveal the impact of the ban. Data<PERSON> on availability and sales of remaining AChEIIs<ORGANIZATION> will guide towards preventive measures against related toxicities. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted at Anuradhapura<ORGANIZATION> district of Sri Lanka<ORGANIZATION>. Details<PERSON> related to acute AChEII<ORGANIZATION> poisoning were sorted from the Teaching Hospital Anuradhapura<ORGANIZATION>. Main<PERSON> insecticide vendors in Anuradhapura<GPE> were surveyed to find information on availability and sales of AChEIIs<ORGANIZATION>. Chi-square for goodness of fit was performed for trends in acute poisoning and sales. Hospital<ORGANIZATION> admissions related to acute AChEII<ORGANIZATION> poisoning have declined from 554 in 2013 to 272 in 2017. Deaths related to acute AChEII<ORGANIZATION> poisoning have declined from 27 in 2013 to 13 in 2017. Sales of all five banned AChEIIs<ORGANIZATION> had reduced by 100 %. Sales of the remaining AChEIIs<ORGANIZATION> were declining, except for acephate, phenthoate, and profenofos. However, one of the top selling, most frequently abused carbosulfan, had the highest risk of toxicity. Chi-square for goodness of fit showed a significance ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) between the trends of hospital admissions for acute AChEII<ORGANIZATION> poisoning and the sales related to AChEIIs<ORGANIZATION>. Hospital<ORGANIZATION> admissions related to acute poisoning was declining along with the overall sales of remaining AChEIIs<ORGANIZATION>, during the post-AChEII ban period. Nevertheless, future vigilance is needed on the remaining AChEIIs<ORGANIZATION> to predict and prevent related toxicities.
