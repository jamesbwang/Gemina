 We assessed safety and tolerability of treatment with pirfenidone ( 1602-2403 mg/day ) and nintedanib ( 200-300 mg/day ) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF<ORGANIZATION> ) .This 24-week, single-arm, open-label Phase IV<PERSON> study ( NCT02598193<ORGANIZATION> ) enrolled patients with IPF<ORGANIZATION> with forced vital capacity ( FVC<ORGANIZATION> ) ≥50 % and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity ( DLco<ORGANIZATION> ) ≥30 %. Before initiating nintedanib, patients had received pirfenidone for ≥16 weeks and tolerated a stable dose of ≥1602 mg/day for ≥28 days. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients who completed 24 weeks of combination treatment on pirfenidone ( 1602-2403 mg/day ) and nintedanib ( 200-300 mg/day ). Investigators recorded treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs<ORGANIZATION> ), attributing them to pirfenidone, nintedanib, both or neither.Eighty-nine patients were enrolled ; 73 completed 24 weeks of treatment ( 69 meeting the primary endpoint ) and 16 discontinued treatment prematurely ( 13 due to TEAEs<ORGANIZATION> ). Seventy-four patients had 418 treatment-related TEAEs, of which diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most common. Two patients had serious treatment-related TEAEs.Combined pirfenidone and nintedanib use for 24 weeks was tolerated by the majority of patients with IPF<ORGANIZATION> and associated with a similar pattern of TEAEs<ORGANIZATION> expected for either treatment alone. These results encourage further study of combination treatment with pirfenidone and nintedanib in patients with IPF<ORGANIZATION>.
