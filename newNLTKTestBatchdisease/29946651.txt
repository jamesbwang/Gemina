 To investigate the clinical effect of concentrated growth factor ( CGF<ORGANIZATION> ) in oral cavity repair. From February 2013 to February 2016 in our hospital, 60 patients with insufficient bone underwent dental implantation. CGF<ORGANIZATION> was used alone in 27 patients ( CGF<ORGANIZATION> group ), CGF<ORGANIZATION> was used with autologous bone or bone material in 33 patients ( CGF<ORGANIZATION> mixed group ). Bone<PERSON> repair was observed and evaluated. SPSS19.0 software package was used for statistical analysis. Wound healing time in CGF<ORGANIZATION> group and CGF<ORGANIZATION> mixed group ( 8.43±0.72 ) d and ( 8.04±0.98 ) d, wound healing rate was 92.60 % in CGF<ORGANIZATION> group and 90.91 % in CGF<ORGANIZATION> group, the difference was not statistically significant ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ) ; Implant<GPE> success rate in CGF<ORGANIZATION> group and CGF<ORGANIZATION> mixed group was 92.31 % and 96.36 %, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). CGF<ORGANIZATION> has good effect in repair of bone defect, and the long-term effect is stable. It is a simple and safe material for bone regeneration.
