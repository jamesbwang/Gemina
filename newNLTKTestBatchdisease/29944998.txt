 Long-term outcome data for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy ( CEA<ORGANIZATION> ) are lacking. As most of the published literature on CEA outcomes has been from high volume providers, we wanted to investigate the outcomes of an averagevolume cerebrovascular neurosurgeon. We reviewed a single neurosurgeon 's experience with CEA<ORGANIZATION> focusing on long term outcomes. Most procedures ( 99.0 % ) were performed with primary closure of the arteriotomy. We studied 192 CEAs, performed from 1998 to 2017 ( 77 % for symptomatic disease ). Two patients ( 1 % ) experienced immediate post-operative strokes. During an average follow-up of 53 months ( 0-205 ), two ( 1 % ) more patients experienced ipsilateral carotid circulation strokes and five ( 2.6 % ) experienced ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks ( TIA<ORGANIZATION> 's ). Five patients ( 2.6 % ) experienced contralateral TIA<ORGANIZATION> 's, and six ( 3.1 % ) contralateral strokes. There were also three ( 1.6 % ) hemorrhagic and six ( 3.1 % ) vertebrobasilar circulation strokes. The rates of ipsilateral stroke free survival for 5, 10 and 15 years after the procedure were 98.4 %, 97.9 %, and 97.9 % respectively. The rates of ipsilateral restenosis free survival for 5, 10 and 15 years after the procedure were 97.9 %, 96.8 %, 96.8 % respectively. A total of six patients ( 3.1 % ) experienced restenosis over 70 % during follow-up. Two of these patients underwent carotid artery stenting. Almost all patients ( > 95 % ) were maintained on an antiplatelet medication and statin. In an average-volume cerebrovascular neurosurgeon 's hands, CEA<ORGANIZATION> can provide durable protection from recurrent stroke in the ipsilateral carotid distribution that extends beyond 15 years. This procedure should, therefore, be considered the gold-standard against which other revascularization modalities should be evaluated.
