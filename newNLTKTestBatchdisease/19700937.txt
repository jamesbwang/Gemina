 Management of advanced/recurrent low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma ( LGOSC<ORGANIZATION> ) is often challenging. Effective treatment options remain limited for hormone and chemotherapy-resistant LGSOC.CASE: A 65-year-old woman with recurrent widespread LGSOC harboring the KRAS-G12 V hotspot mutation experienced a dramatic clinical response to Binimetinib<GPE> ( MEK162<ORGANIZATION> ), a mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MEK<ORGANIZATION> ) inhibitor, after failing multiple chemotherapy and hormonal treatments. An 81 % reduction of target lesions by RECIST<ORGANIZATION> 1.1 over 31 months of response duration was confirmed with serial CT scans. Episodes of drug-related toxicity ( pneumonitis ) easily resolved without sequelae with the use of oral steroids. Binimetinib<PERSON> may present a new treatment option for hormone- and chemotherapy-resistant LGSOC<ORGANIZATION> harboring
