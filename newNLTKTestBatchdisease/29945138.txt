 The aim of this study was to evaluate the cariogenicity of a milk-based drink intended for older adults that was used as part of a governmental initiative in Chile<GPE> to improve their nutritional conditions. This drink contains a high concentration of sugars, which can contribute to root caries development. To test this hypothesis, an experimental biofilm/caries model was used. Dentin<PERSON> slabs were used to grow biofilms of Streptococcus<GPE> mutans UA159<ORGANIZATION>. Slabs/biofilms were exposed 3Ã— per day to bovine milk with different fat content, the milk-based drink, and the milk-based drink supplemented with 10 g of sucrose added per serving. Slabs<PERSON> exposed to 10 % sucrose or 0.9 % NaCl<ORGANIZATION> were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Biofilms<PERSON> were analyzed for bacterial counts and acidogenicity. Dentin<PERSON> demineralization was estimated by the loss of surface microhardness and integrated mineral loss. Results were compared by analysis of variance and Tukey<PERSON> 's test. The milk-based drink showed higher acidogenicity than milk with its entire ( whole ) or reduced total fat content ( skim ). The milk-based drink supplemented with -sucrose had similar acidogenicity as the 10 % sucrose positive control ( p = 0.506 ). Whole milk exposure elicited lower bacterial counts than the positive control, the milk-based drink, and the milk-based drink supplemented with sucrose ( p = 0.002 ; 0.006 and 0.014 respectively ). Although skim milk induced higher demineralization than whole milk, both milk types produced lower demineralization than the milk-based drink. Regarding integrated mineral loss, demineralization induced by the milk-based drink and the milk-based drink supplemented with sucrose was similar to that induced by the positive control and skim milk ( p > 0.05 ). Sugar-containing milk-based drinks used as dietary supplements for older adults may be highly cariogenic and could represent a potential risk for root caries.
