 Atherosclerosis<GPE>, a multifactorial chronic disease, is the main cause of death and impairment in the world. Endothelial cells ( ECs<ORGANIZATION> ) apoptosis plays a crucial role in the onset and development of atherosclerosis, whereas the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. MicroRNA-142-3p ( miR-142-3p ) is a well-defined tumor suppressor in several types of cancer, while the role of miR-142-3p in ECs<ORGANIZATION> apoptosis and the development of atherosclerosis has yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-142-3p in ECs<ORGANIZATION> apoptosis during atherosclerosis and the underlying mechanism. Human<PERSON> aortic endothelial cells ( HAECs<ORGANIZATION> ) were treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( ox-LDL ). The expression level of miR-142-3p was detected using qRT-PCR. Apoptosis<PERSON> was determined via flow cytometry and Caspase-3 activity assay. Prediction of the binding between miR-142-3p and 3'-UTR of Rictor<GPE> mRNA was performed by bioinformatics analyses and confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. The effects of miR-142-3p on endothelial apoptosis and atherosclerosis were further analyzed in an in vivo model using ApoE-/- mice fed with high-fat diet ( HFD<ORGANIZATION> ). MiR-142-3p expression was substantially up-regulated during the ox-LDL-elicited apoptosis in HAECs<GPE>. Forced expression of miR-142-3p exacerbated apoptosis in ECs<ORGANIZATION> whereas inhibition of miR-142-3p could partly alleviate apoptotic cell death mediated by ox-LDL. Further analysis identified Rictor<PERSON> as a direct target of miR-142-3p, and Rictor<PERSON> knockdown abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of miR-142-3p inhibitor. Moreover, the Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS<ORGANIZATION> ) signaling pathway was found to mediate the beneficial effect of miR-142-3p inhibitor on endothelial apoptosis. Finally, systemic treatment with miR-142-3p antagomir attenuated endothelial apoptosis and retarded the progression of atherosclerosis in the aorta of ApoE-/- mice. Down-regulation of miR-142-3p inhibited ECs<ORGANIZATION> apoptosis and atherosclerotic development by up-regulating the expression of Rictor<PERSON> and activating the Akt/eNOS signaling pathway. This indicates that miR-142-3p may be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.
