 The mechanisms that regulate fetal hemoglobin ( HbF<ORGANIZATION> ) expression in sickle cell disease ( SCD<ORGANIZATION> ) remain elusive. We previously showed that steady-state SCD<ORGANIZATION> patients with high HbF<ORGANIZATION> levels due to a To further investigate the role of leukocytes in HbF<ORGANIZATION> expression in SCD<ORGANIZATION>, we examined the presence of HbF<ORGANIZATION> silencing factors in the serum of 82 SCD patients who received hydroxyurea ( HU ) therapy. HU-mediated HbF<ORGANIZATION> induction was associated with elevated total hemoglobin levels and improved red blood cell parameters, but there was no correlation with reticulocyte or platelet counts. Importantly, we again found that HU-induced HbF levels correlated with reductions in both neutrophils and lymphocytes/monocytes, indicating that these cell lineages may have a role in regulating HU-mediated HbF<ORGANIZATION> expression. Our in vitro studies using CD34 Together<ORGANIZATION>, these results demonstrate the importance of leukocyte numbers in the regulation of HbF<ORGANIZATION> levels for SCD<ORGANIZATION> patients both in steady state and under HU<ORGANIZATION> therapy, and that leukocytes secrete HbF silencing factors that negatively affect HbF<ORGANIZATION> expression in erythroid-lineage cells in SCD<ORGANIZATION>.
