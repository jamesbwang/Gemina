 Synaptic<GPE> refinement improves synaptic efficiency, which provides a possibility to improve memory in Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ). In the current study, we aimed to investigate the role of L-theanine, a natural constituent in green tea, in hippocampal synaptic transmission and to assess its potential to improve memory in transgenic AD mice. Initially, we found that L-theanine bath application facilitated hippocampal synaptic transmission and reduced paired-pulse facilitation ( PPF<ORGANIZATION> ). These effects were blocked by antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors and the dopamine D1/5 receptor, and a selective protein kinase A ( PKA<ORGANIZATION> ) inhibitor. Moreover, L-theanine enhanced PKA<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation via dopamine D1/5 receptor activation. L-theanine did not influence hippocampal long-term potentiation ( LTP<ORGANIZATION> ) in the slices obtained from wild-type mice, but rescued the impairment of hippocampal LTP in AD<GPE> mice. Importantly, systemic application of L-theanine also improved memory and hippocampal LTP in AD<GPE> mice. Our results demonstrate that L-theanine administration promotes hippocampal dopamine and noradrenaline release, and stimulates PKA<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation. Moreover, the rescued hippocampal LTP in AD<GPE> mice could be impaired by a PKA<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor. Our data reveal that L-theanine ameliorates the impairment of memory and hippocampal LTP in AD<GPE> mice, likely through dopamine D1/5 receptor-PKA pathway activation. These data warrant the consideration of L-theanine as a candidate for the treatment of AD<ORGANIZATION>.
