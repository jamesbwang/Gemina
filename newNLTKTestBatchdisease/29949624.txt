 Trauma<GPE> is predicted to become the third leading cause of death in India<GPE> by 2020, which indicate the need for urgent action. Trauma scores such as the international classification of diseases injury severity score ( ICISS<ORGANIZATION> ) have been used with great success in trauma research and in quality programmes to improve trauma care. To this date no valid trauma score has been developed for the Indian<GPE> population. This retrospective cohort study used a dataset of 16047 trauma-patients from four public university hospitals in urban India<GPE>, which was divided into derivation and validation subsets. All injuries in the dataset were assigned an international classification of disease ( ICD<ORGANIZATION> ) code. Survival Risk Ratios<PERSON> ( SRRs<ORGANIZATION> ), for mortality within 24 hours and 30 days were then calculated for each ICD-code and used to calculate the corresponding ICISS<ORGANIZATION>. Score<PERSON> performance was measured using discrimination by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ( AUROCC<ORGANIZATION> ) and calibration by calculating the calibration slope and intercept to plot a calibration curve. Predictions of 30-day mortality showed an AUROCC<ORGANIZATION> of 0.618, calibration slope of 0.269 and calibration intercept of 0.071. Estimates of 24-hour mortality consistently showed low AUROCCs<ORGANIZATION> and negative calibration slopes. We attempted to derive and validate a version of the ICISS<ORGANIZATION> using SRRs<ORGANIZATION> calculated from an Indian<GPE> population. However, the developed ICISS-scores overestimate mortality and implementing these scores in clinical or policy contexts is not recommended. This study, as well as previous reports, suggest that other scoring systems might be better suited for India<GPE> and other Low- and middle-income countries until more data are available.
