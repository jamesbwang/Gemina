 This study examined the prevalence, characteristic features, and complications associated with the occurrence of unerupted permanent incisors among children and adolescents attending a university dental teaching hospital. A retrospective review was performed of the clinical records of children and adolescents who attended the Prince Philip Dental Hospital<ORGANIZATION>, Hong Kong<GPE> between 2005 and 2014. All patients who had at least one unerupted permanent incisor tooth were included. A total of 266 subjects with 320 unerupted permanent incisors were identified. The prevalence of unerupted permanent incisors among children and adolescents was 2.0 %. Permanent maxillary central incisors ( 70.6 % ) were the most commonly affected teeth. The most common cause for unerupted incisors were dilacerations ( n = 83, 36.7 % ) for maxillary central incisors ; developmental dental anomalies ( n = 22 ; 30.6 % ) together with unfavorable root development ( n = 22 ; 30.6 % ) for maxillary laterals incisors ; and abnormal tooth/tissue ratio ( n = 11, 50.0 % ) for mandibular incisors. A majority of unerupted incisors presented with complications the most common being ectopic/displacement/rotation of the unerupted incisors ( 46.6 % ), loss of space ( 36.9 % ) and midline shift ( 27.5 % ). In conclusion, the causes were distinct for different manifestations of unerupted permanent incisors. As the majority of unerupted incisors presented with complications, a systematic and organized method of history taking as well as clinical and radiographic examinations is mandatory in the diagnosis of unerupted permanent incisors.
