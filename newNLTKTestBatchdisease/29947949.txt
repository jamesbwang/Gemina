 An unrecognized latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI<ORGANIZATION> ) may be reactivated under immunosuppressive therapy and become life threatening. Diagnosing LTBI<ORGANIZATION> requires the combination of targeted patient history and physical examination with the results of an interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRA<ORGANIZATION> ) and in addition, a chest Xâ€‘ray is needed to rule out active tuberculosis. Established therapies for LTBI<ORGANIZATION> reduce the reactivation risk by approximately 80 %. For the initial screening of an HBV<ORGANIZATION> infection HBsAg<ORGANIZATION> and anti-HBc are determined. Hereby<PERSON>, HBsAg<ORGANIZATION> carriers ( high HBV<ORGANIZATION> reactivation risk, indications for antiviral prophylaxis ) and serologically resolved HBV<ORGANIZATION> infections ( low HBV<ORGANIZATION> reactivation risk, use of prophylaxis only in high-risk immunosuppression ) can be reliably detected. A previously unrecognized HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection, with an increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis during immunosuppression, can be detected in screening by anti-HCV antibodies and be successfully treated with antivirals without interferon.
