 Previous UK studies investigating nontuberculous mycobacteria have been limited to reporting isolation from culture, not burden of disease. We assessed the burden of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease ( NTMD<ORGANIZATION> ) in UK primary care from 2006 to 2016. Using electronic healthcare records, we identified patients with NTMD<ORGANIZATION> using a strict definition including patients with guideline-directed treatment/monitoring. We described treatment regimens and incidence/prevalence in the general population and in patients with underlying chronic respiratory diseases. Incidence of primary care-managed NTMD in the general population decreased ( 2006 to 2016 rates per 100,000 person-years, 3.85 to 1.28 ). Average annual prevalence of NTMD<ORGANIZATION> in the general population was 6.38 per 100,000. Around 85 % were taking antimycobacterial therapy ; 53.2 % were taking a guideline-recommended regimen. Incidence of NTMD<ORGANIZATION> in patients with respiratory disease decreased ( 2006 to 2016 rates per 100,000 person-years, 12.5 to 7.40 ). Average annual prevalence of NTMD<ORGANIZATION> in patients with respiratory disease was 27.7 per 100,000. This is the first UK study using nationally representative data to investigate the burden of NTMD<ORGANIZATION> managed within primary care. Incidence and prevalence of managed NTMD<ORGANIZATION> within primary care is gradually declining. Increasing complexity in the management of NTMD<ORGANIZATION> may be driving a shift in care to secondary settings.
