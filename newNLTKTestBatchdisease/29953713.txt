 Only a few studies have addressed liver stiffness dynamics after hepatitis C virus ( HCV<ORGANIZATION> ) treatment in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. The aim was to evaluate the variation in liver stiffness and in serum liver fibrosis scores in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients before and after treatment with direct-acting antivirals ( DAAs<ORGANIZATION> ). Liver<PERSON> stiffness measured using transient elastography as well as serum liver fibrosis scores [ fibrosis-4 ( FIB-4 ) score and the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index ( APRI<ORGANIZATION> ) ] were evaluated before and at 6-12 months after DAA<ORGANIZATION> treatment. Variation in the outcome variables was evaluated using the Wilcoxon<ORGANIZATION> nonparametric test. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> analysis and multivariate regression models were used. A total of 78 HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects were included in the study. Median<GPE> values of hepatic stiffness significantly decreased after DAA<ORGANIZATION> treatment compared with baseline [ 16.8 ( interquartile range ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> ) 10.2-27.0 ) kPa at baseline vs. 9.4 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 6.7-15.0 ) kPa after DAA<ORGANIZATION> treatment ; P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). Further<PERSON>, a decrease in median FIB-4 score [ 2.8 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 1.5-4.8 ) vs. 2.0 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 1.3-3.2 ), respectively ; P<PERSON> < 0.01 ] and APRI<ORGANIZATION> [ 0.9 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 0.5-2.2 ) vs. 0.4 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 0.2-0.7 ), respectively ; P<PERSON> < 0.01 ] was found. In univariate analysis, liver stiffness decrease was associated with increasing age, 'other ' HCV<ORGANIZATION> genotype ( vs. G1 ), the presence of cirrhosis, higher pre-DAA liver stiffness, sofosbuvir-based regimens and longer DAA<ORGANIZATION> treatment ( all P < 0.05 ). Multivariate regression confirmed the significance of the association only with higher baseline liver stiffness ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). Greater<PERSON> FIB-4 and APRI<ORGANIZATION> reductions were associated with higher respective baseline values, while the presence of hepatic steatosis correlated with lower score reduction after DAA<ORGANIZATION>. A reduction in liver stiffness and an improvement in fibrosis scores were observed in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients soon after DAA<ORGANIZATION> treatment. The clinical implications of these observations need to be evaluated in larger populations with longer follow-up.
