 Epidemiological<GPE> evidence suggests a link between pesticide exposure and the development of metabolic diseases. However, most experimental studies have evaluated the metabolic effects of pesticides using individual molecules, often at nonrelevant doses or in combination with other risk factors such as high-fat diets. We aimed to evaluate, in mice, the metabolic consequences of chronic dietary exposure to a pesticide mixture at nontoxic doses, relevant to consumers ' risk assessment. A mixture of six pesticides commonly used in France<GPE>, i.e., boscalid, captan, chlorpyrifos, thiofanate, thiacloprid, and ziram, was incorporated in a standard chow at doses exposing mice to the tolerable daily intake ( TDI<ORGANIZATION> ) of each pesticide. Wild-type ( WT ) and constitutive androstane receptor-deficient ( CAR Compared<ORGANIZATION> to those fed control chow, WT<ORGANIZATION> male mice fed pesticide chow had greater BW gain and more adiposity. Moreover, these WT males fed pesticide chow exhibited characteristics of hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance, which were not observed in those fed control chow. WT exposed female mice exhibited fasting hyperglycemia, higher reduced glutathione ( GSH<ORGANIZATION> ): oxidized glutathione ( GSSG<ORGANIZATION> ) liver ratio and perturbations of gut microbiota-related urinary metabolites compared to WT<ORGANIZATION> mice fed control chow. When we performed these experiments on CAR<ORGANIZATION> To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a sexually dimorphic obesogenic and diabetogenic effect of chronic dietary exposure to a common mixture of pesticides at TDI<ORGANIZATION> levels, and to provide evidence for a partial role for CAR<ORGANIZATION> in an
