 Although cirrhosis is a key risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ), mounting evidence indicates that in a subset of patients presenting with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH<ORGANIZATION> ) HCC<ORGANIZATION> manifests in the absence of cirrhosis. Given the sheer size of the ongoing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ) epidemic and the dismal prognosis associated with late-stage primary liver cancer there is an urgent need for HCC<ORGANIZATION> surveillance in the NASH<ORGANIZATION> population. Using serum levels of HCC<ORGANIZATION> biomarkers as vectors and biopsy-proven HCC<ORGANIZATION> or no HCC as outputs / binary classifier, a supervised learning campaign was undertaken to develop a minimally invasive technique for making a diagnosis of HCC<ORGANIZATION> in a clinically relevant model of NASH<ORGANIZATION>. Adult<PERSON> mice randomized to control diet or a fast food diet ( FFD<ORGANIZATION> ) were followed for up to 14 mo and serum level of a panel of HCC-relevant biomarkers was compared with liver biopsies at 3 and 14 mo. Both NAFLD Activity Score<ORGANIZATION> ( NAS<ORGANIZATION> ) and hepatic hydroxyproline content were elevated at 3 and 14 mo on FFD<ORGANIZATION>. Picrosirius<PERSON> red staining of liver sections revealed a filigree pattern of fibrillar collagen deposition with no cirrhosis at 14 mo on FFD<ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, 46 % of animals bore one or more tumors on their livers confirmed as HCC<ORGANIZATION> in hematoxylin-eosin-stained liver sections. In this training set, receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curves analysis for serum levels of the HCC<ORGANIZATION> biomarkers osteopontin ( OPN<ORGANIZATION> ), alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP<ORGANIZATION> ) and Dickkopf-1 ( DKK1<ORGANIZATION> ) returned concordance-statistic/area under ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve of â‰¥ 0.89. Serum levels of OPN<ORGANIZATION> ( threshold, 218 ng/mL ; sensitivity, 82 % ; specificity, 86 % ), AFP<ORGANIZATION> ( 136 ng/mL ; 91 % ; 97 % ) and DKK1<ORGANIZATION> ( 2.4 ng/mL ; 82 % ; 81 % ) diagnostic for HCC<ORGANIZATION> were confirmed in a test set comprising mice on control diet or FFD<ORGANIZATION> and mice subjected to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. These data suggest that levels of circulating OPN<ORGANIZATION>, AFP<ORGANIZATION> and DKK1<ORGANIZATION> can be used to make a diagnosis of HCC<ORGANIZATION> in a clinically relevant model of NASH<ORGANIZATION>.
