 Pseudomonas<GPE> aeruginosa is a common causative bacterium of acute and chronic infections that have been responsible for high mortality over the past decade. P. aeruginosa produces many virulence factors such as toxins, enzymes, and dyes that are strongly dependent on quorum sensing ( QS ) signaling systems. P. aeruginosa has three major QS systems ( las, rhl and Pseudomonas<GPE> quinolone signal ( PQS<ORGANIZATION> ) ) that regulate the expression of genes encoding virulence factors as well as biofilm production and maturation. Antimicrobial blue light ( aBL<ORGANIZATION> ) is considered a therapeutic option for bacterial infections and has other benefits, such as reducing bacterial virulence. Therefore, this study investigated the efficacy of aBL<ORGANIZATION> to reduce P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. aBL<ORGANIZATION> treatment resulted in the reduced activity of certain QS signaling molecules in P. aeruginosa and inhibited biofilm formation. In vivo tests using a Caenorhabditis<ORGANIZATION> elegans infection model indicated that sub-lethal aBL<ORGANIZATION> decreased the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa. aBL may be a new virulence-targeting therapeutic approach.
