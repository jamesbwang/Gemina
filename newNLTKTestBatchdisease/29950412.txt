 Natural<GPE> killer ( NK ) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system capable of killing hazardous cells, including virally infected cells. NK cell-mediated killing is triggered by activating receptors. Prominent among these is the activating receptor NKG2D<ORGANIZATION>, which binds several stress-induced ligands, among them MICA<ORGANIZATION>. Most of the human population is persistently infected with human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV<ORGANIZATION> ), a virus which employs multiple immune evasion mechanisms, many of which target NK cell responses. HCMV<ORGANIZATION> infection is mostly asymptomatic, but in congenitally infected neonates and in immunosuppressed patients it can lead to serious complications and mortality. Here we discover that an HCMV<ORGANIZATION> protein named UL148A<ORGANIZATION> whose role was hitherto unknown is required for evasion from NK<ORGANIZATION> cells. We demonstrate that UL148A-deficient HCMV strains are impaired in their ability to downregulate MICA<ORGANIZATION> expression. We further show that when expressed by itself, UL148A<ORGANIZATION> is not sufficient for MICA<ORGANIZATION> targeting, but rather acts in concert with an unknown viral factor. Using inhibitors of different cellular degradation pathways, we show that UL148A<ORGANIZATION> targets MICA<ORGANIZATION> for lysosomal degradation. Finally, we show that UL148A-mediated MICA<ORGANIZATION> downregulation hampers NK cell-mediated killing of HCMV-infected cells. Discovering the full repertoire of HCMV<ORGANIZATION> immune evasion mechanisms will lead to a better understanding of HCMV<ORGANIZATION> 's ability to persist in the host, and may also promote the development of new vaccines and drugs against HCMV<ORGANIZATION>.
