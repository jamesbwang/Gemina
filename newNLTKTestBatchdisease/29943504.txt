 To validate the enhanced therapeutic effect of Salvia<GPE> miltiorrhiza Bunge<GPE> ( SM ) for brain ischemic stroke through the anti-apoptotic and survival ability of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs<ORGANIZATION> ). The viability and the expression level of cell apoptotic and survival-related proteins in MSCs by treatment of SM were assessed in vitro. In addition, the infarcted brain region and the behavioural changes after treatment of MSCs<ORGANIZATION> with SM<ORGANIZATION> were confirmed in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAo<ORGANIZATION> ) models. We demonstrated that SM<ORGANIZATION> attenuates apoptosis and improves the cell viability of MSCs<ORGANIZATION>. In the rat MCAo<ORGANIZATION> model, the recovery of the infarcted region and positive changes of behaviour are observed after treatment of MSCs<ORGANIZATION> with SM<ORGANIZATION>. The therapy using SM<ORGANIZATION> enhances the therapeutic effect for brain ischemic stroke by promoting the survival of MSCs<ORGANIZATION>. This synergetic effect thereby proposes a new experimental approach of traditional Chinese<GPE> medicine and stem cell-based therapies for patients suffering from a variety of diseases.
