 Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF<ORGANIZATION> ) is involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders in adults and elderly individuals, and as a result, the DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation ( DNAm<ORGANIZATION> ) of the BDNF<ORGANIZATION> gene in peripheral tissues including blood has been extensively examined to develop a useful biomarker for psychiatric disorders. However, studies to date have not previously investigated the effect of age on DNAm<ORGANIZATION> of the BDNF<ORGANIZATION> gene in blood. In this context, we measured DNAm<ORGANIZATION> of 39 CpG units in the CpG<ORGANIZATION> island at the promoter of exon I of the BDNF<ORGANIZATION> gene. We analyzed genomic DNA from peripheral blood of 105 health Japanese<GPE> women 20 to 80 years of age to identify aging-associated change in DNAm<ORGANIZATION> of the BDNF<ORGANIZATION> gene. In addition, we examined the relationship between total MMSE<ORGANIZATION> scores, numbers of stressful life events, and serum BDNF<ORGANIZATION> levels on DNAm<ORGANIZATION> of the BDNF<ORGANIZATION> gene. The DNAm<ORGANIZATION> rate at each CpG unit was measured using a MassArray<ORGANIZATION> There was a significant correlation between DNAm<ORGANIZATION> and age in 13 CpGs. However, there was no significant correlation between DNAm<ORGANIZATION> and total MMSE<ORGANIZATION> scores, numbers of life events, or serum BDNF<ORGANIZATION> levels. Despite the small number of subjects and the inclusion of only female subjects, our results suggest that DNAm<ORGANIZATION> of 13 CpGs of the BDNF<ORGANIZATION> gene may be an appropriate biomarker for aging and useful for predicting increased susceptibility to age-related psychiatric disorders.
