 The mechanisms that connect complement system activation and basal deposit formation in early stages of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD<ORGANIZATION> ) are insufficiently understood, which complicates the design of efficient therapies to prevent disease progression. Using human fetal ( hf ) retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE<ORGANIZATION> ) cells, we have established an in vitro model to investigate the effect of complement C3a<ORGANIZATION> on RPE<ORGANIZATION> cells and its role in the formation of sub-RPE deposits. The results of these studies revealed that C3a<ORGANIZATION> produced after C3<GPE> activation is sufficient to induce the formation of sub-RPE deposits via complement-driven proteasome inhibition. C3a<ORGANIZATION> binds the C3a<ORGANIZATION> receptor ( C3aR<ORGANIZATION> ), stimulates deposition of collagens IV and VI<ORGANIZATION> underneath the RPE<ORGANIZATION>, and impairs the extracellular matrix ( ECM<ORGANIZATION> ) turnover by increased MMP-2 activity, all mediated by downregulation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway ( UPP<ORGANIZATION> ). The formation of basal deposits can be prevented by the addition of a C3aR<ORGANIZATION> antagonist, which restores the UPP<ORGANIZATION> activity and ECM<ORGANIZATION> turnover. These findings indicate that the cell-based model can be used to test potential therapeutic agents in vitro. The data suggest that modulation of C3aR-mediated events could be a therapeutic approach for treatment of early AMD<ORGANIZATION>.
