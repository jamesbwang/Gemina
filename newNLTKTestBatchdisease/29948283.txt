 Bullous<GPE> pemphigoid ( BP ) constitutes the most prevalent disease in the group of bullous dermatoses with the autoimmune background. Some authors suggest that certain cytokines ( IL-2, IFN-Î³ ) may be transported by P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ), the product of the ABCB1<ORGANIZATION> gene. ABCB1<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism might affect not only the effectiveness of treatment with drugs that are P-gp substrates but also contribute to the development of diseases, including BP<ORGANIZATION>. In the present work, we resolved to conduct a haplotype analysis of ABCB1<ORGANIZATION> in patients with BP<ORGANIZATION> and to answer the question of whether any of the haplotypes are able to affect the incidence of this entity. The study involved 71 patients with BP<ORGANIZATION> and 100 healthy volunteers. Determination of polymorphisms 1236C > T and 3435C > T in ABCB1<ORGANIZATION> was carried out with the PCR-RFLP ( Polymerase<ORGANIZATION> Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism<PERSON> ) method. The 2677G > T/A ABCB1 polymorphism was analyzed with the allele-specific PCR<ORGANIZATION> method. It was observed that the 1236T-2677G-3435T haplotype occurred with a statistically significantly lower frequency in patients with BP<ORGANIZATION> than in controls ( 1.4 vs. 10.0 % ). Carriers of this haplotype were also shown to have had a low relative risk for BP<ORGANIZATION> ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.13, p = 0.003 ). Haplotype analysis of ABCB1<ORGANIZATION> conducted in patients with BP<ORGANIZATION> demonstrated that the 1236T-2677G-3435T haplotype may protect against development of this entity.
