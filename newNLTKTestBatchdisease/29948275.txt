 The aim of this double-blind, randomized trial was to evaluate the 1-year clinical performance of a bulk-fill flowable and a regular nanofilled composite in non-carious cervical lesions ( NCCLs<ORGANIZATION> ). Twenty-two subjects with at least two NCCLs were enrolled in the study. A total of 89 restorations were performed by a single operator using Filtek Supreme<PERSON> ( FS ) Ultra Universal<PERSON> or Filtek Bulk<PERSON> ( FB ) Fill Flowable<PERSON>. A universal adhesive ( Scotchbond™ Universal Adhesive ) was used with a self-etching approach in dentin. The restorations were evaluated by two independent and previously calibrated examiners at baseline ( 7 days ), 6 months and 1 year, according to the USPHS<ORGANIZATION> modified criteria. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the differences between composites and Wilcoxon<PERSON> signed rank test for comparisons between the baseline and follow-ups ( α = 5 % ). One restoration was considered clinically unacceptable due to loss of retention after 6 months in the FS<ORGANIZATION> group. FS presented statistically high scores for surface roughness when compared to FB after 1 year ( p < 0.05 ), but both were considered clinically acceptable. After 1 year, the frequency of clinically unacceptable rates was 3.3 % for anatomical form in the FB<ORGANIZATION> group, 1.1 % for retention in the FS<ORGANIZATION> group, and 2.2 % for marginal adaptation in both groups. All restorations, in both groups, presented score 0 over the 1-year period for marginal staining, postoperative sensitivity, and secondary caries. Both composite resins showed acceptable clinical performances for the restoration of NCCLs<ORGANIZATION> after 1 year. Both bulk-fill flowable and regular nanofilled composites showed good clinical performances for the restoration of NCCLs<ORGANIZATION> after 1 year.
