 No data are available about the effect of MS on oral nucleos ( t ) ide analogues ( NUCs<ORGANIZATION> ) treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic hepatitis B ( CHB<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. We aimed to elucidate whether coexistence of MS and CHB<ORGANIZATION> affects the long-term prognosis of CHB<ORGANIZATION> patients with oral NUCs<ORGANIZATION> treatment. We performed a retrospective data analysis for a total of 587 CHB patients who started oral NUCs<ORGANIZATION> treatment for the first time in our institution from January 2006 to March 2016. Among the 587 patients, 70 ( 11.9 % ) had MS, but 517 ( 88.1 % ) had no evidence of MS when oral NUCs<ORGANIZATION> treatment was initiated. Cumulative occurrence rates of viral breakthrough, genotypic resistance, HCC<ORGANIZATION>, disease progression ( PD ), and overall adverse outcomes ( OAO<ORGANIZATION> ) were significantly higher in CHB<ORGANIZATION> patients with MS than in those without MS, although HBV-DNA suppression and cumulative occurrence rates of HBeAg<ORGANIZATION> negative conversion and seroconversion were not significantly different between the two groups. The overall survival ( OS ) was also significantly shorter in CHB<ORGANIZATION> patients with MS than in those without MS. Multivariate analysis indicated that the MS was an independent, poor prognostic factor for occurrence of genotypic resistance ( adjusted hazard ratio [ aHR ], 22.3 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 6.61-75.02 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), HCC<ORGANIZATION> ( aHR<ORGANIZATION>, 3.98 ; 95 % CI 2.07-7.66 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), PD<GPE> ( aHR<ORGANIZATION>, 6.18 ; 95 % CI 3.43-11.14 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), OAO<ORGANIZATION> ( aHR<ORGANIZATION>, 8.10 ; 95 % CI 4.68-14.02 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), and OS<ORGANIZATION> ( aHR<ORGANIZATION>, 12.29 ; 95 % CI 2.25-67.24 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). MS is an independent determinant of poor prognosis in CHB<ORGANIZATION> patients receiving oral NUCs<ORGANIZATION> treatment.
