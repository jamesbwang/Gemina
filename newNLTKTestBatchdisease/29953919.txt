 Ribosome<GPE>: machinery in control of messenger RNA<ORGANIZATION> 's ( mRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) and several ribosomal proteins are in the small and large subunit of the ribosome. Various aspects of ribosomal proteins have related to cell growth, cell cycle, and diseases. Ribosomal<PERSON> protein L10A<GPE> ( RpL10A<ORGANIZATION> ) in shrimp and fruit fly has been demonstrated to play a role in oogenesis. Interestingly, deletion RpL10A<ORGANIZATION> gene ( RpL10Ab<ORGANIZATION>
