 Long<GPE> non-coding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) are emerging as novel diagnostic markers of prostate cancer ( PCa<ORGANIZATION> ) and new determinants of castration-resistant PCa<ORGANIZATION> ( CRPC<ORGANIZATION> ), an aggressive and metastatic form of PCa<ORGANIZATION>. In addition to androgen receptor ( AR ) signaling, neuroendocrine differentiation ( NED<ORGANIZATION> ) is associated with CRPC<ORGANIZATION>. Recent reports demonstrate that the downregulation of repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor ( REST<ORGANIZATION> ) protein is a key step in NED<ORGANIZATION> of PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells. Here, we report HOTAIR<ORGANIZATION> as a novel REST-repressed lncRNA that is upregulated in NED<ORGANIZATION> PCa cells and in CRPC<GPE>. HOTAIR<ORGANIZATION> overexpression is sufficient to induce, whereas knockdown of HOTAIR<ORGANIZATION> suppressed NED<ORGANIZATION> of PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells. Gene ontology ( GO ) analysis of differentially expressed genes under HOTAIR<ORGANIZATION> overexpression and in CRPC<GPE> versus benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH<ORGANIZATION> ) suggests that HOTAIR<ORGANIZATION> may participate in PCa<ORGANIZATION> progression. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence of lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> HOTAIR<ORGANIZATION> as a driver for NED<ORGANIZATION> of PCa<ORGANIZATION> cells.
