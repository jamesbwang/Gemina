 The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha ( CEBPA<ORGANIZATION> ) is lineage-specific transcription factor in the hematopoietic system. In this study, we aimed on the clinical features and the prognostic significance associated with CEBPA<ORGANIZATION> mutations in 30 pediatric patients with acute leukemia. In addition, the association between found variants and mutations of Ten-Eleven-Translocation 2 ( TET2<ORGANIZATION> ), Kirsten<PERSON> rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS<ORGANIZATION> ), and Casitas<PERSON> B-cell lymphoma ( CBL<ORGANIZATION> ), FLT3<ORGANIZATION> ( Fms-Related Tyrosine Kinase<PERSON> ), JAK2<GPE> ( Januse<ORGANIZATION> Kinase-2 ) and Nucleophosmin 1 ( NPM1<ORGANIZATION> ) were analyzed, which are important prognostic risk factors for pediatric acute leukemia patients. The entire CEBPA<ORGANIZATION> coding region was screened using the NGS<ORGANIZATION> method. CEBPA mutations were detected in 16 ( 53.3 % ) of 30 patients. In total, ten distinct of nucleotide changes were identified in 30 patients, including 6 novel and 4 known mutations by sequencing the entire CEBPA<ORGANIZATION> gene. We found 6 frame shift mutations, 1 missense mutation, 3 synonymous variants. The most common mutation was the c.487del G resulting p.Glu163Ser in 5 cases. Three patients carried CEBPA<ORGANIZATION> double mutations. The detected variants in this article seemed to be the first screening results of genes studied by NGS<ORGANIZATION> in pediatric acute leukemia patients. Our results also showed some degree of association between FLT3-ITD, TET2<ORGANIZATION>, KRAS<ORGANIZATION>, CBL<ORGANIZATION> and CEBPA<ORGANIZATION> mutations ( Tab<ORGANIZATION>. 4, Fig<PERSON>. 1, Ref<PERSON>. 24 ).
