 Cocoa<GPE> black pod disease caused by Phytophthora<PERSON> megakarya and reduced soil fertility are major constraints to cocoa production resulting in high yield losses. In the absence of effective control measures and constraints related to the use of chemical fungicides and fertilizers, there is a need to develop additional and sustainable disease and fertilization management strategies. With the lack of studies related to the use of compost in cocoa cultivation, the present study aims to evaluate the potential of cocoa pod husk ( CPH<ORGANIZATION> ) -based compost as a soil amendment to reduce the severity of cocoa black pod disease and enhance plant growth. In vitro antagonism test showed that compost water extracts ( CWE<ORGANIZATION> ) reduced mycelial growth with inhibition rate reaching 100 % associated with microorganisms. Disease<PERSON> score of cocoa plantlets grown on compost-amended soils significantly reduced compared to plantlets grown on non-amended soil ( control ). All compost rates tested significantly increased populations of actinomycetes and fungi and biological activity in the soil. Compost<ORGANIZATION> application increased soil pH and majority of the essential elements but decreased Al<PERSON> content, which is toxic to cocoa growth in acidic soils. Soil<PERSON> application of compost at the dose of 20 % ( v/v ) significantly increased stem length and number of leaves compared to the control. This study shows that CPH-based compost can not only improve soil fertility and cocoa growth but also reduce cocoa black pod disease severity by direct effects on inoculums level in the soil and by inducing resistance in the plant.
