 Expanded newborn screening ( ENBS<ORGANIZATION> ) utilizing tandem mass spectrometry ( MS/MS ) for inborn metabolic diseases ( IMDs<ORGANIZATION> ), such as organic acidemias ( OAs<ORGANIZATION> ), fatty acid oxidation disorders, ( FAODs<ORGANIZATION> ), and amino acid disorders ( AAs<ORGANIZATION> ), is increasingly popular but has not yet been introduced in many Asian<GPE> countries. This study aimed to determine the incidence rates of OAs<ORGANIZATION>, FAODs<ORGANIZATION>, and AAs<ORGANIZATION> in Asian<GPE> countries and Germany<GPE> using selective screening and ENBS<ORGANIZATION> records. Selective screening for IMDs<ORGANIZATION> using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and MS/MS was performed among patients suspected to be afflicted in Asian<GPE> countries ( including Japan<GPE>, Vietnam<GPE>, China<GPE>, and India<GPE> ) between 2000 and 2015, and the results from different countries were compared. Similarly, ENBS<ORGANIZATION> results from Japan<GPE>, South Korea<GPE>, Taiwan<GPE>, and Germany<GPE> were compared. Additionally, the results of selective screening and ENBS<ORGANIZATION> in Japan<GPE> were compared. Among 39,270 patients who underwent selective screening, IMDs<ORGANIZATION> were detected in 1170. Methylmalonic acidemia was frequently identified in several countries, including Japan<GPE> ( 81/377 diagnosed IMDs<ORGANIZATION> ), China<GPE> ( 94/216 IMDs ), and India<GPE> ( 72/293 IMDs ). In Vietnam<GPE>, however, Î²-ketothiolase deficiency was particularly frequent ( 33/250 IMDs ). ENBS<ORGANIZATION> yielded differences in overall IMD<ORGANIZATION> rates by country: 1:8557 in Japan<GPE>, 1:7030 in Taiwan<GPE>, 1:13,205 in South Korea<GPE>, and 1:2200 in Germany<GPE>. Frequently discovered diseases included propionic acidemia ( PPA<ORGANIZATION> ) and phenylketonuria ( PKU<ORGANIZATION> ) in Japan<GPE>, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency ( MCCD<ORGANIZATION> ) and PKU<ORGANIZATION> in Taiwan<GPE>, MCCD<ORGANIZATION> and citrullinemia type I in South Korea<GPE>, and PKU<ORGANIZATION> and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in Germany<GPE>. Furthermore, in Japan<GPE>, selective screening and ENBS<ORGANIZATION> yielded respective PPA<ORGANIZATION> frequencies of 14.7 % and 49.4 % among all organic acidemias. The incidence rates of IMDs<ORGANIZATION> vary by country. Moreover, the disease spectra of IMDs<ORGANIZATION> detected via selective screening differ from those detected via ENBS<ORGANIZATION>.
