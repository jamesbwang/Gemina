 To evaluate the Risk of Endometrial Cancer<ORGANIZATION> ( REC<ORGANIZATION> ) scoring system for the prediction of high and low probability of endometrial cancer ( EC ) in women with postmenopausal bleeding ( PMB<ORGANIZATION> ). Prospective study ( Canadian<GPE> Task Force<ORGANIZATION> classification II-1 ). Academic<PERSON> hospital. Nine<PERSON> hundred and fifty consecutive patients with PMB<ORGANIZATION> underwent transvaginal ultrasonography ( TVS<ORGANIZATION> ) and REC<ORGANIZATION> scoring between November 2013 and December 2015. Obstetrics and gynecology residents, supervised by trained physicians, scored endometrial patterns according to the previously established REC<ORGANIZATION> scoring system. The reference standard was endometrial samples, endometrial thickness ( ET<ORGANIZATION> ; 4-4.9 mm ), operative hysteroscopy, or hysterectomy ( ET<ORGANIZATION> ≥5 mm ), and one-year follow-up in all patients presenting with ET<ORGANIZATION> < 4 mm. Diagnostic<PERSON> performance for prediction of probability of malignancy was assessed using the REC<ORGANIZATION> scoring system. The area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) of the TVS<ORGANIZATION> REC score system was 97 % ( range: 95-98 ) for prediction of malignancy. In 656 patients with ET<ORGANIZATION> ≥4 mm, REC<ORGANIZATION> scoring effectively predicted high probability of malignancy: sensitivity ( 95 % confidence interval ): 92 % ( range: 87 % -95 % ) ; specificity: 94 % ( range: 91 % -96 % ). An REC score of 0 was present in 206 ( 32 % ) patients with ET<ORGANIZATION> ≥4 mm and was associated with a low negative likelihood ratio of 0.026 for EC<ORGANIZATION>. Only 7 patients with EC/atypical hyperplasia were seen among these 206 patients. The REC<ORGANIZATION> scoring system identified or ruled out most ECs<ORGANIZATION>, clearly demonstrating that more specific image analysis at first-line TVS can accelerate the diagnosis of EC in patients with PMB<ORGANIZATION> and may allow for improved selection of second-line strategies in patients with ET<ORGANIZATION> ≥4 mm.
