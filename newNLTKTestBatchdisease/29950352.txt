 Although somatostatin analogues ( SSA<ORGANIZATION> ) and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT<ORGANIZATION> ) are validated therapies in patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ( GEP-NETs ), it remains unclear whether SSA<ORGANIZATION> combined with PRRT<ORGANIZATION> or as maintenance therapy can provide prolonged survival compared to patients treated with PRRT<ORGANIZATION> alone. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate whether there is a survival benefit to adding SSA<ORGANIZATION> to PRRT<ORGANIZATION> as a combination therapy and/or maintenance therapy. The investigation included 168 patients with unresectable GEP-NETs treated at the University Hospital Bonn<ORGANIZATION>, Germany<GPE>. The patients were divided into two main groups: PRRT monotherapy ( N=81, group 1 ) and PRRT<ORGANIZATION> plus SSA<ORGANIZATION> ( N=87, group 2 ) as combined therapy with PRRT<ORGANIZATION> and/or as maintenance therapy after PRRT<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> for overall survival ( OS ) were available from 168 patients, of whom 160 had data for progression-free survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ). The median PFS<ORGANIZATION> was 27 months in group 1 vs. 48 months in group 2 ( p = 0.012 ). The median OS rates were 47 months in group 1 and 91 months in group 2 ( p & lt ; 0.001 ). The death-event rates were lower in group 2 ( 26 % ) than in group 1 ( 63 % ). SSA as a combination therapy with PRRT<ORGANIZATION> and/or as a maintenance therapy showed a clinical benefit rate ( objective response or stable disease ) of 95 %, which was significantly higher than group 1 ( 79 % ). SSA as a combination therapy and/or maintenance therapy may play a significant role in tumor control in patients with GEP-NET who underwent a PRRT<ORGANIZATION>.
