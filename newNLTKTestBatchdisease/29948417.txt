 Peritoneal<GPE> carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer is a stage 4 disease for which palliative chemotherapy has traditionally been considered the mainstay of treatment. Since the development of cytoreductive surgery ( CRS<ORGANIZATION> ) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC<ORGANIZATION> ) by Sugarbaker<PERSON>, this combined method treatment has resulted in improved survival outcomes with acceptable morbidity for selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. This study examined the cost effectiveness of CRS<ORGANIZATION> and HIPEC<ORGANIZATION> compared with palliative chemotherapy for patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer within the context of the Singaporean<GPE> health care system. A retrospective review of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from histologically proven colorectal cancer treated at the National Cancer Centre Singapore<ORGANIZATION> ( NCCS<ORGANIZATION> ) was conducted. The average cost of CRS<ORGANIZATION> and HIPEC<ORGANIZATION> per patient was S $ 83,680.26, and the median overall survival period was 47 months. The calculated cost per life year attained for a patient who underwent CRS<ORGANIZATION> and HIPEC<ORGANIZATION> was S $ 21,365.19 per life year. In comparison, the average cost of palliative chemotherapy was S $ 44,478.87, with a median overall survival of 9 months, and the calculated cost per life year attained for a patient in this treatment group was S $ 59,305.16 per life year. The findings show that CRS<ORGANIZATION> and HIPEC<ORGANIZATION> results in prolonged survival for selected patients with colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis and a lower cost per life year attained than for the traditionally used palliative chemotherapy. It should logically be the preferred treatment of choice for selected patients with colorectal peritoneal metastasis.
