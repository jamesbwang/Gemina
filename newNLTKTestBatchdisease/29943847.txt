 Abnormal<GPE> proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs<ORGANIZATION> ) is closely related to hyperplasia in hypertension. Our previous study suggested that adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH<ORGANIZATION> ) is mechano-responsive and may regulate VSMC<ORGANIZATION> proliferation. However, the molecular mechanism of VSMC<ORGANIZATION> abnormal proliferation induced by conditions of high cyclic strain, especially the role of ACTH<ORGANIZATION> in this process, is unclear. Our results revealed that ACTH<ORGANIZATION> and its specific receptor melanocortin receptor type 2 ( MC2R<ORGANIZATION> ) were highly expressed in hypertensive rat models. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the expression of ACTH<ORGANIZATION> and MC2R<ORGANIZATION> was up-regulated when exposed to high cyclic strain in vitro, accompanied by abnormal proliferation of VSMCs<ORGANIZATION>. Next<PERSON>, it was proved that ACTH-dependent cell proliferation was related to the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases ( ERK<ORGANIZATION> ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3<ORGANIZATION> ). The study also found that ACTH<ORGANIZATION> could promote dimerization and glycosylation of melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein ( MRAP<ORGANIZATION> ), which had a significant effect on MC2R<ORGANIZATION> membrane localization and signal activation. When VSMCs<ORGANIZATION> were treated with PD98059<ORGANIZATION>, a mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAP<ORGANIZATION> kinase ) cascade antagonist, it was determined that phosphorylation of STAT3<ORGANIZATION> at Ser727<ORGANIZATION> was dependent on ERK<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation. In summary, these data demonstrated that the abnormal proliferation of VSMCs<ORGANIZATION> induced by conditions of high cyclic strain is in part attributed to ACTH<ORGANIZATION> and its receptor MC2R<ORGANIZATION>. Identifying the mechanism of ACTH-dependent proliferation of VSMCs<ORGANIZATION> may help to provide new therapeutic targets for hypertension.
