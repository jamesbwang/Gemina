 The flexible regulation of cellular metabolic pathways enables cellular adaptation to changes in energy demand under conditions of stress such as posed by a virus infection. To analyze such an impact on cellular metabolism, rubella virus ( RV ) was used in this study. RV replication under selected substrate supplementation with glucose, pyruvate, and glutamine as essential nutrients for mammalian cells revealed its requirement for glutamine. The assessment of the mitochondrial respiratory ( based on oxygen consumption rate, OCR<ORGANIZATION> ) and glycolytic ( based on extracellular acidification rate, ECAR<ORGANIZATION> ) rate and capacity by respective stress tests through Seahorse<GPE> technology enabled determination of the bioenergetic phenotype of RV-infected cells. Irrespective of the cellular metabolic background, RV<ORGANIZATION> infection induced a shift of the bioenergetic state of epithelial ( Vero<ORGANIZATION> and A549<GPE> ) and endothelial ( HUVEC<ORGANIZATION> ) cells to a higher oxidative and glycolytic level. Interestingly there was a RV strain-specific, but genotype-independent demand for glutamine to induce a significant increase in metabolic activity. While glutaminolysis appeared to be rather negligible for RV<ORGANIZATION> replication, glutamine could serve as donor of its amide nitrogen in biosynthesis pathways for important metabolites. This study suggests that the capacity of rubella viruses to induce metabolic alterations could evolve differently during natural infection. Thus, changes in cellular bioenergetics represent an important component of virus-host interactions and could complement our understanding of the viral preference for a distinct host cell population.
