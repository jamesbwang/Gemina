 Prolonged therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA<ORGANIZATION> ) and arsenic trioxide ( ATO<ORGANIZATION> ) is highly effective in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL<ORGANIZATION> ) but there is limited data on the efficacy of this regimen in the relapse setting. We report here on 22 APL patients treated with prolonged ATRA-ATO therapy at the time of disease relapse. Twenty patients obtained molecular complete remission ( CRm<ORGANIZATION> ) after 2 cycles ( 90 % ). Of these, two patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT<ORGANIZATION> ) while the remaining proceeded to receive additional cycles ( up to a total of 5 ) of ATRA-ATO. With a median follow-up of 58 months from the time of relapse ( range: 21-128 months ), the 4-year OS probability was 0.85 ( 95 % CI 0.61-0.94 ), DFS<ORGANIZATION> was 0.74 ( 95 % CI 0.49-0.88 ), and EFS<ORGANIZATION> 0.68 ( 95 % CI 0.45-0.83 ). Two patients were resistant to ATRA-ATO salvage and five relapsed at a median of 19 months. Of these, four died due to progressive disease while three relapsed achieved a new CRm after further salvage therapy. This experience confirms the potentially curative effect of prolonged ATRA-ATO therapy in relapsed APL<ORGANIZATION>, especially in patients with long first complete remission.
