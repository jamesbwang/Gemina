 Lactobacillus<GPE> casei ( L. casei ) is well known for its probiotic property in human and animals. Lactoferricin ( Lfcin ) polypeptide can effectively modulate host immune responses and have antimicrobial activity in vivo and in vitro. In order to develop a food-grade L. casei system constitutively expressing bovine Lfcin<PERSON>, this study constructed a thymidine auxotrophy ( ΔthyA<ORGANIZATION> ) recombinant L. casei. Based on the thymidylate synthase gene ( thyA<ORGANIZATION> ) insert site, LFEC<ORGANIZATION> ( Lfcin<PERSON> expression cassette ) was inserted into L. casei genome through homologous recombination, successfully expressed and could be stably inherited. The recombinant L. casei, ΔthyA<ORGANIZATION> L. casei-LFEC, is sensitive to chloramphenicol and limited when cultured without thymine. Meanwhile, ΔthyA<ORGANIZATION> L. casei-LFEC has both good antibacterial activity against Escherichia<GPE> coli and Staphylococcus<PERSON> aureus and antiviral activity against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( PEDV<ORGANIZATION> ). We successfully constructed a recombinant L. casei strain expressing Lfcin<PERSON>, ΔthyA<ORGANIZATION> L. casei-LFEC, which could only survive in the presence of thymine, and had excellent antimicrobial and antiviral activity with good genetic stability and sensitivity. This research provides a cost-effective alternative to the antibiotics with additional biological functions and wider applicability prospect. Using ΔthyA as the selectable mark instead of antibiotic to construct genetic engineering L.casei provides a safe and effective approach of feed additives in livestock raising.
