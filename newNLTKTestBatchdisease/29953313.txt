 A central goal for reintroduced populations of threatened wood bison ( Bison<PERSON> bison athabascae ) is to maintain them free of diseases of concern, particularly bovine tuberculosis ( caused by Mycobacterium<GPE> bovis ) and brucellosis ( caused by Brucella<PERSON> abortus ). A wood bison population in southwestern Yukon, Canada<PERSON> was reintroduced into the wild in 1988, but no health assessment has been done since then. To provide an initial assessment of the health status and, hence, the conservation value of this population, we serologically tested 31 wood bison ( approximately 3 % of the population ) for pathogens of interest and obtained histopathology results for select tissues. We found no evidence of exposure to M. bovis or Brucella<GPE> spp., but antibodies were present to bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine coronavirus, Leptospira<ORGANIZATION> interrogans, and Neospora<GPE> caninum, with seroprevalences of 87, 7, 61, and 7 % of the tested animals, respectively. Reintroduced wood bison in southwestern Yukon may be of high value for wood bison recovery because it is a large and geographically isolated population with no bacteriologic, histopathologic, or serologic evidence of exposure to Brucella<GPE> spp. or M. bovis.
