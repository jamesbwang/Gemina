 The function of the chicken 's major histocompatibility complex ( MHC<ORGANIZATION> or B complex ) class I major ( BF2<ORGANIZATION> ) and minor ( BF1<ORGANIZATION> ) glycoproteins is compared for their expression, ability to present viral antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs<ORGANIZATION> ), and interaction with natural killer ( NK ) cells. MHC-restricted CTLs<ORGANIZATION> recognized virus antigen in the context of the BF2*21 major glycoprotein but not the BF1*21 minor glycoprotein. Marek<PERSON> 's disease virus ( MDV<ORGANIZATION> ), a large DNA<ORGANIZATION> virus known to reduce the cell surface expression of class I glycoprotein, reduced the expression of BF2<ORGANIZATION> glycoprotein while BF1glycoprotein<ORGANIZATION> expressions are remained as no change or slight increase. In addition, the expression of BF1*21 class I glycoprotein protected target cells from NK<ORGANIZATION> cell lysis while the expression of the BF2*21 class I glycoprotein enhanced NK cell lysis of target cells. Therefore, BF1<ORGANIZATION> and BF2<ORGANIZATION> provide two different cellular immune functions ; BF1<ORGANIZATION> negatively regulates the NK<ORGANIZATION> cell killing activity and BF2<ORGANIZATION> restricts the antigen specific CTL<ORGANIZATION> immune response.
