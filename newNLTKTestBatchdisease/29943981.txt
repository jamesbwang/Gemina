 Tyrosinase<GPE> ( TYR<ORGANIZATION> ), a key enzyme in biosynthesis of melanin, usually functions as a biomarker of severe skin diseases such as vitiligo and melanoma cancer. Accurate detection of TYR<ORGANIZATION> activity in vivo is urgent but still challenging. Inspired by the advantages of bioluminescence in vivo strategy in imaging and the specific hydroxylation of 3-hydroxybenzyloxy group by TYR<ORGANIZATION>, a bioluminogenic probe, TYR-LH2 was designed and synthesized through caging D-luciferin with 3-hydroxybenzyl. The probe exhibits high selectivity and sensitivity towards TYR<ORGANIZATION> with a detection limit of 0.11 U/mL in a small detection vol-ume of 100 Î¼L. Bioluminescence imaging results show that TYR-LH2 is fully competent for monitoring the dynamic chang-es of TYR<ORGANIZATION> in living cells and model animals and possesses the capability of discriminating melanocytes from other cell lines, thus offering a promising approach for investigation and diagnosis of melanoma cancer and other TYR<ORGANIZATION> -related diseases in vivo.
