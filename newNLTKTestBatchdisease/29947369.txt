 Enantiomeric<GPE> carbon dots ( C-dots ) synthesized from l-lysine or d-lysine, modulate aggregation and cytotoxicity of amyloid beta-42 ( Aβ42<ORGANIZATION> ), the primary constituent of the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer<PERSON> 's disease. In particular, l-Lys-C-dots dramatically remodeled Aβ42<PERSON> secondary structure and fibril morphologies, as well as inhibited Aβ42<PERSON> cytotoxicity and membrane interactions.
