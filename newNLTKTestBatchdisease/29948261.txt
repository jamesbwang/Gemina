 This study investigated the relationship between tongue pressure during swallowing and dysphagia in patients with Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease ( PD ). A total of 24 patients with PD<ORGANIZATION> ( 12 men and 12 women, mean age 70.4 years ) were studied. Their mean Hoehn and Yahr<GPE> scale was 3.0 Â± 1.3 ( range 1-5 ). All participants underwent tongue pressure measurement and videofluorography during swallowing. Tongue<PERSON> pressure when swallowing 5 mL of barium on videofluorography was measured using a sensor sheet with five sensors. Based on the findings of videofluorography, the patients were divided into two groups: dysphagic PD<ORGANIZATION> group ( n = 9 ) and non-dysphagic PD<ORGANIZATION> group ( n = 15 ). The maximal magnitude ( kPa<ORGANIZATION> ), duration ( s ), time to peak pressure ( s ), and pressure gradient ( kPa/s ) of tongue pressure were analyzed for each part. For duration, time to peak pressure, and pressure gradient, similar values were calculated from the total waveform. There was no significant difference in maximal tongue pressure between the groups. The dysphagic PD<ORGANIZATION> group had prolonged duration of tongue pressure and time to peak pressure and a reduced pressure gradient compared with the non-dysphagic PD<ORGANIZATION> group. These results indicate that there is a clear difference in the temporal aspects of tongue pressure between the non-dysphagic and dysphagic PD patients. These differences provide the characteristics of tongue movement during swallowing in PD patients with dysphagia, which may be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia.
