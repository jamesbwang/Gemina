 Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis ( ANRE<ORGANIZATION> ) is a potentially lethal disease attributed to auto-antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> ). Full recovery is possible if therapy is initiated early in the disease course. Detection of ANRE<ORGANIZATION> antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF<ORGANIZATION> ) is essential for diagnosis. The assays for ANRE-associated IgGs often rely on cells transiently transfected with NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> genes. A cell line that stably expresses pathogenic NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> epitopes could improve standardization of the assays and provide antigen that could be used in commercial solid state assay systems. We expressed the amino terminal domain ( ATD<ORGANIZATION> ) of the GluN1<ORGANIZATION> NMDAR subunit ( NR1<ORGANIZATION> ) as a fusion protein on the outer plasma membrane of 293T cells, creating a stable cell population ( 293T-ATD ) that is recognized by ANRE<ORGANIZATION> patient monoclonal antibodies in flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays. The ATD<ORGANIZATION> fusion protein also contains a Myc tag and a 6XHIS tag, which provide functionality for immunoassays and antigen purification, and a TEV<ORGANIZATION> protease site, which allows the ATD<ORGANIZATION> domain to be specifically released from the cells in essentially pure form. ATD<ORGANIZATION> mobilized from the 293T ATD cell line maintained the pathogenic ANRE<ORGANIZATION> epitopes in ELISA<GPE> binding assays. CSF ( 3/4 ) and sera ( 4/4 ) from ANRE<ORGANIZATION> patients also bound the 293T-ATD cell line, whereas normal CSF<ORGANIZATION> and sera did not. The 293T-ATD cell line is potentially adaptable to a variety of formats to identify antibodies associated with ANRE<ORGANIZATION>, including cell-based and soluble antigen formats, and demonstrates a useful method to produce complex proteins for research, drug discovery, and clinical diagnosis.
