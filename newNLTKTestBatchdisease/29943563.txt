 Concurrent presentation of acute hepatitis A virus ( HAV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection and Graves<PERSON> ' disease has not been reported in literature worldwide. Although there is no well-established mechanism that explains the induction of Graves<ORGANIZATION> ' disease by HAV<ORGANIZATION> to date, our case suggests that HAV<ORGANIZATION> infection may be responsible for inducing Graves<PERSON> ' disease. A healthy 27-year-old female presented fever, palpitation, and diarrhea, and she was subsequently diagnosed as acute HAV<ORGANIZATION> infection. Concurrently, she showed hyperthyroidism, and the diagnosis was made as Graves<PERSON> ' disease. She had never had symptoms that suggested hyperthyroidism, and previous thyroid function test was normal. Acute HAV<PERSON> infection was recovered by conservative management, however, thyroid dysfunction was maintained even after normalization of liver enzymes. Methimazole<PERSON> was used to treat Graves<PERSON> ' disease. We report a case of concurrent acute HAV<ORGANIZATION> infection and Graves<PERSON> ' disease in a patient without preexisting thyroid disease. This suggests that HAV<ORGANIZATION> infection may be a trigger for an autoimmune thyroid disease in susceptible individuals.
