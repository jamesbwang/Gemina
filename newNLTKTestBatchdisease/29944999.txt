 To clarify the safety and efficacy of flow diverter ( FD ) treatment for blood blister-like aneurysm ( BBA<ORGANIZATION> ), we conducted a systematic review and literature analyzing perioperative and long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes. A comprehensive review of the up-to-date literature for studies with > 2 patients related to FD treatment of BBAs<ORGANIZATION> published was performed. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following outcomes: complete occlusion, technical success, aneurysm recurrence, rebleeding, perioperative mortality, perioperative stroke, procedure-related morbidity and mortality, long-term neurological morbidity and mortality, and overall good neurological outcome. We included 15 non-comparative studies with 165 target BBAs<ORGANIZATION>. Complete occlusion rates were 72 % ( 95 % CI= 0.59-0.85 ). Recurrence<PERSON> occurred in 13 % ( 95 % CI= -0.04-0.29 ) and rebleeding in 3 % ( 95 % CI = -0.02-0.07 ) of patients. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were 26 % ( 95 % CI =0.19-0.33 ) and 3 % ( 95 % CI= -0.01-0.07 ), respectively. Long-term good outcome was 83 % ( 95 % CI = 0.77-0.89 ). Subgroup<PERSON> analysis indicated that single FD strategy for BBA<ORGANIZATION> seemed to have a higher good outcome rate compared to overlapped FD strategy ( 89.9 % versus 61.9 %, OR=1.42, 95 % CI=1.25-14.98, P=0.02 ). Complete occlusion rate and procedure-related morbidity rate did not see any significant difference between these two strategies. Our meta-analysis suggests that in select cases, FD can be safe and effective. Single FD<PERSON> strategy may result in a higher good outcome rate compared to overlapped FD strategy. Ultimately, treatment of BBA<ORGANIZATION> should be considered on a case-by-case basis to maximize patient benefits and limit the risk of perioperative complications.
