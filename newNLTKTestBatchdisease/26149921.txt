 The pathology of Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease ( PD ) is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated α-synuclein ( α-syn ). Protein<PERSON> phosphatase 2A ( PP2A<ORGANIZATION> ) is responsible for α-syn dephosphorylation. Previous work has demonstrated that α-syn can regulate PP2A<ORGANIZATION> activity. However, the mechanisms underlying α-syn regulation of PP2A<ORGANIZATION> activity are not well understood. In this study, we found that α-syn overexpression induced increased α-syn phosphorylation at serine 129 ( Ser129<GPE> ), and PP2A<ORGANIZATION> inhibition,
