 Chronic<GPE> ulcers are a significant cause of morbidity in diabetic patients, which can greatly affect a patient 's quality of life. While numerous methods have been developed to promote and enhance wound healing in diabetic patients, a convenient, effective treatment for diabetic ulcers has yet to be established. Here, we demonstrate the promotion of wound healing using a low-fluence ( 2 mJ/spot ) ablative fractional laser ( AFL<ORGANIZATION> ) treatment in diabetic mice. Treatment<PERSON> was shown to confer increases in mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression and in protein abundance of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF<ORGANIZATION> ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF<ORGANIZATION> ), along with decreases in mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression and protein abundance of transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-Î² ). Taken together, these results suggest that low-fluence AFL<ORGANIZATION> treatment can be used to promote healing in chronic diabetic wounds.
