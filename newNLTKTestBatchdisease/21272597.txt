 TCR/CD3 complex is composed of the disulfide-linked TCR-αβ heterodimer that recognizes the antigen as a peptide presented by the MHC<ORGANIZATION>, and non-covalently paired CD3γε- and δε-chains together with disulfide-linked ζ-chain homodimers. The CD3<ORGANIZATION> chains play key roles in T<GPE> cell development and T cell activation. In the present study, we found nor or extremely lower expression of CD3ε<ORGANIZATION> in head- and trunk-kidney lymphocytes by flow cytometric analysis, while CD3ε<ORGANIZATION> was expressed at the normal level in lymphocytes from thymus, spleen, intestine, gill, and peripheral blood. Furthermore, CD4-1
