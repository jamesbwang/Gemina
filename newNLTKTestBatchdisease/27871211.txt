 The complex endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms and dissections with fenestrated or branched stent grafts ( FB-EVAR ) remains challenging for interventional vascular surgery. To date, the evidence regarding treatment patterns and outcome measures consists of single center studies ; however, it might be reasonable to validate results with multicenter real-world evidence. Health<PERSON> insurance claims data from Germany<GPE> 's third largest insurance provider, DAK-Gesundheit, were used to determine outcomes following FB-EVAR of non-ruptured thoracic aorta ( TA ) or thoracoabdominal including pararenal abdominal ( TAA<ORGANIZATION> ) aorta. The study included patients operated between January 2008 and April 2017. Included were 984 patients ( 18.1 % female ) who underwent FB-EVAR. Patients with treatment of the TA were younger ( 71.7 vs. 73.2 years, In this large-scale German<GPE> analysis of claims data, multicenter real-world evidence was different from single center studies regarding patient risk-factors and outcome measures. Validated multicenter registry studies could help to further investigate this topic in times of increasing procedures.
