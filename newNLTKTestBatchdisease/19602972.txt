 Fluid<GPE> therapy is one of the main issues for hemodynamic resuscitation. Tissue Doppler<PERSON> imaging ( TDI<ORGANIZATION> ) of the right ventricle ( RV ) with bedside ultrasound ( BUS<ORGANIZATION> ) technique is a new dynamic method to identify fluid responsiveness in patients with hypotension. Here, we present the case of a hypotensive patient monitored with TDI<ORGANIZATION> measurements of RV<ORGANIZATION>. A 75-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department ( ED ) with the complaint of diarrhea. He was in severe hypovolemia, with hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. His laboratory results were normal. BUS<ORGANIZATION> was performed on the patient by the ED<ORGANIZATION> physician. The velocity of the excursion of the tricuspid valve measured at presentation was 14.47 cm/s and, together with collapsed inferior vena cava ( IVC<ORGANIZATION> ), this finding led to the decision to begin fluid therapy immediately. The patient underwent 2 L of fluid therapy with 0.9 % NaCl<ORGANIZATION> in a 2-h period. Control BUS<PERSON> after fluid therapy revealed decreased TDI<ORGANIZATION> velocity of tricuspid annulus to 11.81 cm/s and dilated IVC<ORGANIZATION> not collapsing sufficiently with respiration. The patient received his maintenance therapy after admission to the internal medicine department and was discharged from the service after 3 days. TDI in fluid responsiveness may find a clinical role in the future by the clinical studies.
