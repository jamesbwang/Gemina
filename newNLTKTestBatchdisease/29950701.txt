 Bone<GPE> sialoprotein ( BSP<ORGANIZATION> ), a member of the SIBLINGs<ORGANIZATION> ( for Small<PERSON> Integrin-Binding LIgand, N-linked Glycoproteins ) family, has recently be associated to inflammatory and infectious diseases. We therefore measured BSP<ORGANIZATION> concentrations in 136 patients at admission to the intensive care unit ( ICU<ORGANIZATION> ) and 3 days of ICU<ORGANIZATION>. BSP<ORGANIZATION> levels were compared to 36 healthy blood donors and correlated to clinical data. In these analysis, BSP<ORGANIZATION> serum levels were strongly elevated at the time point of admission to the ICU<ORGANIZATION> when compared to healthy controls. Moreover BSP<ORGANIZATION> concentrations were significantly elevated after 3 days of treatment on the intensive care unit. A further increase in BSP<ORGANIZATION> levels was detected in patients with higher APACHE-II-scores and in patients with septic disease. While in most patients, BSP<ORGANIZATION> levels decreased during the first three days of treatment on a medical ICU<ORGANIZATION>, patients with persistently elevated BSP<ORGANIZATION> levels displayed an unfavorable outcome. In these patients, persistently elevated BSP<ORGANIZATION> concentrations were a superior predictor of mortality than established indicators of patientÂ´ prognosis such as the SAPS2<ORGANIZATION> or the APACHE-II score. In summary, our data argue for a novel utility for BSP<ORGANIZATION> as a biomarker in patients treated on a medical ICU<ORGANIZATION>.
