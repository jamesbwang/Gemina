 Adherence<GPE> to long-term therapy for diabetes remains low. Accurately measuring adherence is the primary step in improving adherence. We translated and validated the Sinhalese<GPE> version of the Brief Medication Questionnaire ( BMQ<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with diabetes. The study was conducted at the National Hospital<ORGANIZATION> of Sri Lanka<ORGANIZATION> between April and December 2017, including 165 patients with diabetes. BMQ<ORGANIZATION> was translated into Sinhalese<GPE> using the translation-back translation method. The translated questionnaire validation included evaluation of internal consistency, temporal stability, and performance in regard to a gold standard ( HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> ). Mean age ( ±SD ) was 60.6 ± 11.1 years, and 46.1 % were males. Mean duration of diabetes in the participants was 13.4 ± 7.8 years. Mean HbA1c<PERSON> was 8.3 ± 1.7 %, with poor glycaemic control ( HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 8.5 % ) identified in 41.8 %. Medication adherence measured by the BMQ<ORGANIZATION> regimen, belief, and recall screens were 39.4 %, 75.8 %, and 18.8 %, respectively. In the analysis of temporal stability, the overall BMQ<ORGANIZATION> and the regimen, belief, and recall screens demonstrated good concordance between test and retest with significant gamma correlation coefficients of The translated questionnaire demonstrated good reliability ( internal consistency ), temporal stability ( test-retest reliability ), and validity when assessed using a gold standard for disease control. Using culturally validated tools to evaluate adherence may help clinicians to identify low adherence and institute corrective measures.
