 To date there is no clinically agreed upon diagnostic test for acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS<ORGANIZATION> ): the condition is still diagnosed based on a constellation of clinical findings, laboratory tests and radiological images. Development of ARDS<ORGANIZATION> biomarkers has been in a state of continuous flux during the past four decades. To address ARDS<ORGANIZATION> heterogeneity, several studies have recently focused on subphenotying the disease based on observable clinical characteristics and associated blood biomarkers. However, the strong correlation between identified biomarkers and ARDS<ORGANIZATION> subphenotypes has yet to establish etiology hence the need for the adoption of other methodologies for studying ARDS<ORGANIZATION>. In this review we will shed light on ARDS<ORGANIZATION> metabolomics research in the literature and discuss advances and major obstacles encountered in ARDS<ORGANIZATION> metabolomics research. Generally, the ARDS<ORGANIZATION> metabolomics studies focused on identification of differentiating metabolites for diagnosing ARDS<ORGANIZATION>, but they were performed to different standards in terms of sample size, selection of control cohort, type of specimens collected and measuring technique utilized. Virtually<PERSON> none of these studies have been properly validated to identify true metabolomics biomarkers of ARDS<ORGANIZATION>. Though in their infancy, the metabolomics studies exhibit promise to unfolding the biological processes underlying ARDS<ORGANIZATION> and, in our opinion, have great potential for pushing forward our current understanding of ARDS<ORGANIZATION>.
