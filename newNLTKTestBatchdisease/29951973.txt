 To determine whether the introduction of pasteurized donor human milk and probiotics for infants born < 32 weeks gestational age or < 1500 g birthweight is associated with a reduction in mortality and the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis ( NEC<ORGANIZATION> ) and sepsis. We performed a retrospective analysis of two cohorts: before and after the introduction of probiotics and pasteurised donor human milk. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> analysis of primary and secondary outcomes was performed ; variables impacting outcomes were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. There were 1791 infants: 1334 in the pre-donor milk/probiotic cohort and 457 in the post-donor milk/probiotic cohort. On univariate analysis, mortality ( 7.6 vs. 2.4 %, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) and incidence of sepsis ( 6.2 vs. 3.5 %, P<PERSON> = 0.028 ) were statistically significantly lower in the post-donor milk/probiotic group. NEC ( 2.8 vs. 1.5 %, P<PERSON> = 0.14 ) and non-NEC associated gastrointestinal perforation ( 1.6 vs. 0.4 %, P<PERSON> = 0.052 ) were lower in the post-donor milk/probiotics cohort, but these were not statistically significant. The difference in mortality remained statistically significant on multivariate analysis in the post-donor milk/probiotic cohort compared to those in the pre-donor milk/probiotic cohort ( odds ratio 0.31, 95 % confidence interval 0.16-0.61 ). The decrease in the incidence of NEC<ORGANIZATION> was consistent with previous observational studies but the difference was not statistically significant. The availability of probiotics and pasteurised donor human milk is associated with a reduction in mortality in very preterm infants.
