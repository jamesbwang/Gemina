 Settings-based approaches to health promotion, involving holistic and multidisciplinary methods, which integrate action across risk factors are important. Major advantage of focusing on these settings is the continuous and intensive contact with the participant. Despite the apparent advantages of addressing non-communicable diseases ( NCDs<ORGANIZATION> ) using targeted interventions for several developed country settings, a relative lack of evidence of effectiveness of such interventions in low/middle-income countries has led to poor allocation of resources towards these interventions. The focus is therefore on the settings rather than any one condition, and we therefore expect the findings to generalise to NCD<ORGANIZATION> prevention and control efforts. We intend to estimate the effectiveness of targeted interventions in low/middle-income countries. We will search PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Excerpta Medica Database<PERSON>, OVID<ORGANIZATION>, WHO Library<ORGANIZATION> and The Cochrane<ORGANIZATION> Library from the year 2000 to March 2018 without language restrictions. Study<PERSON> designs to be included will be randomised controlled trials. The primary outcome of effectiveness will be the percentage change in population having different behavioural risk factors. Subgroup<PERSON> analyses will be performed, and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. No ethical issues are foreseen. The Institute Ethics Committee<ORGANIZATION> of the Post Graduate Institute<ORGANIZATION> of Medical Education<ORGANIZATION> and Research<PERSON> approved the doctoral research protocol under which this review is being done. Dissemination will be done by submitting scientific articles to academic peer-reviewed journals. We will present the results at relevant conferences and meetings. Systematic review.
