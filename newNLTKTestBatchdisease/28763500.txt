 Tuberculosis<GPE> ( TB ) is a leading cause of childhood mortality. Isoniazid<PERSON> preventive therapy significantly reduces progression to TB disease. The World<ORGANIZATION> Health Organization recommends that high TB burden countries conduct child contact management ( CCM<ORGANIZATION> ) to identify exposed child contacts aged < 5 years for screening and appropriate treatment. An active, clinic-based CCM<ORGANIZATION> strategy incorporating transport/screening reimbursement, monitoring and evaluation tools, and health care worker education was implemented in western Kenya<PERSON>. Among 169 identified child contacts aged < 5 years, 146 ( 86 % ) underwent successful screening, of whom 43 ( 29 % ) were diagnosed with active TB. We describe our CCM<ORGANIZATION> strategy and its potential for enhancing screening and treatment efforts.
