 The Mediator<ORGANIZATION> complex subunit 13-like ( MED13L<ORGANIZATION> ) protein is part of the multi-protein mediator complex and plays an important role in gene transcription. Polymorphisms in the MED13L<ORGANIZATION> gene have been linked to congenital heart anomalies and intellectual disabilities. Despite recent evidence of indirect links of MED13L<ORGANIZATION> to cytokine release and inflammation, impact of genetic variations in MED13L<GPE> on immune cells remains unexplored. The B10.RIII and RIIIS/J mouse strains vary in susceptibility to induced experimental autoimmune disease models. From sequencing data of the two mouse strains, we identified six polymorphisms in the coding regions of Med13L<GPE>. Using congenic mice, we studied the effect of these polymorphisms on immune cell development and function along with susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis, an animal model for rheumatoid arthritis. Combining in vivo disease data, in vitro functional data, and computational analysis of the reported non-synonymous polymorphisms, we report that genetic polymorphisms in Med13L<GPE> do not affect the immune phenotype in these mice and are predicted to be non-disease associated.
