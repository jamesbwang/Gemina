 Treatment with the second and third generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs<ORGANIZATION> ) increases cardiovascular risk in chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. We investigated the vascular adverse effects of three generations of TKIs<ORGANIZATION> in a translational model for atherosclerosis, the APOE*3Leiden.CETP mouse. Mice were treated for sixteen weeks with imatinib ( 150 mg/kg BID<ORGANIZATION> ), nilotinib ( 10 and 30 mg/kg QD ) or ponatinib ( 3 and 10 mg/kg QD ), giving similar drug exposures as in CML-patients. Cardiovascular<PERSON> risk factors were analyzed longitudinally, and histopathological analysis of atherosclerosis and transcriptome analysis of the liver was performed. Imatinib<PERSON> and ponatinib decreased plasma cholesterol ( imatinib, -69 %,
