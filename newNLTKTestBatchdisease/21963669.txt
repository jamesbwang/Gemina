 Exogenous stressors resulting from air pollution can lead to depression and chronic disease. Chinese<GPE> levels of air pollution are among the highest in the world, and although associated adverse health effects are gradually emerging, research determining individual vulnerability is limited. This study estimated the association between air pollution and depressive symptoms and identified whether chronic disease influences an individual 's susceptibility to depressive symptoms relating to air pollution. Individual sample data from the China<GPE> Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study<ORGANIZATION> and a group of city-level variables in 2011 and 2013 were used with the random effects model and Tobit<GPE> model. Adjustments were made for demographic, socioeconomic status, health behavior, and city-level climate variables with respect to living areas. Analysis<PERSON> was also stratified using chronic disease characteristics. The total Center<ORGANIZATION> for Epidemiological Studies Depression<ORGANIZATION> scale evaluating depressive symptoms ranged between 7 and 28 [ average 11.623 ( SD<ORGANIZATION> = 4.664 ) ]. An 1 % increase in sulfur dioxide and total suspended particulate emission intensities was associated with depressive symptoms scores that were 1.266 ( SE<ORGANIZATION> = 0.107, P<PERSON> < 0.001, 95 % CI 1.057-1.475 ) and 1.318 ( SE<ORGANIZATION> = 0.082, P<PERSON> < 0.001, 95 % CI 1.157-1.480 ) higher, respectively. Compared to respondents without chronic disease, those with chronic diseases such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes or high blood sugar, cardiovascular diseases, cancer or malignant tumor, liver disease, chronic lung diseases, kidney disease, stomach or other digestive disease, arthritis or rheumatism, and asthma had scores that were higher for depressive symptoms. Results confirm that the adverse health effects of air pollution should be considered when developing air pollution policies. Findings also provide justification for mental health interventions targeting air pollution exposure, especially for people with chronic diseases.
