 To evaluate the natural history of diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) in diabetic patients and to assess long term risk for other chronic diseases associated with DR. Retrospective, community-based study. Diabetics who underwent their first fundoscopic examination during 2000-2002, and had at least one follow- up examination by the end of 2007 were included. The primary outcome was the development of DR ( proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR<ORGANIZATION> ), non PDR<ORGANIZATION> ( NPDR<ORGANIZATION> ) or macular edema. Patients were followed for another 9 years for documentation of new diagnosis of related diseases. 516 patients ' ( 1,032 eyes ) records were included and were followed first for an average of 4.15 Â± 1.27 years. During follow-up, 28 ( 2.7 % ) of the total 1,032 eyes examined were diagnosed with PDR<ORGANIZATION>. An additional 194 ( 18.8 % ) eyes were diagnosed with new NPDR<ORGANIZATION>. The cumulative incidence of NPDR<ORGANIZATION> was 310/1,032 ( 30.0 % ). All the patients who developed PDR<ORGANIZATION> had prior NDPR<ORGANIZATION>. By the end of the 9 years extended follow up, patients with NPDR<ORGANIZATION> had a greater risk for developing chronic renal failure HR = 1.71 ( 1.14-2.56 ), ischemic heart disease HR = 1.57 ( 1.17-2.09 ), and had an increased mortality rate HR = 1.26 ( 1.02-1.57 ) Conclusion: DR is associated with a higher rate of diabetes complications. Patients with DR should be followed more closely. Key points During a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, the cumulative incidence of diabetic retinopathy in a community cohort was 18.8 %. NDPR ( non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ) is a predictor of PDR<ORGANIZATION> ( proliferative diabetic retinopathy ). In a real life setting NPDR<ORGANIZATION> is a marker of a poorer prognosis. Patients with NDPR<ORGANIZATION> should be monitored more closely.
