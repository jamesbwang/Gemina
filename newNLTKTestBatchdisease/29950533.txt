 there are many researches about IGRA<ORGANIZATION> in extrapulmonary Tuberculosis ( TB ), but there only few data from developing countries. This was the first research about the utility of IGRA<ORGANIZATION> in extrapulmonary TB performed in Indonesia<GPE> as developing country with the 2nd most frequent of TB<ORGANIZATION> cases in the world. This study aimed to identify the advantage of IGRA<ORGANIZATION> examination in diagnosing extrapulmonary TB. eighty-four patients, presumed to have extrapulmonary TB were examined with IGRA<ORGANIZATION> and gold standard examination. The gold standard examination was performed by histopathologic examination, and tissue smear for acid-fast bacilli. among 84 patients included in the study, 57 patients were tested positive with gold standard, where 50 patients among them were also tested positive with IGRA<ORGANIZATION>. Among 27 patients tested negative with gold standard, IGRA<ORGANIZATION> positive was found in 10 patients. Lymphadenitis<PERSON> was the most common manifestation of the extrapulmonary TB. Diagnostic<PERSON> test from IGRA<ORGANIZATION> for extrapulmonary TB found as follows: sensitivity 87,71 %, specificity 63 %, positive predictive value 83,33 %, and negative predictive value 70,83 %. IGRA<ORGANIZATION> could be used as supporting tool in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB. The negative result, however, does not indicate absence of TB<ORGANIZATION> infection.
