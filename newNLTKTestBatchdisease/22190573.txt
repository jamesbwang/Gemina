 In the early phases of multiple sclerosis ( MS ), patients exhibit slight neuropsychiatric deficits that can only be detected using reliable tools. The present investigation aimed to examine neuropsychological performance in 35 patients with incipient MS. For the MS<ORGANIZATION> group, the inclusion criteria included time of disease < 3 years and low disability. The neuropsychological battery consisted of Rey Auditory<ORGANIZATION> Learning Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test<ORGANIZATION>, Hooper Visual Organization Test<PERSON>, and Symbol Digit Modalities Test<PERSON> ( SDMT<ORGANIZATION> ). After correction for the educational level, no significant effect of MS on performance was found for all the tests except for the number of errors of the SDMT<ORGANIZATION> ( NE-SDMT ). Higher levels of education were associated with better performances in all tests, except for the NE-SDMT. MS patients made more errors than the controls. The effect on the NE-SDMT may reflect difficulties in the ability to inhibit inadequate responses. Patients may exhibit impulsive control disorders in incipient MS, independent of their educational level.
