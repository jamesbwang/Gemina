 Determining neuropathic pain component ( NPC<ORGANIZATION> ) among patients with chronic low back pain-radicular pain ( CLBP-RP ) and the adjustment between scales of neuropathic pain. One hundred and one patients with CLBP-RP were included in the study. The severity of CLBP-RP was evaluated by visual analogue scale ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> ). The Douleur<ORGANIZATION> Neuropathique 4 Questions ( DN4<ORGANIZATION> ) and Leeds Assessment<PERSON> of Neuropathic Symptoms<ORGANIZATION> and Signs Scales<PERSON> ( LANSS<ORGANIZATION> ) were used to evaluate the NPC<ORGANIZATION>. The mean score of CLBP-RP assessed by VAS<ORGANIZATION> was 80 mm. NPC<ORGANIZATION> was detected a rate of 65.3 % by DN4<ORGANIZATION> and 40.6 % by LANSS<ORGANIZATION>. NPC<ORGANIZATION> was 75.4 % in females and 47.2 % in males according to DN4<ORGANIZATION>, and 52.3 % in females and 19.4 % in males according to LANSS<ORGANIZATION>. The female gender, occupation, and VAS<ORGANIZATION> scores were determined to be significant factors contributing to presence of NPC<ORGANIZATION> according to logistic regression analyses ( p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.05 ). A medium degree accordance was established between DN4<ORGANIZATION> and LANSS<ORGANIZATION> scales according to kappa coefficient ( Kappa<PERSON> = 0.532, p < 0.05 ). CLBP<ORGANIZATION> is among the diseases causing mixed type pain accompanied by nociceptive and neuropathic pain. NPC<ORGANIZATION> was detected in a considerable part of patients with radicular pain. Identifying the character of radicular pain is significant to develop proper management strategies.
