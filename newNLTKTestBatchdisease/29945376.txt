 Artemisinin<GPE> is a preferred medicine in the treatment of malaria. In this study, AaCMK<ORGANIZATION>, a key gene involved in the upstream pathway of artemisinin biosynthesis, was cloned and characterized from Artemisia<GPE> annua for the first time. The full-length cDNA of<ORGANIZATION> AaCMK<ORGANIZATION> was 1 462 bp and contained an ORF<ORGANIZATION> of 1 197 bp that encoded a 399-anomo-acid polypeptide. Tissue<PERSON> expression pattern analysis showed that AaCMK<ORGANIZATION> was expressed in leaves, flowers, roots and stems, but with higher expression level in glandular secretory trichomes. In addition, the expression of AaCMK<ORGANIZATION> was markedly increased after MeJA<ORGANIZATION> treatment. Subcellular localization showed that the protein encoded by AaCMK<ORGANIZATION> was localized in chloroplast. Overexpression of AaCMK<ORGANIZATION> in Arabidopsis<GPE> increased the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids. These results suggest that AaCMK<ORGANIZATION> plays an important role in the biosynthesis of terpenoids in A. annua and this research provids a candidate gene that could be used for engineering the artemisinin biosynthesis.
