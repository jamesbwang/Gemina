 The relation has not been reported consistently between the PON1 Q192R<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism and coronary heart disease ( CHD<ORGANIZATION> ). To clarify the discrepancy, we performed the present meta-analysis to evaluate the association between the PON1<ORGANIZATION> gene Q192R<PERSON> polymorphism and CHD<ORGANIZATION> risk in Chinese<GPE> population. We conducted a comprehensive search of the PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, EMBASE<ORGANIZATION>, and China<GPE> National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for all available case-control studies. Two reviewers independently selected studies. Data were analyzed by STATA<ORGANIZATION> software package v 12.0. Thirteen studies investigating the association between the PON1 Q192R<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism and risk of CHD<ORGANIZATION> were selected in this meta-analysis with 4353 cases and 4882 controls. The association between the PON1 Q192R<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism and CHD<ORGANIZATION> is statistically significant under the recessive genetic model ( R/R vs Q/R + Q/Q, odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.111, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.017-1.214 ). We observed no statistical association between PON1 Q192R<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism and risk of CHD<ORGANIZATION> under allele model ( R<ORGANIZATION> vs Q, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.087, 95 % CI = 0.976-1.209 ), homozygous model ( RR<ORGANIZATION> vs QQ, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.192, 95 % CI = 0.949-1.496 ), and dominant genetic model ( Q/R + R/R vs Q/Q, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.127, 95 % CI = 0.938-1.354 ). This meta-analysis suggests that the PON1 Q192R<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism has a weak association with CHD<ORGANIZATION> risk in Chinese<GPE>.
