 The nervous system and the immune system communicate extensively with each other in order to maintain homeostasis and to regulate the immune response. The peripheral nervous system ( PNS<ORGANIZATION> ) communicates specifically with the immune system according to local interactions, including the `` hardwiring '' of sympathetic/parasympathetic ( efferent ) and sensory nerves ( afferent ) to lymphoid tissue and organs. To reveal this type of bidirectional neuroimmune interaction at the microscopic level, we used immunofluorescent staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP<ORGANIZATION> ) coupled with confocal microscopy/3D reconstruction to reveal the distribution of non-myelinating Schwann cells ( NMSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) and their interactions with immune cells inside mouse spleen. Our results demonstrate i ) the presence of an extensive network of NMSC<ORGANIZATION> processes in all splenic compartments including the splenic nodules, periarteriolar lymphoid sheath ( PALS<ORGANIZATION> ), marginal zone, trabecula, and red pulp ; ii ) the close association of NMSC<ORGANIZATION> processes with blood vessels ( including central artries and their branches, marginal sinuses, penicillar arterioles and splenic sinuses ) ; iii ) the close `` synapse-like '' interaction/association of NMSC<ORGANIZATION> processes with various subsets of dendritic cells ( DCs<ORGANIZATION> ; e.g., CD4+CD11c+ DCs, B220+CD11c+ DCs, and F4/80+ CD11c+ DCs ), macrophages ( F4/80+ ), and lymphocytes ( B cells, CD4+ T helper cells ). Our novel findings concerning the distribution of NMSCs<ORGANIZATION> and NMSC-leukocytes interactions inside mouse spleen should improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which the PNS<ORGANIZATION> affects cellular- and humoral-mediated immune responses in a variety of health conditions and infectious/non-infectious diseases.
