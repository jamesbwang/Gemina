 Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS<ORGANIZATION> ) have identified common variants associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ). Whole-genome sequencing ( WGS<ORGANIZATION> ) offers comprehensive coverage of the entire genome compared with genotyping arrays or exome sequencing. We hypothesized that WGS<ORGANIZATION> in subjects with severe COPD<ORGANIZATION> and smoking controls with normal pulmonary function would allow us to identify novel genetic determinants of COPD<ORGANIZATION>. We sequenced 821 severe COPD<ORGANIZATION> cases and 973 controls from the COPDGene<ORGANIZATION> and Boston<PERSON> Early-Onset COPD studies, including both non-Hispanic white ( NHW<ORGANIZATION> ) and African Americans<ORGANIZATION> ( AA ). We performed single-variant and grouped-variant analyses, and additionally assessed the overlap of variants between sequencing and array-based imputation. Our most associated variant was in a known region near HHIP<GPE> ( combined p=1.6x10-9 ) ; additional variants approaching genome-wide significance included previously described regions in CHRNA5<GPE>, TNS1<ORGANIZATION>, and SERPINA6/SERPINA1. None of our associations were clearly driven by rare variants, and we found minimal evidence of replication of genes identified by previously reported smaller sequencing studies. With WGS<ORGANIZATION> we identified > 20 million new variants, not seen with imputation, including > 10,000 of potential importance in previously identified COPD<ORGANIZATION> GWAS regions. Whole-genome sequencing in severe COPD<ORGANIZATION> identifies a large number of potentially important functional variants, with the strongest associations being in known COPD<ORGANIZATION> risk loci, including HHIP<ORGANIZATION> and SERPINA1<ORGANIZATION> ( AA ). Larger sample sizes will be needed to identify associated variants in novel regions of the genome.
