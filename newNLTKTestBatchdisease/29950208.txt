 To investigate the effects of arsenic trioxide ( As The proliferation of HL-60 cells was detected by CCK-8 method at different concentrations of arsenic trioxide for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The cell morphological changes were observed by inverted microscopy. The expressions of Mad2<GPE> and Cdc20<GPE> mRNA and protein in HL-60 cells treated with As Arsenic trioxide significantly inhibited the HL-60 cell proliferation and displayed a good time-dose correlation. RT-PCR and Western<GPE> blot showed that the expression of Mad2<PERSON> was up-regulated and the expression of Cdc20<PERSON> was down-regulated in HL-60 cells treated with arsenic trioxide of different concentration ( 4,8,10 Âµmol/L ). Arsenic trioxide can inhibit the human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell proliferation, and its mechanism may be related with up-regulation of Mad2<GPE> expression and down-regulation of Cdc20<GPE> expression.
