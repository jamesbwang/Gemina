 We earlier found that F6<GPE> fraction of human filaria Brugia<PERSON> malayi cross-reacted with sera of Leishmania<GPE> donovani infected hamsters and immunization with F6<PERSON> inhibited both filarial and leishmanial infections. In the present study, we identified a 52.9-93.6 kDa<ORGANIZATION> fraction ( Ld1 ) of L. donovani that cross-reacted with sera of B. malayi infected animals and investigated effect of Ld1<GPE> on filarial infection. Immunization of BALB/c mice with Ld1<PERSON> facilitated B. malayi infection with remarkable increase in parasite burden. Facilitation of filarial infection was associated with downregulated cell proliferation, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 levels and upregulated IL-4 and TGF-β. Ld1 exposure also suppressed MHC<ORGANIZATION> class-I, MHC<ORGANIZATION> class-II, and FcεR1<ORGANIZATION> expression, and phagocytosis in naive mouse macrophages, and CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cell population in mouse spleen. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry revealed eight proteins in Ld1<GPE>: putative heat shock protein ( HSP<ORGANIZATION> ) 70-related protein 1, HSP70<ORGANIZATION> mitochondrial precursor, alanine aminotransferase, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, protein disulfide isomerase, putative ATPase<ORGANIZATION> beta subunit, trypanothione reductase, and a hypothetical protein. HSP70 protein mitochondrial precursor and trypanothione reductase showed homology with Trypanosoma<GPE> cruzi and L. donovani, respectively, and the rest 6 proteins including hypothetical protein bear homology with L. infantum. In conclusion, the present study for the first time shows that immunization with filarial cross-reactive Ld1 fraction of L. donovani facilitates filarial infection by modulating Th1<PERSON> and Th2<ORGANIZATION> responses. Ld1 molecules may therefore facilitate filarial infection in filaria-leishmania co-infection.
