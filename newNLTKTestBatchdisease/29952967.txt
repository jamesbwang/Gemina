 Lung<GPE> microbiota may affect innate immunity and treatment consequence in the obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. Bronchoalveolar<PERSON> lavage fluid ( BALF<ORGANIZATION> ) was obtained from 11 OSA<ORGANIZATION> patients and 8 patients with other lung diseases as control, and used for lung microbiota profiling by PCR<ORGANIZATION> amplification and sequencing of the microbial samples. It was demonstrated that phyla of Firmicutes<GPE>, Fusobacteria<GSP>, and Bacteriodetes were relatively abundant in the lung microbiota. Alpha-diversity comparison between OSA<ORGANIZATION> and control group revealed that Proteobacteria<GPE> and Fusobacteria<GSP> were significantly higher in OSA<ORGANIZATION> patients ( 0.3863 ± 0.0631 and 0.0682 ± 0.0159, respectively ) than that in control group ( 0.119 ± 0.074 and 0.0006 ± 0.0187, respectively, P<PERSON> < .05 for both phyla ). In contrast, Firmicutes<PERSON> was significantly less in OSA<ORGANIZATION> patients ( 0.1371 ± 0.0394 ) compared with that in the control group ( 0.384 ± 0.046, P<PERSON> < .05 ). Comparison<ORGANIZATION> within a group ( ß-diversity ) indicated that the top 5 phyla in the OSA<ORGANIZATION> lung were Proteobacteria<GPE>, Bacteroidetes<GPE>, Firmicutes<GPE>, Fusobacteria<GSP>, and Acidobacteria<GPE>, while the top 5 phyla in the control group were Firmicutes<PERSON>, Bacteroidetes<GPE>, Proteobacteria<GSP>, Actinobacteria<GSP>, and Acidobacteria<GSP>. These findings indicated that lung microbiota in OSA<ORGANIZATION> is distinct from that of non-OSA patients. Manipulation of the microbiota may be an alternative strategy to augment airway immunity and to reduce susceptibility to airway infection.
