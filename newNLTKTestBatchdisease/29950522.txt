 Constitutive NF-κB signaling represents a hallmark of chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases. The E3 ligase TNF<ORGANIZATION> receptor-associated factor 6 ( TRAF6<ORGANIZATION> ) acts as a key regulator bridging innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and antigen receptors to the canonical NF-κB pathway. Structural analysis and point mutations have unraveled the essential role of TRAF6<ORGANIZATION> binding to the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N ( Ubc13<PERSON> or UBE2N<ORGANIZATION> ) to generate Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains for inflammatory and immune signal propagation. Genetic mutations disrupting TRAF6-Ubc13 binding have been shown to reduce TRAF6<ORGANIZATION> activity and consequently, NF-κB activation. However, to date no small molecule modulator is available to inhibit the TRAF6-Ubc13 interaction and thereby counteract NF-κB signaling and associated diseases. Here, using a high-throughput small-molecule screening approach, we discovered an inhibitor of the TRAF6-Ubc13 interaction that reduces TRAF6-Ubc13 activity both in vitro and in cells. We found that this compound, C25-140, impedes NF-κB activation in various immune and inflammatory signaling pathways also in primary human and murine cells. Importantly, C25-140 ameliorated inflammation and improved disease outcomes of autoimmune psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis in preclinical in vivo mouse models. Hence<PERSON>, the first-in-class TRAF6-Ubc13 inhibitor C25-140 expands the toolbox for studying the impact of the ubiquitin system on immune signaling and underscores the importance of TRAF6 E3<ORGANIZATION> ligase activity in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. We propose that inhibition of TRAF6<ORGANIZATION> activity by small molecules represents a promising novel strategy for targeting autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases.
