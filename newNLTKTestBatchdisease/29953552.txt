 Nontyphoidal<PERSON> Salmonella<ORGANIZATION> infections contribute to approximately 1.2 million annual illnesses in the United States<GPE>. Historical and recent outbreaks have been associated with dairy products, ground beef, and direct contact with cattle. Salmonella<PERSON> antimicrobial resistance ( AMR<ORGANIZATION> ) is a serious concern that can reduce successful treatment of infections, increasing recovery time, medical costs, and mortality rates in humans and animals. This highlights the need to track AMR<ORGANIZATION> in Salmonella<GPE> isolated from cattle to improve treatment plans, manage trends in AMR<ORGANIZATION>, and prevent future AMR<ORGANIZATION> development. A total of 242 Salmonella isolates were retrieved from 9,162 cattle fecal samples submitted to the University<ORGANIZATION> of California<GPE>, Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital<PERSON> from 2002 to 2016. These isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a standardized broth dilution panel. Multidrug<PERSON> resistance ( MDR<ORGANIZATION> ) to three or more classes of antimicrobials was observed in 50.8 % of isolates, and the most common MDR<ORGANIZATION> pattern was amoxicillin-ampicillin-cefoxitin-ceftiofur-ceftriaxone-chloramphenicol-streptomycin-tetracycline ( 23.2 % ). There were significantly greater odds for antimicrobial resistance to aminoglycosides ( OR: 2.03, 95 % CI: 1.1-3.7 ), penicillins ( OR: 1.87, 95 % CI: 1.007-3.5 ), and tetracyclines ( OR: 1.87, 95 % CI: 1.017-3.4 ) for the 2002-2009 period when compared to the 2010-2016 period. The most prevalent MDR<ORGANIZATION> serotypes were Newport<GPE> ( 100 % MDR<ORGANIZATION>, n = 52 ), Typhimurium<GPE> ( 100 %, n = 20 ), and Dublin<GPE> ( 71 % MDR<ORGANIZATION>, n = 46 ). Risk factors associated with higher odds for isolating MDR Salmonella<ORGANIZATION> included isolates from calves when compared to adult cattle ( OR: 22.0 ; 95 % C.I.: 3.9-125.7 ), and isolates obtained from cattle suspect of having salmonellosis versus from the infectious disease control surveillance program ( OR:13.7 ; 95 % C.I.: 2.8-66.8 ). Despite a temporal trend for reduced AMR<ORGANIZATION> to most antimicrobial drug classes, a lack of this observed in the 2002-2009 period when compared to the 2010-2016 period for important drug classes such as cephalosporins ( OR: 1.6, 95 % CI: 0.87-3.1 ), and a trend for temporal increase in resistant to quinolones drugs ( P value 0.004 ) highlight the relevance of AMR<ORGANIZATION> surveillance in cattle with Salmonella<ORGANIZATION> infections with the aim of targeting future prophylactic interventions.
