 To develop an equation that accurately estimates fat-free mass ( FFM<ORGANIZATION> ) and the ratio of FFM<ORGANIZATION> to skeletal size or mass, using morphometric measurements in lean working farm dogs, and to examine the association between FFM<ORGANIZATION> derived from body condition score ( BCS<ORGANIZATION> ) and FFM<ORGANIZATION> measured using isotope dilution. Thirteen Huntaway<PERSON> and seven Heading working dogs from sheep and beef farms in the Waikato<ORGANIZATION> region of New Zealand<GPE> were recruited based on BCS<ORGANIZATION> ( BCS<ORGANIZATION> < 3, 3-4, > 4 ) using a nine-point scale. Bodyweight<PERSON>, BCS<ORGANIZATION>, and morphometric measurements ( head length and circumference, body length, thoracic girth, and fore and hind limb length ) were recorded for each dog, and body composition was measured using an isotopic dilution technique. A new variable using morphometric measurements, termed skeletal size, was created using principal component analysis. Models<PERSON> for predicting FFM<ORGANIZATION>, leanST<ORGANIZATION> ( FFM<ORGANIZATION> minus skeletal mass ) and ratios of FFM<ORGANIZATION> and leanST<ORGANIZATION> to skeletal size or mass were generated using multiple linear regression analysis. Mean FFM<PERSON> of the 20 dogs, measured by isotope dilution, was 22.1 ( SD 4.4 ) kg and the percentage FFM<ORGANIZATION> of bodyweight was 87.0 ( SD 5.0 ) %. Median BCS<PERSON> was 3.0 ( min 1, max 6 ). Bodyweight<PERSON>, breed, age and skeletal size or mass were associated with measured FFM<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.001 ). There was a good correlation between predicted FFM<ORGANIZATION> and measured FFM<ORGANIZATION> ( R<ORGANIZATION> As expected, the predictive equation was accurate in estimating FFM<ORGANIZATION> when tested on the same group of dogs used to develop the equation. The significance of breed, independent of skeletal size, in predicting FFM<ORGANIZATION> indicates that individual breed formulae may be required. Future studies that apply these equations on a greater population of working Huntaway<GPE> and Heading dogs are needed to establish the utility of these equations on a large scale. Such studies could ascertain if there is a ratio for lean mass to skeletal size below which the risk of injury or disease increases. If these equations prove useful they would provide an objective and non-invasive measure to determine when welfare in individual dogs is compromised by underfeeding.
