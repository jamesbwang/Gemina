 The etiology and underlying pathogenetic mechanisms in autism spectrum disorder ( ASD<ORGANIZATION> ) are still largely unknown. In this manuscript, a comprehensive review of the studies which are relevant to ASD<ORGANIZATION> and CAPD<ORGANIZATION> is conducted and the relationship of ASD<ORGANIZATION> and central auditory processing disorders ( CAPD<ORGANIZATION> ) is discussed in the light of recent studies on this subject that may provide new paths in the therapeutical perspective. Many studies confirm that most of the individuals with ASD<ORGANIZATION> have some degree of sensory dysfunction related to disorders of processing auditory, visual, vestibular and/or tactile stimuli. Among these, some recent studies addressed CAPD<ORGANIZATION>. There is an increasing amount of effort for researches about the link between ASD<ORGANIZATION> and CAPD<ORGANIZATION>. Most of the studies investigating CAPD<ORGANIZATION> in patients with ASD<ORGANIZATION> use electrophysiological measurements such as mismatch negativity or P300<GPE> event related potentials. Besides these, many publications reported deterioration in speech perception and expression in ASD<ORGANIZATION> patients which may also be related with CAPD<ORGANIZATION> in this unique group of individuals.
