 The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF<ORGANIZATION> ) in the treatment of HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection has been associated with renal dysfunction. In Nigeria<GPE>, data on the incidence and risk factors of TDF<ORGANIZATION> nephrotoxicity is sparse. We determined the cumulative incidence of and risk factors for TDF-induced renal impairment in HIV-infected individuals accessing care at the antiretroviral therapy ( ART<ORGANIZATION> ) clinic of Jos University<ORGANIZATION> Teaching Hospital<ORGANIZATION>, Nigeria<GPE>. This retrospective cohort analysis included patients aged ≥16 years that initiated ART<ORGANIZATION> between January 2008 and December 2011. Renal impairment, defined as glomerular filtration rate GFR<ORGANIZATION> < 60 mL/min/1.73 sqm using the Modification of Diet<GPE> in Renal<GPE> Disease ( MDRD<ORGANIZATION> ) equation was assessed at baseline and at 48 weeks on ART<ORGANIZATION>. Logistic<PERSON> regression was performed to determine factors associated with incident renal impairment. The mean age was 39±9 years, and 67.1 % were female. The cumulative incidence of renal impairment among the TDF-exposed and TDF-unexposed groups was 4.6 % and 2.3 % respectively ( p < 0.001 ). TDF<ORGANIZATION> exposure was significantly associated with renal impairment [ OR=2.0, 95 % CI= ( 1.48-2.89 ), p < 0.001 ] in bivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, older age ( aOR=1.06, 95 % CI= ( 1.05-1.08 ), p < 0.001 ), TDF<ORGANIZATION> exposure [ aOR=1.85, 95 % CI= ( 1.31-2.60 ), p < 0.001 ] and co-morbidities [ aOR=2.71, 95 % CI= ( 1.72-4.25 ), p < 0.001 ] were significantly associated with renal impairment. TDF<ORGANIZATION> exposure, aging and comorbidities were predictors of renal toxicity among HIV<ORGANIZATION> positive patients. Regular monitoring of renal function in such high-risk individuals is recommended.
