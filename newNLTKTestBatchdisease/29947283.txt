 Systemic<GPE> lupus erythematosus ( SLE<ORGANIZATION> ) is a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease that preferentially affects women of child-bearing age. Most current treatments for SLE<ORGANIZATION> with the exception of belimumab are not target-specific. Non-targeted therapy such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and other immunosuppressive drugs results in unwanted adverse effects. Although progress in treatment, including supportive therapy, has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with SLE<ORGANIZATION>, better treatment drugs and protocols with fewer adverse effects and higher efficacy for the most severe form of SLE<ORGANIZATION> are needed. Advancements in genomics, immunology, and pathophysiology in the field of systemic autoimmunity have provided physicians with increasing knowledge, but the most appropriate treatment for each patient with SLE<ORGANIZATION> remains to be established. Therefore, the search for novel treatment targets in patients with SLE<ORGANIZATION> is ongoing. This review focuses on recent findings in the genetics of lupus and the abnormalities in cellular interactions, cytokine profiles, and intracellular signaling in patients with SLE<ORGANIZATION>. Novel<PERSON> molecular targets for lupus, mostly introduced through clinical trials, are then discussed based on these findings.
