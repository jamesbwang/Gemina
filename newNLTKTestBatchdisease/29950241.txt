 To evaluate the accuracy and precision of 2 kinds of anti-treponema pallidum ( anti-TP ) ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents in our laboratory for detecting the anti-TP in voluntary blood donors, so as to provide the data support for use of ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents after introduction of chemiluminescene immunoassay ( CLIA<ORGANIZATION> ). The route detection of anti-TP was performed by using 2 kinds of ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents, then 546 responsive positive samples detected by anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> were collected, and the infections status of samples confirmed by treponema pallidum particle agglutination ( TPPA<ORGANIZATION> ) test was identified. The confirmed results of responsive samples detected by 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents were compared, the accuracy of 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents was analyzed by drawing ROC<ORGANIZATION> and comparing area under curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ), and precision of 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents was compared by statistical analysis of quality control data from 7.1 2016 to 6.30 2017. There were no statistical difference in confirmed positive rate of responsive samples and weak positive samples between 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents. The responsive samples detected by 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents accounted for 85.53 % ( 467/546 ) of all responsive samples, the positive rate confirmed by TPPA<ORGANIZATION> test was 82.87 %. 44 responsive samples detected by anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagent A and 35 responsive samples detected by anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagent B were confirmed to be negative by TPPA<ORGANIZATION> test. Comparison<ORGANIZATION> of AUC<ORGANIZATION> showed that the accuracy of 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents was more high, the difference between 2 reagents was not statistically significant. The coefficient of variation ( CV ) of anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagent A and B<PERSON> was 14.98 % and 18.04 % respectively, which met the precision requirement of ELISA<ORGANIZATION> test. The accuracy and precision of 2 kinds of anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents used in our laboratory are similar, and using any one of anti-TP ELISA<ORGANIZATION> reagents all can satisfy the requirements of blood screening.
