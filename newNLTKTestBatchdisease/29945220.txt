 Rapidly evolving pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, accumulate genetic change at a similar timescale over which their epidemiological processes occur, such that it is possible to make inferences about their infectious spread using phylogenetic time-trees. For this purpose it is necessary to choose a phylodynamic model. However, the resulting inferences are contingent on whether the model adequately describes key features of the data. Model<PERSON> adequacy methods allow formal rejection of a model if it can not generate the main features of the data. We present TreeModelAdequacy<ORGANIZATION> ( TMA<ORGANIZATION> ), a package for the popular BEAST2<ORGANIZATION> software, that allows assessing the adequacy of phylodynamic models. We illustrate its utility by analysing phylogenetic trees from two viral outbreaks of Ebola<GPE> and H1N1<GPE> influenza. The main features of the Ebola<ORGANIZATION> data were adequately described by the coalescent exponential-growth model, whereas the H1N1<ORGANIZATION> influenza data was best described by the birth-death SIR<ORGANIZATION> model.
