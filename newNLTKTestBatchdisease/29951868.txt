 This is the first study that has found that rehabilitation services ( RS ) intervention, following the onset of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ), may significantly reduce the risk of osteoporosis in RA patients. Those patients who received more than five sessions of RS<ORGANIZATION> had the greatest benefit for the prevention of osteoporosis. People with rheumatoid arthritis have increased risk of developing osteoporosis ( OP ). It remains unclear whether use of rehabilitation services can reduce the risk of developing OP. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study to compare the effect of RS<ORGANIZATION> on the risk of OP in Taiwanese<GPE> individuals with RA<ORGANIZATION>. A national health insurance database was used to identify 2693 newly diagnosed RA patients, 20-70 years old, between 1998 and 2007. Among them, 808 received RS after the onset of RA<GPE> ( RS<ORGANIZATION> users ) and 1885 patients did not receive RS ( non-RS users ). All enrollees were followed until the end of 2012 to record incident cases of OP<ORGANIZATION>. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compute adjusted hazard ratios ( aHRs<ORGANIZATION> ) for the relationship of use of RS with OP<ORGANIZATION>. During the 15-year follow-up, 358 RS users and 1238 non-RS users developed OP<ORGANIZATION>, corresponding to incidence rates of 87.24 and 129.27 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Use of RS<ORGANIZATION> was significantly associated with a lower risk of OP<GPE> ( aHR<ORGANIZATION> 0.62 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.56-0.71 ). Those who received more than five sessions of RS<ORGANIZATION> had the greatest benefit ( aHR<ORGANIZATION> 0.47 ; 95 % CI = 0.38-0.56 ). The integration of RS<ORGANIZATION> into the clinical management of patients with RA<ORGANIZATION> may decrease their risk of developing OP.
