 This study aimed to explore the protective effects of a Chinese<GPE> herbal formula, Jinshui Huanxian<PERSON> formula ( JHF<ORGANIZATION> ), on experimental pulmonary fibrosis and its underlying mechanisms. After being treated with single dose of bleomycin ( 5 mg/kg ) intratracheally, rats were orally administered with JHF<ORGANIZATION> and pirfenidone from day 1 to 42, then sacrificed at 7, 14, 28, or 42 days post-bleomycin instillation. JHF<ORGANIZATION> ameliorated bleomycin-induced pathological changes, collagen deposition in the rat lung and recovered pulmonary function at different days post-bleomycin instillation. In lungs of JHF-treated rats, the levels of total superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione were higher, and myeloperoxidase and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde were lower than those in vehicle-treated rats, respectively. Additionally, JHF<ORGANIZATION> inhibited the expression of NADPH<ORGANIZATION> oxidase 4 ( NOX4<ORGANIZATION> ) and increased the Nuclear<ORGANIZATION> Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 ( Nrf2<ORGANIZATION> ) in lung tissues.
