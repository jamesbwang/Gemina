 Structural and functional abnormalities in the cerebral microvasculature have been observed in Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ) patients and animal models. One cause of hypoperfusion is the thickening of the cerebrovascular basement membrane ( CVBM<ORGANIZATION> ) due to increased collagen-IV deposition around capillaries. This study investigated whether these and other alterations in the cerebrovascular system associated with AD can be prevented by long-term dietary supplementation with the antioxidant ubiquinol ( Ub ) stabilized with Kaneka QH P30<PERSON> powder containing ascorbic acid ( ASC<ORGANIZATION> ) in a mouse model of advanced AD ( 3 × Tg-AD mice, 12 months old ). Animals were treated from prodromal stages of disease ( 3 months of age ) with standard chow without or with Ub<PERSON> + ASC or ASC-containing vehicle and compared to wild-type ( WT ) mice. The number of β-amyloid ( Aβ ) plaques in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex was higher in female than in male 3 × Tg-AD mice. Extensive regions of hypoxia were characterized by a higher plaque burden in females only. This was abolished by Ub<PERSON> + ASC and, to a lesser extent, by ASC<ORGANIZATION> treatment. Irrespective of Aβ<GPE> burden, increased collagen-IV deposition in the CVBM<ORGANIZATION> was observed in both male and female 3 × Tg-AD mice relative to WT animals ; this was also abrogated in Ub<GPE> + ASC- and ASC-treated mice. The chronic inflammation in the hippocampus and oxidative stress in peripheral leukocytes of 3 × Tg-AD mice were likewise reversed by antioxidant treatment. These results provide strong evidence that long-term antioxidant treatment can mitigate plasma oxidative stress, amyloid burden, and hypoxia in the AD<ORGANIZATION> brain parenchyma.
