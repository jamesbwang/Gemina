 Chlamydia<GPE> pecorum is a mucosal infection, which causes debilitating disease of the urinary tract, reproductive tract and ocular sites of koalas ( Phascolarctos<ORGANIZATION> cinereus ). While antibiotics are available for treatment, they are detrimental to the koalas ' gastrointestinal tract microflora leaving the implementation of a vaccine as an ideal option for the long-term management of koala populations. We have previously reported on the successes of an anti-chlamydial recombinant major outer membrane protein ( rMOMP<ORGANIZATION> ) vaccine however, recombinant protein based vaccines are not ideal candidates for scale up from the research level to small-medium production level for wider usage. Peptide<PERSON> based vaccines are a promising area for vaccine development, because peptides are stable, cost effective and easily produced. In this current study, we assessed, for the first time, the immune responses to a synthetic peptide based anti-chlamydial vaccine in koalas. Five healthy male koalas were vaccinated with two synthetic peptides derived from C. pecorum MOMP<ORGANIZATION> and another five healthy male koalas were vaccinated with full length recombinant C. pecorum MOMP<ORGANIZATION> ( genotype G ). Systemic ( IgG<ORGANIZATION> ) and mucosal ( IgA<ORGANIZATION> ) antibodies were quantified and pre-vaccination levels compared to post-vaccination levels ( 12 and 26 weeks ). MOMP-peptide vaccinated koalas produced Chlamydia-specific IgG and IgA<ORGANIZATION> antibodies, which were able to recognise not only the genotype used in the vaccination, but also MOMPs from several other koala C. pecorum genotypes. In addition, IgA<ORGANIZATION> antibodies induced at the ocular site not only recognised recombinant MOMP<ORGANIZATION> protein but also, whole native chlamydial elementary bodies. Interestingly, some MOMP-peptide vaccinated koalas showed a stronger and more sustained vaccine-induced mucosal IgA<ORGANIZATION> antibody response than observed in MOMP-protein vaccinated koalas. These results demonstrate that a synthetic MOMP<ORGANIZATION> peptide based vaccine is capable of inducing a Chlamydia-specific antibody response in koalas and is a promising candidate for future vaccine development.
