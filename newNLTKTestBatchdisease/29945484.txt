 The natural flavonoid quercetin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. We investigated the effect of quercetin on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced macrophage migration. Quercetin<PERSON> significantly attenuated LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS<ORGANIZATION> ) -derived nitric oxide ( NO<ORGANIZATION> ) production in RAW264.7 cells without affecting their viability. Additionally, quercetin altered the cell size and induced an elongated morphology and enlarged the vacuoles and concentrated nuclei. Quercetin<PERSON> significantly disrupted the F-actin cytoskeleton structure. Furthermore, quercetin strongly inhibited LPS-induced macrophage adhesion and migration in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, quercetin inhibited the LPS-induced expression of p-FAK, p-paxillin, FAK<ORGANIZATION>, and paxillin as well as the cytoskeletal adapter proteins vinculin and Tensin-2. Therefore, quercetin suppresses LPS-induced migration by inhibiting NO<ORGANIZATION> production, disrupting the F-actin cytoskeleton, and suppressing the FAK-paxillin pathway. Quercetin<PERSON> may thus have potential as a therapeutic agent for chronic inflammatory diseases.
