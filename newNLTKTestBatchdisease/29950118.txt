 In literature, the importance of X-linked gene dosage as a contributing factor for autoimmune diseases is generally assumed. However, little information is available on the frequency of humoral endocrine organ-specific autoimmunity in X-chromosome aneuploidies. In our preliminary study, we investigated the endocrine organ-specific humoral autoimmunity relative to four different organ-specific autoimmune diseases in a group of adult 47, XXY<ORGANIZATION> KS patients and in adults 46, XY<ORGANIZATION> control males ( type 1 diabetes, T1DM<ORGANIZATION> ; Addison<PERSON> 's disease, AD<GPE> ; Hashimoto<GPE> thyroiditis, HT<GPE> ; autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis, AG ). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the frequency of autoantibodies ( Abs ) specific for T1DM<ORGANIZATION>, AD<ORGANIZATION>, HT<ORGANIZATION>, and AG in rarer higher grade X-chromosome aneuploidies ( HGA<ORGANIZATION> ) and in 47, XXY<ORGANIZATION> children. Samples from 192 Caucasian<GPE> patients with an X-chromosome aneuploidy ( 176 patients ( 55 children, 121 adults ) with 47, XXY<ORGANIZATION> karyotype ( KS<ORGANIZATION> patients ) and 16 HGA patients ( eight children, eight adults ) ) recruited from Sapienza<GPE>, University<ORGANIZATION> of Rome<GPE> ( 2007-2017 ) were tested for Abs<ORGANIZATION> specific for T1DM<ORGANIZATION> ( insulin-Abs, GAD-Abs, IA-2-Abs, Znt8-Abs ), HT<GPE> ( TPO-Abs ), AD<GPE> ( 21-OH-Abs ), and AG<ORGANIZATION> ( APC-Abs ). The results were compared to those found in 213 46, XY<ORGANIZATION> control subjects ( 96 children, 117 adults ). Altogether humoral organ-specific immunoreactivity was found in 13 % of KS<ORGANIZATION> and HGA<ORGANIZATION> patients, with a significantly higher frequency than in the controls ( p=.008 ). Almost 19 % of HGA<ORGANIZATION> patients were positive for at least one of the organ-specific Abs<PERSON> investigated compared to 12.5 % of KS<ORGANIZATION> patients. The frequency of the overall immunoreactivity was higher in KS children than in KS adults. The frequency of diabetes-specific Abs<PERSON> was significantly higher in the patient cohort than in controls ( p=.005 ). Thyroid- and gastric-specific autoimmunity was also found in KS and HGA<ORGANIZATION> patients, while adrenal-specific immunoreactivity was rare. These results suggest for the first time that the risk of endocrine organ-specific humoral autoimmunity progressively increases with the severity of X-chromosome polisomy. The screening for diabetes-, thyroid-, and gastric-specific autoimmunity should be considered in clinical practice for identifying rare and classic X-chromosome aneuploid patients at risk of developing organ-specific autoimmune diseases.
