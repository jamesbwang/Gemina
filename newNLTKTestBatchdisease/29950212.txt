 To analyze the relationship between the early treatment response and the pregnosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ). Two hundred and Seventy-eight ALL children diagnosed and treated in Hainan<GPE> general hospital from March 2013 to March 2017 were collected. All ALL children received therapy with CCLg-ALL-2008 regimen. The 3 year event-free survival ( EFS<ORGANIZATION> ) rate of ALL<ORGANIZATION> children in different groups was analyzed in terms of 4 indexes including sensitivity response to prednison at day 8 ( D8-SRP ), bone marrow remission at day 15 ( D15-BMR ) and at day 33 ( D33-BMR ), and minimal residual disease at day 33 ( D33-BMR ), and minimal residual disease at day 33 ( D33-MRD ). These 4 indexes and other indexes possibly affecting the prognosis of ALL<ORGANIZATION> children were enrolled in Cox<GPE> regression model for analysis of independent factors affecting the prognosis of ALL<ORGANIZATION> children. The D8-SRP test showed that among 269 ALL children, 240 ( 89.22 % ) cases displayed prednisone poor response ( PPR<ORGANIZATION> ) ; the 3-year EFS<ORGANIZATION> rate in predrisone good response ( PGR<ORGANIZATION> ) group was significantly higher than that in PPR<ORGANIZATION> group ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). The D15-BMR detection showed that among 262 ALL children, the bone marrow remission ( BMR<ORGANIZATION> ) as M1<PERSON> was observed in 230 cases ( 87.79 % ), M2 in 20 cases ( 7.63 % ) and M3 in 9 cases ( 4.58 % ) ; the 3-year EFS<ORGANIZATION> rate showed as follows: M1 group > M2 group > M3 group ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). The D33-BMR detection showed that among 257 ALL children, the BMR<ORGANIZATION> as M1<PERSON> was observed in 227 cases ( 88.33 % ), M2 in 21 cses ( 8.17 % ) and M3 in 9 caes ( 3.51 % ) ; the 3-year EFS<ORGANIZATION> rate in 3 groups showed as follows: M1 group > M2 group > M3 group ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). The D33-MRD detection showed that among 185 ALL children, MRD<ORGANIZATION> < 10 The early treatment response can predict the prognosis of ALL<ORGANIZATION> children, which is an independent prognostic factor for ALL<ORGANIZATION> children.
