 The purpose of this study was to describe the variability and test-retest reliability of a commercially available subjective visual vertical ( SVV<ORGANIZATION> ) system known as Virtual SVV<PERSON> ( Interacoustics<ORGANIZATION> ). In addition, the study aimed to compare the reliability of the Virtual<ORGANIZATION> system with a previously established bucket test of SVV<ORGANIZATION>. Fifteen participants with normal hearing, normal middle ear function, and normal utricular function were included in the study. Each participant underwent static SVV testing using both the Virtual<ORGANIZATION> system and the bucket test. Subjects<PERSON> completed 2 testing sessions to determine test-retest reliability. For each test, data were collected with the head at 0°, tilted 45° to the right, and tilted 45° to the left. This study was conducted in a balance function laboratory embedded in a large, tertiary care otology clinic. The mean SVV<ORGANIZATION> values obtained with the Virtual<ORGANIZATION> system were within 1°-2° from 0 with the head positioned at 0°, which is in agreement with many other studies of SVV<ORGANIZATION> with the head at 0° ( Akin<ORGANIZATION> & Murnane<PERSON>, 2009 ; Halmagyi & Curthoys<PERSON>, 1999 ; Zwergal<GPE>, Rettinger<PERSON>, Frenzel<GPE>, Dieterich<PERSON>, & Strupp<PERSON>, 2009 ). Using the intraclass correlation coefficient, test-retest reliability of the Virtual<ORGANIZATION> system was excellent in the 45° left position and fair to good in the 45° right and 0° position. Test-retest reliability of the bucket test was poor in all head positions. The Virtual<ORGANIZATION> system is a more reliable measure of static SVV than the bucket test. Therefore, the Virtual<ORGANIZATION> system could be utilized as a screening device for utricular dysfunction in busy clinical settings.
