 Ventricular<GPE> tachycardia ( VT ) is a leading cause of cardiovascular death and remains the main cause of sudden cardiac death. Implanted cardiac defibrillators ( ICD<ORGANIZATION> ) improve survival but the recurrent ICD<ORGANIZATION> therapies, mostly ICD<ORGANIZATION> shocks, are associated with an increased mortality and deleterious psychological effects. In this regard and based on the results of multicenter studies, the current European<GPE> guidelines recommend early referral for catheter ablation. The ablation strategy ( isolated endocardial approach or combined epi-/endocardial ) depends mostly on the underlying myocardial disease. Thus, almost all patients with right ventricular dysplasia and Chagas<PERSON> disease, the majority of those with dilative cardiomyopathy, and some patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy ( mostly posterior wall infarction or large transmural anterior wall infarction ) have an epicardial scar as the underlying substrate for recurrent VT episodes. Thus, in this group of patients, isolated endocardial VT ablation may be associated with an increased VT recurrence and therefore an epicardial approach is also needed. Cardiac<PERSON> imaging ( cardio-CT/MRI with late enhancement [ MRI LE ] ) can reliably identify the distribution and characteristics of the myocardial scar and may be helpful in planning the ablation strategy. When performed in highly specialized centers, epicardial catheter ablation of VT<ORGANIZATION> leads to a significant reduction of recurrent VT episodes compared to the endocardial VT ablation alone and with lower complication rates.
