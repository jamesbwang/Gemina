 The efficacy of tocilizumab ( TCZ<ORGANIZATION> ), a monoclonal antibody to the interleukin ( IL ) -6 receptor, in suppressing disease activity in glucocorticoid-naïve patients with new-onset polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR<ORGANIZATION> ) was studied. Its effect on a panel of cytokines and growth factors was evaluated. Three patients, fulfilling the PMR<ORGANIZATION> ACR/EULAR criteria, received TCZ<ORGANIZATION> at the dosage of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks for three times followed by prednisone 0.2 mg/kg in case of inefficacy. Concentrations of IL-10, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor ( TNF<ORGANIZATION> ) -α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17, interferon ( IFN<ORGANIZATION> ) -γ, vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF<ORGANIZATION> ), platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF<ORGANIZATION> ), and leukaemia inhibitory factor ( LIF<ORGANIZATION> ) were measured at baseline, after 72 h of the first TCZ<ORGANIZATION> infusion and then at weeks 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 22. A slight clinical improvement was seen only after the first TCZ<ORGANIZATION> infusion, but was largely inferior to that of conventional doses of GC<ORGANIZATION> administered subsequently. An ischaemic visual accident suggestive of GCA<ORGANIZATION> occurred in one patient during TCZ<ORGANIZATION> treatment. IL-6 was increased at baseline compared to controls, further increased after the first TCZ<ORGANIZATION> infusion, and was suppressed by GC<ORGANIZATION>. IL-17 production decreased during TCZ<ORGANIZATION> treatment and reverted to pre-treatment levels after GC. VEGF<ORGANIZATION> e PDGF<ORGANIZATION> showed a less constant pattern, but an increase of VEGF<ORGANIZATION> concentration antedated visual symptoms. The other cytokines were not detectable in patients and controls. In our small sample, TCZ<ORGANIZATION> was not able to suppress inflammation at the same degree as GC<ORGANIZATION>. As a result, monotherapy with TCZ<ORGANIZATION> in PMR<ORGANIZATION> can not be recommended, although its efficacy as adjunctive treatment in GC-resistant patients should be further evaluated.
