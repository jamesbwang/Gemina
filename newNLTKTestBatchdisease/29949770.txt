 Fear<GPE> extinction is a component of cognitive flexibility that is relevant for important psychiatric diseases, but its molecular mechanism is still largely elusive. We established mice lacking the kinesin-4 motor KIF21B<ORGANIZATION> as a model for fear extinction defects. Postsynaptic NMDAR-dependent long-term depression ( LTD<ORGANIZATION> ) is specifically impaired in knockouts. NMDAR-mediated LTD-causing stimuli induce dynamic association of KIF21B<ORGANIZATION> with the Rac1GEF<ORGANIZATION> subunit engulfment and cell motility protein 1 ( ELMO1<ORGANIZATION> ), leading to ELMO1<ORGANIZATION> translocation out of dendritic spines and its sequestration in endosomes. This process may essentially terminate transient activation of Rac1<GPE>, shrink spines, facilitate AMPAR<ORGANIZATION> endocytosis, and reduce postsynaptic strength, thereby forming a mechanistic link to LTD<ORGANIZATION> expression. Antagonizing ELMO1/Dock Rac1GEF activity by the administration of 4- [ 3'- ( 2â€³-chlorophenyl ) -2'-propen-1'-ylidene ] -1-phenyl-3,5-pyrazolidinedione ( CPYPP<ORGANIZATION> ) significantly reverses the knockout phenotype. Therefore, we propose that KIF21B-mediated Rac1 inactivation is a key molecular event in NMDAR-dependent LTD<ORGANIZATION> expression underlying cognitive flexibility in fear extinction.
