 The prognostic value of the acute phase protein Pentraxin 3 ( PTX-3 ) is not well evaluated in patients with septic shock, which reveal an unacceptably high short- and long-term mortality. New Sepsis-3 definitions are not yet implemented in most biomarker studies. Therefore, this study assesses the prognostic value of PTX-3 for short- and mid-term mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the latest definitions, treated at a medical intensive care unit ( ICU<ORGANIZATION> ). The study includes 213 ICU patients with clinical criteria of sepsis and septic shock. Plasma levels of PTX-3, procalcitonin ( PCT<ORGANIZATION> ) and interleukin-6 were measured on day 1, 3, and 8. All-cause mortality was followed up to 30 days and at 6 months. On all three days, PTX-3 levels were able to discriminate non-survivors from survivors at 30 days and 6 months ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> range: 0.59 - 0.70 ; 95 % CI: 0.52 - 0.79 ; p ≤ 0.02 ). Highest PTX-3 levels within the fourth quartiles during the first week of ICU<ORGANIZATION> treatment were associated with an increased mortality rate at 30 days ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 7 ; 95 % CI: 2.0 - 23.5 ; p ≤ 0.002 ) and at 6 months ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 5 ; 95 % CI: 2.1 - 11.4 ; p ≤ 0.006 ). Additionally, the prognostic value of PTX-3 was proven for all patients as well as in subcohorts of patients with sepsis and septic shock, according to Sepsis-3 criteria, both in univariate and multivariate analyses for 30-day and 6-months all-cause mortality, especially predicting all-cause mortality in septic shock ( HRs<ORGANIZATION> range: 1.0 - 2.9 ; 95 % CI: 0.3 - 5.1 ; p ≤ 0.03 ). PTX-3 offers prognostic value for the prediction of short- and mid-term all-cause mortality in patients suffering from sepsis and septic shock according to the latest Sepsis-3 criteria.
