 The liver is mainly hematopoietic in the embryo, and converts into a major metabolic organ in the adult. Therefore, it is intensively remodeled after birth to adapt and perform adult functions. Long non-coding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) are involved in organ development and cell differentiation, likely they have potential roles in regulating postnatal liver development. Herein<PERSON>, in order to understand the roles of lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> in postnatal liver maturation, we analyzed the lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> and mRNAs<ORGANIZATION> expression profiles in immature and mature livers from one-day-old and adult ( 40 weeks of age ) breeder roosters by Ribo-Zero RNA-Sequencing. Around 21,939 protein-coding genes and 2220 predicted lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> were expressed in livers of breeder roosters. Compared to protein-coding genes, the identified chicken lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> shared fewer exons, shorter transcript length, and significantly lower expression levels. Notably, in comparison between the livers of newborn and adult breeder roosters, a total of 1570 mRNAs and 214 lncRNAs were differentially expressed with the criteria of log This study provides a catalog of mRNAs<ORGANIZATION> and lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> related to postnatal liver maturation of chicken, and will contribute to a fuller understanding of biological processes or signaling pathways involved in significant functional transition during postnatal liver development that differentially expressed genes and lncRNAs<ORGANIZATION> could take part in.
