 This study was designed to investigate the gut microbiota of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The inclusive and exclusive criteria for NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients and healthy subjects were formulated, and detailed clinical data were collected. The genomic DNA of<ORGANIZATION> stool samples were extracted for 16S rDNA sequencing, and the amplified V4-region was sequenced on the Illumina Miseq<ORGANIZATION> platform. Metastats<ORGANIZATION> analysis was performed to identify the differential taxa between the groups. Redundancy<PERSON> analysis was used to evaluate the association between gut microbial structure and clinical variables. Thirty NAFLD<PERSON> patients and 37 healthy controls were involved. The 16S rDNA sequencing showed that there was a dramatic variability of the fecal microbiota among all the individuals. Metastats<ORGANIZATION> analysis identified eight families and 12 genera with significant differences between the two groups. When some clinical parameters, such as waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR<ORGANIZATION> ) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ), were enrolled in Redundancy<GPE> analysis, the distribution of the two group of samples was obviously changed. The compositional shifts in fecal bacterial communities of NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients from the healthy controls were mainly at family or genus levels. According to our Redundancy analysis, insulin resistance and obesity might be closely related to both NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> phenotype and intestinal microecology.
