 To investigate the effect of Deltex-1 on proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( bMSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) into smooth muscle cells ( SMCs<ORGANIZATION> ). bMSCs of rat were isolated from bone marrow, cultured and identified. The effect of Deltex-1 on the proliferation of bMSCs<ORGANIZATION> infected with adenovirus vector pAd/Deltex-1 was detected by cell count kit-8 ( CCK-8 ). The expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ( SM-MHC ), that is one of the markers of SMCs<ORGANIZATION> in bMSCs<ORGANIZATION> without treatment, with Deltex-1 virus infection or empty virus infection and co-cultured with SMCs<ORGANIZATION>, were detected by immunofluorescence cytochemistry staining, RT-PCR and Western<GPE> blotting. The same detection of bMSCs<ORGANIZATION> and SMCs<ORGANIZATION> without treatment was used as normal control, respectively. bMSCs of rat were isolated from bone marrow, cultured and identified. Compared with the control, the results of CCK-8 showed that the growth of bMSCs<ORGANIZATION> infected by Deltex-1 virus was slower, and began to appear more significant especially at 48 ( p < 0.05, p < 0.01 ). The results of immunofluorescence cytochemistry, Real-time PCR and Western<GPE> blot showed that bMSCs<ORGANIZATION> with Deltex-1 virus infection and co-cultured with SMCs<ORGANIZATION> significantly expressed SM-MHC, and weakly expressed Notch-1. The proliferation of bMSCs<ORGANIZATION> with Deltex-1 over-expression could be inhibited and its differentiation into smooth muscle cells could be promoted.
