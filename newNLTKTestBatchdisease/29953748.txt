 Visual<GPE> analog scale patient global assessments ( PGA-VAS ) are widely used in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) practice and research. Low<PERSON> PGA-VAS scores are required for remission. Vulnerable patients may have difficulty completing the PGA-VAS. There is limited information about both patients ' perceptions of PGA-VAS and how patients score VAS<ORGANIZATION> model disease states. The objective of this study is to understand vulnerable patients ' perspectives regarding PGA-VAS and model disease states. We enrolled RA patients at Denver Health<ORGANIZATION> ( n=300 ). Subjects<PERSON> completed the disease activity score-28 ( DAS28-PGA-VAS ) and Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire<ORGANIZATION> ( MDHAQ-PGA-VAS ) and completed a questionnaire regarding these PGA-VAS. Subjects also scored remission, mild, moderate and severe model disease states by VAS<ORGANIZATION>. We performed analyses using summary statistics, linear, and logistic regression. Outcomes included: whether subjects found the PGA-VAS confusing, if subjects ' responses to the model disease states followed a natural progression ( remission < mild < moderate < severe ), and whether responses to the remission model would meet Boolean<PERSON> and simplified disease activity index ( SDAI<ORGANIZATION> ) -based remission criteria. Approximately 40 % of subjects found the PGA-VAS confusing ; lower health literacy ( HL ) and depressive symptoms were associated with finding them confusing. Less than 25 % of subjects ranked the model disease states with natural progression and the remission model at the threshold for remission ; higher HL and income were associated with accomplishing these objectives. Vulnerable patients perceive difficulty with PGA-VAS, and do not reliably rate model disease state VAS<ORGANIZATION>. These patients are potentially at risk for disease activity misclassification because of literacy and other barriers in completing VAS<ORGANIZATION>. This article is protected by copyright.
