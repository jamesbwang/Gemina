 Thoracostomy<GPE> is a common treatment option for patients with stage III<ORGANIZATION> pleural empyema who do not tolerate pulmonary decortication. However, thoracostomy is considered mutilating because it involves a thoracic stoma, the closure of which can take years or require further surgery. A new, minimally invasive technique that uses the vacuum-assisted closure has been proposed as an alternative to thoracostomy. This study aims to analyze the safety and effectiveness of mini-thoracostomy with vacuum-assisted closure in an initial sample of patients.
