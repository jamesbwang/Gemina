 Objective<GPE> This study aimed to explore cytokine serum levels and the ratio of type 1 T helper ( Th1 ) /Th2 cells in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD<ORGANIZATION> ). Methods A<PERSON> total 245 patients diagnosed with AECOPD<ORGANIZATION> and 193 patients who progressed to stable COPD<ORGANIZATION> after the initiation of treatment in hospital were selected, while a further 50 healthy individuals served as controls. All patients with COPD<ORGANIZATION> were diagnosed using Global Initiative<PERSON> for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease<PERSON> criteria. Serum concentrations of interleukin ( IL ) -2, interferon ( IFN<ORGANIZATION> ) -γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and immunoglobulin ( Ig ) E were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results AECOPD<ORGANIZATION> patients had higher levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and IgE<ORGANIZATION> than those with stable COPD<ORGANIZATION> or controls. Intriguingly, the ratios of Th1/Th2 and IL-17/IgE were lower in AECOPD<GPE> patients compared with the other two groups. These data suggest that AECOPD<ORGANIZATION> patients produce more IgE<ORGANIZATION> and have more differentiated Th2 cells than other groups. Conclusion Our findings suggest that an imbalance of circulating CD4<ORGANIZATION>
