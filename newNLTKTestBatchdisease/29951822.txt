 Alterations in proteins that function in DNA<ORGANIZATION> replication and repair have been implicated in the development of human diseases including cancer, premature ageing, skeletal disorders, mental retardation, microcephaly, and neurodegeneration. Drosophila<PERSON> has orthologues of most human replication and repair proteins and high conservation of the relevant cellular pathways, thus providing a versatile system in which to study how these pathways are corrupted leading to the diseased state. In this chapter I will briefly review the diseases associated with defects in replication and repair proteins and discuss how past and future studies on the Drosophila<ORGANIZATION> orthologues of such proteins can contribute to the dissection of the mechanisms involved in disease development.
