 Palivizumab<GPE> has been used to treat respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV<ORGANIZATION> ) -infected hematologic malignancy patients at our institution based on limited published data. We conducted this retrospective study to evaluate clinical outcomes and mortality rates of RSV-infected hematologic malignancy patients from 2007 to 2016. A total of 67 patients ( 19 received palivizumab and 47 received supportive care ) were identified. Palivizumab-treated patients had a significantly higher proportion of underlying ischemic heart disease, graft-versus-host-disease, hypogammaglobulinemia, and concomitant pulmonary infections. There were no significant differences in mortality rates or readmission rates between the two groups. The estimated odds ratio for death in patients receiving palivizumab after adjusting for propensity scores and covariates were 0.12 ( [ 0.01, 1.32 ], p = .08 ) and 0.09 ( [ 0.01, 1.03 ], p = .05 ) respectively. After adjustment for factors associated with severity of illness, there was no difference in mortality among patients treated with palivizumab.
