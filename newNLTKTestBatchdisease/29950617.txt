 Myotoxicity<GPE> is a significant factor contributing to the poor adherence and reduced effectiveness in the treatment of statins. Genetic variations and high drug plasma exposure are considered as critique causes for statin-induced myopathy ( SIM<ORGANIZATION> ). This study aims to explore the sequential influences of rosuvastatin ( RST<ORGANIZATION> ) pharmacokinetic and myopathy-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ) on the plasma exposure to RST<ORGANIZATION> and its metabolites: rosuvastatin lactone ( RSTL<ORGANIZATION> ) and N-desmethyl rosuvastatin ( DM-RST ), and further on RST-induced myopathy. A total of 758 Chinese<GPE> patients with coronary artery disease were enrolled and followed up SIM<ORGANIZATION> incidents for 2 years. The plasma concentrations of RST<ORGANIZATION> and its metabolites were determined through a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. Nine SNPs<PERSON> in six genes were genotyped by using the Sequenom<ORGANIZATION> MassArray iPlex platform. Results<PERSON> revealed that ABCG2<ORGANIZATION> rs2231142 variations were highly associated with the plasma concentrations of RST<ORGANIZATION>, RSTL<ORGANIZATION>, and DM-RST ( P
