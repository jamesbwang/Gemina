 Vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP<ORGANIZATION> ) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP<ORGANIZATION> ) are highly similar neuropeptides present in several tissues, endowed with immunoregulatory functions and other systemic effects. We previously reported that both neuropeptides reduce viral production in HIV-1-infected primary macrophages, with the participation of Î²-chemokines and IL-10, and now we describe molecular mechanisms engaged in this activity. Macrophages<PERSON> exposed to VIP<ORGANIZATION> or PACAP<ORGANIZATION> before HIV-1 infection showed resistance to viral replication, comparable to that observed when the cells were treated after infection. Also, multiple treatments with a suboptimal dose of VIP<ORGANIZATION> or PACAP<ORGANIZATION> after macrophage infection resulted in a decline of virus production similar to the inhibition promoted by a single exposure to the optimal inhibitory concentration. Cellular signaling pathways involving cAMP<ORGANIZATION> production and activation of protein kinases A and C were critical components of the VIP<ORGANIZATION> and PACAP<ORGANIZATION> anti-HIV-1 effects. Analysis of the transcription factors and the transcriptional/cell cycle regulators showed that VIP<ORGANIZATION> and PACAP<ORGANIZATION> induced cAMP<ORGANIZATION> response element-binding protein activation, inhibited NF-kB, and reduced Cyclin D1<PERSON> levels in HIV-1-infected cells. Remarkably, VIP<ORGANIZATION> and PACAP<ORGANIZATION> promoted G-to-A mutations in the HIV-1 provirus, matching those derived from the activity of the APOBEC<ORGANIZATION> family of viral restriction factors, and reduced viral infectivity. In conclusion, our findings strengthen the antiretroviral potential of VIP<ORGANIZATION> and PACAP<ORGANIZATION> and point to new therapeutic approaches to control the progression of HIV-1 infection.
