 To estimate the impact of viral hepatitis B status on outcomes of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. We searched Pubmed<PERSON> and Embase<ORGANIZATION> for original articles that evaluated the impact of hepatitis B virus infection on outcomes of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The present study was conducted to generate odd ratios ( ORs<ORGANIZATION> ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs<ORGANIZATION> ) for pre-identified prognostic factors, overall survival, and recurrence. From 438 studies, we identified eight articles that compared outcomes between hepatitis B virus-infected patients and the others. In terms of clinicopathological characteristics, patients in the hepatitis B virus group significantly demonstrated single nodular tumor ( OR 0.7 ; 95 % CI 0.5-0.9 ; p = 0.01 ), infrequent lymph node metastasis ( OR 0.5 ; 95 % CI 0.3-0.6 ; p < 0.01 ), and infrequent perineural infiltration ( OR 0.3 ; 95 % CI 0.2-0.8 ; p < 0.01 ). No significant between-group differences were found in tumor diameter, vascular invasion, and tumor differentiation. Previous or temporary infection ( seropositivity for hepatitis B core antibody ) revealed no significant impact on clinicopathological characteristics. For survival outcomes, meta-analysis demonstrated that hepatitis B virus group had significantly better overall survival, recurrence rate, and median survival ( p < 0.01 ). Our results suggest that hepatitis B virus infection is a powerful predictor of favorable survival outcomes for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and significantly affects clinicopathological characteristics. Viral hepatitis B status needs to be taken into account and then establish therapeutic approaches.
