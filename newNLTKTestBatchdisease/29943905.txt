 Treatment-related osteonecrosis ( ON ) is a serious complication of treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ). This study included 1,489 patients with ALL<ORGANIZATION>, aged 1-45 years, treated according to the Nordic Society<ORGANIZATION> of Paediatric Haematology<ORGANIZATION> and Oncology ALL2008<PERSON> protocol, using alternate-week dexamethasone during delayed intensification, with prospective registration of symptomatic ON. We aimed at comparing risk factors, timing, and clinical characteristics of ON in children and young adults. ON was diagnosed in 67 patients, yielding a 5-year cumulative incidence of 6.3 %, but 28 % in female adolescents. Median<GPE> age at ALL<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis was 12.1 years and 14.9 years for females and males, respectively. At ON<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis, 59 patients had bone pain ( 91 % ) and 30 ( 46 % ) had multiple-joint involvement. The median interval between ALL<ORGANIZATION> and ON diagnosis was significantly shorter in children aged 1.0-9.9 years ( 0.7 years [ range: 0.2-2.1 ] ) compared with adolescents ( 1.8 years [ range: 0.3-3.7, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ] ) and adults ( 2.1 years [ range: 0.4-5.3, P<PERSON> = 0.001 ] ). Female<PERSON> sex was a risk factor in adolescent patients ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 2.1, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ]: 1.1-4.2 ) but not in children aged 1.1-9.9 years ( HR<ORGANIZATION> = 2.4, 95 % CI: 0.9-6.2, P<PERSON> = 0.08 ) or adults aged 19-45 years ( HR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.1, 95 % CI: 0.3-4.0 ). Age above 10 years at ALL<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 3.7, P<PERSON> = 0.026 ) and multiple joints affected at ON<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 3.4, P<PERSON> = 0.027 ) were risk factors for developing severe ON. We provide a detailed phenotype of patients with ALL<ORGANIZATION> with symptomatic ON, including description of risk factors and timing of ON across age groups. This awareness is essential in exploring measures to prevent development of ON.
