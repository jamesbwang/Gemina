 Long<GPE> non-coding RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> ) MALAT1<ORGANIZATION> is an important regulatory molecule in many diseases, especially in ovarian cancer. We aimed at exploring the function of MALAT1<ORGANIZATION> in ovarian cancer and at clarifying its mechanisms. The expression level of MALAT1<ORGANIZATION> in ovarian cancer tissues, para-carcinoma tissues and ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed by Real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ). The cell proliferation rate was detected by CCK8<ORGANIZATION> assay in SKOV3<ORGANIZATION> and HO8910<ORGANIZATION> cells. Transwell<PERSON> was used to detect the invasion and migration activities in SKOV3<ORGANIZATION> and HO8910<ORGANIZATION> cells. The cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rate were measured by flow cytometry analysis. The expression level of Dvl2<GPE>, GSK-3β, β-catenin and cyclin D1 were detected by RT-PCR and Western<GPE> blot. The relative expression level of MALAT1<ORGANIZATION> was identified to be aberrantly up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. The high expression level of MALAT1<ORGANIZATION> was associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. The down-regulation of MALAT1<ORGANIZATION> inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and migration, arrested cell cycle progression in S<GPE> phase and induced cell apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines. Meanwhile, the down-regulation of MALAT1<ORGANIZATION> decreased the expression level of DVL2<ORGANIZATION>, β-catenin and cyclin D1 and increased the expression level of GSK-3β in SKOV3<ORGANIZATION> and HO8910<ORGANIZATION> cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of MALAT1<ORGANIZATION> down-regulation in cell invasion and migration was reversed by SKL2001<ORGANIZATION> activating Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway and enhanced by XAV939<ORGANIZATION> inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway. MALAT1<PERSON> was overexpressed in ovarian cancer and associated to the poor prognosis. The down-regulation of MALAT1<ORGANIZATION> inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and migration, arrested cell cycle progression in S<GPE> phase and induced cell apoptosis by restraining the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ovarian cancer cells.
