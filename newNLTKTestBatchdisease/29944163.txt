 Cardiovascular disease ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the leading causes of mortality in hemodialysis ( HD<ORGANIZATION> ) subjects. In addition to the traditional risk factors that are common in these individuals, genetic factors are also involved, with emphasis on single nucleotide polymorphs ( SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ). In this context, the present study aims to systematically review the studies that investigated the polymorphisms associated with cardiovascular risk in this population. In general, the SNPs<ORGANIZATION> present in HD individuals are those of genes related to inflammation, oxidative stress and vascular calcification, also able of interfering in the cardiovascular risk of this population. In addition, polymorphisms in genes related to recognized risk factors for CVD<ORGANIZATION>, such as dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, also influence cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
