 As the population of patients with a Fontan<GPE> palliation grows so does, the number of patients with cardiac failure necessitating orthotopic heart transplant ( OHT<ORGANIZATION> ) and combined heart-liver transplant ( CHLT<ORGANIZATION> ). There is recent evidence that current era cardiac transplant in Fontan<GPE> patients have improved outcomes, but most studies have a preponderance of pediatrics patients in their cohorts. We examine our institutional experience with adult OHT<ORGANIZATION> and CHLT<ORGANIZATION> transplantation for failed Fontan<GPE> physiology. Retrospective analysis of patients at the Ahmanson/UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Disease<ORGANIZATION> Center who underwent OHT<ORGANIZATION> or CHLT<ORGANIZATION> for failing Fontan<GPE> physiology from January 1, 2002 to May 31, 2017. We identified 20 patients with single ventricle physiology and Fontan<GPE> palliation who underwent OHT<ORGANIZATION> or CHLT<ORGANIZATION>. The median age was 29.5 years ( range 19-44 ). Five patients underwent CHLT<ORGANIZATION> because of biopsy-proven hepatic cirrhosis. The median length of hospital stay was 23 days ( range 8-76 ) post OHT<ORGANIZATION> and 51 ( range 26-77 ) days post CHLT<ORGANIZATION>. During a median follow-up of 56 months ( range 2-178 ) there was one mortality occurring at 34 months post OHT<ORGANIZATION> due to coronary vasculopathy. Most frequent early post-operative complications included bleeding and infection ( 55 % and 20 %, respectively ) and surgical re-intervention for bleeding complications ( n=8, 40 % ). One CHLT<ORGANIZATION> patient experienced clinically significant hepatic rejection requiring admission and steroid treatment. Despite inherent risks and complexities of OHT<ORGANIZATION> or CHLT<ORGANIZATION> in patients with a failed Fontan<GPE>, transplant is a reasonable therapy. Peri- and post-operative complications are common and may require surgical re-intervention. Continued observation of practices and unifying themes may help improve patient selection, pre- and post-operative treatment and ultimately outcomes. This article is protected by copyright.
