 Mycobacterium<GPE> tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) regions of difference ( RD ) encode proteins which are potentially useful as diagnostic reagents for tuberculosis ( TB ). In this study, 75 genes from M. tuberculosis RD1-RD16 were successfully cloned from which 68 proteins were expressed and purified. Three serum pools from patients with pulmonary TB ( PTB<ORGANIZATION> ), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis ( EPTB<ORGANIZATION> ) and healthy controls ( HC ) were used to preliminarily screen individual RD proteins.
