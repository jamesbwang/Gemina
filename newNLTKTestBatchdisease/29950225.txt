 To analyze the success rate and influencing factors for collecting peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC<ORGANIZATION> ) by combination of cyclophosphamide ( CTX<ORGANIZATION> ) or E-CHOP chemotherapy combined with granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in patients with multiple myeloma. The clinical data of 75 patients with multiple myeloma in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received CTX<ORGANIZATION> or E-CHOP chemotherapy combined with G-CSF mobilization to collect HSC<ORGANIZATION>, and the success rate ( CD34<ORGANIZATION> A total of 86 collections by mobilization were performed in 75 patients, with the average 3.22 ( 0.12-22.28 ) Ã—10 There are no significant effects of sex, disease type, ISS<ORGANIZATION> staging and mobilization methods on the success rate of HSC<ORGANIZATION> collection in patients with multiple myeloma, and the less course number of chemotherapy ( < 5 ) before collection show a higher success rate of HSC<ORGANIZATION> collection.
