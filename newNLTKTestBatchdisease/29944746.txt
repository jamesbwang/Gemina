 Although predominantly a disease of cattle, bovine viral diarrhoea virus ( BVDV<ORGANIZATION> ) is known to infect other ruminant and camelid species such as sheep and alpacas. The aims of this study were to determine if BVDV-naive alpacas would become acutely infected and seroconvert to the predominant Australian<GPE> strain of BVDV<ORGANIZATION> following co-mingling with a BVDV-1c persistently infected ( PI ) heifer and to determine what, if any, clinical signs, haematological responses and selected biochemical changes occur with acute BVDV-1c infections in alpacas. A PI heifer and four alpacas co-mingled for 2 weeks. Weekly blood samples were collected and twice weekly clinical examinations were performed on the alpacas. Serum<PERSON> analysis by antibody ELISA<ORGANIZATION> indicated that all four alpacas were positive for BVDV-specific antibodies between 35 and 54 days after mixing with the BVDV-1c PI heifer. Viral antigen was detected by antigen ELISA<ORGANIZATION> in two alpacas on days 21 and 35 after initial mixing. In general, all the physical clinical parameters measured were normal. Serum<PERSON> biochemical and haematological analyses in two of the alpacas revealed marginally low sodium, chloride and elevated potassium concentrations, a lymphocytosis, monocytosis and a neutrophilia at some point during the study period in either one or both of the alpacas. This study showed that infection in Australian<GPE> alpacas readily occurs when a BVDV-1c PI bovine co-mingles with naive alpacas and that acute infections are clinically mild and undetectable without serological testing.
