 Work-related respiratory disease is a significant risk in the farming community. We assessed respiratory symptoms using a validated work-related respiratory questionnaire in 126 dairy farmers ( 19-75 years ; 91.3 % male ). The prevalence of cough symptoms was 34.4 %. Thirty-seven farmers ( 29.4 % ) complained of upper airway symptoms while forty ( 31.7 % ) complained of eye problems. Cumulated symptoms scores did not indicate higher than normal rates of chronic lung disease. Only 10 farmers ( 7.9 % ) were taking medication for lung conditions. Only 7 ( 5.6 % ) were current smokers. The rate of respiratory symptoms did not relate to the herd size or the method of animal feeding used by the farmers. The incidence of respiratory symptoms remains high among Irish<GPE> dairy farmers. While the exact reason for this is unknown it may be related to continuing work- related dust exposure.
