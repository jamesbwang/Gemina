 Loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP<ORGANIZATION> ) is used to detect pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB<ORGANIZATION> ) ; however, the diagnostic accuracy of the LAMP<ORGANIZATION> assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis ( EPTB<ORGANIZATION> ) is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of LAMP<ORGANIZATION> in the detection of EPTB<ORGANIZATION>. We searched PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, EMBASE<ORGANIZATION>, the Cochrane Library<ORGANIZATION>, China<GPE> National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI<ORGANIZATION> ), and the Wanfang<ORGANIZATION> database for studies published before Sep 16, 2017. We reviewed studies and compared the performance of LAMP<ORGANIZATION> with that of a composite reference standard ( CRS<ORGANIZATION> ) and culture for clinically suspected EPTB<ORGANIZATION>. We used a bivariate random-effects model to perform meta-analyses and used meta-regression and subgroup analysis to analyze sources of heterogeneity. Fourteen articles including 24 independent studies ( 16 compared LAMP<ORGANIZATION> to CRS<ORGANIZATION>, 8 to culture ) of EPTB<ORGANIZATION> were identified. LAMP<ORGANIZATION> showed a pooled sensitivity of 77 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 68-85 ), specificity of 99 % ( 95 % CI 96-100 ), and area under SROC<ORGANIZATION> curves ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) of 0.96 ( 95 % CI 0.94-0.97 ) against CRS<ORGANIZATION>. It showed a pooled sensitivity of 93 % ( 95 % CI 88-96 ), specificity of 77 % ( 95 % CI 64-86 ), and AUC<ORGANIZATION> of 0.94 ( 95 % CI 0.92-0.96 ) against culture. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC<ORGANIZATION> of MPB64<ORGANIZATION> LAMP were 86 % ( 95 % CI 86-86 ), 100 % ( 95 % CI 100-100 ), and 0.97 ( 95 % CI 0.95-0.98 ), respectively, and those of IS6110<ORGANIZATION> LAMP were 75 % ( 95 % CI 64-84 ), 99 % ( 95 % CI 90-100 ), and 0.91 ( 95 % CI 0.88-0.93 ), respectively, compared with CRS<ORGANIZATION>. These results suggest good diagnostic efficacy of LAMP<ORGANIZATION> in the detection of EPTB<ORGANIZATION>. Additionally, the diagnostic efficacy of MPB64<ORGANIZATION> LAMP was superior to that of IS6110<ORGANIZATION> LAMP.
