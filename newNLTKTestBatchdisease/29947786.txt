 Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA<ORGANIZATION> ), but not sedentary behavior ( SB ), is related to cardiometabolic risk among non-Hispanic white youth. Examine<PERSON> associations of SB<ORGANIZATION> and MVPA<ORGANIZATION> with cardiometabolic risk factors among Hispanic/Latino youth. Cross-sectional analysis. Four U.S.<GPE> communities. Hispanic/Latino youth ( n=1,426 ) age 8-16 years. Multivariable linear regression models assessed associations of MVPA<ORGANIZATION> and SB<ORGANIZATION> measured using 7-day accelerometer ( independent variables ) with markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and endothelial function ( dependent variables ), while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and accelerometer wear time. Further models controlled for obesity measures. SB comprised mean ( SD ) 75 % ( 13 % ) of accelerometer wear time, and mean ( SD ) MVPA<ORGANIZATION> was 35 min/day ( 22 min/day ). Deleterious levels of HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were each associated with lower levels of MVPA<ORGANIZATION> and higher levels of SB<GPE> ( all P < 0.05 ). Associations of MVPA<ORGANIZATION> with log-transformed triglycerides ( β per 15-min/day increment, -0.039<GPE> ; SE, 0.018 ; P=0.037 ) and SB with HDL-cholesterol ( β per 30-min/day increment, -0.63<GPE> ; SE, 0.26 ; P=0.018 ), but not those with other markers, remained significant after adjusting for MVPA<ORGANIZATION> or SB<ORGANIZATION> and further adjustment for body mass index and waist circumference. Higher SB tertiles were associated with lower soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products in fully adjusted models ( P-for-trend=0.037 ). Physiological precursors of diabetes and cardiovascular disease were associated with MVPA<ORGANIZATION> and SB<ORGANIZATION> among U.S.<GPE> Hispanic/Latino youth, a group that bears a disproportionate burden of metabolic disorders.
