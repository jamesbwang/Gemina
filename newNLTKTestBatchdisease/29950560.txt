 Adult-type granulosa cell tumors of the ovary ( aGCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) are rare gynecologic malignancies that exhibit a high frequency of somatic FOXL2<ORGANIZATION> c.C402G ( p.Cys134Trp ) mutation. Treatment of relapsed aGCT<ORGANIZATION> remains a significant clinical challenge. Here we show, using whole-exome and cancer gene panel sequencing of 79 aGCTs from two independent cohorts, that truncating mutation of the histone lysine methyltransferase gene KMT2D<ORGANIZATION> ( also known as MLL2<ORGANIZATION> ) is a recurrent somatic event in aGCT<ORGANIZATION>. Mono-allelic KMT2D-truncating mutations are more frequent in recurrent ( 10/44, 23 % ) compared with primary ( 1/35, 3 % ) aGCTs ( p = 0.02, two-sided Fisher<PERSON> 's exact test ). IHC<ORGANIZATION> detects additional non-KMT2D-mutated aGCTs with loss of nuclear KMT2D<ORGANIZATION> expression, suggesting that non-genetic KMT2D<ORGANIZATION> inactivation may occur in this tumor type. These findings identify KMT2D<ORGANIZATION> inactivation as a novel driver event in aGCTs<ORGANIZATION> and suggest that mutation of this gene may increase the risk of disease recurrence.
