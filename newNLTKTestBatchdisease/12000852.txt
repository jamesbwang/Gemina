 The pathologic relationship linking obesity and lipid dismetabolism with earlier onset of aging-related disorders, including cardiovascular disease ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ) and type-2 diabetes ( T2D ), is not fully elucidate. Chronic<PERSON> inflammatory state, in obese individuals, may accelerate cellular aging. However, leukocyte telomere length ( LTL<ORGANIZATION> ), the cellular biological aging indicator, is elusively linked with obesity. Recent studies indicate that sterol 27-hydroxylase ( CYP27A1<ORGANIZATION> ) is an emerging antiatherogenic enzyme, that, by converting extrahepatic cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol, facilitates cholesterol removal Obese subjects from SPHERE<ORGANIZATION> project { Higher LTL<PERSON> attrition was found in severe-obese than overweight individuals ( Our study supports evidence that CYP27A1<ORGANIZATION> genetic characterization identifies persons at higher risk to develop CVD<ORGANIZATION> and T2D<PERSON>, on which better converge preventive measures, and opens new perspectives on mechanisms that link obesity with aging-related disorders.
