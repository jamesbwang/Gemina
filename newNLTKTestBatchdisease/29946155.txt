 The cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality in end-stage renal disease ( ESRD<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. However, roles of statins are still controversial in dialysis-dependent ESRD<ORGANIZATION> patients regardless of having proven coronary artery occlusive disease. The aim of this study was to examine the benefit of statin following percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI<ORGANIZATION> ) in ESRD<ORGANIZATION> patients who have proven coronary artery occlusive disease. This study was based on the National Health<ORGANIZATION> Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort<PERSON> in South Korea<GPE>. We included 150 ESRD<ORGANIZATION> patients on chronic hemodialysis who underwent PCI<ORGANIZATION> with stenting between 2002 and 2013. The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Multivariate time-dependent Cox regression analysis were performed, and statin therapy after PCI<ORGANIZATION> was treated as a time-dependent variable. During 3.15 ± 2.71 ( mean ± standard deviation ) years of follow-up, there were 82 patients with primary outcome. The adjusted hazard ratio for statin use was 0.54 [ 0.33-0.90 ] compared to no statin use. This study showed that statin has significant benefit on reducing adverse events risk in dialysis-dependent ESRD<ORGANIZATION> patients after PCI<ORGANIZATION>.
