 While overt thyroid disease is a well-known risk factor for infertility, the potential consequences of mild thyroid dysfunction or thyroid autoimmunity remain unknown. While experimental studies suggest a considerable role for thyroid hormone in the physiological mechanisms of ovarian reserve, translation of such findings to studies in humans remains sparse. A potential role for thyroid function in female reproduction is especially relevant when the cause of infertility remains unknown, such as in women with diminished ovarian reserve ( DOR<ORGANIZATION> ) or unexplained infertility. To study the association of thyroid function and autoimmunity with markers of ovarian reserve day 3 follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH<ORGANIZATION> ) concentrations and antral follicle count ( AFC<ORGANIZATION> ), and to investigate if thyroid function or autoimmunity may have different effects in women with DOR<ORGANIZATION> or unexplained infertility. We measured TSH<ORGANIZATION>, FT4<ORGANIZATION>, T4<GPE>, FT3<ORGANIZATION>, T3<GPE>, TPO-antibodies ( TPOAbs<ORGANIZATION> ) and thyroglobulinantibodies ( TgAbs<ORGANIZATION> ) as well as AFC<ORGANIZATION> and the day 3 FSH<ORGANIZATION> concentration among women seeking fertility treatment at the Massachusetts<ORGANIZATION> General Hospital Fertility Center<ORGANIZATION>. We used multiple linear or mixed regression models to study the association of thyroid function or autoimmunity with AFC<ORGANIZATION> or day 3 FSH. In the total study population ( 436 women, 530 AFC measurements ), there was no association of thyroid function or TPOAb<ORGANIZATION> positivity with AFC<ORGANIZATION>. However, TgAb<ORGANIZATION> positivity was associated with a higher AFC<ORGANIZATION> [ mean difference ( 95 % CI ): 3.4 ( 1.8 to 5.1 ), P<PERSON> < 0.001 ]. In women with DOR<ORGANIZATION> or unexplained infertility, lower FT3<ORGANIZATION> and TPOAb<ORGANIZATION> positivity, was associated with a lower AFC<ORGANIZATION> ( FT3<ORGANIZATION>: continuous non-linear association, P=0.009<GPE> ; TPOAb<ORGANIZATION> positivity: -2.3 follicles [ -3.8 to -0.5 ], P=0.01 ) while TgAb<ORGANIZATION> positivity was not associated with AFC<ORGANIZATION>. Neither thyroid function nor thyroid antibody positivity was associated with the day 3 FSH<ORGANIZATION> concentration. We found that lower FT3<ORGANIZATION> and TPOAb<ORGANIZATION> positivity is associated with a lower AFC in women with diminished ovarian reserve or unexplained infertility. Future studies are required to replicate these findings and further elucidate the role of TgAbs<ORGANIZATION> and underlying mechanisms through which thyroid function and autoimmunity is associated with ovarian reserve.
