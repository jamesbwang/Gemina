 Urea<GPE> cycle disorders ( UCDs<ORGANIZATION> ) are inherited metabolic diseases that lead to hyperammonemia. Neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients with UCDs<ORGANIZATION> depend on the maximum ammonia concentration ( MAC<ORGANIZATION> ) in the blood during onset. MAC<ORGANIZATION> ≥360 μM is a marker of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. We investigated the neurodevelopmental outcomes and MAC<ORGANIZATION> at onset for 177 patients with UCDs<ORGANIZATION> in Japan<GPE> ( median age, 8 years and 2 months ; range, 10 days-72 years ), including 57 patients with male ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTCD<ORGANIZATION> ), 59 patients with female OTCD<ORGANIZATION>, 23 patients with carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency ( CPSD<ORGANIZATION> ), 28 patients with arginosuccinate synthetase deficiency, 9 patients with arginosuccinate lyase deficiency ( ALD<ORGANIZATION> ), and 1 patient with arginase 1 deficiency. Neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients with CPSD<ORGANIZATION> and ALD<ORGANIZATION> were poor because most had neonatal onset with blood MAC<ORGANIZATION> ≥300 μM at onset. Although OTCD<ORGANIZATION>, particularly female late-onset OTCD<ORGANIZATION>, has good neurodevelopmental outcomes among those with UCDs<ORGANIZATION>, it is not necessarily a mild disease with good long-term outcomes. Patients with severe UCDs<ORGANIZATION> and MAC<ORGANIZATION> ≥300 μM at onset should undergo liver transplantation ( LT ). Moreover, this study suggested that if the onset of UCD<ORGANIZATION> began during the neonatal period, then even UCD<ORGANIZATION> patients with MAC<ORGANIZATION> < 300 μM at onset should undergo LT to protect the brain.
