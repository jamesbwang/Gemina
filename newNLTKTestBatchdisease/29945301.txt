 The Harmonizing Outcome Measures<ORGANIZATION> for Eczema<GPE> ( HOME<ORGANIZATION> ) recommended the Eczema Area<ORGANIZATION> and Severity Index<ORGANIZATION> ( EASI<ORGANIZATION> ) as the core outcome instrument for measuring the clinical signs of atopic dermatitis ( AD ). However, EASI<ORGANIZATION> may not have been used in previous clinical trials, and other scores, e.g. SCORAD ( SCORing Atopic Dermatitis<PERSON> ), the objective component of SCORAD<GPE> ( oSCORAD<ORGANIZATION> ) and the Investigator Global Assessment ( IGA<ORGANIZATION> ), remain widely used. It is useful to establish a method to convert these scores into EASI<ORGANIZATION> to compare the results from different studies effectively. Indeed, EASI<ORGANIZATION> and oSCORAD<ORGANIZATION> have been found to be strongly correlated ( r
