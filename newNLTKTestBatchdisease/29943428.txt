 Spontaneous late-onset Alzheimer 's disease ( LOAD<ORGANIZATION> ) accounts for more than 95 % of all human AD. As mice do not normally develop AD<ORGANIZATION> and as understanding on molecular processes leading to spontaneous LOAD<ORGANIZATION> has been insufficient to successfully model LOAD<ORGANIZATION> in mouse, no mouse model for LOAD<ORGANIZATION> has been available. Existing mouse AD models are all early-onset AD ( EOAD<ORGANIZATION> ) models that rely on forcible expression of AD-associated protein ( s ), which may not recapitulate prerequisites for spontaneous LOAD<ORGANIZATION>. This limitation in AD<GPE> modeling may contribute to the high failure rate of AD<ORGANIZATION> drugs in clinical trials. In this study, we hypothesized that genomic instability facilitates development of LOAD<ORGANIZATION> and tested two genomic instability mice models in the brain pathology at the old age. Shugoshin-1 ( Sgo1<ORGANIZATION> ) haploinsufficient ( âˆ“ ) mice, a model of chromosome instability ( CIN<ORGANIZATION> ) with chromosomal and centrosomal cohesinopathy, spontaneously exhibited a major feature of AD<ORGANIZATION> pathology ; amyloid beta accumulation that colocalized with phosphorylated Tau, beta-secretase 1 ( BACE<ORGANIZATION> ), and mitotic marker phospho-Histone H3 ( p-H3 ) in the brain. Another CIN model, spindle checkpoint-defective BubR1<ORGANIZATION>
