 XEN45® Gel stents ( Allergan<ORGANIZATION> inc. Dublin<PERSON>, Ireland<GPE> ) are in their infancy and clinical expertise with microsurgical glaucoma devices are increasing. The soft flexible nature of the XEN<ORGANIZATION> stent together with its malleability under the conjunctival tissue should negate any risk of exposure of the XEN45<ORGANIZATION> stent ( XEN<ORGANIZATION> ). However we report a case in which, sight threatening endophthalmitis was the presenting feature of this complication. We present a case of uncomplicated XEN<ORGANIZATION> implantation that developed endophthalmitis 4 months after surgery. She gave an 8 day history of diarrhoea prior to presentation. She was noted to have exposure of the XEN<ORGANIZATION> stent at the point of entry of the XEN<ORGANIZATION> into the subconjunctival space. The stent was removed, pars plana vitrectomy was carried out and intravitreal antibiotics administered. Achieving the low intraocular pressures bearing in mind her preservative allergy became a challenge as we struggled to manage her advanced glaucoma medically. A CyPass® Micro-Stent ( Alcon Inc.<ORGANIZATION>, Fort Worth<ORGANIZATION> TX USA ) was subsequently inserted to control the intraocular pressure. Episodes of XEN Stent<ORGANIZATION> exposure may not be so isolated. We postulate that poor handwashing transmitted the causative organism to the exposed stent which then resulted in endopthalmitis. We would like to highlight a few learning points from this case.
