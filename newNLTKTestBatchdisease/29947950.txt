 Tamsulosin<GPE> is one of the most potent drugs currently available to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. Cytochrome P450<PERSON> ( CYP<ORGANIZATION> ) 2D6 and CYP3A<ORGANIZATION> are the two major enzymes responsible for tamsulosin metabolism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of CYP2D6<ORGANIZATION> and CYP3A5<ORGANIZATION> genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic effects of tamsulosin in humans. Twenty-nine male subjects were enrolled and their CYP2D6<GPE> ( *2, *4, *5, *10, *14, *21, *41, and *xN ) and CYP3A5<GPE> ( *5 ) genotypes were screened. Tamsulosin<PERSON> was administered daily for 6 days to assess its steady-state pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic effects according to CYP2D6<ORGANIZATION> and CYP3A5<ORGANIZATION> genotypes. CYP2D6<ORGANIZATION> group 3 ( with genotype *10/*10 or *5/*10 ) exhibited higher plasma levels than CYP2D6<ORGANIZATION> group 1 ( with genotype *1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*2xN, or *2/*10xN ) or CYP2D6<ORGANIZATION> group 2 ( with genotype *1/*10, *1/*41, or *2/*5 ) ( trough concentrations for groups 1, 2, and 3: 1.3, 1.8, and 3.8 ng/mL, respectively [ P < 0.001 ] ; peak concentrations for groups 1, 2, 3: 8.3, 10.0, and 13.8 ng/mL, respectively [ P < 0.005 ] ). Similarly, CYP2D6<ORGANIZATION> genotypes influenced the hemodynamic effects of tamsulosin based on systolic and diastolic blood pressures. However, the CYP3A5*3 polymorphism did not affect tamsulosin plasma levels and its hemodynamic effects. The CYP2D6<ORGANIZATION> but not the CYP3A5<ORGANIZATION> genetic polymorphisms affected the pharmacokinetics and the hemodynamic effects of tamsulosin.
