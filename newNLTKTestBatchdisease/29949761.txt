 Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> ) encephalitis is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder mediated by autoantibodies against the GluN1<ORGANIZATION> subunit of the NMDAR<ORGANIZATION>. Patients<PERSON> ' antibodies cause cross-linking and internalization of NMDAR<ORGANIZATION>, but the synaptic events leading to depletion of NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> are poorly understood. Using super-resolution microscopy, we studied the effects of the autoantibodies on the nanoscale distribution of NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> in cultured neurons. Our findings show that, under control conditions, NMDARs<ORGANIZATION> form nanosized objects and patients ' antibodies increase the clustering of synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors inside the nano-objects. This clustering is subunit specific and predominantly affects GluN2B-NMDARs. Following internalization, the remaining surface NMDARs<ORGANIZATION> return to control clustering levels but are preferentially retained at the synapse. Monte Carlo<PERSON> simulations using a model in which antibodies induce NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> cross-linking and disruption of interactions with other proteins recapitulated these results. Finally, activation of EphB2<ORGANIZATION> receptor partially antagonized the antibody-mediated disorganization of the nanoscale surface distribution of NMDARs<ORGANIZATION>.
