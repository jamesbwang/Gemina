 A generic RT-PCR assay was developed for the universal detection of viruses of the genus Tobamovirus using a novel pair of degenerate primers designed based on conserved regions on replicase genes of 32 tobamoviruses. The assay detected nine tobamoviruses, including six Solanaceae-infecting subgroup tobamoviruses of Tobacco<GPE> mosaic virus ( TMV<ORGANIZATION> ), Tomato<PERSON> mosaic virus ( ToMV<ORGANIZATION> ), Tomato<PERSON> mottle mosaic virus ( ToMMV<ORGANIZATION> ), Tobacco<PERSON> mottle green mosaic virus ( TMGMV<ORGANIZATION> ), Pepper<PERSON> mild mottle virus ( PMMoV<ORGANIZATION> ), Paprika<PERSON> mild mottle virus ( PaMMV<ORGANIZATION> ), one Orchidaceae-infecting tobamovirus of Odontoglossum<GPE> ringspot virus ( ORSV<ORGANIZATION> ) and two Cucurbitaceae-infecting subgroup tobamoviruses of Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus ( CGMMV<ORGANIZATION> ) and Zucchini<ORGANIZATION> green mottle mosaic virus ( ZGMMV<ORGANIZATION> ), with high amplification efficiency, specificity and sensitivity. The assay was applied to detect tobamoviruses in pepper and tomato fields. Five tobamoviruses, PMMoV<ORGANIZATION>, TMV<ORGANIZATION>, ToMV<ORGANIZATION>, ToMMV<ORGANIZATION> and TMGMV<ORGANIZATION>, were detected from the pepper fields in single and mixed infections. Single infections of PMMoV<ORGANIZATION>, ToMV<ORGANIZATION> and ToMMV<ORGANIZATION> and mix-infection of ToMV<ORGANIZATION> + PMMoV were detected from the tomato fields. Among these viruses, PMMoV<ORGANIZATION> was first detected from tomato worldwide, while ToMMV<ORGANIZATION> was first detected from tomato plants in China<GPE>. This generic assay is simple, cost-effective and has great potential to detect more tobamoviruses in the field.
