 It is known that some groups of immigrants can have low health literacy and it may affect their health. Although the number of North<GPE> Korean<LOCATION> defectors in the Republic of Korea<ORGANIZATION> has increased, little is known about their health literacy and health behavior. Adult North Korean<PERSON> defectors ( n = 399 ) in this study were surveyed on health literacy, using the Korean Health Literacy Scale<ORGANIZATION>, and on the use of preventive services. Those with better health literacy scores were more likely to have vaccination than the lower scoring group ( adjusted OR = 2.44 ; 95 % CI, 1.19-5.00 ). However, undergoing medical check-up may not be associated with health literacy. In subgroup analysis, among defectors who lived alone ( P<PERSON> = 0.032 ) or who had longer time in other countries before entering ( P<PERSON> = 0.007 ), the vaccination coverage was associated with their health literacy scores. This study provides evidence for an association between health literacy and influenza vaccination coverage among North<GSP> Korean<GPE> defectors even though they may have fewer language barriers than other immigrants. Further<PERSON> research is needed to develop interventions for improving health literacy and their preventive health behavior.
