 Conventional direct microscopy with potassium hydroxide ( KOH<ORGANIZATION> ) and culture were found to lack the ability to establish a fast and specific diagnosis of dermatophytosis. A pan-dermatophyte nested-PCR assay was developed using a novel primer pair targeting the translation elongation factor 1-α ( Tef-1α ) sequences for direct detection and identification of most veterinary relevant dermatophytes in animal samples suspected to dermatophytosis. A total of 140 animal skin and hair samples were subjected to direct microscopy, culture, and ITS-RFLP/ITS-sequencing of culture isolates for the detection and identification of dermatophytosis agents. Nested-PCR sequencing was performed on all the extracted DNAs<ORGANIZATION> using a commercial kit after dissolving the specimens by mechanical beating. Nested-PCR was positive in 90 % of samples, followed by direct microscopy ( 85.7 % ) and culture ( 75 % ). The degree of agreement between nested-PCR and direct microscopy ( 94.4 % ) was higher than with culture ( 83.3 % ). In 105 culture positive cases, the measures of agreement for the identification of dermatophytosis agents were as follows: 100 % between nested-PCR sequencing and ITS-RFLP/ITS-sequencing and 63.8 % between nested-PCR sequencing and culture. The developed nested-PCR was faster as well as more sensitive and specific than conventional methods for detection and identification of dermatophytes in clinical samples, which was particularly suitable for epidemiological studies.
