 Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ( NSVT<ORGANIZATION> ) is sometimes observed in patients with neuromuscular diseases ( NMDs<ORGANIZATION> ). The aim of this study was to assess the role of NSVT<ORGANIZATION> in the survival prognosis of NMD<ORGANIZATION> patients. We retrospectively analyzed the patients with NMDs<ORGANIZATION> who had undergone Holter ECG<PERSON> recordings at a single center between February and August 2012. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in this study. The 5 year follow-up was assessed according to the cumulative event-free rate. Twenty-one patients died during the follow-up, seven of whom died by cardiac death. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve that compared the patients with NSVT<ORGANIZATION> and those without NSVT<ORGANIZATION> indicated the NSVT<ORGANIZATION> was not related to the rate of all causes of death or cardiac death in those patients with NMDs<ORGANIZATION>. The survival curve was not significantly changed after the adjustment by age and ejection fraction. No significant correlations between NSVT<ORGANIZATION> and the prognosis in patients with NMDs<ORGANIZATION> were found.
