 The right ventricle ( RV ) plays a key role in the maintenance of an adequate cardiac output whatever the demand, and thus contributes to the optimization of the ventilation/perfusion ratio. The RV<ORGANIZATION> has a thin wall and it buffers the physiological increases in systemic venous return without causing a deleterious rise in right atrial pressure ( RAP<ORGANIZATION> ). The RV<ORGANIZATION> is coupled to the pulmonary circulation which is a low pressure, low resistance, high compliance system. In the healthy subject at rest, the contribution of the RV<ORGANIZATION> to right heart systolic function is surpassed by the contribution of both left ventricular contraction and the respiratory pump. RV systolic function plays a contributory role during exercise and in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The RV<ORGANIZATION> compensates better for volume overload than for pressure overload and is more capable of sustaining chronic increases in load than acute ones. An impaired RV-pulmonary artery coupling leads to a major mismatch between RV function and arterial load ( `` afterload mismatch '' ) and is associated progressively with a low cardiac output and a high RAP<ORGANIZATION>. Right ventricular dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of both cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and may partly explain the deleterious haemodynamic consequences of mechanical ventilation.
