 To investigate the presence of leukemia stem cells ( LSC<ORGANIZATION> ) in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ) and find out the relative position of leukemia cells in the figures of flow cytometry, and to analyze the relationship between minimal residual diseases ( MRD<ORGANIZATION> ) and the level of LSC<ORGANIZATION>, so as to explore the correlation of LSC<ORGANIZATION> changes with the curative effect and the prognosis during chemical therapy. A total of 85 samples were collected from 50 AML ( except M3 ) patients, including 50 samples from the newly diagnosed patients, 7 samples of AML<ORGANIZATION> patients with non-remission and 28 samples of AML<ORGANIZATION> patients with complete remission. All samples were used for detection of LSC<ORGANIZATION> from immune phenotype of CD34 The LSC<ORGANIZATION> was identified in the CD34<ORGANIZATION> LSC exist in AML<ORGANIZATION> and the relative position are consistent with the leukemia cells in flow cytometry figures, the size characteristics and weak expression of CD45<ORGANIZATION> are also similar to leukemia cells. The proportion of LSC<ORGANIZATION> decreases after chemotherapy. Detecting and tracking the LSC<ORGANIZATION> changes in bone marrow and combination with detecting minimal resident disease ( MRD<ORGANIZATION> ) may contribute to evaluate the theraputic efficacy and prognosis of leukemia patients.
