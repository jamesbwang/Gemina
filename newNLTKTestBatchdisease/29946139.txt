 Mycobacterium<GPE> tuberculosis drug resistance poses a major threat to tuberculosis control. Current phenotypic tests for drug susceptibility are time-consuming, technically complex, and expensive. Whole genome sequencing is a promising alternative, though the impact of different drug resistance mutations on the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC<ORGANIZATION> ) remains to be investigated. We examined the genomes of 72 phenotypically drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 72 Romanian<GPE> patients for drug resistance mutations. MICs<ORGANIZATION> for first- and second-line drugs were determined using the MycoTB<ORGANIZATION> microdilution method. These MICs were compared to macrodilution critical concentration testing by the Mycobacterium Growth<ORGANIZATION> Indicator Tube ( MGIT<ORGANIZATION> ) platform and correlated to drug resistance mutations. Sixty-three ( 87.5 % ) isolates harboured drug resistance mutations ; 48 ( 66.7 % ) were genotypically multidrug-resistant. Different drug resistance mutations were associated with different MIC<ORGANIZATION> ranges ; katG S315T<PERSON> for isoniazid, and rpoB S450L<ORGANIZATION> for rifampicin were associated with high MICs<ORGANIZATION>. However, several mutations such as in rpoB<ORGANIZATION>, rrs and rpsL<ORGANIZATION>, or embB<ORGANIZATION> were associated with MIC<ORGANIZATION> ranges including the critical concentration for rifampicin, aminoglycosides or ethambutol, respectively. Different resistance mutations lead to distinct MICs<ORGANIZATION>, some of which may still be overcome by increased dosing. Whole genome sequencing can aid in the timely diagnosis of Mycobacterium<GPE> tuberculosis drug resistance and guide clinical decision-making.
