 A fundamental question in the biology of sex differences has eluded direct study in humans: How does sex-chromosome dosage ( SCD<ORGANIZATION> ) shape genome function ? To address this, we developed a systematic map of SCD<ORGANIZATION> effects on gene function by analyzing genome-wide expression data in humans with diverse sex-chromosome aneuploidies ( XO<ORGANIZATION>, XXX<ORGANIZATION>, XXY<ORGANIZATION>, XYY<ORGANIZATION>, and XXYY<ORGANIZATION> ). For sex chromosomes, we demonstrate a pattern of obligate dosage sensitivity among evolutionarily preserved X-Y homologs and update prevailing theoretical models for SCD<ORGANIZATION> compensation by detecting X-linked genes that increase expression with decreasing X- and/or Y-chromosome dosage. We further show that SCD-sensitive sex-chromosome genes regulate specific coexpression networks of SCD-sensitive autosomal genes with critical cellular functions and a demonstrable potential to mediate previously documented SCD<ORGANIZATION> effects on disease. These gene coexpression results converge with analysis of transcription factor binding site enrichment and measures of gene expression in murine knockout models to spotlight the dosage-sensitive X-linked transcription factor ZFX<ORGANIZATION> as a key mediator of SCD<ORGANIZATION> effects on wider genome expression. Our findings characterize the effects of SCD<ORGANIZATION> broadly across the genome, with potential implications for human phenotypic variation.
