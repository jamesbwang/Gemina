 Natural<GPE> killer ( NK ) cells are innate immune cells equipped with the ability to rapidly kill stressed cells that are neoplastic or virally infected. These cells are especially important in settings where these stressed cells downregulate MHC<ORGANIZATION> class I molecules and evade recognition by cytotoxic T cells. However, the activity of NK<ORGANIZATION> cells alone is often suboptimal to fully control tumor growth or to clear viral infections. Thus, the enhancement of NK<ORGANIZATION> cell function is necessary to fully harness their antitumor or antiviral potential. In this review, we discuss how NK cell function can be augmented by the modulation of signal transduction pathways, by the manipulation of inhibitory/activating receptors on NK cells, and by cytokine-induced activation. We also discuss how some of these strategies are currently impacting NK cells in the treatment of cancer and infections.
