 The incidence of molar pregnancy in the cesarean scar is exceedingly low, however, the disease may carry a high risk of uncontrolled hemorrhage or uterine rupture. So far managements of this disease were rarely reported in literature. We reported a 28-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a complaint of amenorrhea for 48 days and vaginal bleeding for 3 days. Transvaginal ultrasonography, serum hCG<ORGANIZATION> and pelvic MRI<ORGANIZATION> confirmed the cesarean scar pregnancy. The patient underwent bilateral uterine arterial embolization and suction evacuation. The postoperative histologic examination of the tissue revealed a partial hydatidiform mole. Molar pregnancy in the cesarean scar is tough to differentiate from normal cesarean scar pregnancy with serum hCG<ORGANIZATION>, sonogram or MRI<ORGANIZATION>. This case suggested us that it was necessary to perform a histological examination of postoperative specimen for cesarean scar pregnancy.
