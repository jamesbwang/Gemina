 Nephronophthisis<GPE> is an autosomal recessive tubulointerstitial nephropathy that is a leading genetic etiology of end stage renal disease in children and young adults. Approximately 60 % of patients with a known genetic etiology of nephronophthisis are due to homozygous deletion of the NPHP1<ORGANIZATION> gene. We identified a total of 45 renal biopsies from young patients with chronic kidney disease of undetermined etiology and analyzed them for the possibility of nephronophthisis due to NPHP1<ORGANIZATION> deletion using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or polymerase chain reaction. Homozygous NPHP1<PERSON> deletion was identified in nine patients ( 20 % ). In cases with adequate tissue, both assays were performed and showed 100 % agreement. Blinded histopathologic analysis was then performed and identified six lesions that were significantly more common in biopsies from patients with NPHP1<ORGANIZATION> deletion-proven nephronophthisis than chronic kidney injury of other known etiologies. Many of the classically described nephronophthisis biopsy lesions such as tubular basement membrane duplication, presence of cysts, and mononuclear interstitial inflammation were not significantly associated with this disease when compared with biopsies from patients with chronic kidney injury due to other etiologies. There were, however, morphologic lesions that were strongly associated with NPHP1<ORGANIZATION> deletion including tubular abnormalities such as diverticulum, florets, and macula densa-like change as well as interstitial Tamm-Horsfall aggregates, periglomerular fibrosis, and the absence of arteriosclerosis. Awareness of the histopathologic pattern of injury in nephronophthisis combined with testing for NPHP1<ORGANIZATION> deletion enables renal pathologists to provide a definitive pathologic and genetic diagnosis in a subset of patients with this disease.
