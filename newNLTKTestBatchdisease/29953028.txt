 Identification of deteriorating severe hand, foot, and mouth disease ( HFMD<ORGANIZATION> ) children for referral to intensive care remains problematic.The medical records of 2382 hospitalized children with severe HFMD from May 2013 to September 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. A Pediatric<ORGANIZATION> Early Warning System<GPE> ( PEWS<ORGANIZATION> ) score was designed based on study parameters on admission, evaluated in a logistic regression model, and subsequently validated with different cut-off scores, to predict the risk for clinical deterioration.After admission, 191 cases were transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU<ORGANIZATION> ) and 2191 were admitted to the infectious disease department. Of which, 116 cases were subsequently transferred to PICU<ORGANIZATION>, with younger age, consciousness levels of sluggishness, lethargy or drowsiness, rashes with vesicles on the hands or feet, moderate or high fever, increased or disordered lung marking or pulmonary infiltration, abnormal heart rate, fasting plasma glucose, blood platelet, and C-reactive protein. A corresponding 10-component PEWS<ORGANIZATION> score > 7 was significantly associated with subsequent transfer to PICU.A 10-component PEWS<ORGANIZATION> score > 7 has good specificity but poor sensitivity for identifying severe HFMD<ORGANIZATION> children vulnerable to clinical deterioration.
