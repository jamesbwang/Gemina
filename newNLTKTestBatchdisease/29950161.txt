 Sensory processing deficits are frequently co-morbid with neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, patients with fragile X syndrome ( FXS<ORGANIZATION> ), caused by a silencing of the FMR1<ORGANIZATION> gene, exhibit impairments in visual function specific to the dorsal system, which processes motion information. However, the developmental and circuit mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Recently, the superior colliculus ( SC ), a midbrain structure regulating head and eye movements, has emerged as a model for dissecting visual circuit development and function. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for activity-dependent processes in the development of visual circuitry in the SC<ORGANIZATION>. Based on the known role of the FMR1<ORGANIZATION> gene product in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, we explored the function and organization of visual circuits in the SC<ORGANIZATION> of a mouse model of FXS<ORGANIZATION> ( Fmr1 We utilized in vivo extracellular electrophysiology in combination with computer-controlled visual stimuli to determine the receptive field properties of visual neurons in the SC<ORGANIZATION> of control and Fmr1 Receptive<PERSON> fields of visual neurons in the SC<ORGANIZATION> of Fmr1 Fmr1<PERSON> is required for the proper development of visual circuit organization and function in the SC<ORGANIZATION>. We find that visual dysfunction is heterogeneously manifested in a subcircuit-specific manner in Fmr1<GPE>
