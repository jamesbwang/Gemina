 The 'weekend effect ' describes the phenomenon where patient outcomes appear worse for those admitted at the weekend. It has been used recently to justify significant changes in UK<GPE> health policy. Recent evidence has suggested that the effect may be due to a combination of inadequate correction for confounding factors and inaccurate coding. The effects of these factors were investigated in patients with acute abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients undergoing non-elective AAA<ORGANIZATION> repair entered into the UK National Vascular Registry<ORGANIZATION> from January 2013 until December 2015 were included in a case-control study. The patients were divided according to whether they were treated during the week ( Monday 08.00 hours to Friday 17.00 hours ) or at the weekend. Data<PERSON> extracted included demographics, co-morbidities, preoperative medications and baseline blood test results, as well as outcomes. Coding issues were investigated by looking at patients treated for ruptured, symptomatic or asymptomatic AAA<ORGANIZATION> within the non-elective cohort. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of inpatient stay, and cardiac, respiratory and renal complications. The mortality rate appeared to be higher at the weekend ( odds ratio ( OR ) 1·69, 95 per cent c.i. 1·47 to 1·94 ; P<PERSON> < 0·001 ), but this effect disappeared when confounding factors and coding issues were corrected for ( corrected OR for ruptured AAA<ORGANIZATION> 1·09, 0·92 to 1·29 ; P<PERSON> = 0·330 ). Differences in outcomes were similar for prolonged length of hospital stay ( uncorrected OR 1·21, 95 per cent c.i. 1·06 to 1·37, P<PERSON> = 0·005 ; corrected OR for ruptured AAA<ORGANIZATION> 1·06, 0·91 to 1·10, P<PERSON> = 0·478 ), and morbidity outcomes. After appropriate correction for confounding factors and coding effects, there was no evidence of a significant weekend effect in the treatment of non-elective AAA in the UK<ORGANIZATION>.
