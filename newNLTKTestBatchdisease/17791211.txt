 This work evaluated the efficiency of common ultrasound stimulation ( U.S.S ) types on bacterial growth in vitro using clinically relevant conditions. To estimate different frequencies ultrasound bactericidal ability on bacteria in bacteria of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa<ORGANIZATION>. Six types of U.S.S<GPE> ( continuous wave, 7w/cm Zone of inhibition measurements demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect for continuous wave US.S of 5w/cm The data suggest that for infected wounds, continuous wave US.S of 5w/cm
