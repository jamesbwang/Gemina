 Knee<GPE> osteoarthritis ( KOA<ORGANIZATION> ) is commonly seen and has a high occurrence in the middle-aged and elderly. It is characterized by the degeneration and secondary bone hyperplasia of the articular cartilage ; the pathologic changes are irreversible. Therefore, treatment of KOA<ORGANIZATION> is mainly focused on relieving pain, reducing inflammation, improving or restoring joint function, delaying disease progression, and increasing quality of life. Crossbow needle therapy of the Miao<ORGANIZATION> ethnic minority group is intended for KOA<ORGANIZATION> treatment and has been widely used. Studies of small sample size have seen significant improvement on pain relief, stiffness, and joint function. The trial is a randomized, multicenter, parallel, non-inferiority study. Three hundred and six patients will be randomly assigned to a crossbow needle group ( n = 153 ) and an acupuncture group ( n = 153 ). Patients in each group will receive treatment every other day, three times a week, 20 times in total. Follow-up will be conducted 15 days and 30 days after treatment. The primary outcome will be the Western Ontario<LOCATION> and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index<ORGANIZATION> ( WOMAC<ORGANIZATION> ) score at baseline, the end of treatment, first follow-up, and second follow-up. The secondary outcomes will include Lysholm<PERSON> knee score, Japanese<GPE> Orthopedic Association ( JOA<ORGANIZATION> ) knee score, visual analogue scale ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> ), and the MOS<ORGANIZATION> 36-item short-form health survey ( SF-36 ). The results of the trial will compare the efficacy on KOA<ORGANIZATION> between crossbow needle group and acupuncture group and will be expected to make a systematic and objective evaluation of crossbow needle therapy.
