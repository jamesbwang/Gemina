 Thulium<GPE> laser vaporesection ( ThuVARP<ORGANIZATION> ) and bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate ( B-TURP ) are novel surgeries for benign prostate hyperplasia ( BPH<ORGANIZATION> ). This paper is a systematic review and analysis of literatures comparing efficacy indicators, operative parameters, as well as safety indicators between ThuVARP<ORGANIZATION> and B-TURP for the treatment of BPH<ORGANIZATION>. A systematic search of electronic databases, including PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, the Cochrane Library<ORGANIZATION>, Web of Science<GPE>, Embase<GPE>, and China<GPE> National Knowledge Internet ( CNKI<ORGANIZATION> ), was carried out up to December 1, 2015 ( updated on March 1, 2016 ). The captivating outcomes included basic clinical characteristics, perioperative parameters, local complications, and efficacy indicators which included International Prostate Symptom Score<ORGANIZATION> ( IPSS<ORGANIZATION> ), quality of life ( QoL<ORGANIZATION> ), maximum flow rate ( Qmax<ORGANIZATION> ), and postvoid residual ( PVR<ORGANIZATION> ). After assessing the quality of methodology and extracting data, a meta-analysis was carried out by using STATA 12.0 software. Five studies involving 500 patients met the standard. The outcomes of this analysis were as follows: ( a ) efficacy indicators: there were no significant differences in IPSS<GPE>, QoL<ORGANIZATION>, PVR<ORGANIZATION>, and Qmax<PERSON> between the two groups ( all P > 0.05 ) ; ( b ) perioperative indicators: ThuVARP had longer operative time [ standardized mean difference ( SMD<ORGANIZATION> ) = 0.843 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) - 0.391, 1.296 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ] but less serum hemoglobin decreased ( SMD<ORGANIZATION> = - 0.561 ; 95 % CI<ORGANIZATION> - 0.796, - 0.327 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), shorter hospital stay ( SMD<ORGANIZATION> = - 1.558 ; 95 % CI<ORGANIZATION> - 2.709, - 0.407 ; P<PERSON> < 0.01 ), and catheterization time ( SMD<ORGANIZATION> = - 1.274 ; 95 % CI<ORGANIZATION> - 2.158, - 0.390 ; P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). Additionally, no significant difference was found in estimated resected weight ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ) ; ( c ) safety indicators: no significant difference was found in local complication rates ( all P > 0.05 ) between ThuVARP<ORGANIZATION> and B-TURP. In our analysis, there exists no statistical difference between ThuVARP<ORGANIZATION> and B-TURP group in efficacy. However, in spite of requiring longer surgical time, ThuVARP<ORGANIZATION> was better in terms of less blood loss as well as shorter hospitalization and catheterization time.
