 The Human Immunodeficiency Virus<ORGANIZATION> ( HIV<ORGANIZATION> ) infects cells in the Central Nervous System<ORGANIZATION> ( CNS<ORGANIZATION> ), where the access of antiretrovirals and antibodies that can kill the virus may be challenging. As a result of the early HIV entry in the brain, infected individuals develop inflammation and neurological deficits at various levels, which are aggravated by drugs of abuse. In the non-human primate model of HIV<ORGANIZATION>, we have previously shown that drugs of abuse such as Methamphetamine<GPE> ( Meth<ORGANIZATION> ) increase brain viral load in correlation with a higher number of CCR5-expressing myeloid cells. CCR5<ORGANIZATION> is a chemokine receptor that may be involved in increasing inflammation, but also, it is a co-receptor for viral entry into target cells. CCR5-expressing myeloid cells are the main targets of HIV<ORGANIZATION> in the CNS<ORGANIZATION>. Thus, the identification of factors and mechanisms that impact the expression of CCR5<ORGANIZATION> in the brain is critical, as changes in CCR5<ORGANIZATION> levels may affect the infection in the brain. Using a well-characterized in vitro system, with the THP1<ORGANIZATION> human macrophage cell line, we have investigated the hypothesis that the expression of CCR5<ORGANIZATION> is acutely affected by Meth<ORGANIZATION>, and examined pathways by which this effect could happen. We found that Meth<ORGANIZATION> plays a direct role by regulating the abundance and nuclear translocation of transcription factors with binding sites in the CCR5<ORGANIZATION> promoter. However, we found that the main factor that modifies the CCR5<ORGANIZATION> gene promoter at the epigenetic level towards transcription is Dopamine<GPE> ( DA<ORGANIZATION> ), a neurotransmitter that is produced primarily in brain regions that are rich in dopaminergic neurons. In THP1<ORGANIZATION> cells, the effect of DA<ORGANIZATION> on innate immune CCR5<ORGANIZATION> transcription was mediated by DA<ORGANIZATION> receptors ( DRDs<ORGANIZATION> ), mainly DRD4<ORGANIZATION>. We also identified a role for DRD1<ORGANIZATION> in suppressing CCR5<ORGANIZATION> expression in this myeloid cell system, with potential implications for therapy. The effect of DA<ORGANIZATION> on innate immune CCR5<ORGANIZATION> expression was also detectable on the cell surface during acute time-points, using low doses. In addition, HIV Tat<ORGANIZATION> acted by enhancing the surface expression of CCR5<ORGANIZATION>, in spite of its poor effect on transcription. Overall, our data suggests that the exposure of myeloid cells to Meth<ORGANIZATION> in the context of presence of HIV<ORGANIZATION> peptides such as Tat<PERSON>, may affect the number of HIV<ORGANIZATION> targets by modulating CCR5<ORGANIZATION> expression, through a combination of DA-dependent and-independent mechanisms. Other drugs that increase DA may affect similar mechanisms. The implications of these epigenetic and translational mechanisms in enhancing HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection in the brain and elsewhere are demonstrated.
