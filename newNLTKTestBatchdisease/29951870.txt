 To summarize reports published since the 2013 American Society<ORGANIZATION> of Bone<GPE> and Mineral Research Task Force<ORGANIZATION> Report on atypical femoral fractures ( AFF<ORGANIZATION> ). The absolute incidence of AFFs<ORGANIZATION> remains low. AFFs are primarily associated with prolonged bisphosphonate ( BP ) exposure, but have also been reported in unexposed patients and those receiving denosumab for osteoporosis and metastatic bone disease. Asians may be more susceptible to AFFs<ORGANIZATION>. Lateral femoral bowing and varus hip geometry, which increase loading forces on the lateral femoral cortex, may increase AFF<ORGANIZATION> risk. Altered bone material properties associated with BP<ORGANIZATION> therapy may predispose to AFFs<ORGANIZATION> by permitting initiation and increasing propagation of micro-cracks. Relevant genetic mutations have been reported in patients with AFFs<ORGANIZATION>. Single<PERSON> X-ray absorptiometry femur scans permit early detection of incomplete and/or asymptomatic AFFs<ORGANIZATION>. Orthopedists recommend intramedullary rods for complete AFFs<ORGANIZATION> and for incomplete, radiologically advanced AFFs<ORGANIZATION> associated with pain and/or marrow edema on MRI<ORGANIZATION>. Teriparatide<PERSON> may advance AFF healing but few data support its efficacy. Greater understanding of biological and genetic predisposition to AFF<ORGANIZATION> may allow characterization of individual risk prior to initiating osteoporosis therapy and help allay fear in those at low risk for this complication, which remains rare in comparison to the osteoporotic fractures prevented by antiresorptive therapy.
