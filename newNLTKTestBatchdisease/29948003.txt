 There is paucity of data on patient-perceived outcomes of bleomycin sclerotherapy for low-flow vascular malformations. In this study, the long-term outcomes of bleomycin sclerotherapy were investigated in terms of quality of life ( QoL<ORGANIZATION> ) and patient-perceived changes in health. A cohort of Dutch<GPE> patients with vascular malformations treated with bleomycin sclerotherapy ( June 2010-November 2015 ) completed a questionnaire evaluating disease symptoms, QoL<ORGANIZATION> ( Short<ORGANIZATION> Form 36 ), patient-perceived change in health status ( Global<ORGANIZATION> Rating of Change<GPE> scales ) and treatment satisfaction. QoL<ORGANIZATION> was assessed for the patient 's status before and after treatment and was analyzed relative to an age and sex-matched Dutch<GPE> reference population. Predictive factors associated with QoL<ORGANIZATION> and patient-perceived improvement in overall health status were assessed using multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses, respectively. Seventy-seven patients, with a median follow-up of 22 months, were enrolled. About half of the respondents ( 49.3 % ) indicated that they perceived ( any form of ) improvement in their overall health status. Most often improved were the specific health aspects 'pain ' ( 54.5 % ) and 'overall severity of symptoms ' ( 57.1 % ). No factors were significantly predictive for patient-perceived improvement in health with respect to the vascular malformation. Impairment in work- or study-related activities prior to sclerotherapy was found to negatively impact physical QoL at follow-up ( p = 0.03 ). Approximately half of patients with low-flow vascular malformations indicate an improvement in overall health status following bleomycin sclerotherapy, particularly concerning pain and severity of symptoms. However, most patients only perceived little to moderate improvement to their health and desire further treatment.
