 In the treatment of serious and symptomatic coronary heart disease ( CHD<ORGANIZATION> ), coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG<ORGANIZATION> ) is a frequently utilized intervention. In addition, the risk of CHD<ORGANIZATION> is strongly associated with the low activity of paraoxonase-1 ( PON1<ORGANIZATION> ), whose 3'-UTR harbors an rs3735590 polymorphism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the rs3735590 polymorphism could be used as a prognosis marker in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ) patients undergoing CABG<ORGANIZATION>. In addition, the hypothesis, i.e., the rs3735590 polymorphism may be involved in the regulation of PON1<ORGANIZATION> gene expression via modulating its interaction with miRNAs<ORGANIZATION>, was tested in this study. 292 patients diagnosed with COPD<ORGANIZATION> and treated with CABG<ORGANIZATION> were recruited for this study. Genomic DNA<PERSON> was extracted from clinical samples, and real-time quantitative PCR<ORGANIZATION> and Western-blot were used to measure the expression of miR-616 and PON1<ORGANIZATION> in liver cells of different genotypes. 292 COPD patients were divided into three groups according to their genotypes, i.e., rs3735590: CC ( 212 ), TC<GPE> ( 75 ), and TT<ORGANIZATION> ( 5 ), respectively ( TC<ORGANIZATION> and TT were merged in one group of T carriers for statistical analyses ). Patients with the CC<ORGANIZATION> genotype were associated with a shorter event-free survival time as compared to patients with the T genotypes. In addition, PON1<ORGANIZATION> was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-616, while experiments with primary cells of different genotypes showed that miR-616 inhibited the expression of PON1<ORGANIZATION> in CC cells. On the contrary, rs3735590 impaired such inhibitory effect of miR-616 in TT cells. The rs3735590 polymorphism of PON1<ORGANIZATION> acts as a prognostic biomarker in COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients treated by CABG<ORGANIZATION>.
