 In South Korea<GPE>, the National Immunization Program<ORGANIZATION> offers a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPSV23<ORGANIZATION> ) for the elderly ; however, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV13<ORGANIZATION> ) is not included, and vaccination is not offered to younger, at-risk populations. This study offers a comparative analysis of PCV13<ORGANIZATION> and PPSV23<ORGANIZATION> in Korea<GPE> 's adults, stratified by age and risk group. A Markov<PERSON> model with a lifetime horizon was developed from the healthcare perspective. Data sources included the Health Insurance Review<ORGANIZATION> & Assessment Service<ORGANIZATION>, Korea Centre<PERSON> for Disease Control<PERSON> & Prevention and Korean<GPE> medical institutions. An expert panel tested data validity. The CAPiTA<ORGANIZATION> trial and Cochrane<ORGANIZATION> meta-analysis were used to obtain vaccine effectiveness data. Regardless of co-morbidity, when the sequential PCV13-PPSV23 strategy was compared to that using PPSV23-only, in elderly populations, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER<ORGANIZATION> ) was 3,300 USD per quality-adjusted life years ( QALY<ORGANIZATION> ). For the risk group aged ≥65 years, the ICER<ORGANIZATION> of the addition of PCV13<ORGANIZATION> over the existing PPSV23-only strategy was 3,404 USD/QALY. However, on replacing PPSV23<ORGANIZATION> with PCV13<ORGANIZATION>, for all elderly populations, an ICER of 1,421 USD/QALY resulted ; for the risk group aged ≥65 years, the ICER<ORGANIZATION> was 1,736 USD/QALY. For the 18-64 year-old risk group, the sequential PCV13-PPSV23 strategy yielded an ICER of 3,629 USD/QALY over the PPSV23-only strategy, and 6,643 USD/QALY compared to no vaccination. Thus, the PCV13→PPSV23 combination strategy for elderly populations was found to be a cost-effective alternative to the current National Immunization<ORGANIZATION> Program regardless of co-morbidity. This finding was the same as that for younger, at-risk populations.
