 Cystoventriculostomy<GPE> is a surgical treatment for arachnoid cysts. We present a case using a neuroendovascular stent to maintain ostomy patency. A 6Â½-year-old male with symptomatic arachnoid cyst underwent endoscopic fenestration and Wingspan<GPE> stent insertion. Neuroendovascular stent placement may be an adjunct to maintain patency in cystoventriculostomy.
