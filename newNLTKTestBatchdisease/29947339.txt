 The high polymorphism in the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA<ORGANIZATION> ) genes can be used as an identity of individuals to compare with other populations. This extreme polymorphism in the HLA<ORGANIZATION> system is accountable for the differences in alleles and haplotypes among ethnic groups, populations, and the inhabitants of many regions. To define the frequency of HLA<ORGANIZATION> alleles and haplotypes among the Sistanis<ORGANIZATION>, Sistani/Zaboli population in Iran<GPE>. In this study, genotyping of class I ( A, B<GPE>, C ) and class II HLA ( DRB1<ORGANIZATION>, DQA1<ORGANIZATION>, DQB1<ORGANIZATION> ) loci were determined in 90 unrelated Iraninan<GPE> Sistani people and the results were compared with 474,892 HLA chromosomes from a diverse worldwide population. The highest frequently observed alleles in this study were A*02:01, B*35:01, C*12:03, C*06:02, DRB1*11, DQA1*05:05, and DQB1*03:01. Furthermore, the most frequent 3-locus haplotypes were A*02:01-B*50:01*C*06:02, DRB1*11-DQB1*03:01-DQA1*05:05, and A*02:01-B*50:01-DRB1*07. The most occurring 4-locus haplotypes were A*02:01-B*50:01-C*06:02-DRB1*07 and A*02:01-B*50:01-DRB1*07-DQB1*02:01. A*02:01-B*50:01-C*06:02-DRB1*07-DQB1*02:01 and A*02:01-B*50:01-C*06:02-DRB1*07-DQB1*02:01-DQA1*02:01 were determined to be the predominant 5- and 6-locus haplotypes, respectively. The heat maps and multiple correspondence analyses based on the frequency of HLA<ORGANIZATION> alleles showed that Sistanis<PERSON> share a common genetic inheritance with other Iranian<GPE> ethnic groups such as the people from Yazd<GPE> and Fars<PERSON> except some differences with Baluchis<PERSON>, Iranian Jews<GPE>, Lurs<PERSON> of Kohgiluyeh/Buyerahmad, and Arabs<PERSON> of Fars<GPE>, which may arise from the admixture of these groups or with foreign subgroups over centuries, and also a close relatedness with some European<GPE> populations. These data could be useful for finding better donor matches for organ transplantation among Sistanis<PERSON> or other related Iranian<GPE> ethnic groups, epidemiological studies of HLA-associated diseases, handling HLA<ORGANIZATION> genomics and mapping the migration pattern of different ethnic group.
