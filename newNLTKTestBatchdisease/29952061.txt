 Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD<ORGANIZATION> ) is defined as a slow, progressive disorder of the lower extremity arterial vessels characterized by chronic narrowing that often results in occlusion and is associated with loss of functional capacity. Although the PAD<ORGANIZATION> occurrence rate is increasing in the elderly population, outcomes with current treatment strategies are suboptimal. Hence<PERSON>, there is an urgent need to develop new technologies that overcome limitations of traditional modalities for PAD<ORGANIZATION> detection and therapy. In this Review, the application of nanotechnology as a tool that bridges the gap in PAD<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis and therapy is in focus. Several materials including synthetic, natural, biodegradable, and biocompatible materials are used to develop nanoparticles for PAD<ORGANIZATION> diagnostic and/or therapeutic applications. Moreover, various recent research approaches are being explored to diagnose PAD<ORGANIZATION> through multimodality imaging with different nanoplatforms. Further efforts include targeted delivery of various therapeutic agents using nanostructures as carriers to treat PAD<ORGANIZATION>. Last, but not least, despite being a fairly new field, researchers are exploring the use of nanotheranostics for PAD<ORGANIZATION> detection and therapy.
