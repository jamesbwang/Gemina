 Data on the benefits of perioperative prophylactic antibiotics in the paediatric population are lacking. In this study, we aimed to assess the rate of infection after isolated soft-tissue procedures in patients with cerebral palsy with and without preoperative prophylactic antibiotics between 2009 and 2015. We reviewed the records of all children with cerebral palsy who underwent isolated soft-tissue procedures ( on the upper and lower limb ) at our hospital between 2009 and 2015. Children with at least 30-day postoperative follow-up were included. Children who had groin incisions were excluded. Two groups were identified: the antibiotic group ( 77 children with 203 incisions and 343 procedures ) had one surgical site infection ; the no-antibiotic group ( 48 children with 102 incisions and 177 procedures ) had no surgical site infections. These results suggest that the use of preoperative antibiotics does not change the rate of postoperative surgical site infections. Level III<PERSON> therapeutic study.
