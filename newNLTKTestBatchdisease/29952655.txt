 ( 1 ) Identify knowledge deficits in this cohort regarding basic conditions treated by an otolaryngologist. ( 2 ) Determine the training needs of these physicians regarding the care of the head and neck patient. This cross-sectional assessment used a 10-question, multiple-choice assessment administered to medical students and resident physicians at the University<ORGANIZATION> of California<GPE>, Davis<PERSON>, University<ORGANIZATION> of California<GPE>, San Francisco<PERSON>, and University<ORGANIZATION> of West Virginia<GPE> in the departments of emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, and otolaryngology. The otolaryngology cohort scored an average of 93 %, while all others scored 56 %. There was no statistical difference in the results between fourth-year medical students and non-otolaryngology residents of any year. Only 16 % of the primary care providers and students assessed felt comfortable with these conditions, and 86 % ( 321/372 ) of the respondents desired increased education on these topics. This study identified significant knowledge gaps among non-otolaryngologists in the diagnosis and treatment of basic head and neck conditions. As a specialty, a greater focus should be placed on improving the familiarity of our primary care colleagues on these conditions.
