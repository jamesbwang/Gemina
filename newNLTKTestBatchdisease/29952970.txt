 Acute<GPE> pancreatitis in pregnancy ( APIP<ORGANIZATION> ) is a rare but dangerous complication. APIP<ORGANIZATION> has common symptoms with acute abdomen. Assessment of an acute abdomen is more complicated during pregnancy because the gravid uterus could mask most of symptomatic signs. It has been a challenge to diagnose APIP<ORGANIZATION> by physical examination or diagnostic imaging. Case studies on APIP<ORGANIZATION> are also limited for analysis on the risk factors associated with the disease. This retrospective study evaluated a series of risk factors from a relatively substantial number of APIP<ORGANIZATION> cases to determine early predictors or prognosis markers for APIP.Fifty-nine APIP patients together with 179 random normal pregnant women in Shengjing Affiliated Hospital<ORGANIZATION> of China<GPE> Medical University<ORGANIZATION> were included for this retrospective study. Medical<ORGANIZATION> parameters of blood test in biochemistry and hematology were compared between 2 groups using t test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between various factors and APIP<ORGANIZATION> using Statistical Applied Software<PERSON> ( SAS<ORGANIZATION> student version ) .Compared with normal pregnant women, APIP<ORGANIZATION> patients have elevated values in alanine aminotransferase ( ALT<ORGANIZATION> ), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST<ORGANIZATION> ), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, C-reactive protein, direct bilirubin, fibrin degradation products, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT<ORGANIZATION> ), glucose, lipase, pH<ORGANIZATION> and decreased values in albumin, fibrinogen, high-density lipoprotein ( HDL<ORGANIZATION> ), hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-D ), and total proteins from their blood tests. In addition, APIP<ORGANIZATION> patients have decreased numbers in red cells but increased numbers in white blood cells and increased ratio of neutrophil/lymphocyte ( N/L ). Among these factors, N/LR, GGT<ORGANIZATION>, lipase, and HDL<ORGANIZATION> are significantly associated with APIP<ORGANIZATION>. This study suggests that the combination of those factors serve as a panel of indicators for early-onset prognosis of APIP.GGT, lipase, HDL<ORGANIZATION>, and N/LR can serve as a panel of factors to predict APIP<ORGANIZATION>. More case studies are important to further evaluate the predicting power of this panel factors in APIP<GPE>.
