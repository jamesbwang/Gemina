 Chronic<GPE> spontaneous urticaria ( CSU<ORGANIZATION> ) is a challenging condition to treat and it significantly affects quality of life. Bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections have been associated with triggering and/or perpetuating urticaria in certain individuals. There is a paucity of literature on CSU<ORGANIZATION> associated with Malassezia<GPE> infection. We present a case series of five patients with CSU<ORGANIZATION> without angioedema in whom we observed temporal association of Malassezia<GPE> infection with CSU<ORGANIZATION>. The presence of Malassezia<GPE> was confirmed by clinical examination, Wood<PERSON> 's lamp, and KOH<ORGANIZATION> examination. The patients with CSU<ORGANIZATION> experienced improvement after specific antifungal therapy. Malassezia<PERSON> infection may be associated with recurrent and chronic urticaria in a certain group of susceptible patients and thus specific targeted therapy against it might result in complete remission of urticaria along with clearing of the infection.
