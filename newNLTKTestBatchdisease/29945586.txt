 Fluid<GPE> overload ( FO ) is associated with unfavorable outcomes in critically ill children. Clinicians are encouraged to avoid FO<ORGANIZATION> ; however, strategies to avoid FO are not well-described in pediatrics. Our aim was to implement a bundle strategy to prevent FO in children with sepsis and pARDS<ORGANIZATION> and to compare the outcomes with a historical cohort. A quality improvement initiative, known as preemptive fluid strategy ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) was implemented to prevent early FO, in a 12-bed general PICU<ORGANIZATION>. Infants on mechanical ventilation ( MV ) fulfilling pARDS<ORGANIZATION> and sepsis criteria were prospectively recruited. For comparison, data from a historical cohort from 2015, with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, was retrospectively reviewed. The PFS<ORGANIZATION> bundle consisted of 1. maintenance of intravenous fluids ( MIVF<ORGANIZATION> ) at 50 % of requirements ; 2. drug volume reduction ; 3. dynamic monitoring of preload markers to determine the need for fluid bolus administration ; 4. early use of diuretics ; and 5. early initiation of enteral feeds. The historical cohort treatment, the standard fluid strategy ( SFS<ORGANIZATION> ), were based on physician preferences. Peak<PERSON> fluid overload ( PFO<ORGANIZATION> ) was the primary outcome. PFO<ORGANIZATION> was defined as the highest FO during the first 72 h. FO was calculated as ( cumulative fluid input - cumulative output ) /kg*100. Fluid<PERSON> input/output were registered every 12 h for 72 h. Thirty-seven patients were included in the PFS<ORGANIZATION> group ( 54 % male, 6 mo ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 2,11 ) ) and 39 with SFS<ORGANIZATION> ( 64 % male, 3 mo ( IQR1,7 ) ). PFO<ORGANIZATION> was lower in PFS<GPE> ( 6.31 % [ IQR4.4-10 ] ) compared to SFS<ORGANIZATION> ( 12 % [ IQR8.4-15.8 ] ). FO was lower in PFS<ORGANIZATION> compared to CFS<ORGANIZATION> as early as 12 h after admission [ 2.4 ( 1.4,3.7 ) v/s 4.3 ( 1.5,5.5 ), p < 0.01 ] and maintained during the study. These differences were due to less fluid input ( MIVF<ORGANIZATION> and fluid boluses ). There were no differences in the renal function test. PRBC<ORGANIZATION> requirements were lower during the first 24 h in the PFS<ORGANIZATION> ( 5 % ) compared to SFS<ORGANIZATION> ( 28 %, p < 0.05 ). MV duration was 81 h ( 58,98 ) in PFS<ORGANIZATION> and 118 h ( 85154 ) in SFS<GPE> ( p < 0.05 ). PICU<ORGANIZATION> LOS in PFS<ORGANIZATION> was 5 ( 4, 7 ) and in SFS<ORGANIZATION> was 8 ( 6, 10 ) days. Implementation of a bundle to prevent FO in children on MV with pARDS<ORGANIZATION> and sepsis resulted in less PFO<ORGANIZATION>. We observed a decrease in MV<GPE> duration and PICU<ORGANIZATION> LOS. Future studies are needed to address if PFS<ORGANIZATION> might have a positive impact on health outcomes.
