 In the last decades, developmental origins of health and disease ( DOHaD<ORGANIZATION> ) has emerged as a central framework for studying early-life effects, that is, the impact of fetal and early postnatal experience on adult functioning. Apace with empirical progress, theoreticians have built mathematical models that provide novel insights for DOHaD<ORGANIZATION>. This article focuses on three of these insights, which show the power of environmental noise ( i.e., imperfect indicators of current and future conditions ) in shaping development. Such noise can produce: ( a ) detrimental outcomes even in ontogenetically stable environments, ( b ) individual differences in sensitive periods, and ( c ) early-life effects tailored to predicted future somatic states. We argue that these insights extend DOHaD<ORGANIZATION> and offer new research directions.
