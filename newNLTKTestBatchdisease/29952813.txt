 Zumba<GPE> fitness ( ZF ) is a well-known exercise program involving dance and fitness. Despite its increasing popularity, no analysis has been conducted on studies focusing on the cardiovascular ( CV ) profile of women who performed this activity. The aim of this systematic review is to provide insights into the impact of ZF<ORGANIZATION> on women 's CV<ORGANIZATION> health. Five clinical databases were searched. To be included, the articles had to include ( 1 ) women with or without CV<ORGANIZATION> risk factors ( CVRF<ORGANIZATION> ) and ( 2 ) CV-related outcomes resulting from a ZF program. Ten studies ( 322 women ; 181 healthy, 141 with CVRF<ORGANIZATION> ) were included. In healthy women, low absolute effect sizes for maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max<ORGANIZATION> ), anthropometric and body composition profile after 8 and 12 wk of ZF were found compared with nonparticipants. Moderate to large absolute effect sizes were recorded for VO2max<ORGANIZATION> and body composition following 40 wk of ZF<ORGANIZATION>. Findings proved promising but less consistent for ZF<ORGANIZATION> studies involving women with CVRF<ORGANIZATION> due to the absence of control groups. Data<PERSON> describe ZF as feasible for healthy women and a promising fitness option for those with CVRF<ORGANIZATION>. Because of the low quality of the studies on women with CVRF<ORGANIZATION> and the overall small sample size along with discrepancies such as the average length of the studies on healthy women, cautious interpretation of the findings is recommended. Further investigations with a standardized design are needed to verify whether ZF<ORGANIZATION> may be considered as an alternative fitness option in primary prevention of CV<ORGANIZATION> disease in women.
