 Meta<GPE> analysis was used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Dynesys<GPE> and posterior decompression and fusion internal fixation for lumbar degenerative diseases. The computer was used to retrieve the Cochrane<ORGANIZATION> library, Medline<PERSON>, Embase<GPE>, CNKI<ORGANIZATION>, Wanfang<PERSON> database and Chinese<GPE> biomedical literature database ; and the references and main Chinese<GPE> and English Department<ORGANIZATION> of orthopedics journals were manually searched. All the prospective or retrospective comparative studies on the clinical efficacy and safety of Dynesys<GPE> and posterior decompression and fusion internal fixation were collected, so as to evaluate the methodological quality of the study and to extract the data. The RevMan<ORGANIZATION> 5.2 software provided by Cochrane<ORGANIZATION> collaboration was used for systematic evaluation. A total of 9 clinical studies were included, including 3 prospective randomized controlled trials ( RCT<ORGANIZATION> ) and 6 retrospective controlled observational studies, which included 692 patients, with 336 cases in Dynesys<GPE> group, and 356 cases in posterior decompression and fusion internal fixation ( PLIF<ORGANIZATION> ) group. The results showed that compared with PLIF<ORGANIZATION>, Dynesys<GPE> system significantly decreased operation time ( Both Dynesys system and PLIF<ORGANIZATION> can improve clinical outcomes of lumbar degenerative diseases effectively. Compared with PLIF<ORGANIZATION>, Dynesys<PERSON> could remain the range of motion ( ROM<ORGANIZATION> ) of surgical segments with less increased ROM<ORGANIZATION> of adjacent segments and lower complication incidence rate. But the ability to prevent adjacent segments degeneration needs more RCTs<ORGANIZATION> with long-term follow-up to confirm.
