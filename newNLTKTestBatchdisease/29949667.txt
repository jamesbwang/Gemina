 The aim of this study was to identify if prolonged length of hospital stay was protective for certain post-discharge complications requiring readmission after pancreatectomy. Patients undergoing elective pancreatectomy from 2012 to 2013 were identified in the American College<ORGANIZATION> of Surgeons National Surgical Quality<ORGANIZATION> Improvement Program ( ACS-NSQIP ). Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to elucidate the association of length of hospital stay ( LOS<ORGANIZATION> ), in-hospital complications, and post-discharge complications with 30-day hospital readmission. Mean LOS<PERSON> for the readmitted versus not readmitted cohort was 9.01 and 10.36, respectively ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). Approximately half of hospital readmissions occur within 7 days of discharge from the hospital. The readmission rate ( after hospital discharge ) for patients with any in-hospital complication was 13.2 %. On the other hand, the readmission rate for patients with any post-discharge complication was 70.8 %. Readmission rates were above 85 % for patients with the following post-discharge complications: organ/space surgical site infection ( SSI<ORGANIZATION> ), pneumonia, ventilator dependence greater than 48 h, progressive renal insufficiency, sepsis, and septic shock. In a multivariate logistic regression model, prolonged LOS<ORGANIZATION> reduced the odds of any post-discharge complication requiring readmission ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.68, P<PERSON> = 0.01 ). Specifically, prolonged LOS<ORGANIZATION> reduced the odds of a post-discharge organ/space SSI requiring readmission ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.72, P<PERSON> = 0.02 ). Readmission after pancreatectomy primarily occurs due to a new post-discharge event. Furthermore, increased LOS<ORGANIZATION> is protective for readmission for post-pancreatectomy complications, particularly those due to post-discharge organ space SSIs<ORGANIZATION>. Our findings suggest that solely focusing on reducing LOS<ORGANIZATION> in pancreatectomy may lead to the unintended consequence of increasing readmission rates.
