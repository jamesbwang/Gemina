 Obesity<GPE> is a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). However, it remains to be fully examined whether fatness is more useful in predicting incident CKD<ORGANIZATION>. We aimed this study to determine the association of body fat, body mass index and waist circumference ( WC ) with subsequent changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) and incident CKD in young- to middle-aged working men. We analyzed data from annual health check-up in male workers aged from 20 to 60 years with basal eGFR of 60-90<ORGANIZATION> mL/min/1.73 m There were 8,015 men participants. During the 5-year follow-up, 11.0 % of the participants ( N = 878 ) had developed to incident CKD<ORGANIZATION>. When basal WC was greater than 80.0 cm, which was decided by Youden<PERSON> 's Index<GPE>, there was a significantly higher risk of incident CKD<ORGANIZATION> [ OR 1.57 ( 95 % confident interval 1.35-1.84 ) ]. Changes in WC over 5 years were significantly related to eGFR decline in young men ( < 40 years old ) with normal blood pressures and normoglycemia. These findings suggest that WC<ORGANIZATION> > 80.0 cm is a risk factor for incident CKD<ORGANIZATION> and strongly associated with a decline in eGFR<ORGANIZATION> in the young- to middle-aged working healthy men.
