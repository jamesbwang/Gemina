 Lysyl<GPE> oxidase-like 2 ( LOXL2<ORGANIZATION> ) is a copper-dependent monoamine oxidase that contributes to the remodelling of the extracellular matrix ( ECM<ORGANIZATION> ) by cross linkage of collagen and elastin fibres and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in cancer and fibrosis. In the skin, LOXL2<ORGANIZATION> is essential for epidermal cell polarity and differentiation. However, its role in the dermis has not been evaluated. We found that Loxl2<PERSON> is dispensable for mouse dermal development, maturation and homeostasis, yet affects dermal stiffness. Neither loss of Loxl2<GPE> nor increased Loxl2<PERSON> expression affected dermal architecture following treatment with the phorbol ester TPA<ORGANIZATION>. Furthermore, Loxl2<GPE> expression did not alter the stroma of DMBA-TPA-induced tumours. We conclude that, although Loxl2<PERSON> is expressed in both dermis and epidermis, its function appears largely confined to the epidermis.
