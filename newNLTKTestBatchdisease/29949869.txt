 Peroxisome<GPE> proliferator activated receptors ( PPARs<ORGANIZATION> ) are a class of ligand-activated transcription factors, belonging to the superfamily of receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones, retinoids, and vitamin D. PPARs control the expression of several genes connected with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and it has been demonstrated that PPARs<ORGANIZATION> play important roles in determining neural stem cell ( NSC<ORGANIZATION> ) fate. Lipogenesis<PERSON> and aerobic glycolysis support the rapid proliferation during neurogenesis, and specific roles for PPARs<ORGANIZATION> in the control of different phases of neurogenesis have been demonstrated. Understanding the changes in metabolism during neuronal differentiation is important in the context of stem cell research, neurodegenerative diseases, and regenerative medicine. In this review, we will discuss pivotal evidence that supports the role of PPARs<ORGANIZATION> in energy metabolism alterations during neuronal maturation and neurodegenerative disorders.
