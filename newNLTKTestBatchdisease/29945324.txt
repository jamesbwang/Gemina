 Myocardial infarction ( MI ) is an irreversible damage of myocardial tissue caused by prolonged ischemia and hypoxia. A local hypoxia-induced inflammation causes recruitment of leukocytes to the inflammatory site to aid cardiac remodeling and tissue healing. Among various chemokines involved in the process, CCL22<ORGANIZATION> plays an essential role in cardiac cell migrations. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of rs4359426 and rs2228428 SNPs<ORGANIZATION> in CCL22/CCR4 genes of MI<ORGANIZATION> patients and studied their association with the physiology of the disease. Two hundred patients aged 30 - 70 years diagnosed with myocardial infarction along with 200 agematched healthy controls were registered in the study and their pathophysiological findings were recorded. Genotypic analysis of rs4359426 and rs2228428 in CCL22<ORGANIZATION> and CCR4<ORGANIZATION> genes, respectively, were carried out in patients using PCR-RFLP method and compared with the control group. Successively genotyped SNPs<ORGANIZATION> were reviewed for their possible association with the disease or physiological findings using Fisher<PERSON> 's exact test. The frequency of CC<ORGANIZATION> genotypes atboth SNPs rs4359426 and rs2228428 in CCL22<ORGANIZATION> and CCR4<ORGANIZATION> genes was significantly higher in MI patients compared to other genotypes. Although we could not establish any direct association with the disease due to restricted population size, it is possible that CC<ORGANIZATION> genotypesin CCL22<ORGANIZATION> and CCR4<ORGANIZATION> could be considered as risk factors in myocardial infarction.
