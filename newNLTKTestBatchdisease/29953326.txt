 Guillain-Barr√© syndrome ( GBS<ORGANIZATION> ), the most common cause of acute neuromuscular weakness and paralysis worldwide, encompasses a group of acute immune-mediated disorders restricted to peripheral nerves and roots. Immune-mediated attack of peripheral nervous system myelin, axons or both is presumed to be triggered by molecular mimicry, with both cell- and humoral-dependent mechanisms implicated in disease pathogenesis. Good circumstantial evidence exists for a pathogenic role for molecular mimicry in GBS<ORGANIZATION> pathogenesis, especially with its axonal forms, providing insights that could guide future immunotherapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg<ORGANIZATION> ) and plasma exchange ( PE ) are the most commonly prescribed immunotherapies for GBS<ORGANIZATION> with variable efficacy dependent on GBS<ORGANIZATION> subtype, severity at initial presentation and other clinical and electrophysiologic prognostic factors. The mechanisms of action of IVIg<ORGANIZATION> and PE are not known definitely. Despite recent significant advances in molecular biology that provide insights into GBS<ORGANIZATION> pathogenesis, no advances in therapeutics or significant improvements in patient outcomes have occurred over the past three decades. We summarize the clinical aspects of GBS<ORGANIZATION>, its current pathogenesis and immunotherapy, and highlight the potential of leukocyte trafficking inhibitors as novel disease-specific immunotherapeutic drugs.
