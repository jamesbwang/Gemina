 Chaihu<PERSON> Jia Longgu Muli Tang<PERSON> is a classical Chinese<GPE> formulas treating Shaoyang<PERSON> syndrome complicated with Yangming<ORGANIZATION> syndrome according to Treatise<GPE> on Febrile Diseases. This formula is used in mental disorder, nervous system, gynecologic, andrologic, and cardiovascular disease. However, its therapeutic effect on ischemia stroke and its mechanism is far from clear. In clinical practice, we have found that this formula is effective in treating ischemic stroke, which can shorten the course of the disease and reduce recurrence. The characteristics of this formula include: Shaoyang<PERSON> cardinal disadvantageous syndrome, mental and nervous symptoms, retained fluid punched upward syndrome and accumulation of heat in the stomach and intestines. By combining traditional Chinese<GPE> medicine ( TCM<ORGANIZATION> ) pathogenesis and efficacy with modern pathology and pharmacology, we proposed that the TCM<ORGANIZATION> pathogenesis of stroke, which is characterized by hyperactivity of heat combining with phlegm, stasis and water drink, is consistent with syndromes and corresponding pathology targeted by Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang<PERSON>, including the stress brain edema zone around the ischemic lesion, the increase of intracranial pressure, the excitement of sympathetic nerve, the release of monoamine neurotransmitter, the hypofunction of autonomic nervous system after stroke, and gastrointestinal stress response. Furthermore, the pharmacological mechanism of Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang<PERSON> is concentrated on regulation the neuroendocrinology system centered by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA<ORGANIZATION> ), participating in the process of neuron regeneration and apoptosis, oxidative stress, hyperactivity of sympathetic nerve, and inflammatory reaction. These pathological processes are consistent with the pathological changes after ischemic stroke. Therefore, Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang<PERSON> is a key formula for treating ischemic stroke.
