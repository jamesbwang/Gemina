 Immunomodulatory monoclonal IgG1<ORGANIZATION> antibodies developed for cancer and autoimmune disease have an inherent risk of systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vitro cytokine release assays are currently used to predict cytokine release syndrome ( CRS<ORGANIZATION> ) risk, but the validation of these preclinical tools suffers from the limited number of characterized CRS-inducing IgG1 antibodies and the poor understanding of the mechanisms regulating cytokine release. Here, we incubated human whole blood from naïve healthy volunteers with four monoclonal IgG1<ORGANIZATION> antibodies with different proven or predicted capacity to elicit CRS<ORGANIZATION> in clinic and measured cytokine release using a multiplex assay. We found that, in contrast to anti-CD52 antibodies ( Campath-1H homolog ) that elicited high level of multiple inflammatory cytokines from human blood cells in vitro, other IgG1<ORGANIZATION> antibodies with CRS-inducing potential consistently induced release of a single tested cytokine, interferon ( IFN<ORGANIZATION> ) -γ, with a smaller magnitude than Campath<PERSON>. IFN-γ expression was observed as early as 2-4 h after incubation, mediated by natural killer cells, and dependent upon tumor necrosis factor and FcγRIII<ORGANIZATION>. Importantly, the magnitude of the IFN-γ response elicited by IgG1<ORGANIZATION> antibodies with CRS-inducing potential was determined by donor FcγRIIIa-V158F polymorphism. Overall, our results highlight the importance of FcγRIIIa-dependent IFN-γ release in preclinical cytokine release assay for the prediction of CRS<ORGANIZATION> risk associated with therapeutic IgG1<ORGANIZATION> antibodies.
