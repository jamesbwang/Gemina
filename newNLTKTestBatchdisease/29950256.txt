 To study the gene expression of Glyoxalase<ORGANIZATION> II among patients of diabetic retinopathy. A cross-sectional comparative study. CREAM<ORGANIZATION> ( Centre<ORGANIZATION> for Research in Experimental<GPE> and Applied Medicine<PERSON> ) and the Department<ORGANIZATION> of Biochemistry<ORGANIZATION> and Molecular Biology<PERSON>, Army Medical College<ORGANIZATION>, Rawalpindi<GPE> in collaboration with Armed Forces Institute<PERSON> of Ophthalmology<GPE> ( AFIO<ORGANIZATION> ), Rawalpindi<GPE>, from November 2015 to November 2016. Individuals were enrolled, among whom 30 were cases with diabetic retinopathy and 30 were controls without the disease. Their relevant data were collected and blood samples were drawn. Individual RNA<PERSON> was extracted from respective samples and cDNA<ORGANIZATION> was synthesised from each. Expression analysis for Glyoxalase<ORGANIZATION> II was done and relative quantification was done using delta delta CT method. A total of 60 individuals of ages 40-70 years were enrolled in the study, 30 cases and 30 controls. Among these, 34 ( 56.67 % ) were males and 26 ( 43.3 % ) were females. Mean ages were 60 ±8 years in cases and 59 ±13 years in controls. Down<PERSON> regulation of Glyoxalase<ORGANIZATION> II was observed in cases as compared to controls. Downregulation of Glyoxalase<ORGANIZATION> II, seen among patients of diabetic retinopathy, may indicate a failure of detoxifying system leading to accumulation of glycated end products.
