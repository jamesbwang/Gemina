 RGS2<ORGANIZATION> is a key modulator of stress in human airway epithelial cells, especially of hyperresponsiveness and mucin hypersecretion, both features of cystic fibrosis ( CF ). Because its expression can be modulated through the DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation pathway, we hypothesize that RGS2<ORGANIZATION> is downregulated by DNA<ORGANIZATION> hypermethylation in CF airway epithelial cells. This downregulation would then lead to an enhanced inflammatory response. We demonstrated RGS2<ORGANIZATION> transcript and protein downregulation in cultured airway epithelial cells from CF<ORGANIZATION> patients and validated our findings in 2 CF epithelial cell lines. A methylated DNA<ORGANIZATION> immunoprecipitation array showed the presence of methylated cytosine on 13 gene promoters in CF. Among these genes, we confirmed that the RGS2<ORGANIZATION> promoter was hypermethylated by using bisulfite conversion coupled with a methylation-specific PCR<ORGANIZATION> assay. Finally, we showed that downregulation of RGS2<ORGANIZATION> in non-CF cells increases the expression of S100A12<GPE>, a proinflammatory marker. These results highlight the importance of epigenetic regulation in gene expression in CF and show that RGS2<ORGANIZATION> might modulate the inflammatory response in CF through DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation control.
