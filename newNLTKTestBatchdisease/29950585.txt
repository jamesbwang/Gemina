 There is currently a lack of an efficient, objective and systemic approach towards the classification of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ), due to its complex etiology and pathogenesis. As AD<ORGANIZATION> is inherently dynamic, it is also not clear how the relationships among AD indicators vary over time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid computational approach for AD<ORGANIZATION> classification and evaluate it on the heterogeneous longitudinal AIBL<ORGANIZATION> dataset. Specifically, using clinical dementia rating as an index of AD<ORGANIZATION> severity, the most important indicators ( mini-mental state examination, logical memory recall, grey matter and cerebrospinal volumes from MRI<ORGANIZATION> and active voxels from PiB-PET brain scans, ApoE<ORGANIZATION>, and age ) can be automatically identified from parallel data mining algorithms. In this work, Bayesian<GPE> network modelling across different time points is used to identify and visualize time-varying relationships among the significant features, and importantly, in an efficient way using only coarse-grained data. Crucially, our approach suggests key data features and their appropriate combinations that are relevant for AD<ORGANIZATION> severity classification with high accuracy. Overall, our study provides insights into AD<ORGANIZATION> developments and demonstrates the potential of our approach in supporting efficient AD diagnosis.
