 Quercetin<GPE> ( QCT<ORGANIZATION> ) has been known as a potential therapeutic strategy for gastrointestinal diseases because it contributes to the stabilization of mast cells, the prevention of histamine release and modulation of CaCC<ORGANIZATION> chloride channel. We investigated the laxative effect and action mechanism of QCT<ORGANIZATION> in Lop-induced constipation model. Constipation of SD<ORGANIZATION> rats was induced by subcutaneous injection of loperamide ( Lop ) ( 4 mg/kg weight ) in 0.5 % Tween 20 twice a day for three days. After 24 h, the constipation group was further treated with 1Ã— PBS ( Lop<ORGANIZATION> + Vehicle<PERSON> treated group ), 10 mg/kg of QCT<ORGANIZATION> ( Lop<ORGANIZATION> + LQCT<ORGANIZATION> treated group ), 20 mg/kg of QCT<ORGANIZATION> ( Lop<ORGANIZATION> + MQCT<ORGANIZATION> treated group ) or 40 mg/kg QCT<ORGANIZATION> ( Lop<ORGANIZATION> + HQCT<ORGANIZATION> treated group ) at once. At 24 h after QCT<ORGANIZATION> treatment, the constipation phenotypes were measured and the transverse colon was collected from SD<ORGANIZATION> rats. The gastrointestinal motility, the number of stools and histological structures were significantly recovered in Lop<GPE> + QCT<ORGANIZATION> treated group compared with the Lop<ORGANIZATION> + Vehicle<PERSON> treated group. Also, above activity of epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells were regulated by the mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M2 and M3<GPE> ( mAChR M2<ORGANIZATION> and M3 ) and some mediators of their downstream signalling pathway. Finally, laxative effects of QCT<ORGANIZATION> on mAChR<ORGANIZATION> signalling pathway were significantly inhibited by the treatment of mAChR<ORGANIZATION> antagonist in primary smooth muscle of rat intestine cells ( pRISMCs<ORGANIZATION> ). This study provides the first strong evidence that QCT<ORGANIZATION> can be considered an important candidate for improving chronic constipation induced by Lop<PERSON> treatment in animal models.
