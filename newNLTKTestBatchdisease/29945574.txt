 The theoretical benefits of a mobile bearing design in Total Knee Arthroplasty<ORGANIZATION> ( TKA<ORGANIZATION> ) include increased articular surface conformity with a reduction in both polyethylene wear and implant interface shear. However, to date these theoretical advantages have not been translated into published evidence of superior survivorship. This paper presents the results of a prospective, non-comparative study evaluating the performance of the mobile bearing Low Contact Stress<PERSON> LCS Complete Rotating Platform TKA in a largely cementless cohort without patellar resurfacing. 237 consecutive patients ( 240 knees ) undergoing primary TKA were prospectively recruited. All received the LCS Complete<ORGANIZATION> Rotating Platform TKA ( DePuy International<ORGANIZATION>, Leeds<PERSON>, UK<ORGANIZATION> ). Clinical<PERSON> and radiographic assessments were performed at 3, 12, 60 and 120 months post-operatively. Radiographic evaluation was performed by an independent external surgeon. The mean age was 70.3 years. 77.5 % of cases were cementless. Radiographic assessment suggested excellent femoral component fixation. 22 tibial radiolucent lines ( RLLs<ORGANIZATION> ) > 1 mm were observed in 12 knees. No RLLs were progressive. There have been two revisions ; one for late infection and one for aseptic loosening. No patients underwent secondary patellar resurfacing. The cumulative implant survivorship, using component revision for any reason as the endpoint, was 98.9 % ( 95 % CI, 95.6 to 99.7 % ) at 10 years. The excellent survivorship at a minimum 10-year follow-up supports the use of uncemented porous coated fixation without patellar resurfacing with the non-posterior stabilized LCS Complete<ORGANIZATION> Rotating Platform TKA.
