 Intracellular calcium overload is known to be a precipitating factor of pancreatic cell injury in acute pancreatitis ( AP<ORGANIZATION> ). Intracellular calcium homeostasis depends of Plasmatic Membrane Calcium<ORGANIZATION> ATPase ( PMCA<ORGANIZATION> ), Sarcoplasmic Endothelial Reticulum Calcium<PERSON> ATPase 2 ( SERCA<ORGANIZATION> 2 ) and the Sodium Calcium Exchanger<ORGANIZATION> ( NCX1<ORGANIZATION> ). The antioxidant melatonin ( Mel ) and Trisulfate Disaccharide<ORGANIZATION> ( TD ) that accelerates NCX1<ORGANIZATION> action could reduce the cell damage determined by the AP<ORGANIZATION>. To evaluate m-RNA expressions of SERCA2<ORGANIZATION> and NCX1<ORGANIZATION> in acute pancreatitis induced by sodium taurocholate in Wistar<GPE> rats pre-treated with melatonin and/or TD. Wistar<ORGANIZATION> rats were divided in groups: 1 ) without AP<ORGANIZATION> ; 2 ) AP<ORGANIZATION> without pre-treatment ; 3 ) AP<ORGANIZATION> and Melatonin<GPE> ; 4 ) AP<ORGANIZATION> and TD<ORGANIZATION> ; 5 ) AP<ORGANIZATION> and Melatonin<PERSON> associated to TD. Pancreatic<PERSON> tissue samples were collected for detection of SERCA2<ORGANIZATION> and NCX1<ORGANIZATION> m-R NA levels by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR<ORGANIZATION> ). Increased m-RNA expression of SERCA2<ORGANIZATION> in the melatonin treated group, without increase of m-RNA expression of the NCX1<ORGANIZATION>. The TD<ORGANIZATION> did not affect levels of SERCA2<ORGANIZATION> and NCX1<ORGANIZATION> m-RNA expressions. The combined melatonin and TD<ORGANIZATION> treatment reduced the m-RNA expression of SERCA2<GPE>. The effect of melatonin is restricted to increased m-RNA expression of SERCA2<GPE>. Although TD<ORGANIZATION> does not affect gene expression, its action in accelerating calcium exchanger function can explain the slightest expression of SERCA2<GPE> m-RNA when associated with Melatonin<PERSON>, perhaps by a joint action of drugs with different and but possibly complementary mechanisms.
