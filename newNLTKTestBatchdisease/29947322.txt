 Lifestyle interventions remain the cornerstone therapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ). This randomised controlled single-blind clinical trial investigated the effect of Mediterranean<ORGANIZATION> diet ( MD ) or Mediterranean<GPE> lifestyle, along with weight loss, in NAFLD<GPE> patients. In all, sixty-three overweight/obese patients ( 50 ( sd 11 ) years, BMI=31·8 ( sd 4·5 ) kg/m2, 68 % men ) with ultrasonography-proven NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ( and elevated alanine aminotransferase ( ALT<ORGANIZATION> ) and/or γ-glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT<ORGANIZATION> ) levels ) were randomised to the following groups: ( A ) control group ( CG ), ( B ) Mediterranean<GPE> diet group ( MDG<ORGANIZATION> ) or ( C ) Mediterranean<GPE> lifestyle group ( MLG<ORGANIZATION> ). Participants of MDG<ORGANIZATION> and MLG<ORGANIZATION> attended seven 60-min group sessions for 6 months, aiming at weight loss and increasing adherence to MD. In the MLG<ORGANIZATION>, additional guidance for increasing physical activity and improving sleep habits were given. Patients in CG received only written information for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of 6 months, 88·8 % of participants completed the study. On the basis of intention-to-treat analysis, both MDG<ORGANIZATION> and MLG<ORGANIZATION> showed greater weight reduction and higher adherence to MD compared with the CG<ORGANIZATION> ( all P < 0·05 ) at the end of intervention. In addition, MLG<ORGANIZATION> increased vigorous exercise compared with the other two study groups ( P<PERSON> < 0·001 ) and mid-day rest/naps compared with CG<ORGANIZATION> ( P=0·04 ). MLG<ORGANIZATION> showed significant improvements in ALT<ORGANIZATION> levels ( i.e. ALT<ORGANIZATION> < 40 U/l ( P=0·03 ) and 50 % reduction of ALT<ORGANIZATION> levels ( P=0·009 ) ) and liver stiffness ( P=0·004 ) compared with CG<ORGANIZATION> after adjusting for % weight loss and baseline values. MDG<ORGANIZATION> improved only liver stiffness compared with CG<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < 0·001 ) after adjusting for the aforementioned variables. Small changes towards the Mediterranean<GPE> lifestyle, along with weight loss, can be a treatment option for patients with NAFLD<ORGANIZATION>.
