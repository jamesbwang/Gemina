 Appropriate<GPE> algorithms for the prediction of cardiovascular risk are strongly suggested in clinical practice, although still controversial. In type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM<ORGANIZATION> ), the beneficial effect of phosphodiesterase ( PDE<ORGANIZATION> ) -5 inhibitors is demonstrated on endothelial function but not on the estimation of cardiovascular risk. To study whether the chronic Vardenafil administration to men with T2DM<ORGANIZATION> influences variables correlated with the predicted long-term cardiovascular risk calculated by different validated algorithms. Per-protocol analysis of a longitudinal, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, investigator-started, clinical trial. 54 male patients affected by T2DM<ORGANIZATION> were assigned to study ( 26patients ) and control-group ( 28patients ), respectively. The study included a treatment phase ( 24weeks ) ( Vardenafil/placebo 10mg twice-daily ) and a follow-up phase ( 24weeks ). Three time points were considered: baseline ( V0 ), end of treatment ( V1 ) and end of the study ( V2 ). Parameters<ORGANIZATION> evaluated: endothelial health-related parameters and cardiovascular risk, assessed by calculating the Framingham<GPE> ( coronary hart disease [ CHD ], myocardial infarction [ MI ], stroke and cardiovascular disease [ CVD ] ), ASSIGN<ORGANIZATION> and CUORE<ORGANIZATION> equations. Predicted cardiovascular risk at ten years resulted different using the three algorithms chosen, without differences between study and control groups and among visits. IL-6 was directly related to CHD<ORGANIZATION>, CVD<ORGANIZATION> and CUORE<ORGANIZATION> scores at V1<ORGANIZATION> and with MI<ORGANIZATION> and STROKE<ORGANIZATION> at V2<ORGANIZATION>. Similarly, hs-CRP was directly related to CHD<ORGANIZATION>, MI<ORGANIZATION>, STROKE<ORGANIZATION> and CUORE<ORGANIZATION> only at V1 in the study group. Testosterone serum levels were inversely related to CHD<ORGANIZATION> and MI at V1 in study group. The predicted cardiovascular risk is different depending on the algorithm chosen. Despite no predictive risk reduction after six months of treatment, a possible effect of Vardenafil<ORGANIZATION> could be hypothesized through its action on inflammation markers reduction and through restoration of normal testosterone levels.
