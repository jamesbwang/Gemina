 Muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC<ORGANIZATION> ) is an aggressive disease for which treatment strategies are continuously evolving. We characterized trends in treatment modalities for MIBC<ORGANIZATION> from 2004 to 2013 ( the `` pre-immunotherapy era '' ) and identified predictors of receiving the current standard of care treatment: neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC<ORGANIZATION> ) followed by radical cystectomy ( RC ). We used the National Cancer Database<ORGANIZATION> to identify individuals diagnosed with clinically localized MIBC<ORGANIZATION> from 2004 to 2013. We calculated the yearly prevalence of NAC<ORGANIZATION> followed by RC<ORGANIZATION>, RC<ORGANIZATION> as first treatment, trimodal therapy, chemotherapy and/or radiation alone, and no treatment. We then identified factors associated with receiving NAC<ORGANIZATION> prior to RC. There was a notable increase in the use of NAC<ORGANIZATION> followed by RC<ORGANIZATION> over the study period, from 3.68 % in 2004 to 14.83 % in 2013 ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). Factors<PERSON> associated with decreased odds of receiving this regimen included being older, Black<PERSON>, uninsured, less educated, and more burdened by comorbidities. Rates of trimodal therapy and chemotherapy and/or radiation alone remained relatively constant ( approximately 5 and 17 %, respectively ). There was a consistent decline in the proportion of patients who did not receive any treatment, down to 34.20 % in 2013. Trends in localized MIBC<ORGANIZATION> treatment have evolved substantially since the early 2000s, and certain patient characteristics are associated with lower odds of receiving the current standard of care. This serves as a foundation from which to judge the impact of the upcoming immunotherapy era on the treatment landscape for this disease.
