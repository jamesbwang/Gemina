 In this paper, classic preparations in Treatise<GPE> on Febrile Diseases<ORGANIZATION> were systematically investigated to obtain their process parameters, and provide literature evidence and technical support for drug research and development. This paper includes the following sections: drug dose, solvents, excipients, and process parameters of classic preparations. The drug dose in Treatise<GPE> on Febrile Diseases<PERSON> was not consistent with that in Pharmacopoeia<GPE> of the People<ORGANIZATION> 's Republic<ORGANIZATION> of China<GPE> 2015, for example, `` Yi-Liang '' was about 15.625 g, and `` Yi-Sheng '' was about 200 mL. The solvents of classic preparations can be divided into two types: wine and water. There were eight kinds of water: water, `` Dongliu water '' `` Ganlan<PERSON> water '' `` acid pulp '' `` Jinghua water '' `` Lao water '' `` Mafei Tang '' `` spring water ''. There four kinds of wines: `` wine '' `` Bai wine '' `` Qing wine '' `` Ku wine ''. There were two kinds of excipients: rice and honey. Classic<PERSON> prescription powder had two kinds of processes: `` whole prescription powder '' and `` Yidaoshai Hezhizhi<PERSON> powder ''. Classic<PERSON> prescription pills had three kinds of processes: direct whole prescription pilling, pilling after extraction, and pilling with excipients after smashing. Classic<PERSON> prescription decoction had six kinds of processes: `` wine Tang<PERSON> '', `` Mafei Tang '', `` Jingmi Tang<PERSON> '', `` Mijian Tang<PERSON> '', `` water Tang<PERSON> '' `` Zhugao Tang<PERSON> ''. Drug<PERSON> dose, solvents, excipients, processes and other key parameters of classic preparations were systemically reviewed in this study, and the process parameters were clarified to provide literature evidence and technical support for drug development.
