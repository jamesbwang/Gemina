 Men who have sex with men ( MSM<ORGANIZATION> ) are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections ( STIs<ORGANIZATION> ). National guidelines recommend that MSM<ORGANIZATION> receive HIV<ORGANIZATION>, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia screening at least annually, and hepatitis A and B and human papillomavirus vaccinations. We investigated associations between disclosure of male-male sexual orientation/behavior and receipt of this panel of services. Gay<PERSON>, bisexual and other MSM<ORGANIZATION> aged 18-26 years were enrolled from health clinics serving lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities in Los Angeles<GPE> and Chicago<GPE> during 2012-2014. Participants<PERSON> completed a computer-assisted self-interview regarding healthcare services, disclosure of sexual orientation/behavior, and recent HIV test results. Proportions receiving recommended care, prevalence ratios ( PRs<ORGANIZATION> ), and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs<ORGANIZATION> ) were calculated using SAS<ORGANIZATION> 9.4. Overall, 817 participants visited a provider within the past year. Of these, 525 ( 64.3 % ) had disclosed, and 749 ( 91.7 % ) felt they could disclose if important to health. In total, 548 ( 67.1 % ) received all STI screenings, 74 ( 9.1 % ) received all vaccinations. Only 105 ( 12.9 % ) received any HPV vaccination. More disclosing participants received all recommended screenings ( aPR:1.4, CI:1.3-1.6 ) and all recommended care components ( aPR:2.2, CI:1.4-4.3 ) than non-disclosing participants. Despite national recommendations, receipt of a complete panel of STI<ORGANIZATION> care services was low among young MSM<ORGANIZATION>. Vaccine<PERSON> uptake was lower than STI<ORGANIZATION> screening. However, most participants visited a healthcare provider in the past year and most disclosed, suggesting opportunities to improve services. Providers might encourage disclosure by improving sexual history-taking and education, which could increase opportunities for MSM<ORGANIZATION> to receive recommended care.
