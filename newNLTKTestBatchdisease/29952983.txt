 The ancient infectious diseases, Lemierre<PERSON> 's Syndrome<ORGANIZATION> and Bezold<PERSON> 's Abscesses are rare. A 70-year-old Japanese<GPE> woman with a 15-year history of Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease was referred to our hospital due to fever, occipital headache and bilateral shoulder pain that had continued for three months. She had been prescribed prednisolone due to a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. A blood culture revealed bacteremia of Streptococcus<GPE> constellatus. In addition, computed tomography revealed Bezold<PERSON> 's abscesses and Lemierre<PERSON> 's syndrome. We administered ceftriaxone for 31 days, followed by oral amoxicillin. The patient recovered and the abscesses improved. This case underscores the importance of blood culture tests and cross-referencing with radiological imagings in the diagnoses of these rare critical infectious diseases that mimic polymyalgia rheumatica.
