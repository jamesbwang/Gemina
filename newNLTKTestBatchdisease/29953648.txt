 Previous studies have demonstrated that the recombinant Schistosoma japonicum protein P40 ( rSjP40<ORGANIZATION> ) could inhibit activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) through the TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway. Since multiple microRNAs<ORGANIZATION> could play essential roles in HSC<ORGANIZATION> activation and in the process of hepatic fibrosis through targeting Smads<PERSON>, we attempted to seek the potential microRNAs<ORGANIZATION> that could be involved in rSjP40-induced inhibition of HSC<ORGANIZATION> activation. Using the method of quantitative real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION>, we found that rSjP40<ORGANIZATION> could induce miR-146a expression in LX-2 cells. The down-regulated expression levels of Smad4<GPE> and α-SMA in LX-2 cells induced by rSjP40<ORGANIZATION> were partially restored by an miR-146a inhibitor. miR-146a can be involved in rSjP40-induced inhibition of HSC<ORGANIZATION> activation through targeting Smad4<PERSON>. These findings provide us a new idea to explore the potential mechanisms by which rSjP40<ORGANIZATION> could regulate the process of hepatic fibrosis.
