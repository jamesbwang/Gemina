 Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement ( TMVR<ORGANIZATION> ) is currently under clinical investigation as a viable treatment option for mitral regurgitation ( MR ). Therefore, it is important to outline the key functional requirements of a TMVR<ORGANIZATION> prosthesis in order to provide an overall approach to assessing mitral valve replacement devices utilizing a combination of in vitro and preclinical methods. This article provides a review of the mitral valve disease as well as general considerations and guidance for developing a TMVR<ORGANIZATION> device based on International Industry<ORGANIZATION> Standards. Specific details pertaining to the mitral valve apparatus, morphology of mitral valve disease, assessment of specific patient population as well as hazard analysis to evaluate and develop a TMVR<ORGANIZATION> device to treat a specific patient population have been included. The details contained within this report are not all inclusive or explicate for every technology being developed but rather thought of as a general guide on how a TMVR<ORGANIZATION> technology could be developed in alignment with International Industry<ORGANIZATION> Standards. Key learnings from the Transcatheter Aortic Valve<ORGANIZATION> Replacement ( TAVR<ORGANIZATION> ) experience has also been considered and taken into account when outlining this general guidance for TMVR<ORGANIZATION>. Key learning points from the TAVR<ORGANIZATION> development experience included the following: quantification of acceptable levels of paravalvular leak, valve migration potential using various anchoring methods and overall implant frame failure modes when treating the native aortic valve. It should be noted that TAVR<ORGANIZATION> is over a decade further along in development and clinical experience compared to TMVR<ORGANIZATION>. These key learnings from the early experience with TAVR<ORGANIZATION> should be considered with all transcatheter development projects.
