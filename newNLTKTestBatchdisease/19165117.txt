 C-reactive protein ( CRP<ORGANIZATION> ) is a member of the pentraxin superfamily that is widely recognized as a marker of inflammatory reactions and cardiovascular risk in humans. Recently, a growing body of data is emerging, which demonstrates that CRP<ORGANIZATION> is not only a marker of inflammation but also acts as a direct mediator of inflammatory reactions and the innate immune response. Here, we critically review the various lines of evidence supporting the concept of a pro-inflammatory `` CRP<ORGANIZATION> system. '' The CRP<ORGANIZATION> system consists of a functionally inert circulating pentameric form ( pCRP<ORGANIZATION> ), which is transformed to its highly pro-inflammatory structural isoforms, pCRP* and ultimately to monomeric CRP<ORGANIZATION> ( mCRP<ORGANIZATION> ). While retaining an overall pentameric structure, pCRP* is structurally more relaxed than pCRP<ORGANIZATION>, thus exposing neoepitopes important for immune activation and complement fixation. Thereby, pCRP* shares its pro-inflammatory properties with the fully dissociated structural isoform mCRP<ORGANIZATION>. The dissociation of pCRP<ORGANIZATION> into its pro-inflammatory structural isoforms and thus activation of the CRP<ORGANIZATION> system occur on necrotic, apoptotic, and ischemic cells, regular β-sheet structures such as β-amyloid, the membranes of activated cells ( e.g., platelets, monocytes, and endothelial cells ), and/or the surface of microparticles, the latter by binding to phosphocholine. Both pCRP* and mCRP<ORGANIZATION> can cause activation of platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, and complement. The localization and deposition of these pro-inflammatory structural isoforms of CRP<ORGANIZATION> in inflamed tissue appear to be important mediators for a range of clinical conditions, including ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) injury of various organs, cardiovascular disease, transplant rejection, Alzheimer<PERSON> 's disease, and age-related macular degeneration. These findings provide the impetus to tackle the vexing problem of innate immunity response by targeting CRP<ORGANIZATION>. Understanding the `` activation process '' of CRP<ORGANIZATION> will also likely allow the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs, thereby providing potential new immunomodulatory therapeutics in a broad range of inflammatory diseases.
