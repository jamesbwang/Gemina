 The activation of human pregnane X receptor ( PXR<ORGANIZATION> ) has potential therapeutic uses for inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD<ORGANIZATION> ). Imperatorin<GPE> ( IMP<ORGANIZATION> ), a naturally-occurring coumarin, is the main bioactive ingredient of Angelica<ORGANIZATION> dahurica Radix, which is regularly used to treat the common cold and intestinal disorders. However, there are no data on the protective effects of IMP<ORGANIZATION> against IBD<ORGANIZATION>. The effects of IMP<ORGANIZATION> on PXR-modulated cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4<ORGANIZATION> ) expression were assessed using a PXR<ORGANIZATION> transactivation assay, a mammalian two-hybrid assay, a competitive ligand-binding assay, analysis of CYP3A4<ORGANIZATION> mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein expression levels, and measurement of CYP3A4<ORGANIZATION> activity using a cell-based reporter gene assay and in vitro model. The inhibitory effects of IMP<ORGANIZATION> on NF-κB activity was evaluated by a reporter assay and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. The anti-IBD effects of IMP<ORGANIZATION> were investigated in a dextran sulphate sodium ( DSS<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced colitis mouse model. Colon<PERSON> inflammatory cytokines were assessed by ELISA<ORGANIZATION>. IMP<ORGANIZATION> activated CYP3A4<ORGANIZATION> promoter activity, recruited steroid receptor coactivator 1 ( SRC-1 ) to the ligand-binding domain of PXR<ORGANIZATION>, and increased the expression and activity of CYP3A4<ORGANIZATION>. However, PXR<ORGANIZATION> knockdown substantially reduced PXR-mediated CYP3A4<ORGANIZATION> expression. Furthermore, IMP-mediated PXR<ORGANIZATION> activation suppressed NF-κB nuclear translocation and downregulated lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory gene expression. Nevertheless, PXR<ORGANIZATION> knockdown partially reduced the IMP-mediated inhibition of NF-κB. IMP<ORGANIZATION> ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by PXR/NF-κB signalling. IMP<ORGANIZATION> serves as a PXR<ORGANIZATION> agonist to attenuate DSS-induced colitis by the suppression of the NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory response in a PXR/NF-κB- dependent manner.
