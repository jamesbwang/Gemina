 Dengue<GPE> fever is a major international public health concern, with more than 55 % of the world population at risk of infection. Recent climate changes related to global warming have increased the potential risk of domestic outbreaks of dengue in Korea<GPE>. In this study, we develop a two-strain dengue model associated with climate-dependent parameters based on Representative Concentration Pathway ( RCP<ORGANIZATION> ) scenarios provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration<ORGANIZATION>. We assess the potential risks of dengue outbreaks by means of the vector capacity and intensity under various RCP<ORGANIZATION> scenarios. A sensitivity analysis of the temperature-dependent parameters is performed to explore the effects of climate change on dengue transmission dynamics. Our results demonstrate that a higher temperature significantly enhances the potential threat of domestic dengue outbreaks in Korea<GPE>. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of countermeasures on the cumulative incidence of humans and vectors. The current main control measures ( comprising only travel restrictions ) for infected humans in Korea<GPE> are not as effective as combined control measures ( travel restrictions and vector control ), dramatically reducing the possibilities of dengue outbreaks.
