 Acute<GPE> rejection is a major cause of graft loss in patients with kidney transplantations. However, the appropriate timing for performing a biopsy is often difficult to gauge in a clinical settings. We encountered an 8-year-old boy in whom antibody mediated rejection ( AMR<ORGANIZATION> ) associated with de novo donor-specific antibody ( DSA<ORGANIZATION> ) developed shortly after an episode of type IA acute cellular rejection ( ACR<ORGANIZATION> ). He had received a preemptive ABO-compatible kidney transplantation due to bilateral renal hypoplasia. Type IA ACR<PERSON> developed 2 months after transplantation and was successfully treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy ( MPT<ORGANIZATION> ) and gusperimus hydrochloride. However, 4 months after transplantation, his serum creatinine level increased again. We decided to perform an additional biopsy despite having done the previous biopsy only a short time ago. Marked<PERSON> infiltration of inflammation cells in the peritubular capillaries ( PTCs<ORGANIZATION> ) with positive C4d<ORGANIZATION> staining was observed. AMR<ORGANIZATION> associated with de novo DSA with type IB ACR was newly diagnosed because DSA<ORGANIZATION> was not detected and the crossmatch test was negative before transplantation. He immediately received two courses of plasma exchange ( PE ), three courses of MPT<ORGANIZATION>, and rituximab. He confessed to non-adherence and underwent a patient education program with his family again. To date, no cases of AMR<ORGANIZATION> associated with de novo DSA shortly after ACR<ORGANIZATION> have been reported. Our experience lends support to the 'episode biopsy ' method in which a biopsy is performed for each episode of serum creatinine increase as recommended by The Kidney<ORGANIZATION> Disease: Improving Global Outcomes<PERSON> ( KDIGO<ORGANIZATION> ) Transplant<ORGANIZATION> Working Group.
