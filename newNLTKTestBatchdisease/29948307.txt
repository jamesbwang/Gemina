 Alport<GPE> syndrome is a rare hereditary kidney disease manifested with progressive renal failure. Considerable variation exists in terms of disease progression among patients with Alport<PERSON> syndrome. Identification of patients at high risk of rapid progression remains an unmet need. Urinary epidermal growth factor ( uEGF<ORGANIZATION> ) has been shown to be independently associated with risk of progression to adverse kidney outcome in multiple independent adult chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ) cohorts. In this study, we aim to assess if uEGF<ORGANIZATION> is associated with kidney impairment and its prognostic value for children with Alport<PERSON> syndrome. One hundred and seventeen pediatric patients with Alport<PERSON> syndrome and 146 healthy children ( 3-18 years old ) were included in this study. uEGF<ORGANIZATION> was measured in duplicates in baseline urine samples using ELISA<ORGANIZATION> ( R<ORGANIZATION> & D ) and concentration was normalized by urine creatinine ( uEGF/Cr ). In patients with longitudinal follow-up data ( n = 38 ), progression was defined as deteriorated kidney function ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> stage increase ) during follow-up period ( follow-up length is about 31 months in average ). The association of baseline uEGF/Cr level with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) slope and Alport<PERSON> syndrome patients ' progression to a more advanced CKD<ORGANIZATION> stage during the follow-up period was used to evaluate the prognostic value of the marker. We found that uEGF/creatinine ( uEGF/Cr ) decreases with age in pediatric patients with Alport<PERSON> syndrome with a significantly faster rate than in healthy children of the same age group. uEGF/Cr is significantly correlated with eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ( r = 0.75, p < 0.001 ), after adjustment for age. In 38 patients with longitudinal follow-up, we observed a significant correlation between uEGF/Cr and eGFR<ORGANIZATION> slope ( r = 0.58, p < 0.001 ). Patients with lower uEGF/Cr level were at increased risk of progression to a higher CKD<ORGANIZATION> stage. uEGF/Cr was able to distinguish progressors from non-progressors with an AUC<ORGANIZATION> of 0.88, versus 0.77 by eGFR<ORGANIZATION> and 0.81 by 24-h urinary protein ( 24-h UP ). Our study suggests that uEGF/Cr is a promising biomarker for accelerated kidney function decline in pediatric patients with Alport<PERSON> syndrome. It may help to identify patients at high risk of progression for targeted clinical care and improve the patients ' stratification in interventional trials.
