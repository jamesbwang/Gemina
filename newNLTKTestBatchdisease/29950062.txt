 There are 400 thousand patients with long-term hemodialysis in China<GPE> nowadays. Hemodialysis<PERSON>, as the most common alternative to renal replacement therapy, prolongs the life span of patients with end stage renal failure. However, there are still many complications of hemodialysis treatment. These complications reduce the quality of life of patients and may even endanger their life, and sometimes they are difficult to deal with. Classical prescriptions, commonly referred to as classical effective prescriptions in modern medicine, mainly indicating the formulas recorded in Treatise<GPE> on Febrile Diseases and Synopsis<ORGANIZATION> of Golden<ORGANIZATION> Chamber, were relative to contemporary prescriptions emerging after Song<GPE> and Yuan<ORGANIZATION> dynasties. Prescriptions corresponding to syndromes means one-to-one correspondence between syndromes and prescriptions, with many advantages and that is the key of clinical efficacy. Many complications of hemodialysis patients have typical clinical manifestations, which can match the syndromes corresponding to classical prescriptions, thus quickly relieving the symptoms of patients in clinical application. Six clinical cases of dialysis muscle spasm, disequilibrium syndrome, restless legs syndrome, uremic encephalopathy, post dialysis arrhythmia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism were used in this paper, to explore the intervention strategies for hemodialysis related complications.
