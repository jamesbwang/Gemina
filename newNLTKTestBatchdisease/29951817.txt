 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT<ORGANIZATION> ) was initially described in 1886. It is characterized by defects in the peripheral nervous system, including sensory and motor neurons. Although more than 80 CMT-causing genes have been identified to date, an effective therapy has not yet been developed for this disease. Since Drosophila<PERSON> does not have axons surrounded by myelin sheaths or Schwann<ORGANIZATION> cells, the establishment of a demyelinating CMT<ORGANIZATION> model is not appropriate. In this chapter, after overviewing CMT<ORGANIZATION>, examples of Drosophila<ORGANIZATION> CMT models with axonal neuropathy and other animal CMT<ORGANIZATION> models are described.
