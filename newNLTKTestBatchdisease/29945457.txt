 Animal<GPE> and human laboratory studies suggest that the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms ( AAAs<ORGANIZATION> ) involves inflammation and degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. This study prospectively assessed the association between biomarkers for these mechanisms and the presence of AAA<ORGANIZATION> during 24 years of follow-up in the Atherosclerosis Risk<ORGANIZATION> in Communities<GPE> ( ARIC<ORGANIZATION> ) study. The ARIC<ORGANIZATION> prospectively identified clinically diagnosed AAAs<ORGANIZATION> in 15 792 men and women from baseline in 1987 to 1989 to 2011 using hospital discharge codes and death records. Additional asymptomatic AAAs<ORGANIZATION> were detected by an abdominal ultrasound scan in 2011 to 2013. Matrix<PERSON> metalloproteinase ( MMP<ORGANIZATION> ) -3, MMP-9, interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ), N-terminal propeptide of Type III<PERSON> procollagen ( PIIINP<ORGANIZATION> ), and osteopontin were measured in blood samples collected between 1987 and 1992 in participants with AAA<ORGANIZATION> ( 544 clinically diagnosed AAAs<ORGANIZATION> and 72 ultrasound-detected AAAs ) and a random sample of 723 participants selected from baseline and matched with AAAs<ORGANIZATION> by age, race and sex. Higher concentrations of MMP-9 and IL-6 were associated with future risk of clinically diagnosed AAA<ORGANIZATION> ( hazard ratios [ 95 % confidence intervals ]: 1.55 [ 1.22-1.97 ] and 1.87 [ 1.48-2.35 ], respectively, comparing highest versus lowest tertiles ) after multivariable adjustment ( P for trend < .001 ). Matrix<PERSON> metalloproteinase-9 was also associated with ultrasound-detected AAA<ORGANIZATION>. In conclusion, blood concentrations of MMP-9 and IL-6 measured in middle age predicted the risk of AAA<ORGANIZATION> during 24 years of follow-up.
