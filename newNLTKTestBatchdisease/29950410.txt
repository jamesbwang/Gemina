 Under the immune pressure of cytotoxic T-cells ( CTLs<ORGANIZATION> ), Hepatitis B<PERSON> virus ( HBV<ORGANIZATION> ) evolves to accumulate mutations more likely within epitopes to evade immune detection. However, little is known about the specific patterns of the immune pressure-associated HBV<ORGANIZATION> mutation of T-cell epitopes and their linking to the disease progression. Here, we observed a correlation of the accumulated variants on HBV<ORGANIZATION> core protein ( HBc<ORGANIZATION> ) with the disease severity of HBV<ORGANIZATION> infection. Further analysis indicated that these substitutions majorly located within CD8<ORGANIZATION>
