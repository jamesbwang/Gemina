 Culicoides biting midges ( Diptera: Ceratopogonidae ) are vectors of a range of orbiviruses that cause important veterinary diseases such as bluetongue and African<GPE> horse sickness. The effective monitoring of Culicoides<GPE> species diversity and abundance, both at livestock and near potential wildlife hosts, is essential for risk management. The Onderstepoort<ORGANIZATION> 220-V ultraviolet ( UV ) light trap is extensively used for this purpose. Reducing its power requirements by fitting low-energy light-emitting diodes ( LEDs<ORGANIZATION> ) can lead to greater flexibility in monitoring. A comparison of the efficiency of the 220-V Onderstepoort trap ( 8-W fluorescent UV light ) with the efficiency of the 220-V or 12-V Onderstepoort traps fitted with red, white, blue or green LEDs<ORGANIZATION> or a 12-V fluorescent Onderstepoort trap demonstrated the 220-V Onderstepoort trap to be the most efficient. All the results showed nulliparous Culicoides imicola Kieffer<PERSON> females to be the dominant grouping. Despite the lower numbers collected, 12-V traps can be used in field situations to determine the most abundant species.
