 To investigate the toxicity changes of Euphorbiae Ebracteolatae Radix<ORGANIZATION> ( EER<ORGANIZATION> ) before and after vinegar processing, toxic diterpenoids were concentrated with chloroform as extraction solvent from EER<ORGANIZATION>. Then the residue was extracted for non-chloroform extract with 95 % ethanol and water after extraction with chloroform. The chloroform extraction of vinegar processed EER<ORGANIZATION> was prepared with the same method. The mice received the drug by oral administration. Moisture<PERSON> content in mice feces, duodenum and colon tissue, aquaporin AQP1<ORGANIZATION>, AQP3<ORGANIZATION>, AQP4<ORGANIZATION> protein expression levels were assayed as the indexes to investigate the toxicity variation of chloroform fraction, non-chloroform fraction, as well as intestinal tract toxicity before and after vinegar processing of EER<ORGANIZATION>. The results showed that the chloroform fraction extracted from EER<ORGANIZATION> could significantly increase the moisture content in mice feces, duodenum and colon, and decrease AQP1<ORGANIZATION> protein expression level, increase AQP3<ORGANIZATION> and AQP4<ORGANIZATION> protein expression levels in the colon. The intestinal toxicity of the chloroform extract was significantly higher than that of non-chloroform extract. The moisture content in mice feces, duodenum and colon was significantly decreased, and the AQPs<ORGANIZATION> protein expression tended to be normal in the colon after vinegar processing. The results showed that the chloroform fraction extracted from EER<ORGANIZATION> could lead to diarrhea, intestinal edema, and the intestinal toxicity action was associated with interfering AQPs<ORGANIZATION> protein expression and promoting intestinal fluid transport disorder in mice. Vinegar-processing could reduce intestinal toxicity of EER<ORGANIZATION>, so vinegar processing was considered to be the scientific processing method of EER<ORGANIZATION>.
