 Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) greatly reduces the risk of HIV<ORGANIZATION> acquisition, but its optimal delivery strategy remains uncertain. Clinics<PERSON> for sexually transmitted infections ( STIs<ORGANIZATION> ) can provide an efficient venue for PrEP delivery. To quantify the added value of STI<ORGANIZATION> clinic-based PrEP delivery, we used an agent-based simulation of HIV<ORGANIZATION> transmission among men who have sex with men ( MSM<ORGANIZATION> ). We simulated the impact of PrEP delivery through STI<ORGANIZATION> clinics compared with PrEP delivery in other community-based settings. Our primary outcome was the projected twenty-year reduction in HIV incidence among MSM<ORGANIZATION>. Assuming PrEP uptake and adherence of 60 % each, evaluating STI<ORGANIZATION> clinic attendees and delivering PrEP to eligible MSM<ORGANIZATION> reduced HIV<ORGANIZATION> incidence by 16 % [ 95 % uncertainty range: 14 % - 18 % ] over 20 years, an impact that was 1.8 [ 1.7-2.0 ] times as great as that achieved by evaluating an equal number of MSM<ORGANIZATION> recruited from the community. Comparing strategies where an equal number of MSM<ORGANIZATION> received PrEP in each strategy ( i.e., evaluating more individuals for PrEP in the community-based strategy, since MSM<ORGANIZATION> attending STI<ORGANIZATION> clinics are more likely to be PrEP eligible ), the reduction in HIV incidence under the STI<ORGANIZATION> clinic-based strategy was 1.3 [ 1.3-1.4 ] times as great as that of community-based delivery. Delivering PrEP to MSM who attend STI<ORGANIZATION> clinics can improve efficiency and effectiveness. If high levels of adherence can be achieved in this population, STI<ORGANIZATION> clinics may be an important venue for PrEP implementation.
