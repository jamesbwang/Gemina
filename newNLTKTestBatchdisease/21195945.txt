 Allergic<GPE> rhinitis ( AR ) is a global health problem that causes major illnesses and disabilities worldwide. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of AR<ORGANIZATION> has increased progressively over the last few decades in more developed countries and currently affects up to 40 % of the population worldwide. Likewise<PERSON>, a rising trend of AR<ORGANIZATION> has also been observed over the last 2-3 decades in developing countries including China<GPE>, with the prevalence of AR varying widely in these countries. A survey of self-reported AR over a 6-year period in the general Chinese<GPE> adult population reported that the standardized prevalence of adult AR increased from 11.1 % in 2005 to 17.6 % in 2011. An increasing number of Journal Articles<ORGANIZATION> and imporclinical trials on the epidemiology, pathophysiologic mechanisms, diagnosis, management and comorbidities of AR in Chinese<GPE> subjects have been published in international peer-reviewed journals over the past 2 decades, and substantially added to our understanding of this disease as a global problem. Although guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AR in Chinese<GPE> subjects have also been published, they have not been translated into English<GPE> and therefore not generally accessible for reference to non-Chinese speaking international medical communities. Moreover, methods for the diagnosis and treatment of AR in China<GPE> have not been standardized entirely and some patients are still treated according to regional preferences. Thus, the present guidelines have been developed by the Chinese Society<ORGANIZATION> of Allergy<GPE> to be accessible to both national and international medical communities involved in the management of AR<ORGANIZATION> patients. These guidelines have been prepared in line with existing international guidelines to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AR in China<GPE>.
