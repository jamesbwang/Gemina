 Cupping is an ancient procedure that has been practiced for thousands of years. It has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions, including dermatological ones. Cupping has been described in the literature for the treatment of conditions such as acne and eczema. The procedure is fundamentally divided into dry cupping and wet cupping ; however, there have been many modern adaptations. Adverse events related to the procedure have been reported in the literature and should be considered by patients. However, cupping has a promising role in helping manage dermatological conditions.
