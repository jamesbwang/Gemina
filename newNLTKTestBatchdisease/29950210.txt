 To detect the serum levels of platelet microparticle ( PMP<ORGANIZATION> ), fibronectin ( FN ), and von Willebrand<ORGANIZATION> Factor ( vWF<ORGANIZATION> ) in acute leukemia ( AL<ORGANIZATION> ) patients with thrombocytopenic and to analyze the relationship of the serum levels of PMP<ORGANIZATION>, FN<ORGANIZATION> and vWF<ORGANIZATION> with bleeding degree. One hundred and one newly diagnosed AL<ORGANIZATION> patients from May 2014 to May 2017 were enrolled the AL<ORGANIZATION> group. According to the WHO<ORGANIZATION> standard of bleeding stratification, 101 AL patients were divided into 5 sub groups: 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 score groups ; 52 normal persons subjected to physical examination were enrolled in control group. The PMP<ORGANIZATION> level was detected by flow cytometry ; the FN<ORGANIZATION> and vWF<ORGANIZATION> levels were detected by ELISA<ORGANIZATION>. The levels of PMP<ORGANIZATION>, FN<ORGANIZATION> and vWF<ORGANIZATION> were compared between the AL<ORGANIZATION> group and the control group. The serum levels of PMP<ORGANIZATION>, FN<ORGANIZATION> and vWF<ORGANIZATION> were compared according to bleeding degree group. The relationship of bleeding degree with the serum levels of PMP<ORGANIZATION>, FN<ORGANIZATION> and vWF<ORGANIZATION> was analyzed. The patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia aged 18 to 60, and accounted for 61.39 %. The degree of bleeding was mainly 1 score, which accounted for 38.61 %. The serum levels of PMP<ORGANIZATION>, vWF<ORGANIZATION> and FN<ORGANIZATION> AL groups were significantly higher than those in control group ( 6.06 % ±4.38 % vs 0.89 % ±0.50 %, 205.82±24.89 vs 58.04±13.35 µg/L, 398.29±46.93 vs 311.37±26.02 µg/L ) ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). The serum levels of PMP<ORGANIZATION>, FN<ORGANIZATION> and vWF<ORGANIZATION> were different among 5 subgroup ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) ; the level of PMP<ORGANIZATION> and FN were the highest in 0 score group and the lowest in 4 score group ; the vWF<ORGANIZATION> level was the highest in 4 score groups and the lowest in 0 score group. The bleeding degree in the patients with acute leukemia negatively correlated with PMP<ORGANIZATION> level, and positively with NF<ORGANIZATION> and vWF<ORGANIZATION> levels ( r=-0.753, r=0.648, r=0.805 ). According to the relationship of the bleeding degree with serum levels of PMP<ORGANIZATION>, FN<ORGANIZATION>, vWF<ORGANIZATION> in patients, the detection of PMP<ORGANIZATION>, vWF<ORGANIZATION> and FN<ORGANIZATION> levels can help to evaluale the bleeding degree in the patients.
