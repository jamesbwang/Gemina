 To investigate the expression of LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> KCNQ1OT1 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ) and to analyze the relation of LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> KCNQ1OT1 expression levels with clinicopathological features. A total of 68 patients with AML<ORGANIZATION> were enrolled in the study, 48 out of them were suffered from acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ) and 20 reached to complete remission ( CR ), 30 age-matched patients with iron-deficient anemia were included in control group, the peripheral blood samples of all the patients were collected, and the real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR<ORGANIZATION> ( qRT-PCR ) was used to detect the expression of LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> KCNQ1OT1, meanwhile, the correlation of its expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis was analyzed. The expression of LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> KCNQ1OT1 in AML<ORGANIZATION> patients was significantly higher than that in the patient with complete remission and iron-deficient anemia ( F=14.67, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). The expression of LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> KCNQ1OT1 was not significantly different between 20 cases of AML-CR and 30 cases of iron-deficient anemia ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). The expression of LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> KCNQ1OT1 was associated with NCCN<ORGANIZATION> risk grade and survival status in patients with AML<ORGANIZATION>. The median overall survival time was significantly shorter in patients with high expression of LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> KCNQ1OT1 than that in patients with low expression ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> KCNQ1OT1 may be involved in the regulation of AML<ORGANIZATION>. Expression of LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> KCNQ1OT1 and NCCN<ORGANIZATION> risk score can be used as biomarkers of prognosis in the patients with AML<ORGANIZATION> and may be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for AML<ORGANIZATION> patients.
