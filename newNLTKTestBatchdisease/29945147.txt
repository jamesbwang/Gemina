 The association between diverticulitis and colorectal cancer ( CRC<ORGANIZATION> ) remains unclear, though both share epidemiological characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is higher risk for CRC<ORGANIZATION> after an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Furthermore, in cases of CRC<ORGANIZATION>, we sought to determine specific tumour characteristics. This retrospective observational study includes patients with acute diverticulitis ( Hinchey 0 and 1 ) who were conservatively treated with or without antibiotics between 2008 and 2013. Patients with endoscopic follow-up were included for analysis. Tumour characteristics of patients diagnosed with CRC<ORGANIZATION> during colonoscopic follow-up according to patients ' presentation of alarm symptoms were considered to be the primary endpoint. A total of 977 patients were conservatively treated for an episode of acute diverticulitis, 645 of whom underwent colonoscopy during follow-up. Ten patients were diagnosed with CRC<ORGANIZATION>, nine of whom exhibited alarm symptoms. One patient was diagnosed with stage I disease, 4 had stage II, and 5 had stage III<ORGANIZATION> disease. This study strongly suggests that even though CRC<ORGANIZATION> is rare after uncomplicated diverticulitis, in cases of alarm symptoms, a colonoscopy is indicated. In cases where CRC<ORGANIZATION> is diagnosed, it is often advanced with a higher TNM<ORGANIZATION> stage and poor prognosis.
