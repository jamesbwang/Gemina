 Arsenic<GPE> is one of the most widespread global environmental toxicants associated with endemic poisoning. ATP-binding cassette ( ABC<ORGANIZATION> ) proteins are transmembrane channels that transport and dispose of lipids and metabolic products across the plasma membrane. The majority of ABC<ORGANIZATION> family members ( including ABCB1<ORGANIZATION> and ABCC1<ORGANIZATION> ) are reported to play a role in the development of arsenic and drug resistance in mammals. Previously, we established a human arsenic-resistant ECV-304 ( AsRE<ORGANIZATION> ) cell line and identified ABCA1<ORGANIZATION> as a novel arsenic resistance gene. In the current study, we further investigated the potential contribution of ABCA1<ORGANIZATION>, ABCB1<ORGANIZATION>, and ABCC1<ORGANIZATION> to arsenic resistance through measurement of survival rates and arsenic accumulation in AsRE<ORGANIZATION> cells with RNA<ORGANIZATION> interference. The arsenic resistance capacity of ABCC1<ORGANIZATION> was the strongest among the three genes, while those of ABCA1<ORGANIZATION> and ABCB1<ORGANIZATION> were similar. Double or triple gene knockdown of ABCA1<ORGANIZATION>, ABCB1<ORGANIZATION>, and ABCC1<ORGANIZATION> via RNA<ORGANIZATION> interference led to a decrease significant in arsenic resistance when ABCA1/ABCB1 or ABCB1/ABCC1 were simultaneously silenced. Interestingly, no differences were evident between cells with ABCA1/ABCC1 and ABCC1<ORGANIZATION> only knockdown. Our findings suggest that ABCA1<ORGANIZATION> and ABCB1<ORGANIZATION> proteins display similar arsenic resistance capabilities and possibly coordinate to promote arsenic resistance in AsRE<ORGANIZATION> cells.
