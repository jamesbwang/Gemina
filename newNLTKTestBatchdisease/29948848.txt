 Eltrombopag<GPE> is a thrombopoietic growth factor that is approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. We aimed to describe eltrombopag population pharmacokinetics in hepatitis C patients. Bayesian<GPE> statistical approach will be applied to screen for patients ' characteristics associated with eltrombopag pharmacokinetic parameters. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using WinBUGS<ORGANIZATION> version 1.4.3. Data from 483 individuals with chronic HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection were analyzed. This analysis is a secondary analysis of two clinical studies ( ENABLE1<ORGANIZATION> and ENABLE2<ORGANIZATION> ) sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline<ORGANIZATION>. Several patients ' characteristics were examined as possible covariates of the population pharmacokinetic model. Prior information from previous studies was incorporated in the bayesian model as prior distribution to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption with exponential error model best fit the data. We identified East<GPE> Asian<GPE> race and total bilirubin level as predictors of eltrombopag clearance. Typical value for distributional clearance was 0.762 L/h ( 95 % Bayesian<GPE> credible set, 0.703-0.826 ), for volume of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments were 12 L ( 10.9-13.4 ) and 10.9 L ( 10.4-11.5 ), and for absorption lag time was 0.947 h ( 0.918-0.977 ). Assuming an average total bilirubin of 21.7 Âµmol/L, the typical elimination clearance value for an East<GPE> Asian<GPE> patient was 0.14 L/h and for other races was 0.20 L/h. Eltrombopag pharmacokinetic behavior was described using population bayesian approach. This model can be applied to optimize eltrombopag dosing in order to reduce the incidence of thrombocytopenia in HCV-infected patient receiving interferon-based therapy.
