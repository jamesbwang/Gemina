 Magnetoencephalography<GPE> ( MEG<ORGANIZATION> ) captures the magnetic fields generated by neuronal current sources with sensors outside the head. In MEG<ORGANIZATION> analysis these current sources are estimated from the measured data to identify the locations and time courses of neural activity. Since there is no unique solution to this so-called inverse problem, multiple source estimation techniques have been developed. The nulling beamformer ( NB ), a modified form of the linearly constrained minimum variance ( LCMV<ORGANIZATION> ) beamformer, is specifically used in the process of inferring interregional interactions and is designed to eliminate shared signal contributions, or cross-talk, between regions of interest ( ROIs<ORGANIZATION> ) that would otherwise interfere with the connectivity analyses. The nulling beamformer applies the truncated singular value decomposition ( TSVD<ORGANIZATION> ) to remove small signal contributions from a ROI<ORGANIZATION> to the sensor signals. However, ROIs<ORGANIZATION> with strong crosstalk will have high separating power in the weaker components, which may be removed by the TSVD<ORGANIZATION> operation. To address this issue we propose a new method, the
