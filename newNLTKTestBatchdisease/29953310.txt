 To compare the clinical characteristics of patients with active episodes of ocular toxoplasmosis from three provinces, Misiones<PERSON>, Santa Fe<PERSON>, and Buenos Aires<PERSON>, Argentina<GPE>. Patients with a diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis from three databases of four tertiary referral uveitis centers were reviewed. Collected data included presentation of the retinochoroiditis, location of the active lesions, associated inflammatory ocular signs and complications. Three hundred thirty-four patients were included in this study. Bilateral involvement of the ocular disease occurred in 26 patients in Misiones<GPE> ( 35.14 % ), 21 patients ( 12.8 % ) in Santa Fe<GPE>, and 9 patients in Buenos<GSP> Aires ( 9.4 % ) ( p < 0.001 ). Extensive retinitis was observed in 49 patients ( 66.2 % ) in Misiones<GPE>, 39 patients ( 23.8 % ) in Santa Fe<GPE>, and 12 patients ( 12.5 % ) in Buenos<GSP> Aires ( p < 0.001 ). The results indicate that there are differences in the clinical characteristics of ocular toxoplasmosis in patients from Misiones<GPE>, Santa Fe<PERSON>, and Buenos Aires<PERSON>.
