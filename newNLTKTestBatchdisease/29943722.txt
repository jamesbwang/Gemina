 Iron<GPE> deficiency ( ID ) and HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection frequently coexist. Little data exist on ID in HIV-infected individuals, partly because the iron marker ferritin is altered by inflammation common in HIV infection. We measured iron biomarkers ( ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor [ sTfR ], hepcidin ) and red cell indices ( hemoglobin, mean cell volume [ MCV ] ) in newly diagnosed, ART-naive, HIV-infected (
