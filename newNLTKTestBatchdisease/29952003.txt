 Geminin<GPE>, a DNA<ORGANIZATION> replication licensing inhibitor, ensures faithful DNA<ORGANIZATION> replication in vertebrates. Several studies have shown that Geminin<PERSON> depletion in vitro results in rereplication and DNA<ORGANIZATION> damage, while increased expression of Geminin<GPE> has been observed in human cancers. However, conditional inactivation of Geminin<GPE> during embryogenesis has not revealed any detectable DNA<ORGANIZATION> replication defects. In order to examine its role in vivo, we conditionally inactivated Geminin<PERSON> in the murine colon and lung and assessed chemically induced carcinogenesis. We show here that mice lacking Geminin<PERSON> develop a significantly higher number of tumors and bear a larger tumor burden compared to sham-treated controls, in urethane-induced lung and AOM/DSS-induced colon carcinogenesis. Survival is also significantly reduced in mice lacking Geminin<PERSON> during lung carcinogenesis. A significant increase in the total number and grade of lesions ( hyperplasias, adenomas and carcinomas ) was also confirmed by H & E. Moreover, increased genomic aberrations, identified by increased ATR<ORGANIZATION> and γH2AX<ORGANIZATION> expression, was detected through immunohistochemistry analysis. In addition, we further analyzed Geminin expression in human colon cancer and found increased expression, as well as positive correlation with ATM/ATR levels and a non-monotonic association with γH2AX<ORGANIZATION>. Taken<PERSON> together, our data demonstrate that Geminin<PERSON> acts as a tumor suppressor by safeguarding genome stability, while its overexpression is also associated with genomic instability.
