 Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a serious threat to immunocompromised and critical care patients. Recent detailed guidelines and treatment algorithms lead microbiologists and clinicians in diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Currently, there is no tool available that allows to measure guideline adherence. To develop such a tool, we reviewed current guidelines provided by 5 scientific societies ( European Society<ORGANIZATION> for Clinical Microbiology<PERSON> and Infectious Diseases<ORGANIZATION>, European<GPE> Confederation of Medical Mycology<ORGANIZATION>, European<GPE> Respiratory Society, Infectious Diseases Society<PERSON> of America<GPE> ( IDSA<ORGANIZATION> ), and Infectious Diseases<ORGANIZATION> Working Party of the German Society<ORGANIZATION> for Hematology<ORGANIZATION> and Medical Oncology<ORGANIZATION> ) and selected the strongest recommendations for management as key components for our scoring tool. We integrated diagnostic measures ( chest computed tomography, bronchoalveolar lavage with galactomannan, fungal culture, fungal polymerase chain reaction analysis, species identification, susceptibility testing, histology with silver stain, Periodic<PERSON> acid-Schiff staining, and molecular diagnostics ), treatment ( antifungal choice and therapeutic drug monitoring ), and follow-up computed tomography. The EQUAL Aspergillosis<ORGANIZATION> Score 2018 aggregates and weighs the components and provides a tool to support antifungal stewardship and to quantify guideline adherence.
