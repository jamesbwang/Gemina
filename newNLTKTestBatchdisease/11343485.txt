 Diseases affecting the brain contribute to a substantial proportion of morbidity and mortality in the general population. Conditions such as stroke, dementia and cognitive impairment have a prominent impact on global public health. Despite the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of these conditions and their diverse prognostic implications, current evidence supports a role for cardiovascular disease as a common pathophysiological ground. Brain<PERSON> white matter hyperintensities ( WMH<ORGANIZATION> ) are patchy white matter signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences commonly found in elderly individuals. WMH appear to have a vascular pathogenesis and have been shown to confer an increased risk of stroke and cognitive decline. Indeed, they were proposed as a marker for central nervous system frailty. Cardiovascular diseases seem to play a key role in the etiology of WMH<ORGANIZATION>. Carotid<PERSON> atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation were shown to be associated with higher WMH<ORGANIZATION> burden, while adequate blood pressure control has been reported reducing WMH<ORGANIZATION> progression. Aim of the present work is to review the available evidence linking WMH<ORGANIZATION> to cardiovascular disease, highlighting the complex interplay between cerebral and cardiovascular health.
