 The Strengthening and Stretching for Rheumatoid Arthritis<ORGANIZATION> of the Hand<GPE> ( SARAH<ORGANIZATION> ) program is a tailored, progressive 12-week exercise program for people with hand problems due to rheumatoid arthritis. The program was shown to be clinically and cost-effective in a large clinical trial and is recommended by the UK National Institute<ORGANIZATION> for Health<PERSON> and Care Excellence<PERSON> ( NICE<ORGANIZATION> ) guidelines for rheumatoid arthritis in adults. We have developed an online version of the SARAH<ORGANIZATION> program ( mySARAH<ORGANIZATION> ) to make the SARAH<ORGANIZATION> program widely accessible to people with rheumatoid arthritis. The purposes of this study were to develop mySARAH<ORGANIZATION> and to evaluate and address its usability issues. We developed mySARAH using a three-step process and gaining feedback from patient contributors. After initial development, mySARAH<ORGANIZATION> was tested in two iterative usability cycles in nine participants using a simplified think-aloud protocol and self-reported questionnaires. We also evaluated if participants executed the SARAH<ORGANIZATION> exercises correctly after watching the exercise videos included on the website. A preliminary version of mySARAH<ORGANIZATION> consisting of six sessions over a 12-week period and delivered via text, exercise videos, images, exercise plan form, exercise calendar, and links to additional information on rheumatoid arthritis was developed. Five participants ( 1 male ; 4 females ; median age 64 years ) and four participants ( four females ; median age 64.5 years ) took part in the first and second usability testing cycles respectively. Usability issues identified from Cycle 1 such as having a navigation tutorial video and individualised feedback on pain levels were addressed prior to Cycle 2. The need for more instructions to complete the mySARAH<ORGANIZATION> patient forms was identified in Cycle 2 and was rectified. Self-reports from both cycles indicated that participants found the program useful and easy to use and were confident in performing the SARAH<ORGANIZATION> exercises themselves. Eight of the nine participants correctly demonstrated all the exercises. mySARAH<ORGANIZATION> is the first online hand exercise intervention for people with rheumatoid arthritis. We actively involved target users in the development and usability evaluation and ensured mySARAH<ORGANIZATION> met their needs and preferences.
