 Rcs<GPE> phosphorelay system is a two-component signal transduction system, which can regulate the transcription of capsule polysaccharide and biofilm related genes in Enterobacteriaceae<GPE>. In this study, microarray technology was used to investigate the overall genes regulated by RcsA<ORGANIZATION>, RcsB<ORGANIZATION>, and RcsAB<ORGANIZATION> and the regulation mechanism in Klebsiella<GPE> pneumoniae, then COG<ORGANIZATION> analysis was performed to explore the functions of the differentially expressed genes. According to the microarray data result, a total of 45, 223 and 217 genes regulated by RcsA<ORGANIZATION>, RcsB<ORGANIZATION>, and RcsAB<ORGANIZATION> were screened. The result of COG<ORGANIZATION> analysis suggested that inorganic ion transport and metabolism related genes have a majority in RcsA<ORGANIZATION> regulating genes. Most of RcsB<ORGANIZATION> regulated genes were showed involved in energy production and conversion process. Besides Carbohydrate<ORGANIZATION> transport and metabolism genes were identified as the major components of the RcsAB<ORGANIZATION> regulated genes. 15 differentially expressed genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION> ( RT-qPCR ). The RT-qPCR results indicated that 13 genes consistent with microarray data. The results of this study provided important evidence for further research to investigate the influence of RcsA<ORGANIZATION>, RcsB<ORGANIZATION>, RcsAB<ORGANIZATION> regulators and further efforts to address the diseased caused by K.pneumoniae, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection.
