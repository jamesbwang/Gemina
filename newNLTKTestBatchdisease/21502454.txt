 Superficial surgical site infection ( SSI<ORGANIZATION> ) is common after appendectomy. This study aims to determine a clinical prediction score for SSI<ORGANIZATION> after appendectomy in complicated appendicitis. Data from randomized controlled trial of delayed versus primary wound closures in complicated appendicitis was used. Nineteen patient- and operative-related predictors were selected in the logit model. Clinical<PERSON> prediction score was then constructed using coefficients of significant predictors. Risk<PERSON> stratification was done by receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve analysis. Bootstrap<PERSON> technique was used to internal validate the score. Among 607 patients, the SSI<ORGANIZATION> incidence was 8.7 % ( 95 % CI 6.4, 11.2 ). Four predictors were significantly associated with SSI<ORGANIZATION>, i.e., presence of diabetes, incisional length > 7 cm, fecal contamination, and operative time > 75 min with the odds ratio of 2.6 ( 95 % CI 1.2, 5.9 ), 2.8 ( 1.5, 5.4 ), 3.6 ( 1.9, 6.8 ), and 3.4 ( 1.8, 6.5 ), respectively. Clinical<PERSON> prediction score ranged from 0 to 4.5 with its discrimination concordance ( C ) statistic of 0.74 ( 95 % CI 0.66, 0.81 ). Risk<PERSON> stratification classified patients into very low, low, moderate, and high risk groups for SSI<ORGANIZATION> when none, one, two, and more than two risk factors were presented with positive likelihood ratio of 1.00, 1.45, 3.32, and 9.28, respectively. A bootstrap demonstrated well calibration and thus good internal validation. Diabetes, incisional length, fecal contamination, and operative time could be used to predict SSI<ORGANIZATION> with acceptable discrimination. This clinical risk prediction should be useful in prediction of SSI<ORGANIZATION>. However, external validation should be performed.
