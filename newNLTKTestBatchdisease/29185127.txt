 Dialysis<GPE> treatment is known to lead to reduced quality of life ( QOL<ORGANIZATION> ) among patients. This decreased QOL<ORGANIZATION> is believed to influence medication compliance, although this effect has not yet been clarified. In this study, we investigated whether decreased QOL<ORGANIZATION> due to dialysis treatment does in fact influence medication compliance. Participants were 92 patients who self-managed their medication and were receiving dialysis treatment at Secomedic Hospital<ORGANIZATION> or Chiba<GPE> Central Medical Center<ORGANIZATION>. We surveyed their age, sex, dialysis period, and medication management situation, and administered the EQ-5D and Kidney Disease Quality<PERSON> of Life<ORGANIZATION> Instrument-Short Form. A multiple logistic regression analysis with medication compliance as the dependent variable and QOL<ORGANIZATION> as the independent variable was conducted. The recovery rate and effective response rate were both 100 %. The results indicated that patients with good sleep QOL<ORGANIZATION> ( mean or above ) had higher odds of medication compliance ( odds ratio, 3.36 ; 95 % confidence interval, 1.26-8.96 ;
