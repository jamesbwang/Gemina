 Noninfectious pulmonary complications ( NIPCs<ORGANIZATION> ) frequently occur following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT<ORGANIZATION> ). As there is no consensus on the description of the related pulmonary pathological lesions, pathologist reports and clinical conclusions are largely inconsistent in routine practice. The aim of our study was to provide an accurate overview of post allogeneic HSCT<ORGANIZATION> NIPCs from a large number of lung biopsies. We reviewed 61 lung biopsies in patients with an NIPC<ORGANIZATION>, including 51 surgical lung biopsies, 4 post mortem biopsies and 6 lung explants. We found both bronchiolar ( n=59 ) and alveolar/interstitial pathologies ( n=27 ). We described two types of bronchiolar lesions: bronchiolectasies ( n=37 ) and fibrous and cellular lesions with luminal narrowing ( n=43 ). We found a wide spectrum of airway/interstitial pathologies that were labelled using terminology of the 2013 American Thoracic Society<ORGANIZATION> and European Respiratory Society<ORGANIZATION> ( ATS/ERS ) classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias ( IIPs<ORGANIZATION> ), including the following: organizing pneumonia ( OP<ORGANIZATION>, n=8 ), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia ( NSIP<ORGANIZATION>, n=9 ), diffuse alveolar damage ( DAD<ORGANIZATION>, n=6 ), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia ( LIP<ORGANIZATION>, n=1 ) and pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis ( PPFE<ORGANIZATION>, n=2 ), as well as one instance of associated PPFE<ORGANIZATION> and NSIP<ORGANIZATION>. Interstitial pathology was associated with bronchiolar lesions in 41 % of the reviewed cases ( n=25 ). Lung<PERSON> airway and interstitial inflammation was still present in lung explants from patients who underwent lung transplantation for post allogeneic HSCT<ORGANIZATION> end-stage respiratory insufficiency. Herein<PERSON>, we describe a wide spectrum of pathological lung lesions encountered in post allogeneic HSCT<ORGANIZATION> NIPCs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
