 It is well known that the rise of FSH<ORGANIZATION> is a hallmark of menopause associated with osteoporosis and visceral adiposity. Recent days, Zahidi<PERSON> 's group reported that blocking FSH<ORGANIZATION> signals prevents bone loss in ovariectomized mice by inhibiting bone resorption and stimulating bone synthesis. The same research group also showed that blocking FSH<ORGANIZATION> action reduces body fat volume by promoting beige fat thermogenesis. These findings open new doors for novel and complementary treatments addressing post-menopausal osteoporosis and metabolic diseases.
