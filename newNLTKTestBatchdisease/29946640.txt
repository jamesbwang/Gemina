 To investigate the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF<ORGANIZATION> ) and serum of patients with Graves<PERSON> ' disease ( GD ) and periodontitis ( CP ), and to analyze the correlation between Graves<PERSON> ' disease and periodontitis. One hundred and twenty subjects were selected and divided into 4 groups: 30 healthy participants as the control group, 30 patients with CP<ORGANIZATION>, 30 patients with GD<ORGANIZATION>, and 30 patients with GD<ORGANIZATION> and CP<ORGANIZATION>. The serum and GCF<ORGANIZATION> level of IL-6 and TNF-α were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA<ORGANIZATION> ), and clinical periodontal parameters including probing depth ( PD ), clinical attachment level ( CAL<ORGANIZATION> ) and sulcus bleeding indexes ( SBI<ORGANIZATION> ) were examined. The date was analyzed with SPSS19.0 software package. The concentration of IL-6 and TNF-α in serum and GCF<ORGANIZATION> of patients with GD+CP group was significantly higher than that in CP<ORGANIZATION> group and GD<ORGANIZATION> group ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). The level of IL-6 and TNF-α in serum and GCF<ORGANIZATION> of patients in GD+CP group and GD<ORGANIZATION> group was positively correlated with FT3<ORGANIZATION> and FT4<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), and the correlation between GD+CP group was significantly higher than that in GD<ORGANIZATION> group. The level of IL-6 and TNF-α in GD+CP group were significantly higher than those in CP<ORGANIZATION> group and GD<ORGANIZATION> group, indicating that there is an interaction between periodontitis and Graves<PERSON> ' disease in immune mechanism.
