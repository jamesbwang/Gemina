 Despite extensive research no meaningful progress in systemic treatment of small cell lung cancer ( SCLC<ORGANIZATION> ) has been made in the past decades. Earlier attempts with immunotherapy including interferon and vaccination approaches had limited success. High mutational load, smoking history and potentially also the frequent presence of paraneoplastic phenomena-indicating an activated immune system-represent a rationale for a benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC<GPE>. However, the likelihood of response is diminished due to poor T-cell activation resulting from low expression of MHC<ORGANIZATION> class I antigens, low amounts of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs<ORGANIZATION> ) and low PD-L1 expression rates. Recently, early reports from studies with checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising results with the potential for long term disease control in a subset of SCLC<ORGANIZATION> patients. However, reliable predictive biomarkers to better define the population drawing most benefit are currently lacking. Results from ongoing phase III<ORGANIZATION> trials in different treatment lines and in the maintenance setting are eagerly awaited.
