 The use of oral poliovirus vaccine in a worldwide scale has led to a 99.9 % decrease in annual incidence of wild-type poliomyelitis and the eradication of serotype 2 poliovirus. However, the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses ( VDPVs<ORGANIZATION> ) is endangering the eradication program. Patients with combined immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of both vaccine-associated poliomyelitis and prolonged asymptomatic infection with immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs<ORGANIZATION> ( iVDPVs<ORGANIZATION> ). Herein<PERSON>, we present a severe combined immunodeficiency patient with prolonged and asymptomatic iVDPV<ORGANIZATION> infection. He continued to shed poliovirus during immunoglobulin replacement therapy and cleared the infection following successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT<ORGANIZATION> ). To explain the efficiency of HSCT<ORGANIZATION> in clearing the infection, we reviewed the literature for all reports of HSCT<ORGANIZATION> in iVDPV-excreting patients and discussed novel ideas about the role of different immune mechanisms, including cell-mediated interactions, in mounting immune responses against poliovirus infections. This study could provide further insights into the immune mechanisms contributing to the clearance of enteroviral infections.
