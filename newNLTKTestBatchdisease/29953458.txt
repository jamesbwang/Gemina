 The role of intraoperative cholangiogram ( IOC<ORGANIZATION> ) during cholecystectomy is debated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility, benefit and risk of performing systematic IOC<ORGANIZATION> in patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute gallstone-related disease. Between<PERSON> July 2013 and January 2015, all patients admitted for an acute gallstone-related condition and undergoing same-hospital-stay cholecystectomy were prospectively followed. IOC<ORGANIZATION> was systematically attempted and predictors of IOC<ORGANIZATION> failure were analyzed. Among the 581 enrolled patients, IOC<ORGANIZATION> was deliberately not performed in 3 cases. IOC<ORGANIZATION> was successful in 509/578 patients ( 88.1 % ). The main predictors of IOC<ORGANIZATION> failure were age, body mass index, male gender and associated acute cholecystitis. Thirty-two patients with suspected common bile duct stone on IOC<ORGANIZATION> underwent 38 unnecessary negative postoperative common bile duct investigations ( 32/509, 6.3 % ). There was one IOC-related adverse outcome ( mild pancreatitis, 1/578, 0.2 % ). IOC<ORGANIZATION> can be successfully and safely performed in the majority of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute gallstone-related disease. Although its positive predictive value is suboptimal and results in a number of unnecessary postoperative common bile duct investigations, IOC<ORGANIZATION> accurately rules out common bile duct stones in patients with acute gallstone-related conditions.
