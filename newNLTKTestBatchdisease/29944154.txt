 Chronic<PERSON> Kidney<ORGANIZATION> disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ) patients have a high prevalence of cardiovascular mortality, and among the risk factors are dyslipidemia and obesity, common findings in the early stages of CKD<ORGANIZATION>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of low protein diet ( LPD<ORGANIZATION> ) on the lipid and anthropometric profile in non-dialysis CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients. Forty CKD<PERSON> patients were studied ( 20 men, 62.7 ± 15.2 years, glomerular filtration rate ( GFR<ORGANIZATION> ) 26.16 ± 9.4 mL/min/1.73m2 ). LPD ( 0.6g/kg/d ) was prescribed for six months and, biochemical and anthropometric parameters like body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ), waist circumference and body fat mass ( assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry - DXA<ORGANIZATION> ) were evaluated before and after six months with LPD<ORGANIZATION>. After six months of nutritional intervention, patients presented reduction on BMI<ORGANIZATION> ( from 28.1 ± 5.6 to 27.0 ± 5.3 Kg/m2, p = 0.001 ), total cholesterol ( from 199.7 ± 57.1 to 176.0 ± 43.6mg/dL, p = 0.0001 ), LDL<ORGANIZATION> ( from 116.2 ± 48.1 to 97.4 ± 39.1 mg/dL, p = 0,001 ) and uric acid ( from 6.8 ± 1.4 to 6.2 ± 1.3 mg/dL, p = 0.004 ). In addition, GFR<ORGANIZATION> values were increased from 26.2 ± 9.5 to 28.9 ± 12.7mL/min ( p = 0.02 ). The energy, proteins, cholesterol and fiber intake were reduced significantly. LPD<ORGANIZATION> prescribe to non-dialysis CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients for six months was able to improve some cardiovascular risk factors as overweight and plasma lipid profile, suggesting that LPD<ORGANIZATION> can be also an important tool for protection against cardiovascular diseases in these patients.
