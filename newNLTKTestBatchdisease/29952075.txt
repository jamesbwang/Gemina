 Refractory cutaneous warts are difficult to eliminate. In-situ photo-immunotherapy ( ISPI<ORGANIZATION> ) is an innovative treatment concept combining local photothermal therapy ( PTT<ORGANIZATION> ) and topical immunotherapy using imiquimod. To compare the efficacy of ISPI<ORGANIZATION> versus topical imiquimod alone, a prospective randomized controlled trial was performed with patients suffering from refractory cutaneous warts. In both groups, approximately 50 % of the skin surface containing warts was treated for 6 weeks. On the basis of topical imiquimod, ISPI<ORGANIZATION> includes an additional 808 nm laser irradiation. Treatment response, temperatures during irradiation and histopathologic examination were evaluated. The complete response rate in the ISPI-group ( 22/36, 61.1 % ) was significantly higher than in the imiquimod alone group ( 11/34, 32.4 % ). In the ISPI<ORGANIZATION> group, the mean maximum temperature was 44.5 ± 5.1 °C, and obvious lymphocytic infiltration was found in the perivasculature of the dermis. There was no recurrence or worsening in both groups during the 12-months follow-up. No obvious adverse reaction was observed. This study demonstrates that ISPI<ORGANIZATION> can be used as an effective and safe treatment modality for refractory cutaneous warts. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
