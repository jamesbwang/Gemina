 Clinical<PERSON> and community samples indicate that eating disorders ( EDs<ORGANIZATION> ) and disordered eating behaviors ( DEBs<ORGANIZATION> ) may co-occur among adolescents and young adults at a weight status classified as overweight or obese. To determine the prevalence of EDs<ORGANIZATION> and DEBs<ORGANIZATION> among young adults at a weight status classified as overweight or obese using a nationally representative sample and to characterize differences in prevalence by sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Cross-sectional nationally representative data collected from Wave III<PERSON> of the National Longitudinal Study<ORGANIZATION> of Adolescent<ORGANIZATION> to Adult Health<PERSON> ( Add<ORGANIZATION> Health ). Young adults ages 18-24 years old. ED diagnosis and DEBs<ORGANIZATION> ( self-reported binge eating or unhealthy weight control behaviors including vomiting, fasting/skipping meals, or laxative/diuretic use to lose weight ). Covariates: age, sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, weight status, and education. Of the 14,322 young adults in the sample, 48.6 % were at a weight status classified as overweight or obese. Compared to young adults at a weight status classified as underweight or normal weight, those at a weight status classified as overweight or obese reported a higher rate of DEBs<ORGANIZATION> ( 29.3 vs 15.8 % in females, 15.4 vs 7.5 % in males ). Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that odds of engaging in DEBs<ORGANIZATION> were 2.32 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.05-2.61 ) times higher for females compared to males ; 1.66 ( 1.23-2.24 ) times higher for Asian/Pacific Islander compared to White<GPE> ; 1.62 ( 1.16-2.26 ) times higher for homosexual or bisexual compared to heterosexual ; 1.26 ( 1.09-1.44 ) times higher for high school or less versus more than high school education ; and 2.45 ( 2.16-2.79 ) times higher for obesity compared to normal weight, adjusting for all covariates. The high prevalence of DEBs<ORGANIZATION> particularly in young adults at a weight status classified as overweight or obese underscores the need for screening, referrals, and tailored interventions for DEBs<ORGANIZATION> in this population.
