 The group B Streptococcus ( GBS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a human commensal bacterium, which is capable of causing several infectious diseases in infants, and people with chronic diseases. GBS<ORGANIZATION> has been the most common cause of infections in urinary tract of the elders, but relatively few studies reported the urine-isolated GBS<ORGANIZATION> and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Hence<PERSON>, we decided to investigate GBS<ORGANIZATION> specially isolated from urine in Suzhou<GPE>, China<GPE>. 27 GBS samples were isolated from urine in Suzhou<GPE>, China<GPE>. The PCR<ORGANIZATION> and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to identify the serotype distribution. Susceptibility tests were based on MIC<ORGANIZATION> test and Kirby-Bauer test. Genome were sequenced via Illumina Hiseq<PERSON> platform and assembled by SPAdes<ORGANIZATION>. Genomes of five isolates were sequenced and submitted to NCBI<ORGANIZATION> genome database. The sequencing files in fastq format were submitted to NCBI<ORGANIZATION> SRA database. Five serotypes were identified. The resistant rates measured for tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin and fluoroquinolones were 74.1, 63.0, 44.4 and 48.1 %, respectively. 18.5 % of the isolates were nonsusceptible to nitrofurantoin. The resistance to tetracycline was mainly associated with the gene tetM<ORGANIZATION>. The erythromycin resistance was mainly associated with the genes ermB<ORGANIZATION> and mefE<ORGANIZATION>. The genes ermB<ORGANIZATION> and lnuB<ORGANIZATION> were the prevalent genes in cMLSB<ORGANIZATION> type. No known nitrofurantoin resistance gene was found in nitrofurantoin-nonsusceptible GBS<ORGANIZATION>. Five serotypes were identified in our study. High rates of GBS<ORGANIZATION> isolates were resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin and fluoroquinolones. The genes ermB<ORGANIZATION> and lnuB<ORGANIZATION> occupied high rates in cMLS<ORGANIZATION>
