 Huntington<GPE> 's disease ( HD<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the most common tandem repeat disorders and presents as a unique trilogy of cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms. One of the major mysteries of HD<ORGANIZATION> is why it selectively affects specific neuronal populations. A new article in BMC Biology<ORGANIZATION> provides a piece in the puzzle of pathogenesis. By demonstrating the delicate relationship between cortical and striatal neurons, it provokes broader questions of how we might understand HD as a disorder of synapses, neural circuits and systems biology.
