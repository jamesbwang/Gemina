 According to the literature, defects in para-umbilical hernias up to 2 cm in diameter could be sutured primarily. For defects larger than 2 cm in dimeters, mesh repair is recommended. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of para-umbilical hernia repair with proline mesh regardless of its size. In this retrospective study, patients with para-umbilical<ORGANIZATION> hernia, who were managed by onlay mesh placement were presented, and followed for 1-6 years. Several variables were studied including patients ' socio-demographic data, post-operative complications, morbidity and mortality. The series includes 58 patients, the age ranged from 18 to 85 years with median age of 44 years and inter-quartile range of 13.5 years. Mean body mass index was ( 30.9 ± 4.2 ). From 49 female patients ; 43 ( 87.8 % ) were multipara. Forty seven cases ( 81 % ) presented for the first time, and 11 cases ( 19 % ) had recurrent hernias. Twenty patients ( 34.5 % ) had hernia defect ≤2 cm, while 38 patients ( 65.5 % ) had hernia size > 2 cm. Superficial surgical site infection was found in 6 patients ( 10.34 % ). Seroma<PERSON> was found in one female patient ( 1.72 % ). One patient ( 1.72 % ) had recurrent hernia after 19 months. Mesh<PERSON> onlay repair by open surgery can be applied to all sizes of para umbilical hernias, it has low recurrence rate and the rates of morbidity and recurrence are comparable with international standard.
