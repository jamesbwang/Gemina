 Venous<GPE> thromboembolic disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients worldwide. The objective of this study is to compare interobserver reliability for qualitative and quantitative venous thromboembolism ( VTE<ORGANIZATION> ) risk assessments in hospitalized trauma patients. We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 40 randomly selected trauma patients admitted to a 448-bed urban level-I trauma center from January 2013 to January 2014. Interclass<ORGANIZATION> correlation coefficient ( ICC<ORGANIZATION> ) was calculated based on a two-way mixed model. The sample was equally distributed between patients admitted to the floor and the intensive care unit ( ICU<ORGANIZATION> ). Eight fourth-year medical students performed the risk assessments by the medical record. Two forms for risk assessment were used: a qualitative screening and a quantitative screening. The composite of intraobserver and interobserver variabilities was determined. The ICC<ORGANIZATION> for qualitative VTE<ORGANIZATION> risk assessments was 0.845 and for quantitative VTE<ORGANIZATION> risk assessment was 0.628. To optimize accuracy of VTE<ORGANIZATION> risk stratification and appropriate prophylaxis, medical students and first-year residents should be formally trained to perform quantitative assessments.
