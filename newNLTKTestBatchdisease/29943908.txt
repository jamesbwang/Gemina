 The development of de novo donor specific HLA<ORGANIZATION> antibody ( dnDSA<ORGANIZATION> ) is a critical feature contributing to late allograft failure. The complexity of the issue is further complicated by organ specific differences, detection techniques, reliance of tissue histopathology and changing diagnostic criteria, ineffective therapies, and lack of consensus. To tackle these issues, the Sensitization in Transplantation Assessment<ORGANIZATION> of Risk<GPE> ( STAR<ORGANIZATION> ) 2017 was initiated as a collaboration of the American Society<ORGANIZATION> of Transplantation<ORGANIZATION> and American Society<ORGANIZATION> of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics<PERSON> consisting of 8 working groups with the goal to provide guidelines on how to assess risk and risk stratify patients based on their potential alloimmune and DSA<ORGANIZATION> status. Herein<PERSON> is a summary of discussions by the Na√Øve Abdominal<ORGANIZATION> Working Group, highlighting currently available data and identifying gaps in our knowledge on the development and impact of dnDSA<ORGANIZATION> following kidney transplantation.
