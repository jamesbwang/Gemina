 A variety of instruments have been used to assess outcomes for patients with venous leg ulcers. This study sought to identify, evaluate and recommend the most appropriate patient-reported outcome measures ( PROMs<ORGANIZATION> ) for English-speaking patients with venous leg ulcers. This systematic review used a two-stage search approach. Electronic searches of major databases including MEDLINE<ORGANIZATION> were completed in October 2015, and then updated in July 2016. Additional studies were identified from citation checking. Study<PERSON> selection, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken independently by at least two reviewers. Evaluation and summary of measurement properties of identified PROMs were done using standard and adapted study-relevant criteria. Ten studies with data for four generic PROMS and six condition-specific measures were identified. No generic PROM<ORGANIZATION> showed adequate content and criterion validity ; however, the EuroQoL Five Dimensions<ORGANIZATION> ( EQ-5D™ ), Nottingham Health Profile<PERSON> ( NHP<ORGANIZATION> ) and 12-item Short-Form Health Survey ( SF-12® ) had good acceptability. In general, the EQ-5D™ showed poor responsiveness in patients with venous leg ulcers. Most condition-specific PROMs<ORGANIZATION> demonstrated poor criterion and construct validity. Overall, there was some evidence of internal consistency for the Venous Leg Ulcer Quality<ORGANIZATION> of Life<GPE> ( VLU-QoL ) and the Sheffield<ORGANIZATION> Preference-based Venous Ulcer<PERSON> questionnaire ( SPVU-5D ). Test-retest reliability was satisfactory for the Venous Leg Ulcer<ORGANIZATION> Self-Efficacy Tool ( VeLUSET<ORGANIZATION> ). The NHP<ORGANIZATION> and VLU-QoL questionnaire seemed the most suitable PROMs for use by clinicians. However, a valid condition-specific PROM<ORGANIZATION> is still required.
