 Little<GPE> is known about the development of psychosis during hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ<ORGANIZATION> ) treatment, especially in elderly patients affected by rheumatic diseases, with multiple comorbidities and treatments. To summarize the available evidence on HCQ-induced psychosis in elders, we performed a literature review. Additionally, individual case safety reports sent to the European Pharmacovigilance<ORGANIZATION> database ( EudraVigilance<ORGANIZATION> ) with HCQ<ORGANIZATION> as suspected drug and related to adverse events belonging to the System Organ Class<ORGANIZATION> 'Psychiatric disorders ' were shown. Over the years, evidence was published about the risk of neuropsychiatric clinical manifestations during HCQ<ORGANIZATION> treatment for rheumatic diseases, but few of them were related to elderly patients. These adverse events can include less severe clinical manifestations such as affect lability and nervousness or more severe conditions such as actual psychosis and suicidal tendencies, which frequency are actually unknown. The presence of risk factors in these patients may precipitate HCQ-induced psychosis and their precocious detection could be associated with a risk minimization. Among predisposing risk factors, there are the co-exposure to interacting drugs, alcohol intake, familial history of psychiatric diseases, female gender, and the concomitant use of low-dose glucocorticoids. In some cases it was possible to reverse psychotic behaviour with the antipsychotic treatment or with HCQ<ORGANIZATION> suspension.
