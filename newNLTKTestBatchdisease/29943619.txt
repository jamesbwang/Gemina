 Background<PERSON> Calgranulin<ORGANIZATION> C ( S100A12<ORGANIZATION> ) is an innate immune peptide at the air-mucosal interface associated with neutrophil involvement, which when overexpressed has been implicated as a biomarker of inflammatory diseases. Decreased epithelial expression of certain innate immune peptides has been reported in chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS<ORGANIZATION> ). We hypothesized that S100A12<PERSON> is differentially expressed in the sinonasal mucosa of patients with CRS<ORGANIZATION> compared to controls and that S100A12<PERSON> is a potential biomarker of CRS-specific quality of life ( QOL<ORGANIZATION> ) and disease severity. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted which included 70 patients: 17 controls, 28 having CRS without ( CRSsNP<ORGANIZATION> ), and 25 with ( CRSwNP<ORGANIZATION> ) nasal polyps. The expression of S100A12<GPE> and human neutrophil elastase ( HNE<ORGANIZATION> ) was assessed in the anterior ethmoid tissues from all patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA<ORGANIZATION> ) and immunohistochemical ( IHC<ORGANIZATION> ) analyses. Disease-specific QOL<ORGANIZATION> ( Rhinosinusitis Disability Index<ORGANIZATION> ) and disease severity ( computed tomography [ CT ] and endoscopy ) were evaluated and correlated to the expression levels of S100A12<GPE>. Results S100A12<PERSON> and HNE<ORGANIZATION> were significantly elevated in patients with CRSsNP<ORGANIZATION> compared to normal controls ( P<PERSON> < .05 and P<PERSON> < .001, respectively ) and patients with CRSwNP<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < .05 and P<PERSON> < .001, respectively ), as measured by ELISA<ORGANIZATION> and IHC<ORGANIZATION> analyses. Patients with CRS<ORGANIZATION> exhibited worse CRS-specific disease severity compared to normal controls ( P<PERSON> < .05 ), and the increased protein levels of S100A12<PERSON> were significantly correlated to disease severity, represented by CT<ORGANIZATION> scores ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). Conclusions S100A12 is differentially expressed in CRS<ORGANIZATION> subtypes and is significantly elevated in patients with CRSsNP<ORGANIZATION> and associated with CRS-specific disease severity.
