 Early breaches in B<GPE> cell tolerance are central to type 1 diabetes progression in mouse and man. Conventional BCR<ORGANIZATION> transgenic mouse models ( VH125.Tg NOD ) reveal the power of B cell specificity to drive disease as APCs<ORGANIZATION>. However, in conventional fixed IgM<ORGANIZATION> models, comprehensive assessment of B cell development is limited. To provide more accurate insight into the developmental and functional fates of anti-insulin B cells, we generated a new NOD<ORGANIZATION> model ( V
