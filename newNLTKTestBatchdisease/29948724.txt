 Aggregated amyloid beta ( Aβ ) peptides are believed to play a decisive role in the pathology of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ). Previous evidence suggested that exercise contributes to the improvement of cognitive decline and slows down pathogenesis of AD<GPE> ; however, the exact mechanisms for this have not been fully understood. Here, we evaluated the effect of a 4-week moderate treadmill exercise on spatial memory via central and peripheral Aβ clearance mechanisms following developed AD-like neuropathology induced by intra-hippocampal Aβ
