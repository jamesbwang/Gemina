 Atopy<GPE> is defined as excess allergen-specific IgE<ORGANIZATION> ( A-IgE ). IgE<ORGANIZATION> is produced by plasma cells that differentiate from allergen-specific B cells. B cells are known to be killed by chemotherapy ; however, it is not known whether A-IgE-secreting plasma cells are killed or inhibited by chemotherapy. If yes, serum A-IgE levels would be expected to decrease after chemotherapy. We aimed to determine whether A-IgE levels in atopic individuals ( serum A-IgE â‰¥0.35 kUA/L ) decrease into the nonatopic range ( < 0.35 kUA/L ) after chemotherapy. In 105 patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia, we measured serum A-IgE before and after chemotherapy. In a subset of these patients, we also measured B cell counts before and after chemotherapy. Of the 105 patients, 36 were atopic. In these patients, median A-IgE level before chemotherapy was 1.6 kUA/L whereas the median level after chemotherapy was 0.6 kUA/L ( p < 0.001 ). In 12/36 ( 33 % ) patients, A-IgE levels decreased into the nonatopic range. In nonatopic patients ( n = 69 ), the median A-IgE level also dropped: from 0.04 kUA/L before to 0.03 kUA/L after chemotherapy ( p = 0.001 ). Among the total patients ( n = 105 ), the median pre: post-chemotherapy A-IgE ratio was 1.8 ( 2.6 in atopic and 1.5 in nonatopic patients ). In contrast, the median ratio of pre: post-chemotherapy B cell counts was 87.6. A-IgE levels decrease after chemotherapy but markedly less than B cell counts. Thus, at least some A-IgE plasma cells appear to survive chemotherapy.
