 To investigate the relationship of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF<ORGANIZATION> ) /vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) and imaging features with the therapeutic efficacy of Phosphorus-32 colloid interstitial radiotherapy in recurrent craniopharyngioma.Thirty-two patients with recurrent craniopharyngioma underwent phosphorus-32 colloid interstitial radiotherapy. The tumor imaging features were classified into 4 types according to the thickness of the cyst wall and signals of the cyst contents as shown by computed tomography ( CT ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) images. Protein expressions of VEGF<ORGANIZATION> and VEGFR-2 in craniopharyngioma tissues were evaluated with immunohistochemistry before radiotherapy. The tumor radiosensitivity was determined at 12 months after the interstitial radiotherapy.VEGF mainly expressed in the tumor cytoplasm, and VEGFR-2 expressed either in vascular endothelial cells or in tumor endothelial cells. VEGF/VEGFR-2 expressions varied significantly in cases sensitive or insensitive to the radiotherapy ( VEGF<ORGANIZATION>: P = .028 ; VEGFR-2: P = .017 ). Tumor imaging features were associated with the therapeutic efficacy of interstitial radiotherapy ( P<PERSON> = .000 ). VEGF<ORGANIZATION> expression had no association with the imaging features of tumors ( P<PERSON> = .226 ), but VEGFR-2 expression was associated with the imaging features of tumors ( P<PERSON> = .008 ) .Our results confirmed the association among imaging features, VEGFR-2 expressions, and tumor radiosensitivity in craniopharyngiomas. Imaging features and VEGFR-2 expressions may add useful data to the radiosensitive assessment of craniopharyngiomas.
