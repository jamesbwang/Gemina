 Recurrent patellar dislocation is a disabling condition, which can lead to articular cartilage injuries, osteochondral fractures, recurrent instability, pain, decreased activity and patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Trochlear dysplasia represents an important component of patellar dislocation.Imaging provides an objective basis for the morphological abnormalities and thus allows determination of the surgical strategy according to the concept of 'Ã  la carte ' surgery.The main surgical techniques of trochleoplasty are the sulcus deepening trochleoplasty, the 'Bereiter ' trochleoplasty and the recession trochleoplasty.At mid-term, all techniques have shown a postoperative improvement in clinical scores, with a low rate of recurrence of dislocation and a possible return to sport. But these techniques do not halt the progression of patellofemoral arthritis. Cite this article:
