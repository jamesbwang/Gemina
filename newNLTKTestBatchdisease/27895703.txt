 HIV-infected smokers are at relatively higher risk of cancer than HIV-infected non-smokers. HIV weakens the immune system and renders infected individuals more vulnerable to the carcinogenic effects of smoking. HIV-infected smokers suffer more aggressive forms of cancers than do non-smokers because of the cumulative effects of the virus and cigarette smoke carcinogens. The major types of cancer observed in HIV-infected smokers are lung, head and neck, esophageal, anal, and cervical cancers. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances in cancer outcomes, primarily in terms of cancer incidence, prevalence, and progression in HIV patients who are smokers.
