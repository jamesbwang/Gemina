 This study aims to reflect on the intertwining of certain key ideas about what we call `` health '' within the hegemonic biomedical paradigm: health, disease, health needs, medicalization and medical-industrial complex. This reflection is based on the philosophical contributions of Heller<PERSON> and Wiggins<PERSON> on needs ; on the discussion of some authors, especially Canguilhem<GPE>, about health and illness ; and Collins<PERSON> ' sociology of expertise. After pointing out some of the conundrums that arise from the conceptual fluidity of the topics abovementioned, we present a path forward, based on Collins<PERSON> ' proposals about the role of experts in political arguments, to resituate the discussion on health needs.
