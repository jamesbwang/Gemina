 The discovery of genomic alterations that drive the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ) has transformed how we treat metastatic disease. However, the promise of precision medicine remains elusive for the most commonly mutated oncogene in NSCLC<GPE>, KRAS<ORGANIZATION>. This is perhaps due to the substantial heterogeneity within the broader genomic context of KRAS-mutant NSCLC. At this time, approaches for treating metastatic KRAS-mutant NSCLC mirror those for treating NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> that lacks a known driver mutation, including standard chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic approaches. Ongoing research aims to define further subgroups of KRAS-mutant NSCLC based on mutation subtype and co-occurring mutations. These efforts offer the potential to optimize standard-of-care regimens within these emerging subgroups and harness innovative strategies to realize precision medicine in this setting.
