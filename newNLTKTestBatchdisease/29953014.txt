 Nonrestorative sleep ( NRS<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the cardinal symptoms of insomnia and can occur independent of other components of insomnia. Among the sleep disturbances, NRS<ORGANIZATION> has been little studied in the general population, even though this symptom plays an important role in several medical conditions associated with chronic inflammation such as heart disease, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, as well as various sleep disorders. There is paucity in the literature about effective treatments for NRS<ORGANIZATION>. Ashwagandha<GPE> ( Withania<GPE> somnifera ) has been demonstrated to reduce anxiety and stress, allowing the body to settle down and prepare for sleep. This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional study in NRS<ORGANIZATION> population.The NRS<ORGANIZATION> participants are identified using Restorative Sleep<PERSON> Questionnaire-weekly version ( RSQ-W ) questionnaire. Actigraphy<PERSON> and polysomnography are used for the objective assessment of sleep. The other assessments used are Hamilton Anxiety<PERSON> Depression Scale ( HADS<ORGANIZATION> ), World Health Organization Quality<PERSON> of Life<GPE> ( WHOQOL<ORGANIZATION> ) scales, and C-reactive protein. Routine<PERSON> blood and urine analyses will be conducted to assess the safety of treatment. Duration of study for each participant will be 50 days with `` day one '' for screening followed by randomization for the treatment. The duration for medicine/placebo intake shall be 42 days.Primary outcome will be to evaluate effect of daily supplement of ashwagandha extract compared with placebo in subjects with NRS<ORGANIZATION> at 6 weeks from baseline, as assessed by the total score of RSQ-W.
