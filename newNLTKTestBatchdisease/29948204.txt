 Chronic<GPE> clinical Toxoplasma gondii ( T. gondii ) infection is the primary disease state that causes severe encephalitis. CD44<ORGANIZATION> is a member of the cell adhesion molecule family and plays an important role in T. gondii infection. However, proteomic changes in CD44<ORGANIZATION> during chronic T. gondii infection have rarely been reported. Thus, an iTRAQ-based proteomic study coupled with 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to screen CD44-related proteins during chronic T. gondii infection. As a result, a total of 2612 proteins were reliably identified and quantified. Subsequently, 259, 106, and 249 differentially expressed proteins ( DEPs<ORGANIZATION> ) were compared between CD44- mice ( A ) vs wild-type mice ( B ), B<PERSON> vs wild-type mice infected with T. gondii ( C ), and C vs CD44- mice infected with T. gondii ( D ). Gene ontology, KEGG<ORGANIZATION> pathway, and protein-protein interaction analyses were performed on the DEPs<ORGANIZATION>. According to the results, immune-related proteins were altered significantly among the A vs B, B vs C, and C vs D comparisons, which might indicate that chronic T. gondii infection caused changes in the host immune response. Additionally, Ca
