 Background The prognosis of patients with recurrent World Health Organization ( WHO<ORGANIZATION> ) grade IV malignant glioma is dismal, and there is currently no effective therapy. We conducted a dose-finding and toxicity study in this population of patients, evaluating convection-enhanced, intratumoral delivery of the recombinant nonpathogenic polio-rhinovirus chimera ( PVSRIPO<ORGANIZATION> ). PVSRIPO<ORGANIZATION> recognizes the poliovirus receptor CD155<ORGANIZATION>, which is widely expressed in neoplastic cells of solid tumors and in major components of the tumor microenvironment. Methods We enrolled consecutive adult patients who had recurrent supratentorial WHO<ORGANIZATION> grade IV malignant glioma, confirmed on histopathological testing, with measurable disease ( contrast-enhancing tumor of ≥1 cm and ≤5.5 cm in the greatest dimension ). The study evaluated seven doses, ranging between 10
