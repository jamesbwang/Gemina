 West<GPE> Nile<ORGANIZATION> ( WN ) virus has been detected in Guadeloupe<GPE> since 2002. Even if no WN human cases have been detected so far, mosquitoes from Culex<GPE> genus especially Culex<PERSON> quinquefasciatus are recognized as potential WN vectors in Guadeloupe<GPE>. To evaluate the impact of local vector control activities on this mosquito species we assessed the resistance levels of Cx<GPE>. quinquefasciatus populations from three different sites from Guadeloupe<GPE> ( Abymes<ORGANIZATION>, Saint Fran√ßois<PERSON> and Gourbeyre<GPE> ) to malathion, temephos and deltamethrin. In addition, the frequencies of the L1014F<GPE> kdr and the G119S<ORGANIZATION> ace-1 mutations were established in Cx<GPE>. quinquefasciatus populations, as well as the constitutive expressions of five cytochrome P450 genes. Mosquito populations tested displayed high resistance to deltamethrin, moderate resistance to malathion ( Abymes<ORGANIZATION>, Gourbeyre<GPE> ) and low resistance to temephos ( Abymes<PERSON> et Gourbeyre ). Molecular analyses revealed high frequencies of both L1014F kdr and G119S<PERSON> ace-1 mutations in Cx<GPE>. quinquefasciatus populations, as well as overexpression of cytochrome P450 genes CYP9J45<ORGANIZATION>, CYP9J40<ORGANIZATION> and CYP6AA7<ORGANIZATION>. Finally, deltamethrin resistance and knock-down rates were strongly correlated with the frequency of the resistant kdr and ace-1 alleles, as well as with CYP9J40<ORGANIZATION> overexpression. These results should be taken into account to refine the current vector control strategies to prevent the appearance of Cx<GPE>. quinquefasciatus-borne diseases in Guadeloupe<GPE>.
