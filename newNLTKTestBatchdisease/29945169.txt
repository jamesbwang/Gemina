 P27A<GPE> is an unstructured 104mer synthetic peptide from P. falciparum TEX1<ORGANIZATION> blood-stage protein found to be the target of human antibodies inhibiting parasite growth. The present project aimed at evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of P27A<GPE> peptide vaccine in malaria non-exposed European<GPE> and exposed African<GPE> adults. This study was designed as a staggered, fast track, randomized, antigen and adjuvant dose-finding, multi-center phase Ia/Ib trial, conducted in Switzerland<GPE> and in Tanzania<GPE>. P27A<PERSON> antigen ( 10 or 50μg ), adjuvanted with Alhydrogel® or GLA-SE ( 2.5 or 5μg ), or control rabies vaccine ( Verorab® ) were administered intramuscularly to 16 malaria non-exposed and 40 exposed subjects on days 0, 28 and 56. Local<PERSON> and systemic adverse events ( AEs<ORGANIZATION> ) as well as humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed after each injection and during the 34-week follow-up. Most AEs were mild to moderate and resolved completely within 48 hours. Systemic AEs<PERSON> were more frequent in the formulation with Alum<PERSON> as compared to GLA-SE, whereas local AE were more frequent after GLA-SE. No serious AEs<ORGANIZATION> occurred. Supported by a mixed Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity, P27A<PERSON> induced a marked specific antibody response able to recognize TEX1<ORGANIZATION> in infected erythrocytes and to inhibit parasite growth through an ADCI<ORGANIZATION> dependent mechanism. Incidence of AEs<ORGANIZATION> and antibody responses were significantly lower in malaria-exposed Tanzanian than in non-exposed European<GPE> subjects. The candidate vaccine P27A<PERSON> was safe and induced an immunogenic response that was particularly robust in combination with GLA-SE. This formulation should be considered for future efficacy trials. This trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01949909<ORGANIZATION> ) and www.pactr.org ( PACTR201310000683408<ORGANIZATION> ).
