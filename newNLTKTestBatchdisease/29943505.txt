 Syphilis can be difficult to diagnose clinically and histologically because both its clinical and histologic patterns can mimic other dermatoses. In particular, we would like to highlight the potential to misdiagnose congenital syphilis as neonatal lupus erythematosus given their overlapping clinical, histologic, and serologic features. Despite the screening of mothers for syphilis as part of routine care early in pregnancy, this infection may still be acquired during the course of pregnancy and dermatopathologists and dermatologists should remember to consider it when evaluating neonates with suspected neonatal lupus. Estimation of the timing of infection can be made from a review of the mother 's prenatal medical records and the constellation of clinical features present in the neonate.
