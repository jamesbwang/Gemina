 Cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs<ORGANIZATION> ) are a major component of the colorectal cancer ( CRC<ORGANIZATION> ) tumor microenvironment. CAFs<ORGANIZATION> play an important role in tumor progression and metastasis, partly through the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) signaling pathway. We investigated whether the TGF-β family co-receptor endoglin is involved in CAF-mediated invasion and metastasis. CAF-specific endoglin expression was studied in CRC<ORGANIZATION> resection specimens using immunohistochemistry and related to metastases-free survival. Endoglin-mediated invasion was assessed in vitro by transwell invasion, using primary CRC-derived CAFs<ORGANIZATION>. Effects of CAF-specific endoglin expression on tumor cell invasion were investigated in a CRC<ORGANIZATION> zebrafish model, while liver metastases were assessed in a mouse model. CAFs<ORGANIZATION> specifically at invasive borders of CRC<ORGANIZATION> express endoglin and increased expression intensity correlated with increased disease stage. Endoglin-expressing CAFs<ORGANIZATION> were also detected in lymph node and liver metastases, suggesting a role in CRC<ORGANIZATION> metastasis formation. In stage-II CRC<ORGANIZATION>, CAF-specific endoglin expression at invasive borders correlated with poor metastasis-free survival. In vitro experiments revealed that endoglin is indispensable for bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP<ORGANIZATION> ) -9-induced signaling and CAF<ORGANIZATION> survival. Targeting endoglin using the neutralizing antibody TRC105<ORGANIZATION> inhibited CAF<ORGANIZATION> invasion in vitro. In zebrafish, endoglin-expressing fibroblasts enhanced colorectal tumor cell infiltration into the liver and decreased survival. Finally, CAF-specific endoglin targeting with TRC105<ORGANIZATION> decreased metastatic spread of CRC<ORGANIZATION> cells to the mouse liver. Endoglin-expressing CAFs<ORGANIZATION> contribute to CRC<ORGANIZATION> progression and metastasis. TRC105<ORGANIZATION> Treatment inhibits CAF<ORGANIZATION> invasion and tumor metastasis, indicating an additional target beyond the angiogenic endothelium, possibly contributing to beneficial effects reported during clinical evaluations.
