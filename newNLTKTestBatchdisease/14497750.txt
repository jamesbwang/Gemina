 In this review, we argue for the use of high-resolution computed tomography ( HRCT<ORGANIZATION> ) over chest X-ray in the initial evaluation of patients with sarcoidosis. Chest<PERSON> X-ray, which has long been used to classify disease severity and offer prognostication in sarcoidosis, has clear limitations compared with HRCT<ORGANIZATION>, including wider interobserver variability, a looser association with lung function, and poorer sensitivity to detect important lung manifestations of sarcoidosis. In addition, HRCT<ORGANIZATION> offers a diagnostic advantage, as it better depicts targets for biopsy, such as mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy and focal parenchymal disease. Newer data suggest that specific HRCT<ORGANIZATION> findings may be associated with important prognostic outcomes, such as increased mortality. As we elaborate in this update, we strongly recommend the use of HRCT<ORGANIZATION> in the initial evaluation of the patient with sarcoidosis.
