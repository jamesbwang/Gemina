 Neuromuscular disorders ( NMDs<ORGANIZATION> ) are chronic conditions that affect the neuromuscular system. Many NMDs<ORGANIZATION> currently have no cure, however as more effective therapies become available for NMD<ORGANIZATION> patients, these individuals will exhibit prolonged health- and/or lifespans. As a result, persons with NMDs<ORGANIZATION> will likely desire to engage in a more diverse variety of activities of daily living, including increased physical activity or exercise. Therefore, there is a need to increase our knowledge of the effects of acute exercise and chronic training on the neuromuscular system in NMD<ORGANIZATION> contexts. Here, we discuss the disease mechanisms and exercise biology of Duchenne<GPE> muscular dystrophy ( DMD<ORGANIZATION> ), spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA<ORGANIZATION> ), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 ( DM1<ORGANIZATION> ), which are among the most prevalent NMDs in children and adults. Evidence from clinical and pre-clinical studies are reviewed, with emphasis on the functional outcomes of exercise, as well as on the putative cellular mechanisms that drive exercise-induced remodeling of the neuromuscular system. Continued investigation of the molecular mechanisms of exercise adaptation in DMD<ORGANIZATION>, SMA<ORGANIZATION>, and DM1<ORGANIZATION> will assist in enhancing our understanding of the biology of these most prevalent NMDs<ORGANIZATION>. This information may also be useful for guiding the development of novel therapeutic targets for future pursuit.
