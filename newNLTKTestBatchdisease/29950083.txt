 To screen the target for the treatment of depression of Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma<PERSON> and Curcumae Radix<PERSON> using the pharmacological method of network pharmacology, in order to define the mechanism of antidepressant effect. Pharmacological data ( TCMSP<ORGANIZATION> ) of forall of chemical constituents of Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma<PERSON> and Curcumae Radix<PERSON> through traditional Chinese<GPE> medicine system ( TCMSP<ORGANIZATION> ) was retrieved to screen the target sites, and construct the component target PPI<ORGANIZATION> network. PharmGkb<ORGANIZATION> database was retrieved for the genes associated with depression, and the disease target was mapped using the Cytoscape<ORGANIZATION> software. The Cytoscape<ORGANIZATION> software was used to merge the network and filter the core network, and further analyze the gene GO function and the KEGG<ORGANIZATION> pathway enrichment. There were 62 nodes and 87 connections on the target PPI<ORGANIZATION> network. The PPI<ORGANIZATION> network had 1 289 nodes and 17 714 connections. After the network merged, the component-target-disease network had 1 337 nodes and 17 801 connections. Through screening the core network, there were 63 nodes and 935 connections, which represented the complex interaction between the components and the target. Gene GO<PERSON> functional analysis suggested that biological processes, molecular functions and cell components were involved. Gene KEGG<PERSON> pathway enrichment analysis showed associations with misfolded protein, secretory hormone secretion, and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. The possible mechanism for treating depression is the adjustment of wrong folding protein, sex hormone secretion and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons.
