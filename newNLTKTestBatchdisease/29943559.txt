 The aim of this study was to assess whether increased intestinal gas or fat content in the abdominal cavity is related to abdominal bloating, using three-dimensional abdominal computed tomography scan. Twenty-nine healthy individuals without abdominal bloating and organic disease ( 15 women ; mean age, 49 years ; range of age, 23-73 years ) and 30 patients with chronic recurrent abdominal bloating-diagnosed with functional bloating ( 10 women ; mean age, 53 years ; range of age, 35-75 years ) - participated in this study. The mean values of measured parameters were compared using independent sample t-test. The mean volume of total colon gas in bloated patients was similar to that in control subjects. The distribution of intra-abdominal gas was also similar between the two groups. However, the amount of gas in the transverse colon tended to be significantly higher in patients with bloating than in controls ( p=0.06 ). Body mass index was similar between the two groups ( 23.4Â±3.2 kg/m Bloating might not just be the result of gastrointestinal gas or intra-abdominal fat. Other contributing factors, such as localized abnormality in gas distribution and visceral hypersensitivity, may be involved.
