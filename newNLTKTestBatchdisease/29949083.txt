 This was primarily to perform a retrospective analysis of 1000 emergency dental visits in order to characterize the nature of the dental emergency and the treatment provided and secondly to define a guideline for dental emergency treatment in children including pain management. A retrospective review was conducted of 1000 patients ( aged 0-16 years ) who visited the dental emergency service of the paediatric dental clinic at the Ghent University Hospital<ORGANIZATION>, Belgium<GPE> over a period of 3 years. Data regarding age, gender, reason for visit, year of visit, consequent appointments and treatment provided were collected. Statistical analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics ( frequency distribution ) and Chi-square test, with significance level set as P<PERSON> < 0.05. The number of patients visiting with a dental emergency increased annually. Approximately half ( 50.2 % ) of all paediatric dental emergency consultations were based on pain due to caries and its consequences. More than a quartile ( 26.7 % ) of emergency patients suffered from dental trauma of either primar or permanent teeth. The majority ( 96.7 % ) of the patients reported pain, 16.3 % of the patients did not necessarily need immediate attention. Dental<ORGANIZATION> emergencies in a university hospital based setting were predominantly related to caries and trauma. A precise definition of dental emergencies is recommended in order to prevent abuse of paediatric emergency services.
