 Physical<GPE> inactivity and sedentary behaviour is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. High intensity interval training ( HIIT<ORGANIZATION> ) has been shown to improve important health parameters. The aim of the present study was to assess the combined adaptations of the cardiac autonomic nervous system and myocardial functional and mechanical parameters to HIIT<ORGANIZATION>. Forty physically inactive and highly sedentary males completed 2-weeks of HIIT<ORGANIZATION> and control period. The HIIT<ORGANIZATION> protocol consisted of 3x30-second maximal cycle ergometer sprints against a resistance of 7.5 % body weight, interspersed with 2-minutes of active recovery. Total power spectral density ( PSD<ORGANIZATION> ) and associated low-frequency ( LF ) and high-frequency ( HF ) power spectral components of heart rate variability were recorded. Conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography recorded left ventricular ( LV ) structural, functional and mechanical parameters. HIIT<ORGANIZATION> produced a significant increase in total ln PSD<ORGANIZATION> and ln HF, and significant decrease in LF/HF ratio ( all p & lt ; 0.05 ) compared to the control period. HIIT<ORGANIZATION> produced significant improvements in LV diastolic function, including lateral E ', E/E ', E deceleration time, and isovolumetric relaxation time ( p & lt ; 0.05 for all ). In this setting, there were significant improvements in global peak systolic strain rate, early and late diastolic strain rate and early to late diastolic strain rate ratio ( all p & lt ; 0.05 ). HIIT<ORGANIZATION> was associated with a significant increase in cardiac autonomic modulation, demonstrated by a residual increase in cardiac vagal activity as well as significantly improved cardiac function and mechanics. This study demonstrates that HIIT<ORGANIZATION> may be an important stimulus to reduce the health implications associated with physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour.
