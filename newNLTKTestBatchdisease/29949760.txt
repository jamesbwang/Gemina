 The intestinal tract is constantly exposed to various stimuli. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC3s<ORGANIZATION> ) reside in lymphoid organs and in the intestinal tract and are required for immunity to enteric bacterial infection. However, the mechanisms that regulate the ILC3s<ORGANIZATION> in vivo remain incompletely defined. Here, we show that GPR183<ORGANIZATION>, a chemotactic receptor expressed on murine and human ILC3s<ORGANIZATION>, regulates ILC3<ORGANIZATION> migration toward its ligand 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol ( 7α,25-OHC ) in vitro, and GPR183<ORGANIZATION> deficiency in vivo leads to a disorganized distribution of ILC3s<ORGANIZATION> in mesenteric lymph nodes and decreased ILC3<ORGANIZATION> accumulation in the intestine. GPR183<ORGANIZATION> functions intrinsically in ILC3s<GPE>, and GPR183-deficient mice are more susceptible to enteric bacterial infection. Together, these results reveal a role for the GPR183-7α,25-OHC pathway in regulating the accumulation, distribution, and anti-microbial and tissue-protective functions of ILC3s<ORGANIZATION> and define a critical role for this pathway in promoting innate immunity to enteric bacterial infection.
