 Diabetics are at increased risk after stent implantation and potentially sensitive to the type of stent and dual anti-platelet therapy ( DAPT<ORGANIZATION> ). The randomized, double-blind LEADERS<ORGANIZATION> FREE trial compared 2432 patients at high bleeding risk ( HBR<ORGANIZATION> ) receiving either a polymer-free BA9-coated stent ( DCS<ORGANIZATION> ) or a bare metal stent ( BMS<ORGANIZATION> ) with 1 month of DAPT<ORGANIZATION>, and showed superior safety and efficacy of the DCS<ORGANIZATION> at 2 years. We report outcomes at 2 years of the pre-specified diabetic subgroup. The diabetic sub-group comprised 805 ( 33.1 % ) patients ; 262 ( 10.8 % ) were insulin-dependent ( IDDM<ORGANIZATION> ). Compared to non-diabetics, diabetics were younger and had more risk factors and multi-vessel disease. They suffered higher rates of death ( 15.6 vs. 12.2 %, p = 0.01 ), cardiac death ( 8.3 vs. 5.9 %, p = 0.02 ), myocardial infarction ( MI ) ( 11.1 vs. 7.8 %, p = 0.009 ) and definite/probable stent thrombosis ( 3.1 vs. 1.7 %, p = 0.01 ), but rates of clinically-indicated TLR<ORGANIZATION> ( 9.1 vs. 9.5 %, p = 0.93 ) and BARC<ORGANIZATION> 3-5 bleeding ( 10.2 vs. 8.4 %, p = 0.20 ) were comparable. Compared to diabetic patients treated with a BMS<ORGANIZATION>, diabetic DCS<ORGANIZATION> recipients required less clinically driven TLR<ORGANIZATION> ( 6.3 vs. 12.2 %, p = 0.006 ). The primary safety endpoint ( cardiac death, MI<ORGANIZATION>, definite/probable stent thrombosis ) occurred numerically less frequently in the DCS<ORGANIZATION> group ( 14.9 vs. 19.7 %, p = 0.10 ), and was significantly lower in IDDM<ORGANIZATION> patients ( 13.8 vs. 25.4 %, p = 0.03 ). BARC 3-5 was similar for patients treated with DCS<ORGANIZATION> ( 9.9 % ) and BMS<ORGANIZATION> ( 10.5 %, p = 0.84 ). In diabetic HBR<ORGANIZATION> patients, DCS<ORGANIZATION> significantly reduced re-intervention rates over BMS<ORGANIZATION>, and showed a strong trend towards a safety benefit at 2 years.
