 Among other applications, immunotherapy is used for the post-exposure treatment and/or prophylaxis of important infectious diseases, such as botulism, diphtheria, tetanus and rabies. The effectiveness of serum therapy is widely proven, but improvements on the immunoglobulin purification process and on the quality control are necessary to reduce the amount of protein aggregates. These may trigger adverse reactions in patients by activating the complement system and inducing the generation of anaphylatoxins. Herein<PERSON>, we used immunochemical methods to predict the quality of horse F ( ab ' ) Samples<PERSON> were submitted to protein quantification, SDS-PAGE, Western<GPE> blot analysis and molecular exclusion chromatography. The anticomplementary activity was determined in vitro by detecting the production of C5a/C5a desArg, the most potent anaphylatoxin. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey<PERSON> 's post-test, and differences were considered statistically significant when Horse F<PERSON> ( ab ' ) Anti-botulinum AB ( bivalent ), anti-diphtheric, antitetanic and anti-rabies horse F ( ab ' )
