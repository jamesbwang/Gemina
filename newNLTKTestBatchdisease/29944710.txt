 Sensitive, probe-based detection of multiple DNA<ORGANIZATION> targets is limited by the competitive reannealing of the antiparallel duplex DNA<ORGANIZATION> helix with the complementary DNA<ORGANIZATION> strand. To address this, we developed Cliffhanger<PERSON> primers, which create single-stranded DNA<ORGANIZATION> overhangs on PCR<ORGANIZATION> amplicons while simultaneously increasing the multiplex PCR<ORGANIZATION> efficacy and allowing PCR<ORGANIZATION> amplification using crude lysates of human faecal samples. A multiplex PCR that targeted eight genes from diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli plus an internal control was performed and compared to a routine method that consisted of culture followed by multiplex PCR<ORGANIZATION> with fragment length separation. A total of 2515 clinical faecal samples from patients with diarrhoea were tested using both methods, and there was a significant increase in clinical sensitivity and negative predictive value with the Cliffhanger<ORGANIZATION> method for seven out of eight genes. All Cliffhanger-only positive samples were confirmed by Sanger<PERSON> sequencing of the PCR<ORGANIZATION> amplicon. Notably, the Cliffhanger<ORGANIZATION> method reduced the total sample turn-around time in the laboratory from 20 hours to 6 hours. Hence<PERSON>, use of Cliffhanger<GPE> primers increased assay robustness, decreased turn-around time and increased PCR<ORGANIZATION> efficacy. This increased the overall clinical sensitivity without the loss of specificity for a heavily multiplexed PCR<ORGANIZATION> assay.
