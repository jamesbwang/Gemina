 Glycogen<PERSON> synthase kinase-3β ( GSK-3β ) is a key enzyme in hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins and is a promising therapeutic target in Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ). Here, we reported, for the first time, that the stereoisomers of Schisandrin B<PERSON> ( Sch<ORGANIZATION> B ), ( + ) -1, ( - ) -1, ( + ) -2, and ( - ) -2, were potent GSK-3β inhibitors. They were demonstrated to selectively target GSK-3β in an orthosteric binding mode, with IC<ORGANIZATION>
