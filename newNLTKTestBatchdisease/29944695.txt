 Pneumococcal<GPE> colonization is a precursor to pneumonia, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ( PCV<ORGANIZATION> ) can decrease vaccine-type ( VT ) colonization. Pneumococcal colonization studies are traditionally done among healthy children in the community ; however, VT<ORGANIZATION> colonization prevalence may differ between these children and those with pneumonia. We assessed overall and VT<ORGANIZATION> pneumococcal colonization and factors associated with colonization among children with and without pneumonia after Mozambique<PERSON> introduced 10-valent PCV<ORGANIZATION> ( PCV10<ORGANIZATION> ) in 2013. We used data from ongoing pneumonia surveillance in children aged < 5 years and from cross-sectional nasopharyngeal colonization surveys conducted in October 2014 -April 2015 and October 2015 -May 2016. Pneumonia<PERSON> was defined using WHO<ORGANIZATION> standard criteria for radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Children with pneumonia enrolled from January 2014 -April 2016 were compared to children without pneumonia enrolled from the cross-sectional surveys. Clinical<PERSON> data and nasopharyngeal ( NP ) swabs were collected from each child. NP specimens were cultured for pneumococci, and culture-negative specimens from children with pneumonia underwent polymerase chain reaction ( PCR<ORGANIZATION> ). Of 778 and 927 children with and without pneumonia, 97.4 % and 27.0 % were exposed to antibiotics before swab collection, respectively. Based on culture, pneumococcal colonization was 45.1 % for children with and 84.5 % for children without pneumonia ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) ; VT pneumococcal colonization was 18.6 % for children with and 23.4 % for children without pneumonia ( P<PERSON> = 0.02 ). The addition of PCR<ORGANIZATION> in children with pneumonia increased overall and VT-pneumococcal colonization to 79.2 % and 31.1 %, respectively. In multivariable analysis including PCR<ORGANIZATION> results, pneumonia was associated with VT<ORGANIZATION> pneumococcal colonization ( adjusted OR: 1.4, 95 % CI: 1.10-1.78 ). Vaccine-type pneumococcal colonization remains common among children with and without pneumonia post-PCV10 introduction in Mozambique<GPE>. In a population of children with high antibiotic exposure, the use of PCR<ORGANIZATION> for culture-negative NP swabs can improve assessment of pneumococcal colonization and circulating serotypes.
