 The genetic skin condition, epidermolysis bullosa ( EB ) causes the skin to be fragile and blister. As a result, blisters need to be lanced and the skin needs to be dressed with specialist dressings for protection and to promote wound healing. a prospective case series and product evaluation of the Allevynâ„¢ Gentle Border Lite<PERSON> dressing range was conducted, with four paediatric patients diagnosed with the following types of EB: recessive dystrophic ( generalised severe ), dominant dystrophic, simplex ( generalised severe ) and junctional ( localised ). Specialist EB nurses at Birmingham Children<ORGANIZATION> 's Hospital<ORGANIZATION> conducted the evaluation and compiled the case series. Management and outcomes: clinical, patient and health economic outcomes were captured. The outcomes reported suggest an increase in dressing time wear and a reduction in dressing changes when comparing Allevyn Gentle Border<PERSON> Lite dressings to the patient 's regular foam dressing regime. Furthermore, a cost saving measure could be shown. this small case series suggests that the use of the Allevyn Gentle Border<ORGANIZATION> Lite dressing range can positively impact the clinical, patient and health economic outcomes of paediatric EB patients.
