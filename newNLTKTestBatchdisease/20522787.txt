 Pannexins belong to a family of ATP-release channels expressed in almost all cell types. An increasing body of literature on pannexins suggests that these channels play dual and sometimes contradictory roles, contributing to normal cell function, as well as to the pathological progression of disease. In this review, we summarize our understanding of pannexin `` protective '' and `` harmful '' functions in inflammation, regeneration and mechanical signaling. We also suggest a possible basis for pannexin 's dual roles, related to extracellular ATP<ORGANIZATION> and K
