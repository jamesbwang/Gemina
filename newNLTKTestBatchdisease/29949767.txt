 Altered<GPE> glutamatergic neurotransmission is thought to contribute to mental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Copy-number variation in genes associated with glutamatergic synapses represents a source of genetic variability, possibly underlying neurological and mental disease susceptibility. The GRIK4<ORGANIZATION> gene encodes a high-affinity kainate receptor subunit of essentially unknown function, although de novo duplication of the 11q23.3-q24.1 locus to which it maps has been detected in autism and other disorders. To determine how changes in the dose of Grik4<GPE> affect synaptic activity, we studied mice overexpressing this gene in the forebrain. A mild gain in Grik4<GPE> enhances synaptic transmission, causing a persistent imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory activity and disturbing the circuits responsible for the main amygdala outputs. These changes in glutamatergic activity reverse when Grik4<PERSON> levels are normalized ; thus, they may account for the behavioral abnormalities in disorders like autism or schizophrenia.
