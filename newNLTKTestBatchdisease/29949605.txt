 Brucellosis<GPE> is a zoonotic disease of public health importance ; its prevalence varies globally. In low-income countries, brucellosis is an endemic and neglected disease affecting both animals and humans. This study was intended to establish brucellosis sero-prevalence among patients attending Wau<PERSON> hospital, South Sudan<GPE>. Across<PERSON> sectional study, was done among randomly selected patients attending Wau<PERSON> hospital. Data<PERSON> was collected using questionnaires and laboratory investigations. Rose Bengal<PERSON> plate Test<GPE> ( RBPT<ORGANIZATION> ), Serum<GPE> agglutination test ( SAT<ORGANIZATION> ) and Competitive Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay<ORGANIZATION> ( c-ELISA ) was used in the analysis of blood samples serially starting with RBPT<ORGANIZATION> which is more sensitive and least specific then SAT<ORGANIZATION>. c-ELISA test which is most specific and less sensitive compared to RBPT<ORGANIZATION> and SAT<ORGANIZATION> was then used to confirm presence of Brucella<GPE> antibodies in the samples. A total of 416 participants out of 1664 were enrolled to this study. The majority of participants were between 7-to-76 years of age with mean age of 30.72 ( SD+/- 12.83 ). The sero-positivity of patient 's blood samples for brucellosis using c-ELISA was 23.3 % ( 97/416 ) among patients presenting to Wau<GPE> hospital. Socio-demographic characteristics, occupation, clinical signs of disease and types of animals reared by animal owners showed no significant correlation with occurrence of sero-positivity among patient 's blood samples for brucellosis. While ethnicity ( Nilotic<ORGANIZATION> ), knowledge of zoonotic disease, and consumption of animal urine were statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ). The study found a high prevalence of brucellosis among febrile patients attending Wau<PERSON> hospital general outpatient clinic. There is need for co-ordination and collaboration between veterinary and health sectors of government to help prevent and control brucellosis in the region.
