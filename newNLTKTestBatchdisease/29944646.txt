 HIV self-testing ( HIVST<ORGANIZATION> ) provides a promising tool to screen sex partners for men who have sex with men ( MSM<ORGANIZATION> ) who engage in condomless sex and want to avoid HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection. While previous studies have demonstrated HIVST<ORGANIZATION> acceptability and increased testing uptake, limited data exists on its use between sex partners for point-of-sex HIV testing. This study examined prevalence and correlates of point-of-sex HIVST among Chinese<GSP> MSM<ORGANIZATION>. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 400 HIV-negative Chinese<GPE> MSM<ORGANIZATION> in 2017. Participants were recruited through a multifaceted sampling approach and self-administered an electronic questionnaire. Point-of-sex HIVST<ORGANIZATION> was measured by asking participants if they had ever conducted HIVST<ORGANIZATION> with a sex partner before sex to ensure that they both knew their HIV statuses. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify correlates of point-of-sex HIVST after controlling for age, education and sexual orientation. Overall, 19.2 % ( 77/400 ) men reported point-of-sex HIVST ( 51.3 % among self-testers ). Participants who had four or more HIV self-tests before had 7.57 fold greater odds ( 95 % CI: 3.75, 15.28 ) of reporting point-of-sex HIVST compared to those who had fewer HIVST<ORGANIZATION> experiences. Point-of-sex HIVST was otherwise not associated with most other socio-demographic or behavioral practices, suggesting that it may be broadly acceptable. A substantial proportion of Chinese<GPE> MSM<ORGANIZATION> had utilized HIVST<ORGANIZATION> with their partners before sex, especially among those who were more experienced with HIVST<ORGANIZATION>. Scale<PERSON> up and routine implementation of HIVST<ORGANIZATION> programs are further warranted to facilitate point-of-sex HIV testing.
