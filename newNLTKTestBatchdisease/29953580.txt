 Macropinocytosis<GPE> has been implicated in cardiovascular disorders, cancer, allergic diseases, viral and bacterial infections, and other pathologies. Unfortunately, the currently available pharmacological inhibitors of macropinocytosis interrupt other endocytic processes and have non-specific endocytosis-independent effects. The goal of the present study was to identify new, clinically relevant inhibitors of macropinocytosis using an FDA-approved drug library. In the present study, 640 FDA-approved compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit macropinocytosis. A series of secondary assays were performed to confirm inhibitory activity, determine IC The primary screen identified 14 compounds that at ~10 Î¼M concentration inhibit > 95 % of macropinocytotic solute internalization. Our results demonstrated that three lead compounds, namely imipramine, phenoxybenzamine, and vinblastine, potently inhibit ( IC The current findings identify imipramine as a new pharmacological tool to study macropinocytosis in cellular and biological systems. This study also suggests that imipramine might be a compelling candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in pathological processes involving macropinocytosis.
