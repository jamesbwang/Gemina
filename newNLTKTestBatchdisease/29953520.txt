 Infection with, and treatment of HIV<ORGANIZATION> is associated with effects on glycaemia and renal function. The purpose of this study was therefore to compare glycaemic control and albuminuria in HIV-positive and HIV-negative type 2 diabetic patients. Diabetic<ORGANIZATION> patients with and without HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection were recruited from a diabetic clinic at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital<FACILITY> in Soweto<GPE>, South Africa<GPE>. Data<PERSON> was collected on weight, height, HbA1c<ORGANIZATION>, fasting glucose, urine albumin: creatinine ratio, HIV<ORGANIZATION> status, CD4<ORGANIZATION> counts, viral load and concomitant therapies. Multivariable regression analysis was used to isolate the determinants of fasting glucose and HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> levels and risk factors for albuminuria. Data were collected from 106 HIV-positive and 214 HIV-negative diabetics. All HIV infected subjects were receiving anti-retroviral therapy. The determinants of fasting glucose levels ( log ) were HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection ( β = 0.04, p = 0.01 ) and use of anti-hypertensive agents ( β = 0.07, p = 0.0006 ), whilst for HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> levels ( log ) they were HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection ( β = -0.03, p = 0.03 ), BMI<ORGANIZATION> ( β = 0.004, p = 0.0005 ), statin use ( β = 0.04, p = 0.002 ) and glucose levels ( β = 0.01, p < 0.0005 ). In HIV-positive subjects, CD4<ORGANIZATION> counts were negatively associated with glucose levels ( β = -0.0002, p = 0.03 ). The risk factors for albuminuria were ( odds ratio [ 95 % CIs<ORGANIZATION> ] ) dyslipidaemia ( 1.94 [ 1.09, 3.44 ], p = 0.02 ) and HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> levels ( 1.24 [ 1.12, 1.38 ], p < 0.0001 ). These data suggest that glycaemic control is worse in type 2 diabetic subjects with HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection and that HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> underestimates glycaemia in these patients. Albuminuria<PERSON> was not associated with HIV-positivity. The negative relationship of CD4<ORGANIZATION> counts with glucose levels may reflect viral removal and easing of the associated inflammatory response. It is possible that the association of statin and anti-hypertensive therapies with high HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> and glucose levels, respectively, is due to such therapies being given largely to subjects with poor glycaemic control.
