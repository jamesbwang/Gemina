 Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease ( PD ) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. It is known that there are many factors, either genetic or environmental factors, involved in PD<GPE>, but the mechanism of PD<ORGANIZATION> is still not fully understood. Several animal models have been established to study the mechanisms of PD<ORGANIZATION>. Among these models, Drosophila<PERSON> melanogaster has been utilized as a valuable model to get insight into important features of PD<ORGANIZATION>. Drosophila<PERSON> melanogaster possesses a well-developed dopaminergic ( DA<ORGANIZATION> ) neuron system which is known to play an important role in PD<GPE> pathogenesis. The well understanding of DA<ORGANIZATION> neurons from early larval through adult stage makes Drosophila<PERSON> as a powerful model for investigating the progressive neurodegeneration in PD. Besides, the short life cycle of Drosophila<GPE> melanogaster serves an advantage in studying epidemiological features of PD<ORGANIZATION>. Most of PD<ORGANIZATION> symptoms can be mimicked in Drosophila<GPE> model such as progressive impairment in locomotion, DA<ORGANIZATION> neuron degeneration, and some other non-motor symptoms. The Drosophila<ORGANIZATION> models of PD<ORGANIZATION>, therefore, show a great potential in application for PD<ORGANIZATION> genetic and drug screening.
