 Endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS<ORGANIZATION> ) encoded by nitric oxide synthase 3 ( NOS3<ORGANIZATION> ), can generate nitric oxide ( NO<ORGANIZATION> ) which serves as an important deterrent to the pathogenesis of thrombosis by modulating the activation, adhesion and aggregate formation of platelets. Three serum miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( miR-195, miR-532 and miR-582 ) have been suggested as biomarkers for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT<ORGANIZATION> ), however their potential roles in DVT<ORGANIZATION> is not clear. The effect of miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> inhibiting the expression of NOS3<ORGANIZATION> was evaluated in vitro. miR-195, miR-532 and miR-582 mimic, inhibitor, and control miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> were transfected into endothelial cells. The roles of miR-195, miR-532 and miR-582 regulating the expression of eNOS<ORGANIZATION> were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR<ORGANIZATION>, Western Blotting<PERSON> and luciferase reporter assays. NO release was measured by Griess<ORGANIZATION> method. We confirmed NOS3<ORGANIZATION> as a direct target of miR-195 and miR-582, which binds to the 3'-UTR of NOS3<ORGANIZATION> mRNA in endothelial cells. A significantly inverse correlation between these two miRNAs<ORGANIZATION> and eNOS<ORGANIZATION> expression was detected. NO release from endothelial cells was decreased when the expression level of miR-195 and miR-582 was up-regulated. These findings indicated that miR-195 and miR-582 regulated NO<ORGANIZATION> release by targeting 3'-UTR of NOS3<ORGANIZATION> post-transcriptionally in endothelial cells. Therefore, miR-195 and miR-582 might play an important role in maintaining endothelial NO<ORGANIZATION> bioavailability and could be a novel target for treatment of thrombotic diseases.
