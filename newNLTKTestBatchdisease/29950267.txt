 Gastrointestinal<GPE> fistulae are classified as enteroenteric or enterocutaneous. Most gastrointestinal fistulae are formed after surgical procedures for inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy. For spontaneous enteroenteric fistulae, ischemia has been reported as a possible etiology. We report two cases of spontaneous enteroenteric fistulae arising after bowel ischemia ; a 38-year male with a 10-day history of severe abdominal pain with fever and vomiting, and a 22-year female with a one-week history of abdominal pain and diarrhea. Arterial<PERSON> and venous thrombi in association with enteroenteric fistulae were identified on computed tomography. These cases point towards acute mesenteric ischemia as a rare cause of spontaneous enteroenteric fistulae. Surgical management of these fistulae can be effective in resolving this complication.
