 This paper reports isolation of two monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs<ORGANIZATION> ) that bind to both a membrane protein and a cytoplasmic protein. Most Abs established as markers for autoimmune disease bind to cytoplasmic or nuclear substances. However, it remains unknown how these Abs are produced. On the other hand, there were examples where clones originally isolated as Abs<PERSON> that bind to membrane proteins also showed binding activity to cytoplasmic or nuclear substances. Based on these results, the following hypothesis has been proposed. The Abs that had been originally produced against a membrane protein showed cross reactivity against cytoplasmic or nuclear substances. In this study we reported isolation of Abs that bound to both a membrane protein, CADM1<ORGANIZATION>, and a cytoplasmic protein, α-actinin-4. The method adopted in the present could be generally applicable to isolation of Abs showing such dual specificity. Firstly, we constructed a huge human Ab library using various organs including naïve B-cell-rich organs such as bone marrow and umbilical cords. Then, we developed a comprehensive screening method for isolation of Abs that bound to cell surface antigens. Through extensive screenings with many kinds of cell we newly obtained a library composed of around 4000 independent clones that bind to membrane proteins. We screened this library with α-actinin-4 and succeeded in isolating two Abs. They bound to α-actinin-4 and a membrane protein CADM1<ORGANIZATION>. Furthermore, they are encoded by germline heavy and light chain variable genes ( V
