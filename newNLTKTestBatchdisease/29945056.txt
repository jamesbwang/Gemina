 We report a case of a 58-year-old male diagnosed with myofibroblastoma using mammography, ultrasound, computed tomography ( CT ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ), as well as present a review of the literature. The pathological diagnosis was myofibroblastoma with spindle cell neoplasm with immunoreactivity. Myofibroblastoma<PERSON> is a rare benign disease and there is a lack of reports of multimodality imaging of this disease. We review the imaging features of this rare disease across multiple imaging modalities with pathological correlation, and provide current treatment recommendations as well.
