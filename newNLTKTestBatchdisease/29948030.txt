 Atherosclerotic<GPE> cardiovascular disease ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ), a leading cause of death globally, has origins in childhood. Major risk factors include family history of premature CVD<ORGANIZATION>, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Lipoprotein<GPE> ( a ) [ Lp ( a ) ], an inherited lipoprotein, is associated with premature CVD<ORGANIZATION>, but its impact on cardiovascular health during childhood is less understood. The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between Lp<GPE> ( a ), family history of premature CVD<ORGANIZATION>, dyslipidemia, and vascular function and structure in a high-risk pediatric population. This is a single-center, cross-sectional study of 257 children referred to a preventive cardiology clinic. The independent variable, Lp<GPE> ( a ), separated children into high-Lp ( a ) [ Lp ( a ) â‰¥ 30 mg/dL ] and normal-Lp ( a ) groups [ Lp<GPE> ( a ) < 30 mg/dL ]. Dependent variables included family history of premature CVD<ORGANIZATION> ; dyslipidemia, defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol > 130 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) < 45 mg/dL, triglycerides ( TG ) > 100 mg/dL ; and vascular changes suggesting early atherosclerosis, as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV<ORGANIZATION> ) and carotid artery intima-media thickness ( CIMT<ORGANIZATION> ). Of the 257 children, 110 ( 42.8 % ) had high Lp ( a ) and 147 ( 57.2 % ) had normal Lp ( a ). There was a higher prevalence of African-American children in the high-Lp ( a ) group ( 19.3 % ) compared to the normal-Lp ( a ) group ( 2.1 % ) ( p < 0.001 ). High Lp<PERSON> ( a ) was associated with positive family history of premature CVD<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.03 ), higher-than-optimal HDL-C ( p = 0.02 ), and lower TG ( p < 0.001 ). There was no difference in PWV<ORGANIZATION> or CIMT<ORGANIZATION> between groups. High Lp<PERSON> ( a ) in children is associated with family history of premature CVD<ORGANIZATION> and is prevalent in African-American children. In children with high Lp ( a ), promotion of intensive lifestyle modifications is prudent to decrease premature CVD-related morbidity.
