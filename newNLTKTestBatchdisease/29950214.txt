 To investigate the safety and efficacy of decitabine combined with CAG<ORGANIZATION> regimen in the treat-ment of newly diagnosed elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ). Fourty-nine patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia ( except M3 ) who were admitted to our hospital were selected. All the patients were older than 50 years old, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could not be performed for various reasons. Decitabine-based chemotherapy regimens were used during induction therapy including single decitabine therapy ( DAC<ORGANIZATION> ), decitabine combined with CAG<ORGANIZATION> regimen ( DAC-CAG ) and decitabine combined with HAAG<ORGANIZATION> regimen ( DAC-HAAG ). Most of patients continued to use the original treatment after complete remission, while others were given the standard `` 3+7 '' regimen chemotherapy. A total of 2-4 courses of treatment was conducted in the majority of patients. All of the 49 patients completed the induction therapy, in which 26 cases achieved complete remission ( CR ), 7 cases achieved partial remission ( PR ) and no response ( NR ) existed in 16 cases. The complete remission and the overall response rate ( ORR<ORGANIZATION> ) were 53 % and 67 % respectively. The overall response rate of DAC<ORGANIZATION> group, DAC-CAG group and DAC-HAAG group were 17 %, 77 % and 63 % respectively. 14 patients were infected and 1 patients died of pulmonary infection during the induction therapy. The median number of suspended red blood cells and platelet infused were 9 units and 69 units respectively. Neutrophil<PERSON> recovery time was 15.1 days while the platelet recovery time was 20.1 days during the induction therapy. The mean follow-up time was 21 months. Overall survival ( OS ) was 75 % at 6 months, 30 % at 1 year, and 26 % at 2 year, while disease-free survival ( DFS<ORGANIZATION> ) was 83 % at 3 months, 54 % at 1 year, and 47 % at 2 year. The induction therapy could reach CR that was an independent prognostic factor, however, the initial white blood cell count, platelet count, age, chemotherapy regimen, prognostic stratification and whether complical by pnenmonia during chemotherapy were not independent prognostic factors. The induction efficacy of decitabine combined with chemotherapy is superior to that of decitabine alone. The outcome of induction chemotherapy is an independent prognostic factor, however, the high white blood cell count, poor karyotype, complications and AML<ORGANIZATION> with myelodysplasia-related changes do not affect long-term survival. DAC-CAG regimen is effective and have relatively few adverse reactions in AML<ORGANIZATION>. It is suitable for the patients who are ineligible for conventional chemotherapy.
