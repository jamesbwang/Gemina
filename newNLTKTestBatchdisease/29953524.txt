 Dysregulation of the stress response is implicated in drug addiction ; therefore, polymorphisms in stress-related genes may be involved in this disease. An analysis was performed to identify associations between variants in 11 stress-related genes, selected a priori, and heroin addiction. Two discovery samples of American<GPE> subjects of European<GPE> descent ( EA<ORGANIZATION>, n = 601 ) and of African Americans<ORGANIZATION> ( AA<ORGANIZATION>, n = 400 ) were analyzed separately. Ancestry<PERSON> was verified by principal component analysis. Final sets of 414 ( EA ) and 562 ( AA ) variants were analyzed after filtering of 846 high-quality variants. The main result was an association of a non-coding SNP<ORGANIZATION> rs255105 in the CRH<ORGANIZATION> ( CRF<ORGANIZATION> ) receptor 2 gene ( CRHR2<ORGANIZATION> ), in the discovery EA sample ( Pnominal<ORGANIZATION> = .00006 ; OR = 2.1 ; 95 % CI 1.4-3.1 ). The association signal remained significant after permutation-based multiple testing correction. The result was corroborated by an independent EA case sample ( n = 364 ). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SNP<ORGANIZATION> rs255105 is associated with the expression of a downstream long intergenic non-coding RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( lincRNA<ORGANIZATION> ) gene AC005154.6. AC005154.6 is highly expressed in the pituitary but its functions are unknown. LincRNAs have been previously associated with adaptive behavior, PTSD<ORGANIZATION>, and alcohol addiction. Further studies are warranted to corroborate the association results and to assess the potential relevance of this lincRNA to addiction and other stress-related disorders.
