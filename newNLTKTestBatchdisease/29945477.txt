 The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) represents a molecular target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ) patients with a mutation in the EGFR<ORGANIZATION> gene. Mutations of the EGFR<ORGANIZATION> gene that occur at a single position in NSCLC<GPE> tissue are found as single, whereas two or more mutations on the same allele are poorly detected and investigated. We investigated the presence of the EGFR<ORGANIZATION> gene mutations in tumor tissue by Sanger<PERSON> sequencing and ion torrent sequencing in an NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> patient at Stage IV<FACILITY> of disease. We found the presence of three coexisting mutations on the EGFR<ORGANIZATION> gene-two of which on exon 21 are present on the same allele, and the third, on exon 20, was analyzed by Sanger<PERSON> sequencing of the peripheral blood lymphocytes. The patient staged as cT4N0M1c<ORGANIZATION> ( Stage IV<PERSON> ) and started afatinib 40 mg daily 8 months ago, showing a clinical benefit. In this report we describe the case of an NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> patient harboring three coexisting mutations on the EGFR<ORGANIZATION> gene, two of which are present on the same allele. This mutation pattern may represent, for patient progeny, a genetic risk of cancer development. Therefore it should be possible to obtain screening guidelines to improve the risk calculation for lung cancer susceptibility in the future.
