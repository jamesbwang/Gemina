 Treatment for musculoskeletal fibromatosis remains challenging. Surgical excision for fibromatosis is the standard therapy but recurrence remains high. Corticosteroids<PERSON>, an anti-fibrogenic compound, have been used to treat early stage palmar fibromatosis, but the mechanism is unknown. We investigated the inhibitory mechanism effect of corticosteroids in the murine model of fibromatosis nodule as well as in cultured FSCs<ORGANIZATION>. Quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction ( PCR<ORGANIZATION> ) analysis and immunofluorescence ( IF ) staining for markers of myofibroblasts ( α-smooth muscle actin and type III<ORGANIZATION> collagen ) were used to examine the effect of dexamethasone on myofibroblasic differentiation of FSCs<ORGANIZATION> both in vitro and in vivo. Transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1 ) signaling and its downstream targets were examined using western blot analysis. TGF-β1 expression in FSCs<ORGANIZATION> before and after dexamethasone treatment was compared. In addition, inhibition of TGF-β1 expression was examined using RNA<ORGANIZATION> interference ( RNAi<ORGANIZATION> ) on FSCs<ORGANIZATION>, both in vitro and in vivo. Treating FSCs<ORGANIZATION> with dexamethasone inhibited FSCs<ORGANIZATION> ' myofibroblastic differentiation in vitro. Treating FSCs<ORGANIZATION> with dexamethasone before or after implantation further inhibited formation of fibromatosis nodules. Dexamethasone<PERSON> suppressed expression of TGF-β1 and pSmad2/3 by FSCs<ORGANIZATION> in vitro. TGF-β1 knockdown FSCs<ORGANIZATION> showed reducing myofibroblastic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, addition of TGF-β1 abolished dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of myofibroblastic differentiation. Dexamethasone inhibits the myofibroblastic differentiated potential of FSCs<ORGANIZATION> both in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of TGF-β1 expression in FSCs<GPE>. TGF-β1 plays a key role in myofibroblastic differentiation.
