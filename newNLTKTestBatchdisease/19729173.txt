 Neuromyelitis<GPE> optica ( NMO<ORGANIZATION> ) and myasthenia gravis ( MG ) are autoimmune diseases mediated by autoantibodies against either aquaporin 4 ( AQP4<ORGANIZATION> ) or acetylcholine receptor ( AChR<ORGANIZATION> ), respectively. Recently, we and others have reported an increased prevalence of NMO<ORGANIZATION> in patients with MG. To verify whether coexisting autoimmune disease may exacerbate experimental autoimmune MG, we tested whether active immunization with AQP4<ORGANIZATION> peptides or passive transfer of NMO-Ig can affect the severity of EAMG<ORGANIZATION>. Injection of either AQP4 peptide or NMO-Ig to EAMG<ORGANIZATION> or to naive mice caused increased fatigability and aggravation of EAMG<ORGANIZATION> symptoms as expressed by augmented muscle weakness ( but not paralysis ), decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation, increased neuromuscular jitter, and aberration of immune responses. Thus, our study shows increased disease severity in EAMG<GPE> mice following immunization with the NMO<ORGANIZATION> autoantigen AQP4<ORGANIZATION> or by NMO-Ig, mediated by augmented inflammatory response. This can explain exacerbation or increased susceptibility of patients with one autoimmune disease to develop additional autoimmune syndrome.
