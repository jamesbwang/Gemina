 Fetal<GPE> exposure to gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM<ORGANIZATION> ) predisposes children to future health complications including hypertension and cardiovascular disease. A key mechanism by which these complications occur is through the functional impairment of vascular progenitor cells, including endothelial colony forming cells ( ECFCs<ORGANIZATION> ). Previously, we showed that fetal ECFCs exposed to GDM<ORGANIZATION> have decreased vasculogenic potential and altered gene expression. In this study, we evaluate whether transgelin ( TAGLN<ORGANIZATION> ), which is increased in GDM-exposed ECFCs<ORGANIZATION>, contributes to vasculogenic dysfunction. TAGLN<ORGANIZATION> is an actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangement. We hypothesized that increased TAGLN<ORGANIZATION> expression in GDM-exposed fetal ECFCs<ORGANIZATION> decreases network formation by impairing cytoskeletal rearrangement resulting in reduced cell migration. To determine if TAGLN<ORGANIZATION> is required and/or sufficient to impair ECFC<ORGANIZATION> network formation, TAGLN<ORGANIZATION> was reduced and overexpressed in ECFCs<GPE> from GDM<ORGANIZATION> and uncomplicated pregnancies, respectively. Decreasing TAGLN<ORGANIZATION> expression in GDM-exposed ECFCs<ORGANIZATION> improved network formation and stability as well as increased migration. In contrast, overexpressing TAGLN<ORGANIZATION> in ECFCs<GPE> from uncomplicated pregnancies decreased network formation, network stability, migration, and alignment to laminar flow. Overall, these data suggest that increased TAGLN<ORGANIZATION> likely contributes to the vasculogenic dysfunction observed in GDM-exposed ECFCs<ORGANIZATION>, as it impairs ECFC<ORGANIZATION> migration, cell alignment, and network formation. Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying fetal ECFC<ORGANIZATION> dysfunction following GDM<ORGANIZATION> exposure is key to ascertain mechanistically the basis for cardiovascular disease predisposition later in life.
