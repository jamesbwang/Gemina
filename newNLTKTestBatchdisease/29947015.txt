 This retrospective study aims to demonstrate the effect of antitubercular treatment ( ATT<ORGANIZATION> ) on the pregnancy outcomes and prognoses of patients with genital tuberculosis ( GTB<ORGANIZATION> ) who had received laparoscopy and/or hysteroscopy. This study included 78 patients with infertility and who were diagnosed with GTB<ORGANIZATION> through laparoscopy and/or hysteroscopy over the period of November 2005 to October 2015. The recruited patients were divided into ATT<ORGANIZATION> and nonATT<ORGANIZATION> groups on the basis of ATT<ORGANIZATION> duration. The GTB<ORGANIZATION> recurrence rates, menstrual patterns, and pregnancy outcomes of the patients were determined at follow-up. Among the 78 patients, 46 received ATT<ORGANIZATION> and 32 did not receive ATT<ORGANIZATION>. The menstrual volumes of patients in the ATT<ORGANIZATION> group significantly decreased relative to those of patients in the nonATT<ORGANIZATION> group. GTB<ORGANIZATION> did not recur among all patients regardless of treatment. A total of 11 pregnancies ( 36.7 % ) in the ATT<ORGANIZATION> group and 19 pregnancies ( 63.3 % ) in the nonATT<ORGANIZATION> group were observed. Pregnancy rates significantly differed ( P<PERSON> = 0.002 ) between the two groups. ATT may decrease the menstrual volume and pregnancy rates of patients who were diagnosed with GTB<ORGANIZATION> through laparoscopy and/or hysteroscopy. In addition, ATT<ORGANIZATION> did not improve the prognosis of patients with chronic GTB<ORGANIZATION>.
