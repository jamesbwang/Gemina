 In this national comprehensive seroprevalence study, indirect ELISA<ORGANIZATION> test was used to evaluate Haemophilus<GPE> influenzae type b ( Hib ) anti-polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate ( PRP<ORGANIZATION> ) total antibodies ( IgM<ORGANIZATION>, IgG<ORGANIZATION>, IgA<ORGANIZATION> ) in 1,003 sera samples from routine medical check-up of healthy individuals attending the local medical facility in Jeddah<GPE>, Saudi Arabia<GPE> in the period from February 2014 to January 2016. Serum<PERSON> anti-CPS antibodies confer immunity against invasive Hib disease. An anti-CPS concentration of ⩾ 0.15 μg/mL is believed to be a serological indication for short-term immunity protection against invasive Hib disease, while a concentration of ⩾ 1.0 μg/mL is believed to be long-term protective. Results<PERSON> showed higher level of anti-Hib IgG<ORGANIZATION> ( 2.41 μg/ml average geometric mean concentration ( GMC<ORGANIZATION> ) regardless of age and gender, followed by levels of IgM<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.91 μg/ml ) and IgA<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.34 μg/ml ), reflecting the community immunity against Hib<PERSON>. Low<PERSON> anti-Hib level ( < 0.15 μg/ml of anti-PRP IgG ) in elderly people ( males aged 57-91 years and females aged 35-64 years ) may indicate a need for a booster dose of Hib<GPE> vaccine to elderly people in the community. The IgG<ORGANIZATION> prevalence over IgM<ORGANIZATION>, and IgM<ORGANIZATION> prevalence over IgA<ORGANIZATION> indicate the major role of IgG<ORGANIZATION> over IgM<ORGANIZATION> and IgA<ORGANIZATION> in keeping immunity in the track against Hib<PERSON>. Low<PERSON> level of IgM<ORGANIZATION> and IgA<ORGANIZATION> comparing to IgG<ORGANIZATION> may indicate the absence of Hib<ORGANIZATION> acute infections in the population.
