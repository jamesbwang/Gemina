 To identify the disease-causing gene of a four-generation Chinese<GPE> family with congenital cataract. To screen the disease-causing gene of the family, six disease genes of congenital cataract are screened by direct DNA<ORGANIZATION> sequencing, the cDNA of wild-type<ORGANIZATION> ( WT ) MIP<ORGANIZATION> gene, and P191R<PERSON> mutant MIP<ORGANIZATION> gene ( MT ) were constructed into pEGFP-C1 vector and pGH19<ORGANIZATION> vector. The recombinant plasmids of pEGFP-C1, WT<ORGANIZATION>, and mutant MIP were transfected into Hela<GPE> cell to check the localization and HEK293T<ORGANIZATION> cells to detect expression level of protein. The cRNA of WT<ORGANIZATION> and MT<ORGANIZATION> MIP gene were injected into Xenopus<PERSON> oocytes to measure the swelling rate. A novel missense mutation c.572C > G（p.P191R）at exon 3 of the MIP<ORGANIZATION> gene was identified and co-segregated with disease in the Chinese<GPE> family. The same amount of pEGFP-WT MIP<ORGANIZATION> and pEGFP- P191R MIP<PERSON> plasmids were transfected in Hela<GPE> cells. Confocal microscopy imaging showed that WT<ORGANIZATION> MIP protein predominantly localized on the plasma membrane, the mutant protein was rich in the cytoplasm in Hela<GPE> cells. Western blot results show that the expression level of P191R<GPE> mutant MIP<ORGANIZATION> was significantly lower than WT<ORGANIZATION> MIPincell<ORGANIZATION> membrane enriched lysates in HEK293T<ORGANIZATION> cells. Xenopus<PERSON> oocytes swelling assay showed that the P191R<GPE> mutation reduces the swelling rate of Xenopus<GPE> oocytes. The novel missense mutation c.572C > G（p.P191R）at exon 3 of the MIP<ORGANIZATION> gene was identified in a Chinese<GPE> family of congenital cataract. The mutation affects the traffic of MIP<ORGANIZATION> protein in the cells and reduces the expression level of MIP<ORGANIZATION> protein in the cell membrane. The mutation of MIP<ORGANIZATION> gene reduces the swelling ratio of Xenopus<GPE> oocytes.
