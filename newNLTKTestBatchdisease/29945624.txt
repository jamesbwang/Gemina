 Deaths in developing countries often occur outside health facilities, making it extremely difficult to gather reliable cause of death ( COD<ORGANIZATION> ) information. Automated COD<PERSON> assignment using a verbal autopsy instrument ( VAI<ORGANIZATION> ) has been proposed as a reliable and cost-effective alternative to traditional physician-certified verbal autopsy, but its performance is still being evaluated. The purpose of this study was to compare the similarity of diagnosis by Medical Assistants<ORGANIZATION> ( MA ) in the Matlab Health<ORGANIZATION> and Demographic Surveillance System<ORGANIZATION> ( HDSS<ORGANIZATION> ) with the SmartVA<ORGANIZATION> Analyze 1.2 ( Tariff 2.0 ) diagnosis. This study took place between January 2011 and April 2014 in Matlab<GPE>, Bangladesh<GPE>. MA with 3 years of medical training assigned COD<ORGANIZATION> to Matlab<GPE> residents by reviewing the information collected using the Population Health Metrics<ORGANIZATION> Research Consortium ( PHMRC<ORGANIZATION> ) long-form VAI<ORGANIZATION>. Smart VA<PERSON> Analyze 1.2 automatically assigned COD<ORGANIZATION> using the same questionnaire. COD agreement and cause-specific mortality fractions ( CSMFs<ORGANIZATION> ) were compared for MA<ORGANIZATION> and Tariff<GPE>. Of the 4969 verbal autopsy cases reviewed, 4328 were adults, 296 were children, and 345 were neonates. Cohen<PERSON> 's kappa was 0.38 ( 0.36, 0.40 ) for adults, 0.43 ( 0.38, 0.49 ) for children, and 0.27 ( 0.22, 0.33 ) for neonates. For adults, the top two COD<ORGANIZATION> for MA were stroke ( 29.6 % ) and ischemic heart diseases ( IHD<ORGANIZATION> ) ( 14.2 % ) and for Tariff<PERSON> these were stroke ( 32.0 % ) and IHD<ORGANIZATION> ( 14.0 % ). For children, the top two COD<ORGANIZATION> for MA were drowning ( 33.5 % ) and pneumonia ( 13.2 % ) and for Tariff<PERSON> these were also drowning ( 36.8 % ) and pneumonia ( 12.4 % ). For neonates, the top two COD<ORGANIZATION> for MA were birth asphyxia ( 41.2 % ) and meningitis/sepsis ( 22.3 % ) and for Tariff<PERSON> these were birth asphyxia ( 37.0 % ) and preterm delivery ( 30.9 % ). The CSMFs<ORGANIZATION> for Tariff<PERSON> and MA<ORGANIZATION> showed very close agreement across all age categories but some differences were observed for neonate preterm delivery and meningitis/sepsis. Given the known advantages of automated methods over physician certified verbal autopsy, the SmartVA<ORGANIZATION> software, incorporating the shortened VAI<ORGANIZATION> questionnaire and Tariff 2.0, could serve as a cost-effective alternative to Matlab MA<PERSON> to routinely collect and analyze verbal autopsy data in a HDSS<ORGANIZATION> to generate essential population level COD<ORGANIZATION> data for planning.
