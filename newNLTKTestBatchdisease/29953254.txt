 Inflammatory<GPE> bowel disease ( IBD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a complex disorder that is associated with significant morbidity. While many recent advances have been made with new diagnostic and therapeutic tools, a deeper understanding of its basic pathophysiology is needed to continue this trend towards improving treatments. By utilizing an unbiased, high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of two well-established mouse models of colitis, we set out to uncover novel coding and non-coding RNAs that are differentially expressed in the setting of colonic inflammation. RNA-seq analysis was performed using colonic tissue from two mouse models of colitis, a dextran sodium sulfate induced model and a genetic-induced model in mice lacking IL-10. We identified 81 coding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> that were commonly altered in both experimental models. Of these coding RNAs<ORGANIZATION>, 12 of the human orthologs were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of IBD<ORGANIZATION> patients. Interestingly, 5 of the 12 of human differentially expressed genes have not been previously identified as IBD-associated genes, including ubiquitin D. Our analysis also identified 15 non-coding RNAs that were differentially expressed in either mouse model. Surprisingly, only three non-coding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> were commonly dysregulated in both of these models. The discovery of these new coding and non-coding RNAs<ORGANIZATION> expands our transcriptional knowledge of mouse models of IBD<ORGANIZATION> and offers additional targets to deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD<ORGANIZATION>.
