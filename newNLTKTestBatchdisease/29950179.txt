 In recent years, the genus Asaia<GPE> ( Rhodospirillales: Acetobacteraceae ) has been isolated from different Anopheles species and presented as a promising tool to combat malaria. This bacterium has unique features such as presence in different organs of mosquitoes ( midgut, salivary glands and reproductive organs ) of female and male mosquitoes and vertical and horizontal transmission. These specifications lead to the possibility of introducing Asaia<PERSON> as a robust candidate for malaria vector control via paratransgenesis technology. Several studies have been performed on the microbiota of Anopheles<GPE> mosquitoes ( Diptera: Culicidae ) in Iran<GPE> and the Middle East<GPE> to find a suitable candidate for controlling the malaria based on paratransgenesis approaches. The present study is the first report of isolation, biochemical and molecular characterization of the genus Asaia<PERSON> within five different Anopheles species which originated from different zoogeographical zones in the south, east, and north of Iran<GPE>. Mosquitoes<PERSON> originated from field-collected and laboratory-reared colonies of five Anopheles spp. Adult mosquitoes were anesthetized ; their midguts were isolated by dissection, followed by grinding the midgut contents which were then cultured in enrichment broth media and later in CaCO Morphological<ORGANIZATION>, biochemical, physiological and molecular results indicated that all isolates are members of the genus Asaia<PERSON>. Contrary to previous opinions, our findings show that Asaia<GPE> bacteria are present in both insectary-reared colonies and field-collected mosquitoes and can be isolated by simple and specific methods. Furthermore, with respect to the fact that we isolated Asaia<PERSON> within the different Anopheles specimens from distinct climatic and zoogeographical regions, it is promising and may be concluded that species of this genus can tolerate the complicated environmental conditions of the vector-borne diseases endemic regions. Therefore, it can be considered as a promising target in paratransgenesis and vector control programs. However, we suggest that introducing the new technologies such as next generation sequencing and robust in silico approaches may pave the way to find a unique biomarker for rapid and reliable differentiation of the Asaia<ORGANIZATION> species.
