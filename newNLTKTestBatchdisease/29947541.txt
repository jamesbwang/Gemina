 Endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) and Nerve Growth Factor<PERSON> ( NGF<ORGANIZATION> ) are proteins, released from cancer-ridden tissues, which cause spontaneous pain and hypersensitivity to noxious stimuli. Here we examined the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of these two agents for evidence of their interactions. Individual small-medium cultured DRG<ORGANIZATION> sensory neurons responded to both ET-1 ( 50 nM, n=6 ) and NGF<ORGANIZATION> ( 100 ng/ml, n=4 ), with increased numbers of action potentials and decreased slow K ( + ) currents ; pre-exposure to ET-1 potentiated NGFÂ´s actions, but not vice versa. Behaviorally<PERSON>, single intraplantar ( i.pl. ) injection of low doses of ET-1 ( 20 pmol ) or NGF<ORGANIZATION> ( 100 ng ), did not increase hindpaw tactile or thermal sensitivity, but their simultaneous injections sensitized the paw to both modalities. Daily<PERSON> i.pl. injections of low ET-1 doses in male rats caused tactile sensitization after 21 days, and enabled further tactile and thermal sensitization from low dose NGF<ORGANIZATION>, in ipsilateral and contralateral hindpaws. Single injections of 100 ng NGF<ORGANIZATION>, without changing the paw 's tactile sensitivity by itself, acutely sensitized the ipsilateral paw to subsequent injections of low ET-1. The sensitization from repeated low ET-1 dosing and the cross-sensitization between NGF<ORGANIZATION> and ET-1 were both significantly greater in female than in male rats. These findings reveal a synergistic interaction between cutaneously administered low doses of NGF<ORGANIZATION> and ET-1, which could contribute to cancer-related pain.
