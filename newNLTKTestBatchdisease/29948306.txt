 Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis ( MPGN<ORGANIZATION> ) is a rare chronic kidney disease associated with complement activation. Recent immunofluorescence-based classification distinguishes between immune complex ( IC ) -mediated MPGN<ORGANIZATION>, with glomerular IgG<ORGANIZATION> and C3 deposits, and C3 glomerulopathies ( C3G ), with predominant C3 deposits. Genetic<PERSON> and autoimmune abnormalities causing hyperactivation of the complement alternative pathway have been found as frequently in patients with immune complex-associated MPGN<ORGANIZATION> ( IC-MPGN ) as in those with C3G<PERSON>. In the last decade, there have been great advances in research into the autoimmune causes of IC-MPGN and C3G<PERSON>. The complement-activating autoantibodies called C3-nephritic factors ( C3NeFs<ORGANIZATION> ), which are present in 40-80 % of patients, form a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies that stabilise the C3 convertase or the C5 convertase of the alternative pathway or both. A few patients, mainly with IC-MPGN, carry autoantibodies directed against the two components of the alternative pathway C3 convertase, factors B and C3b<ORGANIZATION>. Finally, autoantibodies against factor H, the main regulator of the alternative pathway, have been reported in a small proportion of patients with IC-MPGN or C3G. The identification of distinct pathogenetic patterns leading to kidney injury and of targets in the complement cascade may pave the way for tailored therapies for IC-MPGN and C3G<PERSON>, with specific complement inhibitors in the development pipeline.
