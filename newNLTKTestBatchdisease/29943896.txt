 Mixed-lineage leukemia ( MLL<ORGANIZATION> ) with multifarious partner genes leads to aggressive leukemia with dismal outcomes. Using panel-based targeted sequencing, we examined 90 cases with MLL-rearranged ( MLL-r ) childhood acute leukemia, including 55 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL<ORGANIZATION> ) and 35 with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ). MLL<ORGANIZATION> breakpoints and complete rearrangements were identified. A total of 37.8 % ( 34/90 ) of patients displayed a single direct MLL<ORGANIZATION> fusion gene, 15.6 % ( 14/90 ) carried a single reciprocal fusion, and 27.8 % ( 25/90 ) had both reciprocal MLL<ORGANIZATION> fusion alleles. The remaining 17 MLL-r cases exhibited complex translocations with homozygous disruptions on chromosome 11 or two breakpoints on the same MLL<ORGANIZATION> allele with a deletion of functional regions. A total of 77 patients ( 45 ALL and 32 AML ) received chemotherapy with a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Unexpectedly, we identified children with reciprocal MLL<ORGANIZATION> fusions who exhibited relatively favorable outcomes compared with those in children with complex translocations or a single direct MLL<ORGANIZATION> fusion allele ( 66.1 % vs. 24.6 % and 27.6 %, P<PERSON> = 0.001 ). Reciprocal MLL<PERSON> fusion may be functionally rescued by a partially truncated MLL<ORGANIZATION> protein. Comprehensive MLL-r analysis by targeted next-generation sequencing can provide detailed molecular information and is helpful for precise stratified treatment and clinical prognosis determination.
