 Animal<GPE> models of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ) can be used to determine the progressive neurodegeneration characteristics of AD in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ). Given the need for therapeutic interventions before the onset of frank AD, it is critical to examine if AD<ORGANIZATION> models demonstrate neuroanatomical remodeling in an equivalent preclinical phase. This manuscript examines the trajectories of brain and behavioural changes in the Triple<ORGANIZATION> transgenic mouse model ( 3xTg ) prior to the development of AD-like behaviours. The 3xTg mimics both Î²-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles through three mutations associated with familial AD, namely: PS1
