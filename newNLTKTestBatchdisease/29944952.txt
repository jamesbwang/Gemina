 Activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) is a pivotal cellular event in liver fibrosis. Therefore, improving our understanding of the molecular pathways that are involved in these processes is essential to generate new therapies for liver fibrosis. Greater knowledge of the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in liver fibrosis could improve understanding of the liver fibrosis pathogenesis. The aim of this review is to describe the present knowledge about the Wnt signaling pathway, which significantly participates in liver fibrosis and HSC<ORGANIZATION> activation, and look ahead on new perspectives of Wnt signaling pathway research. Moreover, we will discuss the different interactions with Wnt<PERSON> signaling pathway-regulated liver fibrosis. The Wnt signaling pathway modulates several important aspects of function, including cell proliferation, activation and differentiation. Targeting the Wnt signaling pathway can be a promising direction in liver fibrosis treatment. We discuss new perspectives of Wnt signaling pathway activation in liver fibrosis. For example, antagonist to Wnt<PERSON> and Wnt<ORGANIZATION> ligands could inhibit liver fibrosis by regulating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. These findings identify the Wnt signaling pathway as a potentially important for therapeutic targets in liver fibrosis. Future studies are needed in order to find safer and more effective Wnt-based drugs.
