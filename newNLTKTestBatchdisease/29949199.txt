 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a multifactorial disease that involves a complex interaction between genetics, diet and lifestyle. Although closely related with obese subjects, it is also common in lean humans. This study aimed to characterize the diet and lifestyle of lean and obese NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients in Chinese<GPE>. To characterize the diet and lifestyle of lean and obese NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients, we conducted a matched case-control study included 351 Chinese<GPE> adults. General characteristics, dietary intake and lifestyle were gathered by using a valid and reliable dietary questionnaire. We compared the dietary intake and lifestyle between lean and obese NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients. All NAFLD patients had more total caloric, calorigenic nutrients ( carbohydrate, fat and protein ), grain, potato, fruit and iron with higher levels of waist circumference ( WC ) and overtime work, but shorter sleep duration than their corresponding controls. Particularly, lean NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients consumed comparable total caloric, calorigenic nutrients iron, sleep duration and overtime work as obese NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients, though they consumed lower levels of grain, potato and fruit [ lean NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients vs obese NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients: mean ± SD, g/day grain: 291.8±83.8, 365.2±89.0 ; potato: 63.5±33.1, 80.4±37.6 ; fruit: 324.3±148.4, 414.0±220.4 ; P<PERSON> < 0.0001 ]. NAFLD patients had higher total caloric, calorigenic nutrients, grain, potato, fruit, iron and overtime work, but shorter sleep duration. Lean NAFLD<PERSON> patients had comparable total caloric, calorigenic nutrients, iron, sleep duration and overtime work as obese NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients. These features could be used to the nutritional education and therapeutic guidance for lean NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> patients in future.
