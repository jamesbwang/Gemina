 Vitamin<PERSON> D may be a modifiable risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD<ORGANIZATION> ). We tested the hypothesis that plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are causally associated with risk of Crohn<GPE> 's disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ). We used a Mendelian<GPE> randomization design in 120 013 individuals from the Copenhagen City Heart Study<ORGANIZATION>, the Copenhagen<ORGANIZATION> General Population Study, and a Copenhagen-based IBD<ORGANIZATION> patient cohort. 35 558 individuals had plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements available, and 115 110 were genotyped for rs7944926 and rs11234027 in DHCR7<ORGANIZATION> and rs10741657 and rs12794714 in CYP2R1<GPE> ; all variants associated with plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. We identified 653 cases of CD<ORGANIZATION> and 1265 of UC<ORGANIZATION>, of which 58 and 113 had 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements available. We also included genetic data from 408 455 individuals from the UK Biobank<ORGANIZATION> including 1707 CD cases and 3147 UC cases. Hazard<PERSON> ratios for higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for 10 nmol/L higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D were 1.04 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.93-1.16 ) for CD<ORGANIZATION> and 1.13 ( 1.06-1.21 ) for UC<ORGANIZATION>. A combined 25-hydroxyvitamin D allele score was associated with a 1.4 nmol/l increase in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and hazard ratios of 0.98 ( 0.94-1.03 ) for CD<ORGANIZATION> and 1.01 ( 0.97-1.05 ) for UC<ORGANIZATION>. Combining genetic data from Copenhagen<ORGANIZATION> studies and the UK Biobank<ORGANIZATION>, genetically determined vitamin D<PERSON> did not appear to influence risk of CD or UC. Our results do not support a major role for vitamin D deficiency in the development of IBD<ORGANIZATION>.
