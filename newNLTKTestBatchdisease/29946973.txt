 Diagnosis<GPE> and management of adult individuals with low bone mass and increased bone fragility before the age of 50 can be challenging. A number of these patients are diagnosed with mild osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) through detection of COL1A1<ORGANIZATION> or COL1A2<ORGANIZATION> mutations ; however, a clinical differentiation from early-onset osteoporosis ( EOOP<ORGANIZATION> ) may be difficult. The purpose of this study was to determine the bone microstructural differences between mild OI and EOOP<ORGANIZATION> patients. 29 patients showed mutations in COL1A1<GPE> or COL1A2<ORGANIZATION> and were classified as OI<ORGANIZATION>. Skeletal<ORGANIZATION> assessment included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA<ORGANIZATION> ), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography ( HR-pQCT ), and bone turnover serum analyses. Bone<PERSON> microstructure of 21/29 OI patients was assessed and compared to 23 age- and sex-matched patients clinically classified EOOP but without mutations in the known disease genes as well as to 20 healthy controls. In the OI<ORGANIZATION> patients, we did not observe an age-dependent decrease in DXA<ORGANIZATION> Z-scores. HR-pQCT revealed a significant reduction in volumetric BMD<ORGANIZATION> and microstructural parameters in the distal radius and tibia in both the OI<ORGANIZATION> and EOOP<ORGANIZATION> cohorts compared to the healthy controls. When comparing the bone microstructure of OI<ORGANIZATION> patients with the EOOP<ORGANIZATION> cohort, significant differences were found in terms of bone geometry in the radius, while no significant changes were detected in all other HR-pQCT parameters at the radius and tibia. Taken together, adult mild OI patients demonstrate a predominantly high bone turnover trabecular bone loss syndrome that shows minor microstructural differences compared to EOOP without mutation detection.
