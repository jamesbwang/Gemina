 The role of follow-up venous duplex ultrasound ( DUS<ORGANIZATION> ) after acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis ( DVT<ORGANIZATION> ) remains unclear, yet it is commonly performed. We aimed to clarify the role of follow-up DUS<ORGANIZATION>. Our primary objective was to determine the association between the presence of residual venous obstruction ( RVO<ORGANIZATION> ) on DUS<ORGANIZATION> and DVT<ORGANIZATION> recurrence or propagation ( rDVT<ORGANIZATION> ). Secondary objectives included finding risk factors associated with RVO<ORGANIZATION> and rDVT<ORGANIZATION>. We conducted a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with DVT<ORGANIZATION> on DUS from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, that received a follow-up DUS<ORGANIZATION>. Patient demographics, risk factors, medications, and DUS<ORGANIZATION> findings were recorded. Ten segments from the common femoral to distal calf veins were checked for the presence of RVO<ORGANIZATION>, DVT<ORGANIZATION> propagation, and recurrence. RVO<ORGANIZATION> was defined as any nonacute venous obstruction with more than 40 % of luminal diameter remaining during compression or the presence of chronic post-thrombotic occlusive disease. rDVT<ORGANIZATION> was measured as either a new acute DVT in the previously involved segment, or involvement of a new segment in the same extremity. A total of 185 lower extremities representing 156 patients met the inclusion criteria. RVO<ORGANIZATION> was noted in 61.1 % of limbs. The 3-year rDVT<ORGANIZATION> rate was 10.3 %. Patients with recurrent venous thromboembolism or thrombophilia had a higher risk of developing RVO<ORGANIZATION> ( odds ratio [ OR ], 2.89, P<PERSON> < .01 ; OR, 4.39, P<PERSON> = .04, respectively ). Extremities with larger clot burden had an increased risk of RVO<ORGANIZATION> on follow-up DUS<ORGANIZATION> ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 1.25 per segment ; P<PERSON> < .01 ). The presence and degree of RVO<ORGANIZATION> on follow-up DUS<ORGANIZATION> had an increased risk of rDVT<ORGANIZATION> on subsequent DUS<ORGANIZATION> ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 3.90, P<PERSON> = .04 ; OR, 1.21 per segment, P<PERSON> = .04, respectively ). Limbs with complete resolution of DVT<ORGANIZATION> by DUS<ORGANIZATION> had a significantly decreased risk of rDVT<ORGANIZATION> ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 0.26 ; P<PERSON> = .04 ). Extremities with larger initial clot burden exhibited an increased risk of subsequent RVO<ORGANIZATION>. The presence of RVO<ORGANIZATION> and, interestingly, the number of involved segments on follow-up DUS<ORGANIZATION> increased the risk of rDVT<ORGANIZATION>. Our results suggest that the presence of residual disease and increased RVO<ORGANIZATION> burden on follow-up DUS after an acute DVT<ORGANIZATION> may identify those patients who are at an increased risk for rDVT<ORGANIZATION> and may help guide the duration of anticoagulation therapy.
