 Myocardial dysfunction is a major cause of death in sepsis. MicroRNA-146b ( miR-146b ) has been reported to be related to myocardial disease. However, the role of miR-146b in sepsis as well as myocardial injury is still unclear. Septic cardiac dysfunction in mice was induced by cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP<ORGANIZATION> ) and miR-146b was found increased significantly in the myocardium tissue of CLP<ORGANIZATION> mice. It was found that up-regulation of miR-146b by agomiR<ORGANIZATION> injection suppressed expression of IL-1β in mice as well as myocardium apoptosis in CLP<ORGANIZATION> mice. However, suppression of miR-146b by antagomiR<ORGANIZATION> injection had inverse effects. Notch1<PERSON> was identified as a target gene of miR-146b by bioinformatics analysis. And it was verified that in cardiomyocytes, the decrease of miR146b<ORGANIZATION> led to increase of both the mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein level of Notch1<GPE> and vice versa. In septic mice serum stimulated cardiomyocytes, up-regulation of miR-146b decreased the level of Notch1<GPE> and Hes1<PERSON>. The knockout of Notch1<GPE> in transgenic mice showed that the deficiency of Notch1<PERSON> improved myocardial injury induced by CLP<ORGANIZATION> operation. The apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was relieved and the expression of IL-1β was decreased. In conclusion, miR-146b targets to Notch1<GPE> and protected cardiomyocytes against inflammation and apoptosis.
