  To investigate the incidence and influence of tumor cavitation ( TC) on survival outcomes of locally advanced squamous cell lung cancer ( LA-SqCLC) patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy ( C-CRT). Records of 789 stages IIIA/B squamous cell lung cancer ( SqCLC) patients treated with C-CRT who received 1 to 3 cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy during 60 to 66 Gy radiation therapy ( RT) were analyzed retrospectively. Primary endpoint was the association between overall survival ( OS) and pretreatment TC status. Secondary endpoints included locoregional progression-free survival ( LRPFS) , progression-free survival ( PFS) , and incidence of TC and correlated factors. Pretreatment TC occurred in 95 patients ( 12 %) , being significantly more common in those patients with ever-smoking history ( 12.6 % vs 3.9 %; P < .001) , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> > 5 % ( 20.9 % vs 7.1 %; P < .001) , and hemoptysis<symptom> ( 27.1 % vs 6.4 %; P < .001). Rates of acute and late toxicities were similar in patients who presented with and without TC ( P > .05 for each). For the whole cohort , at a median follow-up of 22.9 months ( range: 2.4-71.1) , the respective median OS , LRPFS , and PFS estimates were 23.7 , 14.7 , and 10.7 months. In multivariate analysis , stage IIIB<pathogen> disease ( P < .001; hazard ratio ( HR): 1.33; 95 % CI: 1.21-1.45) , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> > 5 % ( P < .001; HR: 2.10; 95 % CI: 1.85-2.35) , anemia<symptom> ( P < .001; HR: 1.82; 95 % CI: 1.67-1.97) , and presence of TC ( P < .001; HR: 1.54; 95 % CI: 1.37-1.71) appeared to be independently associated with poorer OS durations , likewise the LRPFS ( P < .001 for each of these covariates) , and PFS ( P < .001 for each of these covariates) , respectively. Present results showed that the TC occurred in 12 % of LA-SqCLC patients , which was strongly associated with poorer PFS , LRPFS , and OS outcomes after definitive C-CRT.
