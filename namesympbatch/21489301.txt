  Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori is a Gram negative bacterium<pathogen> that colonizes the stomach of approximately two-thirds of the human population and it is involved in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal diseases. This study sought to determine potential risk factors associated with seroprevalence of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> among dyspepsia patients in Cameroon for a better management of the disease. The study was carried out from August to December 2014 at Laquintinie Hospital and District Hospital of Bonassama in Douala metropolis. 205 patients ( 127 women and 78 men; mean age , 53.79 Â± 11.11 years; range , 35-75 years) were enrolled. Each subject gave a written consent. The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee of Medical Sciences. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on sociodemographic parameters and predisposing risk factors for Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection. For each patient , body mass index ( BMI) and direct inquiry about dyspeptic symptoms were done. Blood samples were tested for H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> antibodies , and ABO/Rhesus blood group antigen typing was performed. The overall prevalence was 64.39 %. All patients with upper<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pains<symptom> and frequent burping were H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> seropositive. We found that infection takes place early in childhood and adolescence , and reaches its peak at adulthood at 35 to 44 years. Sixty-two percent of women over 68 of men were infected. 80.39 % of patients with family history of gastric cancer were seropositive , while 19.60 % were seronegative ( p = 0.001). Prevalence of 79.09 and 47.4 % was recorded respectively for subjects with low , middle and high income levels ( p = 0.001). H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection rate was 60.48 % in blood group O patients compared with 70.37 % in other blood groups ( p = 0.203). 73 % of infected subjects over 59 % of uninfected ones currently take NSAIDs ( p = 0.0509). Overcrowded households have a higher rate of 65.32 % seropositivity in contrast with a lower rate of 33.33 % from norm household ( p = 0.197). 69.29 % of obese and overweight patients versus 58.24 % of subjects with normal weight were seropositive ( P = 0.215). The results of this study demonstrate that low income , family history of gastric cancer , clinical symptoms of nausea/vomiting and flatulence/bloating were risk factors of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection in this population.
