  Hepatic hemangioma is a common non-epithelial neoplasm of the liver. Presence of symptoms and uncertainty in diagnosis are the most common indications for surgery. Eighteen patients with hepatic hemangioma , operated on from January 2011 to December 2016 at the Hepato-pancreato-biliary surgical unit of Tata Memorial Hospital , were retrospectively analyzed. Main indications for operation were presence of symptoms , the most common being pain and diagnostic uncertainty. The median size of hemangioma was 9.9 cm ( range 3.2 to 24 cm). All patients underwent extra-capsular excision of hemangioma. The median operating time was 180 minutes ( range 75 to 460 minutes) and median blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 950 ml ( range 100 to 3,500 ml). Median post-operative stay was 5.5 days ( range 3 to 10 days). One ( 5.6 %) patient required re-exploration for post-operative hemorrhage<symptom> , Clavien Dindo ( CD) grade IIIb<pathogen> , and one ( 5.6 %) had postoperative purulent intra-abdominal collection requiring percutaneous cutaneous drainage CD grade IIIa. There was no postoperative mortality. Postoperative day 3 liver function tests were within normal limits. Size of the tumor did not correlate significantly with postoperative complications ( Surgical treatment of hemangioma should be guided by presence of symptoms or by the presence of diagnostic uncertainty , not by size alone. The size had no correlation with perioperative complications. The technique of extra-capsular excision is safe and technically feasible in most of the hemangiomas. This technique preserves maximum liver parenchyma , resulting in early postoperative recovery with minimal morbidity.
