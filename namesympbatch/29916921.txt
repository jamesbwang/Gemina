  We investigated the role of Tc-MIP-1404 ( Progenics Pharmaceuticals , Inc , New<pathogen> York , NY) SPECT/CT of PSMA expression in the assessment of treatment response in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We retrospectively analyzed Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT scans from 28 patients with metastatic prostate cancer examined before initiation and after completion of therapy. Eight of these patients had been treated with androgen deprivation therapy , 10 with docetaxel , and another 10 with external beam radiotherapy. On the CT images from SPECT/CT , treatment response was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria; independently from that analysis , maximal standardized uptake values ( SUVmax) were quantified in representative tumor lesions<symptom> and treatment response assumed at differences in SUVmax greater than 30 %. Radiographic response assessment was correlated to biochemical response ( BR) based on prostate-specific antigen serum levels. The concordance rate between SPECT and BR was 75 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.55-0.89) ( Cohen κ = 0.57; 95 % CI , 0.29-0.85; P ≤ 0.01) , higher than for that between SPECT and CT with 57 % ( 95 % CI , 0.37-0.76) ( κ = 0.40; 95 % CI , 0.14-0.65; P ≤ 0.01) , as well as that between CT and BR with 50 % ( 95 % CI , 0.31-0.69) ( κ = 0.31; 95 % CI , 0.06-0.57 , P ≤ 0.05). Discordant findings between SPECT and CT were most likely due to limitations of CT in assessing metastases in lymph nodes , as well as bone involvement , which was sometimes not detectable on CT scans. The high agreement between treatment response , as assessed by Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT and BR , suggests a possible role of that imaging tool for monitoring treatment in metastatic prostate cancer. Larger , ideally prospective trials are needed to help to reveal the full potential of SPECT imaging of PSMA expression in that regard.
