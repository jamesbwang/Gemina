  The Mini<pathogen> gastric bypass/One anastomosis gastric bypass ( MGB/OAGB) was the third most commonly performed procedure in Germany , with 13.9 % of all obesity and metabolic procedures in 2017 ( StuDoQ | MBE). This article reviews the currently published evidence for MGB/OAGB and the historical evidence on one anastomosis reconstruction. A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed and in Clinicaltrials.gov. from inception to 13 March 2018. A total of 35 studies met the inclusion criteria: 19 retrospective studies , 8 retrospective comparative trials , 2 systematic reviews , 3 systematic reviews and meta-analyses and 3 randomized clinical trials. A total of eight randomized clinical trials regarding MGB/OAGB are currently registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. In this study 35 eligible studies were included reporting data on > 15,000 patients. The 30-day mortality rate ranged from 0-0.9 % and severe complications needing intervention ranged from 0.8-7 % , whereas perioperative morbidity ranged from 3.2-10.8 %. The use of MGB/OAGB induced substantial weight<symptom> loss<symptom> with a total weight<symptom> loss<symptom> of 31-38 % after 1 year and 23-32 % after 5 years. Moreover , it showed a resolution or improvement in all major obesity-related diseases. Studies evaluating endpoints , such as end organ damage in diabetes , reduction of cardiovascular events and extending survival are missing and are available only for the Roux-en Y gastric bypass. This systematic review confirms the advantages of MGB/OAGB regarding weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and the antidiabetic effect in the short-term in comparison to Roux-en Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. The role of bile reflux as a possible risk factor for neoplastic lesions<symptom> in the long-term remains a point of discussion. The results of the registered randomized controlled trials will provide a better evidence in the future.
