  We previously reported that Androctonus australis<pathogen> hector ( Aah) venom induces inflammation<symptom> in several tissues , however limited information is available on its role in gastrointestinal tract. Here we evaluate the involvement of TNF-α in lipid metabolism in the small intestine after Aah envenomation. To address these issues , NMRI mice ( 3-month-old) were pre-treated with a TNF-α antagonist , 30 min prior to Aah venom injection. Redox status , cytotoxicity and histopathological changes were analyzed in small intestine 3 and 24 h after Aah injection. Lipid metabolism was evaluated through lipid tolerance test in sera. Lipid content in small intestine was also evaluated at different times after envenomation. Obtained results showed that Aah venom affects the intestinal integrity. This cytotoxicity could be associated with lipid peroxidation and altered or insufficient antioxidant system. These results also highlight the perturbation of lipid absorption in intestine tissue of envenomed mice. The use of TNF-α antagonist prior to Aah venom injection seems to be able to improve lipid profile , oxidative stress and antioxidant activity. These findings suggest that Aah venom induces lipid alterations in the intestinal tissue mechanisms involving of TNF- α.
