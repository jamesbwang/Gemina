  Patients with chronic hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection experience a range of symptoms including depression<symptom> , fatigue<symptom> and neurocognitive deficits , impairing quality of life. Depression<symptom> , in particular , may be reactive to increased psychosocial stress , and the physical symptoms of advanced HCV<pathogen> or associated comorbidities. However , even patients at an early stage of HCV<pathogen> infection , with minimal hepatic inflammation<symptom> or comorbidities , report more depressive symptoms and fatigue<symptom> than the general population. Similarly , specific neurocognitive deficits occur in early stage HCV<pathogen> infection and are independent of the presence of depression<symptom> or encephalopathy. Therefore , intracerebral neurobiological changes associated with HCV<pathogen> may potentially explain these symptoms. These changes may arise from infiltration of the brain by peripherally induced cytokines , as well as direct neuropathic effects of HCV<pathogen> viral particles penetrating the blood-brain barrier. These phenomena parallel those reported in human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infection. HCV-associated intracerebral changes include upregulated inflammatory responses , altered neurotransmitter levels , hormonal dysregulation , and release of neurotoxic substances. These may subsequently lead to abnormal neuronal conduction and function in areas of the brain governing affective responses , emotional processing , motivation , attention and concentration. Although direct-acting antiviral medications lead to high rates of HCV<pathogen> clearance , intracerebral changes may not be subsequently reversed and symptoms of depression<symptom> , fatigue<symptom> and neurocognitive deficits may persist. There is an ongoing role for multidisciplinary care and pharmacotherapy to manage these symptoms in HCV<pathogen> patients. Furthermore , there may be opportunities for future therapies to specifically target and ameliorate HCV-associated intracerebral changes.
