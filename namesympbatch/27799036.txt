  Mass effect induced by growing hematoma is one of the mechanisms by which intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) may result in brain injuries. Our goal was to investigate the damage mechanism of hydrostatic pressure associated with mass effect and the cooperative effect of hydrostatic pressure plus hemoglobin on neural injuries. Loading hydrostatic pressure on neurons and injecting agarose gel in the right striatum<pathogen> of rats was performed to establish the in vitro and vivo ICH models , respectively. The elevated hydrostatic pressure associated with ICH suppressed neurons and neural tissues viability , and disturbed the axons and dendrites in vitro and vivo. Moreover , hydrostatic pressure could upregulate the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and BAX , and downregulate Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Meanwhile , the toxicity of hemoglobin would be enhanced when conducted with hydrostatic pressure together. Furthermore , the exclusive hydrostatic pressure could upregulate the Piezo-2 expression , which reached a plateau at 8 h after ICH. And hemoglobin increased Piezo-2 expression significantly in vivo , and that was also promoted significantly by the elevated volume of Gel in the cooperative groups. Results indicated that hydrostatic pressure induced by mass effect not only gave rise to brain injuries directly , but also increased the toxicity of hemoglobin in the progress of secondary brain injury after ICH.
