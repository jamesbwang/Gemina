  Anal cancer may be prevented by treating anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions<symptom> ( HSIL). Ablative therapies are the most commonly used treatments , but they may not be appropriate for all patients including those with extensive HSIL or bleeding diastheses. Researchers have studied topical therapies for human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> related lesions<symptom> including anal HSIL. These therapies include patient-applied 5-fluorouracil , imiquimod and cidofovir , and provider-applied trichloroacetic acid. This review will discuss literature supporting efficacy of these products , which is based mainly on case series with few controlled trials having been conducted. Side effects are common with patient-applied topical therapy often requiring dose reduction and medication to treat pain. However , treatment discontinuations are infrequent. This review will also discuss some approaches to the use of these products in clinical practice.
