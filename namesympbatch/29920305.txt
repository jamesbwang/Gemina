  Group B Streptococcus<pathogen> ( GBS) is one the most common bacterium<pathogen> responsible of maternal infections during pregnancy. Offspring in utero-exposed to GBS-induced placental inflammation<symptom> displayed sex-specific forebrain injuries. Sex differences have been reported in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Hence , we hypothesized that female rats in utero-exposed to GBS may present sex-specific neurobehavioral impairments. Lewis rats were injected intraperitoneally every 12 h from gestational day ( G) 19 to G22 with either saline ( controls) or inactivated serotype Ia GBS ( 10
