  Species recognition mediates the association of individuals with conspecifics. Learned cues often facilitate species recognition via early social experience with parents and siblings. Yet , in some songbirds , the production of species-typical vocalizations develops in the absence of early social experiences. Here , we investigate the auditory-evoked neural responses of juvenile red-winged blackbirds ( Agelaius phoeniceus) , a nonparasitic ( parental) species within the Icterid family and contrast these results with a closely related Icterid parasitic species that lacks parental care , the brown-headed cowbird ( Molothrus ater<pathogen>). We demonstrate that immediate early gene ( IEG) activity in the caudomedial mesopallium ( CMM) is selectively evoked in response to conspecific non-learned vocalizations in comparison to 2 types of heterospecific non-learned vocalizations , independent of the acoustic similarity patterns between the playback stimuli. This pattern , however , was not detected in the caudomedial nidopallium ( NCM). Because the red-winged blackbird is a parental species , the conspecific non-learned vocalization is presumably a familiar sound<symptom> to the juvenile red-winged blackbird , whereas the heterospecific non-learned vocalizations are novel. We contrast results reported here with our recent demonstration of selective IEG induction in response to non-learned conspecific vocalizations in juvenile parasitic brown-headed cowbirds , in which conspecific non-learned vocalizations are presumably novel. In this case , selective IEG induction from conspecific non-learned vocalization occurred within NCM but not within CMM. By comparing closely related species with stark differences in the early exposure to conspecifics , we demonstrate that CMM and NCM respond to familiar vs. novel non-learned vocalizations in a manner that parallel previously reported regional responses to learned vocalizations such as conspecific songs.
