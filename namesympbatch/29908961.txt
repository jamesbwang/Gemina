  Epidemiological data from Latin America on acute<symptom> gastroenteritis<symptom> ( AGE) in the post rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine era obtained using highly sensitive molecular techniques are scarce. This prospective surveillance study was performed between March 15 , 2015 and March 19 , 2016 in two municipal health networks ( MHNs) in Cali , Colombia to detect AGE in children < 5 years of age. Consecutive sampling was performed simultaneously in all health facilities belonging to both MHNs until completion of the required sample size. Stool<symptom> samples from AGE patients were tested with a nucleic acid assay for 16 pathogens. Detection frequency and incidence rates were obtained for specific pathogens according to age-group in children with AGE leading to hospitalization or outpatient care. Overall incidence rates of AGE-related hospitalization and outpatient care were 20 and 237 per 1000 children < 5 years of age , respectively. Despite almost complete rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine uptake , rotavirus<pathogen> was the most common etiology overall , including hospitalization and outpatient treatment of 0-23-month-olds , with incidence rates of 12 and 108 per 1000 children , respectively. Norovirus<pathogen> incidence rates were similar to rotavirus<pathogen> rates in this age group and associated with high Vesikari scores. Shigella<pathogen> predominated in 24-59-month-olds. AGE remains an important cause of morbidity in children under 5 years of age , especially in those under 2 years. Rotavirus<pathogen> remains the leading AGE-associated pathogen , followed closely by norovirus<pathogen> in younger children. Preventive measures , including novel vaccination strategies , are necessary in this population to further reduce AGE-related morbidity.
