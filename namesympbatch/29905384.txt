  Adapalene 0.1 % ( ADA) with clindamycin phosphate 1.2 % ( CLNP; ADA + CLNP) and the fixed-dose combination containing CLNP and benzoyl peroxide 3 % ( CLNP/BPO 3 %) are strongly recommended for the early treatment of acne vulgaris<pathogen> in Japan. Here , we compare the early efficacy and safety of CLNP/BPO 3 % with Japanese standard topical use of ADA + CLNP in the treatment of acne vulgaris<pathogen>. In this phase IV , multicenter study , 351 patients were randomized to receive CLNP/BPO 3 % or ADA + CLNP for 12 weeks. The primary end-point was percentage change from baseline in total lesion<symptom> ( TL) counts at week 2. Secondary end-points included the percentage change from baseline in TL , inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion<symptom> ( IL and non-IL) counts , Investigator 's Static Global Assessment ( ISGA) , quality of life ( QoL ( Skindex-16)) and patient preference. Local tolerability scores and adverse events were also recorded. CLNP/BPO 3 % provided a significantly greater percentage reduction from baseline in TL compared with ADA + CLNP at week 2 , and week 4. Compared with ADA + CLNP , CLNP/BPO 3 % was superior at reducing IL ( but not non-IL) over weeks 2-12 , was more effective at improving patient QoL and ISGA , and scored higher in patient-preference assessments. Both treatments were well tolerated; adverse drug reactions occurred more frequently in patients receiving ADA + CLNP ( 37 %) than in those receiving CLNP/BPO 3 % ( 17 %). In conclusion , CLNP/BPO 3 % showed greater efficacy for the early treatment of acne vulgaris<pathogen> in Japan , with a more favorable safety profile compared with ADA + CLNP.
