  The change in milk composition in response to intramammary infusion of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) was investigated. Four clinically healthy goats were infused with LPS ( 100 Âµg) by intramammary administration to the left udder. Clinical manifestations ( rectal temperature and physical activity) , selected blood parameters ( pH and white blood cell count) and milk compositions ( somatic cell count and pH) were evaluated at 0 hr ( just before challenge) and at multiple time points over the first 24 hr post-challenge. After intramammary LPS challenge , the pH of milk from both udders increased. Thus , this study revealed that LPS-induced mastitis<symptom> in goat can result in increased pH in milk from the unchallenged ( contralateral) udder.
