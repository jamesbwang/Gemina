  The interplay between food components and gut microbiota has been considered an important factor affecting the functionality of health-promoting foods. In this study , the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus<pathogen> paracasei<pathogen> A221 on the functionality and bioavailability of kaempferol-3-o-sophroside ( KP3S) , a kaempferol-glucoside contained in kale , were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Unlike the type strain NBRC15889 , the A221 strain converted standard KP3S as well as the kaempferol-glucosides in kale extract into kaempferol ( KP). Using an intestinal barrier model , treatment with A221 significantly improved the effects of kale extract on the barrier integrity in vitro. KP , but not KP3S , clearly induced similar effects , suggesting that KP contributes to the functional improvement of the kale extract by A221. Pharmacokinetics analyses revealed that the co-administration of A221 and KP3S significantly enhanced the amount of deconjugated KP in murine plasma samples at 3 h post-administration. Finally , the oral administration of KP to Sod1-deficinet mice , which is a good mouse model of age-related disease , clearly ameliorated various pathologies , including skin thinning , fatty liver and anemia<symptom> These findings suggest that Lactobacillus<pathogen> paracasei<pathogen> A221 is effective for enhancing the anti-aging properties of kaempferol-glucosides by modulating their functionality and bioavailability through the direct bioconversion.
