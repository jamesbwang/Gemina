  On the past few years , Fish Embryo Test ( FET) became protagonist regarding the usage of `` animal-friendly '' protocols for ecotoxicological proposes. As OECD 236 FET has been widely applied on the scope of REACH ( simple mixture exposures) , but it is blindly worldwide spreading as a Whole Effluent Test ( WET)- complex mixture exposures. However , comparative peer-reviewed data regarding FET 's efficiency for WET is virtually absent. The primary objective of this paper is to compare OECD 236 with other worldwide used standard and slightly modified ecotoxicological protocols , providing a comprehensive overview of available tests for WET. For this , we used an untreated hospital effluent considered to be highly toxic but disposed on municipal sewerage. Base methods were OECD 203 ( juvenile) , USEPA 2000.0 ( larva) and OECD 236 ( embryo). Complimentarily , we evaluated the addition of three costless sublethal metrics ( Immobility , non-hatching , and pericardial<symptom> edema<symptom>) that could enhance OECD 236 sensitivity. As result we observed acute toxicity in all 8 tested methodologies , with a clear escalation in sensitivity ( Embryo â‰¤ Juvenile < Larvae<pathogen>). Larval test were the most sensitive tests for WET. Nevertheless , the addition of sublethal metrics to OECD 236 showed a positive outcome enhancing OECD 236 sensitivity in over 30 %. Thus , we conclude that OECD 236 acts below its potential and FET may not be the most sensitive life stage for WET. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
