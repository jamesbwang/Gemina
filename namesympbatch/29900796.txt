  Acute-phase reactants indicate inflammation<symptom> and are increasingly used in veterinary medicine to indicate and to monitor progression of disease. Hemostasis and inflammation<symptom> have interconnected pathophysiologic pathways and influence each other on different levels. This study established observed normal ranges for acute-phase reactants and for coagulation and thromboelastographic ( TEG) parameters in 49 dromedary camels ( Camelus dromedarius) and assessed the response to chronic and acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. Chronically infected animals suffering from lymph abscessation due to Corynebacterium<pathogen> spp. had significantly higher concentrations of the acute-phase reactants haptoglobin ( P < 0.005) and fibrinogen ( P < 0.013) and an increased clot strength characterized by an increase of the TEG parameters MA ( P < 0.039) , representing the maximum amplitude of the clot strengths , and G , the global clot strength ( P < 0.022) , compared to healthy animals. When the acute-phase and hemostatic responses of 10 males receiving a gonadotropin-releasing hormone vaccine and of 9 males that were surgically castrated over 7 days were studied , haptoglobin proved to be a minor positive acute-phase protein , with moderate levels in healthy animals. It increased significantly after both vaccination and castration and remained elevated 7 days postinsult. The negative reactant iron significantly decreased over the 7-day period after castration , whereas a similar decrease following vaccination lasted less than 3 days. Fibrinogen reacted as a positive , minor reactant , with a significant increase and a peak on days 3-5 , with higher values seen after castration. Prothrombin time showed a slight shortening at days 5-7 , and the TEG parameters MA and G showed significantly increased values , similar to fibrinogen. The acute-phase protein serum amyloid A showed poor repeatability , suggesting that the assay was not reliable.
