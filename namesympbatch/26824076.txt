  Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) are the first to identify disturbances in the immune system , recognizing pathogens such as bacteria , fungi<pathogen> , and viruses. Since the inflammation<symptom> process plays an important role in several diseases , TLRs have been considered potential therapeutic targets , including treatment for cancer. However , TLRs ' role in cancer remains ambiguous. This study aims to analyze the expression levels of plasmatic cell membrane TLRs ( TLR1 , TLR2 , TLR4 , TLR5 , and TLR6) in human astrocytomas the most prevalent tumors of CNS different grades ( II-IV). We demonstrated that TLR expressions were higher in astrocytoma samples compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. The gene and protein expressions were observed in GBM cell lines U87MG and A172 , proving their presence in the tumor cells. Associated expressions between the known heterodimers TLR1-TLR2 were found in all astrocytoma grades. In GBMs , the mesenchymal subtype showed higher levels of TLR expressions in relation to classical and proneural subtypes. A strong association of TLRs with the activation of cell cycle process and signaling through canonical , inflammasome and ripoptosome pathways was observed by in silico analysis , further highlighting TLRs as interesting targets for cancer treatment.
