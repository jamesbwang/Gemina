  Insecticides used against Aedes<pathogen> aegypti and other disease vectors can elicit a multitude of dose-dependent effects on behavioral and bionomic traits. Estimating the potential epidemiological impact of a product requires thorough understanding of these effects and their interplay at different dosages. Volatile spatial repellent ( SR) products come with an additional layer of complexity due to the potential for altered<symptom> movement<symptom> of affected mosquitoes and diffusion of volatile particles of the product beyond the treated house. Here , we propose a paired experimental design and statistical inference framework for estimating these nuanced effects of volatile SRs. We fitted a continuous-time Markov chain model in a Bayesian framework to data on marked mosquitoes released in interconnected experimental huts conducted in Iquitos , Peru. We estimated the effects of two dosages of transfluthrin on Ae. aegypti behaviors associated with human-vector contact: repellency , exiting and knockdown in the treated space and in connected , adjacent huts. We validated the framework using simulated data. The odds of a female Ae. aegypti being repelled , and thus prevented from entering a treated hut ( H Our framework is effective at elucidating multiple effects of volatile chemicals used in SR products , as well as their downstream effects. For the examined formulations of transfluthrin , we found notable dose-dependent effects on repellency , movement and knockdown that carry over to adjacent , untreated spaces.
