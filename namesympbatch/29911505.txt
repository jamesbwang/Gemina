  The ideal perioral and lip rejuvenation technique provides the longest period of efficacy , lowest complication rate , and best aesthetic results. Genetics , intrinsic aging , sun exposure and repetitive muscle<symptom> twitching<symptom> of the orbicularis oris<pathogen> produce angular , radial , and vertical lines of the perioral lines and , for this reason , the needs of patients in the treatment of this anatomical area can range from simple lip enhancement to a broader and more comprehensive treatment with simultaneous correction of perioral wrinkles. A myriad of materials have been described for rejuvenation of this area. At present , the most popular and commonly used lip enhancers are dermal fillers , but there is still no agreement on what the best material for filling soft tissue of the face , and in particular of the perioral region is. This systematic review will focus on the various dermal fillers , of different materials approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) namely poly-L-lactic acid , calcium hydroxylapatite and hyaluronic acid and also different grafts , for perioral rejuveination , with the goal of determining the optimal approach. A systematic search for English studies involving perioral rejuvenation was performed using these databases: PubMed , Google Scholar , and Ovid , using a combined keyword search or medical subject headings. At the end of our study selection process , 17 relevant publications were included. For each study , year of publication , type of material used for filling , number of patients , subject of study assessment , efficacy of the filler procedure for lips rejuvenation were analyzed.
