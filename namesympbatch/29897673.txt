  Stress is an important contributing factor in the outbreak of infectious fish diseases. To comprehensively understand the impact of catecholamine stress hormone norepinephrine ( NE) on the pathogenicity of Aeromonas<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> , we assessed variations in bacterial growth , virulence-related genes expression and virulence factors activity after NE addition in serum-SAPI medium. Further , we assessed the effects of NE on A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> virulence in vivo by challenging fish with pathogenic strain AH196 and following with or without NE injection. The NE-associated stimulation of A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> strain growth was not linear-dose-dependent , and only 100 Î¼M , or higher concentrations , could stimulate growth. Real-time PCR analyses revealed that NE notably changed 13 out of the 16 virulence-associated genes ( e.g. ompW , ahp , aha , ela , ahyR , ompA , and fur) expression , which were all significantly upregulated in A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> AH196 ( p < 0.01). NE could enhance the protease activity , but not affect the lipase activity , hemolysis<symptom> , and motility. Further , the mortality of crucian carp challenged with A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> AH196 was significantly higher in the group treated with NE ( p < 0.01). Collectively , our results showed that NE enhanced the growth and virulence of pathogenic
