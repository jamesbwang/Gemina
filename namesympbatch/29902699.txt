  Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid used as a narcotic analgesic supplement in general and regional anesthesia as well as in management of persistent , severe chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Alarming epidemiological and forensic medicine reports , accumulated mainly during the last two decades , point to a growing increase in illicit use of fentanyl , mainly in North<pathogen> America and Europe. Toxicological data indicates that fentanyl use is inextricably linked with polydrug use. There are two main sources of fentanyl on the `` recreational '' drug market. First , the most common , combines illicitly manufactured fentanyl from clandestine sources. The drug is often mixed up with heroin ( `` fake heroin '') to increase its potency at a little cost , or included in cocaine products. It can also be mixed into and sold as oxycodone- , hydrocodone- or alprazolam-containing tablets. The other way to gain fentanyl is through the diversion of fentanyl-containing medicines , especially transdermal patches ( FTPs). Fentanyl extracted from FTP can be administered intravenously , insufflated or inhaled after volatilization. The drug can also be delivered by oral or transmucosal application of the whole patch , or by rectal insertion. The most common overdose symptoms are coma<symptom> , lethargy<symptom> , respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> and arrest. Although naloxone , an opioid receptor antagonist , is the standard drug for fentanyl overdose rescue , attempts to revive patients with naloxone could be unsuccessful , due to the rapid onset of fentanyl 's action. As the fentanyl problem is constantly growing , there is an urgent need for new , effective harm-reduction strategies and technologies , as well as overdose maintenance.
