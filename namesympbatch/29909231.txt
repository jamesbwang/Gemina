  Unstable shoes were developed as a walking device to strengthen the lower extremity muscles and reduce joint loading. Many studies have reported increased muscle activity throughout the gait cycle in most of the lower limb<symptom> muscles in healthy adults using these shoes. However , no previous studies have explored the effects of wearing unstable shoes on trunk muscle activity in patients with chronic low back pain ( CLBP). Therefore , the aim of the present study was to compare the activity of selected trunk muscles in patients with CLBP during a gait test while walking wearing unstable shoes or conventional flat shoes ( control). Thirty-five CLBP patients ( 51.1 ± 12.4 y; 26 ± 3.8 kg/m2; 9.3 ± 5.2 Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score) were recruited from the Orthopedic Surgery Service at the Hospital to participate in this cross-sectional study. All the participants underwent gait analysis by simultaneously collecting surface electromyography ( EMG) data from erector spinae ( ES) , rectus<pathogen> abdominis ( RA) , obliquus internus ( OI) , and obliquus externus ( OE) muscles , while walking on a treadmill with flat control shoes or experimental unstable shoes. The results showed significantly higher % EMG activity in the ES ( mean difference: 1.8 %; 95 % CI: 1.3-2.2) , RA ( mean difference: 1.5 %; 95 % CI: 0.3-2.7) , and OI ( mean difference: 1.5 %; 95 % CI: 0.2-2.8) in the unstable versus the flat-shoe condition , with a large effect size for the ES ( Cohen 's d = 1.27). Based on these findings , the use of unstable shoes may be implicated in promoting spine stability , particularly in improving neuromuscular control of the trunk muscles in CLBP treatment.
