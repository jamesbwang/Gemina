  Mobile health interventions to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy among adolescents and young adults living with HIV<pathogen> represent a promising strategy. This pilot study ( N = 37) evaluated the psychosocial impacts of an efficacious adherence intervention , cell phone support ( CPS). Participants receiving CPS reported significant decreases in perceived stress , depression<symptom> , and illicit substance use , and increases in self-efficacy during at least one study assessment period , in comparison to participants receiving usual care. Future research using a larger sample should test for mediators of treatment efficacy to further characterize how cell phone interventions impact adherence.
