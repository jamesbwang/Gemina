  If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic make-up and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features , such as body posture<symptom> or facial expression in humans , comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors can not easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore , computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture ( RSA<pathogen>) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA<pathogen>. We have developed Root-VIS , a free software tool , which facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA<pathogen> features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore , Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We have confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS , combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo , for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana).
