  HIV<pathogen> and pathogenic SIV infection are characterized by mucosal dysfunction including epithelial barrier damage , loss of Th17 cells , neutrophil infiltration , and microbial translocation with accompanying inflammation<symptom>. However , it is unclear how and when these contributing factors occur relative to one another. In order to determine whether any of these features initiates the cycle of damage , we longitudinally evaluated the kinetics of mucosal and systemic T-cell activation , microbial translocation , and Th17 cell and neutrophil frequencies following intrarectal SIV infection of rhesus macaques. We additionally assessed the colon proteome to elucidate molecular pathways altered early after infection. We demonstrate increased T-cell activation ( HLA-DR +) beginning 3-14 days post-SIV challenge , reduced peripheral zonulin 3-14 days post-SIV , and evidence of microbial translocation 14 days post-SIV. The onset of mucosal dysfunction preceded peripheral and mucosal Th17 depletion , which occurred 14-28 days post-SIV , and gut neutrophil accumulation was not observed. Proteins involved in epithelial structure were downregulated 3 days post-SIV followed by an upregulation of immune proteins 14 days post-SIV. These data demonstrate that immune perturbations such as Th17 loss and neutrophil infiltration occur after alterations to epithelial structural protein pathways , suggesting that epithelial damage occurs prior to widespread immune dysfunction.
