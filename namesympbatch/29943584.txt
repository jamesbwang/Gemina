  Recent years have seen a change in the relative prevalence of environmental and contagious intramammary pathogens , as well as a change in the relative number of total mixed ration ( TMR)- based and pasture ( PAS)- based dairies in South Africa. The objectives of the study were to determine and compare the prevalence of mastitis<symptom> pathogens in TMR and PAS dairies in South Africa during 2008 and 2013; furthermore , the within-herd prevalence of Streptococcus<pathogen> uberis in Str. uberis-positive herds was determined and compared. The prevalence of each pathogen , as well as the within-herd prevalence of Str. uberis , were compared between the two years and the two management systems using bacterial culture results from routinely collected composite cow milk samples submitted to the Onderstepoort Milk Laboratory , Faculty of Veterinary Science , University of Pretoria. Coagulase-negative staphylococci had the highest prevalence in both TMR and PAS dairies for both 2008 ( 29.60 % ( 95.00 % CI: 28.80 %- 30.40 %) and 26.90 % ( 95.00 % CI: 25.50 %- 28.30 %) , respectively) and 2013 ( 20.20 % ( 95.00 % CI: 19.30 %- 21.10 %) and 22.70 % ( 95.00 % CI: 22.20 %- 23.10 %) , respectively) , which decreased significantly from 2008 to 2013 in both TMR and PAS dairies ( p < 0.001). Streptococcus<pathogen> uberis showed an increase in prevalence in both TMR ( p = 0.002) and PAS dairies ( p = 0.001) from 2008 ( 2.36 % ( 95.00 % CI: 2.10 %- 2.65 %) and 2.63 % ( 95.00 % CI: 2.16 %- 3.16 %) , respectively) to 2013 ( 3.10 % ( 95.00 % CI: 2.72 %- 3.51 %) and 3.64 % ( 95.00 % CI: 3.45 %- 3.83 %) , respectively). Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureusshowed a significant decrease in both TMR ( p = 0.011) and PAS ( p < 0.001) dairies from 2008 ( 4.71 % ( 95.00 % CI: 4.34 %- 5.10 %) and 5.62 % ( 95.00 % CI: 4.94 %- 6.36 %) , respectively) to 2013 ( 3.95 % ( 95.00 % CI: 3.52 %- 4.40 %) and 1.71 % ( 95.00 % CI: 1.58 %- 1.84 %) , respectively). The median within-herd prevalence of Str. uberis for the combined dairy systems showed a significant increase from 2008 ( 1.72 % ( IQR: 0.88 %- 5.00 %)) to 2013 ( 3.10 % ( IQR: 1.72 %- 4.70 %)) ( p < 0.001). Statistically significant differences were found in the prevalence of most of the major contagious and environmental mastitis<symptom> pathogens between 2008 and 2013 and between TMR and PAS dairies. The within-herd prevalence of Str. uberis increased from 2008 to 2013 , with the highest within-herd prevalence in PAS dairies in 2013.
