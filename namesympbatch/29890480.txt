  In urine-separating sanitation systems , bacterial urease enzymes can hydrolyse urea to ammonia<pathogen> during the pipe transport and storage of urine. The present study investigated whether it was possible to reduce the urine volume without losing the nitrogen as ammonia<pathogen> A method for stabilising the urine prior to dehydration<symptom> was developed. Briefly , fresh human urine was stabilised by passage through an anion-exchanger , added to an alkaline media ( wood ash or alkalised biochar) , and dehydrated. Urine dehydration<symptom> was investigated at three temperatures: 40 , 45 and 50 Â°C. The influence of various factors affecting the dehydration<symptom> process was modelled and the rate of urine dehydration<symptom> was optimised. Results indicated that 75 % ( v/v) of the urine has to pass through the ion-exchanger for alkaline stabilisation of urine to occur. At all investigated temperatures , the dehydrator accomplished > 90 % volume reduction of ion-exchanged urine , > 70 % N retention and 100 % recovery of P and K. To realise high degree of nutrient valorisation , this study proposes combining source-separation of human urine with alkaline
