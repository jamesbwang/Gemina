  Cataract surgery is associated with a variety of complications , one of which is vitreous loss. Doctors and policymakers should be aware about the precipitating factors , associations , and expected outcomes of vitreous loss. This study was , therefore , undertaken to set guidelines to improve the visual outcomes of patients. A retrospective 8-year analysis was conducted from 2007 to 2014 using the national eye database. Demographic features , ocular comorbidities , grade of surgeon , type of surgery , and the associations with the occurrence of vitreous loss , and the final visual outcomes of these patients were studied. Out of 12,992 eyes , only 3.2 % had vitreous loss , mostly aged < 40 years. Pseudoexfoliation was the only ocular comorbidity causing vitreous loss. Medical Officers and Gazetting Specialists got more vitreous loss compared to specialists. Intracapsular cataract extraction , phaco convert to extracapsular cataract extraction ( ECCE) , ECCE , and phaco all had a significant vitreous loss. Vitreous loss was the most significant intraoperative complication causing poor<symptom> vision<symptom> and resulted in impaired or poor visual outcome. Vitreous loss occurred in almost all types<pathogen> of cataract surgeries , especially by junior surgeons , among those aged < 40 years and significantly caused poor visual outcome compared to other complications. Pseudoexfoliation had higher occurrence of vitreous loss. Vitreous loss patients had impaired/poor visual outcome due to preexisting comorbidity and astigmatism. Patients at risk and junior surgeons should be closely monitored to improve outcomes. Further studies need to be done to see why and when the vitreous loss occurred.
