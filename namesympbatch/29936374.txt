  This study examined the influence of acute phase post-stroke depression<symptom> ( PSD) on various functional outcomes over 1 year after stroke. PSD was diagnosed at 2 weeks after stroke using the Mini<pathogen> International Neuropsychiatric Interview and functional outcomes were assessed via the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale , the Barthel Index , and the Mini-Mental State Examination at 2 weeks and 1 year. Acute phase PSD was an independent predictor of poor functional outcomes during both the acute and chronic phases. Considering the negative impact of PSD on stroke outcomes , identification of acute phase PSD is important for improving functional outcomes.
