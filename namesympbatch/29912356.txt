  Thirty-six newly weaned , crossbred beef steers ( 323 ± 12 kg; SD) from a single-source were used in a 56-d study to examine the effects of a Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> fermentation product ( SCFP; Original XPC , Diamond V , Cedar Rapids , IA) on total tract nutrient digestibility and response to a vaccination challenge. Twelve d after arrival , steers were blocked by body<symptom> weight ( BW) and randomly assigned to treatments: SCFP at 0 ( CON) , 14 ( SCFP14) , or 28 ( SCFP28) g · steer-1 · d-1. Steers were fed via bunks that measured individual intake and received ear tags ( CowManager , Select Sires , Plain City , OH) that recorded rumination and activity. Body weights were collected on d -1 , 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , 55 , and 56. Titanium dioxide was fed as an indigestible marker to all steers from d 12 to 27 , followed by consecutive d fecal samples , for determination of total tract nutrient digestibility. On d 34 , steers received a Mannheimia<pathogen> haemolytica<pathogen> vaccination ( One Shot , Zoetis , Kalamazoo , MI) to induce an acute phase protein ( APP) response. Blood was collected from all steers on d 34 ( prior to vaccination) and 3 , 6 , 9 , 11 , and 14 d post-vaccination. Data were analyzed using Proc Mixed of SAS ( experimental unit = steer; n = 12/treatment); the model included the fixed effect of treatment and block and the random effect of steer. Blood measures , ear tag , and dry matter intake ( DMI) data for the 15-d vaccination period were analyzed as repeated measures. Contrast statements ( CON vs. SCFP14; SCFP14 vs. SCFP28) were used to compare treatment means. Digestibility of dry matter and organic matter was greater for SCFP14 vs. SCFP28 ( P ≤ 0.03). Steers fed SCFP14 exhibited greater crude protein digestibility compared to CON ( P < 0.01). Steers fed SCFP14 exhibited greater DMI for 15 d post-vaccination ( P = 0.02) and greater ADG from d 28 to 56 ( P = 0.05) vs. SCFP28-fed steers. Post-vaccination , steers fed SCFP14 spent less time ruminating per kg of dry matter , neutral detergent fiber ( NDF) , and physically effective NDF consumed than CON or SCFP28 ( P ≤ 0.07). Serum IL-8 and haptoglobin concentrations tended to be lesser for steers fed SCFP14 vs. SCFP28 ( P ≤ 0.08). Ceruloplasmin concentrations were lesser on d 14 post-vaccination for steers fed SCFP14 vs. CON or SCFP28 ( treatment × d; P = 0.004); there were no differences on other sampling days due to treatment. Although no overall performance benefit was noted , steers fed SCFP14 responded better to a vaccination challenge vs. SCFP28-fed steers.
