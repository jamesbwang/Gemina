  The present study focuses on the utilization of green silver nanoparticles , as they are preferred for sensing applications due to their environmentally friendly nature. We have examined the optical and electrochemical sensing behavior of silver nanoparticles from Agaricus bisporus ( AgNP-AB) towards Hg ( II) ions. The AgNP-AB was prepared by microwave reactor. The synthesized AgNP was used for the sensing of Hg ( II) ions without the use of modifiers or further sophisticated instrumentation. The synthesized nanoparticles were successfully characterized by different techniques. AgNP-AB leads to aggregation with the addition of Hg ( II) ions in aqueous medium , and develops a color<symptom> change<symptom> from brown to black which leads to the formation of AgNP-AB-Hg ( II) complex<pathogen>. Moreover , the metal sensing ability of AgNP has been explored using electrochemical studies. AgNP-AB modified platinum electrode ( AgNP-AB/PE) was developed for the fast sensing of toxic Hg ( II) ions. The sensor exhibits a good limit of detection at 2.1 Ã— 10
