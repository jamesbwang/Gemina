  Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) is a known causative factor in the etiology of cervical cancer. HPV<pathogen> DNA genotyping was performed in menstrual blood ( MB) collected in napkins from patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN) , HPV<pathogen> infection and sexually active apparently normal subjects. In the same patient cohort , MB TAP1 I333V and TAP1 D637G gene polymorphisms were examined. The sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values of HPV<pathogen> DNA to detect CIN or HPV<pathogen> infection was 83 % ( 223/268) , 98 % ( 131/134) , 99 % ( 223/226) and ( 74 %) 131/176 , respectively. Moreover , HPV<pathogen> DNA was found in 24 % ( 28/118) patients who had loop electrosurgical excision procedure treatment and 0 % ( 0/76) HPV<pathogen> infected or CIN1 patient with proven recovery. On the other hand , the risk to develop high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was significantly reduced for AG and GG genotypes when compared to AA genotype and for carriers with a G allele when compared to those with an A allele for both polymorphisms. MB HPV<pathogen> DNA is a potential non-invasive marker for screening and monitoring of squamous intraepithelial lesion<symptom>. Together with TAP1 I333V and TAP1 D637G gene polymorphisms , the combined test may be useful to stratify high risk patients for better follow-up strategies. Trial number: 0378261.
