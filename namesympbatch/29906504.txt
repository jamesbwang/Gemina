  Aromatic metabolites provide the backbone for numerous industrial and pharmaceutical compounds of high value. The Phosphotransferase System ( PTS) is common to many bacteria , and is the primary mechanism for glucose uptake by Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> The PTS was removed to conserve phosphoenolpyruvate ( pep) , which is a precursor for aromatic metabolites and consumed by the PTS , for aromatic metabolite production. Replicate adaptive laboratory evolution ( ALE) of PTS and detailed omics data sets collected revealed that the PTS bridged the gap between respiration<symptom> and fermentation , leading to distinct high fermentative and high respiratory rate phenotypes. It was also found that while all strains retained high levels of aromatic amino acid ( AAA) biosynthetic precursors , only one replicate from the high glycolytic clade retained high levels of intracellular AAAs. The fast growth and high AAA precursor phenotypes could provide a starting host for cell factories targeting the overproduction aromatic metabolites.
