  Laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal ( TEP) inguinal hernia repair is a rapidly evolving , minimally invasive treatment modality for inguinal hernia. Compared with open hernia repair , this method requires a smaller incision , has cosmetic advantages , and facilitates rapid recovery and early return to daily activities because of less postoperative pain. Because general anesthesia is essential for TEP hernia repair , it can not be performed on patients who have an increased risk of developing complications when placed under general anesthesia. We report 2 cases of single-port laparoscopic TEP ( SP TEP) that were performed using only an abdominal peripheral nerve block ( PNB) at our institute. General anesthesia and neuraxial block were dangerous for both patients owing to severe heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). They were diagnosed with an inguinal hernia requiring surgery. Hence , the anesthesiologist and surgeon decided to attempt a PNB to avoid complications from general anesthesia and allow faster recovery. An ipsilateral transversus abdominis plane block as well as a rectus<pathogen> sheath block and inguinal canal block were administered via ultrasound guidance. The patients did not report any pain , and no rescue drug was administrated. The operation times were 65 and 62minutes in patients 1 and 2 , respectively. No intraoperative complications were noted. Patient 1 was discharged the day after the surgery , whereas patient 2 was discharged on the same day as the surgery. TEP hernia repair using abdominal PNB anesthesia seemed to be a safe and feasible technique without causing any additional complications. However , the use of abdominal PNB anesthesia alone for TEP hernia repair as an alternative to general anesthesia requires further investigation using a larger cohort.
