  This study aimed to compare 3-dimensional T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence ( CAIPIRINHA-volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination ( VIBE)) with 2-dimensional T1-weighted turbo<pathogen> spin-echo sequence for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) of pelvic bone metastases at 3.0 T. Thirty-one contrast-enhanced MRIs of pelvic bone metastases were included. Two contrast-enhanced sequences were evaluated for the following parameters: overall image quality , sharpness of pelvic bone , iliac vessel clarity , artifact severity , and conspicuity and edge sharpness of the smallest metastases. Quantitative analysis was performed by calculating signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the smallest metastases. Significant differences between the 2 sequences were assessed. CAIPIRINHA-VIBE had higher scores for overall image quality , pelvic bone sharpness , iliac vessel clarity , and edge sharpness of the metastatic lesions<symptom> , and had less artifacts ( all P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in conspicuity , signal-to-noise ratio , or contrast-to-noise ratio of the smallest metastases ( P > 0.05). Our results suggest that CAIPIRINHA-VIBE may be superior to turbo spin-echo for contrast-enhanced MRI of pelvic bone metastases at 3.0 T.
