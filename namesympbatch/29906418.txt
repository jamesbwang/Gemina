  The aim of this study was to verify the serum GDNF levels in individuals with anxiety<symptom> disorder ( AD) in a population-based study. This was a cross-sectional study population-based , with people aged 18 to 35. AD 's assessment was performed using the Mini<pathogen> International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( M.I.N.I). Serum GDNF was measured by ELISA using a commercial kit. The prevalence was 3.3 % for post-traumatic stress disorder , 6.7 % for panic disorders , 17 % generalized anxiety<symptom> disorder , 5.1 % for obsessive- compulsive disorder and 7.5 % for social phobia. Serum GDNF levels was higher in individuals with panic disorders ( p = 0.013) , generalized anxiety<symptom> ( p = 0.035) , obsessive- compulsive disorder ( p = 0.005) and social phobia ( p = 0.004) , when compared to individuals without ADs. Only post traumatic stress disorder is not associated with serum GDNF levels ( p = 0.119). In this paper , we observed increased serum levels of GDNF in individuals with anxiety<symptom> disorders , suggesting that this biomarker can be used as a putative marker for AD 's. The knowledge of the physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> related to anxiety<symptom> disorders can provide a better understanding of AD 's pathogenesis , as well as , mechanisms involved in the progression of this condition.
