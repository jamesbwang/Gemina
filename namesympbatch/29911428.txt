  HIV<pathogen> self-stigma in HIV<pathogen> positive men who have sex with men ( HIVMSM) has been identified as one of the largest challenges of HIV<pathogen> prevention , and associates with numerous negative outcomes , including depression<symptom> , decreased social support , and less condom use intentions. In the present study , 321 HIVMSM in Chengdu , China were recruited to examine the prevalence of condom use in the past months and intentions to use condoms in next six months; we also identify pathways between HIV<pathogen> self-stigma and intentions to use condoms by the structural equation modeling approach. Results showed that Chinese HIVMSM had the suboptimal prevalence of consistent condom use and low intentions to use condoms consistently. Additionally , depression<symptom> and decreased social support were significant mediators between HIV<pathogen> self-stigma and condom use intentions. The complex pathways between HIV<pathogen> self-stigma and intentions to use condoms should be taken into account in the HIV<pathogen> prevention and intervention programs.
