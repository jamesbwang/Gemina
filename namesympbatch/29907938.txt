  The gut microbes of dairy cows are strongly associated with their health , but the relationship between milk<symptom> production<symptom> and the intestinal microbiota has seldom been studied. Thus , we explored the diversity of the intestinal microbiota during peak lactation of dairy cows. The intestinal microbiota of nine dairy cows at peak lactation was evaluated using the Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time ( PacBio SMRT) sequencing approach. A total of 32,670 high-quality 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained , belonging to 12 phyla , 59 families , 107 genera , and 162 species. Firmicutes ( 83 %) were the dominant phylum , while Bacteroides<pathogen> ( 6.16 %) was the dominant genus. All samples showed a high microbial diversity , with numerous genera of short chain fatty acid ( SCFA)- producers. The proportion of SCFA producers was relatively high in relation to the identified core intestinal microbiota. Moreover , the predicted functional metagenome was heavily involved in energy metabolism. This study provided novel insights into the link between the dairy cow gut microbiota and
