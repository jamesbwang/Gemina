  HIV<pathogen> infection is associated with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> states , including sensory neuropathy , which affects greater than 40 % of patients. To determine the impact of HIV-Tat induction on nociceptive behaviour in female mice conditionally expressing HIV<pathogen> Tat Intraepidermal nerve fibre density was significantly reduced after 6 weeks of Tat induction , similar to sensory neuropathy seen in clinical HIV<pathogen> infection. Tat induction through DOX caused a significant reduction in paw withdrawal thresholds in a time-dependent manner starting the 4th week after Tat induction. No changes in paw withdrawal latencies were seen in Tat (-) control mice lacking the These results suggest that Tat protein contributes to painful HIV-related sensory neuropathy during the initial stages of the pathogenesis.
