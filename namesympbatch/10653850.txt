  Atherosclerosis is one of the predominant causes of cardiovascular disease ( CVD). Several studies indicated the significant pathophysiological role of salusin-β in atherosclerosis. Cytokines are involved in all stages of atherosclerosis. Therefore , we aimed to assess the effect of salusin-β on interleukin 6 ( IL-6) , interleukin 8 ( IL-8) , interleukin 18 ( IL-18) ( as inflammatory cytokines) and interleukin 1Ra ( IL-1Ra) ( as anti-inflammatory cytokines) levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs). The HUVECs were cultured in HUVEC completed medium<pathogen> and treated with different doses of salusin-β for 6 and 12 hours. For the investigation of nuclear factor ƙβ ( NF-ƙβ) signaling pathway involvement , cells were treated in the presence or absence of Bay 11-7082 ( as NF-ƙβ inhibitor). The mRNA expression and protein level of cytokines were measured by a real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) system and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) method , respectively. Salusin-β increased mRNA expression and protein level of IL-6 , IL-8 and IL-18. This protein decreased mRNA and protein level of IL-1Ra in HUVECs. NF-ƙβ signaling pathway was involved in the up-regulatory effect of salusin-β on mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The down-regulatory effect of salusin-β on IL-1Ra expression could not be influenced by Bay 11-7082 pre-treatment. It seems that salusin-β may participate in a cascade pathway in vascular inflammation<symptom>. Our findings suggested that salusin-β has potential use as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.
