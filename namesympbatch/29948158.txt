  Ectoine ( ECT) is a compatible solute synthesized mostly by halophilic microorganisms subjected to various stressful factors. Its protective properties in bacteria and some populations of isolated cells subjected to different stressors are reported; however , little is known on its effects against a commonly used compound , ethanol ( ETH). The purpose of our study was to determine the effects of ETH alone ( at 20 and 60 g/L) and in the combination with various concentrations of ECT ( 5 , 10 , and 25 mg/L) at various times of exposure on behavioural , physiological , and biochemical parameters of a model invertebrate Daphnia magna<pathogen>. In the present study , we determined the following parameters: immobilisation , heart rate , thoracic limb<symptom> movement<symptom> , catalase ( CAT) activity , and nitric oxide species ( NO
