  Industrial waste dumps are rarely colonized by vegetation after they have been abandoned , indicating biological infertility<symptom>. Revegetation of industrial tailings dumps is thus necessary to prevent wind erosion , metal leaching and has been shown to restore soil functions and ecosystem services. However , little is known about the microbial colonization and community structure of vegetated tailings following the application of restoration technologies. In this study , we investigated the rhizosphere and phyllosphere bacterial communities of a poplar tree plantation within a phytomanagement-based restoration program of a Hg-contaminated site. We used Illumina-based sequencing combined with culture-dependent approaches to describe plant-associated bacterial communities and to isolate growth-promoting bacteria ( PGPB) and Hg-resistant bacteria. The genus Streptomyces<pathogen> was highly specific to the root community , accounting for 24.4 % of the relative abundance but only representing 0.8 % of the soil community , whereas OTUs from the Chloroflexi phylum were essentially detected in the soil community. Aboveground habitats were dominated by bacteria from the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum , which were not detected in belowground habitats. Leaf and stem habitats were characterized by several dominant OTUs , such as those from the phylum Firmicutes in the stems or from the genera Methylobacterium<pathogen> , Kineococcus , Sphingomonas and Hymenobacter in the leaves. Belowground habitats hosted more cultivable Hg-resistant bacteria than aboveground habitats and more Hg-resistant bacteria were found on the episphere than in endospheric habitats. Hg-resistant isolates exhibiting plant growth-promoting ( PGP) traits , when used as inoculants of Capsicum annuum , were shown to increase its root dry biomass but not Hg concentration. The N
