  The current opioid crisis highlights an urgent need for better paradigms for prevention and treatment of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and addiction. Although many approach this complex<pathogen> clinical condition with the question , `` Is this pain or is this addiction? , '' it is more than the sum of its parts. Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> among those with dependence and addiction often evolves into a complex disabling condition with pain at multiple sites , psychosocial dysfunctions , medical and psychiatric disorders , polypharmacy , and polysubstance use , all interacting with each other in complex ways ( multimorbidity). The authors offer an integrative therapeutic approach to manage this complex clinical scenario.
