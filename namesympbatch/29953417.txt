  The microbiome is defined as the collective genomes of the microbes ( composed of bacteria , bacteriophage , fungi<pathogen> , protozoa and viruses) that colonize the human body , and alterations have been associated with a number of disease states. Changes in gut commensals can influence the neurologic system via the brain-gut axis , and systemic insults such as trauma or traumatic brain injury ( TBI) may alter the gut microbiome. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gut microbiome in a pre-clinical TBI cortical impact model. Male rats underwent craniotomy and randomized to a sham group ( n = 4) , or a moderate TBI ( n = 10) using a pneumatic impactor. MRI and behavioral assessments were performed pre-TBI and on days 2 , 7 and 14 days thereafter. Microbiome composition was determined with 16 s rRNA sequencing from fecal sample DNA pre-TBI and 2 hrs , 1 , 3 , and 7 days afterwards. Alpha- and β- bacterial diversity , as well as organizational taxonomic units ( OTUs) were determined. Significant changes in the gut microbiome were evident as early as 2 hrs after TBI as compared to pre-injured samples and sham rats. While there were varying trends among the phylogenetic families across time , some changes persisted through 7 days in the absence of therapeutic intervention. While large structural lesions<symptom> and behavioral deficits were apparent post-TBI , there were modest but significant decreases in α-diversity. Moreover , both changes in representative phyla and α-diversity measures were significantly correlated with MRI-determined lesion<symptom> volume. These results suggest that changes in the microbiome may represent a novel biomarker to stage TBI severity and predict functional outcome.
