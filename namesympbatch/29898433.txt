  Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) is an important etiological factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs). Standard treatment of HPV-positive tumors with platinum-based radio ( chemo) therapy results in a better outcome than in HPV-negative tumors. Electrochemotherapy is becoming an increasingly recognized mode of treatment in different cancers; thus , its use in the management of head and neck SCC is of considerable interest. However , response to electrochemotherapy according to HPV<pathogen> status of the tumors has not been evaluated yet. Thus , our aim was to compare the effect of electrochemotherapy with cisplatin or bleomycin between HPV-negative and HPV-positive human pharyngeal<symptom> SCC derived cell lines and tumor models. HPV-positive cells and tumors were found to be more sensitive to electrochemotherapy with cisplatin than HPV-negative ones , whereas sensitivity to electrochemotherapy with bleomycin was similar irrespective of the HPV<pathogen> status. The higher sensitivity of HPV-positive cells and tumors to electrochemotherapy with cisplatin is likely due to the higher level and slower repair of DNA damage. In HPV-negative tumors , a higher number of complete responses was recorded after bleomycin-based rather than cisplatin-based electrochemotherapy , while in HPV-positive tumors electrochemotherapy with cisplatin was more effective.
