  Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor receptor-associated factor 6 ( TRAF6) acts as a central intracellular signal adapter molecule that mediates the tumor necrosis<symptom> factor receptor superfamily and the interleukin-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor family in vertebrates and invertebrates. In the present study , HcTRAF6 , a molluscan homologue of TRAF6 from Hyriopsis cumingii , has been cloned and identified. The entire open reading frame of HcTRAF6 was found to comprise a 1965-bp region that encodes a predicted protein of 654 amino acids , which contains conserved characteristic domains including a RING domain , two TRAF-type zinc finger domains , a typical coiled coil and the MATH domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HcTRAF6 was aggregated closely with CsTRAF6 from Cyclina sinensis<pathogen> in the invertebrate cluster of mollusks. Further , qRT-PCR analysis showed that HcTRAF6 mRNA was extensively distributed in mussel tissues with a high expression in gills. After immune stimulation with Aeromonas<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> and lipopolysaccharides , the transcription of HcTRAF6 was obviously induced in the gills and hemocytes. In addition , significant fluctuation in HcTRAF6 expression was observed in the pearl sac , gills and hemocytes after mantle implantation. These findings confirmed its role in the alloimmune response. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that over-expression of HcTRAF6 could enhance the activity of the NF-ÎºB reporter in a dose-dependent manner. Further , the RNA interference showed that the up-regulation of antimicrobial peptides in anti-bacterial infection was strongly suppressed in HcTRAF6-silenced mussels and that depletion of HcTRAF inhibited the elimination of A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen>. All these findings together prove that HcTRAF6 functions as an efficient regulator in innate immune mechanisms against invading pathogens and the alloimmune mechanism after mantle implantation in H. cumingii.
