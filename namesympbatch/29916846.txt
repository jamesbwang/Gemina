  To provide a summary of the contributions of mathematical modeling to understanding of HIV<pathogen> persistence during antiretroviral therapy. Although HIV<pathogen> persistence during therapy could be caused by continual viral replication or slow-decaying latent infection , most evidence points toward the latter mechanism. The latent reservoir is maintained by a balance<symptom> of cell death , proliferation , and reactivation , and new methods to estimate the relative contributions of these rates use a wide range of experimental data. This has led to new quantitative predictions about the potential benefit of therapies such as latency-reversing agents or antiproliferative drugs. Results of these mathematical modeling studies can be used to design and interpret future trials of new therapies targeting HIV<pathogen> persistence.
