  We report a case of ceftriaxone-resistant Aeromonas<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> infection in a 32-year-old man after medicinal leech therapy. The patient underwent a free gracilis<pathogen> muscle flap for dorsal foot soft tissue reconstruction. Because of persistent congestion<symptom> after venous revision , medicinal leech therapy was initiated to aid in flap salvage. Intravenous ceftriaxone was administered prior to application of leeches for prophylaxis against A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen>. Leech therapy was discontinued after 1 week , and ceftriaxone was discontinued 24 hours thereafter. An infection developed despite being on appropriate antibiotics. Culture sensitivities indicated that A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> was resistant to ceftriaxone.
