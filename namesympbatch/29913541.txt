  To assess the cost-effectiveness of carbetocin versus oxytocin for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> ( PPH) due to uterine atony after vaginal delivery/cesarean section in women with risk factors for bleeding. A decision tree was developed for vaginal delivery and another one for cesarean , in which a sequential analysis of the results was obtained with the use of carbetocin and oxytocin for prevention of PPH and related consequences. A third-party payer perspective was used; only direct medical costs were considered. Incremental costs and effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs) were evaluated for a one-year time horizon. The costs were expressed in 2016 Colombian pesos ( 1 USD = 3,051 Col<pathogen> $). In the vaginal delivery model , the average cost of care for a patient receiving prophylaxis with uterotonic agents was Col<pathogen> $ 347,750 with carbetocin and Col<pathogen> $ 262,491 with oxytocin , while the QALYs were 0.9980 and 0.9979 , respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is above the cost-effectiveness threshold adopted by Colombia. In the model developed for cesarean section , the average cost of a patient receiving prophylaxis with uterotonics was Col<pathogen> $ 461,750 with carbetocin , and Col<pathogen> $ 481,866 with oxytocin , and the QALYs were 0.9959 and 0.9926 , respectively. Carbetocin has lower cost and is more effective , with a saving of Col<pathogen> $ 94,887 per avoided hemorrhagic event. In case of elective cesarean delivery , carbetocin is a dominant alternative in the prevention of PPH compared with oxytocin; however , it presents higher costs than oxytocin , with similar effectiveness , in cases of vaginal delivery.
