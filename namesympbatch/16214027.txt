  Inflammation<symptom> can profoundly impact motivated behavior , as is the case with inflammation-induced depression<symptom> By evaluating objectively measurable basic neurobehavioral processes involved in motivation , recent research indicates that inflammation<symptom> generally reduces approach motivation and enhances avoidance motivation. Increased effort valuation largely mediates the effects of inflammation<symptom> on approach motivation. Changes in reward valuation are not uniformly observed in approach motivation. However , inflammation<symptom> increases the averseness of negative stimuli. Within the context of both approach and avoidance motivation , inflammation<symptom> appears to enhance the contrast between concurrently presented stimuli. While changes in both approach and avoidance motivation appear to be mediated by midbrain dopaminergic neurotransmission to the ventral striatum<pathogen> , it is unclear if the enhanced contrast is mediated by the same system.
