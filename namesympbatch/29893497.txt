  Biofilms , composed of bacterial cells embedded in a secreted polysaccharide and protein matrix , often cause problems such as chronic and refractory infections. Staphylococcus<pathogen> pseudintermedius , which is an important pathogen in veterinary medicine , has a high rate of biofilm production. Although it is considered that S. pseudintermedius biofilms are associated with prolonged inflammatory disorders , there are no reports that S. pseudintermedius biofilm directly regulates inflammatory reactions. In this study , we focused on the metabolites derived from biofilm cultures of S. pseudintermedius and evaluated their inflammatory effects in vitro. Expression levels of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 mRNA significantly increased in RAW264 .7 cells that were cultured with biofilm-conditioned medium ( BCM). The secreted proteins in BCM were heat resistance and activated a Toll-like receptor ( TLR) signalling pathway. Moreover , based on SDS-PAGE analysis , isolates with stronger biofilm-forming capabilities induced more inflammatory reactions and had specific banding patterns compared with those of weak biofilm producers. Collectively , our results suggest that the proteins derived from S. pseudintermedius biofilm induce a host inflammatory response via a TLR pathway. Furthermore , the severity of inflammation<symptom> depends on the biofilm formation capacity of the S. pseudintermedius strain.
