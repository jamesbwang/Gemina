  Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) is a DNA virus linked to mucosal and cutaneous carcinogenesis. More than 200 different HPV<pathogen> types exist. We carried out a transversal study to investigate the prevalence of HPV<pathogen> types in two regions of Mexico. A total of 724 genital and non-genital samples from women ( F) and men ( M) were studied; 241 ( 33 %) from North-Eastern ( NE) and 483 ( 66 %) from South-Central ( SC) Mexico. The overall prevalence was 87 %. In genital lesions<symptom> from females , the NE group showed a prevalence of HPV<pathogen> types 16 ( 37 %) , 6 ( 13 %) , 59 ( 6 %) , 11 , 18 and 66 ( 5.4 % each); and the SC group showed types 6 ( 17 %) , 16 ( 15 %) , 11 ( 14.5 %) , 18 ( 12 %) and 53 ( 6 %). In the genital lesions<symptom> from males , NE group showed types 16 ( 38 %) , 6 ( 21 %) , 11 ( 13 %) and 59 plus 31 ( 7.5 %) and the SC group showed types 6 ( 25 %) , 11 ( 22 %) , 18 ( 17 %) and 16 ( 11.5 %). When the two regions were compared , a higher prevalence of low-risk HPV<pathogen> 6 and 11 was found in the SC region and of high-risk HPV<pathogen> 59 , 31 and 66 ( the latter can also be present in benign lesions<symptom>) in the NE region. Our findings complement efforts to understand HPV<pathogen> demographics as a prerequisite to guide and assess the impact of preventive interventions.
