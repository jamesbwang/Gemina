  Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis<pathogen> is characterized by multiple air-filled cysts<symptom> in the intestine wall. A perforation causes pneumoperitoneum , frequently with minimal clinical affectation and do not require surgery at first in most cases. Recently , some cancer treatments , mainly molecular targeted therapy , have been associated with this complication. For this reason , radiologic findings of intestinal pneumatosis and/or secondary perforation during patient follow-up should be carefully interpreted. The clinical-analytical findings should always be considered. We report a case associated with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in order to illustrate this point.
