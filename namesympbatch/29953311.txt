  Poxvirus infections have been reported in domestic , captive , and wild avian hosts including many raptor species. A wild Common Buzzard ( Buteo buteo) admitted to a wildlife veterinary clinic in Sardinia , Italy , showed multiple , wart-like proliferative cutaneous lesions<symptom> on both legs. Histologically , there was ballooning degeneration and large intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies consistent with avipoxvirus ( APV) infection. Diagnosis was confirmed by PCR detecting APV genes: P4b ( locus fpv167) , P35 ( locus fpv140) , and partial DNA polymerase. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to compare the detected virus<pathogen> with a panel of selected APVs. Analyses of P4b and DNA polymerase assigned the virus<pathogen> to clade A ( fowlpox virus , FWPV) , subclade A7 , grouping with many other APVs previously isolated in birds of prey. Further research should highlight the diversity of avian pox viral strains circulating among common buzzards as well as the phylogenetic role of locus fpv140 ( P35) in comparison with the more-conserved P4b and DNA polymerase genes.
