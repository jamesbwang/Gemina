  Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> ( CRAB) infections are an increasing concern in intensive care units ( ICUs) worldwide. The combination of carbapenemases and 16S rRNA-methyltransferases ( 16S-RMTases) further reduces the therapeutic options. OXA-carbapenemase/A. baumannii<pathogen> clone tandems in Latin America have already been described; however , no information exists in this region regarding the occurrence of 16S-RMTases in this microorganism. In addition , the epidemiology of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> in ICUs and its associated resistance profiles are poorly understood. Our objectives were as follows: to study the clonal relationship and antibiotic resistance profiles of clinical and digestive colonizing A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> isolates in an ICU , to characterize the circulating carbapenemases , and to detect 16S-RMTases. Patients admitted between August 2010 and July 2011 with a clinically predicted hospital stay > 48 hr were included. Pharyngeal<symptom> and rectal swabs were obtained during the first fortnight after hospitalization. Resistance profiles were determined with MicroScan
