  Acute spontaneous bullous urticaria is an extremely rare entity , and there are few reports with blister formation in acute urticaria patients. We present a two-year old girl who was admitted for bullous spontaneous acute urticaria; the underlying reason for this was not detected. Nikolsky 's sign and Darrier 's sign were negative. Lesions<symptom> were not compatible with erythema multiforme<pathogen>. However , biopsy was not allowed to be performed. Because of this , the underlying pathogenesis could not be clarified. She was recovered by a short course of antihistamine and systemic steroid , and the lesions<symptom> did not recur during two-year follow-up. Short term systemic steroid in addition to oral antihistamines resulted in prompt recovery in a patient with acute urticaria complicated by bullae.
