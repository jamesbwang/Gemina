  Propionibacterium<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> has been recognized as a main target for medical treatment of acne since this bacterium<pathogen> promotes acne inflammation<symptom> by inducing upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines production , resulting in an accumulation of neutrophils and oxygen-free radicals produced by neutrophils within acne lesion<symptom>. The aims of this study were to evaluate the biological activities of Mangifera indica<pathogen> kernel extracts grown in Northern Thailand ( Kaew-Moragot cultivar) , related to anti-acne properties including antimicrobial effect against acne-inducing bacteria together with the first elucidation of the mechanism of action against Propionibacterium<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> , anti-oxidation , and anti-inflammation. The kernels of M. indica<pathogen> , obtained from raw and ripe fruits , were macerated using various solvents. Agar diffusion and broth microdilution methods were performed to investigate the antibacterial activities of the extracts against P. acnes<pathogen> , Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , and Staphylococcus<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen> The ethanolic fractions exhibited the strongest antimicrobial effect against P. acnes with minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of 1.56 mg/mL and 12.50 mg/mL , respectively. Bactericidal effect against P. acnes<pathogen> of these extracts could be observed after 3 h of incubation from time-kill curve. The chromatograms of high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the extracts existed gallic acid with high total phenolic content. These extracts additionally showed strong free radical scavenging properties on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH) and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid ( ABTS) as well as a notable inhibitory effect on linoleic acid peroxidation , which highly correlated to their antimicrobial effect , total phenolic , and gallic acid contents. The images , studied through using transmission electron microscopy , revealed that the extract certainly disrupted P. acnes cell membrane after exposure for 1 h as well as induced the consequent leakage of cytoplasmic materials. The inhibitory effects of the extracts on IL-8 secretion from LPS-inducing RAW 264.7 cells were also presented. In conclusion , the kernel extracts of raw M. indica<pathogen> fruit were effective against aerobic and anaerobic acne-inducing bacteria particularly P. acnes<pathogen> and exerted antioxidant along with anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore , the extracts might be potential agents for inflammatory acne treatment. However , clinical study is needed for further investigation.
