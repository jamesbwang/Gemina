  Poly ( ethylene terephtalate) ( PET)- based materials face general biofouling issues that we addressed by grafting a copolymer of glycidyl methacrylate and sulfobetaine methacrylate , poly ( GMA- r-SBMA). The grafting procedure involved a dip-coating step followed by UV-exposure and led to successful grafting of the copolymer as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements. It did not modify the pore size nor the porosity of the PET membranes<symptom>. In addition , their surface hydrophilicity was considerably improved , with a water contact angle falling to 30 ° in less than 20 s and 0 ° in less than 1 min. The effect of copolymer concentration in the coating bath ( dip-coating procedure) and UV exposure time ( UV step) were scrutinized during biofouling studies involving several bacteria such as Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Stenotrophomonas<pathogen> maltophilia<pathogen> , but also whole blood and HT1080 fibroblasts cells. The results indicate that if all conditions led to improved biofouling mitigation , due to the efficiency of the zwitterionic copolymer and grafting procedure , a higher concentration ( 15 mg/mL) and longer UV exposure time ( at least 10 min) enhanced the grafting density which reflected on the biofouling results and permitted a better general biofouling control regardless of the nature of the biofoulant ( bacteria , blood cells , fibroblasts).
