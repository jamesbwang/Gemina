  The pathogenesis of respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( RSV<pathogen>) in older adults may be due to age-related T-cell immunosenescence. Thus , we evaluated CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses during RSV<pathogen> infection in adults across the age spectrum. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected during RSV<pathogen> infection in adults , age 26-96 years , were stimulated with live RSV<pathogen> and peptide pools representing F , M , NP , and G proteins and analyzed by flow cytometry. There were no significant age-related differences in frequency of CD4 + T cells synthesizing interferon ( IFN) γ , interleukin ( IL) 2 , IL4 , IL10 , or tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) α or in CD8 + IFNγ + T cells. IL4 + CD4 + T-cell numbers were low , as were IL13 and IL17 responses. However , in univariate analysis , CD4 T-cell IFNγ , IL2 , IL4 , IL10 , and TNFα responses and CD8 + IFNγ + T cells were significantly increased with more severe illness requiring hospitalization. In multivariate analysis , viral load was also associated with increased T-cell responses. We found no evidence of diminished RSV-specific CD4 or CD8 T-cell responses in adults infected with RSV<pathogen>. However , adults with severe disease seemed to have more robust CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses during infection , suggesting that disease severity may have a greater association with T-cell responses than age.
