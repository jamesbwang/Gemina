  The ability of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria ( PGPR) to enhance Lathyrus sativus tolerance to lead ( Pb) stress was investigated. Ten consortia formed by mixing four efficient and Pb-resistant PGPR strains were assessed for their beneficial effect in improving Pb ( 0.5 mM) uptake and in inducing the host defence system of L. sativus under hydroponic conditions based on various physiological and biochemical parameters. Lead stress significantly decreased shoot ( SDW) and root ( RDW) dry weight , but PGPR inoculation improved both dry weights , with highest increases in SDW and RDW of plants inoculated with I5 ( R. leguminosarum ( M5) + P.<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> ( K23) + Luteibacter sp. + Variovorax sp.) and I9 ( R. leguminosarum ( M5) + Variovorax sp. + Luteibacter sp. + S. meliloti) by 151 % and 94 % , respectively. Additionally , inoculation significantly enhanced both chlorophyll and soluble sugar content , mainly in I5 inoculated leaves by 238 % and 71 % , respectively , despite the fact that Pb decreased these parameters. We also found that PGPR inoculation helps to reduce oxidative damage and enhances antioxidant enzyme activity , phenolic compound biosynthesis , carotenoids and proline content. PGPR inoculation increased Pb uptake in L. sativus , with highest increase in shoots of plants inoculated with I5 and I7 , and in roots and nodules<symptom> of plants inoculated with I1. Moreover , PGPR inoculation enhanced mineral homeostasis for Ca , Cu and Zn under Pb stress , mainly in plants inoculated with I1 , I5 , I7 and I9. Results of our study suggest the potential of efficient and Pb-resistant PGPR in alleviating harmful effects of metal stress via activation of various defence mechanisms and enhancing Pb uptake that promotes tolerance of L. sativus to Pb stress.
