  Cases of wart-like lesions<symptom> in humans and dromedary camels occurred in eastern Sudan in 2015 were described. Involvement of papillomavirus<pathogen> ( PV) in causing these cases was affirmed by PCR and immunoperoxidase test. Mostly , the lesions<symptom> were observed on the skin of the chest and forearms in addition to lips and mandible. Sequence analysis revealed Camelus dromedarius PV types 1 and 2 genotypes as the causative genotypes. We also observed cases of wart-like lesions<symptom> on hands and legs of two herders attending the infected camel herd. Partial genome sequencing revealed human PV type 2 in one of the two human samples providing no indications for interspecies transmission of camel PVs , yet provides , for the first time evidence of active circulation of this virus in eastern Sudan.
