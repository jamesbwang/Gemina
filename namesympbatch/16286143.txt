  Partial penectomy ( glansectomy with/or without distal corporectomy) is an acceptable alternative for smaller distal pT3 penile carcinoma lesions<symptom> in highly motivated and compliant patients. The authors describe a novel technique of neo-glans reconstruction using a tunica vaginalis<pathogen> ( TV) testis allograft. However , due to an unclear resection margin on final histology , the patient underwent re-do surgery with a neo-glans revision using the well-established mesh split-thickness skin graft ( STSG) technique. The penile length was preserved and the penile and bulbar part of the urethra was additionally mobilised in order to obtain a natural and aesthetic result for the meatus. Neo-glans reconstruction with TV coverage may be another promising alternative , which certainly requires further evaluation. We believe that the donor-site associated morbidity is minimal when compared to other harvesting sites. However , this is just an assumption , because direct comparison data on grafting techniques and neo-glans reconstruction are not available. Nevertheless , we think that for re-do procedures a standardised approach using a STSG technique should be the treatment method of choice.
