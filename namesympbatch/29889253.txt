  To relate in vivo behavior of fascicle segments within a muscle<symptom> to their in vitro force-length relationships , we examined the strain behavior of paired segments within each of three vertebrate muscles. After determining in vivo muscle activity patterns and length changes of in-series segments within the semimembranosus muscle in the American Toad ( Bufo americanus) during hopping and within the sternohyoid muscle in the rat ( Rattus<pathogen> rattus<pathogen>) during swallowing , and of spatially separated fascicles within the medial gastrocnemius muscle in the rat during trotting , we measured their corresponding in vitro ( toad) or in situ ( rat) force-length relationships. For all three muscles , in vivo strain heterogeneity lasted for about 36 to 57 % of the behavior cycle , during which one segment or fascicle shortened while the other segment or fascicle simultaneously lengthened. In the toad semimembranosus muscle , the proximal segment shortened from the descending limb across the plateau of its force-length relationship from 1.12 to 0.91 of its optimal length ( Lo) , while the distal segment lengthened ( by 0.04 Â± 0.04 Lo) before shortening down the ascending limb from 0.94 to 0.83 Lo. In the rat sternohyoid muscle , the proximal segment tended to shorten on its ascending limb from 0.90 to 0.85 L0 while the distal segment tended to lengthen across L0 ( 0.96 to 1.12 L0). In the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle , in vivo strains of proximal fascicles ranged from 0.72 to 1.02 Lo , while the distal fascicles ranged from 0.88 to 1.11 L0. Even though the timing of muscle activation patterns were similar between segments , the heterogeneous strain patterns of fascicle segments measured in vivo coincided with different operating ranges across their force-length relationships simultaneously , implying differences in force-velocity behavior as well. The three vertebrate skeletal muscles represent a diversity of fiber architectures and functions and suggest that patterns of in vivo contractile strain and the operating range over the force-length relationship in one muscle region does not necessarily represent other regions within the same muscle.
