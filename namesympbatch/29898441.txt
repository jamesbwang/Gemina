  We aimed to assess potential associations between atypical squamous cell ( ASC) subgroups: ASC-US ( undetermined significance) and ASC-H ( can not exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion<symptom>) , regarding cytomorphological features , high-risk ( HR) human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) testing , and histological outcomes in a sample of Brazilian women. Cross-sectional study which evaluated 1,346 liquid-based cytologies between January 2010 and July 2016 with ASC results. ASC-US and ASC-H were analyzed for frequency , diagnostic criteria , and cytological findings and compared with HR-HPV tests and histological outcomes. Enlarged nucleus was the most frequent ASC-US criterion , but alternative criteria were present in 20 % of the total cases. No ASC-US criteria were associated with histological outcomes or HR-HPV positivity. Parakeratosis , corneal pearl , giant cells , and binucleation were strongly associated with ASC-US while hyperkeratosis was associated with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions<symptom> ( HSIL) or a superior outcome. HR-HPV was positive in 64.39 % of ASC-US and 65.38 % of ASC-H. HSIL or superior outcomes also occurred in 13.33 % of ASC-US and 64.71 % of ASC-H cases. Alternative criteria for ASC-US were relatively frequent. Reactive cellular changes suggestive of atypias were more abundant in ASC-US. Although ASC-H is associated with worse histological outcomes , no differences in HPV<pathogen> positivity were found in comparison to ASC-US.
