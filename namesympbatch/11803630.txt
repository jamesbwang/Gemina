  Submucosal hematoma has never been associated with caustic injuries. Long-term follow-up of patients who ingested ammonia<pathogen> is not well known and ammonia<pathogen> ingestion is rare. In a Single-center observational study , prospective data were collected from 2009 to 2013 , in patients over the age of 14 years old referred for ammonia<pathogen> ingestion. The emergency and follow-up endoscopic data and the outcome were reported. Ammonia<pathogen> ingestion occurred in 43 patients. Submucosal hematoma of the gastric wall was a distinctive endoscopic sign observed in 15 ( 34.8 %) cases. Oropharyngeal lesions<symptom> were present in 30 ( 69.8 %) patients , which was associated with ingestion with suicidal intent in 18 cases. Mild and severe endoscopic lesions<symptom> ( grade IIB to IIIB<pathogen>) were found in 16 ( 37.2 %) cases with 10 ( 23.3 %) cases presenting submucosal hematoma at initial endoscopy. A complete spontaneous gastric healing was frequently observed in 36 ( 83.7 %) cases. In 11 cases with submucosal hematoma , a favourable outcome was observed with a medical treatment , however 6 of these patients had severe endoscopic lesions<symptom> initially. Submucosal hematoma of the gastric wall is an endoscopic sign occurring frequently in ammonia<pathogen> ingestion. Submucosal hematoma should be distinguished from necrosis<symptom> in order to avoid false misclassification in favour of more severe<symptom> lesions<symptom> , which would lead to an abusive surgery.
