  Convex endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration ( C-EBUS-TBNA) has become an essential modality for diagnosis and staging of hilar , mediastinal , and central pulmonary<symptom> lesions<symptom>. A Trans-thoracic pleural biopsy is the accepted practice for diagnosing pleural nodules<symptom>. However , the diagnostic yield of a pleural biopsy is limited and surgical procedures pose a greater risk. We report a unique case of using a C<pathogen>- EBUS scope for the diagnosis of pleural nodules<symptom> and mediastinal lymph node metastasis in a man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
