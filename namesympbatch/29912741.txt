  This study sought to analyze outcomes in patients with moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation ( TR) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR). The consequences of uncorrected significant TR in patients undergoing TAVR remain undefined. Between 2009 and 2014 , 369 patients underwent TAVR at our institution , and 58 of these had baseline moderate-severe TR. Preoperative , 30-day , and 1-year transthoracic echocardiograms were analyzed. Predictors of persistent TR at 30 days and survival were assessed. Fifty-eight patients with baseline moderate-severe TR underwent TAVR. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement resulted in significant reductions in pulmonary artery pressures and TR severity ( 100 % vs 64 %; P < 0.001) at 30 days. This was sustained at 1 year and was associated with significant improvements in stroke volume index and New<pathogen> York Heart Association functional class. No changes in right ventricular function or size were noted. The only independent predictor of persistent moderate-severe TR at 30 days was preoperative atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF; odds ratio ( OR) , 4.56; 95 % confidence interval , 1.1-18.3; P = 0.033). Independent predictors of overall long-term survival included AF ( OR , 0.41; P = 0.001) and chronic lung disease ( OR , 0.47; P = 0.011) , but not baseline moderate-severe TR. In patients with baseline moderate-severe TR , persistent moderate-severe TR at 30 days was associated with worsened overall survival ( log-rank P = 0.02). Baseline moderate-severe TR is not uncommon in patients undergoing TAVR , and frequently improves. However , the presence of AF suggests that that TR is likely to persist after TAVR and is also indicative of a poor long-term outcome. Whether redirecting such patients to surgery for concomitant tricuspid valve repair will further improve outcomes requires further study.
