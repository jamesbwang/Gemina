  Chemokines are a large family of chemotactic cytokines that play critical roles in inflammation<symptom> , development , and diseases. Chemokine expression is highly regulated during development and in response to environmental stimuli. The 3 ' untranslated regions ( 3 '- UTRs) of mRNA are believed to be important in the control of chemokine gene expression. However , the regulatory effects of most chemokine 3 '- UTRs have not been characterized previously. In this work , we systematically studied the effects of 43 CC and CXC chemokine 3 '- UTRs on gene expression in eight human cell lines and two types of human primary cells. We found that chemokine 3 '- UTRs had a wide spectrum of regulatory effects on mRNA abundance and protein production that were tightly correlated with the effects on mRNA stability. In general , 3 '- UTRs had remarkably similar effects across all cell types studied. The presence of AU-rich elements , microRNA targets , and Pumilio<pathogen> binding sites were associated with chemokine 3 '- UTR activity but did not fully account for all 3 '- UTR activity detected using the reporter assay. Mutational analysis illustrated how specific
