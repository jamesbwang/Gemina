  Poor<symptom> access to health services is a significant barrier to achieving the World Health Organization 's hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) elimination targets. We demonstrate how geospatial analysis can be performed with commonly available data to identify areas with the greatest unmet demand for HCV<pathogen> services. We performed an Australia-wide cross-sectional analysis of 2015 HCV<pathogen> notification rates using local government areas ( LGAs) as our unit of analysis. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to determine associations between notification rates and socioeconomic/demographic factors , health service and geographic remoteness area ( RA) classification variables. Additionally , component scores were extracted from a principal component analysis ( PCA) of the healthcare service variables to provide rankings of relative service coverage and unmet demand across Australia. Among LGAs with non-zero notifications , higher rates were associated with areas that had increased socioeconomic disadvantage , more needle and syringe services ( incidence rate ratio ( IRR) 1.022; 95 % CI 1.001 , 1.044) and more alcohol and other drug services ( IRR 1.019; 1.005 , 1.034). The distribution of PCA component scores indicated that per-capita healthcare service coverage was lower in areas outside of major Australian cities. Areas outside of major cities also contained 94 % of LGAs in the lowest two socioeconomic quintiles , as well as 35 % of HCV<pathogen> notifications despite only representing 29 % of the population. As countries aim for HCV<pathogen> elimination , routinely collected data can be used to identify geographical areas for priority service delivery. In Australia , the unmet demand for HCV<pathogen> treatment services is greatest in socioeconomically disadvantaged and non-metropolitan areas.
