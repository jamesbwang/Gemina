  This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor ( MANF) on the MPTP/MPP Male C57BL/6 mice PD model with MPTP-induced were randomly injected bilaterally with MANF or PBS into the striatum<pathogen>. Two weeks later , Rotarod test , immunohistochemistry , and detection of dopamine ( DA) and its metabolites , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , glutathione ( GSH) , and malondialdehyde ( MDA) were performed. A cell model of PD was established by incubating SH-SY5Y cells with MPP The latency reduction in PD mice was partially restored after MANF treatment ( P < 0.05); MANF significantly reduced the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH)- positive dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta ( SNpc) ( P < 0.01); MANF significantly increased the striatal DA level in PD mice ( P < 0.05) and markedly increased the SOD activity ( P < 0.01) and GSH production ( P < 0.01). MANF pre-treatment significantly decreased the MPP MANF can attenuate the neuronal lesion<symptom> in MPTP/MPP
