  The Barberry Eradication Program was an unprecedented federal and state cooperative plant disease control campaign between 1918 and the late 1970s to remove common barberry ( Berberis vulgaris<pathogen>) , the alternate host of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici<pathogen> , from the major centers of wheat production in the United States. Eradication of barberry has been credited with helping to reduce stem rust of wheat to a minor problem in the United States by the end of the campaign. The Barberry Eradication Program has also been viewed as a model for successful eradication based on its robust leadership , effective publicity and public cooperation , forceful quarantine laws , and adaptive eradication methods and procedures employed in its field operations. The Barberry Eradication Program was particularly successful because of its leaders ' ability to adapt to changing internal and external conditions over time. The program lasted nearly a century , extending through two world wars and the Great<pathogen> Depression<symptom> , with each period producing unique challenges. Because of its central role , barberry eradication in Minnesota offers an excellent case study to examine how the program developed over time and ultimately achieved success.
