  Papaya leaf distortion mosaic virus ( PLDMV , the genus Potyvirus) is an emerging threat to papaya production. Here , agroinfection-compatible fluorescent protein-tagged PLDMV infectious cDNA clones driven by the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were successfully constructed using one-step Gibson assembly. The clones were directly transformed into Agrobacterium<pathogen> tumefaciens<pathogen> to prevent potential problems such as plasmid instability during propagation in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> Ninety-five percent of papaya seedlings infected with PLDMV-GFP or PLDMV-mCherry developed systemic symptoms typical of those caused by wild-type PLDMV. Green<symptom> and mCherry red fluorescence was observed in leaves , stems , and roots of infected papaya plants. The fluorescent protein-tagged agroinfectious PLDMV cDNA clones were stable in papaya for more than 90 days and during six serial passages at 30-day intervals. The availability of these infectious clones will contribute to research on PLDMV-host interactions and can be applied in the papaya breeding program for PLDMV resistance.
