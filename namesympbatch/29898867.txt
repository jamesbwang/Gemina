  In the previous study , we used genome shuffling to improve fengycin production of the original strain Bacillus<pathogen> amyloliquefaciens ES-2-4. After two rounds of genome shuffling , a high-yield recombinant FMB72 strain that exhibited 8.30-fold increase in fengycin production was obtained. In this study , comparative proteomic analysis of the parental ES-2-4 and genome-shuffled FMB72 strains was conducted to examine the differentially expressed proteins. In the shuffled strain FMB72 , 50 differently expressed spots ( p < 0.05) were selected to be excised and analyzed using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight/Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry , and finally 44 protein spots were confidently identified according to NCBI database. According to clusters of orthologous groups ( COG) functional category analysis and related references , the differentially expressed proteins could be classified into several functional categories , including proteins involved in metabolism , energy generation and conversion , DNA replication , transcription , translation , ribosomal structure and biogenesis , cell motility and secretion , signal transduction mechanisms , general function prediction. Of the 44 identified proteins , signaling proteins ComA<symptom> and Spo0A may positively regulate fengycin synthesis at transcriptional level. Taken together , the present study will be informative for exploring the exact roles of ComA<symptom> and Spo0A in fengycin synthesis and explaining the molecular mechanism of fengycin synthesis.
