  Fatigue<symptom> is a common symptom in clinical medicine. The complex<pathogen> and multifaceted etiopathogenesis of fatigue<symptom> is a challenge for the differential diagnosis and management of fatigue<symptom>. This brief communication shares two simple mnemonics- LEMON and ABCDE- which help in the evaluation of fatigue<symptom>. These frameworks are as relevant to endocrinology and diabetes as to general practice. The mnemonic LEMON stands for lifestyle , endocrine , medical/metabolic , observer ( physician) and nutrition-related factors which may cause fatigue<symptom>; ABCDE lists the aetiology of fatigue<symptom> in three columns related to physiological/nutritional , psychosocial and biomedical causes ( each column includes one cause and how this relates to the ABCDE rubric).
