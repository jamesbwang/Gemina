  The primary aim was to identify the proportion of individuals within the adult cochlear implant population who are aware of tinnitus<symptom> and those who report a negative impact from this perception , using a bespoke questionnaire designed to limit bias. A secondary aim was to use qualitative analysis of open-text responses to identify themes linked to tinnitus<symptom> perception in this population. A cross-sectional questionnaire study of a large clinical population who received an implant from Cambridge University Hospitals , United Kingdom. Seventy-five percent of respondents reported tinnitus<symptom> awareness. When impact scores for six areas of difficulty were ranked , 13 % of individuals ranked tinnitus<symptom> their primary concern and nearly a third ranked tinnitus<symptom> in the top two positions. Tinnitus<symptom> impact was not found to reduce with duration since implantation. The most common open-text responses were linked to a general improvement postimplantation and acute tinnitus<symptom> alleviation specific to times when the device was in use. Tinnitus<symptom> is a problem for a significant proportion of individuals with a cochlear implant. Clinicians , scientists , and cochlear implant manufacturers should be aware that management of tinnitus<symptom> may be a greater priority for an implantee than difficulties linked to speech perception. Where a positive effect of implantation was reported , there was greater evidence for masking of tinnitus<symptom> via the implant rather than reversal of maladaptive plasticity.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 ( CCBY) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium<pathogen> , provided the original work is properly cited.
