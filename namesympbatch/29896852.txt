  Palmoplantar pustulosis ( PPP) is a refractory , nonbacterial impetigo confined to the palms and soles. Its pathogenesis is still obscure , but it may be associated with the large eccrine sweat<symptom> glands and pores of palmoplantar skin. PPP is considered to be a localized pustular psoriasis. Interleukin ( IL) -8 , IL-36γ and IL-36Ra play important roles in the pathogenesis of pustular psoriasis , but their role in PPP is unclear. To evaluate IL-8 , IL-36γ and IL-36Ra expression in PPP , and their relationship with acrosyringia and pustule<symptom> formation. mRNA expression was quantified in skin samples from patients with PPP ( n = 7) , patients with psoriasis vulgaris<pathogen> ( PSV; n = 8) and healthy controls ( HCs) ( n = 6) by reverse-transcription-real-time PCR. Protein expression was characterized by immunohistochemistry ( PPP , n = 17; PSV , n = 14; HCs , n = 12). Sweat<symptom> ducts , including acrosyringia , were stained for epithelial membrane antigen ( EMA). IL-8 mRNA and protein were markedly increased in PPP lesions<symptom> compared with PSV lesions<symptom> or HC skin. IL-36γ mRNA and protein were significantly more abundant in PPP lesions<symptom> than in HC skin. IL-36Ra mRNA was significantly overexpressed in PPP lesions<symptom> compared with HC skin , but there was no difference in IL-36Ra protein between PPP , PSV and HCs. IL-8 was abundantly expressed by neutrophils in PPP pustules<symptom> , while IL36Ra was localized in the keratinocytes of PPP , PSV and HC skin. IL-36γ and EMA were colocalized in cells surrounding PPP pustules<symptom> , and IL-36γ was also expressed in sweat<symptom> duct cells in the dermis. IL-8 , IL-36γ and IL-36Ra are overexpressed in PPP lesions<symptom>. IL-8 , IL-36γ and acrosyringia , rather than IL-36Ra , are associated with pustule<symptom> formation in PPP.
