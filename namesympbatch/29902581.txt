  It is known that multiple genetic variants can affect immune responses to the hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) vaccine. A case-control study was undertaken to examine the possible association of low responsiveness to the HBV vaccine in a Chinese population with genetic polymorphisms in integrin subunit alpha L , CD58 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor superfamily member 15 , C-C motif chemokine ligand 15 , transforming growth factor beta 3 , and B-cell lymphoma 6 protein. The copy numbers of these six genes were detected in 129 low responders , 129 middle responders and 129 high responders to HBV vaccination. There were no significant differences in the copy numbers of these six genes between the groups. Thus , these findings indicated that the copy number variations of these genes may not be the reason for the low responsiveness to the HBV vaccine in a Chinese population.
