  Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder classified in types<pathogen> 1 and 2. The co-morbidities of narcolepsy type 1 , with hypocretin-1 deficiency , are established. Hypocretin-1 in the central and peripheral nervous systems regulates nociception and pain. However , the patients with narcolepsy type 2 have similar excessive daytime sleepiness and co-morbidities without elucidation. The objective of the study was to determine the frequency and the characteristic of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> according to the type of narcolepsy. We also investigated the effect of the interaction between the nutritional status and the type of narcolepsy. It was a cross-sectional study using self-administered questionnaires. Patients with narcolepsy ( 33 type 1 and 33 type 2) , from Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Paulo , Brazil , matched by age and gender to 33 control subjects were included. Both types<pathogen> of narcolepsy presented a high frequency of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 84.84 % type 1 versus 75.75 % type 2) , with indistinct pain characteristics between them. The odds ratio was 20.8 in type 1 and 11.6 in type 2 , compared with controls. Obese individuals with narcolepsy type 1 and type 2 did not present a significant difference in pain intensity , compared with obese controls. Patients with narcolepsy type 1 and type 2 were associated with a high frequency of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> emerged as a co-morbidity never reported before in type 2. Depression<symptom> possibly influences pain perception in these patients. Obesity might play a role in pain intensity in narcolepsy. The treatment of narcolepsy should take account of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , depression<symptom> and obesity management.
