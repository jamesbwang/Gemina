  Poly-γ-glutamic acid ( γ-PGA) is an important multifunctional biopolymer with various applications , for which adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) supply plays a vital role in biosynthesis. In this study , the enhancement of γ-PGA production was attempted through various approaches of improving ATP supply in the engineered strains of Bacillus<pathogen> licheniformis<pathogen> The first approach is to engineer respiration<symptom> chain branches of B.<pathogen> licheniformis<pathogen> , elimination of cytochrome bd oxidase branch reduced the maintenance coefficient , leading to a 19.27 % increase of γ-PGA yield. The second approach is to introduce Vitreoscilla hemoglobin ( VHB) into recombinant B.<pathogen> licheniformis<pathogen> , led to a 13.32 % increase of γ-PGA yield. In the third approach , the genes purB and adK in ATP-biosynthetic pathway were respectively overexpressed , with the AdK overexpressed strain increased γ-PGA yield by 14.69 %. Our study also confirmed that the respiratory nitrate reductase , NarGHIJ , is responsible for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite , and assimilatory nitrate reductase NasBC is for conversion of nitrite to ammonia<pathogen> Both NarGHIJ and NasBC were positively regulated by the two-component system ResD-ResE , and overexpression of NarG , NasC , and ResD also improved the ATP supply and the consequent γ-PGA yield. Based on the above individual methods , a method of combining the deletion of cydBC gene and overexpression of genes vgB , adK , and resD were used to enhance ATP content of the cells to 3.53 μmol/g of DCW , the mutant WX-BCVAR with this enhancement produced 43.81 g/L of γ-PGA , a 38.64 % improvement compared to wild-type strain WX-02. Collectively , our results demonstrate that improving ATP content in B.<pathogen> licheniformis<pathogen> is an efficient strategy to improve γ-PGA production.
