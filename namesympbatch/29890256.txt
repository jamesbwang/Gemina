  In this paper , we shed light on the potential of Pluronic ® mixed micelles in lung delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. To this purpose , Pluronic ® P123/F127 mixed micelles ( PMM) , exhibiting superior stability in biological fluids , were loaded with budesonide ( BUD) , a model hydrophobic corticosteroid , and fully investigated focusing on their stability in pulmonary-relevant media , transport through the mucus barrier and aerodynamic behaviour in vitro. Then , lung bio-distribution and efficacy were evaluated in vivo , after intra-tracheal administration in rats. PMM showed excellent stability in saline , mucin , artificial airway mucus and simulated interstitial lung fluid. Likely due to their small size coupled with the hydrophilic biofouling shell , PMM did not interact with mucin and consequently diffused through artificial mucus. BUD was loaded with high efficiency in PMM and released at sustained rate in artificial mucus. BUD-PMM dispersion in saline was efficiently delivered through a common jet nebulizer without aggregation. After intratracheal administration in rats , PMM labelled with Rhodamine B persisted in the lung up to 24 h , while serum levels rapidly dropped. Finally , the effects of BUD-PMM in a rat model of lung inflammation<symptom> induced by intra-tracheal aerosolization of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) from E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> were investigated. Of note , a single intra-tracheal aerosolization of BUD-PMM significantly reduced bronchoalveolar neutrophil infiltration and the expression of protein/enzymes derived from the arachidonic acid cascade induced by LPS , whereas a control BUD aqueous suspension showed a weaker effect. Overall , this study demonstrates that inhalable formulations of PMM can be considered as a platform for local delivery of hydrophobic drugs at lungs worth of further consideration.
