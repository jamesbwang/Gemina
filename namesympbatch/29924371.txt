  In European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery ( ESC/EACTS) guidelines , six indications have been proposed for making a decision on myocardial revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease ( CAD). Our aim was to study a discrepancy between the actual clinical situation and ESC/EACTS indications on performing the revascularization in patients with CAD in Russia. We used retrospective clinical data on patients with stable CAD enrolled in the 2012-2015 Russian Registry of Hypertension , Coronary Artery Disease , and Chronic<symptom> Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom>. A total of 1522 patients with CAD ( aged 53.0 Â± 8.5 years , 76.2 % male) were used for analysis. All patients were divided into two groups: 591 patients with performed myocardial revascularization ( named as R-CAD) and 931 patients refused from revascularization ( named as NR-CAD). Factors associated with revascularization performance were identified by discriminant function analysis. ESC/EACTS indications for revascularization were assessed. A total of 1196 patients with CAD had any ESC/EACTS indication for revascularization , but only 40.2 % of them had performed invasive coronary intervention. Myocardial revascularization was appropriate in 81.4 % of R-CAD patients and 76.8 % of NR-CAD patients. The main factor of revascularization performance was any stenosis > 50 % and grades III-IV of stable angina. With non-performed revascularization , the following factors were associated: limiting angina or angina equivalent , unresponsive to medical therapy , atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease and increasing the New<pathogen> York Heart Association class of chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Most ESC/EACTS indications had little effect on decision-making on revascularization. There is a discrepancy between the actual clinical situation and ESC/EACTS guidelines on myocardial revascularization in patients with stable CAD in Russia.
