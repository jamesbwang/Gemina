  Labor pain<symptom> is one of the most intense<symptom> pains<symptom> experienced by women , which leads to an increase in the number of women opting to undergo a cesarean delivery. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological analgesia methods are used to control labor pain<symptom>. Epidural analgesia is the most commonly used pharmacological analgesia method. However , it may have side effects on the fetus<pathogen> and the mother. Light-emitting diode ( LED) photobiomodulation is an effective and noninvasive alternative to pharmacological methods. To evaluate the effects of LED photobiomodulation on analgesia during labor. In total , 60 women in labor admitted to a public maternity hospital will be selected for a randomized controlled trial. The participants will be randomized into 2 groups: intervention group ( analgesia with LED therapy ( n = 30)) and control group ( analgesia with bath therapy ( n = 30)). The perception of pain will be assessed using the visual analogue scale ( VAS) , with a score from 0 to 10 at baseline , that is , before the intervention. In both the groups , the procedures will last 10 minutes and will be performed at 3 time points during labor: during cervical dilation of 4 to 5 cm , 6 to 7 cm , and 8 to 9 cm. At all 3 time points , pain perception will be evaluated using VAS shortly after the intervention. In addition , the evaluation of membrane characteristics ( intact or damaged) , heart rate , uterine dynamics , and cardiotocography will be performed at all time points. The use of LED photobiomodulation will have an analgesic effect superior to that of the bath therapy.
