  A short inter-pregnancy interval increases the risk for maternal and neonatal deaths in addition to other pregnancy complications including: preterm delivery , low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight , anaemia and premature rupture of membranes<symptom>. However , only one half of Kenyan women , who have no desire to conceive immediately after birth , are using contraception one year after delivery. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of uptake of post-partum family planning ( PPFP). Setting: The study was conducted among post-partum women accompanying their children for their first measles<pathogen> vaccination at Webuye County Hospital ( WCH) , in western Kenya. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving 259 randomly sampled post-partum women , accompanying their children for their first measles<pathogen> vaccination. A structured , interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of PPFP uptake. Results: The uptake of PPFP among women at 9 months post-partum at WCH was found to be 78.4 % Â± 5.0 %. The odds of PPFP uptake among women living with their sexual partners was 88.2 % less than among those not living with their partners with the true population effect between 97 % and 51 % ( OR = 0.118; 95 % CI: 0.028-0.494; p = 0.003). Conclusions: Not living with her sexual partner in the same house is the key predictor of a woman 's PPFP uptake in WCH. This study recommends that any programme aimed at improving post-partum contraceptive use in WCH should target women who live with their partners in the same house.
