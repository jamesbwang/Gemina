  Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> , an obligate intracellular apicomplexan , causes latent infection in about one third of the human population. During latent infection , T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> bradyzoites are found within cysts<symptom> , a modified parasitophorous vacuole. This parasite has a large family of SRS ( surface antigen-1 related sequence) proteins which are reported to be involved in attachment of these organisms to their mammalian host cells and in immune subversion during latent infection. We have identified a novel mucin domain containing SRS protein , using a glycoepitope-specific antibody , which recognizes the cyst<symptom> wall. SRS13 has two SRS domains and between these domains is a threonine-rich tandem repeat mucin-like domain that is similar to the mucin-like domain seen in another cyst<symptom> wall specific SRS protein CST1 ( SRS44). SRS13 is upregulated in bradyzoites and O-GalNAc glycosylated by ppGalNAc-T2 and T3. Similar to the cyst<symptom> wall protein CST1 , SRS13 localizes to the cyst<symptom> wall , but unlike CST1 , SRS13 is dispensable for normal cyst<symptom> wall formation. Together , these findings elucidate the role of a second SRS mucin domain protein , SRS13 , in bradyzoite biology and expands the previously reported functions of the SRS protein family.
