  The diagnosis of angle-closure glaucoma secondary to iridociliary cysts<symptom> is challenging and lacks compiled literature support. We present a rare case of bilateral angle-closure glaucoma associated with pseudoplateau iris due to multiple ciliary cysts<symptom> and conducted a systematic review of the literature to find similar case reports published between November 2006 and November 2016. Only 19 case reports present treatment modalities , and most cases required more than one therapeutic approach for controlling the intraocular pressure. Pseudoplateau iris attributed to iridociliary cysts<symptom> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with narrow angles , particularly those with ocular hypertension and glaucoma , in which management is complex<pathogen>. In addition to gonioscopy , ultrasound biomicroscopy is considered the conclusive method for accurate diagnosis.
