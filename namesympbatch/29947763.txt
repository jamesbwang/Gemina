  Characterization of the cardiac phenotype associated with the novel LMNA nonsense mutation c. 544C > T , p.Q182 * , which we have identified in a large five-generation family. A family tree was constructed. Clinical data ( arrhythmia , syncope , sudden cardiac death ( SCD) , New<pathogen> York Heart Association ( NYHA) class) were collected from living and deceased family members. DNA of 23 living family members was analysed for mutations in LMNA. Additionally , dilated cardiomyopathy multi-gene-panel testing and whole exome sequencing were performed in some family members to identify potential phenotype-modifiers. In this five-generation family ( n = 65) , 17 SCDs occurred at 49.3 ± 10.0 years. Furthermore , we identified eight additional mutation-carriers , seven symptomatic ( 44 ± 13 years) , and one asymptomatic ( 44 years). First signs of disease ( sinus bradycardia<symptom> with atrioventricular ( AV)- block I °) occurred at 36.5 ± 8.1 years. Paroxysmal atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) ( onset at 41.8 ± 5.7 years) rapidly progressed to permanent AF ( 46.2 ± 9.8 years). Subsequently , AV-conduction worsened , syncope , pacemaker-dependence , and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( 43.3 ± 8.2 years) followed. Ventricular arrhythmia caused SCD in patients without implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD). Patients protected by ICD developed rapidly progressive<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 45.2 ± 10.6 years). A different phenotype was seen in a sub-family in three patients with early onset of rapidly decompensating heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and only minor prior arrhythmia-related symptoms. One patient received high-urgency heart transplantation ( HTX) at 32 years , while two died prior to HTX. One of them developed lethal peripartum-associated heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Possible disease-modifiers were identified in this ` heart<symptom> failure<symptom> sub-family '. The novel LMNA nonsense mutation c. 544C > T causes a severe arrhythmogenic phenotype manifesting with high incidence of SCD in most patients; and in one sub-family , a distinct phenotype with fast progressing heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , indicating the need for early consideration of ICD-implantation and listing for heart-transplantation.
