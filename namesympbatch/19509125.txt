  We investigated whether stable eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3e/inter 6 ( eIF-3e/ Int6) RNA-silencing ( siRNA-Int6) can ameliorate pre-eclampsia ( PE) by promoting angiogenesis in an N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME)- induced rat pre-eclampsia ( PE) model. Twenty-four pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated into 4 groups , including controls ( Con) without any treatment , and 18 from gestational day ( GD) 7 to GD17 L-NAME-treated rats , which were divided into stable siRNA-Int6 transfected ( siRNA-Int6) , negative vector control siRNA ( NC-siRNA) and PE control ( PE-Con) groups. All adenovirus<pathogen> siRNA transfections were performed on GD7 via intravenous tail injection. On GD0 , GD11 and GD17 , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and on GD6 and GD17 , protein estimations in 24 h urine samples were conducted. All animals were sacrificed on GD18. In the PE-Con group , placental Int6 was expressed to a significantly greater level than in the Con group , which was reversed by the application of siRNA-Int6. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and proteinuria<symptom> were significantly lower in the siRNA-Int6 group than in the PRE-Con group. As shown by CD31 and IB4 expression , placental micro-vascular density ( MVD) was significantly higher in the siRNA-Int6 group than in the PE-Con and NC-siRNA groups , which has accompanied by enhanced trophoblast invasion. Int6 silencing alleviated the maternal clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia and promoted placental angiogenesis in pregnant L-NAME-treated rats.
