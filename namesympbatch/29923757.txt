  Extended nitric oxide ( NO) analysis offers the partitioned monitoring of inflammation<symptom> in central and peripheral airways. Different mathematical models are used to estimate pulmonary NO dynamics in asthma with variable results and limitations. We aimed to establish a protocol for extended NO analysis in patients with differing asthma severity. Forty patients with stable asthma and twenty-five matched control subjects were recruited. Exhaled NO was measured at constant flow rates between 10 and 300 mL/s. Twelve controls performed NO measurements weekly for four weeks. The proportions of patients with technically acceptable measurements at 10-30-50-100-150-200-250-300 mL/s exhalation flow rates were 8-58-100-98-98-95-90-80 % , respectively. Alveolar NO ( CANO) and total flux of NO in the conducting airways ( JawNO) were calculated with the linear method from NO values measured at 100-150-200-250 mL/s exhalation flows. The mean intra-subject bias for JawNO and CANO in controls was 0.16 nL/s and 0.85 ppb , respectively. Both JawNO ( 1.31/ 0.83-2.97/ vs. 0.70/ 0.54-0.87/ nL/s , p < 0.001) and CANO<pathogen> ( 4.08/ 2.63-7.16/ vs. 2.42/ 1.83-2.89/ ppb , p < 0.001) were increased in patients with asthma compared to controls. In patients , CANO correlated with RV/TLC ( r = 0.58 , p < 0.001) , FEF Calculation of alveolar NO concentration with the linear method from values obtained at medium flow rates ( 100-250 mL/s) is feasible even in asthmatic patients with severe airflow limitation and may provide information on small airways dysfunction in asthma.
