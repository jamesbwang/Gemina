  A cross sectional study was conducted on 1010 goats from 25 flocks located in the eastern province , Saudi Arabia , to study the prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) among goat farms. A total of 235 milk samples and 775 nasal swabs were collected for bacteriological investigation. Based on resistance to cefoxitin , 20 isolates were permissively identified as MRSA. PCR with speciﬁc primers was used to conﬁrm MRSA. The prevalence of MRSA was 2 %; with maximum prevalence in mastitic milk ( 9.2 %) and swabs from animals showed respiratory signs ( 2.6 %) , while the lowest prevalence was identified in apparently normal milk ( 0.6). The standard disk diffusion test was used for in vitro evaluation of isolates resistance profile to 13 antimicrobial agents. Multidrug resistance ( MDR) was detected in all MRSA and in 23.5 % of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MSSA). Univariable association between the prevalence of MDR/MRSA strains and management practices indicated a higher prevalence with larger size flocks , where raising animals for both meat and milk<symptom> production<symptom> , and where antibiotics were used during the last 30 days , the latter was particularly pertinent to penicillin-streptomycin. Multivariable models indicated that larger flocks ( 200-400 , and > 400) were , respectively , 4 and 3.5 fold more likely to have MDR S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> compared to smaller flocks ( < 200).
