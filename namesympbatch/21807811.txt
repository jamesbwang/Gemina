  Depression<symptom> is a mood disorder that may lead to severe outcomes including mental breakdown , self-injury , and suicide. Potential causes of depression<symptom> include genetic , sociocultural , and individual-level factors. However , public understandings of depression<symptom> guided by a complex interplay of media<pathogen> and other societal discourses might not be congruent with the scientific knowledge. Misunderstandings of depression<symptom> can lead to under-treatment and stigmatization of depression<symptom> Against this backdrop , this study aims to achieve a holistic understanding of the patterns and dynamics in discourses about depression<symptom> from various information sources in China by looking at related posts on social media. A content analysis was conducted with 902 posts about depression<symptom> randomly selected within a three-year period ( 2014 to 2016) on the mainstream social media platform in China , Sina Weibo. Posts were analyzed with a focus on attributions of and solutions to depression<symptom> , attitudes towards depression<symptom> , and efficacy indicated by the posts across various information sources. Results suggested that depression<symptom> was most often attributed to individual-level factors. Across all the sources , individual-level attributions were often adopted by state-owned media whereas health and academic experts and organizations most often mentioned biological causes of depression<symptom> Citizen journalists and unofficial social groups tended to make societal-level attributions. Overall , traditional media posts suggested the lowest efficacy in coping with depression<symptom> and the most severe negative outcomes as compared with other sources. The dominance of individual-level attributions and solutions regarding depression<symptom> on Chinese social media on one hand manifests the public 's limited understanding of depression<symptom> and on the other hand , may further constrain adoption of scientific explanations about depression<symptom> and exacerbate stigmatization towards depressed individuals. Mass media 's posts centered on description of severe outcomes of depression<symptom> without suggestions of solutions ' effectiveness , which may induce more anxiety<symptom> among depressed individuals. Campaigns promoting comprehensive understandings about depression<symptom> and popular works translating scientific findings on depression<symptom> to the public are called for.
