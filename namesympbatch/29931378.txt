Drop foot during swing phase and muscular imbalance in the stance phase in cavovarus foot , flexible cavovarus foot , accompanying symptoms such as recurrent calluses and ulcerations , compliance. Pes cavovarus of spastic genesis , mild deformities , fixed bony deformity , lack of compliance , florid inflammation<symptom> in the foot area , severe peripheral artery disease ( PAD) , diabetes mellitus. Description of the gradual escalation of joint-sparing bony and soft tissue procedures. Postoperative lower leg cast. In cases of combined bony and soft tissue correction , first 6 weeks of nonweight-bearing with lower leg cast , then 6 weeks of lower leg walking cast.
