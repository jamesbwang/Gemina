  To describe a case of concurrent cricopharyngeal achalasia with laryngomalacia as a cause of failure to thrive , and to review the literature and management options of cricopharyngeal achalasia in the paediatric population. A chart review was performed on a four-month-old male , referred for failure to thrive , and diagnosed with cricopharyngeal achalasia and laryngomalacia. A PubMed and Embase search for ` cricopharyngeal achalasia ' and ` laryngomalacia ' was conducted. A review of reported paediatric cricopharyngeal achalasia patients , with emphasis on management options , was undertaken. A flexible laryngoscopic examination confirmed the laryngomalacia diagnosis , and videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing demonstrated cricopharyngeal achalasia via a cricopharyngeal bar. Supraglottoplasty was performed , with botulinum<pathogen> toxin injection into the cricopharyngeus muscle , with resultant improvement in oral intake and resolution of failure to thrive. The literature review revealed no reported case of the combined pathologies as a cause of failure to thrive. Functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing are complimentary in the evaluation of paediatric patients with failure to thrive and suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia<symptom>. Both supraglottoplasty and botulinum<pathogen> toxin injection are effective for definitive management in cases of combined pathology , and can be safely performed in a single surgical setting.
