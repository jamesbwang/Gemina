  Several ATP-depending reactions take place in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER). Although in Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> ER the existence of a Sac1p-dependent ATP transport system was already known , its direct involvement in ATP transport was excluded. Here we report an extensive biochemical characterization of a partially purified adenine nucleotide transport system ( ANTS) not dependent on Sac1p. Highly purified ER membranes<symptom> from the wild-type and Δsac1 yeast strains reconstituted into liposomes transported ATP with the same efficiency. A chromatography on hydroxyapatite was used to partially purify ANTS from Δsac1 ER extract. The two ANTS-enriched transport activity eluted fractions showed essentially the presence of 4 bands , one having an apparent MW of 56 kDa , similar to that observed for ANTS identified in rat liver ER. The two fractions reconstituted into liposomes efficiently transported , by a strict counter-exchange mechanism , ATP and ADP. ATP transport was saturable with a Km of 0.28 mM. The ATP/ADP exchange mechanism and the kinetic constants suggest that the main physiological role of ANTS is to catalyse the transport of ATP into ER , where it is used in several energy-requiring reactions and to export back to the cytosol the ADP produced.
