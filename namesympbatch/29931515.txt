  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) may be associated with worsening of cognitive performance. We studied patients with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) with and without COPD , and we analyzed , in a retrospective way , clinical and neuropsychological variables to verify if COPD plays a pejorative role on cognitive or functional autonomy in patients with dementia. We enrolled 23 adult patients ( AD-COPD) with probable AD and COPD and 23 with AD only ( AD-only); they were matched for sex , age , educational level , and Mini<pathogen> Mental<symptom> State Examination ( MMSE) at the disease onset. Global cognitive status was estimated using MMSE at the first assessment and after 24 months. Memory , executive functions , praxia , and language were the other cognitive domains analyzed. The two groups were also compared for the presence of behavioral disorders ( anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> AD-COPD had worse results in executive functions screening than AD-only; no significant differences were found comparing other cognitive domains; moreover , there was no significant difference between the two groups considering the decrease in MMSE scores. AD-COPD also showed a higher presence of depression<symptom> COPD is known to be associated with the development of cognitive deficits , in particular , regarding for executive functions and attention , memory and logical reasoning. In this context , MMSE has a low diagnostic accuracy to underline effective cognitive impairment in AD-COPD. Our study shows a higher frequency of frontal deficits and behavioral disturbances in patients with AD and COPD than patients with AD-only. COPD could complicate the management of AD patients , thus necessitating a closer and multidisciplinary monitoring.
