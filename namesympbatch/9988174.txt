  In August 2015 , a nonhuman primate facility south of Manila , the Philippines , noted unusual deaths of 6 cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis) , characterized by generalized rashes<symptom> , inappetence , or sudden death. We identified Reston<pathogen> ebolavirus<pathogen> ( RESTV) infection in monkeys by using serologic and molecular assays. We isolated viruses in tissues from infected monkeys and determined viral genome sequences. RESTV found in the 2015 outbreak is genetically closer to 1 of the 4 RESTVs that caused the 2008 outbreak among swine. Eight macaques , including 2 also infected with RESTV , tested positive for measles<pathogen>. Concurrently , the measles<pathogen> virus<pathogen> was circulating throughout the Philippines , indicating that the infection of the macaques may be a reverse zoonosis. Improved biosecurity measures will minimize the public health risk , as well as limit the introduction of disease and vectors.
