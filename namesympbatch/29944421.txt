  Although recognized as a feature of schizophrenia since the time of Kraepelin , motor disorders have received relatively little attention , particularly as regard their phenomenology. This is particularly the case in the English-speaking literature , where ` automaticity ' , mutism , and autonomic instability , have been emphasized among the features of catatonia at the expense of more complex<pathogen> behaviors and mannerisms. The possible relationship between the content of thinking disorders , such as hallucinations and dereistic thinking , and involuntary and semi-voluntary movement disorders , has been little noted. That such gestures might have `` intentionality '' , or meaning , has not been considered. The case is presented of an adolescent who developed involuntary<symptom> movements<symptom> which seemed to have meaning in reference to his interests. The thought content , phenomenology , and brain abnormalities underpinning catatonia merit further study.
