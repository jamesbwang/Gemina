  Transient receptor potential ( TRP) vallinoid 1 ( TRPV1) and ankyrin 1 ( TRPA1) are two transducing channels expressed on peripheral sensory nerves involved in pain sensation<symptom>. Upregulation of their expression , stimulated by inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in animal pain models , correlate with the induction of nociceptive hyper-sensitivity. Herein , we firstly demonstrate by immuno-cytochemical labelling that TNFα augments the surface content of these channels on rat cultured dorsal root ganglion ( DRG) neurons which , in turn , enhances the electrophysiological and functional responses of the latter to their specific agonists. A molecular basis underlying this TNFα-dependent enhancement was unveiled by pre-treating DRGs with a recently-published chimeric protein , consisting of the protease light chain ( LC) of botulinum<pathogen> neurotoxin ( BoNT) serotype E fused to full-length BoNT/A ( LC/E-BoNT/A). This cleaves synaptosomal-associated protein of Mr 25k ( SNAP-25) and reported previously to exhibit anti-nociceptive activity in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Low pM concentrations of this chimera were found to prevent the TNFα-stimulated delivery of TRPV1/A1 to the neuronal plasmalemma and , accordingly , decreased their incremental functional activities relative to those of control cells , an effect accompanied by SNAP-25 cleavage. Advantageously , LC/E-BoNT/A did not reduce the basal surface contents of the two channels or their pharmacological responses. Thus , use of multiple complementary methodologies provides evidence that LC/E-BoNT/A abolishes the TNFα-dependent augmented , but not resting , surface trafficking of TRPV1/A1. As TNFα is known to induce nociceptive hyper-sensitivity in vivo , our observed inhibition by LC/E-BoNT/A of its action in vitro could contribute to its potential alleviation of pain.
