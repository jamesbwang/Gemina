  We described the utility of computed tomography ( CT) angiography in detection of bleeding vessels for a rapid percutaneous arterial embolization of the spontaneous rectus<pathogen> sheath hematoma. A 70-year-old woman comes to our attention with acute<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and a low hemoglobin level. An unenhanced CT was performed demonstrating a large rectus<pathogen> sheath hematoma. A conservative management was initially established. Despite this therapy , the abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> increased together with a further decrease of hemoglobin values. A CT angiography was then performed , demonstrating an active bleeding within the hematoma and addressing the patient to a rapid percutaneous arterial embolization.
