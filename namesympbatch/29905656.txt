  Descending regulation of spinal cord responses to nociceptive signaling has a strong influence on pain perception. Previous studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) have indicated that in addition to reactive responses to nociceptive signals , there is a continuous component to regulation , and that it may vary with differences in pain sensitivity. We hypothesize that this continuous regulation component occurs routinely in fMRI studies before noxious stimulation , as well as during , and after stimulation. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing data from 59 healthy participants in 4 previous fMRI studies in our laboratory using noxious heat stimuli. Analyses included structural equation modeling to identify coordinated blood oxygenation-level-dependent ( BOLD) signal variations between regions ( ie , connectivity) and Bayesian regression of BOLD time-series responses in relation to pain ratings and stimulus temperatures. The results demonstrate the periaqueductal gray-rostral ventromedial medulla-spinal cord descending modulation pathway , influenced by input from the hypothalamus , parabrachial nucleus , and nucleus tractus solitarius<pathogen>. Connectivity between specific regions is observed to vary in relation to pain sensitivity. The results support the conclusion that homeostatic autonomic control influences the net descending pain regulation , and therefore influences pain sensitivity. The results describe the overall properties of pain processing ( specifically pain elicited by heat) in the healthy human brainstem and spinal cord , and mechanisms for variation across individuals. This understanding is expected to be important for studies of how pain processing is altered in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> conditions.
