  In this study , we isolated , amplified and sequenced GII .3 norovirus<pathogen> ( NoV) strains from children admitted to a department of pediatric gastroenterology presenting with acute<symptom> gastroenteritis<symptom> from September 2015 to March 2016. A total of 35 stool<symptom> samples were collected and eight were GII .3 NoV positive , based on sequencing. The complete genome sequences were determined for two strains while partial genome sequences , encompassing approximately 3.2 kb of the 3 ' end , were generated for the six other strains. Genotyping analysis of all strains indicated that they belonged to GII P12/GII .3. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these isolated strains could be divided into two clusters. Strains in cluster IV were the most frequently isolated and exhibited less intra-cluster variation in nucleotide sequences. Our study demonstrated that the GII.P12/ GII .3 recombinant strain was the dominant GII .3 NoVs in Zhengzhou city.
