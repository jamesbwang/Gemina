  Tissue necrosis<symptom> caused by insufficient perfusion is a major complication in flap transfer. This study evaluated whether treatment with cilostazol or hydroalcoholic extract of seeds of Euterpe oleracea Mart. ( açaí) protects the transverse rectus<pathogen> abdominis myocutaneous ( TRAM) flap against ischemic damage in hamsters. Fifty-four hamsters were divided into three oral treatment groups: placebo , açaí , or cilostazol. Caudally based , unipedicled TRAM flaps were raised , sutured back , classified into four vascular zones ( I-IV) , and evaluated for tissue viability , capillary blood flow ( CBF) , perfused vessel density ( PVD) , and microvascular flow index ( MFI) by orthogonal polarization spectral imaging at three time points: immediately postoperatively ( IPO) , 24 h postoperatively ( 24hPO) , and 7 d postoperatively ( 7POD). Comparing to placebo , açaí increased PVD at IPO and açaí and cilostazol increased CBF and PVD at 24hPO in zone I; cilostazol increased CBF , PVD , and MFI at IPO , and CBF at 24hPO in zone II; açaí and cilostazol increased CBF at all time points and PVD and MFI at IPO and 24hPO in zone III; cilostazol increased CBF at IPO and 7POD , açaí increased CBF at 7POD , and both increased PVD and MFI at all time points in zone IV; and açaí and cilostazol increased the percentage of viable area in zones III and IV. Açaí and cilostazol treatments had a protective effect against ischemic damage to TRAM flaps in hamsters , improving microvascular blood flow and increasing the survival of flap zones contralateral to the vascular pedicle ( zones III and IV).
