  Activation of the kynurenine pathway is one of the described mechanisms by which inflammation<symptom> can induce depression<symptom> It involves multiple pathways including interference with the bioavailability of tryptophan central to the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin. In this systematic review , we examine the relationship between kynurenine metabolites ( kynurenine , kynurenic acid , tryptophan , quinolinic acid , the ratio of kynurenine and tryptophan) and mood disorders by conducting a meta-analysis. Fifty-six studies were identified , 21 met inclusion criteria and 14 were deemed suitable ( 9 investigating unipolar depression<symptom> and 5 bipolar disorder). We found decreased levels of kynurenine in unipolar major depression<symptom> vs. healthy controls but studies were significantly heterogeneous in nature. No significant differences were found in tryptophan levels or kynurenine/tryptophan ratios. Kynurenine metabolites are likely to play a role in major depression<symptom> but an exact etiological role in mood disorder seem complex<pathogen> and requires further research.
