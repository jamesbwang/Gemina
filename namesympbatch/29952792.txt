  To synthesize published literature on noncommunicable disease ( NCD) behavior change communication ( BCC) interventions in sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA) among persons living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLHIV) and in the general population to inform efforts to adopt similar HIV<pathogen> and NCD BCC intervention activities. We conducted a literature review of NCD BCC interventions and included 20 SSA-based studies. Inclusion criteria entailed describing a BCC intervention targeting any four priority NCDs ( cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes , cervical cancer , and depression<symptom> or both HIV<pathogen> and any of the NCDs. The RE-AIM ( Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , and Maintenance) framework was used to assess potential public health impact of these studies. We also solicited expert opinions from 10 key informants on the topic of HIV/NCD health promotion in five SSA countries. The BCC interventions reviewed targeted multiple parts of the HIV<pathogen> and NCD continuum at both individual and community levels. Various strategies ( i.e. health education , social marketing , motivational interviewing , mobile health , and peer support) were employed. However , few studies addressed more than one dimension of the RE-AIM framework. Opinions solicited from the key informants supported the feasibility of integrating HIV<pathogen> and NCD BCC interventions in SSA potentially improving access , service provision and service demand , especially for marginalized and vulnerable populations. Although HIV/NCD integration can improve effectiveness of preventive services at individual and community levels , potential public health impact of such approaches remain unknown as reach , adoptability , and sustainability of both integrated and nonintegrated NCD BCC approaches published to date have not been well characterized.
