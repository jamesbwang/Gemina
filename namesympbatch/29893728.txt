  Endotoxins are potential toxics impacting human health through respiration<symptom> derived in wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) , yet the formation of endotoxins during wastewater treatment processes is still lacking research. In our study , the distribution of endotoxins and bacterial community structure in the wastewater of three full scale pharmaceutical WWTPs were explored using the limulus amebocyte lysate ( LAL) test and MiSeq technique. Results showed that higher endotoxin activities in the influent of Plant A and Plant C ( 560 and 1140 EU/mL) , stemming from the fermentation process , were found compared to that of Plant B ( 135 EU/mL) , coming from the process of chemical synthesis. During the anaerobic treatment and the cyclic activated sludge system ( CASS) in the three WWTPs , the endotoxin activity increased , while it declined in the aerobic treatment system. In all bioreactors , the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 50.0-94.6 %. Bacteria with high lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) in LAL assay were found at the genus level of Bacteroides , Enterococcus<pathogen> , Desulfovibrio , and
