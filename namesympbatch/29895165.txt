  Plant-derived flavonoids contain large amount of compounds with pharmacological effects. In this study , we showed the compound Kaempferol to have robust antiviral activity against bovine herpesvirus<pathogen> 1 ( BoHV-1) replication in vitro. Kaempferol at a concentration of 100 μmol/l completely inhibited viral replication in MDBK cells. It mainly affects the viral replication at the post-entry stages. The inhibition of Akt signaling is a potential mechanism underlying the antiviral effect of Kaempferol. In addition , at a concentration of 25 and 50 μmol/l Kaempferol could significantly reduce the expression of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF-α) , interleukin-8 ( IL-8) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( MIP-1α) in human promonocytic U937 cells-derived macrophages ( dU937) in response to lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) stimulation. Overall , our results indicated that Kaempferol provides a potent protection against BoHV-1 infection and LPS-induced inflammatory response.
