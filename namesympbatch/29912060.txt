  Abnormalities in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) are frequently reported in persons-living-with HIV<pathogen> ( PLWH). We compared clinical cerebral MRI reports in 59 PLWH and 29 lifestyle matched controls. Although clinical abnormalities were highly prevalent ( 47.7 %) , and included white-matter lesions<symptom> ( 46.6 %) , microvascular disease ( 22.7 %) and cerebral volume loss ( 11.4 %) , no differences were apparent between PLWH and controls with abnormalities being associated with age and hypertension rather than HIV-serostatus.
