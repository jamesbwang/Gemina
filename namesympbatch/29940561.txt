  Fatigue<symptom> and reduced exercise capacity are common concomitants of coronary artery disease ( CAD). They are known to be associated with the deterioration in mental health , including emotional and cognitive status. However , the precise nature of the inter-relationship is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between fatigue<symptom> and exercise capacity on the one hand and changes in cognitive functioning on the other , to generate new heuristics for clinical management and outcome prediction of CAD. A cross-sectional study included 827 in-patients ( 58 ± 9 years , 75 % men) with CAD. Patients were evaluated for demographic , cardiac characteristics , and exercise capacity. The Multidimensional Fatigue<symptom> Inventory-20 was used to assess fatigue<symptom> , the Mini<pathogen> Mental<symptom> State Examination for global cognitive function , the Digit Span Test , Digit Symbol Test , and Trail Making Test for executive aspects of cognitive functioning , and the Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale for anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptom severity. Using multiple regression analysis , after adjusting for possible confounders such as anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> , mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom> was associated with several executive aspects of cognitive function including short-term memory ( Digit Symbol Test pairs recalled correctly ( β = -0.127 , p < 0.005)) , psychomotor performance ( time to complete the Digit Symbol Test ( β = 0.089 , p < 0.03)) , and cognitive processing speed ( Trail Making Test A ( β = 0.081 , p < 0.05)). In rehabilitating CAD patients , certain aspects of executive functioning were independently associated with mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom>. These findings suggest that the subjective experience of mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom> , rather than reduced exercise capacity , is significantly associated with cognitive function.
