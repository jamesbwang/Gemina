  The objective of this work was to accomplish the isolation , molecular identification and characterizing the physiology of the causal agent of the algal spot in mango trees. For this purpose , the pathogen growth was assessed in different culture media , with subsequent observation and measurements of the filamentous cells. The molecular identification was made using mycelium obtained from leaf lesions<symptom> and pure algae<pathogen> colonies grown in culture medium. Descriptions based on DNA sequencing indicated that the algae<pathogen> is
