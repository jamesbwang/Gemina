  Branch formation in trees has an inherent tendency toward exponential growth , but exponential growth in the number of branches can not continue indefinitely. It has been suggested that trees balance<symptom> this tendency toward expansion by also losing branches grown in previous growth cycles. Here , we present a model for branch formation and branch loss during ontogeny that builds on the phenomenological assumption of a branch carrying capacity. The model allows us to derive approximate analytical expressions for the number of tips on a branch , the distribution of growth modules within a branch , and the rate and size distribution of tree wood litter produced. Although limited availability of data makes empirical corroboration challenging , we show that our model can fit field observations of red maple ( Acer rubrum<pathogen>) and note that the age distribution of discarded branches predicted by our model is qualitatively similar to an empirically observed distribution of dead and abscised branches of balsam poplar ( Populus balsamifera). By showing how a simple phenomenological assumption-that the number of branches a tree can maintain is limited-leads directly to predictions on branching structure and the rate and size distribution of branch loss , these results potentially enable more explicit modeling of woody tissues in ecosystems worldwide , with implications for the buildup of flammable fuel , nutrient cycling , and understanding of plant growth.
