  The aim of the study was to assess the accuracy of two plasma Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( H pylori) antibody test-systems and a stool<symptom> antigen test ( SAT) system in a general population sample in Latvia. Blood and faecal samples were analysed in healthy individuals ( 40-64 years) , referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy according to pilot study protocol within a population-based study investigating gastric cancer prevention strategies ( GISTAR pilot study). Antibodies to H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> were assessed in plasma by latex-agglutination test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> antigen in faecal samples was detected by a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay-based SAT. Histological assessment of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> based on a modified Giemsa staining method was used as the gold standard. Individuals having received H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication within one year prior to enrolment were excluded. Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV) , negative predictive value ( NPV) and overall accuracy were calculated. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were designed to estimate the optimal diagnostic cut-off value of tests. The analysis included 779 participants for latex-agglutination test , 1002 for ELISA and 672 individual samples for SAT. The sensitivity , specificity , PPV , NPV and overall accuracy were as follows: latex-agglutination test ( 86; 81; 87; 80; 84 %) , ELISA ( 97; 72; 83; 94; 86 %) and SAT ( 87; 81; 87; 81; 85 %) , respectively. The optimal diagnostic cut-off value for ELISA test was â‰¥ 50.26 g/L. Although the performance of the three tests was comparable to each other , the three test systems showed suboptimal accuracy , with important implications for public health programs based on ` test-and-treat ' strategy.
