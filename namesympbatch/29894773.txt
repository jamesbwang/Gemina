  To evaluate whether two similar en bloc thulium laser enucleation of the prostate ( ThuLEP) techniques can influence surgical complications and outcomes. Within two institutional databases164 men who underwent two different en bloc ThuLEP techniques were compared using propensity scores. With the first technique prostatic lobes were all enucleated en bloc , whereas , with the second the median lobe was enucleated first and the lateral lobes were enucleated en bloc thereafter. All patients were evaluated at baseline and 6 months after surgery with PSA , Qmax and self-administrated IPSS. Operative data and 30-day postoperative complications were gathered. Surgical time and twenty-four hour blood<symptom> loss<symptom> were similar between two groups ( 55 vs. 55 minutes , p 0.97288; -0.9 vs. -1.3 g/dl , p 0.112 respectively). Median hospital stay after surgery was 3 days in both groups ( p 0.3251). IPSS and Qmax improved equally in both groups ( median 3 vs. 3 , p 0.941; 19.17 vs. 20.63 ml/sec , p 0.8232 respectively). Early complications were mild to moderate ( Clavien I 12.2 % vs. 12.2 %; Clavien II 3.6 % vs. 4.84 %; Clavien IIIb<pathogen> 1.2 % vs. 2.4 %). Our results showed that en bloc ThuLEP approaches appear feasible , have similar complications and outcomes and can be considered surgeon-independent techniques. En bloc ThuLEP may be proposed even for laser-na√Øve urologists as an alternative to the original three-lobe technique.
