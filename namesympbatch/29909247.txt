  Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is a progressive and profound movement disorder resulting from neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system , but current treatment neither cures nor stops PD from advancing. Based on the ability to suppress oxidative stress , excitotoxicity , and neuroinflammation , the potential of honokiol as a novel neuroprotective agent for PD treatment was determined. The hemi-parkinsonian model was used to investigate the protective and therapeutic effects of honokiol on motor<symptom> dysfunctions<symptom> and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice , with a single unilateral striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine ( 6-OHDA). One day after 6-OHDA-induced lesion<symptom> , the mice exhibited spontaneous ipsilateral turning , motor imbalance , and incoordination<symptom> which were mild with a single administration of honokiol prior to 6-OHDA injection. Thereafter , honokiol was continually applied daily for 14 days , which ameliorated apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation and reduced the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive ( TH-ir) fibers in the lesioned striatum<pathogen>. In addition , honokiol posttreatment , beginning on day 8 after 6-OHDA lesion<symptom> , for 14 days efficiently rescued motor deficits and recovered the TH-ir neuronal loss in both the lesioned striatum<pathogen> and the ipsilateral substantia nigra. The 6-OHDA-induced increases in nigrostriatal expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) and decreases in that of nNOS were also reversed by honokiol posttreatment. These findings revealed that honokiol has both protective and therapeutic effects on motor impairments and dopaminergic progressive damage , at least in part through modulation of NOS signaling , in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Honokiol may represent a potential therapeutic candidate for the management of motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> and neurodegeneration in PD.
