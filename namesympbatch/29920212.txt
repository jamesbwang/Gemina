  Clostridium<pathogen> kluyveri is an anaerobic microorganism that is well-known for producing butyrate and hexanoate using ethanol and acetate. It is also an important bacterium<pathogen> in the production of Chinese strong flavour baijiu ( SFB). To obtain a comprehensive understanding of its metabolism , a curated genome-scale metabolic model ( GSMM) of C. kluyveri , including 708 genes , 994 reactions , and 804 metabolites , was constructed and named iCKL708. This model was used to simulate the growth of C. kluyveri on different carbon substrates and the results agreed well with the experimental data. The butyrate , pentanoate , and hexanoate biosynthesis pathways were also elucidated. Flux balance<symptom> analysis indicated that the ratio of ethanol to acetate , as well as the uptake rate of carbon dioxide , affected hexanoate production. The GSMM iCKL708 described here provides a platform to further our understanding and exploration of the metabolic potential of C. kluyveri.
