  An adult female of Williams ' mud turtle , Pelusios williamsi long-term captive , that was allegedly caught wild in Kenya was found to have developed papilloma-like skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. Excised tumors were examined histologically after routine processing with hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E) stained slides , examined for the presence of viral particles by electron microscopy employing negative staining , and examined for the presence of viral DNA by PCR. Microscopic features in pre-treatment biopsies were fully diagnostic and consistent with multifocal squamous cell papilloma. Viral-type inclusion bodies were not identified. Turtle was found to be infected by reptilian herpesvirus<pathogen>. Association with herpesvirus<pathogen> and vast multiplicity of tumors thwarted surgical solution. An autogenous vaccine was prepared using 5 g of excised fresh tissue , aseptically ground , treated with diluted formalin , centrifuged to obtain a supernatant , and subsequently exposed to UV light. Autogenous vaccine induced substantial areas of necrosis<symptom> of the papillomatous lesions<symptom> noted by the loss of cytological architecture , nuclear loss , and by edema<symptom>. The outer edges of the healing biopsies appeared to be regenerating. Therefore , our vaccine application could be considered as effective. It is difficult to treat and eliminate herpesvirus<pathogen> infection because of its cryptic presence and sudden onset of disease. Successful application of autogenous vaccine could be a potentially promising strategy , which deserves further testing.
