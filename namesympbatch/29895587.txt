  The US Food and Drug Administration approved sacubitril/valsartan for patients with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) with reduced ejection fraction in 2015 on the basis of the results of the PARADIGM-HF ( Prospective Comparison of ARNI ( Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitor) With ACEI ( Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor) to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom>) trial. There are limited data assessing the generalizability of PARADIGM-HF trial participants to a broader population of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction routinely encountered in outpatient clinical practice. We compared the baseline characteristics of patients in the PARADIGM-HF trial with those in the CHAMP-HF ( Change the Management of Patients With Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom>) study a large US outpatient registry of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Patients in the PARADIGM-HF trial ( n = 8442) were similar to those in the CHAMP-HF registry ( n = 3497) in terms of age ( mean , 64 versus 66 years) , sex ( 22 % versus 29 % women) , New<pathogen> York Heart Association class III to IV ( 25 % versus 32 %) , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( mean , 121 versus 121 mm Hg) , left ventricular ejection fraction ( mean , 29 % versus 29 %) , and other key baseline characteristics. The median ( 25th-75 These data suggest participants randomized in the PARADIGM-HF trial have similar baseline characteristics to those encountered in routine outpatient clinical practice , but there is a substantial lag in the adoption of sacubitril/valsartan for patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction.
