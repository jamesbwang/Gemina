  Parasite-induced behavioral changes in their hosts favor to complete the lifecycle of parasites. Schistosome infection is also known to cause physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> in infected freshwater snail intermediate hosts. Here , we report , a novel phenomenon in which Schistosoma mansoni , a highly debilitating worm affecting millions of people worldwide , alters the phototropic behavior of Biomphalaria glabrata<pathogen> , the vector snail. S. mansoni-infection enhanced positive phototropism of vector snails and infected snails spent significantly more time in light. Possibly , these behavioral changes help the parasite to be released efficiently from the infected intermediate hosts , and to infect mammalian hosts.
