  The aim of the present study was to identify key genes and signaling pathways associated with the pathogenesis of juvenile spondyloarthritis ( JSA). The gene expression profile dataset GSE58667 , including data from 15 human whole blood samples collected from 11 patients with JSA and four healthy controls , was analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) associated with disease characteristics. Additionally , Gene Ontology term and Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses of the DEGs were performed. Protein‑protein , microRNA‑transcription factor and chemical‑gene interaction networks were constructed. A total of 326 DEGs , 196 upregulated and 130 downregulated , were identified. DEGs , including C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 5 ( CXCL5) , BCL2 interacting protein 3 like ( BNIP3L) , dual specificity phosphatase 5 ( DUSP5) and tumor protein p53 ( TP53) were enriched in functions associated with apoptosis , the cell cycle and immune responses. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that pathways associated with inflammation<symptom> and the mitogen‑activated protein kinase 1 ( MAPK) signaling pathway were the most enriched by DEGs. The results of the present study indicated that the MAPK signaling pathway and four genes , including CXCL5 , BNIP3L , DUSP5 and TP53 , may be implicated in the pathogenesis of JSA.
