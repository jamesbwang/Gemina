  The aim of this study is to explore the effects of heat stresses on global gene expression profiles and to identify the candidate genes for the heat stress response in commercial baker 's yeast ( Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> by using microarray technology and comparative statistical data analyses. The data from all hybridizations and array normalization were analyzed using the GeneSpringGX 12.1 ( Agilent) and the R 2.15.2 program language. In the analysis , all required statistical methods were performed comparatively. For the normalization step , among alternatives , the RMA ( Robust Microarray Analysis) results were used. To determine differentially expressed genes under heat stress treatments , the fold-change and the hypothesis testing approaches were executed under various cut-off values via different multiple testing procedures then the up/down regulated probes were functionally categorized via the PAMSAM clustering. The results of the analysis concluded that the transcriptome changes under the heat shock<symptom>. Moreover , the temperature-shift stress treatments show that the number of differentially up-regulated genes among the heat shock<symptom> proteins and transcription factors changed significantly. Finally , the change in temperature is one of the important environmental conditions affecting propagation and industrial application of baker 's yeast. This study statistically analyzes this affect via one-channel microarray data.
