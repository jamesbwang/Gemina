  Previously , we observed increased transcription levels of specific cytochrome P450 monooxygenase ( P450) and ATP binding cassette ( ABC) transporter genes in human body lice , Pediculus<pathogen> humanus<pathogen> humanus<pathogen> , following exposure to ivermectin using the non-invasive induction assay ( NIIA) , which resulted in tolerance. To confirm the roles of these genes in induction and tolerance , the robust genetic model insect , Drosophila melanogaster , was chosen. Orthologous genes corresponding to the body louse P450 ( Cyp9f2 , Cyp6g2 and Cyp9h1) and ABC transporter ( Mrp1 , GC1824 as an ABCB type and CG3327 as an ABCG type) genes were selected for in vivo bioassay. Following a brief treatment with a sublethal dose of ivermectin , the mortality response was significantly slower , indicating the presence of tolerance. Concurrently , the transcription levels of Cyp9f2 and Mrp1 at 3 h and those of Cyp6g2 , Cyp9h1 , Mrp1 , CG1824 and CG3327 at 6 h post-treatment were up-regulated , indicating gene induction. In behavioral bioassay using GAL4/UAS-RNAi transgenic fly lines , increased susceptibility to ivermectin was observed following heat shock<symptom> in the Cyp9f2- , Cyp6g2- , Cyp9h1- , Mrp1- or CG3327-knockdown flies. Considering that these five genes are orthologous to those which had the largest over-expression level following ivermectin-induced tolerance in the body louse , the current results suggest that they are also associated with ivermectin detoxification in D. melanogaster and that body lice and D. melanogaster are likely to share , in part , similar mechanisms of tolerance to ivermectin.
