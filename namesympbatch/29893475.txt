  Patients with advanced systolic chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> frequently suffer from progressive functional mitral regurgitation. We report our initial experience in patients with an implanted pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP) sensor , who developed severe mitral regurgitation , which was treated with the MitraClip system. We non-invasively compared changes in PAP values in patients after MitraClip with PAP changes in patients without MitraClip. Among 28 patients with New<pathogen> York Heart Association III heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with implanted PAP sensor for haemodynamic telemonitoring from a single centre , four patients ( age 66 ± 6 years , left ventricular ejection fraction 21 ± 3 % , and cardiac index 1.8 ± 0.3) received a MitraClip procedure and were compared with 24 patients ( age 72 ± 8 years , left ventricular ejection fraction 26 ± 9.9 % , and cardiac index 2.0 ± 1.0) without MitraClip procedure in a descriptive manner. Ambulatory PAP values were followed for 90 days in both groups. In comparison with the PAP values 4 weeks before MitraClip procedure , PAP was profoundly reduced in all four patients after 30 days ( ΔPAPmean -11 ± 5 , ΔPAPdiast -7 ± 3 mmHg , P < 0.02) as well as after 90 days ( ΔPAPmean -6.3 ± 6 , ΔPAPdiast -1 ± 3 mmHg). Reductions in PAP were accompanied by a profound reduction in N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide as well as clinical and echocardiographic improvement. When analysing the dynamics with a regression model , reductions in all PAP values were significantly greater after MitraClip compared with conservative haemodynamic monitoring ( P < 0.001). The efficacy of the interventional MitraClip procedure on clinical symptoms can be confirmed by haemodynamic telemonitoring. Thus , daily non-invasive haemodynamic telemonitoring allows , for the first time , for a continuous assessment of the haemodynamic efficacy of novel therapies in patients with
