  The use of left ventricular assist device is associated with improvement in survival in patients with refractory heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , driveline infection limits the success of its use as it is associated with significant mortality. We describe the first 2 cases of Mycobacterium<pathogen> abscessus<pathogen> driveline infection. Both patients had persistent infection despite of aggressive antibiotic treatment and local debridement , and only improved after removal of their left ventricular assist devices.
