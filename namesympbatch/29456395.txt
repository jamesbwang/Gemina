  Ulna coronoid fracture is a complicated injury and occurred in the coronal plane. Undeniably , there is no universally accepted approach for treating ulna coronoid fractures. Therefore , this study aimed at exploring the efficacy of different surgical treatments for Regan-Morrey type II and III ulna coronoid fractures. A total of 164 patients with ulna coronoid fractures were admitted and treated in department of orthopedics at Yiwu Central Hospital , the Affiliated Yiwu Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University for retrospective analysis. The baseline features ( age , gender , time from injury to surgery and so on) before the surgery and different conditions during the surgery were compared. Following that , the Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS) pain score was employed to evaluate the severity of preoperative and postoperative pain experienced by the patients in each group. Afterwards , Broberg and Morrey elbow score was used to evaluate elbow joint function and surgical effect of the patients. Lastly , the postoperative recovery and complications were compared. It was firstly observed that internal fixation with mini<pathogen> plate and hollow screw compelled to lower average operation time and blood<symptom> loss<symptom> than Kirschner wire and steel wire suture. Next , the severity of postoperative pain was lessened in comparison with preoperative pain. Afterwards , mini<pathogen> plate and hollow screw improved elbow joint function more notable than Kirschner wire and steel wire suture , and Kirschner wire and steel wire suture resulted in higher incidence of complications and worse postoperative recovery. Collectively , this study clarified that for the treatment of Regan-Morrey type II and III ulna coronoid fractures , internal fixation with mini<pathogen> plate and hollow screw has an overall superior surgical effect than internal fixation with Kirschner wire and steel wire suture.
