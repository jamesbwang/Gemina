  The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) development after treatment with direct-acting antivirals ( DAAs) and to compare HCC occurrence in these patients with that among patients treated with interferon ( IFN)- based therapies. We analyzed a large cohort with chronic hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> patients for the onset of new HCC after DAA treatment. A historical IFN-treated cohort was investigated for comparison. A total of 819 patients were included in the DAA group. The median follow-up period was 263 days ( 0-1,001). Twenty-five patients ( 3.6 HCCs/100 person-years; 3.1 %) were diagnosed with de novo HCC within the time of observation. No patient without cirrhosis had developed HCC. Patients with newly diagnosed HCC were mostly male , older , and treatment-experienced and had a lower 12-week sustained virologic response ( SVR12) rate and higher levels of liver inflammation<symptom> markers. The median time to HCC was 312 days ( 0-880). Investigation of the subcohort of 269 cirrhotic patients yielded an HCC rate of 8.9 HCCs/100 person-years. In this cohort , non-SVR12 was an independent risk factor for de novo HCC ( HR 4.48; 95 % CI 1.51-13.12; The de novo HCC rates did not differ between the DAA-treated patients and those who received IFN. Achievement of SVR is of utmost importance for HCC prevention.
