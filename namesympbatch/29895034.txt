  Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> is a gram-positive , anaerobic spore-forming , toxin-producing bacillus<pathogen> , which is one of the most common causes for health care-associated infections. High colonization rates in clinically asymptomatic neonates and infants have been described , although most studies go back to the early 1980 and 1990s , and were carried out in term and late preterm infants. The aim of our study was to determine both the impact and time course of C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> colonization in a cohort of very low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight infants ( VLBWI) in an era of PCR-based technologies for diagnosis. Stool<symptom> samples of VLBWI were analyzed for the presence of C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> strains in regular intervals during the hospital stay by PCR ribotyping. Analysis was continued throughout the first 2 years of life. A 32 % C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> colonization rate during the first 2 years of life and an in-hospital colonization rate of 8 % was found in a cohort of 190 VLBWI. C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> colonization occurred mainly in the first 6 months of life , which was similar to term neonates. In-hospital colonization accounted for only a small percentage of cases with no detection of hypervirulent strains. Also , C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> colonization was not related to an adverse outcome in this VLBWI cohort. Oral lactoferrin of bovine origin and treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam were negatively correlated with C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> colonization in our study. C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> colonization in our cohort of VLBWI was significantly lower than has been described in the literature and was not related to an adverse outcome.
