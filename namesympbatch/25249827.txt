  In the theory of superconducting junctions , Green<symptom> 's function has an important role for obtaining Andreev bound states , local density of states and Josephson current in a systematic way. In this article , we show how to construct Green<symptom> 's function on the surface of a topological insulator following McMillan 's formalism where the energy spectrum of electrons obeys a linear dispersion. For a model of a superconductor ( S)/ ferromagnet ( F<pathogen>)/ normal metal ( N) junction , we show that the generation of a Majorana fermion gives rise to the enhanced local density of states and pair amplitude of odd-frequency pairing. We also derive an extended Furusaki-Tsukada 's formula of DC Josephson current in S/F/S junctions. The obtained Josephson current depends on the direction and magnitude of the magnetization.This article is part of the theme issue ` Andreev bound states '.
