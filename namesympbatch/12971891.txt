  Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. Progressive<symptom> loss<symptom> of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra ( SN) and their synaptic terminal connections in the striatum<pathogen> are main characterizations of PD. Although many efforts have been made to develop therapeutics , no treatment has been proven effective. We previously demonstrated that bvPLA2 can protect dopaminergic neurons by modulating neuroinflammatory responses in an MPTP ( 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)- induced mouse model of PD. The cellular basis for the neuroprotective response of bvPLA2 was the induction of CD4
