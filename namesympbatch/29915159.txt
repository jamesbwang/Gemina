  To clarify the significance of circulating tumor cells ( CTC) undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) patients , we used an advanced CanPatrol ™ CTC-enrichment technique and in situ hybridization ( ISH) to enrich and classify CTC from blood samples. 101 of 112 ( 90.18 %) HCC patients were CTC-positive , even with early-stage disease. CTC were also detected in 2 of 12 hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) patients , both of whom had small HCC tumors detected within 5 months. CTC count ≥ 16 and mesenchymal-CTC ( M-CTC) percentage ≥ 2 % prior to resection were significantly associated with early recurrence , multi-intrahepatic recurrence , and lung metastasis. Postoperative CTC monitoring in 10 patients found that most had an increased CTC count and M-CTC percentage before clinically detectable recurrence nodules<symptom> appeared. Analysis of HCC with high CTC count and high M-CTC percentage identified 67 differentially expressed cancer-related genes involved in cancer-related biological pathways ( e.g. cell adhesion and migration , tumor angiogenesis , and apoptosis). One of the identified genes , BCAT1 , was significantly upregulated , and knockdown in Hepg2 , Hep3B , and Huh7 cells reduced cell proliferation , migration , and invasion while promoting apoptosis. A concomitant increase in epithelial marker expression ( EpCAM and E-cadherin) and reduced mesenchymal marker expression ( vimentin and Twist) suggests that BCAT1 may trigger the EMT process. Overall , CTC were highly correlated with HCC characteristics , representing a novel marker for early diagnosis and a prognostic factor for early recurrence. BCAT1 overexpression may induce CTC release by triggering EMT and may be an important biomarker of HCC metastasis.
