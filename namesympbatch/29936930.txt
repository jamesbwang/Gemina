  Secondary prevention via earlier detection would afford the greatest chance for a cure in premalignant lesions<symptom>. We investigated the exomic profiles of non-malignant and malignant changes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) and the genomic blueprint of human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>)- driven carcinogenesis in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC). Whole-exome ( WES) and whole-genome ( WGS) sequencing were performed on peripheral blood and adjacent non-tumor and tumor specimens obtained from eight Korean HNSCC patients from 2013 to 2015. Next-generation sequencing yielded an average coverage of 94.3 × for WES and 35.3 × for WGS. In comparative genomic analysis of non-tumor and tumor tissue pairs , we were unable to identify common cancer-associated early mutations and copy number alterations ( CNA) except in one pair. Interestingly , in this case , we observed that non-tumor tonsillar crypts adjacent to HPV-positive OPSCC appeared normal under a microscope; however , this tissue also showed weak p16 expression. WGS revealed the infection and integration of high-risk type HPV16 in this tissue as well as in the matched tumor. Furthermore , WES identified shared and tumor-specific genomic alterations for this pair. Clonal analysis enabled us to infer the process by which this transitional crypt epithelium ( TrCE) evolved into a tumor; this evolution was accompanied by the subsequent accumulation of genomic alterations , including an ERBB3 mutation and large-scale CNAs , such as 3q27-qter amplification and 9p deletion. We suggest that HPV16-driven OPSCC carcinogenesis is a stepwise evolutionary process that is consistent with a multistep carcinogenesis model. Our results highlight the carcinogenic changes driven by HPV16 infection and provide a basis for the secondary prevention of OPSCC.
