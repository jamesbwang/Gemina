  It is increasingly evident that the brain is not truly an immune privileged site and that cells of the central nervous system are sensitive to the inflammation<symptom> generated when the brain is fighting off infection. Among the many microorganisms that have access to the brain , the apicomplexan protozoan Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> has been one of the most studied. This parasite has been associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. This article provides a comprehensive review of the status of Toxoplasma research in schizophrenia. Areas of interest include ( 1) the limitations and improvements of immune-based assays to detect these infections in humans , ( 2) recent discoveries concerning the schizophrenia-Toxoplasma association , ( 3) findings of Toxoplasma neuropathology in animal models related to schizophrenia pathogenesis , ( 4) interactions of Toxoplasma with the host genome , ( 5) gastrointestinal effects of Toxoplasma infections , and ( 6) therapeutic intervention of Toxoplasma infections.
