  Due to the significant role of the periosteum in bone regeneration , we hypothesised that using a specially engineered artificial periosteum could lead to an enhancement in osteogenesis in bone grafts. Herein , we describe our work aimed at fabricating an electrospun fibrous membrane as an artificial periosteum that exhibits flexibility , permeability and osteoinduction. This membrane was designed to cover the complex surface of bone grafts to facilitate and accelerate bone regeneration. The traditional Chinese medicine icariin ( ICA) was subsequently introduced into poly ( Îµ-caprolactone) ( PCL)/ gelatin nanofibers to fabricate an artificial periosteum for the first time. The effects of ICA content on morphology , physical properties , drug release profile , in vitro degradability , biocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation properties were investigated. The ICA-loaded electrospun membranes<symptom> showed significant improvement in hydrophilicity , high mechanical strength , appropriate degradation rates and excellent biocompatibility. Furthermore , clear enhancement in alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) activity , as well as an increase in osteocalcin ( OCN) and type collagen I ( COL<pathogen> I) expression in MC3T3-E1 cells were detected. Furthermore , we observed clear calcium deposition content in MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on ICA-loaded fibrous matrix. The membrane loaded with 0.05 wt. % ICA displayed properties contributing to cell attachment , proliferation and differentiation. These results indicate the huge potential of this ICA-loaded PCL/gelatin electrospun membrane as a biomimetic artificial periosteum to accelerate bone regeneration.
