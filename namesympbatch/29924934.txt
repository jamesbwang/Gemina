  Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing protein-nucleic acid interactions is fundamental to many nuclear processes. However , how nucleic acid binding affects the conformation and dynamics of the substrate protein remains poorly understood. Here we use a combination of single molecule force spectroscopy AFM and biochemical assays to show that the binding of TG-rich ssDNA<pathogen> triggers a mechanical switch in the RRM1 domain of TDP-43 , toggling between an entropic spring devoid of mechanical stability and a shock<symptom> absorber bound-form that resists unfolding forces of âˆ¼ 40 pN. The fraction of mechanically resistant proteins correlates with an increasing length of the TG
