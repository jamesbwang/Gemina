  Corticofugal fibers target the subthalamic nucleus ( STN) , a component nucleus of the basal ganglia , in addition to the striatum<pathogen> , their main input. The cortico-subthalamic , or hyperdirect , pathway , is thought to supplement the cortico-striatal pathways in order to interrupt/change planned actions. To explore the previously unknown properties of the neurons that project to the STN , retrograde and anterograde tools were used to specifically identify them in the motor cortex and selectively stimulate their synapses in the STN. The cortico-subthalamic neurons exhibited very little sag and fired an initial doublet followed by non-adapting action potentials. In the STN , AMPA/kainate synaptic currents had a voltage-dependent conductance , indicative of GluA2-lacking receptors and were partly inhibited by Naspm. AMPA transmission displayed short-term depression<symptom> , with the exception of a limited bandpass in the 5 to 15 Hz range. AMPA synaptic currents were negatively controlled by dopamine D5 receptors. The reduction in synaptic strength was due to postsynaptic D5 receptors , mediated by a PKA-dependent pathway , but did not involve a modified rectification index. Our data indicated that dopamine , through post-synaptic D5 receptors , limited the cortical drive onto STN neurons in the normal brain.
