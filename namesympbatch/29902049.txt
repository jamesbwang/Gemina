  Suicide is a major public health problem , claiming the lives of more than 40,000 individuals in the United States each year. Efforts are needed to ( a) identify those at heightened risk for suicide , utilizing objective assessment methods and ( b) determine factors that may be protective against engaging in suicidal behavior , even in the context of the desire to do so. Scales RCd ( demoralization) and RC9<pathogen> ( hypomanic activation) of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ( MMPI) -2 Restructured Form ( MMPI-2-RF) may be valuable in this regard. Whereas individuals high on both RCd and RC9<pathogen> are dysphoric and prone to reckless action , individuals high on RCd but low on RC9<pathogen> are characterized by levels of high lethargy<symptom> and physical unexcitability that may be protective against making a suicide attempt. The purpose of this study was to determine whether scales RCd and RC9<pathogen> of the MMPI-2-RF interact to predict suicide attempts among suicide ideators. Participants were 189 psychiatric outpatients between the ages of 18 and 65 years ( M = 28.8 , SD = 11.8; 68.8 % female , 74.5 % non-Hispanic White) who reported nonzero levels of suicidal ideation on the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. Overall , 46.6 % of patients reported a past suicide attempt. Consistent with hypotheses , RCd and RC9<pathogen> interacted such that elevations on RCd were positively associated with past suicide attempts at high , but not low , levels of RC9<pathogen>. Alternate models demonstrated that this configuration persisted when examining the ACT Specific Problem scale as a surrogate for RC9<pathogen>. This study presents a novel MMPI-2-RF configuration that may enhance the assessment of suicide risk. ( PsycINFO Database Record
