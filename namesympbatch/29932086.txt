  Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> ( Ct) and human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) are the most common sexually transmitted pathogens. Whereas it is well known that infection with oncogenic HPV<pathogen> genotypes increases the risk of cervical cancer ( CC) , the implication of Ct in the pathogenesis of CC is still controversial. Hence , to investigate the possible implication of Ct infection alone , or with concomitant HPV<pathogen> infection , in the severity of cervical<symptom> lesions<symptom> , we conducted a study in 164 Caucasian HIV-negative women with abnormal Pap. Genomic HPV<pathogen> and Ct DNA were detected in 97 ( 59 %) and 16 ( 10 %) women respectively , and 15 ( 9 %) of women were infected by both. Of the HPV<pathogen> positive samples , 89 ( 79 %) were HR-HPV types or probable HR types and HPV16 was the most represented genotype. Interestingly , it was observed that co-infection was more frequent than HPV<pathogen> infection alone in women with high grade
