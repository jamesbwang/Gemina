  Factors influencing N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) level in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients with different cardiac functions were identified to explore the correlations with prognosis. Eighty heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients with different cardiac functions treated in Yixing People 's Hospital from January 2016 to June 2017 were selected , and divided into two groups ( group with cardiac function in class II and below and group with cardiac function in class III and above) , according to the cardiac function classification established by New<pathogen> York Heart Association ( NYHA). Blood biochemical test and outcome analysis were conducted to measure serum NT-proBNP and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9) levels in patients with different cardiac functions , and correlations between levels of NT-proBNP and MMP-9 and left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) level were analyzed in patients with different cardiac functions at the same time. In addition , risk factors for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in patients with different cardiac functions were analyzed. Compared with the group with cardiac function in class III and above , the group with cardiac function in class II and below had significantly lower serum NT-proBNP and MMP-9 levels ( p < 0.05). For echocardiogram indexes , left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ( LVEDD) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter ( LVESD) in the group with cardiac function in class II and below were obviously lower than those in the group with cardiac function in class III and above ( p < 0.05) , while LVEF was higher in group with cardiac function in class II and below than that in group with cardiac function in class III and above ( p < 0.05). NT-proBNP and MMP-9 levels were negatively correlated with LVEF level ( r = -0.8517 and -0.8517 , respectively , p < 0.001 ( < 0.05)). Cardiac function in class III and above , increased NT-proBNP , increased MMP-9 and decreased LVEF were relevant risk factors and independent risk factors for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in patients with different cardiac functions. NT-proBNP and MMP-9 levels are negatively correlated with LVEF in patients regardless of the cardiac function class. Therefore , attention should be paid to patients who have cardiac function in class III and above , increased NT-proBNP and MMP-9 levels and decreased LVEF in clinical practices , so as to actively prevent and treat
