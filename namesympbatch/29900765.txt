  To better understand the clinical pathology , diseases , and causes of mortality of reintroduced American martens ( Martes americana<pathogen>) in Michigan , a study was conducted from 2011 to 2015 in the Upper<symptom> and Lower<symptom> Peninsulas of Michigan. Samples obtained from live trapping ( n = 58) or harvested carcasses ( n = 34) were serologically tested for select pathogens. Antibodies against Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> and canine distemper virus were detected in 58 and 3.4 % of samples , respectively. All samples were seronegative for Leptospira<pathogen> spp. and negative for Dirofilaria immitis<pathogen> antigen. Urine samples tested for Leptospira<pathogen> spp. via immunofluorescent antibody assay ( n = 7) , polymerase chain reaction ( n = 6) , or both ( n = 3) were all negative. Parvovirus DNA was detected in 9.1 % of small intestine samples ( n = 22) collected from carcasses and in 3.7 % of fecal samples ( n = 27) collected during live trapping. Complete blood counts ( n = 64) and serum biochemistries ( n = 63) were obtained from 49 live-trapped martens. Biochemical parameters found to be significantly different ( P < 0.05) between genders were calcium , creatinine , glucose , and phosphorus. There was no significant difference between genders for any hematologic parameter. Significant differences ( P < 0.05) between summer and winter seasons were found in total estimated white blood cell count , neutrophils , lymphocytes , monocytes , alkaline phosphatase , bicarbonate , calcium , creatinine , globulin , glucose , phosphorus , potassium , sodium , and total protein. There was no significant difference in blood cell count or serum biochemistry values between radio-collared ( n = 17) and noncollared ( n = 47) martens. Animals seropositive for T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> were found to have significantly higher ( P < 0.05) eosinophil and globulin levels than seronegative animals. The primary natural cause for mortality of radio-collared American martens was predation. Histologic examinations revealed a high percentage ( 60 %) of martens with verminous or granulomatous
