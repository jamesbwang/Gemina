  Studies have shown that high exposure to fluoride ( NaF) induces neurotoxicity. Rutin ( RUT) , a citrus flavonoid , has been reported to have antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective mechanism ( s) of RUT on NaF- induced neurotoxicity. Rats were exposed to NaF alone in drinking water at 15 mg/L alone ad libitum or orally co-treated by gavage with RUT at 50 and 100 mg/kg body<symptom> weight for 31 consecutive days. A video-tracking software was used to monitor the motor and locomotive behavior during a 5- min trial time in a novel environment. Thereafter , acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) activity , oxidative stress markers , pro-inflammatory cytokines and caspase- 3 activity were determined in the cerebrum and striatum<pathogen>. The result indicates that NaF- induced neurobehavioral deficits. RUT mediated the reversal of the neurobehavioral deficits and enhanced the exploratory profile of NaF- treated rats as supported by the track plot analyses. Moreover , RUT attenuated the NaF- induced inhibition of antioxidant enzymes and AChE activity and inhibits lipid peroxidation , neuro-inflammation and apoptosis in the cerebrum and striatum<pathogen> of the rats. Collectively , the present study demonstrated that RUT attenuates NaF- Induced toxicity in the cerebrum and striatum<pathogen> of rats via mechanisms involving enhancement of AChE activity , antioxidant status with concomitant inhibition of lipid peroxidation , neuro-inflammation and apoptosis in rats. RUT may be used as a neuroprotective agent against NaF- induced neurotoxicity.
