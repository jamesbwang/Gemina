  Despite apparent sex differences in the development and treatment of alcohol use disorder , relatively little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. In this study we therefore investigated neural cue-reactivity in a sample of male ( n = 28) and female ( n = 27) problem drinkers ( matched on age and alcohol use severity) with an average alcohol use disorder identification test score of 12 which is indicative of a likely alcohol use disorder. Neural cue-reactivity data were extracted from four regions of interest: the ventral and dorsal striatum<pathogen> and the ventral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , with a significance level set at p < 0.05. While the cue-reactivity paradigm induced similar levels of self-reported craving in males and females , visual alcohol-cues induced significantly stronger striatal activation in male compared to drinkers. While sex differences in ventral striatal cue-reactivity were partly explained by sex differences in alcohol intake , cannabis use , negative affect and anxiety<symptom> , this was not the case for sex differences in dorsal striatal cue-reactivity. These results suggest that alcohol cues are differentially processed by men and women and that the neurobiological mechanisms behind cue reactivity differ between the sexes. Consequently , paradigms using alcohol-related pictures may not be optimal to induce cue-reactivity in female drinkers and may not be optimal to measure neurobiological markers of alcohol use severity and relapse. Future alcohol-cue reactivity studies should , in addition to including both males and females , include different types of cues ( e.g. stressors and imagery in addition to pictures) to assess sex differences in alcohol cue-reactivity.
