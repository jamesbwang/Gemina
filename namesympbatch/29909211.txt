  Long-term effectiveness of selective ventralis intermedius<pathogen> ( VIM)- ventralis oralis<pathogen> ( VO) thalamotomy with depth microrecording for the treatment of focal dystonia was evaluated. The optimal thalamic areas for controlling focal dystonia were studied based on the electrophysiological and anatomical data. Stereotactic selective VIM-VO thalamotomy with depth microrecording was carried out in 8 patients with focal arm and hand dystonia and in one patient with cervical dystonia. Electrophysiological data on the lateral part of thalamic VIM was studied in patients with focal dystonia. A very small and narrow therapeutic lesion<symptom> was formed in the shape of a square on the sagittal plane and of an I , rotated V , Y or inverse Y on the axial plane in the VIM-VO , which covered the kinesthetic response area topographically related to focal dystonia. Patients with arm and hand dystonia were followed up for 4.7 Â± 3.0 years and one patient with cervical dystonia for 18.2 years. Marked improvement of focal dystonia was revealed by functional assessment using the Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. Transient dysarthria<symptom> was recognized in one patient. The sequence of body localization of kinesthetic response in the VIM was clearly demonstrated in patients with focal dystonia. Decreases in the amplitude and amplitude ratio of electromyography on the forearm muscles were markedly significant after VIM thalamotomy , but insignificant after VO thalamotomy immediately following VIM thalamotomy. Marked reduction of EMG tonic discharges of focal dystonia was revealed after VIM lesioning. Selective VIM-VO thalamotomy showed good and long-term stable effects for focal dystonia.
