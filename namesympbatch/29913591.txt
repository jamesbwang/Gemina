  The investigations on their variation and distribution of 13 called waste-water marking pharmaceuticals ( WWMPs) were conducted under 4 hydrophyte conditions ( without plants , with submerged aquatic plant ( Myriophyllum verticillatum L.) , emergent aquatic plant cattail ( Typha orientalis<pathogen> Presl) and floating aquatic plant ( Lemna minor L.)) in a simulated urban river system. By the calculation of mass balance<symptom> , the quantitative distribution of WWMPs in water phase , sediment and plant tissues was identified , and the overall removal efficiencies of target pharmaceuticals in the whole system could be determined. Without plants , high persistence of atenolol ( ATL) ( 97.7 %) , carbamazepine ( CBM) ( 102.8 %) , clofibric acid ( CLF) ( 101.8 %) and ibuprofen ( IBU) ( 80.9 %) was detected in water phase , while triclosan ( TCS) ( 53.5 %) displayed strong adsorption affinity in sediment. The removal under the planted conditions was considerably raised , compared with no plant condition for most WWMPs. However , TCS did not show obvious differences among the hydrophyte conditions due to its strong adsorption affinity and high hydrophobicity. The relatively higher removal was found for the hydrophilic ( logK
