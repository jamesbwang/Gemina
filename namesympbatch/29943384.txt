  Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) can be detected in most of cervical cancers. Due to antiviral , antimutagenic , and proapoptotic activities of myrtle , this study was designed to investigate the effect of a herbal suppository based on myrtle in cervicovaginal HPV<pathogen> infections. This study was performed as a double-blind randomized trial at the Clinic of Traditional Medicine in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences between 2016 and 2017. Sixty women , 18 to 50 years old , with cervicovaginal HPV<pathogen> infection , were included and randomly allocated to two groups. Sixty placebo or herbal vaginal suppositories were prescribed for 3 months ( 20 suppositories at each menstrual cycle). Each herbal vaginal suppository contained 10 % of myrtle aqueous extract and 0.5 % of myrtle essential oil. The HPV<pathogen> test and colposcopic findings were evaluated after treatment. There was no difference between two groups as regards lesion<symptom> site , diagnosis time of disease , and HPV<pathogen> type before intervention ( p â‰¥ 0.05). At the end of the study , the HPV<pathogen> test was negative in 92.6 % and 62.6 % of the intervention and placebo groups , respectively ( p = 0.036). The change in cervical<symptom> lesion<symptom> size was 71.4 % and 30.4 % in the intervention and placebo groups , respectively , based on colposcopic findings ( p = 0.015). It seems that herbal suppository can speed up virus clearance and can be effective in treating HPV<pathogen> infection.
