  A network analysis approach to psychopathology regards symptoms as mutually interacting components of a multifaceted system ( Borsboom & Cramer , 2013). Although several studies using this approach have examined comorbidity between disorders using cross-sectional samples , a direct application of the network analysis approach to intraindividual dynamic relations between symptoms in a complex<pathogen> , comorbid case has not been reported. The current article describes an intraindividual dynamic network analysis ( IDNA) approach to understanding the psychopathology of an individual using dynamic ( over time) lead-lag interrelations between symptoms. Multivariate time series data were utilized to create and examine an intraindividual , lag-1 network of the partial , day-to-day relations of symptoms in an individual with comorbid mood and anxiety<symptom> disorders. Characteristics of the network , including centrality indices , stability , dynamic processes between symptoms , and their implications for clinical assessment are described. Additional clinical implications and future directions for IDNA , including the potential incremental validity of this assessment approach for empirically-based idiographic assessment and personalized treatment planning , are discussed. This person-specific IDNA approach may be especially useful in complex<pathogen> and comorbid cases.
