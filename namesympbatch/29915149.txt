  Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by the progressive<symptom> loss<symptom> of functional dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway in the brain. While current treatments provide only symptomatic relief , gene therapy has the potential to slow or halt the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in PD patients. Adeno-associated viruses ( AAV) are vectors of choice in gene therapy due to their well-characterized safety and efficacy profiles; however , while gene therapy has been successful in preclinical models of the disease , clinical trials in humans have failed to demonstrate efficacy. Significantly , all primary AAV receptors of the virus are glycans. We thus hypothesize that age related changes in glycan receptors of heparan sulfate ( HS) proteoglycans ( receptor for rAAV2) , and/or N-glycans with terminal galactose ( receptor for rAAV9) results in poor adeno-associated virus binding in either the striatum<pathogen> or substantia nigra , or both , affecting transduction and gene delivery. To test our hypothesis we analyzed the striatum<pathogen> and substantia nigra for changes in HS , N-glycans and proteomic signatures in young versus aged rat brain striatum<pathogen> and substantia nigra.We observed different brain region-specific HS disaccharide profiles in aged compared to young adult rats for brain region-specific profiles in striatum<pathogen> versus substantia nigra. We observed brain region- and age-specific N-glycan compositional profiles with respect to the terminal galactose units that serve as receptors for AAV9. We also observed brain region-specific changes in protein expression in the aging nigrostriatal pathway. These studies provide insight into age- and brain region-specific changes in glycan receptors and proteome that will inform design of improved viral vectors for PD gene therapy.
