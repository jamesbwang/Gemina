  mRNA has an important role in spermatogenesis and the maintenance of fertility , and may act as a potential biomarker for the clinical diagnosis of infertility<symptom>. In the present study , potential biomarkers associated with teratozoospermia were screened through systemic bioinformatics analysis. Initially , genome‑wide expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus and primary analysis was conducted using R software , which included preprocessing of raw microarray data , transformation between probe ID and gene symbol and identification of differentially expressed genes. Subsequently , a functional enrichment analysis was conducted using the Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery to investigate the biological processes involved in the development of teratozoospermia. Finally , a protein‑protein interaction network of notable differentially expressed genes was constructed and cross‑analysis performed for multiple datasets , to obtain a potential biomarker for teratozoospermia. It was observed that G protein subunit β 3 , G protein subunit α o1 and G protein subunit g transducin 1 were upregulated and enriched using Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) in the network and in cross analysis. Furthermore , ribosomal protein S3 ( RPS3) , RPS5 , RPS6 , RPS16 and RPS23 were downregulated and enriched using KEGG in teratozoospermia. In conclusion , the results of the present study identified several mRNAs involved in sperm morphological development , which may aid in the understanding and treatment of
