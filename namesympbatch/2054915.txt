  In India , integrated biological and behavioral surveillance was carried out in 2014-2015 among high-risk key population as a part of second-generation HIV<pathogen> surveillance system. Computer-assisted personal interviewing and integrated information management system were used for the first time in this large national field based survey. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses<symptom> of technology use in this survey. Mixed methods comprising of the key informant 's interviews and structured data collected from field interviewers were used to do the strengths , weaknesses<symptom> , opportunities , and threats analysis with defined attributes. Despite the challenges , the technology use in this survey was a huge success with respect to data coverage , response rates , real-time data , and acceptance by respondents. However , such techniques require more focus on the competency of human resource , training , and concurrent evaluation systems to get better data quality , time adherence , and effective use of technology. The recommendations resulted from this analysis will help for strategic management while designing such systems in field-based community surveys.
