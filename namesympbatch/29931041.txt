  Severe uterine damage and infection lead to intrauterine adhesions , which result in hypomenorrhea , amenorrhea and infertility<symptom>. Cell sheet engineering has shown great promise in clinical applications. Adipose-derived stem cells ( ADSCs) are emerging as an alternative source of stem cells for cell-based therapies. In the present study , we investigated the feasibility of applying ADSCs as seed cells to form scaffold-free cell sheet. Data showed that ADSC sheets expressed higher levels of FGF , Col<pathogen> I , TGFÎ² and VEGF than ADSCs in suspension , while increased expression of this gene set was associated with stemness , including Nanog , Oct4 and Sox2. We then investigated the therapeutic effects of 3D ADSCs sheet on regeneration in a rat model. We found that ADSCs were mainly detected in the basal layer of the regenerating endometrium in the cell sheet group at 21 days after transplantation. Additionally , some ADSCs differentiated into stromal-like cells. Moreover , ADSC sheets transplanted into partially excised uteri promoted regeneration of the endometrium cells , muscle cells and stimulated angiogenesis , and also resulted in better pregnancy outcomes. Therefore , ADSC sheet therapy shows considerable promise as a new treatment for severe uterine damage.
