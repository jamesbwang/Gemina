  This study was conducted to investigate the pathological changes and distribution of B.<pathogen> melitensis<pathogen> in the urinary tract of pregnant goats following acute experimental infection. Six Jamnapari crossbred does in their third trimester of pregnancy were randomly assigned into two groups; Group 1 was uninfected control and Group 2 was inoculated conjunctival with 0.1 mL of the inoculums containing 10 None of the goats showed clinical signs or gross lesions<symptom>. The most consistent histopathology finding was the infiltration of mononuclear cells , chiefly the macrophages with few lymphocytes and occasionally neutrophils in all organs along the urinary tract of the infected goats of Group 2. Other histopathology findings included mild<symptom> necrosis<symptom> of the epithelial cells of the renal tubules , congestion<symptom> and occasional haemorrhages in the various tissues. Kidneys showed the most severe<symptom> lesions<symptom>. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed the presence of B.<pathogen> melitensis<pathogen> within the infiltrating macrophages and the epithelium of renal tubules , ureter , urethra and urinary bladder. Most extensive distribution was observed in the urinary bladder. Brucella<pathogen> melitensis<pathogen> was successfully isolated at low concentration ( 3.4 Ã— 10 This study demonstrates the presence of low concentrations of B.<pathogen> melitensis<pathogen> in the organs of urinary tract of pregnant does , resulting in mild histopathology lesions<symptom>. However , B.<pathogen> melitensis<pathogen> was not isolated from the urine that was collected from the urinary bladder.
