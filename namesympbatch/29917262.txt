  Plasmablastic lymphoma ( PBL) is a high-grade lymphoma that often affects the oral cavity of HIV-positive patients; however , its prognostic determinants remain unknown. To integrate the available data on oral PBL to determine its clinicopathological features and to identify potential prognostic factors. An electronic systematic review was performed using multiple databases with a specific search strategy in February 2018. Inclusion criteria comprised cases diagnosed as PBL affecting the oral cavity and gnathic bones with sufficient data to confirm the diagnoses. A total of 70 publications were included , representing 153 cases. Oral PBL predominantly affected HIV-positive males ( 76.4 %). EBV was observed in 63.4 % of the cases. The gingiva was the most involved site and the lesion<symptom> usually presented as an asymptomatic swelling. Most cases were classified as stage I ( 21.6 %) , and chemotherapy alone was applied in 28.8 % of the cases. There was a significant association between HIV<pathogen> and EBV infections , and cases affecting HIV-negative patients were more common in older individuals. Cumulative survival of the patients achieved 42.4 % and 33.5 % after 2 and 5 years , respectively. Although there were no statistically significant clinicopathological parameters in the univariate analysis , the multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that EBV-positive status , presence of B-symptoms , and chemotherapy alone were independent prognostic determinants of a poor prognosis. Oral PBL is an aggressive neoplasm with low survival rates , which is influenced by the presence of EBV , presence of B-symptoms , and with the use of chemotherapy only.
