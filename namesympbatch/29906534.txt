  Atherosclerosis ( AS) is the key cause of many cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The inflammatory response and lipid metabolism disorders contribute to the development and progression of AS. This work aims to study the anti-inflammatory effect and mechanism of low molecular weight fucoidan ( LMWF) obtained from Saccharina japonica<pathogen> on atherosclerosis in apoE-knockout mice. The experimental results showed that LMWF statistically decreased the levels of triglyceride ( TRIG) and oxidative low-density lipoproteins ( ox-LDL) and stabilized established atherosclerotic lesions<symptom>. LMWF ameliorated the inflammatory response by down regulating IL-6 and by up regulating IL-10 transcriptional levels , and LMWF returned p-JNK and cyclin D1 to normal levels. Moreover , LMWF increased the mRNA level of CD11b in the aorta and suppressed the expression of CD11b in the intimal layer of the aorta. Therefore , LMWF prevented macrophages from developing into foam cells and prevented SMCs from migrating into the intimal layer of the aorta , which inhibited the formation of atherosclerotic plaques; and ameliorated the occurrence and development of AS.
