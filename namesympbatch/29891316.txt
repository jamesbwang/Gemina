  In this study , the antifungal activity of chitosan derivatives against A.<pathogen> flavus<pathogen> was studied to understand the contribution of the molecular mass ( Mw) and of the hydrophobic and electrostatic forces to the inhibition of fungal growth. The interaction of amphiphilics ranging from 8 to 130 kDa with model membranes<symptom> of zwitterionic L-α-phosphatidylcholine ( PC) and anionic L-α-phosphatidylcholine/L-α-phosphatidyl- DL-glycerol ( PC: PG , 80:20 mol %) were exploited to obtain information on the inhibition mechanism. The results indicated that concurrent interactions control the antifungal activity. The decrease in the Mw weakens the self-association favoring the electrostatic and hydrophobic associations with the cell wall and anionic lipids of the lipid bilayer , indicating an increasing association of the amphiphilics with the fungal membrane. Laser confocal scanning microscopy of rhodamine labeled-derivatives and transmission electronic microscopy techniques showed that the amphiphilics affect the cell wall integrity by inducing the aggregation of hydrophobic constituents of the conidia.
