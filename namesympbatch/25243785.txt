  Contemporary strategies to curtail the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> include screening for and treating asymptomatic infections in high-prevalence populations in whom antimicrobial drug-resistant infections have typically emerged. We argue that antimicrobial resistance in these groups is driven by a combination of dense sexual network connectivity and antimicrobial drug exposure ( for example , through screen-and-treat strategies for asymptomatic N.<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> infection). Sexual network connectivity sustains a high-equilibrium prevalence of N.<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> and increases likelihood of reinfection , whereas antimicrobial drug exposure results in selection pressure for reinfecting N.<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> strains to acquire antimicrobial resistance genes from commensal pharyngeal<symptom> or rectal flora. We propose study designs to test this hypothesis.
