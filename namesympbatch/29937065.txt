  Nonallergic rhinitis ( NAR) describes chronic symptoms of nasal<symptom> congestion<symptom> , obstruction , and rhinorrhea unrelated to a specific allergen based on skin or serum testing. Vasomotor rhinitis is the most frequent subtype of NAR. Although medical management is the first-line treatment of NAR , there is a role for surgical therapy when medications fail to improve symptoms. Surgical options for NAR include inferior turbinate reduction and botulinum<pathogen> toxin injection as well as more directed targeting of the autonomic nerve supply to the nasal cavity through vidian neurectomy , posterior nasal neurectomy , and cryoablation of the posterior nerve.
