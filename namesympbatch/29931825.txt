  The use of Chinese medicines ( CMs) during pregnancy has long been a major public health concern. Although CMs have been shown to be effective in treating infertility<symptom> and preventing miscarriage , their use has been restricted , mainly because of limited knowledge of their potential toxicity. Accurate toxicology data are urgently required to assess whether these CMs are safe for maternal health and fetal development. Amniotic fluid ( AF) contains carbohydrates , lipids and phospholipids , urea and proteins , all of which aid in the growth of the fetus<pathogen> and reflect the mother 's health status as well. The changes in metabolomic patterns of AF are related to pathophysiological occurrences during the course of pregnancy. In this review , we provide a summary of the research performed in recent years on metabolomic AF samples , and use our previous study as an example to explore the feasibility of metabolomics of AF to evaluate the safety of CMs during pregnancy. We believe that metabolomics of AF play a far more important role than traditional morphology methods in the safety evaluation of CMs for pregnancy , with a higher sensitivity and correlation.
