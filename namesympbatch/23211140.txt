  Botulinum<pathogen> toxin injection chemodenervation is a well-established intervention for adult strabismus , and has also been recognised as an effective alternative to routine incisional surgery for paediatric disease. We aimed to investigate the temporal patterns of practice , indications and outcomes of chemodenervation for paediatric strabismus at national and tertiary centre level. Retrospective study using routinely collected patient data: Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES) data were used to identify children undergoing non-incisional strabismus procedures in England from 2007 to 2016. Single-centre retrospective data on children undergoing botulinum<pathogen> toxin injections ( Dysport Â® 2.5 units/ 0.1 ml) as an isolated intervention ( not involving incisional procedures) was undertaken to identify indications and outcomes. Successful outcome was defined as deviation < 11 prism dioptres ( PD). Between 2007 and 2016 , there was no increase in the proportion of childhood strabismus involving non-incisional procedures. Amongst 150 children undergoing chemodenervation for strabismus within the tertiary centre , the most common diagnoses were acute onset esotropia ( n = 34) , infantile esotropia ( n = 16) and consecutive exotropia ( n = 15). Median age at injection was 8.5 years ( range 0.9-15 years) , and median follow up 12 months ( 6 months-11 years). Success rates differed by diagnosis , from 66 % ( non or partially accommodative esotropia) to 0 % ( congenital cranial disorders). Adverse events were seen in 62/150 , 41 % , most commonly transient ptosis<symptom> ( 39 % , n = 58). Overcorrection was seen in 14/119 , 13 %. Mild subconjunctival haemorrhage ( n = 2) was the only other adverse event. Botulinum<pathogen> toxin for childhood strabismus has an acceptable safety profile , and considerable potential therapeutic benefit. However , nationally there has been no increased uptake of chemodenervation non-incisional procedures. Further prospective studies are necessary to understand the predictors of outcome within the separate clinical subgroups , to guide clinical decision making.
