  Single-stranded ( ss) oligonucleotide aptamers are emerging as the promising substitutes for monoclonal antibodies because of their low<symptom> production<symptom> cost and good batch-to-batch consistency. Aptamers vividly bind to a variety of cellular targets and alter their functions with a remarkable degree of specificities. In this study , the positive clones of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2) specific binding ssDNA<pathogen> aptamers which were previously identified by in vitro Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment ( SELEX) process , hitherto lacking the putative binding site information and residues crucial for aptamer recognition are studied. Primarily , four putative DNA binding regions present on the HER2 extracellular domain ( ECD) were identified using prediction servers and electrostatic potential maps , which were further exploited to delineate the aptamer binding features. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations revealed stable binding nature of three aptamers ( H2 > H1 > H6) , which chose Site 2a as preferred binding site present on the HER2 ( ECD) protein. Furthermore , amino acid residues viz.. Asn37 , Gln59 , Arg81-Gln84 , Asp88 , and Lys128 of Site 2a were found to be crucial for high-affinity binding. This knowledge can be utilized as a benchmark for the future studies , in search for better and highly specific anti-HER2 aptamers as cancer therapeutics or as diagnostic agents.
