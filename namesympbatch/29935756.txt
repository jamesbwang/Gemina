  The current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder ( MDD) do not allow prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response. A possible strategy to improve this situation is the identification of depression<symptom> subtypes on the bases of biomarkers reflecting underlying pathological processes such as neuro-inflammation. The PubMed/Medline database was searched until Apr 25th , 2017. In the initial search 1018 articles were retrieved , which were subsequently screened and only selected when the inclusion and exclusion criteria were fulfilled. Eight eligible studies were found. Overall , serum interleukin-6 and 1β values were increased in the melancholic MDD subtype compared to controls and the non-melancholic MDD subtype. C-reactive protein was increased in non-melancholic MDD in 2 out of 4 studies , while there was no difference for tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α and interleukin-2 and 10. Given the paucity of eligible studies the tentative conclusion must be drawn that peripheral inflammation<symptom> markers have limited added value thus far to distinguish between melancholic and non-melancholic depression<symptom> To allow for a more definitive conclusion , further research is warranted using a broader panel of inflammatory markers in MDD subtypes , preferably based on a general consensus regarding diagnostic criteria and subtype<pathogen> definitions.
