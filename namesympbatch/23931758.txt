  Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) which is associated with cellular dysfunction , disease etiology , and senescence. Here , we used the eukaryotic model Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , commonly studied for cellular aging , to demonstrate how defective mitochondrial function affects yeast replicative lifespan ( RLS). We show that RLS of respiratory-deficient cells decreases significantly , indicating that the maintenance of RLS requires active respiration<symptom>. The shortening of RLS due to mitochondrial dysfunction was not related to the accumulation of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles , a well-known cause of aging in yeast. Instead , intracellular ROS and oxidatively damaged proteins increased in respiratory-deficient mutants. We show that , while the protein kinase A activity is not elevated , ROS generation in respiratory-deficient cells depends on RAS signaling pathway. The ER-localized NADPH oxidase Yno1 also played a role in producing ROS. Our data suggest that a severe defect in mitochondrial respiration<symptom> accelerates cellular aging by disturbing protein homeostasis in yeast.
