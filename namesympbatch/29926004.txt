  We validated a navigator-echo-triggered sequence that drives magnetization before cardiac-gated inversion recovery T1 turbo<pathogen> field echo acquisition , in the sedated free-breathing pediatric population. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed on sedated infants with single ventricle. We calculated the signal-to-noise ratios and contrast-to-noise ratios of 2 groups of images obtained using respiratory triggering with and without navigator echo. All images were then visually assessed by 2 observers. The signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio were significantly higher with than without navigator echo ( p < 0.01; p < 0.05). The visual assessment scores were also consistently better with than without navigator echo ( p < 0.01). Free-breathing navigator echo was found to have the advantage of decreasing the motion artifact caused by respiration<symptom>. Cardiacgated inversion recovery T1 turbo<pathogen> field echo sequence for free-breathing navigator-echo-triggered respiration<symptom> allows for the acquisition , in sedated infants , of diagnostic images whose quality exceeds that of the non-navigator-echo-triggered alternative.
