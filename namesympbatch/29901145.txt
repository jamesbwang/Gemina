  Acute myocardial infarction induces ventricular remodeling , which is implicated in dilated<symptom> heart and heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The pathogenical mechanism of myocardium remodeling remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to identify key genes and networks for myocardium remodeling following ischemia‑reperfusion ( IR). First , the mRNA expression data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database were downloaded to identify differences in mRNA expression of the IR heart at days 2 and 7. Then , weighted gene co‑expression network analysis , hierarchical clustering , protein‑protein interaction ( PPI) network , Gene Ontology ( GO) , Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) pathway were used to identify key genes and networks for the heart remodeling process following IR. A total of 3,321 differentially expressed genes were identified during the heart remodeling process. A total of 6 modules were identified through gene co‑expression network analysis. GO and KEGG analysis results suggested that each module represented a different biological function and was associated with different pathways. Finally , hub genes of each module were identified by PPI network construction. The present study revealed that heart remodeling following IR is a complicated process , involving extracellular matrix organization , neural development , apoptosis and energy metabolism. The dysregulated genes , including SRC proto‑oncogene , non‑receptor tyrosine kinase , discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 1 , ATP citrate lyase , RAN , member RAS oncogene family , tumor protein p53 , and polo like kinase 2 , may be essential for heart remodeling following IR and may be used as potential targets for the inhibition of heart remodeling following acute myocardial infarction.
