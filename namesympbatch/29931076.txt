  Immunotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic ( R/M) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( SCCHN) is promising. The toll-like receptor 8 ( TLR8) agonist motolimod may stimulate innate and adaptive immunity. To determine whether motolimod improves outcomes for R/M SCCHN when combined with standard therapy. The Active8 study was a multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolling adult patients ( age â‰¥ 18 years) with histologically confirmed R/M SCCHN of the oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , or larynx between October 2013 and August 2015. Follow-up ended September 2016. Analysis for the present report was conducted between June 2016 and December 2017. Combination treatment with platinum ( carboplatin or cisplatin) , fluorouracil , cetuximab ( the EXTREME regimen) , and either placebo or motolimod , each administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Patients received a maximum of 6 chemotherapy cycles , after which patients received weekly cetuximab with either placebo or motolimod every 4 weeks. Progression-free survival ( PFS) as determined by independent central review using immune-related RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Key secondary end points included overall survival ( OS) and safety. Of 195 patients enrolled , 85 % were men ( n = 166); 82 % were white ( n = 159); median age was 58 years ( range 23-81 years). Median PFS was 6.1 vs 5.9 months ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 0.99; 1-sided 90 % CI , 0.00-1.22; P = .47) , and median OS was 13.5 vs 11.3 months ( HR , 0.95; 1-sided 90 % CI , 0.00-1.22; P = .40) for motolimod vs placebo. Increased incidence of injection site reactions , pyrexia , chills<symptom> , anemia<symptom> , and acneiform rash<symptom> were noted with motolimod. Of 83 cases oropharyngeal cancer , 52 ( 63 %) were human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) positive. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of HPV-positive participants , motolimod vs placebo resulted in significantly longer PFS ( 7.8 vs 5.9 months; HR , 0.58; 1-sided 90 % CI , 0.00-0.90; P = .046) and OS ( 15.2 vs 12.6 months; HR , 0.41; 1-sided 90 % CI , 0.00-0.77; P = .03). In an exploratory analysis , patients with injection site reactions had longer PFS and OS ( median PFS , 7.1 vs 5.9 months; HR , 0.69; 1-sided 90 % CI , 0.00-0.93; P = .06; and median OS , 18.7 vs 12.6; HR , 0.56; 1-sided 90 % CI , 0.00-0.81; P = .02). Adding motolimod to the EXTREME regimen was well tolerated but did not improve PFS or OS in the intent-to-treat population. Significant benefit was observed in HPV-positive patients and those with injection site reactions , suggesting that TLR8 stimulation may benefit subset- and biomarker-selected patients.
