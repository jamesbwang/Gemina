  Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> causes nosocomial infections of burn patients and other immunocompromised individuals , but the conventional diagnosis of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> infection depends on time-consuming culture-based methods. Hence , a simple , fast , sensitive technique for detection of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> using multiple cross displacement amplification ( MCDA) and gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensors ( LFB) was developed. By using this technique , the reaction could be completed at an optimized constant temperature ( 67 Â°C) within only 40 min. The reaction product could be detected visually using an LFB , eliminating the need for special equipment. The P. aeruginosa-MCDA-LFB method was highly specific , and accurately distinguished P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> from other pathogens. Just 10 fg of genomic DNA template ( from pure culture) could be detected. The assay could also detect P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> in clinical sputum<symptom> samples and showed the same sensitivity and specificity as the reference ( culture-biochemical) method. In the future , this rapid , simple and accurate P. aeruginosa-MCDA-LFB technique might be applied in clinical practice.
