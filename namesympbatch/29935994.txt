  Mutations in TCAP gene cause autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G ( LGMD2G) , congenital muscular dystrophy and autosomal dominant dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We studied 18 affected individuals from 12 pedigrees , belonging to a Bulgarian Muslim minority from the South-West of Bulgaria , homozygous for the c. 75G > A , p.Trp25X mutation in TCAP gene. The heterozygous carrier rate of p.Trp25X among 100 newborns in this region was found to be 2 %. The clinical features in the Bulgarian TCAP group include disease onset in the first to the third decade of life , proximal<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> in the lower limbs , followed or accompanied by difficulties in ankle dorsiflexion and involvement of the proximal muscles of the upper limbs 5-9 years after the disease onset. Asymmetry between left and right was present in more than 20 % of the affected. Respiratory and cardiac functions were not affected. On the MRI the muscles of the posterior pelvic area , thigh and anterior leg were predominantly affected , while sartorius , gracilis<pathogen> and biceps femoris muscles remained relatively spared. In conclusion , LGMD2G appears to be a common form among Bulgarian Muslims. Homozygosity for c. 75G > A , p.Trp25X is associated with a homogeneous clinical presentation , but the clinical course and severity of the disease show inter- and intra-familial variation.
