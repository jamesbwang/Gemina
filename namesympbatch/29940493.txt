  We evaluated the compensatory adaptations in muscle regionalization and synergist activity after fatiguing a biarticular muscle at one joint with different muscle lengths. Eleven men ( mean ± SD age = 23 ± 3 years) performed 50 maximal concentric isokinetic contractions of the dominant hip flexors<symptom> on two occasions. For one trial , the knee joint was fully extended. For the other , the knee joint was fixed at 70 °. Maximal voluntary contractions of the knee extensors were performed immediately before and after the hip flexion fatigue<symptom> protocol while bipolar surface electromyographic signals were detected from the vastus lateralis and at five points along the length of the rectus<pathogen> femoris. Regardless of knee joint angle during the hip flexion fatigue<symptom> protocol , knee extension peak torque was unchanged following hip flexion fatigue<symptom>. Electromyographic amplitude for the vastus lateralis ( p = .047 , η
