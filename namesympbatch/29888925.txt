  Lactobacilli show anti-inflammatory effects in the human intestine , and their genomic DNA was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. Increased levels of the natural protease inhibitor elafin in the intestine plays an important role in protection against intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. However , there have been no previous reports regarding whether lactobacilli increase elafin levels. This study was performed to investigate whether Lactobacillus<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> induces elafin secretion from the human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line , Caco-2. Moreover , we examined the roles of bacterial genomic DNA and toll-like receptor 9 ( TLR9) , a specific receptor of bacterial DNA , in this effect. Elafin secretion from Caco-2 cells by live and heat-killed L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> was measured. The analysis was also performed using DNase-treated L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> and genomic DNA extracted from L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen>. We examined the role of TLR9 in elafin secretion by L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> and its genomic DNA by suppressing TLR9 expression using RNAi in Caco-2 cells. Heat-killed L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> time- and dose-dependently increased elafin secretion , whereas live L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> had no such effect. The elafin secretion by heat-killed L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> was partially abolished by DNase treatment of the bacterium<pathogen>. In addition , L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> genomic DNA also increased elafin secretion. Furthermore , suppression of TLR9 expression partially or completely abolished elafin secretion by heat-killed L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> and its genomic DNA. Our results indicated that heat-killed L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> induced genomic DNA-dependent and TLR9-mediated elafin secretion. The anti-inflammatory effects of lactobacilli may be mediated by increases in the levels of elafin in the intestine.
