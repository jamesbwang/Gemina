  Cognitive impairment and malnutrition are two important public health issues in the elderly , which have been associated with their mental health. This study aims to evaluate the nutritional status of an elderly population in Greece , and its association with the grade of cognitive decline , anthropometric measures and psychological status. A total of 2092 elderly men and women were enrolled from seven Greek cities. Mini<pathogen> Nutritional Assessment ( MNA) , Mini<pathogen> Mental<symptom> State Examination ( MMSE) and Geriatric Depression<symptom> Scale ( GDS) questionnaires were used to assess the impact of nutritional status on cognitive abilities and psychological status of the participants. Of the elderly , 35.0 % were at risk of malnutrition and 11.3 % were malnourished , while 34.4 % of the participants had impaired cognitive function , and 32.3 % showed depressive symptoms. Malnutrition was more frequently observed in participants presenting cognitive impairment , and depressive symptoms. In multiple regression analysis , nutritional status was independently associated with cognitive and psychological status. A high prevalence of malnutrition was recorded in this elderly population sample , which was directly associated with cognitive impairment and depression<symptom> Diagnostic tools such as MNA , MMSE , and GDS are strongly recommended to be applied as a routine clinical practice in the elderly to timely and effectively address these health problems.
