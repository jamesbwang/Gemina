  Probiotics have generated intensive research interest in recent years as a novel mode of treatment for physical and mental illness. Nevertheless , the anxiolytic potential of probiotics remains unclear. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical and preclinical ( animal model) evidence regarding the effect of probiotic administration on anxiety<symptom>. The PubMed , PsycINFO , and Web of Science databases were reviewed for preclinical and clinical studies that met the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The effects of probiotics on anxiety-like behavior and symptoms of anxiety<symptom> were analyzed by meta-analyses. Separate subgroup analyses were conducted on diseased versus healthy animals , specific preclinical probiotic species , and clinical versus healthy human samples. Data were extracted from 22 preclinical studies ( 743 animals) and 14 clinical studies ( 1527 individuals). Overall , probiotics reduced anxiety-like behavior in animals ( Hedges ' g = -0.47 , 95 % CI -0.77-- 0.16 , p = 0.004). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant reduction only among diseased animals. Probiotic species-level analyses identified only Lactobacillus<pathogen> ( L.) rhamnosus<pathogen> as an anxiolytic species , but these analyses were broadly under-powered. Probiotics did not significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety<symptom> in humans ( Hedges ' g = -0.12 , 95 % CI -0.29-0.05 , p = 0.151) , and did not differentially affect clinical and healthy human samples. While preclinical ( animal) studies suggest that probiotics may help reduce anxiety<symptom> , such findings have not yet translated to clinical research in humans , perhaps due to the dearth of extant research with clinically anxious populations. Further investigation of probiotic treatment for clinically relevant anxiety<symptom> is warranted , particularly with respect to the probiotic species
