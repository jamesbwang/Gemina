  Research of dopaminergic deficits has focused on the ventral striatum<pathogen> ( VS) with many studies elucidating altered resting state functional connectivity ( rsFC) in individuals with cocaine dependence ( CD). The VS comprises functional subregions and delineation of subregional changes in rsFC requires careful consideration of the differences between addicted and healthy populations. In the current study , we parcellated the VS using whole-brain rsFC differences between CD and non-drug-using controls ( HC). Voxels with similar rsFC changes formed functional clusters. The results showed that the VS was divided into 3 subclusters , in the area of the dorsal-anterior VS ( daVS) , dorsal posterior VS ( dpVS) , and ventral VS ( vVS) , each in association with different patterns of rsFC. The three subregions shared reduced rsFC with bilateral hippocampal/parahippocampal gyri ( HG/PHG) but also showed distinct changes , including reduced vVS rsFC with ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC) and increased daVS rsFC with visual cortex in CD as compared to HC. Across CD , daVS visual cortical connectivity was positively correlated with amount of prior-month cocaine use and cocaine craving , and vVS vmPFC connectivity was negatively correlated with the extent of depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom>. These findings suggest a distinct pattern of altered VS subregional rsFC in cocaine dependence , and some of the changes have eluded analyses using the whole VS as a seed region. The findings may provide new insight to delineating VS circuit deficits in cocaine dependence and provide an alternative analytical framework to address functional dysconnectivity in other mental illnesses.
