  The 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein ( GRP94) belonging to the HSP90 family is an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) chaperone. It plays critical roles in ER quality control , and has been implicated as a specialized immune chaperone to regulate both innate and adaptive immunity. In this study , we identified and characterized a GRP94 gene ( PyGRP94) from Yesso scallop ( Patinopecten yessoensis). The protein sequence of PyGRP94 is highly conserved with its homologs in vertebrates , with a signal sequence in N-terminal , an ER retrieval signal sequence in C-terminal and a HATPase_c domain. Expression analysis suggests that PyGRP94 transcripts in early embryos are maternally derived and the zygotic expression is started from D-shaped larvae. This gene is also expressed in almost all the adult tissues examined except smooth muscle , with the highest expression level in hemocytes. Besides , PyGRP94 was demonstrated to be induced by heat shock<symptom> and both Gram-positive ( Micrococcus<pathogen> luteus<pathogen> and Gram-negative ( Vibrio anguillarum) bacterial infection , with much more dramatic changes being observed after V. anguillarum challenge. Our results suggest the involvement of PyGRP94 in response to thermal stress , and that it might play an important role in the innate immune defense of scallop.
