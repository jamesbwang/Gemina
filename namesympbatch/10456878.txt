  Posner-Schlossman-Syndrome ( PSS) is clinically characterized by acute , recurrent , mild , unilateral uveitis anterior accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP). Fuchs ' Uveitis ( FU) is a chronic , low-grade-inflammatory disorder , involving anterior uvea and vitreous. The clinical findings show remarkable similarities as well as differences. In our study , we determine the composition of immune mediators in aqueous humor of patients with PSS and FU and evaluate if immune mediators play a crucial role in specific viral intraocular inflammation<symptom> and IOP rises. Aqueous humor samples from 81 uveitis patients ( = eyes) presenting with either PSS or FU were collected at one time point. Local intraocular antibody synthesis to rubella<pathogen> virus<pathogen> was confirmed in 65 patients , whereas 16 were tested positively for human cytomegalovirus. Thirteen patients with PSS and 10 patients with FU were treated with glaucoma medications. Additionally , 11 cataract patients acted as control group. Immune mediator concentrations were measured by Bio-Plex Pro assay. We observed in both PSS ( IFN-γ: 174.9 pg/mL; TNF-α: 25.1 pg/mL) and FU ( IFN-γ: 25.4 pg/mL; TNF-α: 27.2 pg/mL) groups a significantly increased level of T-helper 1 immune mediators compared to controls ( IFN-γ , TNF-α: 0 pg/mL) ( median). Notably , PSS patients ( IL-1RA: 73.4 pg/mL; IL-8: 199.4 pg/mL; IL-10: 33.4 pg/mL; IP-10: 126350 pg/mL) showed a stronger and more active ocular inflammatory response , than FU patients ( IL-1RA: 4.3 pg/mL; IL-8: 72.4 pg/mL; IL-10: 1.6 pg/mL; IP-10: 57400 pg/mL). Furthermore , a negative correlation between mediators and IOP was seen in the PSS group , potentially caused by acetazolamide-treatment. Our findings show that immune mediators play a crucial role in specific viral intraocular inflammation<symptom> and influence IOP levels. Remarkable similarities but also significant differences of immune mediator concentrations are apparent in PSS compared to FU. High concentrations of IL-1RA , IL-8 , IL-10 , and IP-10 correlate with active inflammation<symptom> in PSS , while FU may trigger chronic inflammation<symptom>. Our data also substantiated a very similar composition of cytokines in those patients from the PSS group suffering from ocular hypertension and thus offers a potential explanation model for a negative correlation between mediators and IOP.
