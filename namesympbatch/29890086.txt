  New isolation of Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> ( Pa) is generally treated with inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics such as tobramycin inhalation solution ( TIS). A therapeutic approach complementing traditional antimicrobial therapy by reducing the risk of pulmonary exacerbation ( PEx) and inflammation<symptom> may ultimately prolong time to Pa recurrence. To test the hypothesis that the addition of azithromycin to TIS in children with CF and early Pa decreases the risk of PEx and prolongs time to Pa recurrence. The OPTIMIZE trial was a multicenter , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , 18-month trial in children with CF ages 6 months-18 years with early Pa.. Azithromycin or placebo was given 3x weekly with standardized TIS. The primary endpoint was time to PEx requiring antibiotics and secondary endpoint time to Pa recurrence , in addition to other clinical and safety outcomes. 221 participants ( 111 placebo , 110 azithromycin) out of a planned 274 were enrolled. Enrollment was stopped early by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute ( NHLBI) because the trial had reached the pre-specified interim boundary for efficacy. The risk of PEx was reduced by 44 % in the azithromycin group as compared to placebo ( hazard ratio ( HR): 0.56 , 95 % CI: 0.37,0.83 , p = 0.004). Weight increased by 1.27 kg in the azithromycin group compared to placebo ( 95 % CI: 0.01,2.52 , p = 0.046). No significant differences were seen in microbiologic , clinical , or safety endpoints. Azithromycin was associated with a significant reduction in risk of PEx and sustained improvement in weight but had no impact on microbiologic outcomes in children with early Pa.. Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02054156).
