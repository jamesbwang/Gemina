  Excessive checking is a common , debilitating symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder. To further examine cognitive processes underpinning checking behaviour , and clarify how and why checking develops , we designed a novel operant paradigm for rats , the observing response task. The present study used the observing response task to investigate checking behaviour following excitotoxic lesions<symptom> of the medial prefrontal cortex , nucleus accumbens core and dorsal striatum<pathogen> , brain regions considered to be of relevance to obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the observing response task , rats pressed an ` observing ' lever for information ( provided by light onset) about the location of an ` active ' lever that provided food reinforcement. Following training , rats received excitotoxic lesions<symptom> of the regions described above and performance was evaluated post-operatively before histological processing. Medial prefrontal cortex lesions<symptom> selectively increased functional checking with a less-prominent effect on non-functional checking and reduced discrimination accuracy during light information periods. Rats with nucleus accumbens core lesions<symptom> made significantly more checking responses than sham-lesioned rats , including both functional and non-functional checking. Dorsal striatum<pathogen> lesions<symptom> had no direct effect on checking per se , but reduced both active and inactive lever presses , and therefore changed the relative balance<symptom> between checking responses and instrumental responses. These results suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens core are important in the control of checking , perhaps via their role in processing uncertainty of reinforcement , and that dysfunction of these regions may therefore promote excessive checking behaviour , possibly relevant to obsessive-compulsive disorder.
