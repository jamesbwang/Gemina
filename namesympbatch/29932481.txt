  Obesity is highly prevalent in pet cats ( Felis<pathogen> silvestris catus) and is associated with several comorbidities , yet very little is understood about the early life risk factors. The aim of this study was to develop a mathematical model that describes growth in cats , to determine which early life variables were associated with being overweight in adulthood and to identify when during life the overweight phenotype developed in a colony of cats. We used pedigree , birth and growth data of 212 colony cats that were fed ad libitum from weaning. A nonlinear mixed-effects model was fitted to the body<symptom> weight data to describe growth curves. A subset of 146 cats that had reached 9 years of age was used to evaluate the body<symptom> weight curves to 9 years , and candidate early life predictors of peak weight were evaluated using logistic regression. In contrast with other species , candidates such as maternal factors , birth weight and litter size were not significant risk factors for adult obesity. Male sex , body<symptom> weight around 15 weeks of age and being born during the increasing photoperiod were significantly associated with being overweight at 9 years. The growth equation created can be used to predict peak body<symptom> weight , when sex and season of birth are included. Thus , the trajectory to obesity is determined early in life in cats , and early intervention appears essential to prevent obesity in pet cats.
