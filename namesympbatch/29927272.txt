  Among men who have sex with men ( MSM) , HIV<pathogen> sexual risk and poor self-care behavior is associated with syndemics , or co-occurring psychosocial problems. Though prior research has demonstrated an additive total effect of syndemics on HIV<pathogen> risk behavior and infection , mostly within cross-sectional designs , it is possible that these associations are not direct but rather that syndemics disrupt relevant individual-level mediating psychological variables. One of the more common individual-level psychological variables that predicts health behavior generally , and HIV<pathogen> risk behavior specifically , is self-efficacy. This study sought to examine the potential effects of syndemics on condomless sex via condom-use self-efficacy as an intermediary variable. In high-risk MSM ( N = 197) , across 3 time points ( baseline , 3 months , and 6 months) we used latent growth curve modeling to test the degree to which self-efficacy mediated the relationship between syndemics ( heavy alcohol use , substance use disorder , sexual compulsivity , depression<symptom> , social anxiety<symptom> , intimate partner violence , childhood sexual abuse) and condomless anal sex. The baseline analyses were consistent with an indirect effect of the association between syndemics and condomless sex through self-efficacy. Prospective longitudinal mediation was partially supported , such that baseline syndemics were associated with lower baseline self-efficacy , which in turn predicted higher increases in condomless anal sex across time. These findings provide preliminary evidence ( due to the partial support for the longitudinal model) that syndemics themselves may not be directly causal in their association with condomless sex , but the association may be through modifiable social-cognitive mechanisms such as condom self-efficacy.
