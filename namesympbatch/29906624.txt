  Red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis<symptom> virus ( RGNNV) is one of the most important viruses which mainly infects the larva of marine and freshwater fish with high mortality and affects the fishery industry worldwide. Currently , there are no effective vaccines available for the fish larva infected with NNV. Immunoglobulin yolk ( IgY) origin of oviparous animals is passed from the blood serum and concentrated in the egg yolk. With the advantages of high yield , cost-effectiveness , and high stability , IgY can be widely used in passive immunization , especially in young animals in which adaptive immunity is not fully developed. In this study , we have cloned and expressed the recombinant capsid protein of RGNNV in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and used as an immunogen for generating specific anti-RGNNV IgY antibody in laying hens. Water-soluble fractions ( WSF) of the specific IgY were isolated from egg yolk and purified by two-step precipitation with saturated ammonium sulfate salting. By Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , the titer of the IgY reached a peak at the 6th week post of immunization and had a strong stability at a wide range of temperature , pH , and pepsin enzyme digestion. The purified IgY was competent to neutralize and completely inhibited the RGNNV replication in the grouper fin cell line ( GF-1) , indicating that it was highly specific and effectively recognized RGNNV. The results will pave a new way for the prevention of RGNNV infection.
