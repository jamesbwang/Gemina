  To investigate the ability of E faecalis to cause apoptosis and pyroptosis of human osteoblastic MG63 cells and whether the inflammasome is involved in this process. MG63 cells were infected with E faecalis at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI) of 10 , 100 , 500 and 1000 for 6 and 12 h. The cell proliferation was determined with the Cell Counting Kit-8. Apoptosis and pyroptosis after E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> infection was evaluated by flow cytometry and a lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) cytotoxicity assay kit. Then , MG63 cells transfected with specific small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs) targeting the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 ( NLRP3) gene were infected with E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> and subjected to the LDH release and apoptotic cell assays. One-way anova test and Student-Newman-Keuls test were used to evaluate the differences amongst groups in each experiment. An independent sample t-test was performed to analyse the differences between the 12- and 6-h time-points. P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> induced apoptosis and inflammatory cell death ( pyroptosis) of MG63 cells in a MOI dose-dependent manner. The NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 were activated in E. faecalis-infected MG63 cells. However , the percentages of induced apoptotic and pyroptic cell death decreased significantly when the NLRP3 inflammasome was downregulated using siRNAs ( P < 0.05). E faecalis promoted apoptosis and pyroptosis of MG63 cells via the NLRP3 inflammasome. This indicates that E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> infection may result in the delayed reconstruction of periapical lesions<symptom> , and NLRP3 is the potential target of new intracanal therapeutic agents.
