  The incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma , both absolute and relative to squamous cell carcinoma , is increasing. Most cervical adenocarcinomas are human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> associated , although non-human papillomavirus-associated neoplasms exist; the latter include gastric-type adenocarcinoma ( GAS) and clear cell carcinoma ( CCC). Histologically , these 2 tumors may superficially resemble one other and although morphologic evaluation usually permits a correct diagnosis , immunohistochemistry may be required to resolve diagnostic uncertainty , especially in a small biopsy specimen. Markers of CCC include hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta ( HNF1β) and Napsin A. In order to explore the utility of these markers in distinguishing between GAS and CCC , we stained 24 cases of GAS ( 19 cervical , 5 vaginal) , 3 of cervical gastric-type adenocarcinoma in situ ( gAIS) and 14 CCCs ( 13 cervical , 1 vaginal) with these antibodies. We found HNF1β expression in 21 of 23 cases of GAS ( 91.3 %; there was no material available for staining in 1 case) , 3/3 cases of gAIS ( 100 %) and 10 of 14 ( 71.4 %) CCCs. Napsin A was expressed in 4 of 24 ( 16.7 %) cases of GAS , 0 of 3 ( 0 %) gAIS , and 11 of 14 ( 78.6 %) CCC. On the basis of these findings , Napsin A is of value in resolving diagnostic confusion<symptom> between GAS and CCC , whereas HNF1β lacks specificity and its use in this setting is discouraged.
