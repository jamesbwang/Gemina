  Over the last few decades , public life has taken center stage in urban studies , but that is about to change. At times , indoor activities have been shown to matter more than what is publicly visible ( they have been found to be more predictive of future crimes , for example). Until recently , however , data has not been available to study indoor activities at city scale. To that end , we propose a new methodology that relies on tagging information of geo-referenced pictures and unfolds in three main steps. First , we collected and classified a comprehensive set of activity-related words , creating the first dictionary of urban activities. Second , for both London and New<pathogen> York City , we collected geo-referenced Flickr tags and matched them with the words in the dictionary. This step produced both a systematic classification ( our activity-related words were best classified in eleven categories) and two city-wide indoor activity maps which , when compared to open data of public amenities and sensory maps of smell and sound<symptom> matched theoretical expectations. Third , we studied , for the first time , activities happening indoor in relation to neighborhood socio-economic conditions. We found the very same result for both London and New<pathogen> York City. In deprived areas , people focused on any of the activity types ( leading to specialization) , and it did not matter on which one they did so. By contrast , in well-to-do areas , people engaged not in one type of activity but in a variety of them ( leading to diversification).
