  Primary dystonia is a neurological disease with the characteristics of abnormal , involuntary twisting and turning movements , which greatly affects life quality of patients. Treatments for dystonia consist of oral medications , botulinum<pathogen> neurotoxin injections , physical therapy and surgeries. For medication-refractory dystonia , surgeries , especially deep brain stimulation ( DBS) , are the optimal option. the patient was a 13-year-old boy suffering from extremely severe primary dystonia , with a BFMDRS-M score of 118 and a TWSTRS-S score of 29. The examination of 173 genes including DYT failed to identify any abnormality. He responded ineffectively to medications. After both bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS and unilateral Vim-Vo thalamotomy ( combined thalamic lesion<symptom> in ventralis intermedius<pathogen> nucleus and ventralis oralis<pathogen> nucleus) , his movement disorder improved dramatically. Four months and seven months after the operation , the scores of two rating scales sharply decreased. And potential brain structural changes were reflected in sensorimotor-related cortical thickness , surface area and gray matter volume from MRI , which revealed a valid method to evaluate surgical effect on the brain with enough patients. DBS and thalamotomy is potentially an effective combination of treatments for severe medication-refractory dystonia.
