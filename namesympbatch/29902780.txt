  Intrauterine transfusion ( IUT) has changed fetal anemia<symptom> prognosis. However , long-term neurodevelopmental outcome is altered in 5 % of children. Our objective was to study the contribution of fetal MRI to diagnosis brain lesions<symptom> in case of fetal anemia<symptom> Retrospective monocentric descriptive study from 2005 to 2016 , including all patients followed for fetal anemia<symptom> requiring IUT. The indications for MRI were: hydrops fetalis<pathogen> and/ or hemoglobin < 5 g/ dL and/ or more than 3 IUTs and/ or acute severe anemia<symptom> and/ or ultrasound abnormality. Fetal and neonatal outcome and pediatric neurological monitoring were studied. 89 patients were followed for fetal anemia<symptom> with IUT and 28 ( 29.1 %) had fetal MRI , 12 of which were abnormal. Two out of twelve had abnormal ultrasound. Seven out of twelve had poor neurological prognosis: 2 medical terminations of pregnancy were performed; 2 children had severe developmental delay and 3 children had schooling difficulties. Five out of twelve children had favorable neurological prognosis. MRI of the fetal brain makes it possible to better detect brain lesions<symptom> than ultrasound does in the management of severe fetal anemia<symptom> and seems particularly appropriate in cases of
