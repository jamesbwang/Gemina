  To compare the performance of self-collected vaginal ( V) specimens with clinician-collected cervical ( C) specimens for detection of high-risk human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( hrHPV) and cervical disease using the Cepheid Xpert HPV<pathogen> , Roche Cobas 4800 HPV<pathogen> , and Hologic Aptima HPV<pathogen> assays. Women aged 30-59 years ( N = 1005) were recruited at two clinics in Papua New Guinea , and provided specimens for testing at point-of-care using the Xpert HPV<pathogen> Test , and for subsequent testing using the Cobas HPV<pathogen> ( n = 981) and Aptima HPV<pathogen> ( n = 983) assays. Liquid-based cytology was performed on C specimens to predict underlying high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions<symptom> ( HSIL). V specimen results of each assay were evaluated against a constructed gold standard and for detection of HSIL or worse. There was substantial ( Kappa > 0.6) agreement in hrHPV detection between V and C specimens across all three assays. The sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive value of Xpert HPV<pathogen> using self-collected V specimens for the detection of HPV16 according to the constructed gold standard was 92.1 % , 93.1 % , 63.6 % and 98.9 % respectively; compared to 90.4 % , 94.3 % , 67.8 % and 98.7 % for Cobas 4800 HPV<pathogen>; and 63.2 % , 97.2 % , 75.0 % and 95.3 % for Aptima HPV<pathogen>. Similar results were observed for all hrHPV types ( combined) and for HPV<pathogen> 18/45 , on all three assays. The detection of any hrHPV using self-collected specimens had high sensitivity ( 86-92 %) , specificity ( 87-94 %) and NPV ( > 98 %) on all assays for HSIL +. Xpert HPV<pathogen> , using self-collected vaginal specimens , has sufficient accuracy for use in point-of-care ` test and treat ' cervical screening strategies in high-burden , low-resource settings.
