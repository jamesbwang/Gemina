  We earlier found that F6 fraction of human filaria Brugia malayi cross-reacted with sera of Leishmania<pathogen> donovani infected hamsters and immunization with F6 inhibited both filarial and leishmanial infections. In the present study , we identified a 52.9-93.6 kDa fraction ( Ld1) of L. donovani that cross-reacted with sera of B. malayi infected animals and investigated effect of Ld1 on filarial infection. Immunization of BALB/c mice with Ld1 facilitated B. malayi infection with remarkable increase in parasite burden. Facilitation of filarial infection was associated with downregulated cell proliferation , IL-5 , IL-13 , IFN-γ , TNF-α , and IL-2 levels and upregulated IL-4 and TGF-β. Ld1 exposure also suppressed MHC class-I , MHC class-II , and FcεR1 expression , and phagocytosis in naive mouse macrophages , and CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD19 + cell population in mouse spleen. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry revealed eight proteins in Ld1: putative heat shock<symptom> protein ( HSP) 70-related protein 1 , HSP70 mitochondrial precursor , alanine aminotransferase , 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase , protein disulfide isomerase , putative ATPase beta subunit , trypanothione reductase , and a hypothetical protein. HSP70 protein mitochondrial precursor and trypanothione reductase showed homology with Trypanosoma cruzi and L. donovani , respectively , and the rest 6 proteins including hypothetical protein bear<pathogen> homology with L. infantum. In conclusion , the present study for the first time shows that immunization with filarial cross-reactive Ld1 fraction of L. donovani facilitates filarial infection by modulating Th1 and Th2 responses. Ld1 molecules may therefore facilitate filarial infection in filaria-leishmania co-infection.
