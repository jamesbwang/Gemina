  Given the comparable strains of high-risk human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) present in a subset of Barrett 's dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma as in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and the anatomical proximity of both lesions<symptom> , we hypothesized that oral sex may increase the risk of Barrett 's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma. Therefore , we compared the sexual behavior of patients with Barrett 's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma and controls ( hospital , reflux , and Barrett 's metaplasia) to explore a plausible mechanism of viral transmission to the lower esophagus. A hospital-based case-control study involving 36 Barrett 's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma subjects and 55 controls with known HPV<pathogen> DNA status and markers of transcriptional activity i.e p16INK4A and E6/E7 mRNA of the esophageal epithelium was conducted to evaluate differences in sexual history ( if any). Barrett 's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma patients were more likely than controls to be positive for HPV<pathogen> DNA ( 18 of 36 , 50 % vs. 6/55 , 11 % , p for trend < 0.0001) , be male ( P = 0.001) and in a relationship ( P = 0.02). Viral genotypes identified were HPV<pathogen> 16 ( n = 14) , 18 ( n = 2) , 11 ( n = 1) and 6 ( n = 1). HPV<pathogen> exposure conferred a significantly higher risk for Barrett 's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma as compared with hospital/reflux/Barrett 's metaplasia controls ( OR = 6.8 , 95 % CI: 2.1-23.1 , adjusted P = 0.002). On univariate analysis , ≥ 6 lifetime oral sex partners were significantly associated with dysplastic Barrett 's esophagus and adenocarcinoma ( OR , 4.0; 95 % CI: 1.2-13.7 , P = 0.046). After adjustment for confounders , HPV<pathogen> exposure and men with ≥ 2 lifetime sexual partners were at significant risk for Barrett 's dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma. If these initial findings can be confirmed in larger studies , it could lead to effective prevention strategies in combating some of the exponential increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the
