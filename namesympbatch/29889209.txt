  Cisterna magna<pathogen> cannulation ( CMc) is a straightforward procedure that enables direct access to the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) without operative damage to the skull or the brain parenchyma. In anesthetized rodents , the exposure of the dura mater by blunt dissection of the neck<symptom> muscles allows the insertion of a cannula into the cisterna magna<pathogen> ( CM). The cannula , composed either by a fine beveled needle or borosilicate capillary , is attached via a polyethylene ( PE) tube to a syringe. Using a syringe pump , molecules can then be injected at controlled rates directly into the CM , which is continuous with the subarachnoid space. From the subarachnoid space , we can trace CSF fluxes by convective flow into the perivascular space around penetrating arterioles , where solute exchange with the interstitial fluid ( ISF) occurs. CMc can be performed for acute<symptom> injections<symptom> immediately following the surgery , or for chronic implantation , with later injection in anesthetized or awake , freely moving rodents. Quantitation of tracer distribution in the brain parenchyma can be performed by epifluorescence , 2-photon microscopy , and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , depending on the physico-chemical properties of the injected molecules. Thus , CMc in conjunction with various imaging techniques offers a powerful tool for assessment of the glymphatic system and CSF dynamics and function. Furthermore , CMc can be utilized as a conduit for fast , brain-wide delivery of signaling molecules and metabolic substrates that could not otherwise cross the blood brain barrier ( BBB).
