  Vulvovaginal candidiasis is an inflammation<symptom> localized in the vulvovaginal area. It is mostly caused by Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> Its treatment is based on the systemic and/or local administration of antifungal drugs. However , this conventional therapy can fail owing to the resistance of the Candida<pathogen> species and noncompliance of patients. Amphotericin B-loaded PLGA nanofibers are single-use , antifungal , controlled drug delivery systems , and represent an alternative therapeutic scheme for the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Nanofibers were characterized by analytical techniques , and with an in vitro drug delivery study. In vitro and in vivo fungicidal activity of amphotericin B released from nanofibers was evaluated using the agar diffusion method and an experimental murine model of vulvovaginal candidiasis , respectively. Analytical techniques showed that amphotericin B was physically mixed in the polymeric nanofibers. Nanofibers controlled the delivery of therapeutic doses of amphotericin B for eight consecutive days , providing effective in vitro antifungal activity and eliminated the in vivo vaginal fungal burden after three days of treatment and with only one local application. Amphotericin B-loaded PLGA nanofibers could be potentially applied as an alternative strategy for the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis without inducing fungal resistance , yet ensuring patient compliance.
