  Cooperation is a prevalent phenomenon in nature and how it originates and maintains is a fundamental question in ecology. Many efforts have been made to understand cooperation between individuals in the same species , while the mechanisms enabling cooperation between different species are less understood. Here , we investigated under strict in vitro culture conditions if the exchange of carbon and phosphorus is pivotal to the cooperation between the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus ( AMF) Rhizophagus irregularis<pathogen> and the phosphate solubilizing bacterium<pathogen> ( PSB) Rahnella<pathogen> aquatilis<pathogen> We observed that fructose exuded by the AMF stimulated the expression of phosphatase genes in the bacterium<pathogen> as well as the rate of phosphatase release into the growth medium by regulating its protein secretory system. The phosphatase activity was subsequently increased , promoting the mineralization of organic phosphorus ( i.e. , phytate) into inorganic phosphorus , stimulating simultaneously the processes involved in phosphorus uptake by the AMF. Our results demonstrated for the first time that fructose not only is a carbon source , but also plays a role as a signal molecule triggering bacteria-mediated organic phosphorus mineralization processes. These results highlighted the molecular mechanisms by which the hyphal exudates<symptom> play a role in maintaining the cooperation between AMF and bacteria.
