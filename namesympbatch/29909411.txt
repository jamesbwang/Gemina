  Ever since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( ART) in 1995 , HIV<pathogen> infection has been linked to `` metabolic '' complications ( insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , osteoporosis , and others). Studies suggested increased rates of myocardial infarction , renal insufficiency , neurocognitive dysfunction , and fractures in HIV-postitive patients. Even long-term suppression of HIV<pathogen> seemed to be accompanied by an excess of deleterious inflammation<symptom> that could promote these complications. The aims of this viewpoint paper are to summarize recent data and to examine the possibility that the problem of aging-related morbidity in HIV<pathogen> might not be as dramatic as previously believed.
