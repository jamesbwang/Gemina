  Gel-like constructs can be produced using an extrusion-based 3D food printing ( 3D-FP) technique. Nostoc sphaeroides biomass is a natural gel material. Considering its good nutrition and rheological properties , these algae<pathogen> were chosen in this study as supply material ( ink) for 3D-FP. With this gel material , the extrusion-based 3D printing system was set as a model , and the printing behavior was investigated. Furthermore , the 3D-FP mechanisms were explained through low-field nuclear magnetic resonance and rheological measurements. Results indicated that although fresh biomass gel was printable , nonuniformity and instability occurred during printing. Blanched inks showed nonsmooth printing behavior , which was associated with a decrease in elasticity and viscosity. The printability was improved by increasing the rehydration time to 24 h when rehydrated powder was used. Increasing the rehydration time increased the water-binding degree. Pre-gelatinized potato starch was added to the mixture at ratios ranging from 1 to 100 g kg We emphasize that elasticity and viscosity balance<symptom> is an essential parameter to achieve printability. The strategies adopted in this work provide new insights into the development of personalized food regarding texture and nutritional additive content. This article is protected by copyright.
