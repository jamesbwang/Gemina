  Allelopathy is a phenomenon that involves the production of secondary metabolites that influence the growth of plants and microorganisms; however , this alellopathic effect has been scarcely studied on the rhizobia-legume symbiosis. The aims of this research were 1) to assess the allelopathic potential of aqueous extracts of Ipomoea purpurea L. Roth on seed germination and root length of common bean seedlings ( Phaseolus vulgaris<pathogen> L.) , 2) to determine its effects on the in vitro growth of Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 , and 3) to evaluate the allelopathic potential of I. purpurea on the growth , nodulation and physiology of common bean plants inoculated with R. tropici. After 48h , 15 % of the aqueous root extract of I. purpurea stimulated seed germination , whereas 4 % of the aqueous shoot extracts stimulated such germination. Both the root or shoot extracts stimulated seed germination and e root length. In vitro growth of R. tropici was inhibited as a result of the application of both aqueous extracts. The presence of I. purpurea negatively affected both the growth and physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> of common bean plants , and this effect was attenuated after the inoculation of R. tropici; nevertheless , this allelopathic plant affected root nodulation. Our results suggest that the symbiosis of rhizobia and roots of common bean plants is an important element for attenuating the negative effects caused by the allelopathic plant.
