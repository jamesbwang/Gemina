  Food insecurity , internalized HIV<pathogen> stigma , and depressive symptoms are independently associated with poor HIV<pathogen> outcomes. Food insecurity , stigma , and depression<symptom> may be interrelated among women living with HIV<pathogen> ( WLHIV). We hypothesized that food insecurity would be independently associated with internalized stigma and depressive symptoms among WLHIV in the United States ( US) , and would partially account for associations between stigma and depressive symptoms. We tested hypotheses using regression models and partial correlation analysis with cross-sectional data among 1317 WLHIV from the Women 's Interagency HIV<pathogen> Study. In adjusted models , greater food insecurity was associated with internalized HIV<pathogen> stigma and depressive symptoms ( all p < 0.05) , exhibiting dose-response relationships. Food insecurity accounted for 23.2 % of the total shared variance between depressive symptoms and internalized stigma. Food insecurity is associated with depressive symptoms and internalized HIV<pathogen> stigma among US WLHIV , and may play a role in the negative cycle of depression<symptom> and internalized stigma.
