  Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) improves symptoms of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) , morbidity and mortality in selected population. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR)- guided left ventricular ( LV) lead placement on clinical outcomes and LV reverse remodelling in CRT recipients. Patients with CRT indication were randomized for CMR-guided ( CMR group) or electrophysiologically guided ( EP group) LV lead placement between 2011 and 2014. The target site in the CMR group was defined as the most delayed , scar-free , in the EP group as the site with the longest interval between the QRS onset and local electrogram. The primary endpoint was a combination of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. Secondary endpoints were New<pathogen> York Heart Association ( NYHA) Class improvement ≥ 1 , LV endsystolic diameter reduction > 10 % , B-type natriuretic peptide reduction by ≥ 30 %. A total of 99 patients ( 47 in the CMR and 52 in the EP group) were enrolled. During a median follow-up of 47 months , primary composite endpoint occurred in 5 patients in the CMR group and 14 patients in the EP group ( HR = 0.46; 95 % CI: 0.16-1.32). Patients with left bundle branch block and NYHA Class > 2 had better clinical outcome in the CMR group ( HR = 0.09; 95 % CI: 0.01-0.75). The use of CMR did not result in significant reduction of combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization in the total study population. Significant clinical benefit from CMR-guided procedure was observed in a subgroup of optimum CRT candidates with advanced HF.
