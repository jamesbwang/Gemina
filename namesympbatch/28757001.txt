  Individuals with spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA) type 3 are able to walk but they have weakness<symptom> , gait impairments and fatigue<symptom>. Our primary study objective was to examine longitudinal changes in the six-minute walk test ( 6MWT) and to evaluate whether age and SMA type 3 subtype<pathogen> are associated with decline in ambulatory function. Data from three prospective natural history studies were used. Seventy-three participants who performed the 6MWT more than once , at least 6 months apart , were included; follow-up ranged from 0.5-9 years. Only data from patients who completed the 6MWT were included. The mean age of the participants was 13.5 years ( range 2.6-49.1) , with 52 having disease onset before age 3 years ( type 3A). At baseline , type 3A participants walked a shorter distance on average ( 257.1 m) than type 3B participants ( 390.2 m) ( difference = 133.1 m , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 71.8-194.3 , p < 0.001). Distance walked was weakly associated with age ( r = 0.25 , p = 0.04). Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate the mean annual rate of change. The overall mean rate of change was -7.8 m/year ( 95 % CI -13.6-- 2.0 , p = 0.009) and this did not differ by subtype<pathogen> ( type 3A: -8.5 m/year , type 3B: -6.6 m/year , p = 0.78) , but it did differ by age group ( < 6: 9.8 m/year; 6-10: -7.9 m/year; 11-19: -20.8 m/year; â‰¥ 20: -9.7 m/year; p = 0.005). Our results showed an overall decline on the 6MWT over time , but different trajectories were observed depending on age. Young ambulant SMA patients gain function but in adolescence , patients lose function. Future clinical trials in ambulant SMA patients should consider in their design the different trajectories of ambulatory function over time , based on age.
