  To assess whether CT morphology of adnexal lesions<symptom> in postmenopausal women with history of non-ovarian cancer could be used to discriminate benign and malignant lesions<symptom> , particularly focusing on applicability of the ACR criteria. This was an IRB-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective review of contrast-enhanced CTs of 199 women , 55 years and older. Lesions<symptom> were classified as simple cystic , complex cystic , solid-cystic , or solid based on CT morphology , and were diagnosed as benign , indeterminate , or malignant on follow-up imaging or pathology. Associated metastatic disease was noted , if present. Findings were analyzed to correlate CT morphology , primary tumor pathology , and metastatic disease pattern with eventual lesion<symptom> diagnosis. There were 223 adnexal lesions<symptom> , including 123 ( 55 %) simple cystic , 48 ( 22 %) complex<pathogen> cystic , 40 ( 18 %) solid-cystic , and 12 ( 5 %) solid lesions<symptom>. 186/223 ( 83 %) lesions<symptom> were benign , and 37/223 ( 17 %) were malignant. Primary colorectal cancer was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of malignant adnexal lesions<symptom> ( OR 10.2 , p < 0.001) compared to patients with other cancers. Adnexal malignancy was significantly associated with the presence of non-ovarian peritoneal metastases ( p < 0.001). None of the simple cysts<symptom> ( including 85 cysts<symptom> between 1-3 cm and 38 cysts<symptom> > 3 cm) were found to be malignant ( malignancy rate: 0.0 % , 95 % CI 0.0-3.0 %). Complex cysts<symptom> were more likely to be malignant than simple cysts<symptom> ( p = 0.002) and solid-cystic lesions<symptom> were more likely to be malignant than complex cysts<symptom> ( p < 0.001). Simple adnexal lesions<symptom> on CT in this cohort were unlikely to be malignant , supporting the ACR guidelines. A higher size threshold of 3 cm ( vs. 1 cm) may be preferred in all cases of simple cysts<symptom> for recommending further follow-up. However , more complex-appearing cysts<symptom> need further evaluation as the risk of malignancy is increased. Peritoneal metastases have a significant correlation with malignant adnexal involvement.
