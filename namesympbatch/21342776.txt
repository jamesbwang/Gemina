  The aim of this retrospective study was to compare early postoperative outcomes after aortic valve replacement ( AVR) with sutureless bioprostheses and conventional stented bioprostheses implanted through median sternotomy. From January 2011 to December 2016 , 763 patients underwent aortic valve replacement with bioprostheses; of these , 139 received a Perceval S sutureless valve ( Group A) and 624 received a Perimount Magna<pathogen> Ease valve ( Group B). These groups were further divided into A1 ( isolated Perceval AVR) , A2 ( Perceval AVR with coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG)) , B1 ( isolated conventional stented bioprosthesis) , and B2 ( conventional stented bioprosthesis + CABG). Patients in Group A were older ( mean 74 years vs. 71 years; P < 0.0001) , predominantly women ( 53 % vs. 32 %; P < 0.0001) , had a higher logistic EuroSCORE ( 3.26 vs. 2.43; P < 0.001) , more preoperative atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( 20 % vs. 13 %; P = 0.03) , and had a lower reopening rate for bleeding ( 2.1 % vs. 6.7 %; P = 0.04). Compared to Group B1 , Group A1 had shorter cross-clamp ( mean 40 min vs. 57 min; P â‰¤ 0.0001) and bypass times ( mean 63 min vs. mean 80 min; P = 0.02) , and they bled less postoperatively ( mean 295 ml vs. mean 393 ml; P = 0.002). The mean gradient across Perceval valve was 12.5 mmHg while its effective orifice area was 1.5 cm2. In our retrospective study of 763 patients , sutureless valve group patients are older , mostly women , more symptomatic preoperatively , and have higher logistic EuroSCORE. They have shorter cross-clamp and bypass times , less postoperative bleeding , and reduced incidence of reopening. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical benefits in short , mid , and long-terms.
