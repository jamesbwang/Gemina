  Repulsive guidance molecule A ( RGMa) is implicated in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R) injury , but its mechanisms are still largely unknown. This work focused on the effects of RGMa on the blood-brain barrier ( BBB) after focal cerebral I/R injury. Sprague-Dawley ( SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham , middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO)/ reperfusion ( I/R) , MCAO/reperfusion administered recombinant adenovirus<pathogen> expressing sh-con ( I/R + sh-con) and MCAO/reperfusion administered recombinant adenovirus<pathogen> expressing sh-RGMa ( I/R + sh-RGMa) groups. Infarct volume , brain edema<symptom> and neurological scores were evaluated at 3 day after reperfusion. Evens blue leakage and transmission electron microscopy was performed. And the expression level of claudin-5 and ZO-1 , CDC-42 and PAK-1 , RGMa were detected by western blot. Compared with I/R or I/R + sh-con groups , I/R + sh-RGMa group showed smaller infarction volume , attenuated brain edema<symptom> , improved neurological scores and better BBB integrity , such as reduced Evans blue leakage and ultra-structural change. We also observed improved BBB function followed by down-regulation of MMP-9 and up-regulation of claudin-5 and ZO-1 in the I/R + sh-RGMa group. In addition , up-regulation of the CDC-42 and PAK-1 in the I/R + sh-RGMa group was obtained. RGMa may be involved in I/R injury associated with BBB dysfunction via the CDC-42/ PAK-1 signal pathway and may be a promising therapeutic target for I/R injury.
