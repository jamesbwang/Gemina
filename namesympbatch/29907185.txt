  To quantify ( by qPCR) the density of Demodex canis mites in the skin of dogs with demodicosis and in healthy dogs , as well as measuring the serum concentrations of interleukin ( IL) -1 β , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , and tumour necrosis<symptom> factor-alfa ( TNF-α). Fifty-four dogs were divided into three groups: localized demodicosis ( LD , n = 16) , generalized demodicosis ( GD , n = 22) , and control group ( CG , n = 16). All dogs were subjected to skin scraping , blood collection , and skin biopsy. DNA extraction was performed and the parasite density was established by qPCR. Serum cytokine concentrations were obtained by flow cytometry. The median number of mites in the skin of the GD ( 6.2 × 10 According to our results , qPCR is an effective method for measuring the density of D. canis<pathogen> in the canine integument. In addition , the activation of the acute-phase immune response in localized demodicosis can be induced by IL-6 activity.
