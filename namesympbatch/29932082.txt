  Microbiota is a dynamic system showing individual differences in both the number and species of microorganisms. Dietary habits , lifestyle , age , genetic predisposition of the host and use of antibiotics are effective on microbiota. The aim of our research was to carry out a quantitative comparison of Bifidobacterium<pathogen> spp , Bacteroides<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> , Lactobacillus<pathogen> spp , Akkermansia mucinophilia and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , important bacterial microbiota species , before and after antibiotic therapy treated with tetracycline and metronidazole in patients who are diagnosed as positive for Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( HP) , and to determine the effects of antibiotic use on the microbiota. Eighteen HP-positive patients were enrolled in this study. A special extraction kit ( QIAmp DNA Stool<symptom> Mini<pathogen> Kit , QIAgen , Germany) was used for the DNA isolation procedure. Primers specific to the 16S rRNA region of the bacteria included in the study were used for the amplification of the target region. All the bacteria were subjected to real-time quantification procedure with PCR method on RotorGene Â® 20 device ( Qiagen , Germany). According to quantification before and after antibiotic use in patients receiving HP treatment , statistically significant decreases were observed in Bifidobacterium<pathogen> spp ( p = 0.001) , B.<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> ( p = 0.001) , Lactobacillus<pathogen> spp ( p = 0.001) , A. mucinophilia ( p = 0.001) and F. prausnitzii ( p = 0.001). We were unable to identify B.<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> in the microbiota of five patients after treatment. Based on the data obtained , it can be concluded that antibiotics used to treat HP can prepare the ground that could result in dysbiosis in microbiota.
