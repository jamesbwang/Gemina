  Our goal was to develop a tele-colposcopy platform for primary-care clinics to improve screening sensitivity and access. Specifically , we developed a low-cost , portable Pocket colposcope and evaluated its performance in a tertiary healthcare centre in Peru. Images of the cervix were captured with a standard-of-care and Pocket colposcope at la Liga Contra el CÃ¡ncer in Lima , Peru. Two hundred Peruvian women with abnormal cytology and/or human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> positivity were enrolled. Images were collected using acetic acid and Lugol 's iodine as contrast agents. Biopsies were taken as per standard-of-care procedures. After passing quality review , images from 129 women were sent to four physicians who provided a diagnosis for each image. Physician interpretation of images from the two colposcopes agreed 83.1 % of the time. The average sensitivity and specificity of physician interpretation compared with pathology was similar for the Pocket ( sensitivity = 71.2 % , specificity = 57.5 %) and standard-of-care ( sensitivity = 79.8 % , specificity = 56.6 %) colposcopes. When compared with a previous study where only acetic acid was applied to the cervix , results indicated that adding Lugol 's iodine as a secondary contrast agent improved the percent agreement between colposcopes for all pathological categories by up to 8.9 % and the sensitivity and specificity of physician interpretation compared with pathology by over 6.0 and 9.0 % , respectively. The Pocket colposcope performance was similar to that of a standard-of-care colposcope when used to identify precancerous and cancerous lesions<symptom> using acetic acid and Lugol 's iodine during colposcopy examinations in Peru. The Pocket colposcope performance was similar to that of a standard-of-care colposcope when identifying
