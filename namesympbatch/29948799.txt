  The effects of Enterococcus<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> on growth , intestinal barrier function , and immune response in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O78-challenged broiler chickens were investigated. Three hundred eight 1-day-old Ross male chickens were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: negative control ( C) , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O78-infected positive ( EP) , and E coli O78-infected with 200 mg/kg E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> dietary supplementation ( EF). E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> significantly increased the body<symptom> weight on day 10 ( P < 0.05) and day 15. Furthermore , these birds had a greater average daily gain compared with the other groups during days 1-10 ( P < 0.05). The death rate of the EF chickens dramatically declined. E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> supplementation improved the jejunal villus height and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth ( P < 0.05) 3 and 7 days post-infection. The mRNA expression of claudin-1 significantly increased by E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> ( P < 0.05) 3 and 7 days post-infection , and Mucin2 was markedly enhanced ( P < 0.05) 3 days post-infection. E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> upregulated the mRNA expression of PPAR-γ and IL-10 ( P < 0.05) and downregulated that of NF-κB , TLR4 , and IL-1β ( P < 0.05) in the spleen 3 and 7 days post-infection. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation index was markedly enhanced in the EF group ( P < 0.05) 3 days post-infection. The increased liver E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> number caused by the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O78 challenge was significantly reversed by E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> ( P < 0.05). E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> improved growth and reduced the death rate by regulating the immune response and maintaining the intestinal integrity in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O78-challenged broiler chickens.
