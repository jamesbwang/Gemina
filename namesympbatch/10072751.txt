  Latina<pathogen> women are at increased risk for antenatal depressive disorders , which are common during pregnancy and are associated with elevated risk for poor maternal health and birth outcomes. Physical activity is a potential mechanism to reduce the likelihood of depressive symptoms. The purpose of the study was to assess whether total and domain-specific physical activity in early pregnancy reduced risk for elevated antenatal depressive symptoms in mid-late pregnancy in a population of Latina women at high-risk for depression<symptom> Data from 820 Latina<pathogen> participants in the prospective cohort study Proyecto Buena Salud was examined using multivariable logistic regression. Total , moderate/vigorous , and domain-specific physical activity ( household/caregiving , occupational , sports/exercise , transportation) were assessed using the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression<symptom> Scale was used to assess depressive symptoms and identify women with elevated symptoms indicative of at least probable minor depression<symptom> and probable major depression<symptom> A total of 25.9 % of participants experienced at least probable minor depression<symptom> and 19.1 % probable major depression<symptom> in mid-late pregnancy. After adjusting for important risk factors , no significant associations were observed between total physical activity ( 4th Quartile vs. 1st Quartile OR = 1.02 , 95 % CI = 0.61 , 1.71; p-trend = 0.62) or meeting exercise guidelines in pregnancy ( OR = 0.96 , 95 % CI = 0.65 , 1.41) and at least probable minor depression<symptom> similarly , associations were not observed between these measures and probable major depression<symptom> There was a suggestion of increased risk of probable major depression<symptom> with high levels of household/caregiving activity ( 4th Quartile vs 1st Quartile OR = 1.51 , 95 % CI = 0.93 , 2.46) , but this was attenuated and remained not statistically significant after adjustment. When we repeated the analysis among women who did not have elevated depressive symptoms in early pregnancy ( n = 596) , findings were unchanged , though a nonsignificant protective effect was observed for sport/exercise activity and probable major depression<symptom> in fully adjusted analysis ( OR = 0.63 , 95 % CI = 0.30 , 1.33). Among Latina<pathogen> women at high-risk for antenatal depression<symptom> , early pregnancy physical activity was not associated with elevated depressive symptoms in mid-to-late pregnancy.
