  Functional bowel disorders ( FBDs) are a spectrum of disorders characterized by combinations of symptoms attributable to the lower gastrointestinal tract. Most current first-line therapies for IBS and other FBDs target the predominant symptom and mainly affect one symptom in the symptom complex. Additional broadly effective treatment alternatives targeting the entire symptom complex are needed. New drugs for FBDs ( such as lubiprostone , linaclotide , plecanatide , prucalopride , eluxadoline and rifaximin) target key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of these disorders and improve both the abnormal bowel habit and other key symptoms , such as abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and bloating. The current development of new treatment alternatives is focusing on different aspects of the complex<pathogen> pathophysiology of IBS and other FBDs: gut microenvironment ( via diet and modulation of gut microbiota) , enterohepatic circulation of bile acids , gastrointestinal secretion , motility and sensation , gut-brain interactions , gut barrier function and the immune system within the gastrointestinal tract. Studies also suggest that personalized treatment of IBS and other FBDs is possible using various diagnostic markers.
