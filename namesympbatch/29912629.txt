  SIN3 , a transcriptional corepressor has been implicated in varied functions both as transcription activator and repressor. Recent studies associated Sin3 with the macroautophagic/autophagic process as a negative regulator of Atg8 and Atg32. Though the role of SIN3 in autophagy is being explored , little is known about the overall effect of SIN3 deletion on the survival of an organism. In this study using a Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> sin-3 ( tm1279); him-5 ( e1490) strain , we demonstrate that under in vivo conditions SIN-3 differentially modulates autophagy and lifespan. We provide evidence that the enhanced autophagy and decreased lifespan observed in sin-3 deletion mutants is dependent on ROS and intracellular oxidative stress. Inability of the mutant worms to maintain redox balance<symptom> along with dysregulation of enzymatic antioxidants , depletion of GSH and NADP reserves and elevation of ROS markers compromises the longevity of the worms. It is possible that the enhanced autophagic process observed in sin-3 ( tm1279); him-5 ( e1490) worms is required to compensate for oxidative stress generated in these worms. cat: catalase; DCFDA: 2 ' ,7 '- dichlorodihydrofluoroscein diacetate; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSSG: oxidized glutathione; H
