  Eggerthella<pathogen> timonensis<pathogen> strain Marseille-P3135 is a new bacterial species , isolated from the stool<symptom> sample of a healthy 8-year-old pygmy female. This strain ( LT598568) showed a 16S rRNA sequence similarity of 96.95 % with its phylogenetically closest species with standing in nomenclature Eggerthella<pathogen> lenta<pathogen> strain DSM 2243 ( AF292375). This bacterium<pathogen> is a nonspore forming , Gram-positive , nonmotile rod with catalase but no oxidase activity. Its genome is 3,916,897 bp long with 65.17 mol % of G + C content. Of the 3,371 predicted genes , 57 were RNAs and 3,314 were protein-coding genes. Here , we report the main phenotypic , biochemical , and genotypic characteristics of E. timonensis<pathogen> strain Marseille-P3135 ( = CSUR P3135 , = CCUG 70327); ti.mo.nen ` sis , N.L. masc. adj. , with timonensis<pathogen> referring to La Timone , which is the name of the hospital in Marseille ( France) where this work was performed). Strain is a nonmotile Gram-positive rod , unable to sporulate , oxidase negative , and catalase positive. It grows under anaerobic conditions between 25 °C and 42 °C but optimally at 37 °C.
