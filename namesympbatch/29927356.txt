  To develop an effective biological agent to control S. sclerotiorum<pathogen> , three endophytic Bacillus<pathogen> spp. strains with high antagonistic activity were isolated from maize seeds and characterized. In vitro assays revealed that the Bacillus<pathogen> endophytes could produce volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) that reduced sclerotial production , and inhibited mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum<pathogen>. Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry ( GC-MS) revealed that the selected strains produced sixteen detectable VOCs. Eight of the produced VOCs exhibited negative effects on S. sclerotiorum<pathogen> , while a further four induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in mycelial cells. Mixture of VOCs produced by Bacillus<pathogen> strain VM11 caused morphological changes in the ultra structure and organelle membranes<symptom> of S. sclerotiorum<pathogen> mycelial cells. The bromophenol blue assay revealed yellow color of untreated fungal mycelium , which grew fast and deeper from 24 to 72 hours post inoculation ( hpi) , as an indication of reduced pH. The potasium permanganate ( KMnO
