  Primary Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( H pylori) infection is acquired predominantly in childhood in the family setting. We aimed to investigate the presence of intrafamilial concurrent H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection. Cross-sectional analytical study with a control group , conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Fifty adult patients with gastroduodenal symptoms who underwent gastroscopy ( index parents) , their spouses and their children were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were collected from all of the study subjects to test for immunoglobulin G ( IgG) antibody response. H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> antigen was investigated in the stool<symptom> specimens of children only. The participants were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of the 40 patients in whom H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection was demonstrated via endoscopy , their spouses and their children. Group 2 included the remaining 10 patients who underwent endoscopy revealing negative results for H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> , their spouses and their children. IgG antibodies were present in all of the index parents , 95 % of their spouses and 93 % of their children in group 1; 13 of the children ( 9 %) were also positive for H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> stool<symptom> antigen ( HpSA). However , IgG antibodies were present in only 2 of the 10 index parents in group 2. One of their spouses and one of their children had a positive antibody response. All of their children had negative stool<symptom> antigen test results. H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infections exhibit intrafamilial clustering. Parental infection , age â‰¥ years and having three or more siblings are the major risk factors for H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection in children.
