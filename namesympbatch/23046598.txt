  Transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs) is a promising new therapy for heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , the current cell delivery routes result in poor donor cell engraftment. We therefore explored the role of fibrin glue ( FG)- aided , instant epicardial placement to enhance the efficacy of MSC-based therapy in a rat ischemic cardiomyopathy model. We identified a feasible and reproducible method to instantly produce a FG-MSC complex directly on the heart surface. This complex<pathogen> exhibited prompt , firm adhesion to the heart , markedly improving initial retention of donor MSCs compared to intramyocardial injection. In addition , maintenance of retained MSCs was enhanced using this method , together contributing the increased donor cell presence. Such increased donor cell quantity using the FG-aided technique led to further improved cardiac function in association with augmented histological myocardial repair , which correlated with upregulation of tissue repair-related genes. We identified that the epicardial layer was eliminated shortly after FG-aided epicardial placement of MSCs , facilitating permeation of the donor MSC 's secretome into the myocardium enabling myocardial repair. These data indicate that FG-aided , on-site , instant epicardial placement enhances MSC engraftment , promoting the efficacy of MSC-based therapy for heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Further development of this accessible , advanced MSC-therapy is justified.
