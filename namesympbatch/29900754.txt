  To explore circulating miRNA-302 family members for acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AHF) diagnosis. Three groups of subjects , in other words , AHF patients , AHF free patients and healthy controls were recruited. Circulating levels of miR-302 family members were measured and analyzed for AHF diagnosis. Plasma miR-302s except miR-302f were significantly elevated in AHF patients. MiR-302b-3p had the highest area under curve value of 0.87. There were strong positive correlations between miR-302s and NT-proBNP levels. MiR-302b-3p levels were significantly higher in left ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤ 45 % and New<pathogen> York Heart Association class IV patients compared with left ventricular ejection fraction > 45 % and New<pathogen> York Heart Association class II patients , respectively. Levels of circulating miR-302s , miR-302b-3p in particular , could be potentially applied for AHF diagnosis and the differentiation of disease severity.
