  Metabolic acidosis is commonly found in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD) , and its causes are: impaired ammonia<pathogen> excretion , reduced tubular bicarbonate reabsorption and insufficient renal bicarbonate production in relation to the amount of acids synthesised by the body and ingested with food. As the consequence , numerous metabolic abnormalities develop , which may lead to dysfunction of several organs. In observational studies , it has been found that CKD patients with metabolic acidosis are characterised by faster progression of kidney disease towards end stage kidney failure , and by increased mortality. Results of interventional studies suggest that alkali therapy in CKD patients slows progression of kidney disease. In view of these facts , the members of `` The Working Group of the Polish Society of Nephrology on Metabolic and Endocrine Abnormalities in Kidney Diseases '' have prepared the following statement and guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD patients. Measurement of bicarbonate concentration in venous plasma or venous blood<symptom> to check for metabolic acidosis should be performed in all CKD patients and metabolic acidosis in these patients should be diagnosed when the venous plasma or venous blood bicarbonate concentration is lower than 22 mmol/l. In patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD , oral sodium bicarbonate administration is recommended. The goal of such a treatment is to achieve a plasma or blood bicarbonate concentration equal to or greater than 22 mmol/l.
