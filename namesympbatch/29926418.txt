  For the physicochemical studies aimed at elucidating the dynamic of gangliosides in membranes<symptom> and their interaction with proteins and membrane lipids , photoactivatable and paramagnetic ganglioside derivatives have proved to be invaluable tools. Here , protocols for the synthesis of such ganglioside derivatives are described. These derivatives bear<pathogen> in their ceramide portion either a highly photoreactive ( 3-trifluoromethyl) phenyldiazirinyl- or a spin active doxyl-labeled acyl chain in place of their natural acyl chain.
