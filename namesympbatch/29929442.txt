  Corneal blindness<symptom> is the third leading cause of blindness<symptom> in the world , and one of the main etiologies is dysfunction of the corneal endothelium. Current treatment of corneal endothelial disease is allogenic corneal transplantation , which is limited by the global shortage of donor corneas<symptom> and immunological rejection. The corneal endothelium consists of a monolayer of cells derived from the neural crest and mesoderm. Its main function is to prevent corneal edema<symptom> by tight junctions formed by zonular occludens-1 ( ZO-1) and Na , K-ATPase pump function. The human umbilical cord ( UC) is a rich source of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs). UC-MSCs that have multi-lineage potential may be an accessible allogenic source. After inducing differentiation with medium<pathogen> containing glycogen synthase kinase ( GSK) 3-Î² inhibitor , UC-MSCs formed polygonal corneal endothelial-like cells that functioned as tissue-engineered corneal endothelium ( UTECE). Expressions of major corneal endothelial markers were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR ( qRT-PCR). Western blotting confirmed the expression of Na,K-ATPase and PITX2 , the functional and developmental markers of corneal endothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed the localization of Na,K-ATPase and ZO-1 in cell-cell junctions , suggesting the presence of tight junctions. In vitro functional analysis revealed that UTECE had significantly high pump function compared with UC-MSCs. Moreover , UTECE transplanted into a rabbit model of bullous keratopathy successfully maintained corneal thickness and transparency. Our findings suggest that UTECE may be used as a source of allogenic cells for the treatment of corneal endothelial disease.
