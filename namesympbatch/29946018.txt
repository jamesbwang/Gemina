  Angiosperms germinated in the dark develop etioplasts , the chloroplast precursors , in cotyledon cells. Etioplasts contain lattice membrane structures called prolamellar bodies ( PLBs) and lamellar prothylakoids ( PTs) as internal membrane systems. PLBs accumulate the chlorophyll intermediate protochlorophyllide ( Pchlide) in a complex<pathogen> with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH: Pchlide oxidoreductase ( LPOR). Two galactolipids , monogalactosyldiacylglycerol ( MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol ( DGDG) , are major constituents of etioplast membranes<symptom>. We previously reported that MGDG facilitates the synthesis of Pchlide and formation of the Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex in etioplasts , but the importance of DGDG in etioplasts is still unknown. To determine the role of DGDG in etioplast development and functions , we characterized a knockout mutant ( dgd1) of Arabidopsis thaliana DGD1 , which encodes the major isoform of DGDG synthase , in the etioplast-development stage. In etiolated dgd1 seedlings , DGDG content decreased to 20 % of the wild-type level , the lattice structure of PLBs was disordered , and the development of PTs was impaired. In addition , membrane-associated processes of Pchlide biosynthesis , formation of the Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and dissociation of the complex<pathogen> after photoconversion of Pchlide to chlorophyllide were impaired in dgd1 , although the photoconversion reaction by LPOR was not affected by the DGDG deficiency. Total carotenoid content also decreased in etiolated dgd1 seedlings , but the carotenoid composition was unchanged. Our data demonstrate a deep involvement of DGDG in the formation of the internal membrane structures in etioplasts as well as membrane-associated processes of the pigment biosynthesis and the pigment-protein complex organization.
