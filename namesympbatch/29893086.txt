  An in vitro synthesized random ssDNA<pathogen> library was subjected to 12 rounds of selection against anti-screening cells and sieving cells by SELEX. Normal and inflammatory cervical exfoliation cells were selected as anti-screening cells , and the cervical exfoliation cells of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion<symptom> ( CIN1) , high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion<symptom> ( CIN2 , CIN3) and cervical carcinoma were selected as sieving cells during the screening process. Then , the highly specific aptamer CIN-Ap4 was established by the analysis of the specificity , affinity and cell immunofluorescence , which can be used as biomarker for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia. Prime Premier 5.0 was applied to design a random ssDNA<pathogen> library. According to the fixed sequence at both ends of the library , a pair of primers were designed and synthesized. At the same time , the optimal annealing temperature , cycle times and primer concentration ratio of PCR procedure were selected. The results under the optimal condition are shown as follows. In the 50 μL reaction system , the optimum reaction conditions of symmetry PCR are as follows: annealing temperature is 49.5 ℃ , number of cycles is 15. The optimal reaction conditions of indirect asymmetric PCR are as follows: the primer concentration ratio is 80:1 , and the number of cycles is 35. The experiment proves that the oligonucleotide library is constructed successfully , and the highly specific dsDNA and ssDNA<pathogen> can be obtained under optimal PCR conditions with good repeatability , which establishes the foundation for the further exploration and experimentation.
