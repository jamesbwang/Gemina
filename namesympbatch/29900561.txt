  The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts ( RAGE) has been implicated as a critical molecule in the pathogenesis of experimental asthma/allergic airway inflammation<symptom> ( AAI). It has been previously shown that RAGE acts both upstream of interleukin-33 ( IL-33) release and downstream of IL-33 release via RAGE-dependent IL-33 induced accumulation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s) in the lungs , which perpetuate type 2 inflammation<symptom> and mucus metaplasia. However , the mechanism by which RAGE mediates downstream IL-33 induced type 2 inflammatory responses is unknown. This study tests the hypothesis that ILC2s are recruited to the lungs via RAGE-dependent vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM-1) expression on lung endothelial cells. House dust mite extract , Alternaria<pathogen> alternata<pathogen> extract or rIL-33 were used to induce AAI/VCAM -1 expression in wild-type ( WT) and RAGE-knockout ( RAGE-KO) mice. Intravenous ( i.v.) anti-VCAM1 or intraperitoneal ( i.p.) β7 blocking antibody administration was used to determine the role of VCAM-1 in IL-33 induced AAI. Enhanced VCAM-1 expression in the lungs by HDM , AA , or rIL-33 exposure was found to be RAGE dependent. In addition , stimulation of primary mouse lung endothelial cells with IL-33 induced VCAM-1 expression in WT , but not RAGE-KO cells. Administration of VCAM-1 and β7 integrin blocking antibodies reduced IL-33 induced eosinophilic inflammation<symptom> , mucus metaplasia , and type 2 inflammatory responses CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that allergen and cytokine-induced VCAM-1 expression is RAGE dependent , and contributes to lung ILC2 accumulation and downstream eosinophilic inflammation<symptom> , mucus metaplasia , and type 2 inflammatory responses.
