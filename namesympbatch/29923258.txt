  No prior studies have addressed the performance of electronic health record ( EHR) data to diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) in people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLWH) , in whom COPD could be more likely to be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed , given the higher frequency of respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> and smoking compared with HIV-uninfected ( uninfected) persons. We determined whether EHR data could improve accuracy of ICD-9 codes to define COPD when compared with spirometry in PLWH vs uninfected , and quantified level of discrimination using the area under the receiver-operating curve ( AUC). The development cohort consisted of 350 participants who completed research spirometry in the Examinations of HIV<pathogen> Associated Lung Emphysema ( EXHALE) study , a pulmonary substudy of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. Results were externally validated in 294 PLWH who performed spirometry for clinical indications from the University of Washington ( UW) site of the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems cohort. ICD-9 codes performed similarly by HIV<pathogen> status , but alone were poor at discriminating cases from non-cases of COPD when compared with spirometry ( AUC 0.633 in EXHALE; 0.651 in the UW cohort). However , algorithms that combined ICD-9 codes with other clinical variables available in the EHR-age , smoking , and COPD inhalers-improved discrimination and performed similarly in EXHALE ( AUC 0.771) and UW ( AUC 0.734). These data support that EHR data in combination with ICD-9 codes have moderately good accuracy to identify COPD when spirometry data are not available , and perform similarly in PLWH and uninfected individuals.
