  The emergence of multidrug-resistant ( MDR) Escherichia<pathogen> coli ( E coli) , particularly E coli sequence type ST131 , is becoming a global concern. Commensal bacteria , an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes , facilitate the spread of such genes to pathogenic bacterial strains. The objective of the study is to investigate the fecal carriage of MDR E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and ST131 E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in community children in Southern Taiwan. In this prospective study , stool<symptom> samples from children aged 0-18 years were obtained within 3 days of hospitalization from October 2013 to September 2014. Children with a history of underlying diseases , antibiotic treatment , or hospitalization in the 3 months before specimen collection were excluded. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> colonies were selected and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility , and O25b-ST131 , multilocus sequence typing , and blaCTX-M gene groups were detected. Among 157 E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates , the rates of nonsusceptibility to ampicillin , amoxycillin + clavulanate , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , and cefazolin were 70 , 65.6 , 47.1 , and 32.5 % , respectively. Twenty-nine ( 18.5 %) isolates were nonsusceptible to ciprofloxacin. MDR E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> accounted for 58 ( 37 %) of all isolates. Thirteen ( 8.3 %) isolates produced extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase ( ESBL). Furthermore , 26 ( 16.6 %) and 13 ( 8.3 %) isolates were O25b and ST131 positive , respectively. Five ( 38.5 %) of the 13 ESBL-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> belonged to blaCTX-M group 9 , among which were CTXM-14 and 4 ( 80 %) were O25b-ST131 positive. Compared with the non-ESBL and ciprofloxacin-susceptible groups , the ESBL and ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible groups showed significantly higher rates of O25b-ST131 positivity. The prevalence of the fecal carriage of nonsusceptible E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in children was high; among these E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , 37 % were MDR , 18.5 % were nonsusceptible to ciprofloxacin , and 8.3 % produced ESBL. O25b-ST131 was the most common ESBL-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> clonal group present in the feces of children , and the ESBL and ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible groups showed significantly higher rates of O25b-ST131 positivity.
