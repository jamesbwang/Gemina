  Institutional studies suggest robotic mitral surgery may be associated with superior outcomes. The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of robotic , minimally invasive ( mini) , and conventional mitral surgery. A total of 2300 patients undergoing non-emergent isolated mitral valve operations from 2011 to 2016 were extracted from a regional Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. Patients were stratified by approach: robotic ( n = 372) , mini<pathogen> ( n = 576) and conventional sternotomy ( n = 1352). To account for preoperative differences , robotic cases were propensity score matched ( 1:1) to both conventional and mini approaches. The robotic cases were well matched to the conventional ( n = 314) and mini<pathogen> ( n = 295) cases with no significant baseline differences. Rates of mitral repair were high in the robotic and mini cohorts ( 91 %) , but significantly lower with conventional ( 76 % , P < 0.0001) despite similar rates of degenerative disease. All procedural times were longest in the robotic cohort , including operative time ( 224 vs 168 min conventional , 222 vs 180 min mini<pathogen>; all P < 0.0001). The robotic approach had comparable outcomes to the conventional approach except there were fewer discharges to a facility ( 7 % vs 15 % , P = 0.001) and 1 less day in the hospital ( P < 0.0001). However , compared with the mini<pathogen> approach , the robotic approach had more transfusions ( 15 % vs 5 % , P < 0.0001) , higher atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> rates ( 26 % vs 18 % , P = 0.01) , and 1 day longer average hospital stay ( P = 0.02). Despite longer procedural times , robotic and mini patients had similar complication rates with higher repair rates and shorter length of stay metrics compared with conventional surgery. However , the robotic approach was associated with higher atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> rates , more transfusions and longer postoperative stays compared with minimally invasive approach.
