  This study 's primary objective was to validate the routine use of S100B via a prospective study. The aim was a reduction of cranial computed tomography ( CCT) scans by 30 %. The secondary goal was to investigate the influence of age and associated risk factors on the reduction of CCT. S100B ( sampling within 3 h postinjury) was used for patients with mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBIs) presenting a medium<pathogen> risk of complications and requiring a CCT scan. Patients with negative S100B ( S100B-) were discharged without a CCT scan. Of the 1449 patients included in this study , 468 ( 32.3 %) had S100B- with a sensitivity of 96.4 % ( 95 % CI: 87.5 % -99.6 %) , a specificity of 33.4 % ( 95 % CI: 31 % -36 %) and a negative predictive value of 99.6 % ( 95 % CI: 98.5 % -99.9 %). No significant difference in serum levels or the S100B + rate was observed if patients had retrograde amnesia ( 0.16 Î¼g/L; 63.8 %) , loss of consciousness<symptom> ( 0.13; 63.6 %) or antiplatelet therapy ( 0.20; 77.9 %). Significant differences were found between the S100B concentrations and S100B positivity rates in patients > 65 years old and all the groups with patients < 55 years old ( 18-25 , 26-35 , 36-45 and 46-55). From 18 to 65 years old ( n = 874) , the specificity is 39.3 % ( 95 % CI: 36 % -42.6 %) compared to 18.7 % ( 95 % CI: 15.3 % -22.3 %) for patients > 65 years old ( n = 504). The clinical use of S100B in mTBI management reduces the use of CCTs by approximately one-third; furthermore , the percentage of CCTs reduction is influenced by the age of the patient.
