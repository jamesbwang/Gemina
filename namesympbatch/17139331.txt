  Strong interactions between lipids and proteins occur primarily through association of charged headgroups and amino acid side chains , rendering the protonation status of both partners important. Here we use native mass spectrometry to explore lipid binding as a function of charge of the outer membrane porin F ( OmpF). We find that binding of anionic phosphatidylglycerol ( POPG) or zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine ( POPC) to OmpF is sensitive to electrospray polarity while the effects of charge are less pronounced for other proteins in outer or mitochondrial membranes<symptom>: the ferripyoverdine receptor ( FpvA) or the voltage-dependent anion channel ( VDAC). Only marginal charge-induced differences were observed for inner membrane proteins: the ammonia<pathogen> channel ( AmtB) or the mechanosensitive channel. To understand these different sensitivities , we performed an extensive bioinformatics analysis of membrane protein structures and found that OmpF , and to a lesser extent FpvA and VDAC , have atypically high local densities of basic and acidic residues in their lipid headgroup-binding regions. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations , in mixed lipid bilayers , further implicate changes in charge by demonstrating preferential binding of anionic POPG over zwitterionic POPC to protonated OmpF , an effect not observed to the same extent for AmtB. Moreover , electrophysiology and mass-spectrometry-based ligand-binding experiments , at low pH , show that POPG can maintain OmpF channels in open conformations for extended time periods. Since the outer membrane is composed almost entirely of anionic lipopolysaccharide , with similar headgroup properties to POPG , such anionic lipid binding could prevent closure of OmpF channels , thereby increasing access of antibiotics that use porin-mediated pathways.
