  Biosynthesis of nanoparticles by fermented plants using microbes is an eco-friendly and cost-effective process. In this study , we used the fungus Aspergillus<pathogen> orayzae for the fermentation process. The aqueous extract of fermented Lupin ( AEFL) possesses the ability to reduce selenium ion in the presence of gamma rays evidenced by the color<symptom> changes<symptom> to red. Elemental composition , surface morphology , size determenation , and identity of selenium nanoparticles ( SeNPs) were verified by UV-Vis. , TEM , DLS , XRD , EDX , SEM and FT-IR. Antimicrobial activity of SeNPs was tested towards multidrug-resistant ( MDR) bacteria , and some pathogenic fungi<pathogen> TEM with DLS analysis confirmed the formation of sphere isotropic , poly-dispersed SeNPs with average particle size 55.0 nm. The nucleation and mechanism of SeNPs production was discussed. Our results revealed that , gamma ray ( 30.0 kGy) was played a significant role in SeNPs synthesis. The synthesized SeNPs were active towards Acinetobacter<pathogen> calcoaceticus<pathogen> ( 15.0 mm ZOI) and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aurus ( 16.6 mm ZOI). Additionally , SeNPs were inhibiting Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> ( 15.3 mm ZOI) and mycotoxin producing Aspergillus<pathogen> flavus<pathogen> ( 29.6 mm ZOI). Depending on the unique characteristics , and the novelty in biosynthesis process of SeNPs , it must be candidates in biomedicine , prevent food spoilage , cosmetics , and pharmaceutics as green antimicrobial agent.
