  The aim of the study was to examine whether anxiety<symptom> and depressive symptoms are associated with an adverse cardiac autonomic profile among midlife women with hot flashes. Anxiety<symptom> and depressive symptoms were evaluated by validated self-administered questionnaires among peri- and postmenopausal women in a randomized trial of slow-paced respiration<symptom> for hot flashes. Pre-ejection period ( PEP) , a marker of sympathetic activation , and respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA<pathogen>) , a marker of parasympathetic activation , were measured at baseline and 12 weeks using impedance cardiography and electocardiography. Multivariable repeated measures linear regression models examined associations between anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms and autonomic markers , corrected for multiple comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure , and adjusted for age and body mass index. Among the 121 participants , greater state anxiety<symptom> was associated with shorter PEP , reflecting higher sympathetic activity ( β = -0.24 , P = 0.02). Greater trait anxiety<symptom> and cognitive anxiety<symptom> were associated with lower RSA<pathogen> , reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity ( β = -0.03 , P < 0.01 for Spielberger Trait Anxiety; β = -0.06 , P = 0.02 for Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale ( HADS) Anxiety<symptom> Subscale). Greater depressive symptoms were associated with lower RSA<pathogen> ( β = -0.06 , P = 0.03 for HADS Depression<symptom> Subscale; β = -0.03 , P = 0.04 for Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory). Among peri- and postmenopausal women with hot flashes , greater self-reported anxiety<symptom> and depressive symptoms were associated with lower levels of resting cardiac parasympathetic activity , and greater state anxiety<symptom> was associated with higher levels of cardiac sympathetic activity. Findings suggest that midlife women with increased anxiety<symptom> and depressive symptoms may have an unfavorable cardiac autonomic profile with potential implications for their overall cardiovascular risk.
