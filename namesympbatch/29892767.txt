  We analyzed the structure-activity relationship of porphyrins with the photoinactivation of membrane function in bacteria and erythrocytes. The porphyrins tested were protoporphyrin ( PP) , mesoporphyrin ( MP) , deuteroporphyrin ( DP) , hematoporphyrin ( HP) , coproporphyrin ( CP) and uroporphyrin ( UP) , along with hematoporphyrin derivative ( HPD) and photofrin ( PF). These porphyrins dissipated membrane potential of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> cells depending on the degrees of respiratory inhibition and K + leakage. The dysfunction of bacterial membrane was caused within minutes and in the order of PP ∼ MP > DP > HPD ≫ HP > PF > CP ∼ UP. For bovine erythrocytes , these porphyrins induced leakage of K + and inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase , which is located on the outer layer of the erythrocyte membrane , in the same order as that observed in bacteria. At high concentrations of PP , MP , DP and HPD , hemolysis<symptom> ( the lysis of erythrocytes with liberation of hemoglobin) was also induced. We found that the degree of photoinactivation of membrane function was closely associated with porphyrin-induced morphological changes in bovine erythrocytes , forming a crenated form from the normal discoid , which is the index of the amount of porphyrins in the outer layer of the cytoplasmic membrane. Furthermore , the degree of morphological changes was related with the octanol/water partition coefficients of porphyrins. These results strongly supported that porphyrins located in the outer layer of cytoplasmic membrane inactivated the cell membrane function by photo-irradiation , and the strength of photoinactivation by porphyrins depended on their affinity to the cell membrane.
