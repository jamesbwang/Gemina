  To the multiple factors that may eventually result in colorectal cancer ( CRC) , strains of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> have now been added , in particular strains producing colibactin from their polyketide synthesis ( pks) locus. The evidence and mechanistic explanations for this unfortunate effect of what is in most cases a harmless commensal are discussed in the first part of this review. In the second part , observations are presented and discussed that do not fit with the hypothesis that colibactin-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> produce CRC. The last part of this review is reserved for an alternative explanation of the function of this enigmatic colibactin , a toxin that has not yet been isolated. It is hypothesized that E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> preferentially colonizes cancerous lesions<symptom> as an effect rather than a cause and that colibactin production provides a selective advantage to compete with other bacteria.
