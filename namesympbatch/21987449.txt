  The incidence of abnormal cervical smears in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE) is 3.6 %. Data regarding specific high-risk HPV ( hrHPV) genotypes are insufficient. Identification of hrHPV subtypes is essential to allow formulating effective vaccination strategies. A total of 75 archival cervical cone biopsies with HSIL or higher lesions<symptom> ( 2012-2016) were retrieved from a tertiary hospital , including HSIL ( n = 70) , adenocarcinoma in-situ ( n = 1) and squamous cell carcinoma ( n = 4). Five tissue sections ( 10-Î¼-thick each) were cut and DNA extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit. GenomeMeTM 's GeneNavTM HPV One qPCR Kit was used for specific detection of HPV 16 and 18; and non-16/ 18 samples were typed by GenomeMeTM 's GeneNavTM HPV Genotyping qPCR Kit. Median age was 34 years ( range 19-58) with 70 % UAE Nationals. hrHPV detected were 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 58 , 59 , 66 & 68. hrHPV testing was negative in 12 % of cases. Most common types were HPV 16 ( 49 %) , HPV 31 ( 20 %) and HPV 18 ( 6.6 %). hrHPV 16 and/or 18 represented 56 % and rare subtypes 32 %. Co-infection was present in 16 %. Eight cases had two-viral subtype infections and 4 cases had 3 subtype<pathogen> infections. Multi-viral HPV infection was limited to hrHPV 16 , 18 , 31 & 33 subtypes. Infection by non HPV 16/18 is fairly common. A higher than expected incidence of rare subtype ( 20 % hrHPV31) and multi-viral hrHPV ( 16 %) were detected. This finding stresses the importance of this pilot study as currently only quadravalent vaccine is offered to control the HPV infection in the UAE population.
