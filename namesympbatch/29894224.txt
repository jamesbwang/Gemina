  Previous studies have shown that botulinum<pathogen> toxin can be an important adjunct to management of convergence spasm. However , we have not experienced the same level of success in our cohort of patients. Using retrospective review , we collected data on patients presenting to our department with convergence spasm. This included presenting symptoms , examination findings , response to atropine and plus lenses , number and dosage of botulinum<pathogen> toxin injections received , and the status at last follow-up/discharge. We identified a total of 6 patients with a male: female ratio of 1:1 and mean age of 44.3 years. Commonest symptom was diplopia<symptom> followed by headache<symptom> and blurred vision. Depression<symptom> was present in 4 out of 6 patients. Average pre-injection deviation for near was 32.5 PD ET ( Prism Diopters esotropia) and for distance was 27.7 PD ET. All of the patients received botulinum<pathogen> toxin injections to the medial rectus<pathogen> muscle. The response to toxin was variable with an average near deviation at 2 weeks of 10 PD XT ( exotropia) , range 20 PD XT to 25 PD ET and at 3 months 12.5 PD ET ( 10 PD XT to 35 PD ET). At the last follow-up , after the toxin effect had worn off , all the patients returned to the pre-injection levels and the symptoms recurred. The response of patients with convergence spasm to botulinum<pathogen> toxin was variable with a recurrence of the deviation once the effect wore off. In our experience , botulinum<pathogen> toxin has a limited role in the management of convergence spasm.
