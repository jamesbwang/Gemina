  OBJECTIVE Isolated subdural hematomas ( iSDHs) are one of the most common intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) types<pathogen> in the population with mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI; Glasgow Coma<symptom> Scale score 13-15) , account for 66 % -75 % of all neurosurgical procedures , and have one of the highest neurosurgical intervention rates. The objective of this study was to examine how quantitative hemorrhage<symptom> characteristics of iSDHs in patients with mTBI at admission are associated with subsequent neurosurgical intervention. METHODS This was a 3.5-year , retrospective observational cohort study at a Level I trauma center. All adult trauma patients with mTBI and iSDHs were included in the study. Maximum length and thickness ( in mm) of acute SDHs , the presence of acute-on-chronic SDH , mass effect , and other hemorrhage-related variables were double-data entered; discrepant results were adjudicated after a maximum of 4 reviews. Patients with coagulopathy , skull fractures , no acute<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom> , a non-SDH ICH , or who did not undergo imaging on admission were excluded. The primary outcome was neurosurgical intervention ( craniotomy , burr hole , catheter drainage of SDH , placement of intracranial pressure monitor , shunt , or ventriculostomy). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression was used to identify significant covariates and to assess interactions. RESULTS A total of 176 patients were included in our study: 28 patients did and 148 patients did not receive a neurosurgical intervention. Increasing head Abbreviated Injury Scale score was significantly associated with neurosurgical interventions. There was a strong correlation between the first 3 reviews on maximum hemorrhage<symptom> length ( R
