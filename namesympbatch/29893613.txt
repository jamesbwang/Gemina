  Broomrape produces serious damage to many legume crops and , particularly , becomes a limiting factor for faba bean ( Vicia faba L.) production in the Mediterranean basin. Currently , several traditional methods of control have been developed , but none has proved to be effective for this parasite. However , breeding for resistance to this pest remains as one of the most feasible and environment-friendly methods for managing broomrape , but the mechanisms governing the interaction between the parasite and the host are not yet well understood. Therefore , we studied the behavior and molecular and enzymatic changes associated with the resistance to Orobanche foetida in faba bean mutants , which were obtained through radiation mutagenesis. Three faba bean genotypes were used in this study , the variety ` Bad√Ø ' , characterized by high productivity in Orobanche-free soils and susceptibility to O. foetida , and two mutant lines P2M3 and P7M3 ( derived from radio mutagenesis program) , selected for their higher resistance to O. foetida in a field evaluation. The infection progress and the relative changes in the co-culture response , the enzymatic activities changes and the efficiency of the root extract stimulants from the host plant were followed and evaluated in all the genotypes. Experiments showed that low induction of seed germination is a major component of resistance in these lines against O. foetida. This is confirmed by the in vitro experiments with root exudates<symptom>. The parallel reduction in infection was accompanied by the continuous enhancement of the peroxidase activity , the polyphenol oxidase activity and the phenylalanine ammonia<pathogen> lyase activity in faba bean roots. These data suggest the contribution of these enzymes in faba bean resistance to O. foetida broomrape induced by the use of gamma rays. Management of Orobanche by way of crop selection , based on these enzyme systems is a possible option.
