  Lipid emulsions administered intravenously are normally rapidly metabolized by apoprotein recruited from HDL particles in the blood. However very low<symptom> birth<symptom> infants ( VLBWIs) have low rates of lipid clearance of from their blood and so lipid emulsions must be administered carefully to minimize the risk of hyperlipidemia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of intravenous lipid emulsion on the lipoprotein subclass profiles in VLBWIs during the early postnatal period. Forty-six VLBWIs who had been administered different doses of lipid emulsion in the first few days after birth were included. Triglyceride and cholesterol contents of each lipoprotein subclasses were measured at 3 weeks after birth and their correlation with the total dose of lipid emulsion administered was calculated. There was no correlation between the total dose of lipid emulsion administered and the triglyceride and cholesterol content in any subclasses of VLDL and LDL. There was a significant negative correlation between the total dose of lipid emulsion administered and the triglyceride content in very large ( p < 0.05 , r = -0.32) , large ( p < 0.01 , r = -0.47) and medium<pathogen> HDL ( p < 0.05 , r = -0.34) particles , and the cholesterol content in large ( p < 0.01 , r = -0.47) and medium<pathogen> HDL ( p < 0.01 , r = -0.4) particles. The administration of lipid emulsion influenced triglyceride and cholesterol contents of HDL particles in VLBWIs. These findings suggest that administering lipid emulsion can affect lipid metabolism in this infant population in the early postnatal period. This article is protected by copyright.
