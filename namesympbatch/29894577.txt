  Our main objective was to compare Cutibacterium<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> ( C.<pathogen> acnes<pathogen>) skin colonisation in patients with mild to moderate acne versus healthy controls and secondly , to evaluate a Myrtacine In 60 acne patients ( Global Acne Severity Scale , GEA grades 2-3) , of mean age 20 ( 15-30) years and in 24 age- and sex- matched healthy controls , forehead strips samplings were performed for microbiological analysis of comedones by colony forming unit ( CFU) counts of global C.<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> and erythromycin ( EryR) or clindamycin-resistant ( ClnR) populations of Cutibacterium<pathogen> and determination of phylotypes by MALTI-TOF. Clinical evaluations of acne patients ( GEA , lesion<symptom> count , porphyrin fluorescence) were performed at baseline and after 56 days of twice-daily application of a Myrtacine We first showed ( i) high and similar levels of C acnes colonisation in superficial pilosebaceous follicles and detection of EryR and ClnR strains in both acne and control groups; ( ii) different repartition of phylotypes in acne patients versus healthy control , with a predominance of phylotype IA in acne patients and a link between phylotype IA and erythromycin resistance. Besides , after treatment with the Myrtacine Cutibacterium<pathogen> acnes colonisation was not significantly different in acne versus control groups. Phylotype IA was predominant in acne patient and in EryR C.<pathogen> acnes<pathogen>. A Myrtacine
