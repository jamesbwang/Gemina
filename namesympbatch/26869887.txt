  In November 2012 , a 72-year old patient was diagnosed with left eye wet age-related macular degeneration. The patient received three monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab , with complete resolution of retinal hemorrhage<symptom> and edema<symptom> and reinstatement of visual acuity. In May 2015 , symptomatic relapse was detected. The patient was again treated with intravitreal ranibizumab , with overall six injections till the end of February 2016. In May 2016 , the patient complained of left hand resting tremor<symptom> , bradykinesia<symptom> , and postural rigidity of head and trunk. A diagnosis of clinically established PD was made based on new criteria of the Movement Disorders Society. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography of the Dopamine Transporter with ( 123I) ioflupane documented a low Dopamine Transporter ( DAT) uptake mostly in the right striatum<pathogen>. Due to the documented protective role of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) on the dopaminergic neurons , intensive intravitreal injections of the anti-VEGF agent ranibizumab may have played as an additional risk factor accelerating the neurodegeneration process related to PD and the onset of the related clinical signs and symptoms.
