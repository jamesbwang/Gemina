  The dried roots of Sophora flavescens<pathogen> Ait. ( Leguminosae) is traditionally used as antipyretic medicine to reduce inflammation<symptom>. It is well known that alkaloids and flavonoids are the main constituents of S. flavescens<pathogen>. However , the clinical researches and applications of S. flavescens<pathogen> is mainly based on its water-extracted alkaloids , its flavonoids may still remain in residues and have been underused. With development and manufacturing of S. flavescens<pathogen> in recent years , more herb residues are being produced. Since they are typically treated as waste and dumped openly in landfill sites , which can cause pollution , there is a great need to explore these wastes as recyclable resources and increase their added value. To date , whether other bioactive components would be found in the residues of S. flavescens<pathogen> is still unknown. If the extraction method of these active ingredients was established , the residues of S. flavescens<pathogen> could be turned from the harm to a benefit and make great sense of the comprehensive utilization of S. flavescens<pathogen> resources. This study aimed to establish an extraction method of the residues of S. flavescens<pathogen> and investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of it both in vivo and in vitro. Dried S. flavescens<pathogen> were decocted with distilled water firstly , then the residues were powdered and extracted with ethyl acetate by using ultrasonic wave. HPLC was utilized to analyze the chemical constituents of the water extracts of S. flavescens<pathogen> ( WSF) and the ethyl acetate extracts of residues of S. flavescens<pathogen> ( RSF). In vivo , the anti-inflammatory effect of WSF and RSF were evaluated using the xylene-induced auricle edema<symptom> , acetic acid-induced peritoneal permeability and carrageenan-induced hind paw edema<symptom> methods. In vitro , the inhibitory activities of WSF and RSF on NO , TNF-Î± , IL-6 and MCP-1 production of LPS-treated RAW264 .7 cells were measured. The major ingredients of RSF were flavonoids , while WSF almost had no flavonoids. In vivo , WSF and RSF ( 200 mg/kg) could significantly inhibit the edema<symptom> in the xylene-induced mice auricle edema<symptom> and carrageenan-induced hind paw edema<symptom> as well as the peritoneal permeability increased by acetic acid. They can also lower production levels of PGE The residues of S. flavescens<pathogen> had obvious flavonoids with anti-inflammatory activity. This study provided evidence for the reuse of residues from S. flavescens<pathogen> in the food additive , medicine and cosmetic industries.
