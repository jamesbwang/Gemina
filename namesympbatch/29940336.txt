  The antiepileptic drug ethosuximide has recently been shown to be neuroprotective in various Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> and rodent neurodegeneration models. It is therefore a promising repurposing candidate for the treatment of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. However , high concentrations of the drug are required for its protective effects in animal models , which may impact on its translational potential and impede the identification of its molecular mechanism of action. Therefore , we set out to develop more potent neuroprotective lead compounds based on ethosuximide as a starting scaffold. Chemoinformatic approaches were used to identify compounds with structural similarity to ethosuximide and to prioritise these based on good predicated blood-brain barrier permeability and C. elegans<pathogen> bioaccumulation properties. Selected compounds were initially screened for anti-convulsant activity in a C. elegans<pathogen> pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure<symptom> assay , as a rapid primary readout of bioactivity; and then assessed for neuroprotective properties in a C. elegans<pathogen> TDP-43 proteinopathy model based on pan-neuronal expression of human A315T mutant TDP-43. The most potent compound screened , α-methyl-α-phenylsuccinimide ( MPS) , ameliorated the locomotion defects and extended the shortened lifespan of TDP-43 mutant worms. MPS also directly protected against neurodegeneration by reducing the number of neuronal breaks and cell body<symptom> losses<symptom> in GFP-labelled GABAergic motor neurons. Importantly , optimal neuroprotection was exhibited by external application of 50 μM MPS , compared to 8 mM for ethosuximide. This greater potency of MPS was not due to bioaccumulation to higher internal levels within the worm , based on
