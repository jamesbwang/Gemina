  To investigate the association between the susceptibility to cervical cancer and the single nucleotide polymorphisms of 5 tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-Î± promoter genes ( rs361525 , rs1800629 , rs1800750 , rs1799964 , and rs673) in Chinese women. A total of 946 peripheral blood samples were collected from women of Han Ethnicity in Shandong province. Of them , 452 were diagnosed with cervical squamous cell carcinomas. The study also included a control group of 494 healthy women. The targeted single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed by TaqMan probe method. ( 1) The rate of high-risk subtype human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> infection in exfoliated cervical epithelial cells was significantly higher in patients with cervical cancer than the control group ( 91.4 % vs 10.3 % , P < .01). The rate of human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> infection was lower in patients with carcinoma in situ than those with invasive carcinoma ( 77.9 % vs 95.4 % , P < .01). ( 2) There was a significant difference for rs361525 genotype ( CC/CT/TT) between the control , carcinoma in situ , and invasive carcinoma groups ( P < .001). Both rs1800629 and rs1799964 genotypes ( both GG/GA/AA) were also different between these groups ( P < .001 and P < .001). ( 3) The allele frequencies of rs361525 , rs1800629 , and rs1799964 were significantly correlated with the diagnosis of cervical cancer. The frequency of T allele in rs361525 was significantly higher for cervical cancer group ( 10.8 %) than control group ( 3.8 %; odds ratio = 3.04 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.76-5.25 , P < .01). The frequency of A allele in rs1800629 was significantly higher for cervical cancer ( 29.9 %) than control group ( 14.2 %; odds ratio = 2.58 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.87-3.56 , P < .01). The frequency of A allele in rs1799964 was also higher for cervical cancer group ( 38.3 %) than control group ( 16.4 %; odds ratio = 1.43 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.07-1.91 , P < .05). The rs361525 , rs1800629 , and rs17999645 were significantly correlated with the diagnosis of cervical cancer.
