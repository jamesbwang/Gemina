  Most herbicides applied in crop field , stay in the soil for a period , affecting next crop or even the plants using as green manure. Nowadays , the use of herbicides grow to increase productivity , mainly in the grain producing region north of Rio Grande do Sul state. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of herbicides fomesafen and sulfentrazone on antioxidant system in Avena sativa1 , Vicia sativa2 , Raphanus sativus and Lupinus albus<pathogen>. The plants were exposed to varying concentrations of fomesafen3 ( 0 , 0.125 , 0.25 and 0.5 kg ha -1) and sulfentrazone ( 0 , 0.3 , 0.6 and 1.2 kg ha-1). For this , the activities of , ascorbat peroxidase , catalase and guaiacol enzymes were analyzed , and the levels of MDA were quantificated. Fomesafen and sulfentrazone promoted alterations in balance<symptom> of plants generating oxidative stress and elicited the response of the antioxidant system of plants , mainly in the high doses of fomesafen , for the species V. sativa and R. sativus. At the same time , the 1,2 kg ha -1 dose of sulfentrazone generated lipid peroxidation for V. sativa , R. sativus and L. albus<pathogen>. Additionally , A. sativa was the species that demonstrated low alterations on antioxidant system with the exposure to herbicide fomesafen and sulfentrazone. Thus , we can we can suggest that the species present a better response in defense of the oxidative stress generated by the herbicides.
