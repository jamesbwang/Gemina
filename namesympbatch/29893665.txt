  The replicase gene of the coronavirus<pathogen> infectious bronchitis<symptom> virus ( IBV) encodes 15 non-structural proteins ( nsps). Nsp 3 is a multi-functional protein containing a conserved ADP-ribose-1 â€³- phosphatase ( ADRP) domain. The crystal structures of the domain from two strains of IBV , M41 ( virulent) and Beaudette ( avirulent) , identified a key difference; M41 contains a conserved triple-glycine motif , whilst Beaudette contains a glycine-to-serine mutation that is predicted to abolish ADRP activity. Although ADRP activity has not been formally demonstrated for IBV nsp 3 , Beaudette fails to bind ADP-ribose. The role of ADRP in virulence was investigated by generating rIBVs , based on Beaudette , containing either a restored triple-glycine motif or the complete M41 ADRP domain. Replication in vitro was unaffected by the ADRP modifications and the in vivo phenotype of the rIBVs was found to be apathogenic , indicating that restoration of the triple-glycine motif is not sufficient to restore virulence to the apathogenic Beaudette strain.
