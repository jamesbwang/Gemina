  The efficient fermentation of xylose can improve biofuel production. We previously developed a two-stage transcriptional reprogramming ( TSTR) strategy ( including a glucose fermentation stage and a xylose fermentation stage) and demonstrated its application for the construction of Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> strains with efficient xylose utilization. In this study , we used these as initial strains to assess the effects of copy number variation ( CNV) on optimal gene expression and rewiring the redox balance<symptom> of the xylose utilization pathway. We obtained strains that contained several integrated copies of XYL1 , XYL2 , and XKS1 and showed increased ethanol yields. An examination of the individual and combined effects of CNVs of key genes and the redox balance<symptom> pathway revealed that the TSTR strategy improves ethanol production efficiency. Furthermore , XYL1 or XYL2 overexpression was related to improved xylose utilization. These results showed that strains with faster growth and/or higher ethanol production produced more ethanol from xylose via the synthetic xylose-assimilation pathway. Accordingly , TSTR is an effective strategy to improve xylose metabolism in industrial yeast strains.
