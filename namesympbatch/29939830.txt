  Substances used as explosives in munitions by the military often result in environmental releases through manufacturing , testing , training , and combat activities. The toxicity of 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one ( nitrotriazolone or NTO) was evaluated following oral exposure in Japanese quail ( Coturnix japonica<pathogen>) to determine if environmental releases result in unacceptable risks to avian populations. In an acute test at the limit dose ( 2000 mg/kg) , one female was ataxic , exhibited tremors<symptom> , and showed signs of neurological toxicity approximately 24 h after dosing. In a subsequent one-generation study , parental generation ( F0) birds were exposed orally to 1000 , 500 , 100 , or 20mg/kg-day NTO suspended in corn oil. After 5 consecutive days of dosing , 2-week-old birds receiving 1000 mg/kg-day displayed ataxia<symptom> , convulsions<symptom> , backward arching of the neck ( opisthotonos) , and alternated between prostrate inactivity and ataxic wing activity. Birds in the 500 mg/kg-day group exhibited neuromuscular anomalies after 17 days exposure. Ultimately , all of the 1000 mg/kg-day birds and all but one of the 500 mg/kg-day birds met euthanasia criteria and were humanely euthanized prior to behavioral and reproductive evaluation. As such , first-generation ( F1) birds were exposed to 100 or 20 mg/kg-day NTO. Mild neuromuscular anomalies occurred in 10 % of F1 birds from the 100 mg/kg-day group , but not in birds from 20 mg/kg-day or controls in either generation. Vacuolization of cerebellum and/or the brainstem was observed on histopathologic examination in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore , brain vacuoles and neuromuscular anomalies were identified as critical endpoints in this study. A mean Benchmark Dose ( BMD) for brain vacuoles of 62 mg/kg-day was derived for male and female F0-generation quail , which corresponded to a Benchmark Dose Low ( BMDL
