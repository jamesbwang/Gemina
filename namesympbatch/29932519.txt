  The aim of this study was to assess maternal misperception rates ( perception as normal or underweight of a child with overweight or obesity) and their role in affecting the chance of implementing actions to change children 's weight. Obesogeneicity of Gadgets<pathogen> Marketed with Snacks ( OBEY-AD) is an international study investigating factors promoting childhood overweight and obesity in 10 countries , in which 2,720 child-mother dyads have been enrolled. Mothers ' perception of their children 's weight was assessed using a projective test. Children 's weight<symptom> status<symptom> was measured according to the anthropometric standards established by the World Health Organization. Mothers classified 89 % of children with overweight and 52 % of children with obesity as normal weight. The odds ratio of mothers ' misperception was significantly higher for higher parental BMI , higher children 's International Brand Awareness Inventory score , and high family socioeconomic status. Children with overweight and/or obesity who were perceived as normal weight by their mothers were less likely to be referred to specific health care services. Most children with overweight and/or obesity were perceived as normal weight by their mothers. Such lack of concern regarding a severe disease might interfere with the effectiveness of prevention programs. Considering the contextual factors that frame the etiological causes of a disease may help in finding effective and enduring solutions to target childhood obesity.
