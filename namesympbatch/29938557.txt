  Depression<symptom> is one the most common mental disorders in prisons. People living with HIV<pathogen> are more likely to develop psychological difficulties when compared with the general population. This study aims to determine the efficacy of cognitive group therapy based on schema-focused approach in reducing depression<symptom> in prisoners living with HIV<pathogen>. The design of this study was between-groups ( or `` independent measures ''). It was conducted with pretest , posttest , and waiting list control group. The research population comprised all prisoners living with HIV<pathogen> in a men 's prison in Iran. Based on voluntary desire , screening , and inclusion criteria , 42 prisoners living with HIV<pathogen> participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to an experimental group ( 21 prisoners) and waiting list control group ( 21 prisoners). The experimental group received 11 sessions of schema-focused cognitive group therapy , while the waiting list control group received the treatment after the completion of the study. The various groups were evaluated in terms of depression<symptom> ANCOVA models were employed to test the study hypotheses. Collated results indicated that depression<symptom> was reduced among prisoners in the experimental group. Schema therapy ( ST) could reduce depression<symptom> among prisoners living with HIV/AIDS.
