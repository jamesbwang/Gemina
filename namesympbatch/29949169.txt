  Inflammation<symptom> and extracellular matrix degradation play a role in cardiac rupture ( CR) after myocardial infarction ( MI). It has been found that the expression of inflammatory cytokine S100A8/A9 was elevated in acute MI patients , whereas its impact in CR after infarction remains unclear. Samples from cardiac tissue and peripheral blood of patients with CR after MI , MI , patients without CR , and healthy control ( cardiotrauma) were collected to test the expressions of S100A8/A9 , p-p65 , and MMP-9. Co-culture system for HCF cells and macrophages were established to identify the impact of hypoxia-ischemia on the expressions of S100A8/A9 and TNFα. S100A9 and/or TNFα blocking agent<pathogen> were applied to examine the effect on macrophages migration , expressions of S100A8 , S100A9 , and TNFα. Western blot was adopted to determine levels of p-p65 and MMP-9 protein after the inhibition of S100A9 and/or TNFα. Compared with healthy control and non-CR patients , serum S100A8/A9 and MMP-9 levels were elevated in cardiac tissues of CR patients , while S100A8/A9 , p-p65 , and MMP-9 were also overexpressed. Hypoxia-ischemia significantly caused the increasing levels of S100A8/A9 and TNFα in macrophages ( p < 0.05). The blockade of S100A9 and/or TNFα suppressed the activation and migration of macrophages. The inhibition of S100A9 expression also decreased the secretion of TNFα in macrophages , while the suppression of TNFα showed no significant impact on S100A8 and S100A9 levels. Downregulation of TNFα or NF-κB markedly declined p-p65 and MMP-9 protein levels in HCF cells from co-culture system or single culture , whereas the blockade of S100A9 only reduced their expressions in co-cultured HCF cells. The level of S100A8/A9 was upregulated in MI patients with CR. S100A8/A9 induced the activation of NF-κB and expression of MMP-9 protein in HCF cells through facilitating secretion of TNFα from macrophages , which may play a role in triggering extracellular matrix degradation and CR.
