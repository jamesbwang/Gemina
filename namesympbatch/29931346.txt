  We describe the natural history of ` Amish ' nemaline myopathy ( ANM) , an infantile-onset , lethal disease linked to a pathogenic c. 505G > T nonsense mutation of TNNT1 , which encodes the slow fiber isoform of troponin T ( TNNT1; a.k.a TnT). The TNNT1 c. 505G > T allele has a carrier frequency of 6.5 % within Old Order Amish settlements of North<pathogen> America. We collected natural history data for 106 ANM patients born between 1923 and 2017. Over the last two decades , mean age of molecular diagnosis was 16 Â± 27 days. TNNT1 c. 505G > T homozygotes were normal weight at birth but failed to thrive by age 9 months. Presenting neonatal signs were axial hypotonia , hip and shoulder stiffness , and tremors<symptom> , followed by progressive<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> , atrophy , and contractures. Affected children developed thoracic rigidity , pectus carinatum , and restrictive lung disease during infancy , and all succumbed to respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> by 6 years of age ( median survival 18 months , range 0.2-66 months). Muscle histology from two affected children showed marked fiber size variation due to both type 1 myofiber smallness ( hypotrophy) and type 2 fiber hypertrophy , with evidence of nemaline rods , myofibrillar disarray , and vacuolar pathology in both fiber types. The truncated slow TNNT1 ( TnT) fragment ( p.Glu180Ter) was undetectable in ANM muscle , reflecting its rapid proteolysis and clearance from sarcoplasm. Similar functional and histological phenotypes were observed in other human cohorts and two transgenic murine models ( Tnnt1-/- and Tnnt1 c. 505G > T). These findings have implications for emerging molecular therapies , including the suitably of TNNT1 gene replacement for newborns with ANM or other TNNT1-associated myopathies.
