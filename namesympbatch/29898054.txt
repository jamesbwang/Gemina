  Describe efficacy and safety of deglutition , nutritional risk , and quality of life in deglutition , and associate nutritional risk with quality of life in individuals with chronic pulmonary disease. The participants were 17 individuals with chronic pulmonary disease evaluated using the following instruments: Volume-Viscosity Swallow<symptom> Test ( V-VST) , Quality of Life in Swallowing Disorders ( SWAL-QOL) questionnaire , Mini<pathogen> Nutritional Assessment ( MNA) , and body mass index ( BMI). Changes in efficacy were observed in nine ( 52.94 %) individuals and impairments in efficacy and safety were found in two ( 11.77 %) individuals. All individuals were considered eutrophic by the nutritional assessment. Correlation was observed between nutritional risk and domains 3 ( r = -0.803; p = 0.05) and 5 ( r = 0.636; p = 0.026) of the SWAL-QOL questionnaire. Changes in efficacy and safety of deglutition were observed; however , no nutritional risk was evidenced in the sample evaluated. Correlation between nutritional risk and quality of life in deglutition was also observed.
