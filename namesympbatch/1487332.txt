  According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics , musculoskeletal disorders ( MSDs) accounted for 32 % of all nonfatal injury and illness cases in 2014 among full-time workers. Our objective was to review and summarize the evidence linking occupational exposures to vibration and awkward posture<symptom> with MSDs of the shoulder and neck. A literature search was conducted using the terms musculoskeletal disorders , vibration , and awkward posture<symptom>. All types<pathogen> of observational epidemiologic studies , with the exception of case reports , published during 1998-2015 were included. Databases searched were MEDLINE ( Ovid) , Embase ( Ovid) , Scopus , Ergonomic Abstracts , NIOSHTIC-2 , and Health and Safety Science Abstracts. Occupational exposures to whole-body or hand-arm vibration were significantly associated with or resulted in MSDs of the shoulder and neck. Awkward postures<symptom> while working were also associated with MSDs in these locations. These findings were consistent across study designs , populations , and countries. Occupational exposure to vibration and awkward posture<symptom> are associated with shoulder and neck MSDs. Longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for these associations , and intervention studies are warranted.
