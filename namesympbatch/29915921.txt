  Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV<pathogen> and optimal maternal treatment are the most important goals of antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women with HIV<pathogen>. These goals may be at risk due to possible reduced exposure during pregnancy caused by physiological<symptom> changes<symptom>. Limited information is available on the impact of these physiological<symptom> changes<symptom>. This is especially true for HIV-integrase inhibitors , a relatively new class of drugs , recommended first-line agents and hence used by a large proportion of HIV-infected patients. Therefore , the objective of this review is to provide a detailed overview of the pharmacokinetics of HIV-integrase inhibitors in pregnancy. Second , this review defines potential causes for the change in pharmacokinetics of HIV-integrase inhibitors during pregnancy. Despite increased clearance , for raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and dolutegravir 50 mg once daily , exposure during pregnancy seems adequate; however , for elvitegravir , the proposed minimal effective concentration is not reached during pregnancy. Lower exposure to these drugs may be caused by increased hormone levels and , subsequently , enhanced drug metabolism during pregnancy. The pharmacokinetics of bictegravir and cabotegravir , which are under development , have not yet been evaluated in pregnant women. New studies need to prospectively assess whether adequate exposure is reached in pregnant women using these new HIV-integrase inhibitors. To further optimize antiretroviral treatment in pregnant women , studies need to unravel the underlying mechanisms behind the changes in the pharmacokinetics of HIV-integrase inhibitors during pregnancy. More knowledge on altered pharmacokinetics during pregnancy and the underlying mechanisms contribute to the development of effective and safe antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected pregnant women.
