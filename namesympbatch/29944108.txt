  Itraconazole ( ITZ) has a broad spectrum of action and is commonly used for the treatment of fungal infections. Topic administration of ITZ is a promising strategy to improve vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment , which can be further optimized by its encapsulation in nanoparticles to increase drug delivery and reduce ITZ toxicity. In this work , we designed polycaprolactone nanoparticles containing ITZ and evaluated in vivo the efficacy of this yet unexplored approach. Nanocapsules ( ITZ-NC) and nanospheres ( ITZ-NS) were obtained by nanoprecipitation. ITZ-NC presented encapsulation efficiency of 99 % , mean diameter of 190 nm , PDI 0.1 and zeta potential of -15 mV. ITZ-NS showed encapsulation efficiency of 97 % , mean diameter of 120 nm , PDI 0.1 and zeta potential of -10 mV. Both particles were efficiently freeze-dried using 10 % trehalose + 10 % sucrose. Nanoparticles were then incorporated in a viscous formulation for vaginal application in female Balb/C mice infected with Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> Fungal load was significantly reduced in infected animals after treatment with ITZ-NC but not with ITZ-NS , compared to animals treated with ITZ solution. Histological analysis showed a clear difference between vaginal tissues of ITZ-NC and ITZ-NS and ITZ solution-treated animals , which correlated with IL-1β and TNF-α quantification. Animals treated with ITZ-NC showed reduced cytokine levels and healthy tissue characteristics , while animals treated with ITZ-NS and ITZ solution showed increased IL-1β and TNF-α levels and typical tissue inflammation<symptom>. Our results demonstrate the potential of ITZ-NC to improve the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis after topical application in the vagina , opening new perspectives for the treatment of this disease.
