  The endoscopic endonasal approach ( EEA) provides direct access to foramen magnum<pathogen> meningiomas; however , it often requires extensive exposure including septal flap elevation with septum removal , complete sphenoidotomy , and panclivectomy.We present a case of a 54-yr-old-female with an incidental foramen magnum<pathogen> lesion<symptom> followed up with serial imaging who presented 10 mo later with progressive neck discomfort and episodes of dizziness<symptom> , with confirmed tumor progression and further brainstem compression. A focal transclival EEA with medial condylectomy was performed preserving the upper two-thirds of the clivus , the nasal septum , and the sphenoid sinus. Gross total removal of a meningioma WHO Grade-1 was achieved with dura resection on the majority of the tumor ( Simpson 2). Closure was achieved with a random pedicled inverted V nasaopharyngeal flap. There were no complications , all symptoms improved , and no recurrence was seen in 12 mo of follow-up. IRB approval was neither required nor saught for this single case report. The patient gave informed consent.
