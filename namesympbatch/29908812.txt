  In Switzerland , sanitation programs of dairy herds infected with the contagious mastitis<symptom> pathogen Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> genotype B ( GTB) have been established for several years. In recent years , Streptococcus<pathogen> uberis and non-aureus staphylococci have emerged as the bacteria most frequently isolated from bovine milk samples. The latter cause subclinical mastitis<symptom> , and some species are more persistent or pathogenic than others. The present study aimed to investigate the developments in the intramammary colonization spectrum of 5 dairy herds undergoing a sanitation program for Staph. aureus<pathogen> GTB. We collected single-quarter milk samples aseptically from all lactating cows at 3-mo intervals during the sanitation period; after classical bacteriological analysis , MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to identify the isolates to the species level. Non-aureus staphylococci were found to be the bacterial group most frequently occurring on the selected farms , with Staphylococcus<pathogen> chromogenes and Staphylococcus<pathogen> xylosus<pathogen> being predominant. The present study demonstrated that GTB-infected cows treated with antibiotics lacked systematic recolonization with other bacteria during herd sanitation for the contagious Staph. aureus<pathogen> GTB.
