  Glycogen is synthesized and stored to maintain postprandial blood glucose homeostasis and to ensure an uninterrupted energy supply between meals. Although the regulation of glycogen turnover has been well studied , the effects of glycogen on aging and disease development have been largely unexplored. In Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> fed a high sugar diet , glycogen potentiates resistance to oxidants , but paradoxically , shortens lifespan. Depletion of glycogen by oxidants or inhibition of glycogen synthesis extends the lifespan of worms by an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Thus , glycogen is not merely an inert storage molecule , but also an active regulator of energy balance<symptom> and aging. Its depletion by oxidants may be beneficial in the treatment of hyperglycemia and glycogen-related diseases.
