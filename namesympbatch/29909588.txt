  A growing population of youth who acquired HIV<pathogen> from their mothers are surviving into adulthood. This group is unique in that they experience both internalized stigma ( due to their HIV<pathogen> status) and associative stigma ( due to their mothers ' HIV<pathogen> status). Results of a cross-sectional survey of 250 perinatally HIV-infected South African youth suggests that internalized stigma is associated with greater risk of depression<symptom> , and associative stigma is associated with greater risk of depression<symptom> and substance use problems. Interventions currently focus on internalized stigma; this study highlights the importance of also addressing associative stigma to improve outcomes among perinatally HIV-infected youth.
