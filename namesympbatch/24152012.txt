  The European beech is arguably the most important climax broad-leaved tree species in Central Europe , widely planted for its valuable wood. Here , we report the 542 Mb draft genome sequence of an up to 300-year-old individual ( Bhaga) from an undisturbed stand<symptom> in the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park in central Germany. Using a hybrid assembly approach , Illumina reads with short- and long-insert libraries , coupled with long Pacific Biosciences reads , we obtained an assembled genome size of 542 Mb , in line with flow cytometric genome size estimation. The largest scaffold was of 1.15 Mb , the N50 length was 145 kb , and the L50 count was 983. The assembly contained 0.12 % of Ns. A Benchmarking with Universal Single-Copy Orthologs ( BUSCO) analysis retrieved 94 % complete BUSCO genes , well in the range of other high-quality draft genomes of trees. A total of 62,012 protein-coding genes were predicted , assisted by transcriptome sequencing. In addition , we are reporting an efficient method for extracting high-molecular-weight DNA from dormant buds , by which contamination by environmental bacteria and fungi<pathogen> was kept at a minimum. The assembled genome will be a valuable resource and reference for future population genomics studies on the evolution and past climate change adaptation of beech and will be helpful for identifying genes , e.g. , involved in drought tolerance , in order to select and breed individuals to adapt forestry to climate change in Europe. A continuously updated genome browser and download page can be accessed from beechgenome.net , which will include future genome versions of the reference individual Bhaga , as new sequencing approaches develop.
