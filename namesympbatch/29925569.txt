  In many bacteria , ribosomal proteins autogenously repress their own expression by interacting with RNA structures typically located in the 5 '- UTRs of their mRNA transcripts. This regulation is necessary to maintain a balance<symptom> between ribosomal proteins and rRNA to ensure proper ribosome production. Despite advances in non-coding RNA discovery and validation of RNA-protein regulatory interactions , the selective pressures that govern the formation and maintenance of such RNA cis-regulators in the context of an organism remain largely undetermined. To examine the impact disruptions to this regulation have on bacterial fitness , we introduced point mutations that abolish ribosomal protein binding and regulation into the RNA structure that controls expression of ribosomal proteins L20 and L35 within the Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> genome. Our studies indicate that removing this regulation results in reduced log phase growth , improper rRNA maturation , and the accumulation of a kinetically trapped or mis-assembled ribosomal particle at low temperatures , suggesting defects in ribosome synthesis. Such work emphasizes the important role regulatory RNAs play in the stoichiometric production of ribosomal components for proper ribosome composition and overall organism viability and reinforces the potential of targeting ribosomal protein production and ribosome assembly with novel antimicrobials.
