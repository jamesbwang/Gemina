  Antithrombotic treatment regimen following transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) is not evidence-based. Apixaban , a non-vitamin K direct anticoagulant ( NOAC) was shown to be superior to VKA and superior to aspirin to prevent cardioembolic stroke in non-valvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. It may have the potential to reduce TAVR-related thrombotic complications including subclinical valve thrombosis along with a better safety than the standard of care. ATLANTIS is a multicenter , randomized , phase IIIb<pathogen> , prospective , open-label , superiority study comparing standard of care ( SOC Group) versus an apixaban-based strategy ( Anti-Xa Group) after successful TAVR ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 02664649). Randomization is stratified according to the need for chronic anticoagulation therapy for a reason other than the TAVR procedure. In the experimental arm , patients receive 5 mg bid of apixaban or a reduced dose of 2.5 mg bid according to the drug label or when apixaban is combined with antiplatelet therapy. In the control arm , patients receive VKA therapy if there is an indication for oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy alone ( single or dual) or the combination of both if needed. The primary study end point is the composite of all-cause death , TIA/stroke , myocardial infarction , symptomatic valve thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , deep venous thrombosis , systemic embolism , life-threatening , disabling or major bleeding , according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium definitions. ATLANTIS tests the superiority of an apixaban-based strategy versus the recommended standard of care strategy to reduce the risk of post-TAVR thromboembolic and bleeding complications in an all comer population.
