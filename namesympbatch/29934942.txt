  Acne vulgaris<pathogen> is the most common skin disorder and contributes an estimated 0.29 % of the global burden of disease. The pathophysiology of acne involves excess sebum production and altered lipid composition by the sebaceous glands , follicular hyperkeratinization , bacterial colonization by Cutibacterium<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> ( C.<pathogen> acnes<pathogen>) , and perifollicular inflammation<symptom>. 13-cis Retinoic Acid ( 13-cis RA) , also known as isotretinoin , is the only acne therapy that targets all four pathologic mechanisms and is often prescribed to patients with severe acne.
