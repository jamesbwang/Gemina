  Tinnitus<symptom> is one of the complex<pathogen> symptoms of hearing described as a phantom auditory sensation without any external stimulation. Due to the subjective nature of tinnitus<symptom> , perception and discomfort of tinnitus<symptom> vary among the patients. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effects of gender , age and the degree of hearing loss on discomfort due to tinnitus<symptom>. Eighteen patients with tinnitus<symptom> , aged 21-72 years , ( 9 males and 9 females) were recruited. Tinnitus<symptom> discomfort<symptom> was investigated by Tinnitus<symptom> Handicap Inventory ( THI) questionnaire. Psychoacoustic assessments of tinnitus<symptom> and auditory threshold assessments were evaluated using a 2-channel clinical audiometer. The results showed no significant correlation between THI scores with loudness matching ( P = 0.187) , mean of auditory threshold ( P = 0.304) , gender ( P = 0.93) and age ( P = 0.200). Also , no significant correlation was found between maximal level of hearing loss and pitch matching ( P = 0.208). The study findings suggests that tinnitus<symptom> is not correlated with age , gender and hearing loss. Overall , tinnitus<symptom> is a complicated clinical condition which its real impact and degree of discomfort are unclear. More investigation is needed to clarify the factors involving in tinnitus<symptom> annoyance.
