  To describe patients with refractory cardiogenic shock<symptom> related to influenza<disease> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> myocarditis<disease> rescued by venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( VA-ECMO). Consecutive patients hospitalized in our unit for influenza-associated myocarditis<disease> were prospectively included. We also conducted a systematic MEDLINE database literature review through the PubMed search engine , between 1946 and 2017. We report the cases of 4 young patients with fulminant myocarditis<disease> requiring VA-ECMO for 6 ( 5-8) days. Influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> was detected in all patients , either in nasopharyngeal sampling or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The 4 patients received oseltamivir. Heart function recovery allowed ECMO device removal without cardiac sequelae in all 4 patients. Systematic review retrieved 184 cases of influenza-associated myocarditis<disease> , most cases associated with H1N1<pathogen> type-A infection during the 2009 pandemic. Forty eight cases of influenza<disease> myocarditis-associated cardiogenic shock<symptom> requiring mechanical circulatory support including 3 cases due to influenza<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> were described. Mean duration of mechanical circulatory support was 8.5 Â± 6 days and mortality rate was 33 %. Influenza<disease> myocarditis<disease> is a rare but reversible cause of cardiogenic shock<symptom> amenable to VA-ECMO rescue. Early antiviral therapy and ECMO support should be considered for patients with fulminant myocarditis<disease> during an influenza<disease> epidemic.
