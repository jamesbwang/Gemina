  A case of toxic shock<symptom> syndrome<disease> associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> parotitis in a 13-year-old male is presented. He was initially diagnosed with left-sided parotitis by his primary care physician , was started on sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim , and became severely ill the following day. He was transported to the hospital after a syncopal episode at home and was found to have altered mental<symptom> status<symptom> , hypotension<symptom> , and hypoxia. He was transferred to a larger care facility and died en route despite aggressive resuscitation. At autopsy , he was found to have a severe left-sided parotitis , severe<symptom> pulmonary<symptom> congestion<symptom> , edema<symptom> , and pneumonia<disease> , as well as bilateral lower limb<symptom> hemorrhagic lesions<symptom>. Blood cultures from the time of admission and at autopsy grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , which is rarely reported as the sole cause of parotitis. In addition , although S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> bacteremia is not necessarily a rare complication of a parotid<symptom> gland infection , it is exceedingly rare in an immunocompetent adolescent.
