  One of the most important zoonotic pathogens worldwide , Streptococcus<pathogen> suis<pathogen> is a swine pathogen that is responsible for meningitis<disease> , toxic shock<symptom> and even death in humans. S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> infection develops rapidly with nonspecific clinical symptoms in the early stages and a high fatality rate. Recently , much attention has been paid to the high prevalence of S suis as well as the increasing incidence and its epidemic characteristics. As laboratory-acquired infections of S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> can occur and it is dangerous to public health security , timely and early diagnosis has become key to controlling S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> prevalence. Here , the techniques that have been used for the detection , typing and characterization of S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> are reviewed and the prospects for future detection methods for this bacterium<pathogen> are also discussed.
