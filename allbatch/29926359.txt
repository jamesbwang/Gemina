  We experienced a breakthrough fungal infection caused by Geotrichum<pathogen> capitatum during empirical therapy with caspofungin. A 68-year-old male patient with refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> had received umbilical cord blood transplantation after two courses of induction therapy. Empirical therapy with caspofungin was initiated 5 days before transplantation. Tacrolimus was continuously infused to prevent graft-versus-host disease. A minidose of methotrexate was intravenously administered on days 1 and 3 post-transplantation , which was changed to prednisolone from day 7 due to severe mucositis. During a recurrence of fever<disease> on day 11 , blood cultures were found to be positive for a yeast-like organism , which was later confirmed by mass spectrometry to be G. capitatum. The serum levels of beta-D-glucan were elevated to 747 pg/mL. Caspofungin was switched to liposomal amphotericin B; however , radiological findings revealed pulmonary , splenic , and central nervous system involvement. Progressive renal and hepatic dysfunction subsequently developed. The patient died on day 25 post-transplantation secondary to the development of hemophagocytic syndrome<disease> and respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>. We emphasize that recurrent febrile episodes , prolonged neutropenia , and underlying gastrointestinal mucosal damage require extreme caution due to the possibility of breakthrough infection caused by new fungal pathogens during empirical therapy with caspofungin.
