  Atrophic gastritis<disease> caused by chronic inflammation<symptom> in the gastric mucosa leads to the loss of gastric glandular cells , including acid-secreting parietal cells. Parietal cell atrophy in a setting of chronic inflammation<symptom> induces spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia , a critical step in gastric carcinogenesis. However , the mechanisms by which inflammation<symptom> causes parietal cell atrophy and spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia are not well defined. We investigated the role of interleukin-17A ( IL-17A) in causing parietal cell atrophy. A mouse model of autoimmune atrophic gastritis<disease> was used to examine IL-17A production during early and late stages of disease. Organoids derived from corpus glands were used to determine the direct effects of IL-17A on gastric epithelial cells. Immunofluorescent staining was used to examine IL-17A receptors and the direct effect of signaling on parietal cells. Mice were infected with an IL-17A-producing adenovirus<pathogen> to determine the effects of IL-17A on parietal cells in vivo. Finally , IL-17A neutralizing antibodies were administered to mice with active atrophic gastritis<disease> to evaluate the effects on parietal cell atrophy and metaplasia. Increased IL-17A correlated with disease severity in mice with chronic atrophic gastritis<disease> IL-17A caused caspase-dependent gastric organoid degeneration , which could not be rescued with a necroptosis inhibitor. Parietal cells expressed IL-17A receptors and IL-17A treatment induced apoptosis in parietal cells. Overexpressing IL-17A in vivo induced caspase-3 activation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling staining in parietal cells. Finally , IL-17A neutralizing antibody decreased parietal cell atrophy and metaplasia in mice with chronic atrophic gastritis<disease> These data identify IL-17A as a cytokine that promotes parietal cell apoptosis during atrophic gastritis<disease> , a precursor lesion<symptom> for gastric cancer.
