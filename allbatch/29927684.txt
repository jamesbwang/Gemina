  Periodontal<disease> disease<disease> ( PD) afflicts 46 % of Americans with no effective adjunctive therapies available. While most pharmacotherapy for PD targets bacteria , the host immune response is responsible for driving tissue damage and bone loss in severe disease. Herein , we establish that the histone demethylase KDM4B is a potential drug target for the treatment of PD. Immunohistochemical staining of diseased periodontal epithelium revealed an increased abundance of KDM4B that correlates with inflammation<symptom>. In murine calvarial sections exposed to Aggregatibacter<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> lipopolysaccharide ( Aa-LPS) , immunohistochemical staining revealed a significant increase in KDM4B protein expression. The 8-hydroxyquinoline ML324 is known to inhibit the related demethylase KDM4E in vitro , but has not been evaluated against any other targets. Our studies indicate that ML324 also inhibits KDM4B ( IC
