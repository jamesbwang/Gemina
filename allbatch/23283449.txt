  The Clinical Trial for Uniform Multidrug Therapy for Leprosy<disease> Patients in Brazil ( U-MDT/CT-BR) , designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a six-months regimen , assessed the adverse effects caused by the drugs. Describe adverse effects due to MDT in U-MDT/CT-BR , comparing the uniform regimen ( U-MDT) to the current WHO regimen ( R-MDT). After operational classification , patients were randomly allocated to the study groups. U-MDT PB and U-MDT MB groups , received the U-MDT regimen , six doses of MB-MDT ( rifampicin , dapsone and clofazimine). R-MDT PB and R-MDT MB groups , received the WHO regimens: six doses ( rifampicin and dapsone) for PB and 12 doses ( rifampicin , dapsone and clofazimine) for MB. During treatment , patients returned monthly for clinical and laboratorial evaluation. Patients with single lesion<symptom> were not included in this trial. Skin pigmentation ( 21.7 %) and xerosis<pathogen> ( 16.9 %) were the most frequent complaints among 753 patients. Laboratory exams showed hemoglobin concentration lower than 10g/dL in 23.3 % of the patients , glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( GOT) above 40U/L in 29.5 % and glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( GPT) above 40U/L in 28.5 %. Twenty-four patients ( 3.2 %) stopped dapsone intake due to adverse effects , of whom 16.6 % due to severe anemia<symptom> One case of sulfone syndrome<disease> was reported. Loss of some monthly laboratory sample collection. There was no statistical difference regarding adverse effects in the R-MDT and U-MDT groups but anemia<symptom> was greater in patients from R-MDT/MB group , therefore adverse effects do not represent a constraint to recommend the six-month uniform regimen of treatment for all leprosy<disease> patients.
