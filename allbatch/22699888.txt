  BACKGROUND Whereas non-tuberculous mycobacterium<disease> ( NTM) pulmonary disease can mimic lung cancer as a solitary pulmonary nodule<disease> or mass , the coexistence of lung cancer and NTM pulmonary disease in a single nodule<disease> or mass is rare. We report such a rare case , highlighting that during a bronchoscopes examination which comprises taking a transbronchial lung biopsy ( TBLB) , bronchial brushing , and bronchial lavage , a positive mycobacterium<disease> culture result for sputum<symptom> or bronchial lavage fluid does not exclude the possibility of a concomitant lung cancer. CASE REPORT An 87-year-old male was referred to our institution for evaluation of an abnormal shadow on a chest x-ray scan. He had been previously healthy with no symptoms and an unremarkable medical history. A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed a cavitating mass measuring 20 Ã— 40 mm with a thick ring-enhancing irregular wall in the left lower lobe. Although the TBLB of the lesion<symptom> showed no malignant cells , sputum<symptom> acid-fast bacilli smear and culture of the bronchial lavage fluid yielded positive results. An NTM infection , instead of lung cancer was suspected to have caused the mass because a Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> polymerase chain reaction showed negative results. However , we performed the surgery because NTM pulmonary disease and lung cancer can not be differentiated. The results of a pathological examination of the mass showed an adenocarcinoma , and M.<pathogen> avium<disease> complex<disease> was detected in the cancer tissue culture. CONCLUSIONS Physicians should suspect the co-existent lung cancer and NTM infection in patients with solitary lung masses that yield a positive mycobacterium<disease> culture result for sputum<symptom> or bronchial lavage fluid.
