  High-resolution anoscopy ( HRA) is a potential screening method for detection of anal cancer precursors. We evaluated factors associated with adherence to recommended HRA follow-up time intervals among men who have sex with men ( MSM). We employed a retrospective , observational cohort study with 155 MSM screened by HRA between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2016 at a Federally Qualified Health Centre in Boston , Massachusetts. The sample was 80 % white , with a median age of 48 ( non-normal distribution , IQR 15). All patients were assigned male sex at birth and none identified as transgender. Fifty patients ( 32 %) followed up with a HRA appointment within 6 months of previous HRA detection of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion<symptom> ( HSIL). Among patients , 112 ( 72 %) were HIV<pathogen> infected , 56 ( 36 %) had a syphilis<disease> diagnosis during the study period , 89 ( 57.4 %) had initiated Hepatitis<disease> A or B vaccination series , 70 ( 45.2 %) accessed case management services and 19 ( 12.3 %) utilised pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP). In bivariate analysis , patients who underwent recommended follow-up HRA within 6 months of HSIL diagnosis were less likely to report: case management utilisation ( p = 0.023) , initiation of Hepatitis<disease> A<disease> or B vaccination ( p = 0.047) , HIV<pathogen> diagnosis ( p < 0.001) and syphilis<disease> diagnosis ( p = 0.001) , but were more likely to use HIV<pathogen> PrEP ( p < 0.001). In binomial logistic regression modelling after adjusting for age and race/ethnicity , patients who had follow-up with HRA within a recommended period of 6 months after HSIL diagnosis were less likely to have initiated Hepatitis<disease> A<disease> or B vaccination ( adjusted OR 0.43 , 95 % CI 0.20 to 0.94) , more likely to use PrEP ( adjusted OR 4.47 , 95 % CI 1.30 to 15.49) and less likely to have a syphilis<disease> diagnosis ( adjusted OR 0.34 , 95 % CI 0.14 to 0.86). Three-quarters of patients with HSIL did not have follow-up HRA within the clinic 's recommended follow-up period of 6 months following HSIL diagnosis by HRA. Future studies ought to explore whether addressing anal health during other STI-related care helps improve adherence to recommended time intervals for follow-up HRA. Given the high prevalence of STI and PrEP use , studies might also evaluate whether integrating HRA follow-up with other sexual health screenings helps improve adherence to recommended HRA follow-up.
