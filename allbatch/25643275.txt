  Melioidosis<disease> is an emerging infectious<disease> disease<disease> caused by Burkholderia<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> To our knowledge , there have been very few cases of splenic abscesses<disease> due to melioidosis<disease> in Hainan , China. The patient was a 55-year-old male farmer , who was admitted in our hospital with persistent left epigastric dull pain accompanied by chills<symptom> and febrile. One month before , the patient presented with persistent abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> After received anti-infection therapy , the subjective symptoms eased slightly , but recently he suffered from intermittent abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> again. Bacteria isolated from splenic pus were identified as B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> by the Phoenix-100 system and indirect immunofluorescence. The patient was treated by surgical excision and anti-infection therapy. The patient was then treated with intravenous ceftazidime and oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 2 weeks and his clinical symptoms improved. In endemic areas , B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> should be considered as a causative organism of splenic abscess<disease> in patients with established risk factors. The isolation of B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> from abscess<disease> sites is crucial to improve clinical outcomes by appropriate antimicrobial therapy coupled with surgical drainage.
