  The ancient infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , Lemierre 's Syndrome<disease> and Bezold 's Abscesses<disease> are rare. A 70-year-old Japanese woman with a 15-year history of Parkinson 's disease was referred to our hospital due to fever<disease> , occipital headache<symptom> and bilateral shoulder pain that had continued for three months. She had been prescribed prednisolone due to a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. A blood culture revealed bacteremia of Streptococcus<pathogen> constellatus<pathogen>. In addition , computed tomography revealed Bezold 's abscesses<disease> and Lemierre 's syndrome<disease>. We administered ceftriaxone for 31 days , followed by oral amoxicillin. The patient recovered and the abscesses<disease> improved. This case underscores the importance of blood culture tests and cross-referencing with radiological imagings in the diagnoses of these rare critical infectious<disease> diseases<disease> that mimic polymyalgia rheumatica.
