  Gastritis<disease> is a widely spread inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> , mostly caused by Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection. Release of IL-8 by the stomach epithelium is a hallmark of gastritis<disease> and contributes to the amplification of the inflammatory state. Pharmacological modulation of IL-8 release is a strategy to relieve gastric inflammation<symptom> and prevent more severe clinical outcomes. In search of nutraceuticals with potential anti-gastritis properties we used a bio-guided approach based on IL-8 secretion by gastric cells to characterize extracts from the fruits of different chestnut varieties. We found that the ability to inhibit IL-8 secretion correlated with the amount of proanthocyanidins and was associated to the not edible parts of chestnut in all the tested varieties. We also found that the anti-inflammatory activity is preserved upon mild thermal treatment and after in vitro simulated gastric digestion. By combining a robust bio-guided approach with a comprehensive analysis of the tannin fraction of chestnut extracts , we provide evidence for the potential use of chestnut-based nutraceuticals in human gastritis<disease> The bioactive components of chestnut fruits inhibit IL-8 secretion by impairing NF-ÎºB signaling and by other mechanisms , thus opening new applications of proanthocyanidins for inflammation-based diseases.
