  Malaria<disease> in pregnancy ( MiP) is one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity in tropical regions , causing maternal anemia<symptom> , intrauterine growth retardation , preterm birth , and low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( LBW). The integration of the information systems on pregnancy and malaria<disease> could prove to be a useful method of improved decision making for better maternal-child health. A population-based observational study acquired information retrospectively from all live births that occurred between 2006 and 2014 in Cruzeiro do Sul ( Acre , Brazil). Social and clinical data of the mother and newborn was extracted from the Information System of Live Births. Malaria<disease> episodes information was obtained from the Brazilian Epidemiological Surveillance Information System Malaria. A deterministic record linkage was performed to assess malaria<disease> impact on pregnancy. The studied population presented a malaria<disease> incidence of 8.9 % ( 1283 pregnant women infected) , of which 63.9 % infected by Plasmodium<pathogen> ( P.) vivax<disease>. Reduction of newborn birth weight at term ( small for gestational age ( SGA) and LBW) has been found associated with P.<pathogen> vivax<disease> infection during pregnancy ( SGA-OR 1.24 , 95 % CI 1.02-1.52 , p = 0.035; term LBW-OR 1.39 , 95 % CI 1.03-1.88 , p = 0.033). Additionally , P.<pathogen> falciparum<disease> infection during pregnancy has been found to be associated with preterm births ( OR 1.54 , 95 % CI 1.09-2.18 , p = 0.016) , which is related with late preterm births ( OR 1.59 , 95 % CI 1.11-2.27 , p = 0.011). Despite the decrease of malaria<disease> cases during the evaluation period and regardless of Plasmodium<pathogen> species , we present evidence of the deleterious effects of MiP in a low transmission area in the Amazonian region.
