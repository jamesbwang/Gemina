  Group A streptococcus<pathogen> ( GAS) is responsible for mild to very severe disease. The epidemiology of an upsurge in invasive GAS ( iGAS) infections in Ireland , 2012-2015 was investigated. Epidemiological typing of iGAS ( n = 473) isolates was performed and compared to non-invasive ( n = 517) isolates. Clinical data of notified iGAS was obtained from the national infectious<disease> disease<disease> information system. Annual incidences of iGAS cases ( n = 561) were 2.33-3.66 per 100,000 population. Bacteraemia<disease> was the most common clinical presentation ( 75 %) followed by focus without bacteraemia<disease> ( 19 %) and necrotizing faciitis ( 7 %). Streptococcal toxic shock<symptom> syndrome<disease> occurred in 19 % of presentations. The main invasive emm types in rank order were emm1 , emm3 , emm28 , emm12 and emm89 whereas emm4 , emm28 , emm3 , emm12 , emm89 and emm1 predominated in non-invasive infections. Invasive emm1 and emm3 showed annual fluctuations ( 15-48 % and 4-37 % , respectively) and predominated in most clinical presentations of iGAS. Superantigens speA , speG , speJ was associated with iGAS disease and , speC , speI and ssa with non-invasive infections. There was 4.3 % erythromycin and 5.6 % tetracycline resistance. The main resistant types were emm11 , emm28 and emm77. Cyclic increases in emm1 and emm3 occurred during the iGAS upsurge. Continued surveillance of GAS is therefore essential given the epidemiological changes that occur in a short time period.
