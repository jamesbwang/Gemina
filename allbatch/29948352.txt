  Psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( PsA) may affect different joints , including the spine. The prevalence of spinal involvement is variable depending on the definition and a subset of patients have been identified in cohorts that do not have clinical features of axial disease and yet have imaging findings. Still , there is not a consensus on how and when to screen axial disease. In this study , we aimed to investigate factors associated with being underdiagnosed for axial psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( axPsA) and its impacts on outcomes. Disease features and outcomes of axPsA according to the physician ( n = 415) were compared with patients with imaging findings only ( sacroiliitis fulfilling the modified New<pathogen> York criteria , n = 112) , using data from a real-life PsA registry. Patients with imaging findings only were more frequently women ( 83/220 ( 37.7 %) vs 29/122 ( 23.8 %); p = 0.008). This group also had higher peripheral disease activity ( imaging only vs clinical AxPsA: mean ( SD) tender joint count 5.3 ( 6.1) vs 3.3 ( 4.7) , swollen joint count 1.9 ( 2.9) vs 1.2 ( 2.4); p < 0.001 for both comparisons) and was less often treated using TNF inhibitors ( 16.1 vs 38.2 %; p < 0.001) than patients who were classified as axPsA. Patient-reported outcomes were similar in both groups. PsA patients , especially women with more severe peripheral disease , have a higher risk of being underdiagnosed for axPsA. The severity of peripheral<symptom> symptoms<symptom> may be a risk factor to mask the spinal features of PsA.
