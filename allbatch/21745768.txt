  Saint Louis<disease> encephalitis<disease> virus<pathogen> ( SLEV) is a neglected flavivirus<pathogen> that causes severe neurological disorders. The epidemic strain of SLEV , CbaAr-4005 , isolated during an outbreak in CÃ³rdoba city ( Argentina) , causes meningitis<disease> and encephalitis<disease> associated with neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in a murine experimental model. Here , we identified the affected brain areas and the damage triggered by this neurotropic arbovirus. We performed a detailed analysis of brain neurodegeneration associated with CbaAr-4005 SLEV infection in mice. The motor cortex , corpus striatum<pathogen> and cerebellum were the most affected structures. Neurodegeneration was also found in the olfactory bulb , thalamus , hypothalamus , hippocampus , and hindbrain. SLEV infection triggered brain cell apoptosis as well as somatodendritic and terminal degeneration. In addition , we observed massive excitotoxic-like degeneration in many cortical structures. Apoptosis was also detected in the neuroblastoma cell line N2a cultured with SLEV. The results evidenced that SLEV CbaAr-4005 infection induced severe degenerative alterations within the central nervous system of infected mice , providing new information about the targets of this flavivirus<pathogen> infection.
