  Recently , an immunodeficiency<disease> syndrome<disease> caused by guanine-adenine-thymine-adenine 2 ( GATA2) deficiency has been described. The syndrome<disease> is characterized by ( i) typical onset in early adulthood , ( ii) profound peripheral blood cytopenias<symptom> of monocytes , B lymphocytes , and NK cells , ( iii) distinct susceptibility to disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacterial ( NTM) and other opportunistic infections ( particularly human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> , and ( iv) a high risk of developing hematologic malignancies ( myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS); acute myeloid leukemias<disease> ( AML)). Considerable clinical heterogeneity exists among patients with GATA2 deficiency , but once infectious symptoms occur or MDS/AML arises , survival declines significantly. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) currently provides the only curative treatment option for both MDS/AML and dysfunctional immunity with life-threatening opportunistic infections. Strategies regarding timing of allogeneic HCT , antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment , intensity of the preparative regimen , and optimal donor and graft source have not been clearly defined due to the rarity of the disease. Here , we provide a comprehensive analysis of the available literature and published case reports on the use of allogeneic HCT in patients with GATA2 deficiency. In addition , a case of a young woman with GATA2 deficiency , who developed an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome<disease> in her mycobacterial skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> post allogeneic HCT is presented and illustrates distinct problems encountered in this disease context.
