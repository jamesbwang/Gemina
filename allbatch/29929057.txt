  In Aggregatibacter<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> , different serotypes have been described based on LPS antigenicity. Mixed<disease> infection<disease> with the different A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> serotypes is frequent in periodontitis<disease> patients; accordingly , the role of this bacterial species in the pathogenesis of periodontitis<disease> may differ depending whether patients or periodontal lesions<symptom> harbour one or more of the A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> serotypes. We hypothesized that different combinations of these serotypes could be associated with distinct host responses and hence different inflammatory patterns. This investigation was aimed to assess whether the increased immuno-stimulatory potential attributed to the serotype b of A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> on immune cells is able to be modified during co-infection with other A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> serotypes. Dendritic cells ( DCs) were obtained from healthy subjects and stimulated with the different A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> serotypes or their purified LPS using the following stimulatory conditions: serotype a , b , or c , and the combinations a + b , a + c , b + c , or a + b + c. The cytokine , CCR , and CCL levels were quantified by qPCR and ELISA. Higher levels of cytokines , CCRs , and CCLs were induced when DCs were stimulated with the serotype b of A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> compared with the same cells stimulated with the other serotypes. When DCs were co-infected , these levels decreased in comparison with the serotype b-stimulation alone , in particular when the serotype a was present in the mixed<disease> infection<disease>. The increased immuno-stimulatory potential attributed to the serotype b was modified when DCs were co-infected with other A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> serotypes , in particular , when the serotype a was present , the DC response diminished.
