  Vitamin D plays an important role in the immune response against infection. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of vitamin D deficiency on the progression of otitis<disease> media<disease> ( OM) using an experimental rat model. Four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats ( n = 72) were divided into two groups based on their diet: a control diet group ( n = 36) and a vitamin D-deficient diet group ( n = 36). After 8 weeks of diet , experimental OM was induced by inoculation of non-typeable Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen> in the middle ear cavity. The rats were evaluated with otomicroscopy to determine the inflammation<symptom> in the middle ear mucosa on days 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , and 14 post-inoculation. Bullae from sacrificed rats were collected and analyzed histologically. The middle ear mucosa from rats with vitamin D deficiency showed a significantly higher thickness than that of controls during the course of OM. The maximum mucosal thickness was 56.0 ± 9.1 μm in the vitamin D deficiency group , and 43.9 ± 9.8 μm in the control group , although there was no significant difference in the tympanic membrane score between the two groups evaluated with otomicroscopy. An immunohistochemical study showed increased expression of interleukin 6 ( IL-6) and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α in rats manifesting vitamin D deficiency and decreased expression of IL-10 compared with controls. Our results showed that vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate the pathophysiological changes of OM via altered cytokine production. Therefore , maintaining vitamin D status in the optimal range may be beneficial for proper management of OM.
