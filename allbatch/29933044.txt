  Little is known about the impact of viral<disease> infections<disease> on lung matrix despite its important contribution to mechanical stability and structural support. The composition of matrix also indirectly controls inflammation<symptom> by influencing cell adhesion , migration , survival , proliferation and differentiation. Hyaluronan is a significant component of the lung extracellular matrix and production and degradation must be carefully balanced. We have discovered an imbalance in hyaluronan production following resolution of a severe lung influenza<disease> virus<pathogen> infection , driven by hyaluronan synthase 2 from epithelial cells , endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Furthermore hyaluronan is complexed with inter-α-inhibitor heavy chains due to elevated TNF-stimulated gene 6 expression and sequesters CD44-expressing macrophages. We show that intranasal administration of exogenous hyaluronidase is sufficient to release inter-α-inhibitor heavy chains , reduce lung hyaluronan content and restore lung function. Hyaluronidase is already used to facilitate dispersion of co-injected materials in the clinic. It is therefore feasible that fibrotic changes following severe lung<disease> infection<disease> and inflammation<symptom> could be overcome by targeting abnormal matrix production.
