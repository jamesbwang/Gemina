  Although most esophageal non-epithelial tumors are benign tumors , such as leiomyomas , they also include gastrointestinal tumors ( GISTs); thus , a histopathological diagnosis is indispensable to determine the optimal treatment strategy. However , no consensus has been reached as to the diagnostic methods and treatments for esophageal non-epithelial tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the diagnostic methods and treatments for esophageal non-epithelial tumors in our hospital. All 28 cases of esophageal non-epithelial tumors at Kobe University Hospital from 2008 to 2016 were analyzed retrospectively with respect to the diagnostic methods , histopathological diagnosis , and treatments. Three diagnostic methods , endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA) , endoscopic incisional biopsy , and endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD)/ endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR) , were performed in our hospital. All GIST cases could be correctly diagnosed by EUS-FNA. Tumors less than approximately 20 mm in diameter and located in the superficial layer are good indications for ESD/EMR , which both play roles in diagnosis and treatment. The final diagnoses by these methods consisted of the following: 13 leiomyomas , 5 GISTs , 3 schwannomas , 2 liposarcomas , 3 cysts<symptom> , 1 reactive lymphoid hyperplasia<disease> , and 1 granulosa<pathogen> cell tumor. Fifteen cases underwent surgery. Enucleation or partial resection was performed for leiomyomas , schwannomas and liposarcomas , while esophagectomy was performed for GISTs. Thus , sufficient management of non-epithelial tumors is achieved. Improved endoscopic procedures , including EUS-FNA and ESD/EMR , enabled the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of esophageal non-epithelial tumors.
