  Methanogens have already been described in periodontitis<disease> but not in peri-implantitis. Thirty peri-implantitis samples and 28 control samples were collected in 28 consenting peri-implantitis patients. PCR-sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used as a broad-spectrum screening method and results were further confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR targeting the mcrA genes. Results showed a methanogen community dominated by Methanobrevibacter oralis<pathogen> in 31/58 ( 51 %) samples including 16/28 ( 57 %) control samples and 15/30 ( 50 %) peri-implantitis samples. Methanobrevibacter massiliense<pathogen> was detected in 5/58 ( 8.6 %) samples including 3/28 ( 1 %) control samples and 2/30 ( 6.7 %) peri-implantitis samples. The prevalence of M. oralis<pathogen> or M.<pathogen> massiliense<pathogen> did not significantly differ in peri-implantitis and control samples ( exact Fisher test , P = 0.61 and P = 0.67 , respectively). Further ponderation of the methanogen load by the real-time quantitative PCR for actin human gene again indicated non-significant difference ( Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P = 0.48 and P = 0.40 , respectively). These data show that the prevalence of methanogens does not differ in peri-implantitis lesions<symptom> and healthy sites , when individuals are their own control. These data do not allow assigning a specific pathogenic role to methanogens in peri-implantitis; methanogens rather are part of the commensal and normal flora of the oral cavity.
