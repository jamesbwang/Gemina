  Medicinal mushrooms are used in popular medicine largely as health promoters , mainly because of their antitumor and immunomodulatory activities. Ganoderma lucidum ( lingzhi or reishi) and Agaricus brasiliensis<pathogen> are mushrooms that have long been used for medicinal purposes. This study evaluated their immunomodulatory and antitumor effects on mice fed a diet supplemented with G. lucidum and A.<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> mycelia obtained from solid-state fermentation. For 14 weeks the mice were fed chow containing 50 % A.<pathogen> brasiliensis<pathogen> and G. lucidum mycelia , using ground wheat as an excipient. The consumption of the supplemented diet inhibited Sarcoma<disease> 180 tumor growth and caused important changes in the immune system. The pattern of immune response shifted , increasing CD4 + and CD8 + and decreasing CD19 + cell populations. The restoration of a proper balance<symptom> between cellular and humoral immunity is an essential process for restraining tumor growth. These results suggest that polysaccharides , such as Î²-glucans and other mushroom metabolites , possibly promote the T-cell dominance that is imperative to restrain tumor growth.
