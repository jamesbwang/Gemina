  The aggregation of α-synuclein , an intrinsically disordered protein that is highly abundant in neurons , is closely associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson 's disease. We have shown previously that the aminosterol squalamine can inhibit the lipid induced initiation process in the aggregation of α-synuclein , and we report here that the related compound trodusquemine is capable of inhibiting not only this process but also the fibril-dependent secondary pathways in the aggregation reaction. We further demonstrate that trodusquemine can effectively suppress the toxicity of α-synuclein oligomers in neuronal cells , and that its administration , even after the initial growth phase , leads to a dramatic reduction in the number of α-synuclein inclusions<disease> in a Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> model of Parkinson 's disease , eliminates the related muscle<symptom> paralysis<symptom> , and increases lifespan. On the basis of these findings , we show that trodusquemine is able to inhibit multiple events in the aggregation process of α-synuclein and hence to provide important information about the link between such events and neurodegeneration , as it is initiated and progresses. Particularly in the light of the previously reported ability of trodusquemine to cross the blood-brain barrier and to promote tissue regeneration , the present results suggest that this compound has the potential to be an important therapeutic candidate for Parkinson 's disease and related disorders.
