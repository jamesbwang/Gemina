  Atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD) is a chronic and recurrent disease with an inflammatory background. Genetic and environmental factors are responsible for the occurrence and development of this dermatosis. The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of colonisation of the nasal vestibule and apparently healthy skin by <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> , and to assess dermal<symptom> lesions<symptom> for superinfection with <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> in AD patients. The research was performed on a population of 100 AD patients. Three smears were collected for microbiological investigations: from the anterior nares , from apparently healthy skin and from lesioned skin. On collection , the material was cultured on mediums provided by the bioMerieux and Argenta companies. The strains were identified and their sensitivity to antibiotics assessed by means of the Vitek2 system ( bioMerieux). <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> was present in at least one location in 90 %. 44 % presented <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> colonization of apparently healthy skin and within skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. In the case of 23 % , this particular pathogen was detected only in skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> , whereas 6 % had a positive result within the area of apparently healthy skin. In total , <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> was detected in the skin of 73 %. In 61 % , apparently healthy skin had been colonized with <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> , whereas in 81 % colonization was proved within the skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> was detected in the nasal vestibule of 85 %. Among the group with <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> in their anterior nares , the pathogen was also found on the skin surface of 77 %. <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> colonises skin in most AD patients. Most AD patients carry <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> in their nasal vestibules. <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> does not seem to colonise healthy skin as often as skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> in young people. The vast majority of <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> strains were sensitive to local antibiotics. Most <i> S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> </i> strains produced penicillinase.
