  Low pathogenic avian influenza<disease> ( LPAI) H9N2<pathogen> and infectious bronchitis<symptom> virus ( IBV<pathogen>) are important pathogens of poultry , causing important economic losses for the sector. Replication interference between these two viruses was described using cell cultures ( CC) and embryonated chicken eggs ( ECE). Chicken embryo lung ( CEL) and ECE were simultaneously or sequentially infected with IBV<pathogen> vaccine strain ( H120) and LPAIV-H9N2 ( A/Ck/TUN/ 145/2012) to evaluate viral interactionsin vitro and in ovo , respectively. Real-time RT-PCR was developed to specifically quantify both AIV and IBV<pathogen> genomes as well as viral gene copy numbers during mixed<disease> infections<disease>. The amount of IL-1 beta , in supernatants of co-infected cell cultures , was determined using an ELISA assay. Quantitative results of AIV and IBV<pathogen> co-infection showed that interferences between the two viruses yielded decreased viral growth. However , in the case of super-infection , the second virus , either AIV or IBV<pathogen> , induced a decrease in the growth of the first inoculated virus. It appears that either AIV or IBV<pathogen> has a negative impact on the other virus growth when they are inoculated simultaneously or sequentially. The ELISA results showed that higher level of secreted IL-1beta varies , depending on the viral interference conditions between both viruses , during
