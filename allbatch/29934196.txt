  Parkinson 's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder presenting with a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. The motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> manifest as a result of the progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The axons of these neurons project to the striatum<pathogen> as the nigrostriatal pathway , which is a crucial part of the basal ganglia circuitry controlling movement. In addition to the neuronal degeneration , abnormal intraneuronal α-synuclein protein inclusions<disease> called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites increase in number and spread throughout the nervous system as the disease progresses. While the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons is well-established as being central to motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , there is an increasing focus on the timing of nigrostriatal degeneration , with preclinical evidence suggesting that early axonal degeneration may play a key role in the early stages of Parkinson 's disease. Here we review recent evidence for early midbrain dopaminergic axonal degeneration in patients with Parkinson 's disease , and explore the potential role of α-synuclein accumulation in this process , with a focus on studies in human populations at the imaging , post-mortem , cellular and molecular levels. Finally , we discuss the implications of this for neurotrophic factor therapies for Parkinson 's disease.
