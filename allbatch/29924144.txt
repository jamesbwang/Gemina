  To describe the parasitic community of the Magellanic Horned Owl , Bubo<symptom> magellanicus ( Aves , Strigiformes) , 19 carcasses from central Chile were analyzed. Ectoparasites were collected through plumage inspection , while endoparasites were collected through traditional techniques of parasitological necropsy<disease>. Sixteen owls were infected with at least one species of ectoparasite ( 84.21 %) or endoparasite ( 31.58 %). Eleven of 19 birds ( 57.89 %) harbored feather mites of the three species Pandalura cirrata ( 42.11 %) , Glaucalges attenuatus ( 47.37 %) , and Kramerella sp. ( 10.53 %) , whereas 16 individuals ( 84.21 %) harbored the chewing louse Strigiphilus chilensis. Only six birds ( 31.58 %) were infected with helminths; the nematodes Capillaria tenuissima<pathogen> ( 26.32 %) and Dispharynx nasuta ( 5.26 %); the acanthocephalan Centrorhynchus spinosus<pathogen> ( 5.26 %); and the trematode Neodiplostomum sp. ( 5.26 %). Apart from S. chilensis , all parasites comprised new records for B. magellanicus.
