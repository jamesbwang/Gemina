  Pleomorphic liposarcoma ( PLPS) is a recalcitrant soft-tissue sarcoma<disease> ( STS) subtype<pathogen> in need of transformative therapy. We have previously established a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft ( PDOX) model , of PLPS with PDGFRA amplification , using surgical orthotopic implantation. In the current study , the PLPS PDOX model was randomized into 3 groups of 7 mice each: untreated control; doxorubicin ( DOX)- treated; and treated with Salmonella<disease> typhimurium<pathogen> A1-R ( S.<pathogen> typhimurium<pathogen> A1-R) expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP). Tumor volume and body<symptom> weight were monitored during the treatment period. The PLPS PDOX was resistant to DOX. In contrast , the PLPS PDOX was highly sensitive to S.<pathogen> typhimurium<pathogen> A1-R. There was no significant body-weight loss among these 3 groups. Fluorescence imaging demonstrated that S.<pathogen> typhimurium<pathogen> A1-R-GFP was very effective to target the PLPS PDOX tumor. The current study demonstrates that a PLPS PDOX , resistant to first-line therapy DOX , was highly sensitive to tumor targeting S.<pathogen> typhimurium<pathogen> A1-R.
