  A 58-year-old man presented with tamponade , and he underwent an emergency pericardiocentesis. We made the diagnosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) pericarditis<disease> based on culture results , and treated the patient with pericardial drainage and antibiotics as the first-line therapy. After temporary relief , reaccumulation of effusion<symptom> developed. We successfully created a pericardial window using thoracotomy , and the postoperative course was uneventful. MRSA pericarditis<disease> is an extremely rare and life-threatening illness. No consensus exists concerning the ideal surgical intervention. Creating a pericardial window using thoracotomy can be an effective definitive therapy for MRSA pericarditis<disease> , especially for patients with significant pericardial adhesions.
