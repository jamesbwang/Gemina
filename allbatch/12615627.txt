  Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions and are associated with risks of invasive<disease> infections<disease>. We present a diagnostically challenging patient with unique comorbidities and travel history. A 53-year-old man with a history of polysubstance abuse and psoriasis on adalimumab presented to our hospital directly from the airport with fever<disease> , dyspnea<symptom> , and cough<symptom> He had been living in Costa Rica and engaged in many outdoor activities. Within 6 hours and a limited history , he was intubated; vasopressors and antimicrobials were promptly administered. An extensive infectious<disease> disease<disease> investigation was undertaken , considering potential travel-related exposures and his immunosuppressive state. However , multi-organ failure with worsening disseminated intravascular coagulation ensued , and within four days of admission , the patient passed away. Five days after his death , the urine Histoplasma<pathogen> antigen resulted positive. Disseminated histoplasmosis should be suspected in a patient on anti-TNF therapy , with a severe febrile illness and pneumonia<disease> refractory to antibacterial therapy. A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis and initiate prompt treatment.
