  Surgical management has been the main approach for enteral fistulae<disease>. This approach is usually complex due to comorbidities , a wasted nutritional state and anatomical difficulties related to prior multiple interventions. Therefore , endoscopic methods such as clips , self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS) and recently , the over scope clip ( OTSC Â®) are increasing in popularity and use. Herein , we present the case of a patient with a HIV<pathogen> infection who was admitted due to respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. Radiological and microbiological studies documented a tracheoesophageal fistula<disease> due to tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV) infection. Therefore , an esophageal fully-covered stent was placed , which migrated into the stomach. The thoracic surgeons considered an esophagectomy with gastric ascent and muscle patch in the trachea. However , due to his poor nutritional status and comorbidity , an OTSC was placed to treat the fistulae<disease>. The patient also received medical treatment with anti-tuberculotics and anti-retrovirals.
