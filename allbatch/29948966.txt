  To investigate the clinical features of necrotizing pneumonia<disease> ( NP) caused by refractory Mycoplasma<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> pneumonia<disease> ( RMPP). A retrospective observational study was carried out in patients with NP caused by RMPP who were admitted to our hospital from January 2008 to December 2015 , and the clinical manifestations , laboratory data , imaging performances , hospital courses and outcomes were analyzed. Twenty-five patients with NP caused by RMPP were collected , with a median age of 5.1 ( 4.0-7.9) years. The mean duration of fever<disease> and hospital stay was 21.0 ± 8.9 and 19.9 ± 9.9 days , respectively. The levels of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) , C-reactive protein , interleukin ( IL) -6 , IL-10 and interferon-gamma were elevated. Meanwhile , the pleural fluid cell count , LDH and protein were also increased. 80.0 % of the patients had pleural effusion<symptom>; and a high incidence of lobar atelectasis and pulmonary<symptom> consolidation<symptom> was found the patients. The mean duration from the onset of symptoms to the discovery of necrotic<symptom> lesions<symptom> was 21.0 ± 6.9 days. 80.0 % of the patients were administrated corticosteroids , and bronchoalveolar lavage was extracted separately from all patients. Of the 20 patients who presented with pleural effusion<symptom> , 11 underwent thoracocentesis alone and 2 underwent chest drainage. All patients received prolonged courses of antibiotics ( 32.2 ± 8.7 days). All patients were dischaged home and recovered without surgical intervention; and chest<symptom> lesions<symptom> were resolved or only minimal residual fibrotic changes were residual within 3.0 ( 2.0-6.0) months. Necrotizing pneumonia<disease> caused by RMPP is severe , however , self-limiting and reversible. Good outcomes can be achieved with appropriate management.
