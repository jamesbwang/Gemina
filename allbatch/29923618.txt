  This study aimed to evaluate the use of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy ( aPDT) as an adjunct for minimally invasive treatment ( partial removal of carious tissue- PRCT) of deciduous carious tissue evaluating its efficacy in reducing microorganisms. For that , a clinical study was design including children with deciduous molars with active deep caries<disease> lesions<symptom> ( DCL). PRCT was performed and remaining dentin was treated with 100 μg/mL methylene blue solution ( 5 min) and than irradiated with a low power laser emitting red light ( InGaAIP- indium gallium aluminum phosphide; λ = 660nm; 100mW; 300 J/cm ²; 90s; 9J). The colony forming units ( CFU) count after PRCT and after PRCT + aPDT/mg of dentin were compared for total microorganisms , including Candida spp. , the mutans<pathogen> streptococci group , Streptococcus<pathogen> spp. and Lactobacillus<pathogen> spp.. The dentin was classified ( color , consistency and humidity). The microbial reduction varied from 69.88 % to 86.29 % and was significantly observed for total microorganisms , mutans<pathogen> streptococci , Streptococcus<pathogen> spp. and Lactobacillus<pathogen> spp ( p < 0.001). The dentin type did not influence reduction of microorganisms ( p > 0.05). The aPDT presents a promising future for clinical use as an adjunct for the reduction of microorganisms in PRCT of DCL in all kinds of dentin. This article is protected by copyright.
