  In the literature , cases of blastomycosis in Canada have been documented in provinces bordering the Great Lakes , including Ontario and Quebec , as well as Manitoba. This is the first study to our knowledge reporting cases of mycosis<disease> seen in southern Saskatchewan suggesting a broader area of endemicity. We searched the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region ( RQHR) Microbiology Laboratory for all culture-confirmed cases of Blastomyces from January 2000 to December 2015 and identified 15 cases. Thirteen cases were reviewed , identifying common presenting symptoms , misdiagnosis , comorbidities , travel history , time from presentation to diagnosis , diagnostic specimen , treatment , and clinical outcome. Nine patients had no travel to areas known to be endemic to environmental blastomycosis. Eight patients presented with respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , four with skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> , four with constitutional symptoms , and one presented with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> after a fall. Initial misdiagnosis occurred in nine ( 69 %) of the 13 cases , and all six patients that died of the disease were misdiagnosed. These six patients ( 46 %) were acutely ill with refractory disseminated disease , leading to respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>. It is probable that Blastomyces<pathogen> is present as an endemic fungus in the soil of southern Saskatchewan. Possibly due to a lack of awareness of this pathogen in the area , initial misdiagnoses were common and likely contributed to significant morbidity and mortality.
