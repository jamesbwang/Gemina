  To report the finding of transmural rectal involvement , in four children with lesions<symptom> which seemed to be neoplastic in appearance and progression. The case records of four children presenting with rectal involvement by the fungus Basidiobolus<pathogen> ranarum<pathogen> , were retrospectively analyzed for clinical presentation , hematological and radiological investigations , the procurement of histopathological material for diagnosis and the findings thereof , the treatment of these patients and the follow-up. The four children presented with non-specific symptoms of fever<disease> , loss of weight and appetite<symptom> , constipation<symptom> and bleeding per rectum. One presented with excoriation and ulceration of the perineum and perianal skin. Examination generally unremarkable , however , showed the rectum extensively involved by a lesion<symptom> which narrowed the lumen. Hematological investigations showed leukocytosis with eosinophilia and raised levels of acute phase reactants like ESR , platelets , and C-reactive proteins. Ultrasonogram ( USG) and CT scan confirmed the lesion<symptom> to be involving all layers of the rectum and compromising the rectal lumen. The right colon was also involved in one patient. One underwent a colonoscopy and biopsy which proved inconclusive. All four underwent a Tru-cut biopsy which was diagnostic. Histopathologically the disease was based in Basidiobolus<pathogen> ranarum<pathogen> , a fungus which is emerging as a cause of visceral abdominal involvement. Lesions<symptom> involving the rectum , and appearing to be neoplastic may be caused by the fungus Basidiobolus<pathogen> ranarum<pathogen> The symptomatology and presentation may be non-specific. High levels of eosinophils in the blood , a raised ESR , and C-reactive protein may be useful pointers to the diagnosis. USG and CT scans localize the lesions<symptom> and also provide a guide for biopsies. The characteristic histopathological findings are diagnostic and based on these , treatment with Itroconazole/ Voriconazole is beneficial.
