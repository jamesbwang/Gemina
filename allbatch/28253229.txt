  Since the 1988 inception of the Global Polio<disease> Eradication Initiative ( GPEI) , progress toward interruption of wild poliovirus<pathogen> ( WPV) transmission has occurred mostly through extensive use of oral poliovirus<pathogen> vaccine ( OPV) in mass vaccination campaigns and through routine immunization services ( 1,2). However , because OPV contains live , attenuated virus , it carries the rare risk for reversion to neurovirulence. In areas with very low OPV coverage , prolonged transmission of vaccine-associated viruses can lead to the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses ( VDPVs) , which can cause outbreaks of paralytic<disease> poliomyelitis<disease> Although WPV type 2 has not been detected since 1999 , and was declared eradicated in 2015 , * most VDPV outbreaks have been attributable to VDPV serotype 2 ( VDPV2) ( 3,4). After the synchronized global switch from trivalent OPV ( tOPV) ( containing vaccine virus types 1 , 2 , and 3) to bivalent OPV ( bOPV) ( types 1 and 3) in April 2016 ( 5) , GPEI regards any VDPV2 emergence as a public health emergency ( 6,7). During May-June 2017 , VDPV2 was isolated from stool<symptom> specimens from two children with acute flaccid<symptom> paralysis<symptom> ( AFP) in Deir-ez-Zor governorate , Syria. The first isolate differed from Sabin vaccine virus by 22 nucleotides in the VP1 coding region ( 903 nucleotides). Genetic sequence analysis linked the two cases , confirming an outbreak of circulating VDPV2 ( cVDPV2). Poliovirus<pathogen> surveillance activities were intensified , and three rounds of vaccination campaigns , aimed at children aged < 5 years , were conducted using monovalent OPV type 2 ( mOPV2). During the outbreak , 74 cVDPV2 cases were identified; the most recent occurred in September 2017. Evidence indicates that enhanced surveillance measures coupled with vaccination activities using mOPV2 have interrupted cVDPV2 transmission in Syria.
