  Sepsis<disease> is the systemic response to infection manifested as hyperthermia<symptom> or hypothermia<symptom> , tachycardia<symptom> , tachypnea , and shock<symptom>. This condition represents a major life-threatening factor in all age groups , particularly in neonatal period. The present study aimed to examine the results of blood , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) , and urine culture tests in suspected neonatal<disease> sepsis<disease> cases in northwestern Iran.This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on suspected neonatal<disease> sepsis<disease> cases hospitalized in Tabriz Children 's Hospital. All subjects underwent complete blood count with white blood differential , C-reactive protein , blood culture and , if deemed necessary , CSF and urine culture tests and analyses. Laboratory findings in positive culture cases were scored based on the hematological scoring system ( HSS) for the diagnosis of neonatal<disease> sepsis<disease> The data were then collected , entered into SPSS v18 and analyzed.Among 838 suspected neonatal<disease> sepsis<disease> cases , 102 ( 12.17 %) neonates with positive cultures were examined; 59.8 % of whom were male with a mean age of 9.9 days , gestational age of 36.91 weeks , and mean weight of 2.966 kg. 76.47 % of neonates with positive culture were term , 69.6 % had normal birth weights , 68.6 % were diagnoses with late-onset sepsis<disease> , 65.68 % had positive blood culture , 38.23 % had positive urine culture with no positive CSF culture case. Poor<symptom> feeding<symptom> ( 39.21 %) and lethargy<symptom> ( 35.29 %) were the most common clinical symptoms and previous history of hospital stay ( 40.19 %) and surgery ( 21.56 %) the most common risk factors for neonatal<disease> sepsis<disease> development. Results revealed that 50 ( 49.01 %) neonates achieved HSS scores equal or greater than 2 ( HSS â‰¥ 2) , and that the mean HSS score in deceased positive blood culture neonates was significantly higher than that of survived ones ( 2.21 vs 1.37). In this study , coagulase-negative staphylococcus<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> represented the most common bacteria isolated from blood with 37.31 % and 12.43 % , respectively. Fungi<pathogen> ( 38.5 %) and Klebsiella<pathogen> ( 28.20 %) were the most common microorganic urine isolates.The results suggested that only a small percentage of suspected neonatal<disease> sepsis<disease> cases had positive blood and/or urine cultures ( 12.17 %) and that coagulase-negative staphylococcus<pathogen> ( CoNS) and S aureus<pathogen> were highly prevalent in positive blood cultures , whereas fungi<pathogen> and Klebsiella were the most common microorganisms found in positive urine cultures.
