  Sternal<disease> wound<disease> infections<disease> after pediatric cardiac surgery are uncommon but can be morbid. We describe an institutional protocol for complicated sternal<disease> wounds<disease> utilizing hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBO) and negative pressure wound<disease> therapy ( NPWT). A retrospective chart review ( 2001-2013) of 4,028 pediatric cardiac operations in 3,264 patients less than 18 years of age. Fifty-three patients ( 1.62 %; 53/3 ,264) were diagnosed with clinical sternal<disease> wound<disease> infections<disease>. There were 27 ( 50.9 %) males and 26 ( 49.1 %) females. Thirty-seven ( 69.8 %) patients received antibiotics and/or debridement; sixteen ( 30.2 %) patients had more complicated infections requiring NPWT and/or HBO therapy. The time to heal for wounds<disease> treated with HBO and HBO + NPWT was a mean of 43.75 ( Â± 24.27) days ( range: 21-98 days; median: 35 days). Among all infected patients , the time from diagnosis of the infection to resolution of the infection for all survivors was 7 to 98 days ( mean: 26.41 days; median: 21 days). Forty-eight ( 90.6 %) patients completely healed their wounds<disease> , and 45 ( 84.9 %) patients are currently alive. Thirty-eight patients had a cyanotic cardiac diagnosis and 15 had an acyanotic cardiac diagnosis. The most common bacteria isolated from the blood or wound<disease> cultures was Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> Six of 53 patients died. Causes of death are as follows: three from respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> , one from sepsis<disease> , one from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy , and one from exsanguination leading to cardiac arrest Conclusions: Complicated sternal<disease> wound<disease> infections<disease> after pediatric cardiac surgery refractory to antibiotic therapy and/or debridement can be successfully treated with NPWT and/or HBO therapy.
