  The influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 virus caused a worldwide pandemic in 2009-2010 and has since remained in seasonal circulation. This study was conducted to determine any variations in the influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 status according to sex , age group , sample type , or location within the Eastern<disease> Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Samples from 749 patients with suspected Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> respiratory<pathogen> coronavirus<pathogen> who presented to Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare facilities in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia were tested reflexively for influenza<disease> A/H1N1 2009 by the Ministry of Health using the RealTime ready Influenza<disease> A/H1N1 Detection Set for real-time PCR. The sample types included nasopharyngeal swabs ( n = 677) , expectorated deep cough<symptom> sputum<symptom> ( n = 32) , induced sputum<symptom> ( n = 17) , and tracheal aspirates ( n = 23). The incidence of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 was higher among younger patients; 27.94 % of patients in the 0-19-year age group tested positive compared to only 3.51 % of patients in the â‰¥ 80-year age group. The incidence of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 was higher in Ras Tanura city compared to other locations in the Eastern Province. Younger individuals in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had a relatively higher risk of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 infection. Additionally , an outbreak of influenza<disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 may have occurred in Ras Tanura city between April 2015 and February 2016.
