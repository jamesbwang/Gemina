  We assessed the prevalence and predictors of Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> , Neisseriagonorrhoeae and Mycoplasmagenitalium rectal<disease> infections<disease> in a population of ` men having sex with men ' ( MSM). From January to November 2017 , 165 MSM attending a STI outpatients clinic in Bologna ( Italy) and reporting unsafe anal intercourses were enrolled. An ano-rectal swab was collected from each patient: chlamydial and gonococcal infections were diagnosed by a commercial NAAT , whereas an in-house quantitative PCR was used for M.<pathogen> genitalium<pathogen> detection. In addition , 131 urine samples and 84 pharyngeal<symptom> swabs underwent testing for C.<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> and N.<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen>. A molecular C.<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> typing , a serological screening for anti-Chlamydia IgG and IgA , as well as the assessment of HIV<pathogen> , HCV and syphilis<disease> infections , were performed.Results/ Key findings. The prevalence of C.<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> , N.<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> and M.<pathogen> genitalium<pathogen> rectal<disease> infections<disease> was 27.2 , 25.4 and 4.8 % , respectively. Globally , 63.1 % of cases were asymptomatic and up to 80 % of chlamydial and gonococcal infections would have been missed if the rectal site had not been tested. All the patients with rectal M.<pathogen> genitalium<pathogen> carriage were asymptomatic and characterized by low bacterial loads ( < 2500 DNA copies/reaction). Lymphogranuloma<disease> venereum<disease> ( LGV) prevalence was 12.1 % with a considerable proportion of asymptomatic infections ( 35 %). The presence of symptoms , age > 30 , HIV-positivity and elevated levels of anti-Chlamydia antibodies were the most significant predictors of LGV. Sexually transmitted rectal<disease> infections<disease> are frequent and often asymptomatic among MSM. LGV prevalence is high in our country and there is increasing evidence of symptomless cases.
