  The highly prevalent and virulent disease in the Western Hemisphere Coccidioidomycosis , also known as Valley<disease> Fever<disease> , can cause serious illness such as severe pneumonia<disease> with respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>. It can also take on a disseminated form where the infection spreads throughout the body. Thus , a serious impetus exists to develop effective detection of the disease that can also operate in a rapid and high-throughput fashion. Here , we report the assembly of a highly sensitive biosensor using reduced graphene oxide ( rGO) with Coccidioides<pathogen> ( cocci) antibodies as the target analytes. The facile design made possible by the scalable microcontact printing ( Î¼CP) surface patterning technique which enables rapid , ultrasensitive detection. It provides a wide linear range and sub picomolar ( 2.5 pg/ml) detection , while also delivering high selectivity and reproducibility. This work demonstrates an important advancement in the development of a sensitive label-free rGO biosensor for Coccidioidomycosis<disease> detection. This result also provides the potential application of direct pathogen diagnosis for the future biosensor development.
