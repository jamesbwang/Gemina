  Crohn 's disease ( CD) is caused by a trigger , almost certainly enteric<disease> infection<disease> by one of a multitude of organisms that allows faeces access to the tissues , at which stage the response of individuals predisposed to CD is abnormal. In CD the failure of acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom> results in the failure to recruit neutrophils to the inflammatory site , as a consequence of which the clearance of bacteria from the tissues is defective. The retained faecal products result in the characteristic chronic granulomatous<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and adaptive immune response. Impaired of digestion of bacteria and fungi<pathogen> by CGD neutrophils can result in a similar pathological and clinical picture. The neutrophils in CD are normal and their inadequate accumulation at sites of inflammation<symptom> generally results from diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages consequent upon disordered vesicle trafficking.
