  Aspiration pneumonia<disease> has a high incidence in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia<disease> and results in high mortality rates. We aimed to evaluate microbiology and assess prognostic factors of aspiration pneumonia<disease> in the setting of a tertiary hospital pulmonology department. Community-acquired ( CAAP) and healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia<disease> ( HCAAP) cases hospitalized over a period of a year were prospectively followed. Demographic , clinical , biological and radiological data were recorded at admission , while sputum<symptom> , tracheal aspirates or bronchial washing samples were collected within 48 hours of admission. During hospital stay , therapeutic and supportive measures and resulting complications were recorded. Regression analysis was applied to find statistically significant prognostic factors. The sample consisted of 70 patients ( 67.1 % men); 55.7 % of them presented as HCAAP; 94.3 % had positive culture of lower respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> specimens with isolation of 115 pathogens , 47 of which were multidrug- or extensively drug-resistant. The most common pathogens were Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> ( 37.1 %) , Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 27.1 %) , Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( 25.7 %) and Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> ( 20 %). Empiric antimicrobial therapy was combination therapy in 70 % and included antipseudomonal and MRSA-targeted antibiotics in 61.4 % and 11.4 % , respectively. Patients in the HCAAP group had a higher rate of antibiotics usage in the previous trimester , more frequent isolation of resistant strains and were more likely to receive inadequate empiric treatment than those in the CAAP group. In-hospital mortality was 52.2 %; no difference between groups was noted. Independent factors of increased mortality were older age ( p = 0.004) , low serum albumin levels ( p = 0.039) , increased radiological involvement ( p = 0.050) and ineffective initial therapy ( p = 0.001). We concluded that patients hospitalized for aspiration pneumonia<disease> have frequent contact with healthcare services and acquire multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Empiric therapy should target these specific microorganisms as its success determines the prognosis.
