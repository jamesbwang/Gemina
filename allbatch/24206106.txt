  A 79-year-old female with a history of keratoconjunctivitis sicca<pathogen> presented with several years of epiphora of both eyes. Thirteen years earlier , intracanalicular Herrick lacrimal plugs ( Lacrimedics , Eastsound , WA , USA) had been placed in both eyes to treat her dry<symptom> eye<disease> syndrome<disease>. After 13 years the patient felt the epiphora was intolerable and underwent endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy ( DCR) of the left , then the right side. Intraoperatively , during the right endoscopic DCR , a Herrick lacrimal plug was found in the common canaliculus into the lacrimal sac. Postoperatively , the patient did well with improved epiphora. The Herrick plug is designed to be intracanalicular , and this case illustrates that the plug can migrate and be retained for many years. Collared punctal plugs have a lower risk of this type of complication.
