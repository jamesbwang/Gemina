  Approximately 350-400 million people in the world have Hbs Ag ( hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> surface antigen) positivity. In the international guidelines , the permanent suppression of replication in chronic hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) infection therapy is reported as the primary therapeutic goal. Trace elements play a key role in liver diseases. The aim of our study is to determine some trace element concentrations in the liver during HBV treatment periods. The measurement of 11 trace elements ( manganese , lead , nickel , chromium , cadmium , iron , copper , zinc , silver , cobalt , and aluminum) was carried out by the method of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in liver biopsy materials ( before starting treatment and at the sixth month of the treatment period). There was an increase in zinc and copper concentrations in liver materials at the sixth month of treatment compared to the pre-treatment values ( the median zinc value was 48.05 μg/g before treatment and 74.9 μg/g at 6 months after initial treatment , p = 0.035; median copper was 2.82 μg/g before treatment and 5.31 μg/g after 6 months , p = 0.002). General estimations indicated that zinc ( p = 0.002) , iron ( p = 0.0244) , copper ( p = 0.0003) , and aluminum ( p = 0.0239) values may be effective in HAI ( histological activity index) changes. Only iron levels could be at a very low level effective on the changes caused by fibrosis<disease> ( p = 0.0002). Liver tissue zinc and copper levels increased in parallel with the improvement of inflammation<symptom> in antiviral-treated HBV patients. In addition , the levels of zinc and copper in the liver tissue can be useful markers for liver tissue damage detection.
