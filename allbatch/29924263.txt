  Pott 's disease is a health problem in developing countries and its diagnosis in children is a challenge. Here we present the case of a two-year-old boy with Pott 's disease involving T1 to T3 thoracic vertebrae. The clinical presentation was characterized by difficulty walking , fever<disease> , cough<symptom> , and dyspnea<symptom>. At physical examination , kyphosis and bony prominence were observed in the cervicodorsal area. A positive tuberculin test was obtained , and Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> was isolated via culture of the gastric aspiration sample. The spine MRI showed a chronic<symptom> abscess<symptom> , destruction of two vertebrae , and bone<disease> marrow compression. The patient experienced some improvement with anti-TB therapy. Here , we emphasize the importance of giving consideration to the clinical suspicion for the early detection of this condition , as well as a quick TB-treatment start so as to avoid the disability and mortality associated to this disease.
