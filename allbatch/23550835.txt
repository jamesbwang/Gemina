  Sin<pathogen> Nombre<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( SNV<pathogen>) causes hantavirus<pathogen> cardiopulmonary pulmonary<disease> syndrome<disease> ( HCPS) with the loss of pulmonary vascular endothelial integrity , and pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> without causing cytopathic effects on the vascular endothelium. HCPS is associated primarily with a dysregulated immune response. We previously found occult signs of hemostatic imbalance in the form of a sharp > 30-100 fold increase in the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI-1) , in serial blood plasma draws of terminal stage-patients. However , the mechanism of the increase in PAI-1 remains unclear. PAI-1 is a primary inhibitor of fibrinolysis caused by tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator plasma ( uPA). Here , we investigate factors that contribute to PAI-1 upregulation during HCPS. Using zymography , we found evidence of PAI-1-refractory uPA activity and no tPA activity in plasma samples drawn from HCPS patients. The sole prevalence of uPA activity suggested that severe<symptom> inflammation<symptom> drove PAI-1 activity. We have recently reported that the P2Y
