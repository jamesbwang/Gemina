  Rotavirus<pathogen> is the leading cause of acute watery diarrhoea<disease> among children and is vaccine preventable. The aim of this hospital-based sentinel surveillance was to study the prevalence , demographic and clinical characteristics of rotavirus<pathogen> infections and to describe rotavirus<pathogen> genotype distribution patterns among children under five years of age hospitalized for acute watery diarrhea<disease> during the period of 2009-2016. Prospective , sentinel hospital-based surveillance was conducted in Lady Ridgeway Hospital ( LRH) from 2009 to 2016. Stool<symptom> samples of children admitted with acute watery diarrhea<disease> were tested by rotavirus<pathogen> antigen detection ` ProSpecT ' Enzyme Immunoassay ( EIA) at Department of Virology , Medical Research Institute , Colombo. Specimens that tested positive for rotavirus<pathogen> were further analyzed at the Regional Reference Laboratory ( RRL) participating in the World Health Organization ( WHO)- coordinated Global Rotavirus Surveillance Network ( GRSN) to determine the genotype of strains by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Of the 6090 children with diarrhea<disease> admitted , 1801 ( 29.5 %) had stools<symptom> taken and tested. In years with at least 11 months of data ( 2010 and 2013) rotavirus<pathogen> was detected in 36.5 % ( 228/624) of specimens. Genotype G1P ( 8) was the most common genotype detected throughout the surveillance period ( 30.1 %; 123/408) with G2P ( 8) , G9P ( 8) and G3P ( 8) also detected. Rotavirus<pathogen> is a common cause of pediatric diarrhea<disease> hospitalizations in Sri Lanka. National introduction of rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine could reduce the burden of pediatric
