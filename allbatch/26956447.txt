  None Our patient was a 75-year-old Caucasian Navy veteran , who served in Vietnam as a part of the Swift Boat service in 1966. He presented to his primary care provider with uncontrolled nonproductive cough<symptom> and abnormal chest computerized tomography. Bronchoscopy specimens showed Talaromycosis generally presents as pulmonary<disease> infection<disease> with manifestations similar with other endemic fungi<pathogen> It is often seen HIV<pathogen> patients with travel to South east Asia. Very rarely this infection is seen and reported in non-immunosuppressed and in non-endemic areas. To date there are 4 well-documented cases among non-HIV , non-endemic population. Talaromyces<pathogen> can cause infection in non-HIV and non-endemic population and could be an underrecognized cause of pulmonary<disease> infections<disease> among veterans with even a remote history of exposure to the organism during deployment.
