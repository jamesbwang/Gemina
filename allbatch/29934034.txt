  The clinical , epidemiological , and laboratory factors associated with disease severity and mortality from confirmed leptospirosis<disease> patients in Taiwan are not well known. This retrospective study examined patients with suspected leptospirosis<disease> admitted to En-Chu-Kong Hospital , a regional teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. From January 2002 to July 2014 , 733 suspected cases were reported to the National Reference Laboratory , 57 of which were identified as laboratory and clinical confirmed. We analyzed the clinical , epidemiological , and laboratory factors associated with disease severity and mortality in 57 cases. The mean age was 59.1 Â± 18.2 years , 74 % were male , and 49 % had occupational contact with soil. The major complications were pulmonary involvement ( 54 %) , shock<symptom> ( 44 %) , ventilator support ( 32 %) , jaundice ( 32 %) , hemorrhage<symptom> ( 30 %) , acute kidney injury ( 30 %) , meningitis<disease> ( 11 %) and myocarditis<disease> ( 2 %). Leptospira<pathogen> santarosai<pathogen> serova Shermani was present in 42 ( 74 %) patients and 37 ( 58 %) patients had severe leptospirosis<disease> Sixteen ( 28 %) patients had concomitant infections , including nine patients with bloodstream infection. The only independent predictor for severe leptospirosis<disease> was shock<symptom> ( OR 14.8 , 95 % CI 2.97-73.59). Eleven patients died ( 19 %). Acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> with severe<symptom> pulmonary<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom> syndrome<disease> ( 6 patients) was present in 55 % of the fatal cases. The factors independently related to mortality were prior steroid use ( OR 20.2 , 95 % CI 1.9-217.5) and hemorrhage<symptom> ( OR 71.2 , 95 % CI 4.9- > 999.9). These results indicate that shock<symptom> is a predictor of severe leptospirosis<disease> , and prior steroid use and hemorrhage<symptom> are predictors of death from
