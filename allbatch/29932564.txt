  This quality improvement project evaluated whether offering a series of 5 structured interdisciplinary diabetic educational teaching sessions would improve glycemic control as measured by random blood sugars ( RBS) in a Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly ( PACE). Five diabetic educational sessions were held over a 4-week period with 50 participants ( N = 50). Data were analyzed and displayed using descriptive statistics and figures. Average RBS remained steady from 176.34 pre- to 175.52 post-intervention. In the Mini<pathogen> Mental<symptom> State Exam ( MMSE) group , representing a cognitive test score range of 24-30 , RBS decreased from 184.6 to 162.80 , with a slight increase in RBS in other groups. Mean RBS only decreased in the MMSE 24-30 test score range. African-American women and those in the community showed improved RBS. An interdisciplinary approach to care may offer benefits in subgroups of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM) patients and management of other chronic<disease> diseases<disease> in a geriatric population.
