  Sacral fractures with spinopelvic dissociation are rare , and hard to diagnose and treat. Fractures with a H- or U-shaped line are severely unstable , due to a dissociation of the spine and of the upper body of the sacrum from the pelvis. They are commonly due to high-energy trauma events , with severe neurological injuries in 80 % of cases. Five polytraumatized Caucasian patients , three women and two men ( mean age: 34 years old) with spinopelvic dissociation were selected. All patients underwent level I-II examinations with radiographs and computed tomography total-body scans; all patients needed damage-control procedures. Sacral fractures were classified according to Denis and Roy-Camille classifications , and neurologic injuries of cauda equina<pathogen> according to Gibbons classification. Patients ' outcome was analyzed with the Majeed score. Definitive surgical treatment was appropriate for two patients ( lumbar-pelvic fixation or transverse bar). Clinical and radiographic outcomes were analyzed periodically. Four patients survived , all of them suffered severe neurologic deficits. One case of osteomyelitis<disease> was treated with the removal of the fixation implants 23 months after the accident. Diagnosis of spinopelvic dissociation is frequently overlooked due to the severe associated injuries affecting these patients. In cases of a fall from high height , this lesion<symptom> should be investigated with a lateral sacral radiographic view and computed tomography scan of the pelvis. If untreated , it can lead to severe and progressive neurologic deficit with muskuloskeletal deformities and persistent pain. Early decompression treatment is controversial , but an early lumbopelvic fixation is recommended. A correct diagnosis and early treatment can reduce morbidity and strongly improve the outcome of these patients.
