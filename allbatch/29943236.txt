  To explore the molecular-level mechanism on the hematopoiesis effect of Angelicae Sinensis<pathogen> Radix ( ASR) with systems-based interactome analysis. This systems-based interactome analysis was designed to enforce the workflow of `` ASR ( herb) → compound → target protein → internal protein actions → ending regulated protein for hematopoiesis ''. This workflow was deployed with restrictions on regulated proteins expresses in bone<disease> marrow and anemia<symptom> disease and futher validated with experiments. The hematopoiesis mechanism of ASR might be accomplished through regulating pathways of cell proliferation towards hemopoiesis with cross-talking agents of spleen tyrosine kinase ( SYK) , Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2) , and interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase ( ITK). The hematopoietic function of ASR was also validated by colony-forming assay performed on mice bone<disease> marrow cells. As a result , SYK , JAK2 and ITK were activated. This study provides a new approach to systematically study and predict the therapeutic mechanism for ASR based on interactome analysis towards biological process with experimental validations.
