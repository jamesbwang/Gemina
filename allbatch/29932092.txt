  Mycetoma<disease> ( or `` madura<disease> foot '') is characterized by deformation , cutaneous lesions<symptom> , infection of tissues extending from the cutaneous layer to the underlying fascia , and an indolent course. A number of fungal or bacterial agents that are introduced through traumatic inoculation can be responsible for the disease , but Actinomadura<pathogen> madurae<pathogen> is among the most common agents of mycetoma<disease> occurring worldwide. We report a case of madura<disease> foot caused by A.<pathogen> madurae<pathogen> in an immunocompetent young Somali man who was admitted with a diagnosis of skin and soft<disease> tissue<disease> infection<disease> of the left foot with osteomyelitis<disease> The present report emphasizes the importance of the knowledge of this infection , which is sporadic but problematic to treat and , above all , difficult to diagnose. Moreover , a multidisciplinary approach with involvement of an infectious<disease> diseases<disease> specialist with experience in tropical diseases and a microbiology unit performing rapid molecular diagnostic tests is required for early diagnosis and an optimal antibiotic therapy.
