  Influenza<disease> A<pathogen> in hospitalized adults uncommonly may present with neurologic manifestations , e.g. , encephalitis<disease>. Encephalitis<disease> is the most common influenza<disease> related neurologic complication in adults , However , seizures<symptom> in hospitalized adults due to influenza<disease> are extremely rare. This is a case of a 58 year old female hospitalized for influenza<disease> A. On admission , she was confused and obtunded. Her EEG showed diffuse global slowing indicative of encephalitis<disease>. On hospital day ( HD) # 2 , she had a seizure<symptom>. She had no history of a seizure<symptom> disorder , and was not febrile at the time of the seizure<symptom>. While seizures<symptom> are not uncommon in children ( febrile seizures<symptom>) with influenza<disease> B<pathogen> , but in adults with influenza<disease> A<pathogen> , only a few cases of seizures<symptom> have been reported. This case was most interesting in having both encephalitis<disease> and seizure<symptom> complicating influenza<disease> A<pathogen>. If present , neuropsychiatric manifestations may be due to ostelamivir , but encephalitis<disease> and seizures<symptom> are not among the neurologic adverse effects of ostelamivir. In adults hospitalized with influenza<disease> A<pathogen> , clinicians should be alert to the possibility of neurologic complications.
