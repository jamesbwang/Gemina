  Respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( RTIs) are responsible for over 2.8 million deaths per year worldwide with pathobiont carriage a required precursor to infection. We sought to determine carriage epidemiology for both bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens as part of a large population-based cross-sectional carriage study. Nose self-swab samples were collected in two separate time-points , May to August 2012 ( late spring/summer) and February to April 2013 ( winter/early spring). The presence of six bacterial species: S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , H.<pathogen> influenzae<disease> , M.<pathogen> catarrhalis<pathogen> , S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and N.<pathogen> meningitidis<pathogen> in addition to respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , influenza<disease> viruses A and B , rhinovirus/enterovirus , coronavirus<pathogen> , parainfluenza viruses 1-3 and adenovirus<pathogen> was determined using culture and PCR methods.Results/ Key findings. Carriage was shown to vary with age , recent RTI and the presence of other species. Spatial structures of microbial communities were more disordered in the 0-4 age group and those with recent RTI. Species frequency distributions were flatter than random expectation in young individuals ( X The application of epidemiological methods and ecological theory to respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> samples has yielded novel insights into the factors that drive microbial community composition.
