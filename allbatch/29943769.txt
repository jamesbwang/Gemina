  In cancer patients treated with radiotherapy to the abdominopelvic region , dietary modifications and the use of functional foods ( fortified food with added ingredients to provide specific health improving benefits , such as antioxidants , omega-3 fatty acids , and glutamine) , may contribute to the improvement of the toxic effects of treatment , including nausea<symptom> , diarrhea<disease> , and constipation<symptom> , among others. With the aim of analyzing which coadjuvant foods benefit these patients , scientific evidence was gathered by a group of experts. For these patients , the authors recommend a diet that includes sufficient foods rich in antioxidants and polyphenols instead of supplements. Docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids have proven useful for the management of anorexia/cachexia in pancreatic cancer patients. Probiotics composed of Lactobacillus<pathogen> spp. and Bifidobacterium<pathogen> spp. are regarded as safe even in patients with neutropenia and have been proven to decrease gastrointestinal symptoms. Several factors should be considered before probiotic supplementation , these include the stage of the disease , radiation dose , and symptomatology of each patient. There is no demonstrated clear benefit to the use of glutamine , so it is not recommended due to its high cost.
