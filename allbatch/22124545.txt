  Abatacept is a fusion protein composed of the fragment crystallizable region ( Fc region) of the immunoglobulin IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4. Our patient presented with lower extremity purpura in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> and common variable immunodeficiency<disease> disease<disease>. A biopsy of cutaneous lesions<symptom> confirmed the etiology of rheumatoid vasculitis. Although rituximab is the recommended treatment , it has the potential to exacerbate immunodeficiency. The cutaneous lesions<symptom> responded well to abatacept after failure to respond to other treatment modalities. This case is the first , to our knowledge , to be reported in North<pathogen> America. Our case may encourage extensive clinical trials on abatacept as a treatment option.
