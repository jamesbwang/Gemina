  Dengue<disease> fever<disease> , a mosquito-borne disease commonly found in the tropics , is one of the most prevalent forms of Flavivirus<pathogen> infection in humans. Symptomatically , it is characterized by fever<disease> , arthralgia , headache<symptom> , and rash<symptom>. Ophthalmic manifestations can involve both the anterior and posterior segment. Panophthalmitis is rare in dengue<disease> hemorrhagic<disease> fever<disease> , and there is no report of culture-positive panophthalmitis in this setting. Here , we report a case of a serology-positive 33-year-old male patient of dengue<disease> hemorrhagic<disease> fever<disease> who developed sudden onset pain , redness , and proptosis in the right eye. The patient subsequently developed panophthalmitis in his right eye , and Bacillus<pathogen> cereus<pathogen> was isolated from eviscerated sample. This case provides unique insights into pathogenesis of panophthalmitis in dengue<disease> and highlights the management options.
