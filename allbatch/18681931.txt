  Dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection in humans can lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations , from mild<symptom> fever<symptom> to potentially fatal dengue shock<symptom> syndrome<disease>. The incidence of dengue<disease> fever<disease> is on the rise in tropical countries. Due to the increasing incidence of dengue<disease> fever<disease> worldwide , atypical manifestations of the disease are increasingly reported. In this article we report a patient with dengue haemorrhagic fever<disease> who presented with reversible splenial lesion<symptom> syndrome<disease>. A 24-year-old Sri Lankan man who presented with fever<disease> and confusion<symptom> was eventually diagnosed to have reversible splenial lesion<symptom> syndrome<disease> based on brain imaging. Clinical , serological and haematological parameters confirmed a diagnosis of dengue haemorrhagic fever<disease> His presentation , assessment , and management are described in this case report. Reversible splenial lesion<symptom> syndrome<disease> is a condition which is radiologically characterized by reversible lesion<symptom> in the splenium of the corpus callosum. It is associated with infectious and non-infectious aetiologies. This case report highlights the occurrence of reversible splenial lesion<symptom> syndrome<disease> as a presenting feature of the expanding list of unusual neurological manifestations of dengue infection.
