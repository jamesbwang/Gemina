  To analyze the infection characteristics of sputum<symptom> and venous blood pathogen in the patients with hematological malignancies and respiratory<symptom> symptom<symptom> in the Hematology Department in tropical region and to investigate its drug-resistance so as to provide etiological evidence for clinical treatment. The pathogens and their drug-resistance of 2466 samples in the patients with hematological malignancies and respiratory<symptom> symptom<symptom> in the Department were analyzed retrospectively from January 2013 to November 2017. The samples were collected from sputum<symptom> and venous blood. The sputum<symptom> sample culture in patients with hematologic diseases showed that 224 strains were isolated , out of them 98 strains ( 43.75 %) were fungi<pathogen> mainly candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> ( 41 strains); and then 88 Gram-negative strains ( 39.28 %) , among them the main pathogenic bacteria were Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( 22 strains) and klebsiella<pathogen> Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 12 strains); and then 38 Gram-positive strains ( 16.96 %) , among them the main pathogeni-bacteria were Enteroccocus ( 14 strains) and Gram-positive bacilli ( 14 strains). The blood samples culture of patients with hematologic diseases showed that 61 strains were isolated , out of them the isolated rate of Gram-positive bactetia was higherst , which accounted for 55.74 % ( 34/61) , mainly including staphylococcus<pathogen> lominis ( 19 strains); and the isolated rate of Gram-negative bacteria was 44.26 % ( 27/61) , among them main pathogenic bacteria was Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 12 strains). The resistance test of pathogenic bacteria to drugs showed that the resistant rate of Gram-negative bacteria to tigecycline , imipenem and atl-962 duenner was lowest , while the Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus<pathogen> , Gram-positive bacilli and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> were sensitive to vancomycin , tigecycline and linezolid was high. the patients in hematology department are infected easily in the hospital in tropical region. The main pathogens are fungal strains in the respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> of patients with hematological malignancy according to the sputum<symptom> culture results. The clinician in tropical regions should choose suitable antibiotics for anti-infective therapy , which is different from the situation in North China or other northern areas.
