 The factors influencing the grade of knee osteoarthritis were screened by ordered Logistic<ORGANIZATION> regression analysis. The classification model of knee osteoarthritis was established, which provided tool for the evaluation of clinical classification of knee osteoarthritis. A total of 753 cases of knee osteoarthritis from Wangjing Hospital<ORGANIZATION>, China<GPE> Academy of Chinese<GPE> Medical Sciences<ORGANIZATION> were treated with single factor and multivariate Logistic<ORGANIZATION> regression analysis from September 18, 2014 to April 26, 2016. The model formula was constructed and evaluated. In this study, it was found that 13 factors associated with knee osteoarthritis grading. Old age, obesity, long course of disease, recurrence, lower limb deformity, quadriceps muscle atrophy, WOMAC<ORGANIZATION> index, TCM<ORGANIZATION> syndrome score, VAS<ORGANIZATION> score and grading degree were positively correlated. One knee pain, limited pain range, knee activity and grading degree were negatively correlated. The knee osteoarthritis grading model was constructed and the evaluation test was effective ( Training set AUC=0.860, test set AUC=0.879 ). In this study, a classification model of knee osteoarthritis was established which has a good ability to predict the classification of knee osteoarthritis under preliminary evaluation.
