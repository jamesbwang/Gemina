 Rotational thromboelastometry ( ROTEM<ORGANIZATION> ) can provide clinical information in 10-20 minutes for guiding administration of fibrinogen, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma products. While ROTEM<ORGANIZATION> testing is well established for cardiac and other surgeries, it is less characterized for use in postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. We wanted to determine if the earlier-measured ROTEM<ORGANIZATION> parameters ( α-angle and amplitude at 10 minutes [ A10 ] ) could replace the later parameters ( amplitude at 20 minutes and maximum amplitude [ maximum clot firmness { MCF<ORGANIZATION> } ] ) in all patient groups studied. We also correlated the A10<ORGANIZATION> and α-angle of the EXTEM<ORGANIZATION> and FIBTEM<ORGANIZATION> tests to the fibrinogen levels and platelet counts in these patients. We retrospectively analyzed 100 sets of EXTEM<ORGANIZATION> and FIBTEM<ORGANIZATION> results ordered on patients undergoing operations for PPH<ORGANIZATION>, patients in intensive care units ( ICU<ORGANIZATION> ), and those undergoing cardiothoracic surgery ( cardiothoracic operating room [ C/T OR ] ). We determined if the correlations among the various parameters were similar among the PPH<ORGANIZATION>, ICU<ORGANIZATION>, and C/T OR patients. As expected, the EXTEM A10<ORGANIZATION> ( A10EX<ORGANIZATION> ) and FIBTEM A10<ORGANIZATION> ( A10FIB<ORGANIZATION> ) correlated highly to the EXTEM<ORGANIZATION> MCF and FIBTEM<ORGANIZATION> MCF in all patient groups. The A10EX<ORGANIZATION> parameter correlated significantly to both fibrinogen and platelet levels, and the A10FIB<ORGANIZATION> correlated to the fibrinogen levels. The difference between the A10EX<ORGANIZATION> and the A10FIB<ORGANIZATION> ( PLTEM<ORGANIZATION> ) is related to platelet activity, and we found that the PLTEM<ORGANIZATION> and platelet count correlated highly for all 100 PPH patients ( r = 0.80 ), C/T OR patients ( r = 0.70 ), and ICU<ORGANIZATION> patients ( r = 0.66 ), despite 4 high platelet counts with relatively low PLTEM<ORGANIZATION> values in the ICU<ORGANIZATION> group. The earlier-reported parameter EXTEM<ORGANIZATION> α angle ( α-EX ) is an excellent indicator of the A10EX<ORGANIZATION>, with an α-EX ≥65° ( ie, normal ) giving a > 96 % probability that the A10EX<ORGANIZATION> was ≥44 mm, and an α-EX value below 65 mm giving an 86 % probability that the A10EX<ORGANIZATION> was < 44 mm. The correlations among the ROTEM<ORGANIZATION> parameters for the PPH<ORGANIZATION> comparisons were equivalent to the C/T OR patients studied, and the A10EX<ORGANIZATION> and A10FIB<ORGANIZATION> could replace the MCF<ORGANIZATION> results in all patient groups. Also, the α-EX was an early indicator of the A10EX<ORGANIZATION> and had good correlations to the A10FIB<ORGANIZATION> and the fibrinogen in all patient groups. Finally, in a separate group of 62 comparisons, the FIBTEM<ORGANIZATION> α angle showed promise as an early indicator of the A10FIB<ORGANIZATION> and the fibrinogen levels.
