 14-3-3s are phospho-binding proteins with scaffolding activity that play central roles in the regulation of enzymes and signaling complexes in eukaryotes. In plants, 14-3-3 isoforms are required for disease resistance and key targets of pathogen effectors. Here, we examined the requirement of the tomato ( Solanum<ORGANIZATION> lycopersicum ) 14-3-3 ( TFT<ORGANIZATION> ) protein family for Xv3<ORGANIZATION> disease resistance in response to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas euvesicatoria. In addition, we determined if tomato 14-3-3 proteins interact with the repertoire of X. euvesicatoria type III<ORGANIZATION> secretion effector proteins, including AvrXv3 the elicitor of Xv3<GPE> resistance. We show that multiple tomato 14-3-3 isoforms contribute to Xv3 resistance. We also show that one or more tomato 14-3-3s physically interact with multiple effectors ( AvrXv3<ORGANIZATION>, XopE1<ORGANIZATION>, XopE2<ORGANIZATION>, XopN<ORGANIZATION>, XopO<ORGANIZATION>, XopQ<ORGANIZATION>, and XopAU<ORGANIZATION> ). Genetic analyses indicate that none of the identified effectors interfere with AvrXv3-elicited resistance into Xv3<GPE> tomato leaves ; however, XopE1<ORGANIZATION>, XopE2<ORGANIZATION> and XopO<ORGANIZATION> are required to suppress symptom development in susceptible tomato leaves. Phospho-peptide mapping revealed that XopE2<ORGANIZATION> is phosphorylated at multiple residues in planta and residues T66<PERSON>, T131<PERSON> and S334 are required for maximal binding to TFT10<ORGANIZATION>. Together, our data support the hypothesis that multiple tomato 14-3-3 isoforms are involved in immune signaling during X. euvesicatoria infection.
