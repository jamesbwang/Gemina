 Heightened response to drug-related cues is a hallmark of addiction. Extended-release naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) is a US Food<ORGANIZATION> and Drug<PERSON> Administration-approved pharmacotherapy for relapse prevention in patients with opioid use disorder ( OUD<ORGANIZATION> ). In these patients, XR-NTX has been shown to reduce brain responses to opioid-related visual stimuli. To assess the biomarker potential of this phenomenon, it is necessary to determine whether this effect is limited to opioid-related stimuli and whether it is associated with key OUD<ORGANIZATION> symptoms. Using functional MRI<ORGANIZATION> ( fMRI<ORGANIZATION> ), we measured the brain responses to opioid-related and control ( i.e., sexual and aversive ) images in detoxified patients with OUD<ORGANIZATION> before, during and after XR-NTX treatment. Craving and withdrawal severity were evaluated using clinician- and self-administered instruments during each session. We included 24 patients with OUD<ORGANIZATION> in our analysis. During XR-NTX treatment, we found reduced responses to opioid-related stimuli in the nucleus accumbens ( NAcc<ORGANIZATION> ) and medial orbitofrontal cortex ( mOFC<ORGANIZATION> ). The reduction in mOFC<ORGANIZATION> response was specific to the opioid-related stimuli. The reduced NAcc<ORGANIZATION> and mOFC opioid cue reactivity was correlated with reduction in clinician-assessed and self-reported withdrawal symptoms, respectively. The study was not placebo-controlled owing to ethical, safety and feasibility concerns. Extended-release naltrexone reduces the NAcc<ORGANIZATION> and mOFC cue reactivity in patients with OUD<ORGANIZATION>. This effect is specific to opioid-related stimuli in the mOFC<ORGANIZATION> only. The reduction in neural response to opioid-related stimuli is more robust in patients with greater decline in withdrawal severity. Our results support the clinical utility of mesocorticolimbic cue reactivity in monitoring the XR-NTX treatment outcomes and highlight the link between opioid withdrawal symptomatology and neural opioid cue reactivity.
