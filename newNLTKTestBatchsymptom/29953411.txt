 Background The approach to the clinical management of Graves<ORGANIZATION> ' disease ( GD ) is debatable. This study aimed to identify predictors of remission in pediatric GD. Methods A longitudinal study of 36 children and adolescents with GD<ORGANIZATION> followed from 1997 to 2017 at a single tertiary hospital was performed. Clinical<PERSON> and biochemical parameters, including comorbidities, treatment with anti-thyroid drugs ( ATD<ORGANIZATION> ) or definitive therapy ( radioiodine [ RIT ] and thyroidectomy ), and remission as the main outcome were collected. We performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify likely predictors of remission. Results<PERSON> Among patients, most were female, in late puberty, with exuberant symptoms at onset. Eleven<PERSON> also suffered from Down<GPE> syndrome ( DS ). Thirty-four patients ( 94 % ) started on methimazole from disease onset, and 25 ( 69 % ) received it as the only therapy, with a mean duration of 2.7±1.8 years. Six<PERSON> changed to RIT<ORGANIZATION> and three underwent thyroidectomy ; no DS patient received definitive therapy. Remission<PERSON> was higher in DS patients ( 45 % vs. 25 %, p=0.24 ), but afterwards ( 3.9±2.5 vs. 2.3±1.4 years, p < 0.05 ) ; there was no significance in relapsing ( 20 % vs. 15 % ). Females were less likely to reach remission ( p < 0.05 ) ; serum free thyroxine at onset was higher ( p < 0.05 ) in patients who required definitive therapy. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin ( TSI<ORGANIZATION> ) values normalized in exclusively ATD<ORGANIZATION> therapy, especially from 2 years on ( p < 0.05 ). Conclusions Males<PERSON> were more likely to achieve remission. TSI values may normalize in GD<GPE>, notably from the second year of treatment. DS children may benefit with conservative management in GD.
