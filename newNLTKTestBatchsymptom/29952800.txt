 Long-term treatment with benzodiazepines ( BZD<ORGANIZATION> ) should be avoided in dementia patients because of an increased risk of adverse events. We evaluated how continuously dementia patients were prescribed BZD<ORGANIZATION> over 12 months. For this observational study, we used claims data from a large German<GPE> public sickness fund for 2014 and 2015, including patients with an incident diagnosis of dementia in 2014. The aim was to evaluate the continuity of treatment, the frequency of BZD<ORGANIZATION> prescriptions and defined daily doses were evaluated. In total, 1298 ( 5.6 % ) patients received 4.7Â±5.2 BZD prescriptions in 2015 on average. Thereof, lorazepam ( 47.5 % ), oxazepam ( 18.6 % ), diazepam ( 14.5 % ), and bromazepam ( 12.2 % ) were most often prescribed. 30.7 % of the patients received at least one BZD prescription in each quarter of 2015. Although the total number of patients receiving BZD<ORGANIZATION> decreased in 2015, defined daily doses for single substances remained mainly unchanged. The incident diagnosis of dementia was not associated with modifications of prescription behavior. The treatment with BZD<ORGANIZATION> was not discontinued in a large proportion of dementia patients, increasing the risk of adverse events. Physicians ' awareness of avoiding BZD<ORGANIZATION> should be improved and further evidence for the appropriate treatment of psychiatric symptoms in dementia ( e.g. sleep disturbances, anxiety ) is required.
