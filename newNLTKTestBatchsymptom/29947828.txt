 The study investigated the association between socio-economic status ( SES<ORGANIZATION> ) and self-reported chronic disease ( CD ) among the Palestinian<GPE> population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory<ORGANIZATION>, and whether this association was similar in the refugee camps. We used data from representative samples in 2006 and 2010 collected by the Palestinian<GPE> Central Bureau<ORGANIZATION> of Statistics<ORGANIZATION>. SES<ORGANIZATION> was defined by education, wealth and employment status. Associations between SES<ORGANIZATION> and CD were analysed and stratified by living in or outside refugee camps. CD prevalence increased among men and decreased among women in all SES categories and the Odds Ratio<ORGANIZATION> for CD<ORGANIZATION> was higher inside than outside the refugee camps, except for women in 2006. In both 2006 and 2010 the odds ratio of CD<ORGANIZATION> was higher among the lowest SES<ORGANIZATION> groups. The pattern of the negative association between SES<ORGANIZATION> and CD<ORGANIZATION> was similar in and outside the refugee camps. We found that the highest burden of CD<ORGANIZATION> is among those with low SES. In spite of a higher CD Odds Ratio<PERSON> in the refugee camps, the pattern of association between SES<ORGANIZATION> and CD<ORGANIZATION> did not differ in the refugee camps.
