 The Self-Efficacy Measure for Sleep Apnea<PERSON> ( SEMSA<ORGANIZATION> ) is a 26-item self-questionnaire composed of three factors: risk perception of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS<ORGANIZATION> ), benefit of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP<ORGANIZATION> ), and self-efficacy ( the confidence to engage in CPAP<GPE> use ). It is used to evaluate health beliefs about OSAS<ORGANIZATION> and CPAP<ORGANIZATION> in order to optimize CPAP<ORGANIZATION> use. The purpose of this study was to design and validate a French<GPE> version of the SEMSA<ORGANIZATION>. A forward-backward translation of the SEMSA<ORGANIZATION> was performed. Subjects with OSAS<ORGANIZATION> treated by CPAP<ORGANIZATION> and followed by our sleep clinic were invited to complete the questionnaire. The psychometric properties of the French<GPE> SEMSA<ORGANIZATION> version were analyzed in terms of its construct validity ( with confirmatory factor analysis, CFA<ORGANIZATION> ), internal structural validity ( Cronbach<ORGANIZATION> 's alpha coefficient ), and external validity ( Pearson<PERSON> 's correlation between SEMSA<ORGANIZATION> score and duration of CPAP<ORGANIZATION> use ). Two hundred eighty-eight subjects filled in the questionnaire. The mean age was 63.16 ± 12.73 years. The number of years since the beginning of CPAP<ORGANIZATION> treatment was 6.58 ± 6.03 years. The mean CPAP<ORGANIZATION> use duration was 6.19 ± 2.03 h/night. CFA<ORGANIZATION> was unsatisfactory ( RMSEA<ORGANIZATION> = 0.066 and CFI<ORGANIZATION> = 0.88 ). The exploratory factor analysis revealed a fourth factor named `` cardiovascular risk '' factor. Cronbach<PERSON> 's alpha coefficient was 0.886. The correlation between the `` self-efficacy '' factor and the duration of CPAP<ORGANIZATION> use was significant ( r = 0.26, p ≤ 0.001 ). The French<GPE> version of the SEMSA<ORGANIZATION> is a psychometrically acceptable self-report questionnaire for measuring health beliefs and behavior in French<GPE> patients with OSAS<ORGANIZATION> treated with CPAP<ORGANIZATION>. Such translation and validation should lead to the adoption of validated psychosocial methods for improving CPAP<ORGANIZATION> use.
