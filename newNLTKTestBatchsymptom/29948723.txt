 Little<GPE> was known about the arsenic metabolism and arsenic methylation associated with the changes of skin lesions after reducing the arsenic in drinking water ( WAs<ORGANIZATION> ). Therefore, urinary concentrations and proportions of arsenic species were determined for recovery ( RC ), improvement ( IC ), persistent ( PE ), aggravation ( AC<ORGANIZATION> ), new incidence ( NC ), and no sign ( HC ) groups based on the changes of skin lesions between before ( in 2004 ) and after ( in 2017 ) WAs<ORGANIZATION> reduction. The results indicate that the urinary concentrations of inorganic arsenic ( iAs<ORGANIZATION> ), monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA<ORGANIZATION> ), dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA<ORGANIZATION> ), and total arsenic ( TAs<ORGANIZATION> ) were much higher for RC<ORGANIZATION> and IC<ORGANIZATION> groups than for the other groups in 2004, while these values varied slightly among the groups in 2017. The urinary % iAs<ORGANIZATION> of all the groups was significantly decreased after WAs<ORGANIZATION> reduction. In contrast, the urinary % DMA<ORGANIZATION> of RC<ORGANIZATION>, IC<ORGANIZATION>, AC<ORGANIZATION>, and NC<ORGANIZATION> groups was increased. From 2004 to 2017, the PE<ORGANIZATION> and HC<ORGANIZATION> groups had lower decrease rate of % iAs<ORGANIZATION> and % MMA<ORGANIZATION>, and increase rate of % DMA<ORGANIZATION>, primary methylation index ( PMI<ORGANIZATION> ), and secondary methylation index ( SMI<ORGANIZATION> ) after WAs<ORGANIZATION> reduction. The adjusted odd ratios ( ORs<ORGANIZATION> ) showed that the RC<ORGANIZATION>, IC<ORGANIZATION>, AC<ORGANIZATION>, and NC<ORGANIZATION> groups were positively related with % iAs<ORGANIZATION> and % MMA<ORGANIZATION> and were negatively correlated with % DMA<ORGANIZATION>, PMI<ORGANIZATION>, and SMI<ORGANIZATION> before WAs<ORGANIZATION> reduction. It can be concluded that higher urinary % iAs<ORGANIZATION> and % MMA<ORGANIZATION> before WAs<ORGANIZATION> reduction increased the probability of skin lesions recovery and improvement, and the risks of skin lesions aggravation and incidence. Higher increase rate of urinary % DMA<ORGANIZATION> was positively associated with of skin lesions recovery and improvement. Moreover, higher urinary % iAs<ORGANIZATION> and % MMA<ORGANIZATION> or lower increase rate of urinary % DMA<ORGANIZATION> might increase the risk of skin lesions aggravation.
