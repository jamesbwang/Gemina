 Children<GPE> with solitary functioning kidney ( SFK<ORGANIZATION> ) are prone to develop long term problems, which are not well represented in the literature. The extent to which the presence of associated congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract ( CAKUT<ORGANIZATION> ) further de-stabilize renal function is to be addressed. This study was conducted to evaluate the etiology, presentation, presence of CAKUT<ORGANIZATION>, and renal damage in children with SFK<ORGANIZATION>. All children with SFK<ORGANIZATION> who presented to the department of pediatric surgery from March 2014 to May 2016 were included in the study. Children with malignancy were excluded from the study. Of the 20 patients with SFK<ORGANIZATION>, 14 ( 70 % ) had primary SFK<ORGANIZATION> ( 8 with agenesis and 6 with multicystic dysplastic kidney ), 6 ( 30 % ) belonged to secondary SFK<ORGANIZATION> group, among them 3 had pelviureteric junction obstruction, 2 had posterior urethral valves and 1 had vesicoureteric reflux. Eight ( 40 % ) had associated CAKUT<ORGANIZATION>, 4 ( 20 % ) were asymptomatic while 8 ( 40 % ) had UTI<ORGANIZATION> and 6 ( 30 % ) had hypertension. Ten ( 50 % ) patients had reduced glomerular filtration rate ( GFR<ORGANIZATION> ) suggesting compromised renal function. Children with SFK<ORGANIZATION> have high morbidity especially when associated with ipsilateral CAKUT<ORGANIZATION>. Long-term periodical follow up is essential in these patients to improve clinical outcome.
