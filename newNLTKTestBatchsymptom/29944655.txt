 Medicare<PERSON> Advantage ( MA ) and Medicare<ORGANIZATION> fee-for-service ( FFS<ORGANIZATION> ) plans have different financial incentives. Medicare<PERSON> pays predetermined rates per beneficiary to MA<ORGANIZATION> plans for providing care throughout the year, while providers serving FFS<ORGANIZATION> patients are reimbursed per utilization event. It is unknown how these incentives affect post-acute care in skilled nursing facilities ( SNFs<ORGANIZATION> ). The objective of this study was to examine differences in rehabilitation service use, length of stay, and outcomes for patients following hip fracture between FFS<ORGANIZATION> and MA<ORGANIZATION> enrollees. This was a retrospective cohort study to examine differences in health service utilization and outcomes between FFS<ORGANIZATION> and MA<ORGANIZATION> patients in SNFs<ORGANIZATION> following hip fracture hospitalization during the period January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2015, and followed up until December 31, 2015. We linked the Master<ORGANIZATION> Beneficiary Summary File, Medicare<ORGANIZATION> Provider and Analysis Review<PERSON> data, Healthcare Effectiveness Data<PERSON> and Information Set<ORGANIZATION> data, the Minimum Data Set<ORGANIZATION>, and the American<ORGANIZATION> Community Survey. The 6 primary outcomes of interest in this study included 2 process measures and 4 patient-centered outcomes. Process measures included length of stay in the SNF<ORGANIZATION> and average rehabilitation therapy minutes ( physical and occupational therapy ) received per day. Patient-centered outcomes included 30-day hospital readmission, changes in functional status as measured by the 28-point late loss MDS-ADL scale, likelihood of becoming a long-term resident, and successful discharge to the community. Successful discharge from a SNF<ORGANIZATION> was defined as being discharged to the community within 100 days of SNF<ORGANIZATION> admission and remaining alive in the community without being institutionalized in any acute or post-acute setting for at least 30 days. We analyzed 211,296 FFS<ORGANIZATION> and 75,554 MA patients with hip fracture admitted directly to a SNF following an index hospitalization who had not been in a nursing facility or hospital in the preceding year. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting ( IPTW<ORGANIZATION> ) and nursing facility fixed effects regression models to compare treatments and outcomes between MA<ORGANIZATION> and FFS<ORGANIZATION> patients. MA patients were younger and less cognitively impaired upon SNF<ORGANIZATION> admission than FFS<ORGANIZATION> patients. After applying IPTW<ORGANIZATION>, demographic and clinical characteristics of MA<ORGANIZATION> patients were comparable with those of FFS<ORGANIZATION> patients. After adjusting for risk factors using IPTW-weighted fixed effects regression models, MA<ORGANIZATION> patients spent 5.1 ( 95 % CI -5.4 to -4.8 ) fewer days in the SNF<ORGANIZATION> and received 463 ( 95 % CI to -483.2 to -442.4 ) fewer minutes of total rehabilitation therapy during the first 40 days following SNF<ORGANIZATION> admission, i.e., 12.1 ( 95 % CI -12.7 to -11.4 ) fewer minutes of rehabilitation therapy per day compared to FFS<ORGANIZATION> patients. In addition, MA<ORGANIZATION> patients had a 1.2 percentage point ( 95 % CI -1.5 to -1.1 ) lower 30-day readmission rate, 0.6 percentage point ( 95 % CI -0.8 to -0.3 ) lower rate of becoming a long-stay resident, and a 3.2 percentage point ( 95 % CI 2.7 to 3.7 ) higher rate of successful discharge to the community compared to FFS<ORGANIZATION> patients. The major limitation of this study was that we only adjusted for observed differences to address selection bias between FFS<ORGANIZATION> and MA<ORGANIZATION> patients with hip fracture. Therefore, results may not be generalizable to other conditions requiring extensive rehabilitation. Compared to FFS<ORGANIZATION> patients, MA<ORGANIZATION> patients had a shorter course of rehabilitation but were more likely to be discharged to the community successfully and were less likely to experience a 30-day hospital readmission. Longer lengths of stay may not translate into better outcomes in the case of hip fracture patients in SNFs<GPE>.
