 Severe<GPE> sepsis and septic shock are among the leading causes of death globally. Despite the central role the emergency department ( ED ) plays in the early identification of patients presenting to hospital with sepsis, the prevalence of severe sepsis and septic shock in the Irish<GPE> ED setting has not been described. The primary aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of severe sepsis or septic shock in an Irish<GPE> adult ED setting. The clinical records of patients presenting to the ED<ORGANIZATION> over a four-week period were retrospectively reviewed to determine if they met the current Health Service<ORGANIZATION> Executive ( HSE<ORGANIZATION> ) criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 3,585 adult patients attended the ED<ORGANIZATION> during the study period, with 42 patients meeting the criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock. The ED<ORGANIZATION> prevalence of severe sepsis or septic shock was 11.7 patients ( 95 % CI 8.1 - 15.4 % ) per 1000 ED attendances.
