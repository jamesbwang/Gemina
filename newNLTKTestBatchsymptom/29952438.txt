 Ongoing investigation is needed into feasible approaches which reduce excess weight in childhood. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an adapted version of the Scottish Childhood Overweight<ORGANIZATION> Treatment Trial ( SCOTT<ORGANIZATION> ) in an Irish<GPE> primary care setting. Families were offered monthly dietitian-led sessions for six months. These sessions targeted dietary habits, family meals, screen time and exercise. Of the 95 children ( mean age 7.6 years ) referred, 90.5 % ( n86 ) were obese and 9.5 % ( n9 ) were overweight. Fifty-one ( 53.7 % ) families opted into the programme from referral, and 18 completed the programme ( 64.7 % attrition ). Statistically significant reductions in body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ) were observed between sessions one and six ( 25.7±4.2kg/m2 and 25.3±4.8kg/m2, respectively, p < 0.01 ). BMI<ORGANIZATION> z-score modestly decreased by 0.2 ( p=0.01 ). Despite these reductions, issues with programme referral, attrition and long-term effectiveness were evident. Further investigation into strategies which reduce paediatric overweight is warranted.
