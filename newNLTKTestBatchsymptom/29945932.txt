 Atypical<GPE> dopamine transporter ( DAT<ORGANIZATION> ) inhibitors, despite high DAT<ORGANIZATION> affinity, do not produce the psychomotor stimulant and abuse profile of standard DAT<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors such as cocaine. Proposed contributing features for those differences include off-target actions, slow onsets of action, and ligand bias regarding DAT<ORGANIZATION> conformation. Several 3Î±- ( 4',4 '' -difluoro-diphenylmethoxy ) tropanes were examined, including those with the following substitutions: N- ( indole-3 '' -ethyl ) - ( GA1-69 ), N- ( R ) -2 '' -amino-3 '' -methyl-n-butyl- ( GA2-50 ), N-2 '' aminoethyl- ( GA2-99 ), and N- ( cyclopropylmethyl ) - ( JHW013<ORGANIZATION> ). These compounds were previously reported to have rapid onset of behavioral effects and were presently evaluated pharmacologically, alone or in combination with cocaine. DAT<ORGANIZATION> conformational mode was assessed by substituted-cysteine accessibility and molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations. As determined by substituted-cysteine alkylation, all BZT analogs except GA2-99 showed bias for a cytoplasmic-facing DAT<ORGANIZATION> conformation, whereas cocaine stabilized the extracellular-facing conformation. MD simulations suggested that several analog-DAT complexes formed stable R85-D476 `` outer gate '' bonds that close the DAT<ORGANIZATION> to extracellular space. GA2-99 diverged from this pattern, yet had effects similar to those of other atypical DAT<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors. Apparent DAT<PERSON> association rates of the BZT<ORGANIZATION> analogs in vivo were slower than that for cocaine. None of the compounds was self-administered or stimulated locomotion, and each blocked those effects of cocaine. The present findings provide more detail on ligand-induced DAT<ORGANIZATION> conformations, and indicate that aspects of DAT<ORGANIZATION> conformation besides `` open '' versus `` closed '' may facilitate predictions of the actions of DAT<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors and may promote rational design of potential treatments for psychomotor-stimulant abuse.
