 We report a rare case of unexpected gross hyphema in the right eye ( OD ) and eight-ball hyphema in the left eye ( OS ) from a bilateral laser iridotomy in an acute primary angle-closure patient. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of the inferior full-thickness trabeculectomy with daily intracameral air injection as an alternative treatment in eight-ball hyphema. An 81-year-old Thai<GPE> female presented with gross hyphema grade II OD and eight-ball hyphema with blood-stained cornea OS after laser iridotomy. The patient was scheduled for surgery and the preoperative blood test showed bicytopenia. We performed anterior chamber washout OD<ORGANIZATION> and an inferior full-thickness trabeculectomy with daily intracameral air injection OS. The hyphema completely resolved on the following day OD and 3 days after surgery OS. The inferior bleb OS did not raise with digital pressure and became nonfunctional in 7 days. No recurrent hyphema was found in both eyes ( OU ) during 6 months of follow-up. This patient was ultimately diagnosed with hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS<ORGANIZATION> ). Gross<PERSON> hyphema after laser iridotomy can be seen in patients with hypocellular MDS<ORGANIZATION>. The inferior full-thickness trabeculectomy is an alternative surgical procedure for an eight-ball hyphema.
