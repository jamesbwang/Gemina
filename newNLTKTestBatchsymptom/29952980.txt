 To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dry needling ( DN ) for treating low back pain ( LBP<ORGANIZATION> ). Nine databases were searched from inception to October 2017. Eligible randomized controlled trials ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) involving DN<ORGANIZATION> for treating LBP<ORGANIZATION> were retrieved. Two reviewers independently screened the articles, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias among the included studies using the risk of bias assessment tool by Cochrane Collaboration<PERSON>. Sixteen RCTs<PERSON> were included and the risk of bias assessment of them was `` high '' or `` unclear '' for most domains. Meta-analysis results suggested that DN<ORGANIZATION> was more effective than acupuncture in alleviating pain intensity and functional disability at postintervention, while its efficacy on pain and disability at follow-up was only equal to acupuncture. Besides, DN<ORGANIZATION> was superior to sham needling for alleviating pain intensity at postintervention/follow-up and functional disability at postintervention. Additionally, qualitative review revealed that DN<ORGANIZATION> combined with acupuncture had more significant effect on alleviating pain intensity at postintervention and achieved higher response rate than DN alone. However, compared with other treatments ( laser, physical therapy, other combined treatments, etc. ), it remained uncertain whether the efficacy of DN<ORGANIZATION> was superior or equal because the results of included studies were mixed. Compared with acupuncture and sham needling, DN<ORGANIZATION> is more effective for alleviating pain and disability at postintervention in LBP<ORGANIZATION>, while its effectiveness on pain and disability at follow-up was equal to acupuncture. Besides, it remains uncertain whether the efficacy of DN<ORGANIZATION> is superior to other treatments. Nevertheless, considering the overall `` high '' or `` unclear '' risk of bias of studies, all current evidence is not robust to draw a firm conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of DN<ORGANIZATION> for LBP<ORGANIZATION>. Future RCTs<PERSON> with rigorous methodologies are required to confirm our findings. No ethical approval was required for this systematic review and meta-analysis.
