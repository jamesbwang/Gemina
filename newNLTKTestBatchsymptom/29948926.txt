 Therapies may be more efficacious when targeting a patient subpopulation with specific attributes, thereby enhancing the cost-effectiveness of treatment. In the CRYSTAL<ORGANIZATION> study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC<ORGANIZATION> ) were treated with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI<ORGANIZATION> or FOLFIRI<ORGANIZATION> alone until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects or withdrawal of consent. To determine if stratified use of cetuximab based on genetic biomarker detection improves cost-effectiveness. We used individual patient data from CRYSTAL<ORGANIZATION> to compare the cost-effectiveness, cost per life-year ( LY ) and cost per quality-adjusted LY ( QALY<ORGANIZATION> ) gained of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI<ORGANIZATION> versus FOLFIRI<ORGANIZATION> alone in three cohorts of patients with mCRC: all randomised patients ( intent-to-treat ; ITT ), tumours with no detectable mutations in codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 of the KRAS<ORGANIZATION> protein ( 'KRAS wt ' ) and no detectable mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 of KRAS<ORGANIZATION> and exons 2, 3 and 4 of NRAS<ORGANIZATION> ( 'RAS wt ' ). Survival analysis was conducted using RStudio<ORGANIZATION>, and a cost-utility model was modified to allow comparison of the three cohorts. The deterministic base-case ICER<ORGANIZATION> ( cost per QALY<ORGANIZATION> gained ) was £130,929 in the ITT<ORGANIZATION>, £72,053 in the KRAS<ORGANIZATION> wt and £44,185 in the RAS<ORGANIZATION> wt cohorts for cetuximab plus FOLFIRI<ORGANIZATION> compared with FOLFIRI<ORGANIZATION> alone. At a £50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold, cetuximab plus FOLFIRI<ORGANIZATION> has a 2.8, 20 and 63 % probability of being cost-effective for the ITT<ORGANIZATION>, KRAS<ORGANIZATION> wt and RAS<ORGANIZATION> wt cohorts, respectively, versus FOLFIRI<ORGANIZATION> alone. Screening for mutations in both KRAS<ORGANIZATION> and NRAS<ORGANIZATION> may provide the most cost-effective approach to patient selection.
