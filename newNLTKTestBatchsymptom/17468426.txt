 Giving birth is a critical time for many species and is often the most painful event ever experienced by females. In domestic species, like the pig, pain associated with parturition represents a potential welfare concern, and the consequences of pain can cause economic losses ( e.g., by indirectly contributing to piglet mortality as pain could slow post-farrowing recovery, reduce food and water intake, reducing milk let-down ). This study investigated pain assessment and its management in primiparous ( gilts ) and multiparous ( sows ) breeding pigs, including the provision of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID<ORGANIZATION> ) post-parturition. Individuals were randomly allocated to receive the NSAID<ORGANIZATION> ketoprofen ( 3 mg/kg bodyweight ) (
