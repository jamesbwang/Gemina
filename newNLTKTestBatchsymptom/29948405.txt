 The eighth edition of AJCC<ORGANIZATION> cancer staging manual incorporated biomarker status into the prognostic staging group ( PSG<ORGANIZATION> ). We used data from National Cancer Database<ORGANIZATION> ( NCDB<ORGANIZATION> ) to validate and improve the PSG<ORGANIZATION>. All patients had surgery and at least some systemic treatment ( endocrine therapy, chemotherapy or HER2<ORGANIZATION> targeted therapy ). Information from 420,520 patients was assessed for potential predictors of overall survival ( OS ), including age at diagnosis ( age ), tumor grade ( G ), hormonal receptor and HER2<ORGANIZATION> status, and presence of lymph vascular invasion ( LVI<ORGANIZATION> ), stratified by stage or sub-stages. Based on the multivariate Cox<PERSON> analyses, we built different point systems to predict OS<ORGANIZATION> and evaluated the different point systems by Akaike<PERSON> 's information criterion ( AIC<ORGANIZATION> ), Harrell<PERSON> 's concordance index ( C-index ), and Uno<PERSON> 's concordance index. Age, G<GPE>, hormonal receptor and HER2<ORGANIZATION> status, LVI<ORGANIZATION> and being TNBC<ORGANIZATION> were significantly associated with OS<ORGANIZATION> ( all P < 0.0001 ). Three staging systems were correlated with OS: system 1 was the conventional anatomic TNM<ORGANIZATION> staging ; system 2 included TNM<ORGANIZATION>, age, G<GPE>, hormonal receptor, HER2<ORGANIZATION>, and LVI<ORGANIZATION> ; system 3 included TNM<ORGANIZATION>, age, G<GPE>, TNBC<ORGANIZATION> versus non-TNBC, and LVI<ORGANIZATION>. System 3 ( C-index ; 0.7316 ; AIC: 488138.91 ) achieved the best balance between predictive performance and goodness-of-fit to the NCDB<ORGANIZATION> data as compared to system 2 ( C-index: 0.7325 ; AIC: 498087.73 ) and system 1 ( C-index: 0.716 ; AIC: 688536.49 ). The new PSG<ORGANIZATION> is a better staging system than the conventional anatomic TNM<ORGANIZATION> system. Grouping breast cancer into TNBC<ORGANIZATION> versus non-TNBC may be simpler while retaining similar accuracy as using ER/PR/HER2 status to predict OS.
