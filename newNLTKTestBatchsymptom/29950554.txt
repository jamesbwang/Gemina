 Although crizotinib is standard chemotherapy for advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK<ORGANIZATION> ) -positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ), clinical factors affecting progression-free survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to identify clinical factors affecting PFS<ORGANIZATION> of crizotinib and develop a prognostic model for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC<ORGANIZATION>. Clinicopathologic<PERSON> features of patients enrolled in PROFILE 1001, 1005, 1007, and 1014 ( training cohort ) were reviewed. We conducted multivariate Cox analysis for PFS<ORGANIZATION> and overall survival ( OS ) in the training cohort ( n = 159 ) and generated a proportional hazards model based on significant clinicopathologic factors, and then validated the model in an independent validation cohort ( n = 40 ). In the training cohort, the objective response rate was 81.5 %. Median PFS<PERSON> and OS from the start of crizotinib were 12.4 and 31.3 months, respectively. Multivariate Cox analysis showed poor performance status, number of metastatic organs ( â‰¥ 3 ), and no response to crizotinib independently associated shorter PFS<ORGANIZATION>. Based on a score derived from these three factors, median PFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS<ORGANIZATION> of patients with one or two factors were significantly shorter compared to those without these factors ( median PFS<ORGANIZATION>, 22.4 months vs. 10.5 months vs. 6.5 months ; median OS, not reached vs. 29.1 months vs. 11.8 months, respectively ; p < 0.001 for each group ). This model also had validated in an independent validation cohort. Performance status, number of metastatic organs, and response to crizotinib affected PFS<ORGANIZATION> of crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC<ORGANIZATION>. Based on these factors, we developed a simple and useful prediction model for PFS<ORGANIZATION>.
