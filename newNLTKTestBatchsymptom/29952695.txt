 Concussion management is moving from passive rest strategies to active interventions, including aerobic exercise therapy. Little information is available regarding the feasibility and adherence of these programs. To determine whether an aerobic exercise training program, intended for rehabilitation in persons with concussion, is feasible. Healthy non-concussed subjects were studied in this Phase I trial. Phase 1 parallel-group randomized controlled trial in a sample of healthy ( non-concussed ), recreationally active university students. Laboratory<PERSON>. 40 healthy, university students. Participants were equally randomized into acute concussion therapy intervention ( ACTIVE<ORGANIZATION> ) training or non-training groups. All participants completed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests ( CPETs<ORGANIZATION> ) on a stationary cycle ergometer at two test sessions approximately 14 days apart. During this 2-week study period, ACTIVE<ORGANIZATION> training participants completed six 30-minute cycling sessions, progressing from 60-80 % of the participant 's individualized maximal oxygen consumption ( VO Study<ORGANIZATION> protocol and randomization effectiveness, exercise safety and adherence, and progressive intensity of the ACTIVE<ORGANIZATION> training procedures. No adverse events occurred during any exercise sessions. Twelve<PERSON> ACTIVE training participants ( 60 % ) completed all training sessions and every participant completed at least four sessions. Heart rate increased throughout the training period ( p < 0.001 ), but symptom changes and training adherence remained stable despite the progressively increasing workload. ACTIVE training participants completed approximately 30 additional minutes of physical activity on training sessions days, although not statistically significant ( p=0.20 ). University<PERSON> aged students were adherent to the ACTIVE<ORGANIZATION> training protocol. Future<PERSON> research should investigate the safety and feasibility of aerobic training programs in acutely concussed individuals to determine their appropriateness as a clinical rehabilitation strategy.
