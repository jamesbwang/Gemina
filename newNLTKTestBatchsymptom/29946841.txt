 Ultrafiltration<GPE> ( UF ) is one of the significant advanced processes for oily wastewater treatment due to its clear advantages, for instance, ease in operation and efficient separation. The main drawback of these processes is the fouling problem and many researchers ' effort on fabrication of high-performance membranes with higher hydrophilicity and antifouling properties. In this study, flat-sheet polysulfone ( PSF<ORGANIZATION> ) /polyethylenimine ( PEI<ORGANIZATION> ) /CaCO
