 To investigate the effectiveness of a multi-facetted blended eHealth<ORGANIZATION> intervention, called SDM-Digital Intake<ORGANIZATION> ( SDM-DI ), in which patients and clinicians are supported in Shared<GPE> Decision Making during the intake process. The study is a two-arm matched-paired cluster Randomised Controlled Trial<ORGANIZATION> in a specialist mental health outpatient setting with two conditions: SDM-DI and Intake<ORGANIZATION> As Usual ( IAU<ORGANIZATION> ). Four intake teams were allocated to each arm. All patients who followed an intake, were asked to participate if they were capable to complete questionnaires. Decisional Conflict ( DC ), referring to patients ' engagement and satisfaction with clinical decisions, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were patient participation, applying Shared Decision Making<PERSON> ( SDM<ORGANIZATION> ), working alliance, treatment adherence and symptom severity. Effects were measured at two weeks ( T1 ) and two months ( T2 ) after intake. Multilevel<PERSON> regression and intention-to-treat analyses were used. Additionally, the influence of subgroups and intervention adherence on DC were explored. At T1<ORGANIZATION>, 200 patients participated ( 47 % intervention, 53 % control ), and at T2 175 patients ( 47 % intervention, 53 % control ). At T1<ORGANIZATION> and T2<GPE>, no differences were found between conditions on DC. Subgroup<PERSON> analyses showed that effects of SDM-DI on DC were not modified by primary diagnoses mood, anxiety and personality disorders. Compared to IAU<ORGANIZATION>, at T2<ORGANIZATION>, patients reported positive effects of SDM-DI on SDM<ORGANIZATION> ( β 7.553, p = 0.038, 95 % CI:0.403-14.703, d = 0.32 ) and reduction of symptoms ( β -7.276, p = 0.0497, 95 % CI: -14.544 -- 0.008, d = -0.43 ). No effects were found on patient participation, working alliance and treatment adherence. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that if SDM<ORGANIZATION> was applied well, patients reported less DC ( β = -0.457, p = 0.000, 95 % CI: -0.518 -- 0.396, d = -1.31 ), which was associated with better treatment outcomes. Although, this trial fails to demonstrate that SDM-DI by itself is sufficient to reduce DC, the results are encouraging for further efforts in improving and implementing the SDM<ORGANIZATION> intervention.
