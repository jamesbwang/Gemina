 Cardiac<GPE> ischemia/reperfusion, loss of blood flow and its subsequent restoration, causes damage to the heart. Oxidative stress from ischemia/reperfusion leads to dysfunction and death of cardiomyocytes, increasing the risk of progression to heart failure. Alterations in mitochondrial dynamics, in particular mitochondrial fission, have been suggested to play a role in cardioprotection from oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that activation of RhoA<ORGANIZATION> regulates mitochondrial fission in cardiomyocytes. Our studies show that expression of constitutively active RhoA<ORGANIZATION> in cardiomyocytes increases phosphorylation of Dynamin-related protein 1 ( Drp1<ORGANIZATION> ) at serine-616, and leads to localization of Drp1<GPE> at mitochondria. Both responses are blocked by inhibition of Rho-associated Protein Kinase ( ROCK<ORGANIZATION> ). Endogenous<PERSON> RhoA<ORGANIZATION> activation by the GPCR<ORGANIZATION> agonist sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P ) also increases Drp1<PERSON> phosphorylation and its mitochondrial translocation in a RhoA<ORGANIZATION> and ROCK<ORGANIZATION> dependent manner. Consistent with the role of mitochondrial Drp1 in fission, RhoA<ORGANIZATION> activation in cardiomyocytes leads to formation of smaller mitochondria and this is attenuated by inhibition of ROCK<ORGANIZATION>, by siRNA<ORGANIZATION> knockdown of Drp1<GPE> or by expression of a phosphorylation-deficient Drp1 S616A<PERSON> mutant. In addition, activation of RhoA<ORGANIZATION> prevents cell death in cardiomyocytes challenged by oxidative stress and this protection is blocked by siRNA<ORGANIZATION> knockdown of Drp1<GPE> or by Drp1 S616A<PERSON> expression. Taken together our findings demonstrate that RhoA<ORGANIZATION> activation can regulate Drp1<PERSON> to induce mitochondrial fission and subsequent cellular protection, implicating regulation of fission as a novel mechanism contributing to RhoA-mediated cardioprotection.
