 The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between chronic rhino-sinusitis ( CRS<ORGANIZATION> ) and systemic symptoms in patients with IgG4-related disease ( IgG4-RD ). The patients with IgG4-RD, confirmed by restrict association with clinical and histopathological manifestations between March 2013 and July 2016, were enrolled and followed-up for 1 year at the Tongren Hospital<ORGANIZATION>, Capital Medical University<ORGANIZATION>. The patients were divided into two groups: the case group included IgG4-RD patients with CRS<ORGANIZATION> confirmed by clinical and imaging, while the control group included IgG4-RD patients without CRS<ORGANIZATION> confirmed by clinical and imaging. Age, gender, clinical manifestations, the percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood, sedimentation ( ESR<ORGANIZATION> ), C-reaction protein, serum IgE<ORGANIZATION> and IgG4<ORGANIZATION> levels, histopathology, and treatment drugs at the baseline and 1 year of follow-up were compared between the two groups. A total of 46 cases met the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD. A total of 30 patients ( 65.2 % ) had IgG4-RD complicated with CRS<ORGANIZATION>, and were aged 49.7 Â± 13.4 years, with male: female ratio = 2:1. The disease duration in the case group was longer than that in the control group ( 3.0 versus 0.8, p = 0.009 ). The ratio of ocular involvement was higher ( 86.7 versus 60 %, p < 0.001 ), and allergic manifestations including drug allergy, asthma, and allergic skin were more common ( 56.5 versus 20 %, p = 0.004 ), with a higher percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood ( 8.5 versus 3.3 %, p = 0.018 ) and more sensitive to glucocorticoids ( 6.0 versus 3.5, p = 0.004 ) than those in the control group. CRS in patients with IgG4-RD<PERSON> was closely associated with IgG4-related ocular lesions, which was more prone to allergic manifestations accompanied by raised percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood. The treatment of patients with IgG4-RD<PERSON> complicated with CRS<ORGANIZATION> was more effective than those with IgG4-RD without CRS<ORGANIZATION>.
