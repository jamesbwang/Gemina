 Animals that spend more energy than they obtain risk entering allostatic overload, reducing survival and fitness. They are predicted to adjust their daily energy expenditure ( DEE<ORGANIZATION> ) during periods of food scarcity. Adjustments of DEE<ORGANIZATION> to changes in food availability have been well-studied in species in temperate zones during winter, but less so in species enduring seasonal droughts. Likely mechanisms regulating DEE<ORGANIZATION> involve adjustments of activity and maintenance metabolism. Species that experience seasonal droughts and changes in food availability, like the African<ORGANIZATION> striped mouse ( Rhabdomys<ORGANIZATION> pumilio ), are appropriate model organisms to study the regulation of seasonal changes of DEE<ORGANIZATION>. We quantified DEE<ORGANIZATION> using the 'doubly labelled water ' method, measured resting metabolic rate ( RMR<ORGANIZATION> ), and concomitantly determined activity levels using all-day focal observations of 69 free-living striped mice in the cold moist season with high food availability and the hot dry season with low food availability. Striped<PERSON> mice decreased their DEE in the food scarce dry season using multiple mechanisms, especially reductions in RMR<ORGANIZATION>, and reduced overall physical activity. This was further facilitated passively by reduced thermoregulatory costs. Our study demonstrates that animals reduce DEE<ORGANIZATION> via active and passive mechanisms in food-restricted environments, and highlights that several environmental factors should be considered simultaneously when aiming to understand how animals cope with harsh environments.
