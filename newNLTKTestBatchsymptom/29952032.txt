 Left<GPE> atrial appendage occlusion ( LAAO<ORGANIZATION> ) is a technique for preventing thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of irreversible bleeding. In some patients, a spontaneous iatrogenic transseptal leak ( ITL<ORGANIZATION> ) remains after LAAO<ORGANIZATION>. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between ITL<ORGANIZATION> incidence and the results of cardiac function tests in patients who underwent LAAO<ORGANIZATION>. LAOO<ORGANIZATION> was performed in 62 consecutive patients using the Amplatzer Amulet<ORGANIZATION>. Before and 3 months after LAA<ORGANIZATION> occlusion, the 6-min walking distance ( 6MWD ) test was performed in all patients and oxygen consumption assessment ( VO The presence of transseptal leaks after LAAO<ORGANIZATION> does not influence overall cardiac function test results. However, in patients with HF<ORGANIZATION>, there is an increase in oxygen consumption and 6MWD. These results indicate that ITLs<ORGANIZATION> in patients with HF<ORGANIZATION> decrease left atrial pressure, which is the key contributor to the symptoms of heart failure during physical activity.
