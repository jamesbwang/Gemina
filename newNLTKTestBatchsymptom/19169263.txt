 To investigate the effects of sequential nutritional support on nutritional status and immune regulation in patients with early severe traumatic brain injury ( STBI<ORGANIZATION> ). A total of 62 patients diagnosed with STBI<ORGANIZATION> enrolled from Chaoyang Hospital<PERSON> ( Beijing<GPE>, China<GPE> ) from February 2015 to October 2016 were divided into two groups. The observational group ( n=34 ) was given sequential nutritional support and the control group ( n=28 ) was given the standard formula of whole protein enteral preparations. The energy supply for the two groups was 30 kcal/kg/d and protein 1.6 g/kg/d, respectively. The albumin ( ALB<ORGANIZATION> ), total protein ( TP ), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( Hs-CRP ), neuron-specific enolase ( NSE<ORGANIZATION> ), Glasgow Coma Score<PERSON> ( GCS<ORGANIZATION> ), and regulatory T cells before and after nutritional treatment were measured in both groups. At the 14th day, the levels of ALB<ORGANIZATION> ( 41.7±4.2 g/L ) and TP<ORGANIZATION> ( 70.6±4.9 g/L ) were significantly higher than those in the control group ( 33.5±2.3 g/L and 62.3±3.9 g/L ) ( The effect of sequential nutritional support is better than conventional nutritional support in patients with STBI<ORGANIZATION>. The findings call for early identification of malnutrition and individual nutritional support.
