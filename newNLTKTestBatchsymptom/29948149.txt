 We present the case of a 39-year-old female patient with cystoid macular edema of the left eye in the context of sympathetic ophthalmia. The right eye underwent several surgical interventions of both cornea and retina after ocular trauma and was enucleated after first clinical signs compatible with sympathetic ophthalmia and after exclusion of other infectious/non-infectious etiologies. The patient was treated with parabulbar triamcinolone injections and intravitreal injections of a dexamethasone slow-release implant with a good clinical course with respect to the macular edema. A steroid response did not occur over the treatment period of more than 12 months.
