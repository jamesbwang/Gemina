 The relation between driving pressure ( plateau pressure-positive end-expiratory pressure ) and mortality has never been studied in obese ARDS<ORGANIZATION> patients. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 90-day mortality and driving pressure in an ARDS<ORGANIZATION> population ventilated in the intensive care unit ( ICU<ORGANIZATION> ) according to obesity status. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of prospectively collected data of all ARDS patients admitted consecutively to a mixed medical-surgical adult ICU from January 2009 to May 2017. Plateau<PERSON> pressure, compliance of the respiratory system ( Crs ) and driving pressure of the respiratory system within 24 h of ARDS<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis were compared between survivors and non-survivors at day 90 and between obese ( body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m Three hundred sixty-two ARDS<ORGANIZATION> patients were included, 262 ( 72 % ) non-obese and 100 ( 28 % ) obese patients. Mortality rate at day 90 was respectively 47 % ( 95 % CI, 40-53 ) in the non-obese and 46 % ( 95 % CI, 36-56 ) in the obese patients. Driving pressure at day 1 in the non-obese patients was significantly lower in survivors at day 90 ( 11.9 ± 4.2 cmH Contrary to non-obese ARDS<ORGANIZATION> patients, driving pressure was not associated with mortality in obese ARDS<ORGANIZATION> patients.
