 The immune system plays an important role in the breast cancer development. OX40L ( also known as TNFSF4<ORGANIZATION> ), a membrane protein, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor super family binds to its receptor OX40<ORGANIZATION> and this co-stimulation has a crucial role in T<GPE> cell proliferation, survival and cytokine release. Previous studies have shown that OX40L<ORGANIZATION> is associated with cancer. Due<PERSON> to the importance of the T cells in antitumor activities of OX40L we studied the association of rs3850641 ( A→G ) polymorphism of OX40L<ORGANIZATION> gene with the breast cancer. The study included 123 women with breast cancer and 126 healthy volunteers with no signs of cancer. Genomic DNA<PERSON> was extracted from blood leucocytes. Genotype and allele frequencies were determined in patients and control cases with the method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and the statistical analysis was performed by Med Calc<PERSON>. The prevalence of genotype frequencies of AA/AG/GG were 60.9 %, 30.08 % and 8.9 % in patients with breast cancer cases and 74.6 %, 18.25 % and 7.14 % in healthy volunteers while the A and G allelic frequency was 76.01 and 23.98 % in patients and 83.73 and 16.26 % in healthy controls, respectively. Statistical analysis has shown signiﬁcant difference from the comparison of genotype ( p = 0.03 ). It is concluded that the rs3850641 SNP<ORGANIZATION> is significantly associated with the breast cancer susceptibility in Iranian<GPE> population. However, further studies in larger populations including other genetic and environmental factors are required to achieve conclusion.
