 HIV resistance emerging against antiretroviral drugs represents a great threat to the continued prolongation of HIV-infected patients ' lifespans. Methods<PERSON> capable of predicting resistance susceptibility in the development of compounds are therefore in great need. Targeting the major reverse transcription residues Y181<PERSON>, K103<PERSON> and L100<PERSON>, we used the biologi-cal activities of compounds against these enzymes and the wild type reverse transcriptase to create Na√Øve Bayes<PERSON> Net-works. Through this machine learning approach, we could predict with high accuracy whether a compound would be susceptible to loss of potency due to resistance. Also, we could perfectly predict retrospectively whether compounds would be susceptible to both a K103 mutant RT and a Y181 mutant RT. In the study presented here our method outper-formed a traditional molecular mechanics approach. This method should be of broad interest beyond drug discovery efforts, and serves to expand the utility of machine learning for the prediction of physical, chemical or biological prop-erties using the vast information available in the literature.
