 To investigate the effect of ATO<ORGANIZATION> on the proportion of Treg<GPE> in the peripheral blood of patients with severe aplastic anemia ( SAA<ORGANIZATION> ) in vitro. The peripheral blood of 20 newlydiagnosed patients were collected, and the peripheral blood monomuclear cells ( PBMNC<ORGANIZATION> ) were extracted. After the PBMNC<ORGANIZATION> were treated with ATO<ORGANIZATION> of different concentrotions ( 0, 1, 2.5 and 5 µmol/L ) for 96 hours, the proportion of CD44<ORGANIZATION> ATO significantly increased the proportion of Treg<GPE> ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) at the concentration of 2.5 and 5 µmol/L, and the rising degree of Treg<GPE> proportion improved with the increasing ATO<ORGANIZATION> concentration ( r= 0.524 ). Treg<PERSON> proportion increased at a concentration of 1 µmol/L, but without statistical significance ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). At 1 ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), 2.5 ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) and 5 µmol/L ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ), ATO<ORGANIZATION> significantly up-regulated the expression of Foxp3 mRNA<GPE>, and the increase of Foxp3 mRNA<PERSON> positively and linearly correlated with the increase of Treg<GPE> cell-frequency ( r=0.523 ). ATO<ORGANIZATION> significantly reduced the levels of IFN-γ ( at ATO<ORGANIZATION> 1,2.5 and 5 µmol/L, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ), IL-4 ( at ATO<ORGANIZATION> 2.5 µmol/L, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ; at ATO<ORGANIZATION> 5 µmol/L, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) and IL-17 ( at ATO<ORGANIZATION> 2.5 µmol/L, P<PERSON> < 0.05 ; at ATO<ORGANIZATION> 5 µmol/L, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). ATO<ORGANIZATION> had no significant effect on TGF-β1 at 1 ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ) and 2.5 µmol/L ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ), but significantly reduced TGF-β1 level at 5 µmol/L ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). ATO can mediate the immune regulation through up-regulating the proportion of Treg<GPE> in peripheral blood of patients with SAA<ORGANIZATION> and reducing the levels of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17.
