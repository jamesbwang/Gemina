 Low-temperature atmospheric-pressure air plasma is a source of charged and neutral gas species. In this study, N-carrying tobacco plants were inoculated with plasma irradiated and non-irradiated tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV<ORGANIZATION> ) solution, resulting in necrotic local lesions on non-irradiated, but not on irradiated, TMV-inoculated leaves. Virus particles were disrupted by plasma irradiation in an exposure-dependent manner, but the viral coat protein subunit was not. TMV<ORGANIZATION> RNA was also fragmented in a time-dependent manner. These results indicate that plasma irradiation of TMV<ORGANIZATION> can collapse viral particles to the subunit level, degrading TMV<ORGANIZATION> RNA and thereby leading to a loss of infectivity.
