 Lesions in the proximal left coronary artery ( LCA<ORGANIZATION> ) are associated with a poor prognosis compared with other lesional sites. Transthoracic Doppler<PERSON> echocardiography ( TTDE<ORGANIZATION> ) can help to detect proximal LCA<ORGANIZATION> flow, and an accelerated coronary flow velocity ( CFV<ORGANIZATION> ) indicates the presence of proximal LCA<ORGANIZATION> lesions. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of CFV<ORGANIZATION> in the proximal LCA<ORGANIZATION> measured by TTDE<ORGANIZATION>. We enrolled 1472 consecutive hemodynamically stable patients with known or suspected heart disease whose CFV<ORGANIZATION> was successfully detected using TTDE<ORGANIZATION> accompanied by routine echocardiography between 2008 and 2011. The primary outcome was cardiac death ( acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death ) and patients were followed up over a median of 6.3 years. Overall, 42 cardiac deaths ( 3 % ) were observed. An increased CFV<ORGANIZATION> was significantly associated with the outcome in several models based on potential confounders ( age, rate pressure product, Framingham Risk Score<PERSON>, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hemoglobin, brain natriuretic peptide, estimated glomerular filtration rate, left ventricular mass, left ventricular ejection fraction, and E/e ' ). Using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal cut-off value for the CFV<ORGANIZATION> to the association of the outcome was 37 cm/s ( area under the curve, 0.70 ; sensitivity, 82 % ; specificity, 62 % ). In sequential Cox proportional hazards models, the CFV<ORGANIZATION> added incremental prognostic information to the clinical and basic echocardiographic parameters ( chi-squared: 110.7 to 146.6, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). An increased CFV in the proximal LCA<ORGANIZATION> was associated with cardiac death, incremental to the clinical and basic echocardiographic parameters.
