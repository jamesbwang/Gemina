 Vitamin<PERSON> D<ORGANIZATION> regulates the concentrations of calcium and phosphate in blood and promotes the growth and remodeling of bones. The circulating active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, binds to the vitamin D receptor ( VDR<ORGANIZATION> ), which heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor to regulate the expression of target genes. Inactivating mutations in the VDR<ORGANIZATION> gene cause hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets ( HVDRR<ORGANIZATION> ), a rare disorder characterized by an early onset of rickets, growth retardation, skeletal deformities, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and in some cases alopecia. We describe eight new HVDRR patients from four unrelated consanguineous families. The VDR<ORGANIZATION> gene was sequenced to identify mutations. The management of patients over a period of up to 11 years following the initial diagnosis is assessed. Although all patients exhibit main features of HVDRR<ORGANIZATION> and carry the same c.885C > A ( p.Y295* ) loss of function mutation in the VDR<ORGANIZATION> gene, there was heterogeneity of the manifestations of HVDRR-associated phenotypes and developmental milestones. These eight patients were successfully treated over a period of 11 years. All clinical symptoms were improved except alopecia. The study concludes that VDR<ORGANIZATION> sequencing and laboratory tests are essential to confirm HVDRR<ORGANIZATION> and to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.
