 Previous studies have shown a relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and birth weight. We performed this meta-analysis to resolve the problem of inconsistent results. We conducted a literature search of PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Embase<PERSON> and the Cochrane<ORGANIZATION> Library using `` Diabetes Mellitus<PERSON>, Type 2, '' `` Birth Weight<PERSON>, '' and some related free words. Twenty-one studies were included in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, involving a total of 313,165 participants and 22,341 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases. A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale<PERSON> was used to evaluate the methodological quality of studies included. We used Review Manager<PERSON> 5.3 for data merging and statistical analysis. Results were expressed as odds ratio ( OR ) and 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ). The risk of diabetes with low birth weight ( < 2,500 g ) was higher than that with birth weight â‰¥2,500 g, ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.51, 95 % CI: 1.43, 1.58 ). Compared with normal birth weight ( 2,500-4,000 g ), low birth weight, but not high birth weight, increased the risk of diabetes ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.41, 95 % CI: 1.26, 1.58 ). There is a negative association between birth weight and the future risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
