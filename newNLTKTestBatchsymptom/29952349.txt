 Acute<GPE> pulmonary embolism ( PE ) is a major threat to the health and lives of hospitalized patients. This study was conducted to clarify the real-world outcomes of pulmonary embolectomy.Methods and Results: Retrospective investigation of 355 patients who underwent pulmonary embolectomy for acute PE was conducted using the Japanese<GPE> Cardiovascular Surgery Database<PERSON>. Risk factors for operative death within 30 days after pulmonary embolectomy and major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE<ORGANIZATION> ), including operative death, postoperative stroke and postoperative coma, were analyzed. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR<ORGANIZATION> ) was required preoperatively in 27.6 %, and preoperative veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed in 26.5 %. Urgent or emergency operation was performed in 93 % of patients. Operative mortality rate was 73/355 ( 20.6 % ). Incidence of MACE<ORGANIZATION> was 97/355 ( 27.3 % ). In univariate analysis, preoperative predictors of death were obesity, renal dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver injury, recent myocardial infarction, shock, refractory shock, CPR<ORGANIZATION>, heart failure, inotrope use, poor left ventricular function, preoperative arrhythmia and tricuspid regurgitation. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for operative death were heart failure ( P=0.013 ), poor left ventricular function ( P=0.007 ), and respiratory failure ( P=0.001 ). Poor<PERSON> left ventricular function ( P=0.033 ), preoperative CPR<ORGANIZATION> ( P=0.002 ) and respiratory failure ( P=0.007 ) were independent risk factors for MACE<ORGANIZATION>. The outcomes of pulmonary embolectomy were acceptable, considering the urgency and preoperative comorbidities of patients. Early triage of patients with hemodynamically unstable PE is important.
