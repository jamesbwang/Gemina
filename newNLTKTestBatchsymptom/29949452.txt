 Rab<PERSON> GTPases<ORGANIZATION> recruit peripheral membrane proteins and can define organelle identity. Rab18<PERSON> localizes to the ER but also to lipid droplets ( LDs<ORGANIZATION> ), where it has been implicated in effector protein recruitment and in defining LD identity. Here, we studied Rab18<PERSON> localization and function in a human mammary carcinoma cell line. Rab18<PERSON> localized to the ER<ORGANIZATION> and to LD membranes upon LD<ORGANIZATION> induction, with the latter depending on the Rab18<GPE> activation state. In cells lacking Rab18<PERSON>, LDs<ORGANIZATION> were modestly reduced in size and numbers, but we found little evidence for Rab18<PERSON> function in LD<GPE> formation, LD<ORGANIZATION> turnover upon cell starvation, or the targeting of several proteins to LDs<ORGANIZATION>. We conclude that Rab18<PERSON> is not a general, necessary component of the protein machinery involved in LD<GPE> biogenesis or turnover.
