 Associations between the overall quality of Japanese<GPE> diets and metabolic risk factors are largely unknown. This cross-sectional study investigated this issue using data from the 2012 National Health<ORGANIZATION> and Nutrition Survey<ORGANIZATION>, Japan<GPE>. Dietary intake was assessed by a 1-day weighed dietary record in 15,618 Japanese<GPE> adults aged â‰¥ 20 years. Overall diet quality was assessed by adherence to the Japanese<GPE> Food Guide<ORGANIZATION> Spinning Top ( JFG<ORGANIZATION> score ), its modified version ( modified JFG<ORGANIZATION> score ), the Mediterranean<GPE> diet score ( MDS<ORGANIZATION> ) and the Dietary Approaches<ORGANIZATION> to Stop Hypertension<GPE> ( DASH<ORGANIZATION> ) score. Metabolic<ORGANIZATION> risk factors included BMI<ORGANIZATION>, waist circumference, blood pressure, total, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol and glycated haemoglobin. While DASH<ORGANIZATION> score was consistently associated with favourable nutrient intake patterns ( including higher micronutrient and dietary fibre intakes and lower SFA<ORGANIZATION> and sodium intakes ), other scores were associated with both favourable and unfavourable aspects ( e.g., lower micronutrient intakes for JFG<ORGANIZATION> score, higher SFA<ORGANIZATION> intakes for modified JFG<ORGANIZATION> score and higher sodium intakes for MDS<ORGANIZATION> ). The associations with metabolic risk factors were also inconsistent and unexpected, including positive associations of JFG<ORGANIZATION> and modified JFG<ORGANIZATION> scores with LDL-cholesterol, inverse associations of MDS<ORGANIZATION> with HDL-cholesterol and null associations of DASH<ORGANIZATION> score with blood pressure. This study did not show expected and consistent associations of the four available diet quality scores with nutrient intakes and metabolic risk factors in Japanese<GPE> adults. This in turn suggests the need for a scientific base on which to develop an appropriate tool for assessing the quality of diets in the Japanese<GPE> context.
