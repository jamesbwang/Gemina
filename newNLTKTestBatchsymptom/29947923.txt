 Gestational<GPE> diabetes mellitus ( GDM<ORGANIZATION> ) is a common complication of pregnancy that has substantial short- and long-term adverse health implications for women and their children. However, large-scale studies on genetic risk loci for GDM<ORGANIZATION> remain sparse. We conducted a case-control study among 2636 women with GDM<ORGANIZATION> and 6086 non-GDM control women from the Nurses<ORGANIZATION> ' Health Study II<PERSON> and the Danish National Birth Cohort<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 112 susceptibility genetic variants confirmed by genome-wide association studies for type 2 diabetes were selected and measured. A weighted genetic risk score ( GRS<ORGANIZATION> ) was created based on variants that were significantly associated with risk of GDM<ORGANIZATION> after correcting for the false discovery rate. For the first time, we identified eight variants associated with GDM<ORGANIZATION>, namely rs7957197 ( HNF1A<ORGANIZATION> ), rs10814916 ( GLIS3<ORGANIZATION> ), rs3802177 ( SLC30A8<ORGANIZATION> ), rs9379084 ( RREB1<ORGANIZATION> ), rs34872471 ( TCF7L2<ORGANIZATION> ), rs7903146 ( TCF7L2<ORGANIZATION> ), rs11787792 ( GPSM1<ORGANIZATION> ) and rs7041847 ( GLIS3<ORGANIZATION> ). In addition, we confirmed three variants, rs10830963 ( MTNR1B<ORGANIZATION> ), rs1387153 ( MTNR1B<ORGANIZATION> ) and rs4506565 ( TCF7L2<ORGANIZATION> ), that had previously been significantly associated with GDM<ORGANIZATION> risk. Furthermore, compared with participants in the first ( lowest ) quartile of weighted GRS<ORGANIZATION> based on these 11 SNPs<ORGANIZATION>, the ORs<ORGANIZATION> for GDM<ORGANIZATION> were 1.07 ( 95 % CI 0.93, 1.22 ), 1.23 ( 95 % CI 1.07, 1.41 ) and 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.34, 1.74 ) for participants in the second, third and fourth ( highest ) quartiles, respectively. The significant positive associations between the weighted GRS<ORGANIZATION> and risk of GDM<ORGANIZATION> persisted across most of the strata of major risk factors for GDM<ORGANIZATION>, including family history of type 2 diabetes, smoking status, BMI<ORGANIZATION> and age. In this large-scale case-control study with women from two independent populations, eight novel GDM<ORGANIZATION> SNPs were identified. These findings offer the potential to improve our understanding of the aetiology of GDM<ORGANIZATION>, and particularly of biological mechanisms related to beta cell function.
