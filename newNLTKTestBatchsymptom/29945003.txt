 The volume of activated tissue ( VTA<ORGANIZATION> ) is a model that try to represent in 3D the diffusion of the current provided by the DBS<ORGANIZATION> lead on brain structures. The objective of the present study was to assess the correlations between the VTA<ORGANIZATION>, activation of the corticospinal tract, and the intra-operative side effect ( ISE<ORGANIZATION> ) threshold. This double-blind, single-center study was performed between September, 2016, and July, 2017. We identified two groups for statistical analysis: the entire study population, and a subset of patients with additional diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI<ORGANIZATION> ) data for determining the location of the pyramidal tract. We determined the intensity threshold at which the VTA<ORGANIZATION> reached the border of the target nucleus ( referred to as VTAn<ORGANIZATION> ) and the intensity threshold when the VTA<ORGANIZATION> reached the pyramidal tract ( referred to as VTAndti<ORGANIZATION> ). In each group of patients, we studied the correlation between the ISE<ORGANIZATION> threshold and the VTAn<ORGANIZATION> or VTAndti<ORGANIZATION> threshold. Fifteen patients were included in the study. In both groups, there was a significant correlation between the VTA<ORGANIZATION> intensity threshold and the ISE<ORGANIZATION> threshold ( p=0.018 ; r=0.31 for VTAn<ORGANIZATION> in the entire study population ). In the subset of patients with valid tractography data, the correlation was stronger ( p=0.002 ; r=0.5 for VTAndti<ORGANIZATION> ). The present study is the first to show a relationship between the intensity threshold as determined by the use of the VTA<ORGANIZATION> and the intra-operative side effect threshold. The correlation between the clinical features and the VTA<ORGANIZATION> appear stronger when the model was based on a combination of high-resolution anatomic data and interpretable DTI<ORGANIZATION> data.
