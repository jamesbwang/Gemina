 Complex I deficiency is one of the most common mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. This deficiency of oxidative phosphorylation results from mutation in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA<ORGANIZATION>. Mutations in NDUFV1<GPE> ( Flavin<ORGANIZATION> binding subunit of Respiratory<GPE> complex 1 ) results in neurological manifestations including Leigh<PERSON> syndrome and leucoencephalopathy. The authors report a one-year-old boy with history of regression of motor milestones following a trivial fall from the bed. His magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse, cystic leucoencephalopathy involving corpus callosum and periventricular white matter. Clinical<PERSON> features and radiological findings may resemble those of vanishing white matter disease. Next generation sequencing revealed likely compound heterozygous missense pathogenic variant in exon 8 of NDUFV1<ORGANIZATION> gene [ c.1156C > C/T ( p.Arg386Cys ) ] and possibly novel splice site variation in intron 2 of NDUFV1<ORGANIZATION> gene ( c.155 + 1G > G/A ). NDUFV1<ORGANIZATION> related leucoencephalopathy must be considered among those presenting with sudden onset of motor regression with neuroimaging correlate of diffuse cystic leucodystrophy.
