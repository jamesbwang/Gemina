 We performed a retrospective analysis to compare the efficacy of whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT<ORGANIZATION> ) combined with temozolomide ( TMZ<ORGANIZATION> ) versus WBRT<ORGANIZATION> alone as first-line treatment for brain metastases ( BM ). Seventy-eight non-small cell lung cancer patients with BM<ORGANIZATION> were observed, including 45 patients who received WBRT<ORGANIZATION> plus TMZ<ORGANIZATION> ( TMZ<ORGANIZATION> + WBRT ) and 33 patients who received WBRT<ORGANIZATION> alone ( WBRT<ORGANIZATION> ). The primary outcome was overall survival ( OS ). Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ), objective response rate ( ORR<ORGANIZATION> ), and adverse events. The TMZ<ORGANIZATION> + WBRT arm achieved significant improvement in ORR<GPE> ( P<PERSON> = 0.0108 ) compared to the WBRT<ORGANIZATION> arm. PFS in the TMZ<ORGANIZATION> + WBRT arm was significantly longer than in the RT<ORGANIZATION> arm ( 6.0 vs. 3.5 months ; P<PERSON> = 0.038 ). OS was not significantly different between the two arms. Although increased adverse reactions were experienced in the TMZ<ORGANIZATION> + WBRT arm, patients were tolerant of the side effects. Statistically significant differences in neurocognitive function and quality of life were observed between the arms at six months. Concomitant<ORGANIZATION> TMZ + WBRT compared to WBRT<ORGANIZATION> alone significantly increases ORR<ORGANIZATION> and median PFS in patients with BM<ORGANIZATION>, but no remarkable difference in median OS was found. Adding TMZ<ORGANIZATION> to the treatment strategy could prevent neurocognitive function and quality of life from deteriorating. Although the addition of TMZ<ORGANIZATION> increases the incidence of adverse effects, no significant difference was observed. Thus, TMZ<ORGANIZATION> is safe and effective.
