 Treatment<GPE> duration, treatment interval, formulation and type of antimicrobial ( antibiotic ) are modifiable factors that will influence antimicrobial selection pressure. Currently, the impact of the route of administration on the occurrence of resistance in humans is unclear. In this retrospective multi-center cohort study, we assessed the impact of different variables on antimicrobial resistance ( AMR<ORGANIZATION> ) in pathogens isolated from the urinary tract in older adults. A generalized estimating equations ( GEE<ORGANIZATION> ) model was constructed using 7397 Resistance in Our model describing shows a dose-response relation between antibiotic use and AMR<ORGANIZATION> in Retrospectively registered.
