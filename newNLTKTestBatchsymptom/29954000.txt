 High-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC<ORGANIZATION> ) oxygen therapy may provide effective respiratory management of hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients with interstitial lung disease ( ILD<ORGANIZATION> ) with a do-not-intubate ( DNI<ORGANIZATION> ) order. The aim was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of HFNC<ORGANIZATION> for these patients. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients requesting a DNI<ORGANIZATION> order for hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with ILD<ORGANIZATION>, comparing treatment with HFNC<ORGANIZATION> and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV<ORGANIZATION> ). Outcomes measured were 30-day survival, in-hospital mortality, temporary interruption and discontinuation of the treatment at the patient 's request, adverse events, oral intake, and communication ability at the end of life. A total of 84 patients ( HFNC<ORGANIZATION>, n = 54 ; NPPV<ORGANIZATION>, n = 30 ) were analyzed. Neither 30-day survival ( HFNC<ORGANIZATION> 31.5 % vs. NPPV 30.0 % ; p = 0.86 ) nor in-hospital mortality ( HFNC<ORGANIZATION> 79.6 % vs. NPPV 83.3 % ; p = 0.78 ) differed significantly. The temporary interruption and discontinuation rates were significantly lower in the HFNC<ORGANIZATION> group than in the NPPV<ORGANIZATION> group ( 3.7 vs. 23.3 % ; p = 0.009 and 0 vs. 10 % ; p = 0.043, respectively ), and that group had significantly fewer adverse events. Among patients who died in the hospital, those treated with HFNC<ORGANIZATION> had significantly better oral intake and ability to converse until just before death. HFNC<ORGANIZATION> had a survival rate equivalent to that of NPPV<ORGANIZATION> and was better tolerated by patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with ILD who had a DNI<ORGANIZATION> order. HFNC<ORGANIZATION> allowed patients to eat and converse until just before death, suggesting that HFNC<ORGANIZATION> in these patients is a reasonable palliative treatment.
