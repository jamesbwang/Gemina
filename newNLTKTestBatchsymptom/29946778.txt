 Aggressive lymphomas exhibit the Warburg<ORGANIZATION> effect. Lactic<PERSON> acidosis is a result of overproduction of lactate and leads to a fatal prognosis. Mutation of p53 helps cancer cells survive glutamine deprivation. PI3K<ORGANIZATION> regulates fatty acid synthesis ( FAS<ORGANIZATION> ) in primary effusion lymphoma ( PEL<ORGANIZATION> ) and other B-NHLs. AMPK<ORGANIZATION> regulates NADPH<ORGANIZATION> balance for fatty acid oxidation as a means of supplementing the TCA<ORGANIZATION> cycle. PRPS2<ORGANIZATION> couples protein and nucleotide biosynthesis to drive lymphomagenesis. mTOR activation promotes fatty acid synthesis ( FAS<ORGANIZATION> ). MYC<ORGANIZATION> regulates cancer cell metabolism under glucose-deprived and hypoxic conditions. HIF-1 acts as a regulator in hypoxia adaption and the related metabolic change.
