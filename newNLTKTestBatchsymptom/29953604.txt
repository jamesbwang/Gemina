 Many surgical procedures are performed in outpatient settings, and outpatient joint replacements are one of the emerging trends in orthopedics. Rising consumer demand for value-driven health care, new technology, and pain management advancements, and more physicians training in minimally invasive surgical techniques during their residency have driven this change. When a facility is considering the establishment of an outpatient joint arthroplasty program, leaders must take into consideration the outcomes data from the facility 's current joint arthroplasty program. Additional factors in establishing a successful outpatient program include careful patient selection, preoperative patient education, the presence of a case manager, and specialized protocols and techniques.
