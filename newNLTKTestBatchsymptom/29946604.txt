 Four dimeric lanthanide alkoxide complexes bearing ONNO<ORGANIZATION> bipyrrolidine salan ligands ( LMeH2/LtBuH2 ) have been prepared with Nd<PERSON>, Sm<PERSON> and Yb. Depending on the metal and substituents, these complexes adopt varying coordination geometries. While investigating the hydrolytic degradation of these complexes, three dimeric mixed alkoxide/hydroxide and bis-hydroxide products were also prepared, isolated and characterised. Despite paramagnetism, 1H NMR<ORGANIZATION> and diffusion ordered spectroscopy ( DOSY<ORGANIZATION> ) allowed additional characterisation alongside elemental and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. These systems were very active for the controlled ring-opening polymerisation ( ROP<ORGANIZATION> ) of rac-lactide ( LA<ORGANIZATION> ), under industrially relevant melt conditions and in solution, yielding complete conversion within 5 minutes at [ Ln ]: [ LA<ORGANIZATION> ] ratios of up to 3000: 1 in toluene, and at 80 °C, whilst retaining low dispersities ( Đ = 1.1 ). 1H DOSY<ORGANIZATION> NMR spectroscopy was employed to monitor polymer growth from the metal centres in situ, and revealed a dinuclear catalytically active species.
