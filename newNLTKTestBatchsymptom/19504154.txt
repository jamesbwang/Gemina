 Computed Tomography<GPE> ( CT ) with myelogram is a relatively safe procedure. It requires the use of nonionic contrast agents which, unlike ionic contrast agents, have been associated with low complication rates. We report a case of a 69-year-old female who developed diffuse bilateral cerebral edema following a lumber myelogram with the use of intrathecal nonionic contrast agent Omnipaque<GPE> ( Iohexol<ORGANIZATION> ) 300. We were able to find one other reported case of cerebral edema following the use of intrathecal nonionic contrast agent in the literature.
