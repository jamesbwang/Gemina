 Glatiramer<GPE> acetate ( GA ) 20 mg/day ( GA20<ORGANIZATION> ) is associated with immediate post-injection reactions ( PIRs<ORGANIZATION> ). For convenience of use, approved GA 40 mg three times weekly ( GA40<ORGANIZATION> ) delivers a similar weekly dose. The dose and concentration of a single GA40<ORGANIZATION> injection are, however, twice as high as for GA20<ORGANIZATION>, and post-injection adverse events may differ. Cases of atypical PIRs<ORGANIZATION> to GA40<ORGANIZATION> prompted us to systematically monitor such events. The aim was to characterize atypical PIRs<ORGANIZATION> in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patients treated with GA40<ORGANIZATION>. Clinical<PERSON> practice data were prospectively collected in consecutive relapsing-remitting MS patients. Descriptive statistics for categorical and continuous variables, Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared tests for baseline comparisons, and Cox<PERSON> regression models for association of variables to first atypical PIRs<ORGANIZATION> were applied. Forty-six out of 173 patients ( 26.6 % ) given GA40<ORGANIZATION> experienced any PIRs. Of those, 38 ( 22.0 % ) had atypical, 14 ( 8.1 % ) had combined typical and atypical, and 26 ( 15.0 % ) had recurrent atypical PIRs<ORGANIZATION>, most frequently shivering ( 13.3 % ) and nausea/vomiting ( 8.1 % ). Compared to typical PIRs<ORGANIZATION>, onset of atypical PIRs<ORGANIZATION> was significantly delayed ( median 30 vs 1 min, p < 0.0001 ), and their median duration longer ( median 120 vs 6 min, p = 0.00013 ). Previous exposure to GA20<ORGANIZATION> was associated with a lower risk of atypical PIRs<ORGANIZATION> [ hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.35, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.17-0.72, p = 0.0039 ]. Patients experiencing PIRs<ORGANIZATION> with GA20<ORGANIZATION> were at elevated risk for atypical PIRs<ORGANIZATION> with GA40<ORGANIZATION> ( HR<ORGANIZATION> = 5.75, 95 % CI 1.66-19.94, p = 0.0059 ). Atypical PIRs<PERSON> with GA40<ORGANIZATION>, especially gastrointestinal symptoms and/or fever/shivering, had a delayed onset and occurred in a significant proportion of our patients. Their real prevalence should be assessed in appropriately designed studies accounting for nocebo responses. Initial dose titration might reduce PIR<ORGANIZATION> frequency.
