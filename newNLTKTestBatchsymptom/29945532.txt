 Letermovir<GPE> is an antiviral agent recently approved by the Food<ORGANIZATION> and Drug Administration<PERSON> for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus infection in adult patients that are cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Liver<PERSON> toxicity was not observed in the clinical trials that led to its approval. This report highlights a case of letermovir associated transaminitis with successful rechallenge through peak and recovery of the hepatic serum enzymes. Because there is currently no published evidence to support the adverse event, the temporal relationship and response to rechallenge that was observed is essential to establishing the probable causality in this case.
