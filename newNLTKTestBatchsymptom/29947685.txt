 Actually the lifestyle exposes the population to several risk factors related to alimentary habits and less physical activity that contributes to chronic diseases appearance worldwide. To analyze the association between salivary cortisol and the components of metabolic syndrome. This is a cross-sectional study. As part of it, 28 individuals aged 30-59 years presenting three or more of the following findings: CA: ≥88 cm for women and ≥102 cm for men ; SBP<ORGANIZATION> > 130 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> and DBP<ORGANIZATION> > 85 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> ; GL > 100 mg/dl ; TG > 150 mg/dl ; HDL<ORGANIZATION> < 40 mg/dl for men and < 50 mg/dl for women. Was performed analysis of salivary cortisol ( by radioimmunoassay ) from 25 salivary samples collected throughout the day, for evaluating changes in the circadian rhythm of this hormone ( 8AM, noon and 8PM ). 28 evaluated individuals had a mean age of 51.9±7.5 years, mostly women ( 64.3 % ) and a mean of BMI<ORGANIZATION> 33.6±3.2 kg/m². The cortisol level from the 8AM averaged 18.7±4.8 ng/dlL. Individuals with FPG<ORGANIZATION> > 110mg/dl, have significantly lower average levels of cortisol than ones with FPG<ORGANIZATION> < 110 ( 12.8±5,2 vs. 17.3±4.2 ). Significant correlations were HOMA<ORGANIZATION> vs. WC ( r=0,465 ; p˂0,005 ) and TG<ORGANIZATION> ( r=0,473 ; p˂0,005 ), WC<ORGANIZATION> vs. FG ( r=0,446 ; p˂0,005 ) and BMI<ORGANIZATION> ( r=0,730 ; p˂0.0001 ) ; TG vs. HDL<ORGANIZATION> ( r=0,441 p˂0,005 ) and FG<ORGANIZATION> ( r=0,440 ; p˂0,005 ). Morning salivary cortisol in subjects with chronically elevated blood glucose can represent a downregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis. This is an important finding not yet well investigated.
