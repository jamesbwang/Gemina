 A short inter-pregnancy interval increases the risk for maternal and neonatal deaths in addition to other pregnancy complications including: preterm delivery, low birth weight, anaemia and premature rupture of membranes. However, only one half of Kenyan<GPE> women, who have no desire to conceive immediately after birth, are using contraception one year after delivery. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of uptake of post-partum family planning ( PPFP<ORGANIZATION> ). Setting: The study was conducted among post-partum women accompanying their children for their first measles vaccination at Webuye County Hospital<ORGANIZATION> ( WCH<ORGANIZATION> ), in western Kenya<PERSON>. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving 259 randomly sampled post-partum women, accompanying their children for their first measles vaccination. A structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of PPFP<ORGANIZATION> uptake. Results: The uptake of PPFP<ORGANIZATION> among women at 9 months post-partum at WCH<ORGANIZATION> was found to be 78.4 % Â± 5.0 %. The odds of PPFP<ORGANIZATION> uptake among women living with their sexual partners was 88.2 % less than among those not living with their partners with the true population effect between 97 % and 51 % ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.118 ; 95 % CI: 0.028-0.494 ; p = 0.003 ). Conclusions: Not living with her sexual partner in the same house is the key predictor of a woman 's PPFP<ORGANIZATION> uptake in WCH<ORGANIZATION>. This study recommends that any programme aimed at improving post-partum contraceptive use in WCH<ORGANIZATION> should target women who live with their partners in the same house.
