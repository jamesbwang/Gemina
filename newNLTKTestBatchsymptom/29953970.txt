 Pancreatic<GPE> ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the most lethal malignant tumors with poor prognosis. Conventional chemotherapies including gemcitabine have failed owing to weak response and side effects. Hence<PERSON> novel treatment regimens are urgently needed to improve the therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we aimed to assess the anticancer activity of melatonin and sorafenib as a novel therapy against PDAC<ORGANIZATION>. We used various apoptosis assay and PDAC<ORGANIZATION> xenograft model to assess anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo. We applied phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK<ORGANIZATION> ) array and phospho-tyrosine kinase array to explore the mechanism of the combined therapy. Western blotting, proximity ligation assay, and immunoprecipitation assay were also performed for validation. Melatonin<PERSON> synergized with sorafenib to suppress the growth of PDAC<ORGANIZATION> both in vitro and in vivo. The effect was due to increased apoptosis rate of PDAC<ORGANIZATION> cells that was accompanied by mitochondria dysfunction. The enhanced anticancer efficacy by the co-treatment could be explained by blockade of PDGFR-β/STAT3 signaling pathway and melatonin receptor ( MT ) -mediated STAT3<ORGANIZATION>. Melatonin<PERSON> reinforces the anticancer activity of sorafenib by downregulation of PDGFR-β/STAT3 signaling pathway and melatonin receptor ( MT ) -mediated STAT3<ORGANIZATION>. The combination of the two agents might be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating PDAC<ORGANIZATION>.
