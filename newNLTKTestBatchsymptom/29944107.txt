 It remains a major challenge to improve the oral antitumor efficacy of hydroxycamptothecin ( HCPT<ORGANIZATION> ). The aim of this study was to develop the oral HCPT<ORGANIZATION> formulation via nanocochleates technology. After HCPT<ORGANIZATION> was incorporated into calcium ions-induced nanocochleates, its oral bioavailability significantly enhanced, up to a 2.3-fold. Most importantly, in vivo antitumor effect of HCPT-loaded nanocochleates could be achieved upon oral administration to hepatoma-bearing BALB/c-nude mice, showing the remarkable inhibition of tumor growth as compared to normal saline, HCPT<ORGANIZATION> suspensions and HCPT-loaded liposomes. Caco-2 cells, as an in vitro model, were conducted to investigate the absorption mechanisms of intestinal tract. Caco-2 transport studies indicated that HCPT-loaded nanocochleates were uptake via clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, ZO-1, F-actin and claudin-4, known as three cellular tight junction proteins, were obvious down-regulation, which suggested that HCPT-loaded nanocochleates could open cellular tight junctions and paracellular route. In conclusion, nanocochleates served as a promising vehicle to facilitate the oral delivery of HCPT<ORGANIZATION>.
