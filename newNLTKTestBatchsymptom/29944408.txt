 The connectedness in Arctic<GPE> regions between migratory waterbird populations originating from different continents and the potential for virus exchange at their shared Arctic<PERSON> breeding ground point to the need to explore the largely unstudied circumpolar circulation of avian influenza viruses ( AIV<ORGANIZATION> ). We here report the investigation of AIV<ORGANIZATION> in wild birds and lakes in a high Arctic<GPE> area of Northeast Greenland<GPE>. No AIV<PERSON> could be detected in the fecal, feather, and water samples collected from large flocks of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus and barnacle geese Branta<ORGANIZATION> leucopsis in and around refuge lakes, where they congregate at high density during their flightless molting period in summer.
