 To assess activation of immune system in rheumatic heart disease ( RHD<ORGANIZATION> ) patients in the form of AECA<ORGANIZATION>, ACL<ORGANIZATION> and anti GBM<ORGANIZATION> antibodies. Descriptive, observational study. Department of Immunology<GPE>, University<ORGANIZATION> of Health Sciences<ORGANIZATION> ( UHS<ORGANIZATION> ), Lahore<GPE>, and Outpatient Department<ORGANIZATION>, Punjab Institute<PERSON> of Cardiology<GPE>, from February 2015 to January 2016. Clinically suspected patients of RHD<ORGANIZATION> and confirmed by echocardiography were included. AECA<ORGANIZATION>, ACL<ORGANIZATION> and anti GBM<ORGANIZATION> antibodies were investigated in the sera of RHD<ORGANIZATION> patients. Eighty-six RHD<ORGANIZATION> patients were included in the study ; the mean age of the patients was 30 Â±9.3 years. Among these patients, 59 ( 68.6 % ) were females and 27 ( 31.4 % ) were males. AECA<ORGANIZATION> was most commonly detected autoantibody i.e. in 17 ( 19.8 % ) patients ; whereas, ACL<ORGANIZATION> was detected in only 2 ( 2.3 % ) subjects. Another 2 ( 2.3 % ) patients had both AECA<ORGANIZATION> and ACL<ORGANIZATION> antibodies. AGBM<ORGANIZATION> was not detected in any of the patients. ACL<ORGANIZATION> was seen in females with isolated MR. AECA<PERSON> were seen in mixed valvular heart disease patients. Immune system gets activated in RHD<ORGANIZATION> patients leading to formation of different antibodies, and they are also related to the type of lesion. ACL<ORGANIZATION> antibodies are present in females with isolated mitral regurgitation, while AECA<ORGANIZATION> are present in both the genders with mixed valvular heart disease. Anti GBM<PERSON> antibodies are not seen in RHD<ORGANIZATION> patients.
