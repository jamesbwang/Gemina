 Severe<GPE> hemorrhage remains the leading cause of death among trauma patients. Resuscitative balloon occlusion of the aorta ( REBOA<ORGANIZATION> ) is an endovascular alternative to the established emergency room thoracotomy with cross-clamping of the aorta in patients with severe abdominal or pelvic bleeding. The article reports on initial experiences with REBOA<ORGANIZATION>. Based on the literature and own experiences the pathophysiology, indications, contraindications, technical details and first results with REBOA<ORGANIZATION> are presented. The REBOA<ORGANIZATION> procedure is indicated in patients with treatment-refractive hemorrhagic shock with severe abdominal or pelvic bleeding. Via a transfemoral approach a balloon catheter is placed in the aorta and inflated. Depending on the indication the aortic occlusion is located in a supradiaphragmatic ( zone 1 ) or infrarenal ( zone 3 ) position. Experimental results proved a significant increase in central perfusion pressure after performance of REBOA<ORGANIZATION>. Furthermore, first clinical data indicate an improved patient survival rate after trauma. Improvements of the devices and minimizing the access trauma using small 7 Fr sheaths decreased the perioperative complication rate. The REBOA<ORGANIZATION> procedure is a promising endovascular technique for temporary stabilization of the circulation in patients with hemorrhagic shock. Further<PERSON> clinical studies and registries have yet to prove its superiority over emergency room thoracotomy.
