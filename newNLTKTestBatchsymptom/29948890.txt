 This study aimed to validate the accuracy of major-event risk models created in the multicenter J-ACCESS prognostic study in a new cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). Three multivariable J-ACCESS risk models were created to predict major cardiac events ( cardiac death, non-fatal acute coronary syndrome, and severe heart failure requiring hospitalization ): Model 1, four variables of age, summed stress score, left ventricular ejection fraction and diabetes ; Model 2 with five variables including estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR, continuous ) ; and Model 3 with categorical eGFR<ORGANIZATION>. The validation data used three-year ( 3y ) cohort of patients with CKD<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 526, major events 11.2 % ). Survival analysis of low ( < 3 % /3y ), intermediate ( 3 % to 9 % /3y ), and high ( > 9 % /3y ) -risk groups showed good stratification by all three models ( actual event rates: 3.1 %, 9.9 %, and 15.9 % in the three groups with eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m The J-ACCESS risk models can stratify patients with CKD<ORGANIZATION> and eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m
