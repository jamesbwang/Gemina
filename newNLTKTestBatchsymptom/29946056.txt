 Photoreceptors have high intrinsic metabolic demand and are exquisitely sensitive to metabolic perturbation. In addition, they shed a large portion of their outer segment lipid membranes in a circadian manner, increasing the metabolic burden on the outer retina associated with the re-synthesis of cell membranes and disposal of the cellular cargo. Here we demonstrate that deletion of both ABCA1<ORGANIZATION> and ABCG1<ORGANIZATION> in rod photoreceptors leads to age-related accumulation of cholesterol metabolites in the outer retina, photoreceptor dysfunction, degeneration of rod outer segments, and ultimately blindness. A high fat diet ( HFD<ORGANIZATION> ) significantly accelerates rod neurodegeneration and vision loss, further highlighting the role of lipid homeostasis in regulating photoreceptor neurodegeneration and vision.
