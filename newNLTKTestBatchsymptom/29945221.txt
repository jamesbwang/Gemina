 Yeast<GPE> nucleotides are a fine functional additive in human and animals. The effects of dietary yeast nucleotides supplementation on intestinal development, expression of intestinal barrier-related genes, intestinal microbiota, and infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV<ORGANIZATION> ) antibody titer of specific pathogen-free ( SPF<ORGANIZATION> ) chickens were investigated. A total of 60 1-d-old chickens were divided into 4 groups, each of which included 3 replicates of 5 chickens. Group 1 served as a control that was fed a basal diet. Groups 2 to 4 were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.1 %, 0.3 % and 0.5 % yeast nucleotides, respectively. All chickens were inoculated intranasally with inactivated IBV<ORGANIZATION> vaccine at day 1 and day 10. At day 17, the intestinal development, expression of intestinal barrier-related genes and microbiota were evaluated. There was a significant increased ileal villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in group 2 ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Moreover, group 4 exhibited higher expression of zonula occludens-1 ( ZO-1 ) and Occludin<GPE> gene in ileum ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), whereas groups 2 and 3 exhibited higher expression of Mucin 2 ( MUC2<ORGANIZATION> ) and trefoil factor 2 ( TFF2<ORGANIZATION> ) gene ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), group 2 showed lower expression of IFN-Î± gene ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Dietary yeast nucleotides increased intestinal bacterial diversity ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), and the abundance of Lactobacillus<GPE> ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). At day 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 45, the serum IBV<ORGANIZATION> antibody titers were tested. Group 2 exhibited higher IBV<ORGANIZATION> antibody titer at day 17 ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), furthermore, groups 2 to 4 reached the effective levels 1 wk earlier than control group. In conclusion, dietary yeast nucleotides supplementation can help birds to mount a faster and stronger antibody response to IBV<ORGANIZATION> vaccine. In addition, dietary yeast nucleotides supplementation can also promote the intestinal development and barrier-related genes expression, and diversity and richness of intestinal microbiota.
