 The aim of this article was to investigate the use of laser Doppler<PERSON> flowmetry ( LDF<ORGANIZATION> ) combined with a fast Fourier transformation ( FFT<ORGANIZATION> ). LDF<ORGANIZATION> data in relation to three different scenarios were evaluated: ( a ) LDF<ORGANIZATION> records of a right central upper incisor of one patient were used for FFT<ORGANIZATION> analysis. These records were obtained by means of 30 pre-manufactured splints, handled by dentists without any experience in LDF<ORGANIZATION> recording. ( b ) Diurnal variations in one patient were analysed with LDF<ORGANIZATION> and FFT<ORGANIZATION> using 11 splints by one and same experienced investigator at four specific moments of the day. ( c ) Pulpal<PERSON> status was analysed using 17 splints. Eleven<PERSON> for a patient, standing as case model and six splints for six other patients. In this specific group, each patient had one vital and one non-vital central maxillary incisor and was analysed separately by LDF<ORGANIZATION> and FFT<ORGANIZATION>. The data of assessment ( b ) showed diurnal variations on LDF<ORGANIZATION> values of almost 80 %, indicating that LDF<ORGANIZATION> registration is best performed in the same time period of the day. Data<PERSON> verification with FFT<ORGANIZATION> confirmed the findings without FFT<ORGANIZATION> of assessment ( a ) and ( b ). In assessment, ( c ) FFT<ORGANIZATION> demonstrated a clear distinction between a vital and a non-vital pulp for those cases with one vital tooth and one root canal treated tooth. In those cases with one vital incisor and the other traumatised, FFT<ORGANIZATION> was undeterminated. Considered that FFT<ORGANIZATION> was obtained after LDF<ORGANIZATION> recording and remained undeterminated for a decision in cases with decreasing pulpal blood flow in time, the added value of FFT<ORGANIZATION> in pulpal traumatology was minimal.
