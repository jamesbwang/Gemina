 Mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR<ORGANIZATION> ) has been found to have significant health benefits in studies conducted in the global North<LOCATION>. This study examined the effects of MBSR<ORGANIZATION> on stress, mood states and medical symptoms among urban South Africans<GPE> to inform future research and clinical directions of MBSR<ORGANIZATION> in local settings. Participants<PERSON> completed an 8-week MBSR<ORGANIZATION> programme based in central Cape Town. A retrospective analysis of 276 clinical records was conducted. Mindfulness, stress, negative and positive mood, medical symptoms and psychological symptoms were assessed before and after the intervention using self-report questionnaires. We compared pre and postintervention scores and examined the relationship between changes in mindfulness and changes in stress, mood and medical symptoms. Mindfulness scores were significantly higher after intervention, both on the Kentucky<ORGANIZATION> Inventory of Mindfulness Skills<ORGANIZATION> ( KIMS<ORGANIZATION> ) and the Mindful<ORGANIZATION> Attention Awareness Scale ( MAAS<ORGANIZATION> ). Changes on the KIMS<ORGANIZATION> were associated with reductions in stress, negative mood, psychological symptoms and total medical symptoms, and improvement in positive mood. Changes in mindfulness, as measured by the MAAS<ORGANIZATION>, were significantly correlated only with reduced total number of medical symptoms. This study provides preliminary evidence for the positive health impact of MBSR<ORGANIZATION> on urban South Africans<GPE>, and in turn acceptability and feasibility evidence for MBSR<ORGANIZATION> in South Africa<GPE> and supports the case for larger trials in different local settings.
