 The structure of paramagnetic surface species is notoriously difficult to determine. For Ti<GPE> ( III<ORGANIZATION> ) centers related to Ziegler-Natta catalysis, we demonstrate here that detailed structural information can be obtained by advanced EPR<ORGANIZATION> spectroscopy and DFT<ORGANIZATION> computations, benchmarked on molecular analogues. The hyperfine sublevel correlation ( HYSCORE<ORGANIZATION> ) spectra obtained after reaction with 13C-labelled ethylene provides information about the coupling for a proton in the first coordination sphere of Ti<GPE> ( III<ORGANIZATION> ) as well as significant 13C hyperfine coupling and thereby allows structural assignment of the surface species.
