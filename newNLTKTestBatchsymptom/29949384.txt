 Background Patients on hemodialysis ( HD<ORGANIZATION> ) are at increased risk for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) dysfunction seems to participate in the arrhythmogenic process. Genetic factors have an impact on ANS modulation, but the specific role of the insertion/deletion ( I/D ) polymorphism in the gene for angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE<ORGANIZATION> ) had not been investigated. Since D<GPE> allele increases the gene expression, it is a candidate polymorphism to interact with the ANS<ORGANIZATION>. Objective To compare the dynamic profile of heart rate variability ( HRV<ORGANIZATION> ) during a HD session, a surrogate for the ANS<ORGANIZATION> response to stressors, between the ACE<ORGANIZATION> genotypes. Methods In a sample of chronic kidney disease patients, the I/D ACE genotypes were assessed with polymerase chain reaction, and the HRV<ORGANIZATION> was measured before, in the second hour, and after a HD session. The HRV<ORGANIZATION> parameters in the time and frequency domains were analyzed by repeated measures mixed models according to the time of measurement and the ACE<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism. Results HRV<PERSON> parameters in the frequency domain presented significantly different variation during the HD<ORGANIZATION> session between patients with or without the D allele. Only patients with II<ORGANIZATION> genotype presented increase in the low-frequency ( LF ) normalized units and in the LF/HF ratio, throughout HD<ORGANIZATION>. Conclusions Patients with II<ORGANIZATION> genotype seem to have a more physiological response to volemic and electrolytic changes occurring during HD, with greater sympathetic activation than patients with ID<ORGANIZATION> and DD<ORGANIZATION> genotypes.
