 Electromagnetic<GPE> fields ( EMF<ORGANIZATION> ) with different intensities are widely used at home, offices and public places.Today, there is a growing global concern about the effects of human exposure to EMFs<ORGANIZATION>. Epilepsy<PERSON> is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases, affecting 50 million people of all ages worldwide. We aimed to investigate the effect of exposure to Wi-Fi radiation on epileptic behavior of rats. 147 male rats, weighing 200-250 g, were divided into seven groups ; negative control ( no intervention ), sham 1 ( distilled water ), positive control ( Pentylentetrazol<ORGANIZATION> [ PTZ ] ), intervention group 1 ( PTZ<ORGANIZATION> + Wi-Fi `` off '' ), sham 2 ( distilled water + Wi-Fi `` off '' ), sham 3 ( distilled water + Wi-Fi `` on '' ), and intervention group 2 ( PTZ<ORGANIZATION> + Wi-Fi `` on '' ). The rats were exposed to Wi-Fi for 2h at a distance of 30cm from a commercial Wi-Fi router. Convulsive behaviors of rats were monitored and scored based on the intensity and type by measuring latency/threshold time, number of convulsions, sum of scores and durations of seizure, and duration of score 6 seizure. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to analyze the data. Convulsion was observed in interventions Group 4 and Group 7, and positive control. The mean number of events, and sum of scores were significantly different in intervention 2 than other two groups. However, the differences in mean threshold, mean sum of durations and `` time to show convulsion with score 6 `` were not statistically significant ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). Due to limitations of our study including the sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution. In this study, exposure to 2.4 GHz<ORGANIZATION> Wi-Fi radiation showed significant beneficial effects on the epileptic behaviour of rats. More experiments are needed to verify if these exposures can be used as a therapeutic approach for amelioration of seizures in epilepsy.
