 African<GSP> Americans<ORGANIZATION>, East Asians<GPE>, and Hispanics with systemic lupus erythematous ( SLE<ORGANIZATION> ) are more likely to develop lupus nephritis ( LN ) than are SLE<ORGANIZATION> patients of European<GPE> descent. The etiology of this difference is not clear, and this study was undertaken to investigate how genetic variants might explain this effect. In this cross-sectional study, 1244 SLE patients from multiethnic case collections were genotyped for 817,810 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ) across the genome. Continental<ORGANIZATION> genetic ancestry was estimated utilizing the program ADMIXTURE<ORGANIZATION>. Gene-based testing and pathway analysis was performed within each ethnic group and meta-analyzed across ethnicities. We also performed candidate SNP<ORGANIZATION> association tests with SNPs<ORGANIZATION> previously established as risk alleles for SLE<ORGANIZATION>, LN<ORGANIZATION>, and chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). Association testing and logistic regression models were performed with LN<ORGANIZATION> as the outcome, adjusted for continental ancestries, sex, disease duration, and age. We studied 255 North<GPE> European<GPE>, 263 South European<GPE>, 238 Hispanic, 224 African American<ORGANIZATION> and 264 East Asian<GPE> SLE<ORGANIZATION> patients, of whom 606 had LN ( 48.7 % ). In genome-wide gene-based and candidate SNP<ORGANIZATION> analyses, we found distinct genes, pathways and established risk SNPs<ORGANIZATION> associated with LN<ORGANIZATION> for each ethnic group. Gene-based analyses showed significant associations between variation in ZNF546<GPE> ( p = 1.0E-06 ), TRIM15<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 1.0E-06 ), and TRIMI0<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 1.0E-06 ) and LN<ORGANIZATION> among South Europeans<GPE>, and TTC34<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 8.0E-06 ) was significantly associated with LN<ORGANIZATION> among Hispanics. The SNP<ORGANIZATION> rs8091180 in NFATC1<GPE> was associated with LN<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 1.43, p = 3.3E-04 ) in the candidate SNP<ORGANIZATION> meta-analysis with the highest OR among African-Americans ( OR 2.17, p = 0.0035 ). Distinct<PERSON> genetic factors are associated with the risk of LN in SLE<ORGANIZATION> patients of different ethnicities. CKD<ORGANIZATION> risk alleles may play a role in the development of LN in addition to SLE-associated risk variants. These findings may further explain the clinical heterogeneity of LN<ORGANIZATION> risk and response to therapy observed between different ethnic groups.
