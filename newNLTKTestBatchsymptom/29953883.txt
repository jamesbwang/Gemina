 To provide insights into the long-term impact of radical retro-pubic prostatectomy ( ORRP<ORGANIZATION> ) on LUTS<ORGANIZATION> which are age and prostate dependent and adversely impact quality of life. 1,995 men undergoing ORRP<ORGANIZATION> enrolled in a prospective longitudinal outcomes study. The American Urological Association<ORGANIZATION> symptom index ( AUASI<ORGANIZATION> ) was self-administered before ORRP<ORGANIZATION> and at pre-determined time-points after surgery. A multivariate generalized linear model was used to evaluate the association of time since ORRP<ORGANIZATION> with AUASS<ORGANIZATION>. McNemar<ORGANIZATION> 's test and paired sample t-tests were used to assess whether the proportion of men with clinically significant LUTS<ORGANIZATION> ( CSLUTS<ORGANIZATION> ) defined by an American Urological Association<ORGANIZATION> symptom score ( AUASS<ORGANIZATION> ) > 7 or mean AUASS<ORGANIZATION> differed significantly between the time-dependent assessments, respectively. The 15 year mean adjusted AUASS<ORGANIZATION> was similar to baseline ( 7.00 vs. 6.85, p=0.66 ). Throughout the 15 years of follow-up, the proportion of men with CSLUTS<ORGANIZATION> was lower than baseline with the exception of the 3 month and 15 year assessments. Among men with baseline clinically insignificant LUTS<ORGANIZATION> ( CILUTS<ORGANIZATION> ), the mean adjusted AUASS<ORGANIZATION> at 15 years was significantly greater than baseline ( 6.09 vs. 3.19, p < 0.001 ). Among men with baseline CSLUTS<ORGANIZATION>, ORRP<ORGANIZATION> led to a significant decrease in mean adjusted AUASS<ORGANIZATION> between baseline and 15 years ( 13.26 vs. 8.67, p < 0.001 ). ORRP favorably affects the long-term natural history of LUTS<ORGANIZATION>. The long-term economic and quality of life benefits of ORRP<ORGANIZATION> on LUTS<ORGANIZATION> should inform the risks and benefits of RP<ORGANIZATION> for treatment of localized prostate cancer.
