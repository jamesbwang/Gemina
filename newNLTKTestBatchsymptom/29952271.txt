 Action<GPE> potential is a form of electric signaling responsibly for conducting neural firing in organisms. Voltage-gated sodium channels ( VGSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) are key molecules dedicating to the initiation and propagation of action potentials, playing an indispensable role in processing excitable activity. The foundational sensory of human covering vision, auditory, olfactory, taste and tactile perceive the outer world rely on normal physiological function of VGSCs<ORGANIZATION>, which play as a root dancing in music of life. The aberrant genetics and endogenous regulation of VGSCs<ORGANIZATION> in most cases give rise to related clinical symptom such as hyperpselaphesia, parosphresia, and so on. This review highlights recent advances in the study of VGSCs<ORGANIZATION> in sensory systems which may facilitate the fresh understanding of VGSCs<ORGANIZATION> in sensory information processing and provide a novel pharmacological target for treatment of sensory system related clinical disease.
