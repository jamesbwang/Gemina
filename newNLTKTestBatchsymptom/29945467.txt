 High rates of depression are observed in Parkinson<GPE> 's disease, and limited access to care complicates management. The purpose of this pilot project was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of a personalized cognitive-behavioral telemedicine program for depression in Parkinson<GPE> 's disease ( dPD<ORGANIZATION> ). Thirty-four individuals with dPD<ORGANIZATION> and their carepartners participated in this pilot study. A 10-module self-help workbook, tailored to the unique needs of the dPD<ORGANIZATION> population, was created to be used as either a stand-alone intervention, with minimal therapist support, or a supplement to formal telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions. Improvements in depression, anxiety, quality of life, sleep, negative thoughts, and caregiver burden were observed over the course of the 4-month study, independent of treatment modality ( guided self-help vs formal telephone-based psychotherapy ). Future<PERSON> research will utilize randomized controlled designs and continue to focus on delivery models that can improve access to this and other evidence-based mental health interventions for dPD<ORGANIZATION>.
