 Mammary epithelial cells ( MEC<ORGANIZATION> ) are exfoliated from the epithelium into milk, influencing the number of MEC<ORGANIZATION> present in the udder. This process is associated with epithelium integrity. The release of oxytocin ( OT ) induced by milking causes myoepithelial cell contraction, which, in turn, may stimulate MEC<ORGANIZATION> exfoliation through mechanical forces. To investigate the role of OT in MEC<ORGANIZATION> exfoliation, we inhibited or induced myoepithelial cell contraction by injecting the OT<ORGANIZATION> receptor antagonist atosiban ( Ato<ORGANIZATION> ) or a supraphysiological dose of OT<ORGANIZATION>, respectively. Eight cows were assigned to 2 treatments during 2 milkings according to a crossover experimental design: Control+OT ( cows were first milked to collect standard milk and then received 5 IU of OT to collect residual milk through a second milking ) and Ato<ORGANIZATION> + OT ( cows were injected with Ato<GPE> ( 50 Î¼g/kg of body weight ) and milked to collect cisternal milk, then received 5 IU of OT to collect alveolar milk through a second milking ). Milk MEC<PERSON> were purified to determine their concentration and number in milk. Mammary epithelium integrity was assessed by measuring the kinetics of plasma lactose concentration. Inhibiting myoepithelial cell contraction by Ato<ORGANIZATION> injection decreased the number of exfoliated MEC in milk. In contrast, OT<ORGANIZATION> injection increased the concentration of MEC<ORGANIZATION> in the residual milk and the number of MEC<ORGANIZATION> in the alveolar milk. Ato<PERSON> injection reduced plasma lactose concentration, whereas, in both treatments, OT<ORGANIZATION> injections increased it. Our results suggested that myoepithelial cell contraction caused by OT<ORGANIZATION> could stimulate MEC<ORGANIZATION> exfoliation into milk and was associated with epithelium disruption.
