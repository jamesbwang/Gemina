 Visceral artery aneurysms are rare with an incidence of only 0.01-0.1 % of the population. Open surgical or endovascular elimination should be performed for aneurysms greater than 2 cm in size. The risk of aneurysm rupture is then approximately 25-40 %. If the aneurysm ruptures the mortality can be as high as 76 %. For mycotic aneurysms or spurious aneurysms there is no lower limit to the diameter size for the need of treatment. Sudden<PERSON> abdominal pain during pregnancy can be caused by visceral artery aneurysms and must be further clarified. The indications for surgery during pregnancy should be made generously. The clinical symptoms ( abdominal complaints ) of visceral artery aneurysms are manifold. The treatment can be either an open surgical approach or endovascular treatment. In the emergency setting, if endovascular treatment is no longer possible, an open surgical treatment needs to be performed. There are so far no randomized studies which could identify one of the procedures ( open surgery vs. endovascular surgery ) as clearly being superior. The prognosis after treatment is satisfactory with a 5-10 year survival rate of approximately 90 %.
