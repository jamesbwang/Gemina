 Individuals with spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA<ORGANIZATION> ) type 3 are able to walk but they have weakness, gait impairments and fatigue. Our primary study objective was to examine longitudinal changes in the six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) and to evaluate whether age and SMA<ORGANIZATION> type 3 subtype are associated with decline in ambulatory function. Data from three prospective natural history studies were used. Seventy-three participants who performed the 6MWT more than once, at least 6 months apart, were included ; follow-up ranged from 0.5-9 years. Only data from patients who completed the 6MWT were included. The mean age of the participants was 13.5 years ( range 2.6-49.1 ), with 52 having disease onset before age 3 years ( type 3A ). At baseline, type 3A participants walked a shorter distance on average ( 257.1 m ) than type 3B participants ( 390.2 m ) ( difference = 133.1 m, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 71.8-194.3, p < 0.001 ). Distance<PERSON> walked was weakly associated with age ( r = 0.25, p = 0.04 ). Linear<PERSON> mixed effects models were used to estimate the mean annual rate of change. The overall mean rate of change was -7.8 m/year ( 95 % CI -13.6 -- 2.0, p = 0.009 ) and this did not differ by subtype ( type 3A: -8.5 m/year, type 3B: -6.6 m/year, p = 0.78 ), but it did differ by age group ( < 6: 9.8 m/year ; 6-10: -7.9 m/year ; 11-19: -20.8 m/year ; â‰¥ 20: -9.7 m/year ; p = 0.005 ). Our results showed an overall decline on the 6MWT over time, but different trajectories were observed depending on age. Young<PERSON> ambulant SMA<ORGANIZATION> patients gain function but in adolescence, patients lose function. Future clinical trials in ambulant SMA<ORGANIZATION> patients should consider in their design the different trajectories of ambulatory function over time, based on age.
