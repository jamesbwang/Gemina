 Streptococcal bacterial species represent common inhabitants of the intestinal tract of animals and humans with a potential for opportunistic infections. Streptococcosis<PERSON> has been identified in turkey poults ( Meleagris<ORGANIZATION> gallopavo ), ducklings and goslings ( Anatidae ), broiler chickens, semimature-adult chickens ( Gallus<ORGANIZATION> gallus domesticus ), and young and adult pigeons ( Columbidae<ORGANIZATION> ). However, the exact underlying factors that lead to bacterial invasion of the blood stream and tissue colonization have not been completely elucidated. The electronic database of the California<GPE> Animal Health and Food Safety<PERSON> laboratory ( Fresno<GPE>, Tulare<GPE>, and Turlock<GPE> branches ) was searched for necropsy cases in which streptococcosis was diagnosed in different avian species between January 2000 and August 2017. A total of 95 cases, involving both commercial operations and noncommercial premises, were analyzed. Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus<GPE> bovis, and Streptococcus<GPE> gallolyticus were identified from multiple organs, with macroscopic or histopathologic lesions ( or both ) indicative of septicemia in 23 ( 24 % ), 40 ( 42 % ), and 30 ( 32 % ) cases, respectively. Streptococcus pluranimalium and Streptococcus<GPE> lutetiensis were also isolated from one ( 1 % ) and two ( 2 % ) cases, respectively. Turkey<GPE> poults, broiler chickens, and ducklings were the most-commonly affected species with streptococcosis. Splenitis<PERSON> and hepatitis were the most-common lesions observed and these were the organs with the highest isolation rate. An overview of the clinical and pathologic presentation, and possible predisposing conditions associated with this bacterial infection, is provided.
