 Multiple<GPE> states have laws requiring abortion facilities to meet ambulatory surgery center ( ASC<ORGANIZATION> ) standards. There is limited evidence regarding abortion-related morbidities and adverse events following abortions performed at ASCs<ORGANIZATION> vs office-based settings. To compare abortion-related morbidities and adverse events at ASCs<ORGANIZATION> vs office-based settings. Retrospective cohort study of women with US<GSP> private health insurance who underwent induced abortions in an ASC<ORGANIZATION> or office-based setting ( January 1, 2011-December 31, 2014 ). Outcomes were abstracted from a large national private insurance claims database during the 6 weeks following the abortion ( date of final follow-up, February 11, 2015 ). Facility type for abortion ( ASCs<ORGANIZATION> vs office-based settings, including facilities such as abortion clinics, nonspecialized clinics, and physician offices ). The primary outcome was any abortion-related morbidity or adverse event ( such as retained products of conception, abortion-related infection, hemorrhage, and uterine perforation ) within 6 weeks after an abortion. Two secondary outcomes, both subsets of the primary outcome, were major abortion-related morbidities and adverse events ( such as hemorrhages treated with a transfusion, missed ectopic pregnancies treated with surgery, and abortion-related infections that resulted in an overnight hospital admission ) and abortion-related infections. Among 49 287 women ( mean age, 28 years [ SD, 7.3 ] ) who had 50 311 induced abortions, ( 23 891 [ 47 % ] first-trimester aspiration, 13 480 [ 27 % ] first-trimester medication, and 12 940 [ 26 % ] second trimester or later ), 5660 abortions ( 11 % ) were performed in ASCs<ORGANIZATION> and 44 651 ( 89 % ) in office-based settings. Overall, 3.33 % had an abortion-related morbidity or adverse event ; 0.32 % had a major abortion-related morbidity or adverse event ; and 0.74 % had an abortion-related infection. In adjusted analyses, there was no statistically significant difference between ASCs<ORGANIZATION> vs office-based settings, respectively, in the rates of abortion-related morbidities or adverse events ( 3.25 % vs 3.33 %, difference, -0.8 % ; 95 % CI, -0.58 % to 0.43 % ; adjusted OR, 0.97 ; 95 % CI, 0.81-1.17 ), major morbidities or adverse events ( 0.26 % vs 0.33 % ; difference, -0.06 % ; 95 % CI, -0.18 % to 0.06 % ; adjusted OR, 0.78 ; 95 % CI, 0.45-1.37 ), or infections ( 0.58 % vs 0.77 % ; difference, -0.16 % ; 95 % CI, -0.35 % to 0.03 % ; adjusted OR, 0.75 ; 95 % CI, 0.52-1.09 ). Among women with private health insurance who had an induced abortion, performance of the abortion in an ambulatory surgical center compared with an office-based setting was not associated with a significant difference in abortion-related morbidities and adverse events. These findings, in addition to individual patient and individual facility factors, may inform decisions about the type of facility in which induced abortions are performed.
