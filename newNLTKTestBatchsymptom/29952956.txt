 This study aimed to investigate the difference of common adverse events ( AEs<ORGANIZATION> ) between patients experienced first drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization ( DEB-TACE ; FD ) and second or higher DEB-TACE ( SHD<ORGANIZATION> ), and the factors influencing AEs.Five hundred twenty DEB-TACE records were retrospectively reviewed in this cohort study, among which 284 and 236 records were in FD and SHD<ORGANIZATION> groups, respectively. The incidence and/or severity of pain, fever, vomiting, and increased blood pressure ( BP ) were collected.Pain numerical rating scale ( NRS<ORGANIZATION> ) score, pain severity, body temperature, fever severity, and fever lasting days were higher in FD<ORGANIZATION> group than in SHD<ORGANIZATION> group, while no difference of vomiting and increased BP between 2 groups were disclosed. Age â‰¥65 years was associated with decreased high fever and less possibility of vomiting in FD<ORGANIZATION> group, and lower pain and fever severity in SHD<ORGANIZATION> group ; Male<PERSON> decreased the possibility of vomiting in both the groups, and reduced increased BP incidence in SHD<ORGANIZATION> group ; diabetes history correlated with decreased pain degree and less fever in FD<GPE> group.In conclusion, SHD<ORGANIZATION> was better tolerated compared with FD<ORGANIZATION> in liver cancer patients, and older age as well as male were correlated with less occurrence or severity of common AEs in DEB-TACE operation.
