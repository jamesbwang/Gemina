 To evaluate the relation between yogurt consumption as well as cheese, milk, and total dairy, and high blood pressure ( HBP<ORGANIZATION> ) in two Nurses ' Health Study<PERSON> cohorts ( NHS<ORGANIZATION>, n = 69 298 ), NHS<ORGANIZATION> II ( n = 84 368 ) and the Health Professionals<ORGANIZATION> Follow-Up Study ( HPFS<ORGANIZATION>, n = 30 512 ). NHS<ORGANIZATION>, NHS<ORGANIZATION> II, and HPFS<ORGANIZATION> participants were followed for incident HBP<ORGANIZATION> for up to 30, 20, and 24 years, respectively. Hazard<PERSON> ratios were calculated using time-dependent multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Pooled risk estimates were derived from fixed effects meta-analyses. Participants consuming at least five servings per week ( vs. < 1 serving per month ) of yogurt in NHS<ORGANIZATION>, NHS<ORGANIZATION> II, and HPFS<ORGANIZATION> had 19 % ( 95 % CI 0.75-0.87 ), 17 % ( 95 % CI 0.77-0.90 ), and 6 % ( 95 % CI 0.83-1.07 ) lower HBP<ORGANIZATION> risks, respectively. In pooled analyses of these cohorts, higher yogurt consumption was linked with 16 % ( 95 % CI 0.80-0.88 ) lower HBP<ORGANIZATION> risk ; higher total dairy ( 3 to < 6 vs. < 0.5 servings/day ), milk ( 2 to < 6/day vs. < 4/week ) and cheese ( 1 to 4/day vs. < 1/week ) were associated with 16 % ( 95 % CI 0.81-0.87 ), 12 % ( 95 % CI 0.86-0.90 ), and 6 % ( 95 % CI 0.90-0.97 ) lower HBP<ORGANIZATION> risks, respectively. After controlling for BMI<ORGANIZATION> as a possible causal intermediate, total dairy, yogurt, milk, and cheese were associated with 13, 10, 8, and 8 % lower HBP<ORGANIZATION> risks, respectively. The combination of higher yogurt intake and higher DASH<ORGANIZATION> ( 'Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension<PERSON> ' ) diet scores was associated with 30 % ( 95 % CI 0.66-0.75 ) lower HBP<ORGANIZATION> risk compared with lower levels of both factors. Higher total dairy intake, especially in the form of yogurt, was associated with lower risk of incident HBP in middle-aged and older adult men and women.
