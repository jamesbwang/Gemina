 Executive<GPE> dysfunctions are a frequently described non-motor symptom in patients with Parkinson<PERSON> 's disease ( PD ). However, the nature, extent, variability, and determinants of executive dysfunctions in PD are still poorly understood. To improve the characterization of executive dysfunctions in PD<GPE>, we conducted a meta-analysis of the studies administering the Wisconsin Card<ORGANIZATION> Sorting Test ( WCST<ORGANIZATION> ) to patients with PD<ORGANIZATION> and healthy controls. We included k = 161 studies, which allowed us to precisely estimate the size of PD-related WCST deficits and to run powerful tests for potential moderators of these deficits. We found robust WCST<ORGANIZATION> deficits in PD<GPE>, which were medium-to-large in size. These deficits were most pronounced in patients tested after withdrawal from dopaminergic medication and in samples characterized by severe motor impairment and long disease duration. Substantial WCST<ORGANIZATION> impairment was also detected in non-demented, non-depressed, and never-medicated patients with PD<ORGANIZATION> as well as after conservatively correcting for publication bias. Based on these findings, impaired WCST<ORGANIZATION> performance can be considered as a major hallmark of executive dysfunction in PD.
