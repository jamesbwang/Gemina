 Time<PERSON> restricted feeding decreases energy intake without calorie counting and may be a viable option for weight loss. However, the effect of this diet on body weight in obese subjects has never been examined. This study investigated the effects of 8-h time restricted feeding on body weight and metabolic disease risk factors in obese adults. Obese subjects ( Body<ORGANIZATION> weight and energy intake decreased in the time restricted group ( -2.6 % ± 0.5 ; -341 ± 53 kcal/d ) relative to controls over 12 weeks ( These findings suggest that 8-h time restricted feeding produces mild caloric restriction and weight loss, without calorie counting. It may also offer clinical benefits by reducing blood pressure.
