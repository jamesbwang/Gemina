 Steroid-induced ocular hypertension ( SIOH<ORGANIZATION> ) is a challenging entity in paediatric age, with many being refractory to medical therapy. Literature is scarce about surgical options in these cases. A 14-year-old girl with bilateral uveitis and macular oedema had received an intravitreal and subconjunctival triamcinolone injection in the right ( OD ) and left ( OS ) eye, respectively. While the steroid was effective in resolving the oedema, intraocular pressure ( IOP<ORGANIZATION> ) increased to about 40 mm Hg OD and 34 mm Hg OS, despite being under maximal IOP-lowering therapy. An initial conservative approach was preferred due to the young patient age and given that most cases of SIOH<ORGANIZATION> are transient. However, progressive structural changes were documented, and bilateral sequential minimally invasive glaucoma surgery ( MIGS<ORGANIZATION>: XEN gel stent ) was taken. With a follow-up of 6 months, the patient is drug-free with IOP<ORGANIZATION> around 14 mm Hg. This report discusses the role and efficacy of MIGS<ORGANIZATION> in a paediatric case of SIOH<ORGANIZATION>.
