 Chicken<GPE> body weight ( BW ) is an economically important trait, and many studies have been conducted on genetic selection for BW<ORGANIZATION>. However, previous studies have detected functional chromosome mutations or regions using gene chips. The present study used the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing ( SLAF-seq ) technology to perform a genome-wide association study ( GWAS<ORGANIZATION> ) on purebred Wengshang Barred<PERSON> chicken. A total of 1,286,715 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ) were detected, and 175,211 SNPs were selected as candidate SNPs<ORGANIZATION> for genome-wide association analysis using TASSEL<ORGANIZATION> general linear models. Six SNP<PERSON> markers reached genome-wide significance. Of these, rs732048524, rs735522839, rs738991545, and rs15837818 were significantly associated with body weight at 28 days ( BW28<ORGANIZATION> ), while rs314086457 and rs315694878 were significantly associated with BW120<ORGANIZATION>. These SNPs are close to seven genes ( PRSS23<ORGANIZATION>, ME3<ORGANIZATION>, FAM181B<ORGANIZATION>, NABP1<ORGANIZATION>, SDPR<ORGANIZATION>, TSSK6L2<ORGANIZATION>, and RBBP8<ORGANIZATION> ). Moreover, 24 BW-associated SNPs<ORGANIZATION> reached `` suggestive '' genome-wide significance. Of these, 6, 13, 1, and 4 SNPs were associated with BW28<ORGANIZATION>, BW56<ORGANIZATION>, BW80<ORGANIZATION>, and BW120<ORGANIZATION>, respectively. These results would enrich the studies on BW and promote the use of Chinese<GPE> chicken, especially the Wenshang Barred<ORGANIZATION> chicken.
