 The established role of hypoxia-induced signaling in prostate cancer growth, metastasis, and response to treatment suggests that a method to image hypoxia in tumors could aid treatment decisions. Here we present consumption and supply-based hypoxia ( CSH<ORGANIZATION> ) imaging, an approach that integrates images related to oxygen consumption and supply into a single image. This integration algorithm was developed in prostate cancer patients receiving hypoxia marker pimonidazole prior to prostatectomy. We exploited the intravoxel incoherent motion ( IVIM<ORGANIZATION> ) signal in diagnostic diffusion-weighted ( DW ) magnetic resonance ( MR ) images to generate separate images of the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC<ORGANIZATION> ) and fractional blood volume ( fBV<ORGANIZATION> ). ADC<ORGANIZATION> and fBV correlated with cell density ( CD ) and blood vessel density ( BVD<ORGANIZATION> ) in histology and whole-mount sections from 35 patients, thus linking ADC<ORGANIZATION> to oxygen consumption and fBV<ORGANIZATION> to oxygen supply. Pixel-wise plots of ADC<ORGANIZATION> versus fBV were utilized to predict the hypoxia status of each pixel in a tumor and visualize the predicted value in a single image. The hypoxic fraction ( HFDWI<ORGANIZATION> ) of CSH<ORGANIZATION> images correlated strongly ( R2=0.66 ; n=41 ) with pimonidazole immunoscore ( HSPimo<ORGANIZATION> ) ; this relationship was validated in a second pimonidazole cohort ( R2=0.54 ; n=54 ). We observed good agreement between CSH<ORGANIZATION> images and pimonidazole staining in whole-mount sections. HFDWI<ORGANIZATION> correlated with tumor stage and lymph node status, consistent with findings for HSPimo<ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, CSH<ORGANIZATION> imaging could be applied on histological CD and BVD<ORGANIZATION> images, demonstrating transferability to a histopathology assay. Thus, CSH<ORGANIZATION> represents a robust approach for hypoxia imaging in prostate cancer that could easily be translated into clinical practice.
