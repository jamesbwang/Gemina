 In severely injured patients, trauma-induced coagulopathy ( TIC<ORGANIZATION> ) present at hospital admission is associated with increased transfusion requirements, morbidity and mortality. Early and effective treatment contributes to improved survival rates. Laboratory<PERSON> coagulation assays have long turn-around times and evidence for their usefulness, especially in the context of TIC<ORGANIZATION>, is weak. Due to the lack of appropriate guidance, transfusion of allogeneic blood products frequently follows a ratio-based concept ( e.g., transfusion of erythrocytes and plasma in a 1: 1 ratio ). Point-of-care ( PoC<ORGANIZATION> ) tests enable the assessment of prothrombin time ( PT ) and activated partial thromboplastin time in few minutes. However, although normal PT in these tests allows to rule out relevant effects of several anticoagulants, they are not able to detect patients with TIC<ORGANIZATION> and/or requiring subsequent massive transfusion. Viscoelastic tests ( VETs<ORGANIZATION> ) make it possible to assess defects in thrombin generation, hypofibrinogenaemia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperfibrinolysis, and thus enable targeted therapy. Impairment of platelet function is the common blind spot not detectable using both standard laboratory-based tests and VETs<ORGANIZATION>. However, PoC<ORGANIZATION> platelet function tests enable to detect platelet defects and patients taking anti-platelet. Furthermore, impaired platelet function has been identified as a strong predictor for coagulopathy and massive transfusion in trauma patients. In other clinical settings, coagulation management based on VETs<ORGANIZATION> is associated with decreased transfusion requirements, incidence of acute kidney failure, and mortality, respectively. Data of the first small prospective randomised trial indicate superiority of VET<ORGANIZATION> guided coagulation management solely using coagulation factor concentrates, when compared to plasma transfusions in severe trauma.
