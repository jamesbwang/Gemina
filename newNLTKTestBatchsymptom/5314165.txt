 To determine the prevalence of color vision deficiency ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ) among first-cycle students of the Faculty<ORGANIZATION> of Medicine<GPE> and Biomedical Sciences<ORGANIZATION> of the University<ORGANIZATION> of Yaoundé I. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out between October 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016. Distant<PERSON> visual acuity was measured and color vision test done for all consenting students. Ishihara<PERSON> 's plates were used to test all the participants. Those who failed the test were tested with the Roth<ORGANIZATION> 's 28 Hue test for confirmation of CVD<ORGANIZATION> and classification. A total of 303 students were included, among whom 155 were males ( 50.8 % ) and 148 were females ( 49.2 % ). The mean age was 20.2±2 years. Five students ( 1.6 % ) failed the Ishihara<ORGANIZATION> 's plate testing. Roth<PERSON> 's 28 Hue test confirmed CVD<ORGANIZATION> in 4 of those cases, giving a prevalence of 1.3 %. There were equal numbers of protan and deutan CVD<ORGANIZATION>. Despite its low prevalence among first-cycle students of the Faculty<ORGANIZATION> of Medicine<GPE> and Biomedical Sciences<ORGANIZATION>, CVD<ORGANIZATION> screening should be performed in order to raise awareness, which will go a long way to help orientate the choice of future specialty.
