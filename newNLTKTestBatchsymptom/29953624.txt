 Atrial<GPE> arrhythmias, particularly atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, can coexist with drug-induced type 1 Brugada ECG<PERSON> pattern ( DI-Type1-BrP ). The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of DI-Type1-BrP in patients with atrioventricular accessory pathways ( AV-APs ) and to investigate the clinical, electrocardiographic, electrophysiologic and genetic characteristics of these patients. One-hundred-twenty-four consecutive cases of AV-APs and 84 controls underwent an ajmaline challenge test to unmask DI-Type1-BrP. Genetic<PERSON> screening and analysis was performed in 55 of the cases ( 19 with and 36 without DI-Type1-BrP ). Patients with AV-APs were significantly more likely than controls to have a Type1-BrP unmasked ( 16.1 versus 4.8 %, p = 0.012 ). At baseline, patients with DI-Type1-BrP had higher prevalence of chest pain, QR/rSr ' pattern in V<GPE> DI-Type1-BrP is relatively common in patients with AV-APs. We identify 12-lead ECG<ORGANIZATION> characteristics during pre-excitation and orthodromic AVRT that point to an underlying type1-BrP, portending an increased probability for development of malignant arrhythmias.
