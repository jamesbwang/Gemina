 [ Purpose<PERSON> ] The purpose of this study was to clarify the differences in ventilation mechanics between quiet breathing and expiratory rib cage compression, and between expiratory rib cage compression on the upper rib cage and on the lower rib cage. [ Subjects and Methods<ORGANIZATION> ] Subjects comprised 6 healthy males. Expiratory rib cage compression was performed manually by compressing the upper and lower rib cages. Changes in the lung volume, flow rate, and esophageal and gastric pressure were examined. [ Results<PERSON> ] The end expiratory lung volume was significantly lower during expiratory rib cage compression than at rest, but the end inspiratory lung volume was not significantly different. When compared with the esophageal and gastric pressures on the upper and lower rib cages at rest, the gastric pressures were significantly higher at end expiration. Lung<PERSON> resistance was significantly higher during expiratory rib cage compression than at rest. [ Conclusion<ORGANIZATION> ] Although expiratory rib cage compression promoted expiration and increased tidal volume, the lung volume did not increase beyond end inspiratory levels at rest. Lung<PERSON> resistance may increase during expiratory rib cage compression due to a decrease in lung volume. The mechanism by which expiration is promoted differed between the upper and lower rib cages.
