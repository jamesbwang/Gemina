 FAT10<GPE>, which is also known as diubiquitin, has been implicated to play important roles in immune regulation and tumorigenesis. Its expression is up-regulated in the tumors of Hepatocellular Carcinoma<PERSON> ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ) and other cancer patients. High levels of FAT10<ORGANIZATION> in cells have been shown to result in increased mitotic non-disjunction and chromosome instability, leading to tumorigenesis. To evaluate whether the aberrant up-regulation of the FAT10<ORGANIZATION> gene in the tumors of HCC<ORGANIZATION> patients is due to mutations or the aberrant methylation of CG<ORGANIZATION> dinucleotides at the FAT10<ORGANIZATION> promoter, sequencing and methylation-specific sequencing of the promoter of FAT10<ORGANIZATION> was performed. No mutations were found that could explain the differential expression of FAT10<ORGANIZATION> between the tumor and non-tumorous tissues of HCC<ORGANIZATION> patients. However, six single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ), including one that has not been previously reported, were identified at the promoter of the FAT10<ORGANIZATION> gene. Different haplotypes of these SNPs were found to significantly mediate different FAT10<ORGANIZATION> promoter activities. Consistent with the experimental observation, differential FAT10<ORGANIZATION> expression in the tumors of HCC<ORGANIZATION> patients carrying haplotype 1 was generally higher than those carrying haplotype II. Notably, the methylation status of this promoter was found to correlate with FAT10<ORGANIZATION> expression levels. Hence<PERSON>, the aberrant overexpression of the FAT10<ORGANIZATION> gene in the tumors of HCC<ORGANIZATION> patients is likely due to aberrant methylation, rather than mutations at the FAT10<ORGANIZATION> promoter.
