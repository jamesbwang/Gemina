 Chinese<GPE> medicine Buyang Huanwu<PERSON> decoction ( BYHW<ORGANIZATION> ) is widely used in treating cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome, but the pharmacological basis is still not clear. This study aims to uncover the biological basis of BYHW<ORGANIZATION> therapy for cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome using label-free proteomic technology. Using Qi deficiency and blood stasis rat cerebral infarction model as the research object, the protein expression of rat brain tissue was compared among the sham operation group, the model group and the drug group. Quantitative analysis of the 3 groups of tissue samples detected 3 959, 3 996 and 4 055 proteins in the sham operation group, the model group and the drug group, respectively. Take model group as the control group, 391 proteins were identified to be upregulated or downregulated for more than 2 folds. Biological analysis and functional enrichment of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that BYHW<ORGANIZATION> may treat cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome through energy metabolism, nervous system and several signal pathways. This study preliminarily revealed the pharmacological mechanism of BYHW<ORGANIZATION> at the protein level, and provided a molecular basis for clinical treatment and traditional Chinese<GPE> medicine research on cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome.
