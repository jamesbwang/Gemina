 To date, exhaustive gene expression analyses of chondrocytes in hip osteoarthritis ( OA ) have yielded specific gene expression patterns. No study has reported on the exhaustive transcriptome of secondary hip OA based on acetabular dysplasia in a Japanese<GPE> population, while previous reports have focused on primary or idiopathic hip OA in Caucasian<GPE> populations. This study aims to search for specific gene expression patterns of secondary hip OA chondrocytes by transcriptome analysis. Human<PERSON> articular cartilage was obtained from femoral heads following hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture ( N = 8 ; non-OA ) and total hip arthroplasty for secondary hip OA ( N = 12 ). Total RNA<PERSON> was extracted from the articular cartilage and submitted for microarray analysis. The obtained data were used to perform gene expression analysis, GO<ORGANIZATION> enrichment analysis and pathway analysis and were compared with data from primary hip OA in Caucasian<GPE> populations in the literature. We identified 888 upregulated ( fold change: FC ≥ 2 ) and 732 downregulated ( FC<ORGANIZATION> ≤ 0.5 ) genes in hip OA versus non-OA chondrocytes, respectively. Only 10 % of upregulated genes were common between the secondary and primary OA. The newly found genes prominently overexpressed in the secondary hip OA chondrocytes were DPT<ORGANIZATION>, IGFBP7<ORGANIZATION>, and KLF2<ORGANIZATION>. Pathway<PERSON> analysis revealed extracellular matrix ( ECM<ORGANIZATION> ) -receptor interaction as an OA-related pathway, which was similar to previous reports in primary hip OA. This is the first study to report the genome-wide transcriptome of secondary hip OA chondrocytes and demonstrates new potential OA-related genes. Gene expression patterns were different between secondary and primary hip OA, although the results of pathway and functional analysis were similar.
