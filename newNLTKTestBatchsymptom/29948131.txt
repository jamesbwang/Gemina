 Genetic<GPE> variations of genes encoding the endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS<ORGANIZATION> ) and the NADH/NADPH oxidase system are related with atherosclerosis in the general population, but their significance in women is not sufficiently assessed. We investigated the potential association between the G894T<GPE> polymorphism of the NOS3<ORGANIZATION> gene and the C242T<GPE> polymorphism of the CYBA<ORGANIZATION> gene with subclinical vascular disease. Seventy ( 70 ) healthy, normally ovulating, premenopausal women were recruited for this study. Venous<PERSON> blood samples were obtained for biochemical/hormonal assessment as well as for genotyping, using real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION>. Sonographically<PERSON> assessed indices of vascular structure and function included carotid and femoral intima-media thickness ( IMT<ORGANIZATION> ), flow-mediated dilation ( FMD<ORGANIZATION> ), carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity ( PWV<ORGANIZATION> ), and augmentation index. The prevalence of wild type, heterozygote, and homozygote genotype was 44.3 % ( 31/70 ), 54.3 % ( 38/70 ), and 1.4 % ( 1/70 ) for the G894T<GPE> polymorphism and 38.6 % ( 27/70 ), 31.4 % ( 22/70 ), and 30.0 % ( 21/70 ) for the C242T<GPE> polymorphism, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, the hC242T<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism was a predictor of both internal carotid IMT<ORGANIZATION> ( b-coefficient - 0.119, p = 0.011 ) and combined-IMT ( b-coefficient - 0.061, p = 0.015 ). Systolic blood pressure, lipids, and hC242T<ORGANIZATION> determined values of FMD<ORGANIZATION> ( b-coefficient - 1.604, p = 0.034 ). Concerning the NOS3 G894T<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism, carriers of the polymorphic variant had higher values of IMT<ORGANIZATION> and PWV<ORGANIZATION> compared to the wild-type subgroup ( carotid bulb-IMT and PWV<ORGANIZATION>, heterozygotes/homozygotes vs wild type 0.7 ± 0.2 vs 0.6 ± 0.1 mm ; 7.1 ± 0.8 vs 6.6 ± 0.7 m/s ; p = 0.048 and p = 0.029, respectively ). These differences, however, were rendered non-significant in the multivariable analysis. In healthy premenopausal women, the CYBA C242T<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism is an independent determinant of endothelial function and subclinical atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries. The NOS3 G894T<ORGANIZATION> polymorphic variant also correlated with atherosclerosis, an association probably mediated by the traditional risk factors for CVD<ORGANIZATION>. The relevance of these findings in the clinical setting remains to be elucidated.
