 The pharmacokinetic ( PK ) properties of enrofloxacin ( ENR<ORGANIZATION> ) and its metabolite ciprofloxacin ( CIP<ORGANIZATION> ) were investigated in crucian carp following oral administration at different dose levels ( 5, 10, 20, 40 mg/kg body weight ). The disposition kinetics of ENR<ORGANIZATION> was found to be linear over the dose range studied. Serum half-lives ranged from 64.56 to 72.68 hr. The in vitro and ex vivo activities of ENR<ORGANIZATION> in serum against a pathogenic strain of Aeromonas<GPE> hydrophila were determined. In vitro and ex vivo bactericidal activity of ENR<ORGANIZATION> was concentration dependent. Dosing of 10 mg/kg resulted in an AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC<ORGANIZATION> ) ratio of 368.92 hr and a C
