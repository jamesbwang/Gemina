 Robot-assisted rehabilitation therapy of the upper extremity after stroke has been studied widely ; however, robotic devices remain expensive and bulky. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a newly developed, compact upper extremity training system ( Neuro-X® ) in patients with chronic stroke. Pilot<PERSON> study. Fifteen patients with hemiplegia. Chronic patients with stroke underwent upper extremity training using a newly developed upper extremity training system ( Neuro-X® ; Apsun Inc.<PERSON>, Seoul<GPE>, Korea<GPE> ). Patients were evaluated using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA<ORGANIZATION> ), Hand Function Test<PERSON> ( HFT<ORGANIZATION> ), Modified Ashworth Scale<PERSON> ( MAS<ORGANIZATION> ), and Korean<PERSON> Mini-Mental Status Evaluation ( K-MMSE ). The assessment started with `` pre 1 evaluation '' ( A1 ), followed by repeated `` pre 2 evaluation '' ( A2 ) after 6 weeks without receiving any treatment, in order to generate repeated baseline data. After the A2 evaluation, upper extremity training was performed for 6 weeks. Post-training evaluation ( B ) was performed after treatment. Obtained data ( A1-A2-B ) were compared. During the non-intervention phase ( A1 to A2<GPE> ), no significant changes were found in the aforementioned evaluations. However, in the intervention phase ( A2 to B ), results of the FMA<ORGANIZATION> and HFT<ORGANIZATION>, and K-MMSE scores, except the MAS<ORGANIZATION> score, increased significantly ( p < 0.05 ). The Neuro-X® training system improves functioning of the upper extremity and cognition in patients with stroke after 6 weeks of training.
