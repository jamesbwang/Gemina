 There are no instruments evaluating the processes and outcomes of dying care right before and after death. Therefore, we developed and examined the validity and reliability of 2 scales for evaluating dying care processes and outcomes before and after death. A cross-sectional, anonymous questionnaire was administered to bereaved family members of patients with cancer who had died in 5 facilities. We evaluated the Dying Care Process Scale<PERSON> for Bereaved Family Members<PERSON> ( DPS-B ) and the Dying Care Outcome Scale for Bereaved Family Members<PERSON> ( DOS-B ) with 345 bereaved family members. A factor analysis revealed that DPS-B and DOS-B each consisted of 4 subscales. For the DPS-B, they were `` symptom management, '' `` respect for the patient 's dignity before and after death, '' `` explanation to the family, '' and `` family care. '' For the DOS-B, they were `` peaceful dying process for the patient, '' `` being respected as a person before and after death, '' `` good relationship between the patient and family, '' and `` peaceful dying process for the family. '' Both DPS-B and DOS-B had sufficient convergent and discriminative validity, sufficient internal consistency ( DPS-B: α = 0.91 and subscales ' αs = 0.78-0.91 ; DOS-B: α = 0.91 and subscales ' αs = 0.78-0.94 ), and sufficient test-retest reliability ( DPS-B: intraclass correlation coefficient [ ICC ] of total score = 0.79 and subscales = 0.55-0.79 ; DOS-B: ICC of total score = 0.88 and subscales = 0.70-0.88 ). Both DPS-B and DOS-B are valid and reliable scales for evaluating the dying care processes and outcomes before and after death from the bereaved family members ' perspectives.
