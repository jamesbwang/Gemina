 Multilocular thymic cysts ( MTCs<ORGANIZATION> ) associated with thymomas or thymic carcinomas ( TCs<ORGANIZATION> ) are rare and may be misdiagnosed as other benign cystic lesions. We retrospectively analysed 18 cases of thymomas or TCs<ORGANIZATION> associated with MTCs<ORGANIZATION>, which were retrieved from 309 consecutive patients with thymomas or TCs<ORGANIZATION> in the Chinese<GPE> population, emphasizing clinicopathologic characteristics, immunophenotypes and the prognostic impact. A total of 14 tumours were described as cystic or solid-cystic masses, and the other 4 tumours were described as solid masses. Histologically<PERSON>, 2 atypical type A, 2 type AB, 1 type B1, 8 type B2, 1 type B3, 1 microscopic thymoma ( type A ), 2 squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs<ORGANIZATION> ) and 1 lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma ( LELC<ORGANIZATION> ) were classified. Prominent multilocular cystic areas with chronic inflammation were observed. The follow-up ranged from 2 to 79 months. Sixteen patients survived without any evidence of recurrence after complete resection. Our study suggests that thymomas or TCs<ORGANIZATION> associated with MTCs<ORGANIZATION> are rare in the Chinese<GPE> population and have a better clinical behaviour than thymomas or TCs<ORGANIZATION> without MTCs<ORGANIZATION>. Our data also expand the histologic spectrum of thymomas or TCs<ORGANIZATION> accompanied by MTC<ORGANIZATION>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of atypical type A thymoma and LELC<ORGANIZATION> associated with MTCs<ORGANIZATION>.
