 Skeletal<GPE> muscle index ( SMI<ORGANIZATION> ) and the controlling nutritional status ( CONUT<ORGANIZATION> ) score are useful for evaluating nutritional status, which is closely associated with cancer prognosis. This study compared the prognostic value of these indicators in patients with gastric cancer ( GC ) after radical gastrectomy ( RG ). We retrospectively enrolled 532 patients between 2010 and 2011. SMI<ORGANIZATION> was measured via CT<ORGANIZATION> images to determine low SMI<ORGANIZATION>. The CONUT<ORGANIZATION> score was calculated based on serum albumin, total lymphocyte count, and cholesterol. Patients were grouped according to SMI<ORGANIZATION> and the CONUT<ORGANIZATION> score based on previous research. Spearman<PERSON> 's correlation coefficient, the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox<PERSON> regression were used. There was no significant correlation between SMI<ORGANIZATION> and the CONUT<ORGANIZATION> score. Five-year overall survival ( OS ) and recurrence-free survival ( RFS<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with low SMI<ORGANIZATION> were significantly worse than those in patients with high SMI<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < .001 ). The normal nutrition group had better OS and RFS<ORGANIZATION> than did the light and moderate or severe malnutrition groups ( P<PERSON> < .05 ), but the OS<ORGANIZATION> and RFS<ORGANIZATION> were not significantly different between the light and moderate or severe malnutrition groups ( P<PERSON> = .726 ). Univariate<ORGANIZATION> analysis showed that SMI<ORGANIZATION> and the CONUT<ORGANIZATION> score were associated with OS<ORGANIZATION> and RFS<ORGANIZATION>, but only SMI<ORGANIZATION> remained prognostic in multivariate analysis. Preoperative SMI based on CT images is a more objective predictor than the CONUT<ORGANIZATION> score of long-term survival in GC after RG<ORGANIZATION>, but this finding must be confirmed by prospective trials.
