 Laminar<GPE> heterotopia is a rare condition consisting in an extra layer of gray matter under properly migrated cortex ; it configures an atypical presentation of periventricular nodular heterotopia ( PNH<ORGANIZATION> ) or a double cortex ( DC ) syndrome. We conducted an original functional MRI<ORGANIZATION> ( fMRI<ORGANIZATION> ) analysis in a drug-resistant epilepsy patient with `` double-cortex '' -like malformation to reveal her functional connectivity ( FC ) as well as a wide genetic analysis to identify possible genetic substrates. Heterotopias<PERSON> were segmented into region of interests ( ROIs<ORGANIZATION> ), whose voxel-wise FC was compared to that of ( i ) its normally migrated counterpart, ( ii ) its contralateral homologous, and ( iii ) those of 30 age-matched healthy controls. Extensive genetic analysis was conducted to screen cortical malformations-associated genes. Compared to healthy controls, both laminar heterotopias and the overlying cortex showed significant reduction of FC<ORGANIZATION> with the contralateral hemisphere. Two heterozygous variants of uncertain clinical significance were found, involving autosomal recessive disease-causing genes, FAT4<ORGANIZATION> and COL18A1<ORGANIZATION>. This first FC analysis of a unique case of `` double-cortex '' -like malformation revealed a hemispheric connectivity segregation both in the laminar cortex as in the correctly migrated one, with a new pattern of genes ' mutations. Our study suggests the altered FC could have an electrophysiological and functional impact on large-scale brain networks, and the involvement of not yet identified genes in `` double-cortex '' -like malformation with a possible role of rare variants in recessive genes as pathogenic cofactors.
