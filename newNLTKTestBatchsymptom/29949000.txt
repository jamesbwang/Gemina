 The pathophysiological mechanisms of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome<ORGANIZATION> ( PRES ) and related seizures remain poorly understood. The prevalence and clinical significance of nonconvulsive seizures ( NCSz<ORGANIZATION> ) and related epileptiform patterns during continuous electroencephalography monitoring ( CEEG<ORGANIZATION> ) in PRES have not been well described. To report the prevalence, characteristics and risk factors for NCSz<ORGANIZATION> and related highly epileptiform patterns in patients with PRES<ORGANIZATION>, and to determine their relation to imaging abnormalities and outcome. From a prospective CEEG<ORGANIZATION> database, we retrospectively identified patients with PRES<ORGANIZATION> and reviewed their medical charts. Based on CEEG<ORGANIZATION> findings, we designed a retrospective cohort study comparing two groups defined based on the presence or the absence of NCSz<ORGANIZATION> and/or periodic discharges ( PDs<ORGANIZATION> ). The prevalence and risk factors for PDs<ORGANIZATION> and NCSz<ORGANIZATION>, description of EEG<ORGANIZATION> and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) abnormalities and functional outcome as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale<ORGANIZATION> ( GOS<ORGANIZATION> ) at hospital discharge. Among 37 eligible patients, 23 ( 62 % ) had PDs<ORGANIZATION> or NCSz<ORGANIZATION>. The presence of NCSz<ORGANIZATION> was associated with the presence of PDs<ORGANIZATION> ( 15/22 vs. 1/15 ; p = 0.0002 ). NCSz<ORGANIZATION> and PDs<ORGANIZATION> were usually either lateralized or bilateral independent and predominated in the posterior regions. No clinical features were associated with the occurrence of PDs<ORGANIZATION> or NCSz<ORGANIZATION>. Cortical<PERSON> restricted diffusion on MRI<ORGANIZATION> was more frequent in the PDs/NCSz group ( 17/23 vs. 1/14 ; p < 0.001 ). PDs/NCSz were associated with worse outcome, with 3 deaths vs. 0 in the no PDs/NCSz group and fewer cases with low disability ( 4 vs. 9 cases with GOS<ORGANIZATION> = 5, p < 0.04 ). Our results reveal a high prevalence of NCSz<ORGANIZATION> and PDs<ORGANIZATION> in critically ill patients with PRES<ORGANIZATION> and an association with restricted diffusion and worse outcome, whether treating or preventing these EEG findings can improve outcome requires further research.
