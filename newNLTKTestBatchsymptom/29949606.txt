 The aim of this study was to determine and to verify the correlation between the amount of prolactin ( PRL<ORGANIZATION> ) levels in the blood and in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF<ORGANIZATION> ) by various causes of death as an indicator for acute hypoxia in autopsy cases. It is to confirm the cause of the change in prolactin level in CSF by in vitro system. In autopsy materials, the PRL<ORGANIZATION> levels in blood from the right heart ventricle and in the CSF<ORGANIZATION> were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay, and changes in the percentage of PRL-positive cells in the pituitary gland were examined using an immunohistochemical method. Furthermore, an inverted culture method was used as an in vitro model of the blood-CSF barrier using epithelial cells of the human choroid plexus ( HIBCPP<ORGANIZATION> cell line ) and SDR-P-1D5 or MSH-P3 ( PRL-secreting cell line derived from miniature swine hypophysis ) under normoxic or hypoxic ( 5 % oxygen ) conditions, and as an index of cell activity, we used Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor<PERSON> ( VEGF<ORGANIZATION> ). Serum PRL<PERSON> levels were not significantly different between hypoxia/ischemia cases and other causes of death. However, PRL<ORGANIZATION> levels in CSF<ORGANIZATION> were three times higher in cases of hypoxia/ischemia than in those of the other causes of death. In the cultured cell under the hypoxia condition, PRL<ORGANIZATION> and VEGF<ORGANIZATION> showed a high concentration at 10 min. We established a brain-CSF barrier model to clarify the mechanism of PRL<ORGANIZATION> transport to CSF<ORGANIZATION> from blood, the PRL<ORGANIZATION> concentrations from blood to CSF<ORGANIZATION> increased under hypoxic conditions from 5 min. These results suggested that PRL<ORGANIZATION> moves in CSF<ORGANIZATION> through choroidal epithelium from blood within a short time. PRL<ORGANIZATION> is hypothesized to protect the hypoxic/ischemic brain, and this may be because of the increased transportation of the choroid plexus epithelial cells.
