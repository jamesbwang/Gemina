 To evaluate the efficacy, sensitivity and specificity of chest x-ray as a diagnostic imaging tool in management of thorax traumas. Descriptive study. Haydarpasa Numune Training<PERSON> and Research Hospital<PERSON>, Istanbul<GPE>, Turkey<GPE>, between December 2014 and December 2015. Case records of patients admitted to the emergency department with thoracic trauma were retrospectively analysed through the hospital database. Plain postero-anterior chest X-rays and thorax computerised tomography ( CT ) scans were evaluated seperately by same radiologist. Accurcy of signs of thoracic trama was determined using CT<ORGANIZATION> scan as gold standard. Nine of 23 pneumothorax patients were diagnosed by chest X-ray. Sensitivity and specificity of PA chest X-ray in the diagnosis of pneumothorax was 39.1 % and 100 %, respectively. Positive predictive values of chest X-ray for diagnosis of pneumothorax was 100 % and negative predictive value was 97.1 %. Twenty-four patients had pleural effusions on CT scans, while only 15 could be diagnosed in chest X-rays. Chest X-rays were 62.5 % sensitive and 100 % specific with positive and negative predictive values of 100 % and 98.1 %, respectively. Twenty of 41 rib fractures were diagnosed with X-rays. Chest<PERSON> x rays had a 48.8 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 100 % and 95.6 %, respectively. Chest X-ray should not be used as a sole diagnostic imaging tool for exclusion of pneumothorax, hemothorax, and lung contusion. Due<PERSON> to high predictive values of chest X-rays, they can be used for follow-up.
