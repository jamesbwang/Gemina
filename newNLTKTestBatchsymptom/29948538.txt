 Little<GPE> information about the development of skin lesions in relation to arsenic exposure duration is available. Therefore, skin lesions in a cohort from the Bameng<GPE> region of China<GPE> were diagnosed in 2012 and 2017. The results indicated that the prevalence of hyperkeratosis, pigmentation and depigmentation in 2017 was 64.67, 6.67 and 12.67 %. There were 42 and 34 % of male subjects and female subjects suffered from skin lesions in 2012. Their morbidity rates were 10.43 and 8.98 per 1000 person-years. In 2017, the values were significantly increased. The prevalence and morbidity rate of skin lesions were positively correlated with age and arsenic levels in drinking water. Males<PERSON> had higher prevalence of skin lesions compared with female. However, the â‰¤ 40 years female group had higher prevalence of skin lesions. In addition, the increased rate of skin lesions prevalence was negatively correlated with arsenic levels in drinking water. The odds ratios ( ORs<ORGANIZATION> ) showed that the risks of skin lesions were positively associated with the proportion of inorganic arsenic ( % iAs ) and monomethylarsonic acid ( % MMA ) in urine, and negatively correlated with arsenic methylation capacity in both 2012 and 2017. It can be concluded that females immigrated from other areas were more susceptible to developing skin lesions. A certain cumulative arsenic exposure dose, which may be existing, significantly increased the prevalence of skin lesions. Longer<PERSON> arsenic exposure duration might elevate the toxicity of iAs<ORGANIZATION> to skin lesions and reduce the positive effects of arsenic methylation capacity on skin lesions.
