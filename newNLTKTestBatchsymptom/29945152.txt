 Li-Fraumeni syndrome ( LFS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a rare highly penetrant cancer syndrome characterized by mutation in the TP53<ORGANIZATION> tumor suppressor gene. Recent data suggest that this germline mutation is more frequent than once thought. While LFS<ORGANIZATION> has not been associated previously with pelvic serous carcinoma, gynecologic malignancies have been reported in this patient population. We present the case report of a 37-year-old patient with known LFS<ORGANIZATION> and a history of multiple cancers who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy for benign indications with incidental bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. On final pathology, she was found to have serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma of bilateral fallopian tubes. Our findings raise the question of the potential role of prophylactic gynecologic cancer-reducing surgery in this patient population.
