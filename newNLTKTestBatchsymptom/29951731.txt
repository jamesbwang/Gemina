 Neuronal<GPE> apoptosis is a potentially fatal pathological process that occurs in early brain injury ( EBI<ORGANIZATION> ) after subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH<ORGANIZATION> ). There is an urgent need to identify effective therapeutics to alleviate neuronal apoptosis. Tetramethylpyrazine ( TMP<ORGANIZATION> ), as an important component of the Chinese<GPE> traditional medicinal herb Ligusticum wallichii, has been widely used in China<GPE> to treat cerebral ischemic injury and confer neuroprotection. In the present work, we investigate whether TMP<ORGANIZATION> can reduce EBI<ORGANIZATION> following SAH<ORGANIZATION> in rats, specifically via inactivating the PERK/Akt signaling cascade. One hundred twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the present study. TMP<ORGANIZATION> was administered by intravenous ( i.v. ) injection, and the Akt<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor MK2206<ORGANIZATION> was injected intracerebroventricularly ( i.c.v. ). SAH grade, neurological scores, and brain water content were measured 24 h after SAH<ORGANIZATION>. Neuronal apoptosis was visualized by Fluoro-Jade C ( FJC<ORGANIZATION> ) staining. Western blotting was used to measure the levels of PERK<ORGANIZATION>, p-PERK, eIF2α<ORGANIZATION>, p-eIF2α, Akt<PERSON>, p-Akt, Bcl-2, Bax<PERSON>, and cleaved caspase-3. Our results showed that TMP<ORGANIZATION> effectively reduced neuronal apoptosis and improved neurobehavioral deficits 24 h after SAH<ORGANIZATION>. Administration<ORGANIZATION> of TMP<ORGANIZATION> reduced the abundance of p-PERK and p-eIF2α. In addition, TMP<ORGANIZATION> increased the p-Akt level and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decreased the level of cleaved caspase-3. The selective Akt inhibitor MK2206<ORGANIZATION> abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of TMP<ORGANIZATION> at 24 h after SAH<ORGANIZATION>. Collectively, these results indicate that Akt-related anti-apoptosis through the PERK<ORGANIZATION> pathway is a major, potent mechanism of EBI<ORGANIZATION>. Further<PERSON> investigation of this pathway may provide a basis for the development of TMP<ORGANIZATION> as a clinical treatment.
