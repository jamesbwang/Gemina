 Iron-based nanoparticles ( FeNPs<ORGANIZATION> ) have unique and attractive properties such as superparamagnetism, biocompatibility and catalytic activity. Although the synthesis of precious metal NPs from a metal in liquid and/or metal salt solution by a pulsed laser has been well reported, little has been examined about the production of FeNPs<ORGANIZATION>. Here we report the synthesis of spherical NPs<ORGANIZATION> of iron oxide ( magnetite ) without wearing carbon shells from ferrocene hexane solution by femtosecond NIR<ORGANIZATION> laser pulses. Nanosecond UV<PERSON> laser is also used to compare the time evolutions of the particle size distribution. The size of NPs<ORGANIZATION> remains constant even by the long-term femtosecond laser irradiation, whereas it grows with nanosecond laser pulses. The primary particles are generated by photochemical reactions regardless of pulse durations ; however, the fragmentation of NPs<ORGANIZATION> by the successive femtosecond laser pulses regulates the particle size.
