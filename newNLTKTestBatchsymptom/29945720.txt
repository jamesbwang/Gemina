 Formulation of a global Unified Dosimetry Index<ORGANIZATION> ( gUDI<ORGANIZATION> ) for the evaluation of prostate simultaneous integrated boost Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy<PERSON> ( VMAT<ORGANIZATION> by RapidArc<ORGANIZATION> ) radiotherapy plans. Dose coverage, conformity, homogeneity and dose gradient index could be included in the Unified Dosimetry Index<ORGANIZATION> ( UDI<ORGANIZATION> ). We developed a global UDI to evaluate treatment plans containing volumes irradiated with different dose prescriptions: Intensity<ORGANIZATION> Modulated Radiation Therapy with simultaneous integrated boost ( IMRT-SIB ) with 2 dose levels ( 36.25 Gy/5 fz for the whole prostate gland and 37.5 Gy/5 fz for Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion<ORGANIZATION> ( DIL<ORGANIZATION> ) ). To validate gUDI<ORGANIZATION> scoring system, 65 prostate cancer patients were evaluated. Mean<GPE> ( µ ) and standard deviations ( σ ) were calculated for all dosimetry indices and gUDI<ORGANIZATION>. Furthermore, gUDI<ORGANIZATION> µ and σ were analyzed to compare and classify treatment plans: plans can be ranked as `` excellent '', `` good '', `` average '' or `` poor ''. Prostate Dose Gradient, Prostate Conformity<ORGANIZATION> and DIL Conformity<ORGANIZATION> indices had highlighted a major deviation from ideal scores. gUDI index classification showed most of the plans scored as `` average '' and `` good ''. gUDI score can be a useful tool to quantify treatment plans quality also when volumes with different dose-prescription are treated.
