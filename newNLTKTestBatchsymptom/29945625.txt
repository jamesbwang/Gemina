 Supplementation of combined glutathione ( GSH<ORGANIZATION> ) with L-citrulline in response to a single bout of resistance exercise has been shown to increase plasma nitric oxide metabolites, nitrite and nitrate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP<ORGANIZATION> ), which may play a role in muscle protein synthesis. As a result, in response to resistance training ( RT ) these responses may establish a role for GSH<ORGANIZATION> + L-citrulline to increase muscle mass. This study attempted to determine the effects of an 8-week RT program in conjunction with GSH<ORGANIZATION> ( SetriaÂ® ) + L-citrulline, L-citrulline-malate, or placebo supplementation on lean mass and its association with muscle strength. The secondary purpose was to assess the safety of such supplementation protocol by assessing clinical chemistry markers. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 75 resistance-trained males were randomly assigned to ingest GSH<ORGANIZATION> + L-citrulline ( GSH<ORGANIZATION> + CIT ), L-citrulline-malate, or cellulose placebo daily while also participating in 8 weeks of RT<ORGANIZATION>. The full dose of each supplement was delivered in capsules that were identical in weight, size, shape, and color. Participants<PERSON> completed testing sessions for body composition and muscle strength before and after 4 and 8 weeks of RT<ORGANIZATION> and supplementation. Venous<PERSON> blood samples were obtained before and after 8 weeks. Leg<PERSON> press was increased with RT but was not significantly different between groups ( p > 0.05 ) ; however, bench press strength was not increased with RT<ORGANIZATION> ( p > 0.05 ). There were no significant changes in total body mass, fat mass, or total body water during 8 weeks of RT<ORGANIZATION> and supplementation. Lean mass increased in both GSH<ORGANIZATION> + CIT when compared to PLC<ORGANIZATION> ; however, the increase was significant only after 4 weeks. Lean mass and strength were positively correlated ( p < 0.05 ) in GSH<ORGANIZATION> + CIT, but not CIT-malate or PLC<ORGANIZATION>. Neither RT nor supplementation had any significant effects on blood clinical chemistry variables ( p > 0.05 ). Compared to PLC<ORGANIZATION>, supplementation of GSH<ORGANIZATION> + CIT during resistance training increased lean mass after 4 weeks of RT<ORGANIZATION> and was positively associated with muscle strength. However, after 8 weeks of RT there were no significant differences in any of the measured variables.
