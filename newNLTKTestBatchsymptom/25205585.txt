 Consensus<GSP> on the definition of airflow obstruction to diagnose COPD<ORGANIZATION> remains unresolved. We undertook systematic case finding for COPD<ORGANIZATION> in primary care using the fixed ratio ( FR ) criterion ( forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity [ FEV A total of 3,721 individuals reporting respiratory symptoms were invited for spirometry. A total of 2,607 attended ( mean age 60.4 years, 52.8 % male, 29.8 % current smokers ) and 32.6 % had airflow obstruction by FR<ORGANIZATION> ( `` FR+ '' ) and 20.2 % by LLN<ORGANIZATION> ( `` LLN+ '' ). Compared with the LLN+/FR+ group, the LLN-/FR+ group ( 12.4 % ) was significantly older, had higher FEV In symptomatic individuals, defining airflow obstruction by FR<ORGANIZATION> instead of LLN<ORGANIZATION> identifies a significant number of individuals who have less respiratory and more cardiac clinical characteristics.
