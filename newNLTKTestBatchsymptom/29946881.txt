 Notable differences have been identified between low-resolution manometry ( LRM<ORGANIZATION> ) and high-resolution manometry ( HRM<ORGANIZATION> ) in normative data. This study aimed to investigate within-subject differences between unidirectional LRM<ORGANIZATION> and circumferential HRM<ORGANIZATION> solid-state measurement sensors in the pharyngoesophageal segment during swallowing. Ten healthy subjects ( mean 26.9 years ) were evaluated with both a 2.10 mm unidirectional catheter and a 2.75 mm circumferential catheter, with randomized order of catheter placement. Unidirectional measurements were made in four directions ( posterior, anterior, right-lateral, left-lateral ). Pressures and durations were analyzed to compare ( 1 ) posterior to anterior and lateral recordings and ( 2 ) posterior and average-LRM measures ( C-LRM ) to HRM<ORGANIZATION> measures at same anatomical location. No significant differences were found in any of the measures across the four radial directions. A lower amplitude was measured in C-LRM compared to HRM<ORGANIZATION> for pharyngeal sensors ( LRM<ORGANIZATION> Sensor 1: - 39.7 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> ; Sensor 2: - 61.4 mmHg ). Compared with posterior-LRM, HRM<ORGANIZATION> recorded higher UES<ORGANIZATION> pressures ( - 12.8 mmHg ) and longer UES<ORGANIZATION> relaxation durations ( - 0.31 s ). This exploratory study is the first to compare within-subject pressures between unidirectional LRM<ORGANIZATION> and circumferential HRM<ORGANIZATION>. Substantial differences in pharyngeal manometric measures were found, particularly with regard to UES<ORGANIZATION> function. This is clinically important as manometry is uniquely able to evaluate UES<ORGANIZATION> function and clarify differential diagnoses in patients with dysphagia.
