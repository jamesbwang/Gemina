 Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 ( MDA5<ORGANIZATION> ) dermatomyositis ( DM ) is a distinctive subtype of DM that carries a significant risk of interstitial lung disease ( ILD<ORGANIZATION> ). The mechanisms remain elusive. To explore the role of type I interferon ( IFN<ORGANIZATION> ) system in the pathogenesis of anti-MDA5 DM. Twenty<PERSON> anti-MDA5 DM patients were studied and compared with anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ( ARS<ORGANIZATION> ) DM patients ( n=10 ) and autoAb<ORGANIZATION> negative DM patients ( n=20 ). The levels of inflammatory cytokines, B cell activating factor ( BAFF<ORGANIZATION> ), and Krebs<PERSON> von den Lungen-6 ( KL-6 ) in blood were tested by ELISA<ORGANIZATION> and multiplex assays. Expressions of transcripts for IFN-associated sensors and type I IFN<ORGANIZATION> inducible genes in PBMCs<ORGANIZATION> were detected by real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION> analysis. Expressions of STAT1<ORGANIZATION>, ISG15<ORGANIZATION>, and MxA<ORGANIZATION> proteins in skin lesions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry technique. Plasma<PERSON> IFN-α levels were found to dominantly increase in anti-MDA5 DM patients. PBMCs from anti-MDA5 DM patients were shown to have the significant upregulations of TLR3<ORGANIZATION>, TLR7<ORGANIZATION>, MDA5<ORGANIZATION>, RIG-I genes as well as serial IFN-inducible genes. Skin biopsies from anti-MDA5 DM patients were characterized by the strong expressions of STAT1<ORGANIZATION>, ISG15<ORGANIZATION>, and MxA<ORGANIZATION> proteins. In the anti-MDA5 DM/ILD patients with high IFN-α production, there was a positive quantitative correlation between IFN-α and BAFF<ORGANIZATION> ( r Our data confirm the aberrant activation of type I IFN<ORGANIZATION> system in anti-MDA5 DM. Overproduction of IFN-α linked with BAFF<ORGANIZATION> may be implicated in the development of ILD<ORGANIZATION>. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
