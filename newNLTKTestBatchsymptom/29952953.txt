 To evaluate the anticoagulation efficacy of dabigatran etexilate for left atrial appendage ( LAA<ORGANIZATION> ) thrombus resolution in patients with atrial fibrillation by transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography, and to investigate the anticoagulation factors.A total of 58 atrial fibrillation patients with LAA<ORGANIZATION> thrombus in our hospital were enrolled. After dabigatran etexilate anticoagulation for 3 months, the patients were divided into the effective group and ineffective group according to dissolution of thrombosis. The baseline data and the left atrial diameter ( LAD<ORGANIZATION> ), left atrial ejection fraction ( LAEF<ORGANIZATION> ), left ventricular ejection fraction, LAA<ORGANIZATION> flow velocity ( LAA-v ), and LAA<ORGANIZATION> thrombus size before and after anticoagulation treatment were recorded, and the measurement index were statistically analyzed.After the patients received anticoagulation treatment for 3 months, 15 patients had complete dissolution, thrombus in 21 patients reduced significantly, and the complete dissolution rate was 25.9 % ( 15/58 ), the effective rate of dissolution was 62.1 % ( 36/58 ). Compared with the ineffective group, the proportion of persistent atrial fibrillation and LAD<ORGANIZATION> in effective group were lower than those in the ineffective group, the LAEF<ORGANIZATION> and LAA-v in the effective group were higher than those in the ineffective group, and the differences were statistically significant ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). Multivariate logistic regression analysis on the baseline data and each ultrasound index showed that the type of atrial fibrillation, LAD<ORGANIZATION>, LAEF<ORGANIZATION>, and LAA-v were independently associated with the efficacy of anticoagulation ( P<PERSON> < .05 ) .Dabigatran etexilate is effective in dissolution of LAA<ORGANIZATION> thrombus in patients with atrial fibrillation, and the atrial fibrillation type, LAD<ORGANIZATION>, LAEF<ORGANIZATION>, and LAA-v are significantly related with the efficacy of anticoagulation.
