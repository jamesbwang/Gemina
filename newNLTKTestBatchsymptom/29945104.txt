 Cigarette<GPE> smoking is a significant risk factor for higher incidences of numerous adverse health consequences. Related health disorders are also found in non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke ( SHS<ORGANIZATION> ). To investigate the influence of cigarette smoking and exposure to SHS<ORGANIZATION> on the composition of human skin gas, a trace biogas emanating from human skin, dermal emissions of volatile compounds were semi-quantitatively measured for volunteers who smoke a cigarette and those exposed to SHS<ORGANIZATION>. This was performed using a passive flux sampler ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry ( GCMS<ORGANIZATION> ). Numerous chemicals were detected, including acetaldehyde, toluene, 3-methyl furan ( 3-MF ), 2,5-dimethyl furan ( 2,5-DMF ), 3-ethenyl pyridine ( 3-EP ), and nicotine, in the samples collected from the smokers after a smoking event, and a remarkable increase in the amount of chemicals collected was observed just after smoking. These chemicals were also found in the samples collected from volunteers exposed to SHS<ORGANIZATION>. Assessment of current smoking status is important for managing the negative effects of active and passive smoking, and for the development of public health policy. The tobacco specific chemicals such as 3-MF, 2,5-DMF, 3-EP, and nicotine, emanating from human skin surfaces, represent a potential non-invasive biomarker for monitoring current smoking status of active and passive smokers after establishing a more quantitative procedure.
