 Food<GPE> insecurity, internalized HIV<ORGANIZATION> stigma, and depressive symptoms are independently associated with poor HIV outcomes. Food<PERSON> insecurity, stigma, and depression may be interrelated among women living with HIV<ORGANIZATION> ( WLHIV<ORGANIZATION> ). We hypothesized that food insecurity would be independently associated with internalized stigma and depressive symptoms among WLHIV<ORGANIZATION> in the United States<GPE> ( US<ORGANIZATION> ), and would partially account for associations between stigma and depressive symptoms. We tested hypotheses using regression models and partial correlation analysis with cross-sectional data among 1317 WLHIV from the Women<GPE> 's Interagency<ORGANIZATION> HIV Study. In adjusted models, greater food insecurity was associated with internalized HIV stigma and depressive symptoms ( all p < 0.05 ), exhibiting dose-response relationships. Food<PERSON> insecurity accounted for 23.2 % of the total shared variance between depressive symptoms and internalized stigma. Food<PERSON> insecurity is associated with depressive symptoms and internalized HIV stigma among US<ORGANIZATION> WLHIV, and may play a role in the negative cycle of depression and internalized stigma.
