 Adjusting the dietary cation-anion difference ( DCAD<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the most efficient ways to stimulate calcium homeostasis in periparturient dairy cattle. However, adjusting DCAD<ORGANIZATION> to the recommended negative values ( -100 to -150 mEq/kg ) is associated with decreased food intake and metabolic acidosis. The critical conditions of the animals at peripartum ( i.e. drastic hormonal changes, decreased appetite and negative energy balance ) can be detrimental to the health, productivity and welfare of the animals if combined with decreased feed intake caused by unpalatable acidogenic salts. In a cross-sectional study, we analysed the ration of eight small to large dairy herds with intensive husbandry systems, including 6949 dry cows. Sodium<PERSON>, potassium, chlorine and sulfur concentrations in the feed were determined and DCAD<ORGANIZATION> was calculated. The DCAD<ORGANIZATION> of the ration of the farms ranged from -33.5 to +24.7 mEq/kg. Parturient<ORGANIZATION> paresis ( PP<ORGANIZATION>, or milk fever ) prevalence was investigated and correlated to DCAD<ORGANIZATION> values. Clinical PP<PERSON> occurrence in the dairies of this investigation on average declined by 87 % ( ranging from a 97 % decline to 5 % increase ). This indicates that adjusting DCAD<ORGANIZATION> at neutral values ( 0 Â± 30 mEq/kg range ) may both lower the PP<ORGANIZATION> prevalence and increase ration palatability by lowering acidogenic salts in the ration. Further<PERSON> research is recommended to investigate the effects of neutral DCAD<ORGANIZATION> on subclinical hypocalcaemia and food intake of the cattle.
