 Intervertebral disk ( IVD<ORGANIZATION> ) lesion and its subsequent degeneration have a profound effect on the multifidus muscle. The subacute/early chronic phase of multifidus remodeling after IVD<ORGANIZATION> lesion has been proposed to be regulated by inflammatory processes. The balance between pro-inflammatory ( M1 ) and anti-inflammatory ( M2 ) macrophages plays an important role in maintaining tissue integrity after injury. The localization, polarization of macrophage subtypes and their mediation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF<ORGANIZATION> ) are unknown in paraspinal muscles during IVD<ORGANIZATION> degeneration. A sheep model of IVD<ORGANIZATION> degeneration was used to investigate the role of macrophages and TNF<ORGANIZATION> in the structural alterations that occur within the multifidus muscle. Anterolateral lesions were induced at L3-4<ORGANIZATION> IVD in sheep. Multifidus<PERSON> muscle tissue at L4<ORGANIZATION> was harvested 3 and 6 months after lesion and used for immunofluorescence assays to examine total macrophage number, macrophage polarization between M1 and M2<GPE>, and to assess the localization of TNF<ORGANIZATION> expression in muscle, adipose and connective tissues from injured and na√Øve control animals. A greater proportion of M1<GPE> macrophages is present in muscle at both 3 and 6 months after IVD<ORGANIZATION> lesion, and adipose tissue at 6 months. Total number of macrophages is unchanged. At 6 months, expression of TNF<ORGANIZATION> is increased in adipose and connective tissue and the proportion of TNF<ORGANIZATION> expressed by M1 macrophages is increased. These data support the proposal that macrophages and TNF<ORGANIZATION> ( pro-inflammatory cytokine ) play an active role in the subacute/early chronic phase of remodeling in muscle, adipose and connective tissues of the multifidus during IVD<ORGANIZATION> degeneration. This presents a novel target for treatment. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material<PERSON>.
