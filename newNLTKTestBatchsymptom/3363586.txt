 Premature ventricular complex ( PVCs<ORGANIZATION> ) detected from long-term ECG<ORGANIZATION> recordings have been associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, there was limited data about the association between high PVCs<ORGANIZATION> burdens ( > 10 % ) and stroke-like symptoms without a prior diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack in the long-term follow up. The Kosin University<ORGANIZATION> 24-hours holter monitoring, echocardiography, electrocardiogram ( ECG<ORGANIZATION> ) database were reviewed from 2013 to 2015 to identify patients with frequent PVCs<ORGANIZATION> ( > 10 % ). We compared the long-term clinical outcomes between the patients with frequent PVCs<ORGANIZATION> ( > 10 % ) and control group without PVC<ORGANIZATION>. Among 572 patients who underwent 24-hours holter monitoring, finally, 373 consecutive patients ( mean age ; 59.5 Â± 15.8 years, 45.2 % male ) were enrolled. Among them, 203 ( 54.4 % ) patients had high PVCs<ORGANIZATION> burdens ( > 10 % ). There was no difference of the baseline characteristics. In the long term follow-up, PVCs<ORGANIZATION> burden was not associated with PVCs<ORGANIZATION> -related symptoms ( High<ORGANIZATION> PVCs burdens ( > 10 % ) were associated with and stroke-like symptoms without a prior diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack in the long-term follow up, suggesting more intensive medical therapy with close clinical follow-up will be required.
