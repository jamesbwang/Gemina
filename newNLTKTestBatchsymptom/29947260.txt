 Background<GPE> Since the Food<ORGANIZATION> and Drug Administration<PERSON> approval of balloon sinuplasty ( BSP<ORGANIZATION> ) in 2005, no nationally representative population-based studies have examined the outcomes and adverse events of BSP<ORGANIZATION>. Objective To assess the rates of complications and revision surgery in patients who received BSP<ORGANIZATION>, functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS<ORGANIZATION> ), or a hybrid procedure. Methods Using one of the nation 's largest commercial insurance databases, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis between 2011 and 2014 who underwent BSP<ORGANIZATION>, conventional FESS<ORGANIZATION>, or a hybrid procedure. The primary outcomes were surgical complication and revision rates within 6 months of initial surgery. Results A total of 16,040 patients who underwent sinus surgery were included. Overall, 2,851 patients underwent BSP<ORGANIZATION>, 11,955 underwent conventional FESS<ORGANIZATION>, and 1 234 underwent a hybrid procedure. BSP<ORGANIZATION> surgery was more likely to have been performed in an office setting ( 86.53 % ) compared to FESS<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.74 % ). The complication rate was 5.26 % for BSP<ORGANIZATION> and 7.35 % for conventional FESS<ORGANIZATION>. Revision rates were 7.89 % for BSP<ORGANIZATION>, 16.85 % for FESS<ORGANIZATION>, and 15.15 % for a hybrid procedure. Conclusion Despite the low overall risk, major complications occur with BSP<ORGANIZATION> including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pneumocephalus, orbital complications, and severe bleeding. Otolaryngologists should discuss these risks with their patients. Prospective studies are still needed to compare outcomes of BSP<ORGANIZATION> with those of FESS<ORGANIZATION>.
