 Tobacco<GPE> hornworm ( Manduca<ORGANIZATION> sexta, THW<ORGANIZATION> ) is a voracious pest of tomato and potato. StZFP2<ORGANIZATION> is a Q-type C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor ( TF ) that is induced upon wounding and infestation. Previous work has shown that Q-type C2H2 TFs are involved in stress responses and when over expressed, can enhance protection against drought, salinity or pathogen infection. Twelve<PERSON> transgenic lines ( S1-S12 ) were tested that over-express StZFP2<ORGANIZATION>. Feeding S6 or S8 to THW<ORGANIZATION> significantly lowered larval weight ( 21-37 % ) as well as increased expression of StPIN2<ORGANIZATION> in comparison to untransformed Kennebec. The increase in StPIN2<GPE>, a classic marker for insect defense in potato, is consistent with the decreases in larval weight gain.
