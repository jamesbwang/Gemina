 Adverse<GPE> food reactions ( AFR<ORGANIZATION> ) are a common cause of skin diseases in cats and dogs. The correct diagnosis and management of AFR<ORGANIZATION> relies upon clinical nutrition. The reliability of commercial hypoallergenic diets commonly used in AFR<ORGANIZATION> has been questioned because studies have shown the presence of proteins not declared on the label ingredients. It is proposed that extensively hydrolysed protein-based diets constitute a reliable nutritional solution. Royal Canin Anallergenic<PERSON> & trade ; Canine<GPE> and Feline<GPE> diets are formulated with very low molecular weight feather protein and purified corn starch. Protein<PERSON> gel electrophoresis and thin layer paper chromatography were used to characterize protein hydrolysis in these diets and their hydrolysed raw materials ; protein species were identified by mass spectrometry. To detect cross-contaminating protein, species-specific DNA<ORGANIZATION> was measured and correlated with ancillary protein content using calibration curves. The only protein components detected in the extensively hydrolysed feather protein raw material were amino acids and small oligopeptides. GBSS-I ( Granule-bound starch synthase 1 ) was detected in the finished diets ; this has not been reported as a clinically apparent allergen in dogs or cats. The DNA<ORGANIZATION> threshold corresponding to the maximum acceptable level of ancillary protein was not exceeded in 99.9 % of more than 2150 product batches tested and no products were released to the market with cross-contaminating proteins. These results demonstrate the extensive level of protein hydrolysis in Royal<GPE> Canin Anallergenic & trade ; Canine<GPE> and Feline<GPE> diets and the absence of cross-contaminating protein, both key requirements for a diet to be used during diagnosis and for management of pets with AFR<ORGANIZATION>.
