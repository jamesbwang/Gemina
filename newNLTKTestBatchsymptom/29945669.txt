 Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS<ORGANIZATION> ) involves a neuromodulatory effect using electrical stimulation and has been widely used due to its safety and convenience. It has been used for treating tinnitus for decades. Acupuncture<PERSON> has also been used for tinnitus and several research studies have shown that acupuncture can improve a certain kind of tinnitus by stimulating the somatosensory system. Moreover, several studies have shown the efficacy of electroacupuncture, which is a combination of acupuncture and electrical stimulation, for tinnitus. However, the comparative effectiveness of TENS<ORGANIZATION>, manual acupuncture, and electroacupuncture for the treatment of tinnitus has not been determined previously. Herein<PERSON>, we design a randomized, non-blind clinical trial to investigate and compare the effects and safety of TENS<ORGANIZATION>, manual acupuncture, and electroacupuncture for tinnitus. After screening, 45 patients are randomly assigned to three groups: ( 1 ) patients in the TENS<ORGANIZATION> group are treated at four sites ( tender points of masseter and the sternocleidomastoid muscle, in front of tragus, and mastoid process ) ; ( 2 ) the manual acupuncture group patients are treated at 11 acupoints ( TE21<ORGANIZATION>, SI19<ORGANIZATION>, GB2<ORGANIZATION>, TE22<ORGANIZATION>, ST7<ORGANIZATION>, TE17<ORGANIZATION>, GB20<ORGANIZATION> of tinnitus affected side, and GB20<ORGANIZATION>, TE05<ORGANIZATION>, KI3<ORGANIZATION> of both sides ) ; ( 3 ) electroacupuncture group patients are treated by using acupuncture as in the manual acupuncture group and electrical stimulation at TE21<ORGANIZATION>, SI19<ORGANIZATION>, TE17<ORGANIZATION>, and GB20<ORGANIZATION>. Patients are treated for ten sessions, twice a week. The primary outcome measurement is the change of Tinnitus Handicap<ORGANIZATION> Inventory ( THI<ORGANIZATION> ) score between visit 1 and visit 10. The secondary outcome measurements are the response rate of THI<ORGANIZATION>, change in visual analogue scale associated with the loudness and annoyance of tinnitus, pure-tone audiometry and speech discrimination, and changes in parameters of heart rate variability. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of TENS<ORGANIZATION>, manual acupuncture, and electroacupuncture in the auricular area on tinnitus. If the specific treatment shows a significant effect compared to other treatments, it could have potential for use in clinical practice as a primary treatment.
