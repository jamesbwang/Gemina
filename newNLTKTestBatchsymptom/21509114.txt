 [ Purpose ] To explore the effects of good binocular visual acuity ( BVA<ORGANIZATION> ) compared to poor BVA<ORGANIZATION>, reach distance, task velocity, and center of mass ( COM<ORGANIZATION> ) acceleration were evaluated in elderly females performing the Y-Balance Test<GPE> ( YBT<ORGANIZATION> ) using a cross-sectional design. [ Subjects and Methods<PERSON> ] A total of 13 participants had BVA<ORGANIZATION> of ≥0.4 log of the minimum angle of resolution ( logMAR<ORGANIZATION> ) ( poor BVA<ORGANIZATION> group ), and the other 13 had BVA<ORGANIZATION> of ≤0.3 logMAR ( good BVA<ORGANIZATION> group ). An accelerometer was attached over participants ' L3 spinous process, and they then performed the YBT<ORGANIZATION>. [ Results<PERSON> ] The normalized reach distances in the three directions among the good BVA<ORGANIZATION> group were longer than those among the poor BVA<ORGANIZATION> group. The task velocity in the good BVA<ORGANIZATION> group was significantly higher, whereas COM<ORGANIZATION> acceleration in the A direction was significantly lower compared with the poor BVA<ORGANIZATION> group. [ Conclusion<ORGANIZATION> ] Visual status must be considered when older adult individuals undergo physical therapy and functional training to ensure that healthcare professionals can better assist older adult women.
