 The authors present the case of a previously healthy 12-year-old male with intractable seizures localized to a right frontal area of encephalomalacia and porencephalic cyst who underwent resection of the seizure focus. The surgical resection cavity extended into the right lateral ventricle, and due to encountered hemorrhage, Gelfoam<PERSON> was used for optimal hemostasis. The patient did well following the procedure, but presented 5 months later with headaches and emesis and was discovered to have obstructive hydrocephalus on imaging studies. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy ( ETV<ORGANIZATION> ) was performed, where Gelfoam<PERSON> was encountered in the third ventricle, obstructing the cerebral aqueduct. After the completion of the ETV<ORGANIZATION>, the patient did well and continues to be asymptomatic 1 year following the procedure.
