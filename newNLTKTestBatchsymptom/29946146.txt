 The unique biology of the oocyte means that accepted paradigms for DNA<ORGANIZATION> repair and protection are not of direct relevance to the female gamete. Instead, preservation of the integrity of the maternal genome depends on endogenous protein stores and/or mRNA<ORGANIZATION> transcripts accumulated during oogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether mature ( MII<ORGANIZATION> ) oocytes have the capacity to detect DNA<ORGANIZATION> damage and subsequently mount effective repair. For this purpose, DNA<ORGANIZATION> double strand breaks ( DSB<ORGANIZATION> ) were elicited using the topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide ( ETP<ORGANIZATION> ). ETP<ORGANIZATION> challenge led to a rapid and significant increase in DSB<GPE> ( P<PERSON> = 0.0002 ) and the consequential incidence of metaphase plate abnormalities ( P<PERSON> = 0.0031 ). Despite this, ETP-treated MII<ORGANIZATION> oocytes retained their ability to participate in in vitro fertilisation, though displayed reduced developmental competence beyond the 2-cell stage ( P<PERSON> = 0.02 ). To account for these findings, we analysed the efficacy of DSB<ORGANIZATION> resolution, revealing a significant reduction in DSB<ORGANIZATION> lesions 4 h post-ETP treatment. Notably, this response was completely abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of key elements ( DNA-PKcs and DNA<ORGANIZATION> ligase IV ) of the canonical non-homologous end joining DNA<ORGANIZATION> repair pathway, thus providing the first evidence implicating this reparative cascade in the protection of the maternal genome.
