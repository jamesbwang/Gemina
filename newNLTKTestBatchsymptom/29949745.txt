 The aim is to develop novel synergistic transparent k-Carrageenan/Xanthan gum/Gellan gum ( k-C/X/G ) hydrogel films with different weight ratio composition and to study the effect of these compositions on the physical properties of the films. The structure and morphological properties of the films were investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR ), scanning electron microscopy ( SEM<ORGANIZATION> ), X-ray diffraction ( XRD<ORGANIZATION> ) and differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC<ORGANIZATION> ). Results for FT-IR, DSC<ORGANIZATION> and SEM<ORGANIZATION> analysis showed a clear interaction between k-C, X<GPE>, and G to form a new material. The mechanical, thermal and water barrier properties such as water vapor permeability ( WVP<ORGANIZATION> ), water contact angle ( WCA<ORGANIZATION> ) and moisture content were determined. The temperature at 5 % weight loss ( T
