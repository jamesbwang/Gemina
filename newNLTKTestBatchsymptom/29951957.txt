 Electroencephalogram<GPE> ( EEG<ORGANIZATION> ) findings of generalized periodic discharges ( GPDs<ORGANIZATION> ) with triphasic morphology were introduced as a metabolic phenomenon, but more recently have been associated with epileptic phenomenon. Resolution of EEG<ORGANIZATION> findings along with clinical improvement from treatment is diagnostic. The known causes of reversible, isolated loss of OVR<ORGANIZATION> include medication toxicity, lead exposure, and thiamine deficiency, but its association with nonconvulsive status epilepticus ( NCSE<ORGANIZATION> ) has never been published. Medication<PERSON> induced loss of OVR<ORGANIZATION> resolves after a 24-hour washout period. We report a case of reversible, isolated loss of vestibular ocular reflex ( VOR<ORGANIZATION> ) associated with epileptic phenomenon. This is a case report of a single patient. A 74-year-old male with a history of complex partial seizures admitted for a pneumonectomy had a post-operative course complicated by two instances of coma, the latter associated with an isolated loss of VOR<ORGANIZATION>. EEG<ORGANIZATION> revealed GPDs<ORGANIZATION> with triphasic morphology initially interpreted as a metabolic phenomenon. The patient 's mental status, exam and EEG<ORGANIZATION> findings improved after low dose infusion of propofol for tracheostomy, and he was eventually discharged at baseline neurological function. Due to this response, his coma, loss of VOR<ORGANIZATION> and EEG<ORGANIZATION> were later interpreted as a consequence of NCSE<ORGANIZATION>. The interpretation of GPDs<ORGANIZATION> with triphasic wave morphology range from metabolic phenomenon to NCSE<ORGANIZATION>. NCSE<ORGANIZATION> should be highly considered on the differential for encephalopathy regardless of the circumstances. NCSE<ORGANIZATION> may be a potential cause of reversible, isolated loss of the VOR<ORGANIZATION> and an AED<ORGANIZATION> trial in the appropriate clinical context should be considered. This is the first report of loss of VOR<ORGANIZATION> possibly associated with NCSE<ORGANIZATION>.
