 Abaloparatide<GPE> ( ABL<ORGANIZATION> ) is a 34-amino acid peptide designed to be a selective activator of the parathyroid hormone receptor type 1 signaling pathway. In the Abaloparatide Comparator Trial<ORGANIZATION> In Vertebral Endpoints<ORGANIZATION> ( ACTIVE<ORGANIZATION> ), subcutaneous ABL<ORGANIZATION> reduced the risk of new vertebral, nonvertebral, clinical, and major osteoporotic fracture compared with placebo and of major osteoporotic fracture compared with teriparatide. To further evaluate the effectiveness of ABL<ORGANIZATION>, we calculated the number needed to treat ( NNT<ORGANIZATION> ) to prevent one fracture using ACTIVE<ORGANIZATION> data. To estimate the potential effectiveness of ABL<ORGANIZATION> in populations at higher fracture risk than in ACTIVE<GPE>, we calculated NNT<ORGANIZATION> for vertebral fracture using reference populations from historical placebo-controlled trials, assuming an 86 % relative risk reduction in vertebral fracture with ABL<ORGANIZATION> treatment as observed in ACTIVE<GPE>. NNT<ORGANIZATION> was calculated as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction in ACTIVE<GPE>. The projected NNT<ORGANIZATION> for ABL<ORGANIZATION> in other populations was calculated based on incidence rate ( IR ) for vertebral fractures in the placebo arms of the FREEDOM<ORGANIZATION> ( placebo IR 7.2 % ), FIT-1 ( placebo IR 15.0 % ), and FIT-2 ( placebo IR 3.8 % ) trials. NNT<ORGANIZATION> for ABL<ORGANIZATION> in ACTIVE<GPE> was 28 for vertebral, 55 for nonvertebral, 37 for clinical, and 34 for major osteoporotic fracture. NNT<ORGANIZATION> for these fracture types for teriparatide in ACTIVE were 30, 92, 59, and 75, respectively. Using placebo IRs from FREEDOM<GPE>, FIT-1, and FIT-2, projected NNTs<ORGANIZATION> for vertebral fracture with ABL<ORGANIZATION> were 17, 8, and 31. These data are useful for further evaluating ABL<ORGANIZATION> for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
