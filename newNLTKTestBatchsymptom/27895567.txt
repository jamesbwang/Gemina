 Searching for evidence of consciousness in outwardly unresponsive patients presents significant clinical challenges as the spectrum of disorders of consciousness has become more clearly defined, with clinical examination, functional MRI<ORGANIZATION>, and electrophysiologic tests having complementary roles in the investigation of minimally conscious patients, those in a locked-in state, coma, or in a vegetative state. Serial bedside electrophysiologic testing can probe for higher order cortical responses temporally and spatially propagated through cortical networks, while long-latency event-related potentials may help differentiate patients with coma or vegetative state from a state of residual consciousness. Transcranial magnetic stimulation co-registered to high-density EEG<ORGANIZATION> may reveal widespread pulse-stimulated cortical activation of various brain regions. These emerging electrophysiologic techniques show promise as powerful diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools.
