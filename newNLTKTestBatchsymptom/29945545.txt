 Low<PERSON> LET<ORGANIZATION> Ionizing radiation is known to alter intracellular redox balance by inducing free radical generation, which may cause oxidative modification of various cellular biomolecules. The extent of biomolecule-modifications/ damages and changes in vital processes ( viz. cellular homeostasis, inter-/intra-cellular signaling, mitochondrial physiology/dynamics antioxidant defence systems ) are crucial which in turn determine fate of cells. In the present study, we expended TLR<ORGANIZATION> expressing ( normal/ transformed ) and TLR<ORGANIZATION> null cells ; and we have shown that mannan pretreatment in TLR<ORGANIZATION> expressing normal cells offers survival advantage against lethal doses of ionizing radiation. On the contrary, mannan pretreatment does not offer any protection against radiation to TLR<ORGANIZATION> null cells, NKE<ORGANIZATION> ρ° cells and transformed cells. In normal cells, abrupt decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and endogenous ROS<ORGANIZATION> levels occurs following treatment with mannan. We intend to irradiate mannan-pretreated cells at a specific stage of perturbed mitochondrial functioning and ROS<ORGANIZATION> levels to comprehend if mannan pretreatment offers any survival advantage against radiation exposure to cells. Interestingly, pre-irradiation treatment of cells with mannan activates NFκB<ORGANIZATION>, p38 and JNK<ORGANIZATION>, alters mitochondrial physiology, increases expression of Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD<ORGANIZATION>, minimizes oxidation of mitochondrial phospholipids and offers survival advantage in comparison to irradiated group, in TLR<ORGANIZATION> expressing normal cells. The study demonstrates that TLR<ORGANIZATION> and mitochondrial ETC<ORGANIZATION> functions are inevitable in radio-protective efficacy exhibited by mannan.
