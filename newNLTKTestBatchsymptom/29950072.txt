 To compare the effect of integration processing technology of origin ( IPTO<ORGANIZATION> ) and traditional cutting processing technology ( TCPT<ORGANIZATION> ) of Moslae<GPE> Herba for lung-Yang deficiency rats caused by complex factors, analyze the mechanism, and provide the modern pharmacology basis for the implementation of IPTO<ORGANIZATION> of Moslae Herba<GPE>. The rat models of lung-Yang deficiency were established by smoking + swimming in ice water + drinking ice water. The model rats were randomly divided into different groups, and were treated with intragastric administration for 30 d. Then the general signs, anal temperature and autonomic activity of the rats were observed. The pathological morphology of lung tissues was observed, and the positive expression of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-α ) was observed by immunohistochemical method, and the hematological indexes were determined. Enzyme<PERSON> linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA<ORGANIZATION> ) method was used to detect serum nitric oxide ( NO<ORGANIZATION> ), immunoglobulin G ( IGG<ORGANIZATION> ), malondialdehyde ( MDA<ORGANIZATION> ), thromboxane B2 ( TXB2<ORGANIZATION> ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) level, and the organ coefficients of heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and other organs were calculated. According to the results, Moslae Herba<PERSON> volatile oil and decoction could improve the general signs and autonomic activities of lung-Yang deficiency rats, improve the body weight, rectal temperature, and the content of IGG<ORGANIZATION> in serum of lung-Yang deficiency rats, reduce organ coefficients of heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney, serum NO<ORGANIZATION>, MDA<ORGANIZATION>, TXB2<ORGANIZATION>, IL-8 contents, white blood cell and TNF-α mean optical density in the lung tissues of rats. witg statistically significant difference (
