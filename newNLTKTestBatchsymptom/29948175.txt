 Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ( PSP<ORGANIZATION> ) is a four-repeat tauopathy with high phenotypic and neuropathological variability, highlighting the urgent need for effective disease biomarkers. Quantitative analysis of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF<ORGANIZATION> ) proteins reflecting pathological changes of CNS<ORGANIZATION> is currently used as biomarkers of multiple neurodegenerative disorders for both early differential diagnosis and prognostic clustering of patients. In this study, we thus assessed the clinical usefulness of a panel of CSF<ORGANIZATION> biomarker in PSP<ORGANIZATION> patients presenting with Richardson<PERSON> 's Syndrome. CSF<ORGANIZATION> levels of 42-beta-amyloid, total-tau, phosphorylated-tau, and both 42-beta-amyloid/phosphorylated-tau and phosphorylated-tau/total-tau ratios were comparatively evaluated in 39 PSP patients, 31 patients with Parkinson<PERSON> 's Disease<GPE> ( PD ) and 58 gender-/age-matched healthy controls. Specific gold-standard clinical scores were obtained. Diagnostic<PERSON> accuracy and clinical correlates of each biomarker were measured with receiver operating curve analysis and Spearman<PERSON> 's test/linear regression, respectively. In PSP<ORGANIZATION>, 42-beta-amyloid was lower than either controls or PD<ORGANIZATION> ; total-tau and phosphorylated-tau were instead reduced compared to controls, but similar to PD. At the cut-off value of 623 pg/ml, 42-beta-amyloid significantly distinguished PSP<ORGANIZATION> from controls and PD<ORGANIZATION>. Likewise<PERSON>, phosphorylated-tau/total-tau ratio also supported differential diagnosis between PSP<ORGANIZATION> and PD<ORGANIZATION> ( cut-off = 0.185 ). 42-beta-amyloid was inversely associated with PSP<ORGANIZATION> severity, as measured with PSP<ORGANIZATION> Rating Scale. Our study demonstrates that CSF<ORGANIZATION> 42-beta-amyloid is reduced in PSP<ORGANIZATION> patients, proportionally to clinical severity, thus suggesting a potential use as disease biomarker. Moreover, phosphorylated-tau/total-tau ratio resulted helpful in the early differential diagnosis between PSP<ORGANIZATION> and PD<ORGANIZATION>.
