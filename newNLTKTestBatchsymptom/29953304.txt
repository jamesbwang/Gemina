 Purpose<GPE> Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT<ORGANIZATION> ) has been shown to alleviate psychological distress in patients with cancer. However, patients experience barriers to participating in face-to-face MBCT<ORGANIZATION>. Individual Internet-based MBCT<ORGANIZATION> ( eMBCT<ORGANIZATION> ) could be an alternative. The study aim was to compare MBCT<ORGANIZATION> and eMBCT with treatment as usual ( TAU<ORGANIZATION> ) for psychological distress in patients with cancer. Patients and Methods<ORGANIZATION> We obtained ethical and safety approval to include 245 patients with cancer with psychological distress ( â‰¥ 11 on the Hospital Anxiety<ORGANIZATION> and Depression Scale<ORGANIZATION> ) in the study. They were randomly allocated to MBCT<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 77 ), eMBCT ( n = 90 ), or TAU<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 78 ). Patients completed baseline ( T0 ) and postintervention ( T1 ) assessments. The primary outcome was psychological distress on the Hospital Anxiety<ORGANIZATION> and Depression Scale<ORGANIZATION>. Secondary outcomes were psychiatric diagnosis, fear of cancer recurrence, rumination, health-related quality of life, mindfulness skills, and positive mental health. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed modeling on the intention-to-treat sample. Because both interventions were compared with TAU<ORGANIZATION>, the type I error rate was set at P<FACILITY> < .025. Results<PERSON> Compared with TAU<ORGANIZATION>, patients reported significantly less psychological distress after both MBCT<ORGANIZATION> ( Cohen<PERSON> 's d, .45 ; P<PERSON> < .001 ) and eMBCT ( Cohen<PERSON> 's d, .71 ; P<PERSON> < .001 ). In addition, post-treatment prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis was lower with both MBCT<ORGANIZATION> ( 33 % improvement ; P<PERSON> = .030 ) and eMBCT ( 29 % improvement ; P<PERSON> = .076 ) in comparison with TAU<ORGANIZATION> ( 16 % ), but these changes were not statistically significant. Both interventions reduced fear of cancer recurrence and rumination, and increased mental health-related quality of life, mindfulness skills, and positive mental health compared with TAU<ORGANIZATION> ( all Ps < .025 ). Physical health-related quality of life did not improve ( P<PERSON> = .343 ). Conclusion Compared with TAU<ORGANIZATION>, MBCT<ORGANIZATION> and eMBCT<ORGANIZATION> were similarly effective in reducing psychological distress in a sample of distressed heterogeneous patients with cancer.
