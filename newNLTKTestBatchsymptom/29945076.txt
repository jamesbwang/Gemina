 Death<GPE> by suicide is one of the leading causes of mortality among adolescents, and nonsuicidal self-injury ( NSSI<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the strongest predictors of suicide attempts ( SAs<ORGANIZATION> ). The underlying bases for this relationship are unknown. We derived two hypotheses from the Interpersonal Psychological<ORGANIZATION> Theory of Suicide<GPE> ( IPTS<ORGANIZATION> ): unmet interpersonal needs would explain NSSI<ORGANIZATION> 's association with suicidal ideation ( SI ) and increased capability for suicide would explain NSSI<ORGANIZATION> 's relationship with SA<ORGANIZATION>. Adolescents hospitalized on a psychiatric inpatient unit ( N = 289 ) provided measures of current SI, number of past SAs<ORGANIZATION>, unmet interpersonal needs ( perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness ), capability for suicide ( fearlessness about death [ FAD<ORGANIZATION> ] and pain tolerance ), depressive symptoms, and number of NSSI<ORGANIZATION> methods utilized. Depressive symptoms, but not unmet interpersonal needs, explained NSSI<ORGANIZATION> 's association with SI<ORGANIZATION>. FAD<ORGANIZATION> and SI<ORGANIZATION>, but not depressive symptoms or pain tolerance, accounted for NSSI<ORGANIZATION> 's relationship with SA<ORGANIZATION>. FAD<ORGANIZATION> was associated with SA<ORGANIZATION>, but it did not fully account for NSSI<ORGANIZATION> 's relationship with SA<ORGANIZATION>. This study utilized a cross-sectional design and retrospective, self-report measures. Our study provides partial support for the role of the IPTS<ORGANIZATION> variables in NSSI<ORGANIZATION> 's relationship with SA<ORGANIZATION> in adolescents. The finding that depressive symptoms and not unmet interpersonal needs explained NSSI<ORGANIZATION> 's relationship with SI<ORGANIZATION> contradicts the IPTS<ORGANIZATION>. However, in those with SI<ORGANIZATION>, FAD<ORGANIZATION> was linearly associated with SA<ORGANIZATION>, which is consistent with the IPTS<ORGANIZATION>. Future studies are needed to clarify the persistent basis for NSSI<ORGANIZATION> 's relationship with SA<ORGANIZATION> beyond FAD<ORGANIZATION> and SI<ORGANIZATION>.
