 Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus dysgalactiae is a well-known pathogen for a wide range of animals and humans. Two subspecies are recognized: ( i ) equisimilis, associated to disease in horses and humans, and ( ii ) dysgalactiae mainly isolated from animal illness with only a few humans ' cases. This study describes the isolation and characterization of Streptococcus<GPE> dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae ( SDSD<ORGANIZATION> ) from vampire bats, maintained in captivity for research proposes. Animals<PERSON> presented neurologic, respiratory and gastroenteric symptoms and sudden death. Beta-hemolytic Gram-positive cocci were isolated in blood agar plates and further characterized as Lancefield<ORGANIZATION> group C. All isolates were identified as S. dysgalactiae by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight ( MALDI-TOF ) mass spectrometry and subspecies dysgalactiae was confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Genotyping through SE-ALFP resulted in three profiles ( A1-A3 ) with one bat being infected by profiles A1 and A3. This is the first report of SDSD<ORGANIZATION> causing illness in bats and especially in Desmodus<GPE> rotundus species.
