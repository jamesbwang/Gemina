 Metal<ORGANIZATION> organic framework ( MOF<ORGANIZATION> ) /polymer composite membranes are of interest for gas separations as they often have performance that exceeds the neat polymer. However, traditional composite membranes, known as mixed matrix membranes ( MMMs<ORGANIZATION> ), can have complex and time-consuming preparation procedures. The MOF<ORGANIZATION> and polymer are traditionally prepared separately, and require priming and mixing to ensure uniform distribution of particles and compatibility of the polymer/particle interface. In this study, we reduce the number of steps using an in-situ MOF<ORGANIZATION> growth strategy. Herein<PERSON>, MMMs<ORGANIZATION> are prepared by growing MOF<ORGANIZATION> ( UiO-66 ) in-situ within a MatrimidÂ® polymer matrix while simultaneously curing the matrix. The gas separation performance for MMMs<ORGANIZATION> prepared using this approach was evaluated for CO2/N2 separation and compared to MMMs<ORGANIZATION> made using the traditional post-synthesis mixing. It was found that MMMs<ORGANIZATION> prepared using both the in-situ MOF<ORGANIZATION> growth strategy and by traditional post-synthesis mixing are equivalent in performance. However, using in-situ MOF<ORGANIZATION> growth allows for a simpler, faster, and potentially more economical fabrication alternative for MMMs<ORGANIZATION>.
