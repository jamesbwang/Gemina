The PHC<ORGANIZATION> structures are acceptable ; however, the system is marked by maldistribution of resources, fragmentation of services and shortage of staff. This hampers the function of the set, well-meaning PHC<ORGANIZATION> frameworks. Family<PERSON> medicine offers training and retention of the PHC<ORGANIZATION> and rural workforce, harnessing clinical governance and capacity building. Family<PERSON> medicine 's role extends to involve advocacy for the PHC<ORGANIZATION> to improve its performance.
