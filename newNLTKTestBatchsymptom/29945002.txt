 This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of screw placement and clinical outcomes in occipitocervical fusion patients. Patients who underwent occipitocervical fusion with O-arm-based navigation were retrospectively reviewed between January 2015 and December 2017. Patients<PERSON> ' characteristics, clinical and radiographic outcomes, and surgical complications were recorded and analyzed. Cervical screw insertion accuracy was evaluated using the Richter<ORGANIZATION> scale. Thirty consecutive patients ( 11 male and 19 female ) with an average treatment age of 40.03±15.19 years were studied. The most common etiology was atlantoaxial instability combined with Chiari<GPE> malformation ( 63.33 % ). Weakness ( 76.67 % ) and paresthesia ( 70.00 % ) were the most common symptoms. Eight-six occipital and 139 cervical screws were placed using O-arm-assisted navigation system. In total, 130 ( 93.53 % ) cervical screws were graded as Group A<PERSON>, while 9 ( 6.47 % ) as Group B<PERSON>. The optimal accuracy rate was 88.41 % ( 61 of 69 screws ) in the first 15 patients but was 98.57 % ( 69 of 70 screws ) in the subsequent 15 patients. The mean follow-up was 7.50±5.70 months. The mean Japanese<GPE> Orthopedic Association ( JOA<ORGANIZATION> ) score was 13.30±2.41 preoperatively and 15.30±1.60 at final follow-up ( p < 0.001 ) and the mean recovery rate in JOA<ORGANIZATION> score was 53.26±33.82 %. Clinical<PERSON> improvement was seen in 25 patients ( 83.33 % ), while no changed was observed in 5 patients ( 16.67 % ). The overall complication rate of was 6.67 % ( 2/30 ) with one intraoperatively vertebral artery injury and one postoperatively screw loosening. Occipitocervical fusion with O-arm-based navigation is effective and safe for treating instability of craniovertebral junction. Intraoperative navigation can help surgeons insert screws accurately.
