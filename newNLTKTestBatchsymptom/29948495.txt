 Hyperactive<GPE> delirium ( agitation ) is a common complication in patients on intensive care units and can be assessed by the Richmond Agitation<ORGANIZATION> and Sedation Scale<ORGANIZATION> ( RASS<ORGANIZATION> ) in principle. However, the role of agitation in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH<ORGANIZATION> ) is poorly understood. We performed a retrospective analysis to identify risk factors for the development of a hyperactive delirium and its functional consequences for neurological outcome. Three hundred thirty-eight patients with SAH<ORGANIZATION> were screened in this study resulting in 212 patients which reached at least once a RASS<ORGANIZATION> of 0 and were eligible for further analysis. Clinical<PERSON> characteristics were analysed towards the occurrence of a hyperactive delirium. Neurological outcome at discharge and follow-up was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale<ORGANIZATION>. Seventy-eight of 212 patients ( 36.8 % ) developed a hyperactive delirium ; the duration ranged from 1 to 11 days. Multivariate regression revealed initial hydrocephalus ( odds ratio ( OR ) 3.21 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) [ 1.33-7.70 ] ; p = 0.01 ), microsurgical clipping ( OR 3.70 95 % CI 1.71-8.01 ] ; p = 0.001 ), male gender ( OR 1.97 95 % CI [ 1.05-3.85 ] ; p = 0.047 ) and a higher Graeb score ( OR 1.11 95 % CI [ 1.00-1.22 ] ; p = 0.043 ) to be significantly associated with the development of agitation. Medical<PERSON> history of psychiatric disorders, alcohol or nicotine abuse showed no correlation with agitation. Cox<PERSON> regression analysis revealed no significant influence of agitation towards unfavourable outcome at discharge or follow-up. We provide four independent risk factors for the development of agitation in SAH<ORGANIZATION> patients. Our study emphasizes the specific entity of agitation in patients with SAH<ORGANIZATION> and underscores its relevance in neurological patients.
