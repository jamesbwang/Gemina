 BACKGROUND Systemic<ORGANIZATION> inflammation plays a critical role in the pathophysiological process of intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH<ORGANIZATION> ). Recently, the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR<ORGANIZATION> ) has become a research focus that indicates inflammation in various diseases. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the predictive value of PLR<ORGANIZATION> in patients with acute ICH<ORGANIZATION>. MATERIAL<ORGANIZATION> AND METHODS<ORGANIZATION> This study was performed in a single teaching hospital. Glasgow<PERSON> coma scale at hospital discharge ( GCSdis<ORGANIZATION> ) and modified Rankin<PERSON> score ( MRS<ORGANIZATION> ) at 6 months were recorded as short-term and long-term neurological outcomes. Ordered<PERSON> and binary logistic regression methods were used to explore the associations. RESULTS Finally<ORGANIZATION>, data on 183 ICH patients were included. A knot of PLR<ORGANIZATION> around 100 was detected and applied in the extended ordered logistic regression models. For PLR<ORGANIZATION> > 100, PLR<ORGANIZATION> on ICU<ORGANIZATION> admission was significantly associated with worse GCSdis<ORGANIZATION> ( from Model 1: OR: 1.004, 95 % CI 1.001-1.007 to Model 4: OR: 1.006, 95 % CI 1.002-1.009 ) while the PLR<ORGANIZATION> on Emergency Department<ORGANIZATION> ( ED ) admission was insignificant. For PLR<ORGANIZATION> â‰¤100, neither the PLR<ORGANIZATION> on ICU<ORGANIZATION> or ED admission was associated with GCSdis<ORGANIZATION> level. In the quartile grouping analysis, PLR Q2<ORGANIZATION> was used as a reference level. Both Q3 and Q4 on ICU<ORGANIZATION> admission were significantly associated with lower GCSdis<ORGANIZATION> level ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 3.30 ; 95 % CI 1.38-7.88 ; and OR<ORGANIZATION>, 3.79 ; 95 % CI 1.54-9.33, respectively ), while Q1<PERSON> was insignificant. All 4 quartiles of PLR<ORGANIZATION> on ED admission were not associated with GCSdis<ORGANIZATION>. CONCLUSIONS Only higher PLR<ORGANIZATION> value on ICU<ORGANIZATION> admission but not on ED admission was associated with worse GCSdis<ORGANIZATION>.
