 The American Men<ORGANIZATION> 's Internet Survey ( AMIS<ORGANIZATION> ) is conducted annually with 10,000 men age 15 + who have sex with men ( MSM<ORGANIZATION> ). Modeling was used with 39,863 AMIS<ORGANIZATION> surveys from 4 cycles between December 2013 to February 2017 to identify temporal trends in sexual behavior, substance use, and testing behavior ( within 12 months preceding interview ) stratified by participants ' self-reported HIV status. HIV-negative/unknown status MSM<ORGANIZATION> had significant increases in condomless anal intercourse ( CAI<ORGANIZATION> ), marijuana use, use of other illicit substances, sexually transmitted infection ( STI<ORGANIZATION> ) diagnoses, and HIV<ORGANIZATION> or STI<ORGANIZATION> testing ( testing only increased among MSM<ORGANIZATION> age 25 + ). HIV-negative/unknown status MSM<ORGANIZATION> had significant decrease in CAI<ORGANIZATION> with an HIV-positive or unknown status partner. HIV-positive MSM<ORGANIZATION> had significant increases in CAI<ORGANIZATION>, methamphetamine use, and STI<ORGANIZATION> diagnoses/testing. Although encouraging, the few indicators of improvement in HIV/STI sexual health practices are not consistently seen across sub-groups of MSM<ORGANIZATION> and may be counteracted by growing proportions of MSM<ORGANIZATION> engaging in CAI<ORGANIZATION> and acquiring STIs<ORGANIZATION>.
