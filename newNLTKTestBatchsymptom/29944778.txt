 In cancer cachexia, abnormal metabolism and neuroendocrine dysfunction cause anorexia, tissue damage, and atrophy, which can in turn alter body fluid balance. Arginine<PERSON> vasopressin ( AVP<ORGANIZATION> ), which regulates fluid homeostasis, is secreted by magnocellular neurosecretory cells ( MNCs<ORGANIZATION> ) of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus ( SON<ORGANIZATION> ). AVP<ORGANIZATION> secretion by MNCs<ORGANIZATION> is regulated by both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity, alterations in plasma osmolarity, and various peptides including angiotensin II. Here, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of brain slices to determine whether hyperosmotic stimulation and/or angiotensin II potentiate excitatory synaptic input in a rat model of cancer cachexia, as they do in normal ( control ) rats. Hyperosmotic ( 15 mM and 60 mM mannitol ) stimulation and angiotensin II ( 0.1 Î¼M ) increased the frequency, but not the amplitude, of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents ( mEPSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) in normal rats ; in model rats, both effects were significantly attenuated. These results suggest that cancer cachexia alters supraoptic MNC<ORGANIZATION> sensitivity to osmotic and angiotensin II stimulation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
