 The pulmonary extracellular matrix ( ECM<ORGANIZATION> ) is a complex network of proteins which primarily defines tissue architecture and regulates various biochemical and biophysical processes. It is a dynamic system comprising two main structures ( the interstitial matrix and the basement membrane ) which undergo continuous, yet highly regulated, remodelling. This remodelling process is essential for tissue homeostasis and uncontrolled regulation can lead to pathological states including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ). Altered expression of ECM<ORGANIZATION> proteins, as observed in COPD<GPE>, can contribute to the degradation of alveolar walls and thickening of the small airways which can cause limitations in airflow. Modifications in ECM<ORGANIZATION> composition can also impact immune cell migration and retention in the lung with migrating cells becoming entrapped in the diseased airspaces. Furthermore, ECM<ORGANIZATION> changes affect the lung microbiome, aggravating and advancing disease progression. A dysbiosis in bacterial diversity can lead to infection, inducing epithelial injury and pro-inflammatory reactions. Here we review the changes noted in the different ECM<ORGANIZATION> components in COPD<ORGANIZATION> and discuss how an imbalance in microbial commensalism can impact disease development.
