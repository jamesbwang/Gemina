 Fibromyalgia<GPE> is a complex syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain and a heightened response to pressure. Most medical researches pointed out that fibromyalgia patients with endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness. A continuous-wave NIRS<ORGANIZATION> system is used in present study to measure the hemodynamic changes elicited by breath-holding task in patients with fibromyalgia. Each patient completed a questionnaire survey including demographics, characteristics of body pain, associated symptoms, headache profiles, and Hospital Anxiety<ORGANIZATION> and Depression Scale<ORGANIZATION>. A total of twenty-seven fibromyalgia ( FM ) patients and twenty-six health controls were enrolled. In comparison with healthy controls, patients with FM<ORGANIZATION> showed lower maximal and averaged change of oxyhemoglobin concentration in both the left ( 1.634±0.890μM and 0.810±0.525μM ) and the right ( 1.576±0.897μM and 0.811±0.601μM ) prefrontal cortex than healthy controls ( p < 0.05 for both sides ) during the breath-holding task. In conclusion, FM<ORGANIZATION> is associated with altered cerebrovascular reactivity measured by NIRS<ORGANIZATION> and breath-holding task, which may reflect endothelial dysfunction or arterial stiffness.
