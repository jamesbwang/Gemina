 The retina has been used to study the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis ( MS ). Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer ( pRNFL<ORGANIZATION> ) thinning has been suggested as an ocular biomarker of neurodegeneration in MS. The goal of this project was to determine the birefringence of the pRNFL<ORGANIZATION> by measuring the fiber birefringence using polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography ( PS-OCT ). Sixty-six MS patients without history of optic neuritis ( age: 39.9 ± 11.0 yrs. old, 53 females and 13 males ) and 66 age- and gender-matched normal controls ( age: 40.7 ± 11.4 yrs. old ) were recruited. Custom<PERSON> built PS-OCT was used to measure phase retardation per unit depth ( PR/UD, proportional to the birefringence ) and pRNFL<ORGANIZATION> thickness in each quadrant of the pRNFL<ORGANIZATION>. In addition, clinical manifestation was used to correlate with the pRNFL<ORGANIZATION> birefringence. The pRNFL<ORGANIZATION> was thinner in the temporal and inferior quadrants in MS patients compared with normal controls ( This is the first study using PS-OCT to study the pRNFL<ORGANIZATION> birefringence in MS patients. Decreased birefringence of the pRNFL<ORGANIZATION> may indicate microtubule abnormality, and could be a potential biomarker for detecting early neurodegeneration in MS.
