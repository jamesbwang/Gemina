 This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( PNMES<ORGANIZATION> ) for treating neck pain in patients with cervical spondylosis ( CS ). One hundred and twenty four patients with neck pain of CS were included, and then they were randomly divided into a PNMES<ORGANIZATION> group and a control group in a ratio of 1:1. All patients received PNMES<ORGANIZATION> or sham PNMES 30 minutes daily, 3 times weekly for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was assessed by the visual analog scale ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> ). The secondary outcomes were evaluated by the cervical range of motion ( ROM<ORGANIZATION> ), neck disability index ( NDI<ORGANIZATION> ) score, as well as the adverse events ( AEs<ORGANIZATION> ). All outcome measurements were measured at the end of 12-week treatment, and 4-week follow-up after treatment. At the end of the 12-week treatment, and 4-week follow-up, the patients receiving PNMES<ORGANIZATION> exhibited more decrease in the mean VAS<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < .01 ), and NDI<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < .01 ) respectively, compared with the patients receiving sham PNMES. Additionally, the increase in the mean ROM<ORGANIZATION> was also significantly higher in the PNMES<ORGANIZATION> group than that in the sham PNMES<ORGANIZATION> group at the end of the 12-week treatment, and 4-week follow-up, respectively ( P<PERSON> < .01 ). No AEs were found in either group. The results of this study demonstrated that PNMES<ORGANIZATION> is more effective than Sham PNMES<PERSON> for neck pain relief in patients with CS<ORGANIZATION>.
