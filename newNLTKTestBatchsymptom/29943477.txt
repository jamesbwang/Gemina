 Paediatric<GPE> emergency tapes provide drug dosing based on the patient 's estimated body weight. Unfortunately, published data revealed an unsatisfactory accuracy. A newly developed digital algorithm for weight estimation ( CLAWAR<ORGANIZATION> ) allowing a three-staged habitus adaptation ( normal, obese, or cachectic ; CLAWAR-3 ) demonstrated a higher accuracy for weight estimation compared to paediatric emergency tapes. However, the incidence of incorrectly evaluated habitus was 27 %. A five-staged habitus adaptation with figural images was suggested by Wells<PERSON> et al to improve habitus and weight estimation. Therefore, CLAWAR<ORGANIZATION> was modified with five habitus stages including figural images ( CLAWAR-5 ). We hypothized CLAWAR-5 improves the accuracy of weight estimation. After obtaining informed written parental consent patients were included in this single centre, prospective clinical observation trial. Body<PERSON> weight estimations by CLAWAR-3 and CLAWAR-5 within ±10 % of the actual body weight were compared. Furthermore, the incidence of correct evaluated habitus was calculated. McNemar Tests<ORGANIZATION> were used for statistical analysis. Results<PERSON> presented as median ( interquartiles ), P<PERSON> < .003 considered significant. In total, 312 patients aged 3.3 years ( 0.7-6.6 ), with a body length of 95.9 cm ( 70.0-121.2 ), weighing 14.8 kg ( 8.1-22.5 ), were included. Both CLAWAR-3 and CLAWAR-5 showed equivalent accuracy for weight estimation within the ±10 % interval ( 62.2 % vs 60.6 %, P<PERSON> = .609 ). Despite adding figural images, the incidence of correct evaluated habitus with CLAWAR-5 ( 46.8 % ) was worse than with CLAWAR-3 ( 66.7 % ). The five-staged habitus-adapted method could not improve the accuracy of weight estimation. Furthermore, the error rate of habitus classification was not reduced by the implementation of figural images.
