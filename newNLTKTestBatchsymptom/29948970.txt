 In clinical practice, few prostate cancer ( PCa<ORGANIZATION> ) patients are associated with metabolic syndrome ( MetS<ORGANIZATION> ), while few others acquire MetS<ORGANIZATION> during treatment. Whether the treatment of PCa<ORGANIZATION> increases the occurrence of MetS<ORGANIZATION> remains to be confirmed. This study reviewed the changes in MetS<ORGANIZATION> patients before and after PCa<ORGANIZATION> treatment to evaluate the effects of various treatment methods on MetS<ORGANIZATION>. We analyzed data of 1162 PCa patients, whether or not diagnosed with MetS<ORGANIZATION>, and changes in MetS<ORGANIZATION> patients after PCa<ORGANIZATION> treatment. Data of lower urinary tract symptoms, C-reactive protein ( CRP<ORGANIZATION> ), platelet distribution width ( PDW<ORGANIZATION> ), prostate-specific antigen ( PSA<ORGANIZATION> ), Gleason<PERSON> score, clinical stage, treatment methods, and progressive incidents were evaluated using logistic regression according to MetS<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis. The results showed significant differences in the prevalence of MetS<ORGANIZATION> before ( 17.38 % ) and after ( 23.67 % ) PCa<ORGANIZATION> treatment ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). Bad diet, living habits, and prostate cancer treatment were considered as risk factors for MetS<ORGANIZATION> ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.731, 95 % CI 1.367-2.193, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). Radical prostatectomy ( RP ), androgen deprivation therapy including surgical castration and medical castration, iodine-125 seed brachytherapy (
