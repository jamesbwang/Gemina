 Cerebrovascular<GPE> injury ( CVI<ORGANIZATION> ) is a recognized but underappreciated complication of acute type B aortic dissection ( ATBAD<ORGANIZATION> ). This study was performed to determine risk factors for CVI<ORGANIZATION> associated with ATBAD<ORGANIZATION> and, in particular, the possible contributory role of aggressive anti-impulse therapy. A retrospective review of all patients presenting to a tertiary medical center with an ATBAD between January 2003 and October 2012 was conducted. All CVIs were adjudicated by a vascular neurologist and assigned a probable cause. The initial intensity of anti-impulse therapy was defined as the difference in mean arterial pressure ( ΔMAP<ORGANIZATION> ) from presentation to subsequent admission to the intensive care unit. A total of 112 patients were identified. The average age was 61 years ; 64 % were male, and 59 % were African American<ORGANIZATION>. Twenty patients required operative intervention ( 14 thoracic endovascular aortic repairs and 6 open ). CVI<ORGANIZATION> occurred in 13 patients ( 11.6 % ): 9 were hypoperfusion related ( 6 diffuse hypoxic brain injuries and 3 watershed infarcts ), 2 were procedure related ( both thoracic endovascular aortic repairs ), 1 was an intracranial hemorrhage on presentation, and 1 was a probable embolic stroke on presentation. CVI<ORGANIZATION> patients had demographics and comorbidities comparable to those of the non-CVI patients. CVI<ORGANIZATION> was associated with operative intervention ( 54 % vs 13 % ; P<PERSON> = .002 ). Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in CVI<ORGANIZATION> patients ( 54 % vs 6 % ; P<PERSON> < .001 ). Patients who suffered a hypoperfusion brain injury had a higher MAP<ORGANIZATION> on presentation to the emergency department ( 142 mm Hg vs 120 mm Hg ; P<PERSON> = .034 ) and a significantly greater reduction in MAP<GPE> ( ΔMAP 49 mm Hg vs 15 mm Hg ; P<PERSON> < .001 ) by the time they reached the intensive care unit compared with the non-CVI patients. In our series, CVI<ORGANIZATION> in ATBAD<GPE> is more frequent than previously reported and is associated with increased mortality. The most common causes are related to cerebral hypoperfusion. Higher MAP<ORGANIZATION> on presentation and greater decline in MAP are associated risk factors for hypoperfusion-related CVI<ORGANIZATION>. A less aggressive approach to lowering MAP<ORGANIZATION> in ATBAD<GPE> warrants further study in an attempt to reduce CVI<ORGANIZATION> in ATBAD<GPE>.
