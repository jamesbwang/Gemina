 With the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium<GPE> tuberculosis there is a pressing need for new oral drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Herein<PERSON>, we describe the identification of a novel morpholino-thiophenes ( MOT<ORGANIZATION> ) series following phenotypic screening of the Eli Lilly<ORGANIZATION> corporate library against M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv<PERSON>. The design, synthesis and structure activity relationships of a range of analogs around the confirmed actives are described. Optimised leads with potent whole cell activity against H37Rv<GPE>, no cytotoxicity flags and in vivo efficacy in an acute murine model of infection are described. Mode-of-action studies suggest that the novel scaffold targets QcrB<ORGANIZATION>, a subunit of the menaquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase, part of the bc1-aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase complex that is responsible for driving oxygen-dependent respiration.
