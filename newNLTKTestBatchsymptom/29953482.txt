 Skeletal<GPE> muscle fatigue has been shown to be associated with hyperphosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor 1 at serine 2843 ( pRyR1Ser2843<ORGANIZATION> ), due to chronic overloading exercise. We investigated whether pRyR1Ser2843<ORGANIZATION>, is a mechanism relevant for muscle fatigue also under acute, in contrast to chronic, muscle loading. 24 male subjects ( age: 24,8±3,8 ; height: 182,8±7,2 cm ; weight: 82,5±9,9 kg ) were evenly ( n = 6 ) assigned to the following four different resistance exercise ( RE ) groups: hypertrophy- ( HYP<ORGANIZATION> ), strength endurance- ( SE ), maximum power- ( MAX<ORGANIZATION> ) at the subjects ' 10, 25 and 3 repetition maximum, respectively, and low intensity ( LI ) RE with 70 % of the 10 repetition maximum. Each group completed three different RE volumes ( 1 set, 5, and 10 sets ). Muscle<PERSON> biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken before and after exercise, analyzed for pRyR1Ser2843<ORGANIZATION> and examined for association with RE-induced muscle fatigue which was determined as reduction in maximum isometric force ( isoFmax<ORGANIZATION> ) in the quadriceps femoris muscle also before and after exercise.The degree of RE-induced muscle fatigue was specific in terms of set volume as well as of RE<ORGANIZATION> mode. isoFmax<ORGANIZATION> was not reduced in any group after one set of RE<ORGANIZATION>. Five sets led to a significant reduction of isoFmax<ORGANIZATION> in HYP<ORGANIZATION> and SE but not in LI and MAX<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0,05 ). Ten sets of RE<ORGANIZATION>, as compared to five sets, exclusively induced further muscle fatigue in LI. In terms of RE<ORGANIZATION> mode differences, isoFmax<ORGANIZATION> reduction was generally higher in HYP<ORGANIZATION> and SE than in MAX<ORGANIZATION> and Li after five and ten sets of RE<GPE> ( p < 0,05 ). However, pRyR1Ser2843<ORGANIZATION> did not show any significant regulation, regardless of exercise condition. We conclude that despite its relevance in reducing muscle contractility in chronic overloading, pRyR1Ser2843<ORGANIZATION> does not reflect the degree of muscle fatigue exerted by acute hypertrophy-, strength endurance-, maximum power and low intensity-oriented exercise.
