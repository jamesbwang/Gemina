 Cancer<GPE> of the urethra is very rare with an age-adjusted incidence of only 0.6 per million women in Europe<GPE>. The etiology is multifactorial and the incidence increases with age, with the highest rates in patients 75 years or older. We herein describe a 58-year-old woman referred to our unit due to pollakisuria and repeated lower urinary tract infections. The gynecological examination revealed a suspect area in the anterior wall of vagina. Subsequently, ultrasound examination, MRI<ORGANIZATION>, and PET-CT scan followed by vaginal biopsies revealed a urethral adenocarcinoma.
