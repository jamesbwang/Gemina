 Chronic<GPE> kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ) is described as a progressive alteration of kidney function, resulting from multiple factors, including behaviours. We investigated the association of the Dietary Inflammatory Index<ORGANIZATION> ( DII® ) with prevalent CKD in adult Americans. National Health<ORGANIZATION> and Nutrition Examination<ORGANIZATION> Survey participants with measured data on kidney function markers from 2005 to 2012 were included in this study. Prevalent CKD was based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) < 60 ml/min per 1·73 m2 or urinary albumin/creatinine≥30 mg/g. Energy-adjusted DII<ORGANIZATION> ( E-DIITM ) scores were calculated from 24-h dietary recalls. Statistical analyses accounted for the survey design and sample weights. We included 21 649 participants, with 1634 ( 6·8 % ) having prevalent CKD<ORGANIZATION>. Participants with high E-DII scores had greater BMI<ORGANIZATION>, fasting blood glucose and systolic blood pressure, and were more likely to be diabetic or hypertensive ( all P < 0·001 ) compared with those with lower E-DII scores. In regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, BMI<ORGANIZATION>, hypertension and diabetes status, mean eGFR significantly decreased across increasing quartiles of E-DII, whereas serum uric acid level and log urinary albumin: creatinine ratio significantly increased ( all P < 0·001 ). Prevalent CKD<ORGANIZATION> increased from 5·3 % in the lowest to 9·3 % in the highest E-DII quartile ( P=0·02 ). In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, the odds of prevalent CKD were 29 % higher in the highest compared with the lowest E-DII quartile. Pro-inflammatory diet is associated with declining kidney function and high prevalence of CKD<ORGANIZATION>. Dietary changes that reduce inflammation have a potential to prevent CKD<ORGANIZATION>.
