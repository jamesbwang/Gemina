 Little<GPE> data exist on acute kidney injury ( AKI<ORGANIZATION> ) risk factors in pediatric sepsis. We identified risk factors and inpatient outcomes associated with AKI<ORGANIZATION> at sepsis recognition in children with severe sepsis. Retrospective, cross-sectional study with inpatient outcome description of 315 patients > 1 month to < 20 years old with severe sepsis in a pediatric intensive care unit over 3 years. Exposures<PERSON> included demographics, vitals, and laboratory data. The primary outcome was kidney disease: Improving Global Outcomes<PERSON> creatinine-defined AKI<ORGANIZATION> within 24 h of sepsis recognition. Factors<PERSON> associated with AKI<ORGANIZATION> and AKI<ORGANIZATION> severity were identified using multivariable Poisson<PERSON> and multinomial logistic regression, respectively. AKI<PERSON> was present in 42 % ( 133/315 ) of severe sepsis patients, and 26 % ( 83/315 ) had severe ( stage 2/3 ) AKI<ORGANIZATION>. In multivariable-adjusted analysis, hematologic/immunologic comorbidities, malignancies, chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ), abdominal infection, admission illness severity, and minimum systolic blood pressure ( SBP<ORGANIZATION> ) ≤ 5th percentile for age and sex within 24 h of sepsis recognition were associated with AKI<ORGANIZATION>. Factors<PERSON> associated with mild AKI were CKD<ORGANIZATION> and abdominal infection, while factors associated with severe AKI were younger age, hematologic/immunologic comorbidities, malignancy, abdominal infection, and minimum SBP<ORGANIZATION> ≤ 5th percentile. Patients with AKI<ORGANIZATION> had increased hospital mortality ( 17 vs. 8 %, P<PERSON> = 0.02 ) and length of stay [ median 20 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 10-47 ) vs. 16 days ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 7-37 ), P<PERSON> = 0.03 ]. In pediatric severe sepsis, AKI<ORGANIZATION> is associated with age, comorbidities, infection characteristics, and hypotension. Future evaluation of risk factors for AKI<ORGANIZATION> progression during sepsis is warranted to minimize AKI<ORGANIZATION> progression in this high-risk population.
