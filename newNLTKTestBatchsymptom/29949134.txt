 We aimed to explore the expression level and biological function of lncRNA<ORGANIZATION> PRNCR1<ORGANIZATION> in preeclampsia ( PE ). 57 PE patients and 57 normal pregnant women were enrolled in this study. The expression level of PRNCR1<ORGANIZATION> in the maternal placenta of PE<ORGANIZATION> patients and normal pregnancy was detected by qRT-PCR. The CCK-8 assay was carried out to determine the cell viability after interference and overexpression of PRNCR1<ORGANIZATION> on trophoblasts. We utilized Western<LOCATION> blot to examine the protein level of PRNCR1<ORGANIZATION>. Higher<PERSON> systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and urinary protein levels in PE patients were observed in comparison with those in normal pregnant women, while the neonatal weight in PE<ORGANIZATION> group was markedly lower than that in normal pregnant women. LncRNA<ORGANIZATION> PRNCR1 was overexpressed in PE patients, which was positively correlated with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and urine protein, whereas negatively correlated with fetal birth weight of PE<ORGANIZATION> patients. In addition, the expression of PRNCR1<ORGANIZATION> in BeWo<GPE> trophoblast cells was significantly decreased after the interference with PRNCR1<ORGANIZATION>, while the cell viability increased. However, overexpression of PRNCR1<ORGANIZATION> in HTR-8 cells significantly reduced the viability of cells. Expression levels of p-p38 and p-JNK in PE patients were higher than those in normal pregnancy women, and the expression level of p-ERK was decreased, which suggested that PRNCR1<ORGANIZATION> promoted the progression of PE by modulating the MAPK<ORGANIZATION> signaling pathway. PRNCR1<ORGANIZATION> is highly expressed in PE and promotes the progression of PE by modulating the MAPK<ORGANIZATION> signaling pathway.
