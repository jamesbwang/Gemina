 Chronic<GPE> obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Common in COPD are acute exacerbations ( AE-COPD ) that cause acute dyspnea, cough, and bronchospasm. Symptoms of AE-COPD mimic pulmonary embolism ( PE ). We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the prevalence of PE in patients admitted to the hospital with a clinical diagnosis of AE-COPD. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews<ORGANIZATION> and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we queried PubMed<ORGANIZATION> and MEDLINE<ORGANIZATION> databases from 1990 to 2017. The search term `` prevalence pulmonary embolism, COPD<ORGANIZATION> '' was used, and Boolean<GPE> operators were used to combine search terms. Data were extracted from each article, specifically the sample size, study setting, design, and the prevalence of PE<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 5 articles were included that demonstrated a prevalence of PE<ORGANIZATION> among patients with a clinical diagnosis of AE-COPD that ranged from 3.3-29.1 %. Sample<PERSON> sizes varied from 49-197 patients. Studies<PERSON> occurred in both emergency department and inpatient settings, including intensive care units. Among the studies that reported patient characteristics associated with PE<ORGANIZATION> in AE-COPD, both obesity and immobility were important. Studies reporting the prevalence of PE<ORGANIZATION> during AE-COPD vary considerably in their methods and results. Because of the relatively high prevalence of PE<ORGANIZATION> during AE-COPD, it is important for providers to be aware of this linkage between the 2 conditions and to screen patients using clinical gestalt and validated screening tools until more emergency department data are available.
