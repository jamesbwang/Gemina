 Solar<GPE> lentigines are common pigmentary lesions. Q-switched lasers are effective treatment options but postinflammatory hyperpigmentation ( PIH<ORGANIZATION> ) is common in darker skin. The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety in solar lentigines of Asian<GPE> skin treated by Q-switched potassium titanyl phosphate ( KTP<ORGANIZATION> ) 532-nm nanosecond laser vs. KTP<ORGANIZATION> 532-nm picosecond laser for the treatment of solar lentigines in Asians<GPE>. Thirty patients with at least 2 solar lentigines on the upper extremities were enrolled. A total of 30 paired lentiginous lesions were randomly treated with a single treatment of either Q-switched KTP<ORGANIZATION> 532-nm nanosecond laser vs. KTP<ORGANIZATION> 532-nm picosecond laser. In terms of efficacy, mean luminance score was evaluated at baseline, at 6th, and 12th week. Degree of pigment clearance was assessed by a blinded physician and the patients. Satisfaction score was rated by patients using visual analogue scale. Adverse events were also recorded. Twenty-eight patients completed the study. Both lasers showed significant improvement in mean luminance score from baseline ( p < 0.05 ). Likewise<PERSON>, there was no significant difference in pigment clearance between two lasers either assessed by physician or patients. However, patients ' satisfaction score was significantly higher with the picosecond laser ( p = 0.014 ). Adverse events and pain were not different between groups. Q-switched KTP<ORGANIZATION> 532-nm nanosecond laser and KTP<ORGANIZATION> 532-nm picosecond laser are safe and effective for treating solar lentigines in Asians<GPE>. Based on cost-effectiveness, Q-switched KTP<ORGANIZATION> 532-nm nanosecond laser remains the main treatment while KTP<ORGANIZATION> 532-nm picosecond laser can be considered as a treatment option.
