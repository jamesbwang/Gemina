 The aim of this study was to characterize the microstructure of two zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ( ZLS<ORGANIZATION> ) glass-ceramics and evaluate their mechanical properties before and after the crystallization firing process ( CFP<ORGANIZATION> ). Field<PERSON> emission-scanning electron microscope ( FE-SEM ) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDS<ORGANIZATION> ) analyses were performed for microstructural characterization. To evaluate the pattern of crystallization and the molecular composition of ZLS<ORGANIZATION> glass-ceramics, was used X-ray diffraction ( XRD<ORGANIZATION> ). Vickers hardness, fracture toughness by the indentation method, and biaxial flexural strength were also measured. One hundred and forty ceramic discs were produced ( diameter=12mm ; thickness=1.2mm ) and allocated among four groups ( n=30 ): Sfir, Sunf-ZLS Vita Suprinity ; and Cfir<PERSON> and Cunf-ZLS Celtra Duo<PERSON> ; fired and unfired, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed and Weibull<PERSON> failure probabilities were calculated. Cfir<PERSON> showed the highest characteristic strength ( 251.25MPa ) and hardness ( 693.333±10.85GPa ). Conversely, Sunf<PERSON> presented the lowest characteristic strength ( 106.95MPa ) and significantly lowest hardness ( 597.533±33.97GPa ). According to Weibull<GPE> analysis, Sunf<PERSON> had the highest structural reliability ( m=7.07 ), while Sfir<PERSON> presented the lowest ( m=5.38 ). The CFP<ORGANIZATION> was necessary to crystallize zirconia in the partially crystallized ZLS<ORGANIZATION> glass-ceramics. Sfir<PERSON> had a lower percentage of crystallized zirconia than did Cfir<PERSON>. Fractographic<PERSON> analyses showed that all failures initiated from an inherent critical defect in Sunf<GPE> and from processing defects in the remaining groups. The CFP<ORGANIZATION> had a direct influence on the flexural strength and microstructural characteristics of both ZLS<ORGANIZATION> materials.
