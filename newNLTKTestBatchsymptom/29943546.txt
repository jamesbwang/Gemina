 With the sequence of the vasoactive intestinal peptiepeptide ( VIP<ORGANIZATION> ) from humans and according to the condon bias of Pichia<GPE> pastoris, we designed PCR<ORGANIZATION> primers of VIP<ORGANIZATION> and obtained the sequence of VIP<ORGANIZATION> by SOE-PCR. Then VIP<ORGANIZATION> gene was cloned into Pichia<GPE> pastoris secretory expression vector and the cell secretary system GS115-pPICZÎ±A-vip was constructed. The recombinant strain was induced by methanol for 96 hours, and we collected the supernatant and identified the VIP<ORGANIZATION> by mass spectrometry. The molecular weight of VIP<ORGANIZATION> was consistent with theoretical molecular weight. The final result showed that the target peptide VIP<ORGANIZATION> was successfully expressed. The experimental investigations of agarose gel diffusion revealed that the recombinant expression modified VIP<ORGANIZATION> had relatively strong antibacterial activity to E. coli ATCC25922<ORGANIZATION> and S. aureus ATCC25923<ORGANIZATION>. The minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC<ORGANIZATION> ) of VIP<ORGANIZATION> to E. coli ATCC25922<ORGANIZATION> and S. aureus ATCC25923<ORGANIZATION> was 8 mmol/L and 16 mmol/L. Further cytotoxicity and hemolytic experiments indicated that recombinant VIP<ORGANIZATION> was non-toxic to normal cells NCM460<ORGANIZATION> and IPEC-J2, had little hemolysis activity to SD rat erythrocytes. Meanwhile, by transmission electron microscopy, we found that VIP<ORGANIZATION> mainly inhibited bacteria by disrupting the cell membrane. These experiments established a useful system for further studies, application and mass production of antimicrobial peptide VIP.
