 Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most common hereditary disorder in adults, but is under-recognized. In Spain<GPE>, the number of patients diagnosed with AATD<ORGANIZATION> is much lower than expected according to epidemiologic studies. The objectives of this study were to assess the frequency and determinants of testing serum α1-antitrypsin ( AAT<ORGANIZATION> ) levels in COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients, and to describe factors associated with testing. EPOCONSUL<ORGANIZATION> is a cross-sectional clinical audit, recruiting consecutive COPD<ORGANIZATION> cases over one year. The study evaluated serum AAT<ORGANIZATION> level determination in COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients and associations between individual, disease-related, and hospital characteristics. A total of 4,405 clinical records for COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients from 57 Spanish<GPE> hospitals were evaluated. Only 995 ( 22.5 % ) patients had serum AAT<ORGANIZATION> tested on some occasion. A number of patient characteristics ( being male [ OR 0.5, p < 0.001 ], ≤55 years old [ OR 2.38, p < 0.001 ], BMI≤21 kg/m2 [ OR 1.71, p < 0.001 ], FEV1<ORGANIZATION> ( % ) < 50 % [ OR 1.35, p < 0.001 ], chronic bronchitis [ OR 0.79, p < 0.001 ], Charlson<PERSON> index ≥ 3 [ OR 0.66, p < 0.001 ], or history or symptoms of asthma [ OR 1.32, p < 0.001 ] ), and management at a specialized COPD<ORGANIZATION> outpatient clinic [ OR 2.73, p < 0.001 ] were identified as factors independently associated with ever testing COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients for AATD<ORGANIZATION>. Overall, 114 COPD patients ( 11.5 % of those tested ) had AATD<ORGANIZATION>. Of them, 26 ( 22.8 % ) patients had severe deficiency. Patients with AATD<ORGANIZATION> were younger, with a low pack-year index, and were more likely to have emphysema ( p < 0.05 ). Testing of AAT<ORGANIZATION> blood levels in COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients treated at outpatient respiratory clinics in Spain<GPE> is infrequent. However, when tested, AATD<ORGANIZATION> ( based on the serum AAT<ORGANIZATION> levels ≤100 mg/dL ) is detected in one in five COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients. Efforts to optimize AATD<ORGANIZATION> case detection in COPD are needed.
