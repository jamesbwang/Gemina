 The bile acid receptors, farnesoid X receptor ( FXR<ORGANIZATION> ) and Takeda<PERSON> G-protein-coupled receptor 5 ( TGR5<ORGANIZATION> ), regulate multiple pathways, including glucose and lipid metabolism. In a rabbit model of high-fat diet ( HFD<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced metabolic syndrome, long-term treatment with the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 reduces visceral adipose tissue accumulation, hypercholesterolemia and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. INT-767 significantly improves the hallmarks of insulin resistance in visceral adipose tissue ( VAT<ORGANIZATION> ) and induces mitochondrial and brown fat-specific markers. VAT<ORGANIZATION> preadipocytes isolated from INT-767-treated rabbits, compared to preadipocytes from HFD<ORGANIZATION>, show increased mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression of brown adipogenesis markers. In addition, INT-767 induces improved mitochondrial ultrastructure and dynamic, reduced superoxide production and improved insulin signaling and lipid handling in preadipocytes. Both
