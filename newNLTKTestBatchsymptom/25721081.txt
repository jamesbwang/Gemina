 Heat<GPE> shock proteins ( HSPs<ORGANIZATION> ) are important factors in the response of cancer cells to thermo- and chemotherapy. Transient hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion ( HIPEC<ORGANIZATION> ) therapy results in the upregulation of HSP<ORGANIZATION> expression, which may compromise the efficacy of additional anticancer treatments. The aim of the present study was to monitor the kinetics of HSP<ORGANIZATION> expression in tumor cells and patients with gastric cancer following HIPEC<ORGANIZATION>. Thus,
