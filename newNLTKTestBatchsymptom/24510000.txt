 [ Purpose ] This study aimed to evaluate the effect of body weight support with an assistive device on predicted locomotive physical activity measured using triaxial accelerometers in healthy young subjects. [ Subjects and Methods<ORGANIZATION> ] Sixteen healthy subjects aged 21.9 Â± 1.1 years walked on a treadmill at speeds of 45 and 55 meters/min under 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % body weight support conditions. Predicted metabolic equivalents and number of steps were evaluated using triaxial accelerometers. Measured metabolic equivalents and number of steps were evaluated using a metabolic system and observers, respectively. Raw<PERSON> data of synthetic accelerations were also obtained. [ Results ] Predicted metabolic equivalents and number of steps and raw data of synthetic accelerations decreased with increasing amounts of body weight support. [ Conclusion<ORGANIZATION> ] These findings suggest that accelerometers may underestimate locomotive physical activity with increasing amounts of body weight support using assistive devices. Thus, it is important to consider the amount of body weight support when assessing physical activities in subjects using assistive devices for mobility.
