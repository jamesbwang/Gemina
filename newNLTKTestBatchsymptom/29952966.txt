 The purpose of our study was to determine accuracy of CT<ORGANIZATION> texture analysis ( CTTA<ORGANIZATION> ) for differentiating benign from malignant pulmonary nodules, and well-differentiated from poorly differentiated lung cancers, with histology as the standard of reference.In this IRB-approved study, 175 adult patients ( average age 66 Â± 12 years ; age range 27-89 years, male 82: female 93 ) who underwent a noncontrast chest CT examination prior to CT-guided biopsy of pulmonary nodules were included. There were 57 benign ( 24 tumors or tumor-like lesions ; 33 inflammatory conditions ) and 120 malignant ( 29 well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, 48 poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, and 43 squamous cell carcinomas ) diagnoses on pathology. CTTA<ORGANIZATION> was performed on the prebiopsy noncontrast CT images using a commercially available software ( TexRAD<ORGANIZATION> limited, UK<ORGANIZATION> ). The CTCA<ORGANIZATION> features analyzed included mean HU values, percent positive pixels ( PPP<ORGANIZATION> ), mean value of positive pixels ( MPP<ORGANIZATION> ), standard deviation ( SD ), normalized SD, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy.The ROC<ORGANIZATION> analyses showed that normalized SD [ AUC: 0.63, ( CI: 0.55-72 ), P<PERSON> = .003 ] had moderate accuracy for differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. For differentiating among well-differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors, the ROC<ORGANIZATION> analysis showed that except skewness all other parameters were statistically significant The AUC<ORGANIZATION> values of other CTTA<ORGANIZATION> parameters were: mean ( AUC<ORGANIZATION>: 0.73-0.76, P<PERSON> = .001- < .0001 ) .CT texture analyses can reliably predict well- and poorly differentiated lung malignancies. However, inflammatory lung lesions with tissue heterogeneity negatively affect the performance of CTTA<ORGANIZATION> when it comes to differentiation between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules.
