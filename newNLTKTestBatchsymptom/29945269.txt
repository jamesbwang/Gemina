 Morphea<GPE> and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus ( LSA<ORGANIZATION> ) are two diseases that show considerable clinical and histopathological similarity and have been known to coexist in the same patient. Whether the two conditions are different entities or part of the same spectrum has been a topic of debate. This article describes a very rare and interesting case of concomitant morphea and LSA<ORGANIZATION> in a 50-year-old female in the same plaque following intramuscular drug injection in the deltoid region of the right arm. The coexistence of morphea and LSA<ORGANIZATION> in the same lesion has rarely been reported, thus compelling us to report this case.
