 In recent years, second-line diabetes treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors ( DPP-4i ) increased with a corresponding decrease in thiazolidinediones ( TZDs<ORGANIZATION> ). Using hospitalization for heart failure ( HF ) as a positive control outcome, we explored the use of calendar time as an instrumental variable ( IV ) and compared this approach to an active comparator new-user study. We identified DPP-4i or TZD<ORGANIZATION> initiators after a 6-month washout using Medicare<ORGANIZATION> claims 2006-2013. The IV<ORGANIZATION> was defined as a binary variable comparing initiators during October 2010 to December 2013 ( postperiod ) versus January 2008 to May 2010 ( preperiod ). We examined IV strength and estimated risk differences ( RDs<ORGANIZATION> ) for HF using Kaplan-Meier curves, which were compared with propensity score ( PS ) -weighted RD<ORGANIZATION> for DPP-4i versus TZD<ORGANIZATION>. The IV<ORGANIZATION> compared 22 696 initiators ( 78 % DPP-4i ) in the postperiod versus 20 283 initiators ( 38 % DPP-4i ) in the preperiod, resulting in 40 % compliance. The active-comparator ( PS-weighted ) approach compared 26 198 DPP-4i and 18 842 TZD initiators. Covariate balance across IV<ORGANIZATION> levels was slightly better than across treatments ( standardized difference, 3 % vs 4.5 % ). The 1- and 2-year local average treatment effects of RD<ORGANIZATION> of HF<ORGANIZATION> per 100 patients in the `` compliers '' ( 95 % confidence intervals ) were -0.62 ( -0.99 to -0.25 ) and -0.88 ( -1.46 to -0.25 ). Corresponding PS-weighted results were -0.20 ( -0.33 to -0.05 ) and -0.18 ( -0.30 to 0.03 ). Both approaches indicated lesser risk of HF<ORGANIZATION> hospitalizations among DPP-4i vs TZD<ORGANIZATION> initiators. The magnitude of the estimated effects may differ due to differences in the target populations and assumptions. Calendar<PERSON> time can be leveraged as an IV when market dynamics lead to profound changes in treatments.
