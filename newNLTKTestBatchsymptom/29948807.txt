 The Chronic Care Model<ORGANIZATION> ( CCM<ORGANIZATION> ) has been endorsed by experts to reduce disparities in chronic disease outcomes but benefits may be slow to appear in low-income populations. To evaluate the effect of CCM<ORGANIZATION> implementation on systolic blood pressure ( SBP<ORGANIZATION> ) control in minority patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM ). Retrospective study from 2012 to 2016 in two primary care clinics with primarily uninsured, Hispanic patients. Four 2-year cohorts of patients aged 18-75 with DM<ORGANIZATION> and SBP<ORGANIZATION> â‰¥ 140 mmHg on HTN<ORGANIZATION> drugs in year 1 and SBP<ORGANIZATION> measured 1 year later in year 2. Implementation of CCM<ORGANIZATION> for DM in January 2014 involved: electronic medical record revision, a DM registry, hypertension ( HTN<ORGANIZATION> ) treatment protocol, team education, performance feedback, and case management. SBP<ORGANIZATION> < 140 mmHg in year 2. Of 2354 patients, the mean age was 56.2 ( SD 9.5 ), baseline SBP 153.8 ( SD 14.9 ) mmHg<ORGANIZATION>, and 79.8 % Hispanic. Last SBP<ORGANIZATION> < 140 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> was 58.4 % for cohort 1 ( 2012-2013 ) and 68.5 % for cohort 4 ( 2015-2016 ). Adjusted odds ratios ( AORs<ORGANIZATION> ) for SBP<ORGANIZATION> control versus cohort 1 were 1.35 ( 95 % CI 1.07, 1.69 ) for cohort 3 ( 2014-2015 ) and 2.13 ( 95 % CI 1.60, 2.80 ) for cohort 4. AORs for SBP<ORGANIZATION> control were reduced by 15 % per HTN<ORGANIZATION> drug at baseline ( P<PERSON> = 0.001 ), 9 % per HTN<ORGANIZATION> drug added at last SBP ( P<PERSON> = 0.024 ), and 22 % for multi-dose HTN<ORGANIZATION> drugs ( P<PERSON> = 0.004 ). Among patients with persistent elevated SBP<ORGANIZATION> and represented in multiple cohorts, AORs<ORGANIZATION> for control were still over 2-fold higher for cohort 4 versus cohort 1. After adopting the CCM<ORGANIZATION> for primarily Hispanic patients with DM<ORGANIZATION>, SBP<ORGANIZATION> control increased significantly despite treatment with fewer HTN<ORGANIZATION> drugs. Yet improvement took 3-4 years, suggesting that financial rewards for using the CCM<ORGANIZATION> to achieve improved clinical outcomes for low-income, minority patients may be delayed.
