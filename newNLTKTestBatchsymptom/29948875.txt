 The objectives of this study are to evaluate if robotic cystectomy demonstrates reduced complications, readmissions, and cost-to-patient compared to open approach 30-day post-operatively, and to identify predictors of complication, readmission, and cost-to-patient. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 249 patients who underwent open ( n = 149 ) or robotic ( n = 100 ) cystectomy from 2009 to 2015 at our institution. Outcomes included 30-day post-operative complication, readmission, and cost-to-patient charges. We used modified Clavien-Dindo/MSKCC classifications. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate associations to outcomes and to build predictive models. Patient<PERSON>, clinical, and surgical characteristics differed by open and robotic groups, respectively, only for estimated blood loss ( median: 600 versus 150 cc, p < 0.01 ), operative time ( mean: 6.19 versus 6.85 h, p < 0.01 ), and length of stay ( median: 7 versus 5 days, p < 0.01 ). Complication: frequency of patients with at least one 30-day complication was 85 % compared to 66 % ( p < 0.01 ). Minor gastrointestinal and bleeding complications were increased in the open group ( 50 % versus 41 %, p = 0.01 ; 52 % versus 11 %, p < 0.01, respectively ). Fifty<PERSON> percent of patients required blood transfusion in open compared to 11 % ( p < 0.01 ). Patients in the open group experienced more major complications ( 19 % versus 10 %, p = 0.04 ). Robotic<PERSON> approach was a predictor for fewer complications ( OR 0.44, 95 % CI 0.20-0.99, p = 0.049 ). Readmission: no significant difference in number of patients readmitted was found. Cost-to-patient: Robotic<PERSON> approach predicted an 18 % reduction in total cost-to-patient compared to open approach ( p < 0.01 ). Robotic<PERSON> cystectomy demonstrated reduced total cost-to-patient when taking into account all 30-day post-operative services with fewer complications compared to open cystectomy.
