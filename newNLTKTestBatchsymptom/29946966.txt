 To analyze the organ donation action in population-based neurointensive care of acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH<ORGANIZATION> ) and to seek factors that would improve the identification of potential organ donors ( PODs<ORGANIZATION> ) and increase the donor conversion rate ( DCR<ORGANIZATION> ) after aSAH<ORGANIZATION>. The Kuopio<ORGANIZATION> Intracranial Aneurysm Database, prospective since 1995, includes all aSAH patients admitted to the Kuopio University Hospital<ORGANIZATION> ( KUH<ORGANIZATION> ) from its defined Eastern Finnish<LOCATION> catchment population. We analyzed 769 consecutive acute aSAH<ORGANIZATION> patients from 2005 to 2015, including their data from the Finnish Transplantation Unit<ORGANIZATION> and the national clinical registries. We analyzed PODs<ORGANIZATION> vs. actual donors among the 145 ( 19 % ) aSAH<ORGANIZATION> patients who died within 14 days of admission. Finland<PERSON> had implemented the national presumed consent ( opt-out ) within the study period in the end of 2010. We retrospectively identified 83 ( 57 % ) PODs<ORGANIZATION> while only 49 ( 34 % ) had become actual donors ( total DCR 59 % ) ; the causes for non-donorship were 15/34 ( 44 % ) refusals of consent, 18/34 ( 53 % ) medical contraindications for donation, and 1/34 ( 3 % ) failure of recognition. In 2005-2010, there were 11 refusals by near relatives with DCR<ORGANIZATION> 52 % ( 29/56 ) and only three in 2011-2015 with DCR<ORGANIZATION> 74 % ( 20/27 ). Severe condition on admission ( Hunt<ORGANIZATION> and Hess<PERSON> grade IV or V ) independently associated with the eventual POD<ORGANIZATION> status. Nearly 20 % of all aSAH patients acutely admitted to neurointensive care from a defined catchment population died within 14 days, almost half from cardiopulmonary causes at a median age of 69 years. Of all aSAH patients, 11 % were considered as potential organ donors ( PODs<ORGANIZATION> ). Donor<PERSON> conversion rate ( DCR<ORGANIZATION> ) was increased from 52 to 74 % after the national presumed consent ( opt-out ). Implicitly, DCR<ORGANIZATION> among aSAH<ORGANIZATION> patients could be increased by admitting them to the intensive care regardless of dismal prognosis for the survival, along a dedicated organ donation program for the catchment population.
