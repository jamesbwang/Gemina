 Enteroviruses<GPE> ( EV ) 71 and coxsackievirus A ( CVA<ORGANIZATION> ) 16 are the most prevalent EV serotypes responsible for hand, foot and mouth disease ( HFMD<ORGANIZATION> ). Nevertheless, CVA6<ORGANIZATION> was found to be the leading cause of HFMD<ORGANIZATION> in the Nanjing area, of China<GPE> in 2013. This study aims to provide insights into the occurrence of the emergent recombinant CVA6<ORGANIZATION> through examination of the evolutionary history and the involved recombination events. The viral protein1 ( VP1<ORGANIZATION> ) and non-structural ( NS ) 2C and 3D of 28 Nanjing CVA6 strains were aligned, among which the full-length sequences of eight strains were further characterized. We revealed the co-existence of two recombinant forms ( RFs<ORGANIZATION> ), RF-A and RF-J, in the local area. RF-J is a novel RF<ORGANIZATION> group, comprising a proportion of local and Shanghai CVA6<PERSON> strains from 2013. The appearance of RF-J CVA6 strains was most likely the result of two recombination events, with the co-circulating CVA4<ORGANIZATION> and CVA8<ORGANIZATION> providing the regions beyond positions 4001~4045 and 4866~4873, respectively. Evolutionary history analysis showed that the VP1<ORGANIZATION> sequences of RF-J derived from RF-A, which was also probably the ancestor of several other RF groups. The 3D region of RF-J was closely related to CVA8<ORGANIZATION>. The point in time of emergence of the most recent common ancestor ( tMRCA<ORGANIZATION> ) of RF-J in China<GPE> was estimated to be around 2011 in both terms of VP1<ORGANIZATION> and 3D region. The emerging recombinant CVA6<ORGANIZATION> variants belong to a novel RF-J group which was most likely formed by at least two recombination events. Continued monitoring on the geographical distribution of various CVA6<ORGANIZATION> RFs is essential.
