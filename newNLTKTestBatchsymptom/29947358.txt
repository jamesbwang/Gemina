 To explore associations between quantitative sensory testing ( QST<ORGANIZATION> ) and pretreatment pain, physical, and psychological characteristics in women with breast cancer. 41 women with treatment-naive stage 0-III breast cancer at the University<ORGANIZATION> of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center<PERSON> in Ann Arbor<PERSON>. Participants<PERSON> completed self-report surveys and QST<ORGANIZATION> within the month before breast surgery. Pressure pain thresholds ( PPTs<ORGANIZATION> ) were measured bilaterally at each trapezius with a manual QST<ORGANIZATION> algometer. PPT values were split, yielding low, moderate, and high pain sensitivity subgroups. Subgroup self-reported characteristics were compared using Spearman<PERSON> 's correlation, chi-square, and one-way analysis of variance. Lower PPT<ORGANIZATION> ( higher sensitivity ) was associated with higher levels of pain interference and maladaptive pain cognitions. The high-sensitivity group reported higher pain severities, interference, and catastrophizing and lower belief in internal locus of pain control than the low-sensitivity group. Individualized interventions for maladaptive pain cognitions before surgery may reduce pain sensitivity and the severity of chronic pain developed after surgery.
