 In this article, based on literature review, we present an integrated description of heboidophrenia and pseudo-psychopathic schizophrenia. Both diagnostic constructs describe latent psychotic processes inextricably bound with psychopathic features. Although both have been described in different eras and research threads, they are that similar that we could not find divergences. We formulated operational criteria for clinical and research purpose. The recognition of this syndrome improves risk management, treatment, and legal decisions.
