 Breakdown of the alveolo-capillary wall is pathognomonic for Acute Lung Injury<PERSON> ( ALI<ORGANIZATION> ). Angiopoietins, vascular-specific growth factors, are linked to endothelial barrier dysfunction, and elevated Angiopoietin-2 ( ANG2<ORGANIZATION> ) levels are associated with poor outcome of ALI<ORGANIZATION> patients. Specialized immune cells, referred to as 'TIE2-expressing monocytes and macrophages ' ( TEM<ORGANIZATION> ), were shown to specifically respond to ANG2<ORGANIZATION> binding. However, their involvement in acute inflammatory processes is so far completely undescribed. Thus, our aim was to assess the dynamics of TEMs<ORGANIZATION> in a murine model of ALI<ORGANIZATION>. Intratracheal instillation of LPS<ORGANIZATION> induced a robust pulmonary pro-inflammatory response with endothelial barrier dysfunction and significantly enhanced ANG2<ORGANIZATION> expression. The percentage number of TEMs<ORGANIZATION>, assessed by FACS<ORGANIZATION> analysis, was more than trebled compared to controls, with TEM<ORGANIZATION> count in lungs reaching more than 40 % of all macrophages. Such distinct dynamic was absent in all other analyzed compartments ( alveolar space, spleen, blood ). Incubation of the monocytic cell line THP-1 with LPS<ORGANIZATION> or TNF-Î± resulted in a dose-dependent, significant upregulation of TIE2<ORGANIZATION>, suggesting that not recruitment from extra-pulmonary compartments but TIE2<ORGANIZATION> upregulation in resident macrophages accounts for increased lung TEM<ORGANIZATION> frequencies. For the first time, our data provide evidence that the activity of TEMs<ORGANIZATION> changes at sites of acute inflammation.
