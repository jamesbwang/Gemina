 Insomnia<GPE> often coexists with depression, and there is compelling evidence for a genetic component in the etiologies of both disorders. We genotyped an exonic variant, rs4290270, in tryptophan hydroxylase-2 ( TPH-2 ) gene to investigate its association with primary insomnia in Han Chinese<PERSON>, and further with depression symptoms in patients with primary insomnia. Retrospective cross-sectional study. This study included 152 patients with primary insomnia and 164 age- and gender-matched normal controls. Neuropsychological tests were performed. The genotype distributions of TPH-2 gene rs4290270 met the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both patients and controls ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). The allele and genotype distributions of this variant were comparable between patients and controls in all subjects and by genders ( all P > 0.05 ). The impact of rs4290270 on SDS<ORGANIZATION> score changes was statistically significant ( P=0.002 ), with carriers of A/A genotype having the highest self-rating depression scale ( SDS<ORGANIZATION> ) score ( mean ± standard deviation: 52.73±12.88 ), followed by A/T genotype ( 50.94±11.29, P=0.35 ) and T/T genotype ( 43.48±7.78, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ), and this impact was more obvious in women ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). Our findings indicate that TPH-2 gene rs4290270 may not be a susceptibility locus for primary insomnia in Han Chinese<PERSON>, but may be a marker of depressive symptoms, especially SDS<ORGANIZATION> score, in patients with primary insomnia.
