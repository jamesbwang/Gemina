 Precision medicine aims to tailor cancer therapies to target specific tumor-promoting aberrations. For tumors that lack actionable drivers, which occurs frequently in the clinic, extensive molecular characterization and pre-clinical drug efficacy studies will be required. A cell line maintained at low passage and a patient- derived xenograft model ( PDX<ORGANIZATION> ) were generated using a fresh biopsy from a patient with a poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary origin. Next-generation sequencing, high throughput signaling network analysis, and drug efficacy trials were then conducted to identify actionable targets for therapeutic intervention. No actionable mutations were identified after whole exome sequencing of the patient 's DNA<ORGANIZATION>. However, whole genome sequencing revealed amplification of the 3q and 5p chromosomal arms, that include the
