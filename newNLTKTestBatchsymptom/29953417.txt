 The microbiome is defined as the collective genomes of the microbes ( composed of bacteria, bacteriophage, fungi, protozoa and viruses ) that colonize the human body, and alterations have been associated with a number of disease states. Changes in gut commensals can influence the neurologic system via the brain-gut axis, and systemic insults such as trauma or traumatic brain injury ( TBI<ORGANIZATION> ) may alter the gut microbiome. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gut microbiome in a pre-clinical TBI<ORGANIZATION> cortical impact model. Male rats underwent craniotomy and randomized to a sham group ( n = 4 ), or a moderate TBI<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 10 ) using a pneumatic impactor. MRI<ORGANIZATION> and behavioral assessments were performed pre-TBI and on days 2, 7 and 14 days thereafter. Microbiome<PERSON> composition was determined with 16 s rRNA sequencing from fecal sample DNA<ORGANIZATION> pre-TBI and 2 hrs, 1, 3, and 7 days afterwards. Alpha- and β- bacterial diversity, as well as organizational taxonomic units ( OTUs<ORGANIZATION> ) were determined. Significant changes in the gut microbiome were evident as early as 2 hrs after TBI<ORGANIZATION> as compared to pre-injured samples and sham rats. While there were varying trends among the phylogenetic families across time, some changes persisted through 7 days in the absence of therapeutic intervention. While large structural lesions and behavioral deficits were apparent post-TBI, there were modest but significant decreases in α-diversity. Moreover, both changes in representative phyla and α-diversity measures were significantly correlated with MRI-determined lesion volume. These results suggest that changes in the microbiome may represent a novel biomarker to stage TBI<ORGANIZATION> severity and predict functional outcome.
