 Post-pericardiotomy syndrome ( PPS<ORGANIZATION> ) is an inflammatory process involving the pleura, pericardium, or both and occurs after cardiothoracic surgery. Surgical atrial septal defect ( ASD<ORGANIZATION> ) closure is associated with higher incidence of PPS<ORGANIZATION> post-operatively as compared to other operations. Reported incidence of PPS<ORGANIZATION> varies from 1 to 40 %. NSAIDs are often used to treat PPS<ORGANIZATION> and in our center, some practitioners have prescribed ibuprofen prophylactically. This study sought to investigate the impact of prophylactic treatment with ibuprofen on the development and severity of PPS<ORGANIZATION> following surgical ASD<ORGANIZATION> closure, with particular attention to secundum-type ASDs<ORGANIZATION>. We retrospectively reviewed clinical and operative data of all surgical ASD<ORGANIZATION> repairs in our center from 1/2007 to 7/2017. ASDs were grouped by subtype. PPS<ORGANIZATION> was considered positive if the primary cardiologist diagnosed and documented clinical signs of PPS<ORGANIZATION> on post-operative outpatient follow-up. Records were reviewed to confirm documented diagnosis of PPS<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 245 cases were reviewed with 207 having sufficient data. Median<GPE> age was 2 years ( range 4 months-27 years ), female 57 %. Overall incidence of PPS<ORGANIZATION> was 10 %. There was no difference in incidence of PPS<ORGANIZATION> in those prescribed ibuprofen as compared to those who were not. This was true for both the entire cohort and the subgroup analysis ( P<PERSON> = 1.0 ). Four patients overall required pericardiocentesis, none of whom received prophylactic ibuprofen. Prophylactic ibuprofen prescription following surgical ASD<ORGANIZATION> repair did not reduce the rate of PPS<ORGANIZATION> in our cohort.
