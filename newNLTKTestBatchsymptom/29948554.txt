 A â‰¥ 1-mm margin is standard for resection of colorectal liver metastases ( CLM<ORGANIZATION> ). However, R1<GPE> resection is not rare ( 10-30 % ), and chemotherapy could mitigate its impact. The possibility of detaching CLM<ORGANIZATION> from vessels ( R1 vascular margin ) has been described. A reappraisal of R1<GPE> resection is needed. A 19-question survey regarding R1 resection for CLM<ORGANIZATION> was sent to hepatobiliary surgeons worldwide. Seven clinical cases were included. In total, 276 surgeons from 52 countries completed the survey. Ninety<PERSON> percent reported a negative impact of R1<GPE> resection ( 74 % local recurrence, 31 % hepatic recurrence, and 36 % survival ), but 50 % considered it sometimes required for resectability. Ninety-one percent of responders suggested that the impact of R1<GPE> resection is modulated by the response to chemotherapy and/or CLM<ORGANIZATION> characteristics. Half<PERSON> considered the risk of R1<GPE> resection to be an indication for preoperative chemotherapy in patients who otherwise underwent upfront resection, and 40 % modified the chemotherapy regimen when the tumor response did not guarantee R0 resection. Nevertheless, 80 % scheduled R1 resection for multiple bilobar CLM that responded to chemotherapy. Forty-five percent considered the vascular margin equivalent to R0<GPE> resection. However, for lesions in contact with the right hepatic vein, right hepatectomy remained the standard. Detachment from the vein was rarely considered ( 10 % ), but 27 % considered detachment in the presence of multiple bilobar CLM<ORGANIZATION>. A negative margin is still standard for CLM<ORGANIZATION>, but R1 resection is no longer just a technical error. R1 resection should be part of the modern multidisciplinary, aggressive approach to CLM<ORGANIZATION>.
