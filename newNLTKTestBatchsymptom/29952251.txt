 Malignant<GPE> pleural effusion ( MPE<ORGANIZATION> ) affects more than 1 million people globally. There is a dearth of evidence on the therapeutic approach to MPE<ORGANIZATION>, and not surprisingly a high degree of variability in the management thereof. We aimed to provide practicing clinicians with an overview of the current evidence on the management of MPE<ORGANIZATION>, preferentially focusing on studies that report patient-related outcomes rather than pleurodesis alone, and to provide guidance on how to approach individual cases. A pleural intervention for MPE<ORGANIZATION> will perforce be palliative in nature. A therapeutic thoracentesis provides immediate relief for most. It can be repeated, especially in patients with a slow rate of recurrence and a short anticipated survival. Definitive interventions, individualized according the patient 's wishes, performance status, prognosis and other considerations ( including the ability of the lung to expand ) should be offered to the remainder of patients. Chemical<PERSON> pleurodesis ( achieved via intercostal drain or pleuroscopy ) and indwelling pleural catheter ( IPC<ORGANIZATION> ) have equal impact on patient-based outcomes, although patients treated with IPC<ORGANIZATION> spend less time in hospital and have less need for repeat pleural drainage interventions. Talc<PERSON> slurry via IPC<ORGANIZATION> is an attractive recently validated option for patients who do not have a nonexpandable lung.
