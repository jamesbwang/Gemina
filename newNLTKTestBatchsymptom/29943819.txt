 Diabetic<GPE> neuropathic pain is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ). Activation of satellite glial cells ( SGCs<ORGANIZATION> ) in the dorsal root ganglia ( DRG<ORGANIZATION> ) plays a crucial role in neuropathic pain through the release of proinflammatory cytokines. The P2Y12<GPE> receptor is expressed in SGCs<ORGANIZATION> of the DRG<ORGANIZATION>. In this study, our aim was to investigate the role of the P2Y12<GPE> receptor on the pathological changes in diabetic neuropathic pain. The present study showed that diabetic neuropathic pain increased mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in type 2 DM model rats. The results showed that the expression levels of P2Y12<GPE> messenger RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( mRNA<ORGANIZATION> ) and protein in DRG<ORGANIZATION> SGCs were increased in DM<GPE> model rats compared with control rats. Glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP<ORGANIZATION> ) and interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) expression levels in the DRG<ORGANIZATION> were increased in DM rats. Upregulation of GFAP<ORGANIZATION> is a marker of SGC<ORGANIZATION> activation. Targeting the P2Y12<GPE> receptor by short hairpin RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( shRNA<ORGANIZATION> ) decreased the upregulated expression of P2Y12<GPE> mRNA and protein, coexpression of P2Y12<GPE> and GFAP<ORGANIZATION>, the expression of GFAP<ORGANIZATION>, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 in the DRG<ORGANIZATION> of DM<ORGANIZATION> rats, and relieved mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in DM rats. After treatment with the P2Y12<GPE> receptor shRNA<ORGANIZATION>, the enhancing integrated OPTICAL<ORGANIZATION> density ( IOD<ORGANIZATION> ) ratios of p-P38 MAPK<ORGANIZATION> to P38<GPE> mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK<ORGANIZATION> ) in the DM<ORGANIZATION> rats treated with P2Y12<PERSON> shRNA<ORGANIZATION> were significantly lower than that in the untreated DM rats. Therefore, P2Y12<PERSON> shRNA treatment decreased SGC<ORGANIZATION> activation to relieve mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in DM rats.
