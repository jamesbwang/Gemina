 Peptide<GPE> receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT<ORGANIZATION> ) is in clinical use today to treat metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Infused radiolabeled somatostatin analogue peptides targets the tumors which are killed by irradiation damage. The peptides, however, are also retained in the kidneys due to glomerular filtration, and the administered doses must be limited to avoid kidney damage. The human radical scavenger and antioxidant Î±1-microglobulin ( A1M ) has previously been shown to protect bystander tissue against irradiation damage, and has pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties similar to somatostatin analogues. Here, we have investigated if A1M<PERSON> can be used as a renal protective agent in PRRT<GPE>. We describe nephroprotective effects of human recombinant A1M on the short- and long-term renal damage observed following 177Lu-DOTATATE ( 150 MBq ) exposure in BALB/c<GPE> mice. After 1, 4 and 8 days ( short term ), 177Lu-DOTATATE-injection resulted in increased formation of DNA<ORGANIZATION> double-strand breaks in the renal cortex, up-regulated expression of apoptosis and stress-response related genes, and proteinuria ( albumin in urine ), all of which were significantly suppressed by co-administration of A1M<GPE> ( 7 mg/kg ). After 6, 12 and 24 weeks ( long term ), 177Lu-DOTATATE-injection resulted in increased animal death, kidney lesions, glomerular loss, up-regulation of stress-genes, proteinuria, and plasma markers of reduced kidney function, all of which were suppressed by co-administration of A1M<GPE>. Innovation and conclusion: This study demonstrates that A1M<PERSON> effectively inhibits radiation-induced renal damage. The findings suggest that A1M<PERSON> may be used as a radioprotector during clinical PRRT<ORGANIZATION>, potentially facilitating improved tumor control and enabling more patients to receive treatment.
