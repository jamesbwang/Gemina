 The KBI<ORGANIZATION> ( kissing balloon inflation ) technique is considered the default strategy for the two-stent approach in real world practice. Studies comparing KBI<ORGANIZATION> and No-KBI in patients undergoing the one-stent approach have reported conflicting results. The meta-analysis was performed to compare the clinical outcomes of the KBI<ORGANIZATION> strategy and the No-KBI strategy for coronary bifurcation lesions in the one-stent approach. Five randomized studies were included, and a total of 1264 patients were involved in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome was cardiac death. The secondary end points were stent thrombosis, MI<GPE> ( myocardial infarction ), target lesion revascularization ( TLR<ORGANIZATION> ), target vessel revascularization ( TVR<ORGANIZATION> ), and main vessel and side branch restenosis. Compared with the No-KBI strategy, the KBI<ORGANIZATION> strategy was associated with a significant reduction in side branch restenosis ( OR: 0.44, 95 % CI: 0.30-0.64, p < 0.001 ). A high risk of main vessel restenosis was found in the KBI<ORGANIZATION> group ( OR: 2.96, 95 % CI: 1.74-5.01, p < 0.001 ). There were no significant differences in rates of cardiac death ( OR: 1.89, 95 % CI: 0.60-5.95, p = 0.28 ), stent thrombosis ( OR: 0.98, 95 % CI: 0.19-4.94, p = 0.98 ), MI<GPE> ( OR: 0.68, 95 % CI: 0.33-1.44, p = 0.30 ), TLR<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 1.14, 95 % CI 0.68-1.90, p = 0.62 ), or TVR<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 1.27, 95 % CI 0.75-2.16, p = 0.38 ). Compared with the No-KBI strategy, the KBI<ORGANIZATION> strategy reduced the incidence of side branch restenosis and increased the risk of main branch restenosis in the one-stent approach. However, the clinical outcomes were similar between the KBI<ORGANIZATION> and No-KBI groups.
