 In the treatment of metastatic breast cancer ( mBC<ORGANIZATION> ), regular monitoring is key in helping physicians to make informed clinical decisions, managing treatment side effects, and maintaining patients ' quality of life. Therefore, we investigated the monitoring frequency in post-menopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC stratified by first-line regimen. Treatment monitoring was assessed using two complementary data sources: a medical chart review ( chart review analysis ) and a commercial claims database ( claims analysis ). Women with post-menopausal HR+/HER2- mBC who initiated first-line therapy for mBC<ORGANIZATION> were selected and classified under three cohorts, based on treatment received: cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 ( CDK4/6 ) inhibitor ( i.e., palbociclib-the only CDK4/6 approved at the time of the study ), endocrine therapy ( ET ), and chemotherapy. Frequency of monitoring [ complete blood count ( CBC<ORGANIZATION> ), electrocardiogram ( EKG<ORGANIZATION> ), and liver function test ( LFT<ORGANIZATION> ) ] and laboratory abnormalities detected during the first line of therapy were analyzed. In the chart review analysis, 64 US<GPE> oncologists abstracted medical information on 401 eligible patients, including 210 CDK4/6 users, 121 ET users, 51 chemotherapy users ; 19 patients used other regimens. All patients had ≥ 1 CBC<ORGANIZATION> ; between 8.3 % ( ET<ORGANIZATION> users ) and 39.5 % ( CDK4/6 users ) had ≥ 1 EKG<ORGANIZATION> ; and over 98 % of patients had ≥ 1 LFT across all three cohorts. Among monitored patients, 64.6 % had a CBC<ORGANIZATION> abnormality, with anemia ( 39.9 % ), leukopenia ( 27.4 % ), and neutropenia ( 26.7 % ) being the most common. Abnormal EKG<PERSON> readings were detected in 8.4, 0.0 %, and 7.7 % of CDK4/6, ET<ORGANIZATION>, and chemotherapy users, respectively. LFT<ORGANIZATION> abnormalities were detected in 14.1-26.0 % of CDK4/6 and chemotherapy users, respectively. Similar<PERSON> frequency of monitoring was observed in the claims analysis, with the exception of EKG<ORGANIZATION> monitoring, for which the proportion of patients tested was higher. Post-menopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC receiving first-line therapy with CDK4/6, ET<ORGANIZATION>, or chemotherapy were regularly monitored regardless of the first-line regimen received.
