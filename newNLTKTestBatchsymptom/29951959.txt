 Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH<ORGANIZATION> ) is a devastating form of stroke, with a high rate of mortality and morbidity. Even with the best current medical or surgical interventions, outcomes remain poor. The location and initial hematoma volume are strong predictors of mortality. Hematoma<PERSON> expansion ( HE ) is a further marker of poor prognosis that may be at least partly preventable. Several risk factors for HE have been identified, including baseline ICH<ORGANIZATION> volume, anticoagulation, and computed tomography angiography spot signs. Recent studies have shown the correlation of serum calcium ( Ca
