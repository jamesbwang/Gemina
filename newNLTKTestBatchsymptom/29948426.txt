 The purpose of the study was to determine whether the GDF-15 is present in follicular fluid ; to evaluate if there is a relation between follicular and serum levels of GDF-15 and fertility status of study subjects ; and to test whether granulosa cells, oocytes, or both produce GDF-15. This study used follicular fluid ( FF<ORGANIZATION>, serum, and oocytes obtained under informed consent from women undergoing oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization. It also used ovaries from deceased preterm newborns. Collection of FF<ORGANIZATION> and blood at the time of oocyte retrieval, ELISA<ORGANIZATION> and western blot were performed to determine levels and forms of GDF-15. Concentrations of GDF-15 in FF and serum, its expression in ovarian tissue, and secretion from granulosa cells were analyzed. GDF-15 concentration in FF<ORGANIZATION> ranged from 35 to 572 ng/ml, as determined by ELISA<ORGANIZATION>. Western blot analysis revealed the GDF-15 pro-dimer only in FF. Both normal healthy and cancerous granulosa cells secreted GDF-15 into culture media. Primary oocytes displayed cytoplasmic GDF-15 positivity in immunostained newborn ovaries, and its expression was also observed in fully grown human oocytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documentation of cytokine GDF-15 presence in follicular fluid. Its concentration was not associated with donor/patient fertility status. Our data also show that GDF-15 is expressed and inducible in both normal healthy and cancerous granulosa cells, as well as in oocytes.
