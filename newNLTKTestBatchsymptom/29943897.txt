 It is unclear whether exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH<ORGANIZATION> ) affects lung function in children with asthma. Whether vitamin D insufficiency enhances any detrimental effects of PAH<ORGANIZATION> on lung function in asthmatic children is also unknown. Cross-sectional study of 2459 children ( 6-17 years ) who participated in the 2007-2012 National Health<ORGANIZATION> and Nutrition Examination Survey<ORGANIZATION>. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze the relation between molar mass of urinary PAH<ORGANIZATION> metabolites ( sum of all PAH ( ΣmolPAH<ORGANIZATION> ), sum of PAH<ORGANIZATION> with 2 benzene rings ( Σmol2-PAH ), or sum of PAH<ORGANIZATION> with 3 or 4 benzene rings ( Σmol3,4-PAH ) ) and lung function or exhaled fraction of nitric oxide ( FeNO<ORGANIZATION> ) in children with and without asthma. In this multivariable analysis, we tested whether vitamin D insufficiency ( a serum 25 ( OH ) D level < 30 ng/mL ) interacts with PAH<ORGANIZATION> exposure on lung function in children with asthma. Among children with asthma, higher ΣmolPAH<ORGANIZATION>, and Σmol2-PAH were significantly associated with decreased % predicted FEV1<ORGANIZATION> ( by 3.5-3.8 % ). Urinary PAH<ORGANIZATION> were not associated with lung function in children without asthma or with FeNO<ORGANIZATION>. Given a significant interaction between vitamin D insufficiency and PAH<ORGANIZATION> metabolites on lung function in asthmatic children, we stratified the analysis by vitamin D status. In this analysis, urinary PAH<ORGANIZATION> metabolites were significantly associated with 2.0-5.6 % reduced % predicted FEV1<ORGANIZATION> and % predicted FEV1/FVC in children with asthma and vitamin D insufficiency, but not in those with asthma and vitamin D sufficiency. Vitamin D<PERSON> insufficiency and PAH<ORGANIZATION> exposure may have synergistic detrimental effects on lung function in asthmatic children.
