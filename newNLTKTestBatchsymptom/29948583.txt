 In spite of several proposed predictors for premature ventricular complex ( PVC<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced cardiomyopathy ( PVC-CMP ), the specific ECG<ORGANIZATION> features of idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract ( RVOT<ORGANIZATION> ) PVC-CMP remain unknown. A total of 130 patients ( 49 males, mean age 44 years ) with symptomatic and drug-refractory idiopathic RVOT<ORGANIZATION> PVCs undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA<ORGANIZATION> ) were enrolled. The patients were categorized into two groups, including those with and without RVOT<ORGANIZATION> PVC-CMP ( left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF<ORGANIZATION> ) < 50 %, n = 25 and LVEF<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 50 %, n = 105, respectively ). The 12-lead PVC<ORGANIZATION> morphologies were assessed. Patients with RVOT<ORGANIZATION> PVC-CMP had a lower LVEF<ORGANIZATION> ( 42 ± 5 % vs. 60 ± 7 %, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) and higher PVC<ORGANIZATION> burden ( 24 ± 14 % vs. 15 ± 11 %, P<PERSON> = 0.02 ) when compared to patients without RVOT<ORGANIZATION> PVC-CMP. The PVC<ORGANIZATION> features in those with PVC-CMP<PERSON> displayed a significantly wider QRS<ORGANIZATION> duration ( 143 ± 14 ms vs. 132 ± 17 ms, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) and higher peak deflection index ( PDI<ORGANIZATION> ; 0.60 ± 0.07 vs. 0.55 ± 0.08, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the QRS<ORGANIZATION> duration ( odds ratio ( OR ) 1.130, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.020-1.253, P<PERSON> = 0.02 ) and PDI<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 1.240, 95 % CI 1.004-1.532, P<PERSON> = 0.04 ) were independently associated with RVOT<ORGANIZATION> PVC-CMP. Based on the receiver-operating characteristic analysis, a QRS<ORGANIZATION> duration > 139 ms and PDI<ORGANIZATION> > 0.57 could predict RVOT<ORGANIZATION> PVC-CMP ( area under the curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) 0.710 and AUC<ORGANIZATION> 0.690, respectively ). The elimination and suppression of PVCs<ORGANIZATION> by RFCA<ORGANIZATION> resulted in the recovery of the LVEF<ORGANIZATION> in RVOT<ORGANIZATION> PVC-CMP. The ECG<ORGANIZATION> parameters, including a wider QRS<ORGANIZATION> duration and higher PDI<ORGANIZATION>, could predict the development of RVOT<ORGANIZATION> PVC-CMP, which could be effectively treated by RFCA<ORGANIZATION>.
