 Polyelectrolyte<GPE> nanoparticle constructs ( NPs<ORGANIZATION> ) comprising salmon calcitonin ( sCT<ORGANIZATION> ), chitosan ( CS ), and hyaluronic acid ( HA ) were previously established as having anti-inflammatory potential when injected via the intra-articular ( i.a. ) route to a mouse model. We attempted to translate the formulation to a large animal model, the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION> ) -stimulated equine model of joint inflammation. The aim was to manufacture under aseptic conditions to produce sterile pyrogen-free NPs<ORGANIZATION>, to confirm physicochemical characteristics, and to test toxicity and efficacy in a pilot study. NP dispersions were successfully formulated using pharmaceutical-grade source materials and were aseptically manufactured under GMP-simulated conditions in a grade A modular aseptic processing workstation. The NP<ORGANIZATION> formulation had no detectable pathogen or endotoxin contamination. NPs were then tested versus a lactated Ringer<PERSON> 's solution control following single i.a. injections to the radiocarpal joints of two groups of four horses pre-treated with LPS<ORGANIZATION>, followed by arthrocentesis at set intervals over 1 week. There was no evidence of treatment-related toxicity over the period. While there were no differences between clinical read-outs of the NP<ORGANIZATION> and the control, two synovial fluid-derived biomarkers associated with cartilage turnover revealed a beneficial effect of NPs<ORGANIZATION>. In conclusion, NPs<ORGANIZATION> comprising well-known materials were manufactured for an equine i.a.-injectable pilot study and yielded no NP-attributable toxicity. Evidence of NP-associated benefit at the level of secondary endpoints was detected as a result of decreases in synovial fluid inflammatory biomarkers.
