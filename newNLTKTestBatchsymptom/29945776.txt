 Hypertension<GPE> is one of the chronic side effects of dexamethasone ( DEX<ORGANIZATION> ) treatment ; however, almost nothing is known about its acute effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible mechanisms involved in blood pressure control after acute or short-term DEX<ORGANIZATION> treatment in adult animals. Eighty Wistar<PERSON> rats were divided into four groups: C1 and C5<GPE>, for rats treated with saline for 1 or 5 days, respectively ; D1 and D5<GPE>, for rats treated with DEX<ORGANIZATION> for 1 or 5 days, respectively ( decadron, 1 mg/kg, i.p. ). Heart rate was increased in DEX<ORGANIZATION> treatment, but arterial pressure and cardiac muscle mass were not altered. Only few and isolated changes on gene expression and protein level of renin-angiotensin system components were observed. Five days of DEX<ORGANIZATION> treatment, but not one day, determined an increase in sympathetic component of spectral analysis ( +75.93 %, P<PERSON> < .05 ) and a significant reduction of parasympathetic component ( -18.02 %, P<PERSON> < .05 ), which contributed to the autonomic imbalance to the heart ( LF/HF, +863.69 % ). The results of this present study demonstrated, for the first time, that short-term exposure to DEX<ORGANIZATION> treatment impairs the autonomic balance to the heart before hypertension, which was independent of renin-angiotensin system.
