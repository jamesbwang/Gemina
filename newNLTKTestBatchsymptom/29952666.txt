 Hallux<GPE> valgus ( HV ) adversely affects quality of life. Patients frequently express concerns regarding postoperative foot appearance, foot width and footwear anticipations. However, only scarce data are available regarding postoperative foot width. Seventy-one cases with moderate to severe HV treated with scarf osteotomy were included. The average age was 55.7 years ( range, 20-76 ), with average follow-up of 20.7 months ( range, 6-96 ). Patients<PERSON> ' medical records were reviewed for demographic, operative, and radiographic data. Foot<PERSON> width was assessed radiographically by measuring both bone ( distance between the first and fifth metatarsal heads ) and soft tissue width ( maximal distance of the soft tissue outline ). Preoperative HV deformity ( mean hallux valgus angle [ HVA ] 35.8 degrees, intermetatarsal angle [ IMA<ORGANIZATION> ] 14.1 degrees, and distal metatarsal articular angle [ DMAA ] 15.2 degrees ) was successfully corrected ( postoperative mean HVA 13.7 degrees, IMA<ORGANIZATION> 6.9 degrees, and DMAA<ORGANIZATION> 7.7 degrees ). Overall bony foot width was reduced by 5 % and soft tissue foot width by 2 %. Further analysis showed that 13 feet ( 18.3 % ) had increased ( > 5 % ) bone width, 26 feet ( 36.6 % ) with no change ( ±5 % ), and 32 feet ( 45.1 % ) for which the width decreased ( > 5 % ) postoperatively. Angular<PERSON> deformity ( HVA<ORGANIZATION>, IMA<ORGANIZATION>, and DMAA<ORGANIZATION> ) showed low correlation with postsurgery foot width. HV surgery effect on foot width was very limited, overall reducing foot width by 2 %. Furthermore, in only about half of the patients, the postoperative foot width decreased, regardless of angular deformity magnitude. Patients with the widest feet had a decrease in foot width following surgery, whereas patients with the narrowest feet had an increase in foot width. Level III<PERSON>, comparative series.
