 Intravenous sedation ( IVS<ORGANIZATION> ) is commonly used to complete dental treatment for uncooperative pediatric patients. Propofol ( PRO<ORGANIZATION> ) is widely used for IVS<ORGANIZATION> because of its short context sensitive half-time and amnestic effect. However, administering PRO<ORGANIZATION> to patients who have a history of egg anaphylaxis is still somewhat controversial. The evidence that supports the potential risks for allergic reactions following PRO<ORGANIZATION> use in patients with egg allergies is limited with some anesthesiologists recommending against its use in these patients. Alternative drug regimens for procedural sedation in this population are therefore desirable. Dexmedetomidine<GPE> ( DEX<ORGANIZATION> ), a selective Î±-2 agonist, has antianxiety and sedative properties and has been widely used not only for procedural sedation with mild inhibitory effects on respiration but also during minor surgeries for its analgesic effect. In this paper, we describe the successful administration of a combination of DEX<ORGANIZATION> and low-dose midazolam ( MDZ<ORGANIZATION> ) for sedation in an uncooperative pediatric patient. Both DEX<ORGANIZATION> and MDZ<ORGANIZATION> have been reported as safe and useful sedatives for dental treatment, and their combination may provide a helpful option for IVS<ORGANIZATION> of pediatric patients for whom PRO<ORGANIZATION> is not preferred.
