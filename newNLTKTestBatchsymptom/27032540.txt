 Lactose<GPE> synthesis rate is an important factor in milk production and quality in mammals. Understanding the lactose synthesis mechanism is crucial for the improvement of milk quantity and quality. However, research on the temporal gene changes regarding lactose synthesis during the whole lactation is still limited. The objective of this study was to determine gene expression profiles related to lactose synthesis in sows during lactation, and further identify the critical steps or key factors in the lactose synthesis pathway. To determine the temporal change of factors related to lactose synthesis in sows, milk from eight multiparous Yorkshire<ORGANIZATION> sows ( parity 3 to 6 ) was collected at 0 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, day 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, and 21 after birth of the first piglet. Lactose<PERSON> content, prolactin and progesterone concentration, and gene or protein expression related to lactose synthesis were measured. The lactose yield increased gradually from D2<GPE> to D21<PERSON> and reached a maximum at D14<ORGANIZATION> ( 3-fold from D2<GPE> ) during lactation ( These novel findings suggest that the increased lactose synthesis in lactation was related to the coordinated upregulation of genes or enzymes in the lactose synthesis pathway, and glucose transportation ( GLUT1<ORGANIZATION> ) and lactose synthetase ( LALBA<ORGANIZATION> and B4GALT1<ORGANIZATION> ) might be the critical steps in the lactose synthesis pathway of sows during lactation.
