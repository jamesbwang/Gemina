 Unmutated ( UM ) immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region ( IgHV<ORGANIZATION> ) status or IgHV3-21 gene usage is associated with poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. Interestingly, IgHV3-21 is often co-expressed with light chain IgLV3-21, which is potentially able to trigger cell-autonomous BCR-mediated signaling. However, this light chain has never been characterized independently of the heavy chain IgHV3-21. We performed total RNA<ORGANIZATION> sequencing in 32 patients and investigated IgLV3-21 prognostic impact in terms of treatment-free ( TFS<ORGANIZATION> ) and overall ( OS ) survival in 3 other independent cohorts for a total of 813 patients. IgLV3-21 presence was tested by real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION> and confirmed by Sanger<PERSON> sequencing. Using total RNA<ORGANIZATION> sequencing to characterize 32 patients with high-risk CLL<ORGANIZATION>, we found a high frequency ( 28 % ) of IgLV3-21 rearrangements. Gene<PERSON> set enrichment analysis revealed that these patients express higher levels of genes responsible for ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation ( P & lt ; 0.0001 ) as well as MYC<ORGANIZATION> target genes ( P=0.0003 ). Patients with IgLV3-21 rearrangements displayed a significantly shorter TFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS<ORGANIZATION> ( P & lt ; 0.05 ), particularly in IgHV-mutated patients. In each of the 3 independent validation cohorts, we showed that IgLV3-21 rearrangements -similar to UM<ORGANIZATION> IgHV status- conferred poor prognosis compared to mutated IgHV<ORGANIZATION> ( P & lt ; 0.0001 ). Importantly, we confirmed by multivariate analysis that this was independent of IgHV<ORGANIZATION> mutational status or subset # 2 stereotyped receptor ( P & lt ; 0.0001 ). We have demonstrated for the first time that a light chain can impact CLL<ORGANIZATION> prognosis and that IgLV3-21 light chain usage defines a new subgroup of CLL<ORGANIZATION> patients with poor prognosis.
