 Gunshot<GPE> penetrating brain injury is common in military conflict area and in urban violence area, but similar incident in pediatric population is rarely reported. We reported three cases of gunshot penetrating brain injury in children. Two patients had a good recovery after surgery and no significant deficit on his neurologic function, the other patient was not having surgery due to the severity of the condition. We suggest surgery should be performed immediately to prevent further injury and refractory brain edema due to the injury, in any case of penetrating brain injury ; a good prognosis can be achieved from early surgery and with appropriate post-operative treatment.
