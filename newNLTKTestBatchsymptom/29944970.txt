 Ovarian<GPE> ependymomas are rare glial neoplasms that typically occur in females on their 3rd to 4th decade of life. They are histologically similar to ependymomas of the central nervous system ( CNS<ORGANIZATION> ) but may have a broader immunophenotype. We describe a 27year old female who presented to the emergency room with a 3week history of cough and shortness of breath. Further<PERSON> workup disclosed a left pelvic mass and extensive intra-abdominal metastases. Pathology<PERSON> revealed sheets of monomorphic cells within a fibrillary stroma, papillary projections, true ependymal rosettes, and pseudorosettes consistent with an ependymoma of ovarian origin. Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS<ORGANIZATION> ) showed ATRX<ORGANIZATION> and NF2<ORGANIZATION> copy number losses. Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH<ORGANIZATION> ) for EWSR1<ORGANIZATION> demonstrated monosomy of 22q in greater than 90 % of cells. These molecular alterations have not been previously reported in ovarian or extra-CNS ependymomas.
