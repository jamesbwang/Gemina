 We describe the implementation and impact of a province-wide program of knowledge exchange ( KE ), aimed at developing capacity for the treatment of people with eating disorders ( EDs<ORGANIZATION> ). The program is designed to equip clinicians working in nonspecialized health-care installations with skills to evaluate and treat people with EDs<ORGANIZATION>. Trainings were conducted at 21 institutions. The majority of clinicians reported satisfaction with the KE<ORGANIZATION> program and indicated that the trainings enhanced their confidence and ability to treat patients with EDs<ORGANIZATION>. A subset of clinicians received case supervision with a specialist ED therapist and followed patients with EDs<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 119 ). Treated patients showed significant improvements on eating and depressive symptoms, and reported satisfaction with the treatments they received.
