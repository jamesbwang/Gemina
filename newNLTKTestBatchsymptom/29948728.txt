 The aim of the study was to elucidate the therapeutic effects of Cytisine<GPE> ( CYT<ORGANIZATION> ) on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Male ICR<PERSON> mice were pretreated with reagents ( drug ), and then subjected to 2 h focal cerebral ischemia and 24 h reperfusion. Morphologically, the histopathological impairment were estimated by the TTC<ORGANIZATION>, HE and TUNEL<ORGANIZATION> staining. The expression of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor, phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases, total ERK<ORGANIZATION>, phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein and total CREB<ORGANIZATION> were determined by immunofluorescence and Western<GPE> blot assay, respectively. The mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression of NR2B<ORGANIZATION>, ERK<ORGANIZATION> and CREB<ORGANIZATION> were quantified by the real-time RT-PCR. CYT significantly diminished the infarct size and neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, it ameliorated histopathological lesion dramatically. CYT<ORGANIZATION> promoted the phosphorylation of ERK<ORGANIZATION>, CREB<ORGANIZATION> and their mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression. In contrast, the expression of NR2B<ORGANIZATION> was suppressed in concomitant with the down-regulation of genes. The overall results thus far suggest that CYT<ORGANIZATION> confers the neuroprotection against cerebral I/R injury by regulating the NR2B-ERK/CREB signal pathway.
