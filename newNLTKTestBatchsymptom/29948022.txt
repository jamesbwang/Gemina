 The aim of the OCTO<ORGANIZATION> clinical study was to measure patients ' adherence to capecitabine-based treatment. A cohort of ambulatory patients treated with capecitabine monotherapy for either locally advanced or metastatic, breast or colorectal cancer was monitored for 6 cycles. Adherence<PERSON> was assessed in all patients by self-completed questionnaires on disease, pill-count and pharmacological dosage of FBAL<ORGANIZATION> ( metabolite of capecitabine ) ; and in half of the cohort by electronic medication event monitoring systems ( MEMS™ ) recording the opening times of the device. Forty patients were enrolled between November 2008 and September 2011 and treated by capecitabine for an average of 4.75 cycles ( range 1-6 ). Hand-foot syndrome ( HFS<ORGANIZATION> ) was the most frequently reported toxicity ( 35 % patients ), and to a lesser extent fatigue and/or asthenia ( 21 % ), nausea and/or vomiting ( 13 % ) and diarrhea ( 11 % ). In the MEMS™ cohort, 20 patients were included. Patients<PERSON> ' adherence was excellent with very few missing occasions ( 23/2272 records ). Close analysis of MEMS™ data revealed unexpected medication patterns, such as patients taking extra days of medication beyond planned cycle, patients taking extra doses per day and patients missing a day of dosing and `` compensating '' by taking extra the following day ( N = 7, 18 % ). A trend was found between over-adherence and high-grade toxicity ( grades 3 and/or 4 ): OR 4.74 [ 0.65-45.2 ], p = 0.13 and higher AUC<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.16 ). There was a trend towards increased AUC<ORGANIZATION> of FBAL<ORGANIZATION> in over-adherent patients ( p = 0.16 ). Adherence to oral anticancer chemotherapy was found excellent in this population suggesting over-adherence to capecitabine and potential safety implications for outpatients ' drugs.
