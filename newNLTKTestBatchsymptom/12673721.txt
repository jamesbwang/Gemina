 Melanoma<GPE> is one of the most aggressive malignant skin tumors and its incidence has been increasing worldwide in recent decades. Among the four subtypes, acral lentiginous melanoma ( ALM<ORGANIZATION> ) shows the highest incidence in Asian<GPE> countries, whereas ALM<ORGANIZATION> comprises only 1 % of all melanomas in white populations. Early clinical diagnosis of ALM<ORGANIZATION> is essential, but early ALM<ORGANIZATION> lesions are often difficult to diagnose because the pigmentation of the lesions sometimes follows the skin marking of the palms and soles, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance and an irregular border in both ALM<ORGANIZATION> and benign melanocytic nevus. To overcome this difficulty, dermoscopy was introduced, and determination of the patterns by this method is essential for accurate clinical diagnosis of ALM<ORGANIZATION>. Although recent clinical trials have demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors showed significantly improved overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma, ALM<ORGANIZATION> may be less susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors because of the poor immune response to the tumor. Therefore, strategies for enhancing the immune response to the tumor cells may be required when we apply immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced ALM<ORGANIZATION>. In this context, imiquimod, dacarbazine, or interferon are possible therapies that may enhance the effectiveness of the immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to being known to have poor immunogenicity, ALM<ORGANIZATION> is also known to have infrequent BRAF<ORGANIZATION> mutation. Therefore, the majority of ALM<ORGANIZATION> patients may not benefit from therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. However, some ALMs have mutations such as KIT<ORGANIZATION> and NRAS<ORGANIZATION> mutations, and therefore, targeted therapies may improve the survival of ALM<ORGANIZATION> patients in the future.
