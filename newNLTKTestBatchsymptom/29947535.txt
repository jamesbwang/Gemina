 Renal medullary endothelin B receptors ( ET<ORGANIZATION> ( B ) ) mediate sodium excretion and blood pressure ( BP ) control. Several animal models of hypertension have impaired renal medullary ET ( B ) function. We found that 4-week high-caloric diet elevated systolic BP in Dahl<GPE> salt-sensitive ( Dahl<ORGANIZATION> S ) rats ( 126+/-2 vs. 143+/-3 mm Hg, p < 0.05 ). We hypothesized that renal medullary ET ( B ) function is dysfunctional in DS rats fed a high-caloric diet. We compared the diuretic and natriuretic response to intramedullary infusion of ET<GPE> ( B ) agonist sarafotoxin 6c ( S6c<ORGANIZATION> ) in DS rats fed either a normal or high-caloric diet for 4 weeks. Urine<PERSON> was collected during intramedullary infusion of saline for baseline collection followed by intramedullary infusion of either saline or S6c<ORGANIZATION>. We first examined the ET<ORGANIZATION> ( B ) function in DS rats fed a normal diet. S6c<ORGANIZATION> increased urine flow ( 2.7+/-0.3 microl/min during baseline vs. 5.1+/-0.6 microl/min after S6c<ORGANIZATION> ; p < 0.05 ; n=5 ) and sodium excretion ( 0.28+/-0.05 vs. 0.81+/-0.17 micromol/min ; p < 0.05 ), suggesting that DS<ORGANIZATION> rats have renal medullary ET ( B ) function. However, DS<ORGANIZATION> rats fed a high-caloric diet displayed a significant increase in urine flow ( 2.7+/-0.4 vs. 4.2+/-0.4 microl/min, baseline vs. S6c<ORGANIZATION> infusion, respectively ; p < 0.05, n=6 ), but no significant change in sodium excretion in response to S6c<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.32+/-0.06 vs. 0.45+/-0.10 micromol/min ). These data demonstrate that renal medullary ET ( B ) function is impaired in DS rats fed a high-caloric diet, which may be contributed to the elevation of blood pressure during high-caloric feeding in this model.
