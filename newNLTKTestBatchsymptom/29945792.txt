 A brief period of aphasia is an extremely rare and likely underreported adverse effect of electroconvulsive therapy. Clinical<PERSON> studies that have described this phenomenon are scarce and its prevalence is unknown. We present a unique case of a 35-year old woman, who underwent an outpatient ECT<ORGANIZATION> session at our department, followed by a short span of aphasic symptoms, the extent of which were monitored clinically and via the czech version of the Minnesota<ORGANIZATION> aphasia screening test.
