 The immune suppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA<ORGANIZATION> ) and tacrolimus ( FK506<ORGANIZATION> ) are used worldwide in transplantation medicine to suppress graft rejection. Both CsA<ORGANIZATION> and FK506<ORGANIZATION> inhibit the phosphatase calcineurin ( CN ) whose activity controls the immune receptor-mediated activation of lymphocytes. Downstream targets of CN in lymphocytes are the nuclear factors of activated T cells ( NFATs<ORGANIZATION> ). We show here that the activity of NFATc1<ORGANIZATION>, the most prominent NFAT<ORGANIZATION> factor in activated lymphocytes supports the acute rejection of heterotopic heart allografts. While ablation of NFATc1<ORGANIZATION> in T<GPE> cells prevented graft rejection, ectopic expression of inducible NFATc1/Î±A isoform led to rejection of heart allografts in recipient mice. Acceptance of transplanted hearts in mice bearing NFATc1-deficient T cells was accompanied by a reduction in number and cytotoxicity of graft infiltrating cells. In CD8<ORGANIZATION>
