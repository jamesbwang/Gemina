 The crucial role of the median preoptic nucleus ( MnPO<ORGANIZATION> ) in the maintenance of hydroelectrolytic balance and autonomic regulation have been highlighted. Recently, the participation of the MnPO<ORGANIZATION> in the control of sympathetic nerve activity was demonstrated in essential hypertension model. However, peculiarities on the neurochemical changes underlying the differential role of MnPO<ORGANIZATION> during hypertension remain to be clarified. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the main excitatory pathways that modulate MnPO<ORGANIZATION> neurons in hypertensive rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR<ORGANIZATION> ) and rats submitted previously to the Goldblatt<ORGANIZATION> protocol ( two kidneys ; one clip ; 2K1C ) were used. Rats of both groups ( 250 to 350 g, n = 6 ) were anesthetized with urethane ( 1.2 g/kg, i.v. ) and instrumented to record mean arterial pressure ( MAP<ORGANIZATION> ), heart rate ( HR ) and renal sympathetic nerve activity ( RSNA<ORGANIZATION> ). Nanoinjection ( 100 nl ) of saline ( NaCl<ORGANIZATION>, 150 mM ), losartan ( AT1<ORGANIZATION> receptor antagonist ; 10 mM ) and kynurenic acid ( glutamate receptor antagonist ; 50 mM ) into the MnPO<ORGANIZATION> were performed. In 2K1C rats, glutamatergic blockade promoted decreases in MAP<ORGANIZATION> and RSNA<ORGANIZATION> ( -19.1 ± 0.9 mmHg, -21.6 ± 2.8 %, p < 0.05 ) when compared to saline ( -0.4 ± 0.6 mmHg, 0.2 ± 0.7 %, p < 0.05 ). Angiotensinergic inhibition also reduced these parameters ( -11.5 ± 1.2 mmHg, -10.5 ± 1.0 %, p < 0.05 ) in 2K1C. In SHR<ORGANIZATION>, Kynurenic<GPE> acid nanoinjections produced hypotension and sympathoinhibition ( -21.0 ± 2.5 mmHg, -24.7 ± 2.4 %, p < 0.05 ), as well losartan nanoinjections ( -9.7 ± 1.2 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> ; p < 0.05 ) and RSNA<ORGANIZATION> ( -12.0 ± 2.4 %, p < 0.05 ). These findings support the conclusion that a tonic excitatory neurotransmission exerted by angiotensin II, and mostly by glutamate in the MnPO<ORGANIZATION> could participate in the modulation of blood pressure and RSNA<ORGANIZATION> that independent on whether hypertension is primarily neurogenic or is secondary to stenosis in renal artery.
