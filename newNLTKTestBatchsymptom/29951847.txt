 To evaluate signal changes in the hippocampus of epileptic seizure rat models, based on quantified creatine chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CrCEST<ORGANIZATION> ) signals. CEST<ORGANIZATION> data and Measured CrCEST<PERSON> signals were exhibited significant differences between before and after KA<ORGANIZATION> injection in the ES<ORGANIZATION> group. At each time point, CrCEST<ORGANIZATION> signals showed significant correlations with PCr<ORGANIZATION> concentration ( all |r| > 0.59 ; all P < 0.05 ) ; no significant correlations were found between CrCEST<ORGANIZATION> signals and tCr<ORGANIZATION> concentrations ( all |r| < 0.22 ; all P > 0.05 ). CrCEST can adequately detect changes in the concentration of Cr as a result of energy metabolism, and may serve as a potentially useful tool for diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in epilepsy.
