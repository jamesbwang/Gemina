 to analyze the use of the Adductor Pollicis Muscle<ORGANIZATION> Thickness ( APMT<ORGANIZATION> ) as an anthropometric parameter and prognostic indicator in hospitalized or ambulatory patients. systematic review carried out the Web of Science<GPE>, SCOPUS<ORGANIZATION> and Lilacs<ORGANIZATION> databases. Twenty-three studies were performed on critical, surgical, oncological, nephropathic and hepatopathic patients, collecting data on bibliographic reference, study site, objectives, number of patients, age group, methodology, main results and conclusion. APMT<ORGANIZATION> proved to be a good anthropometric parameter for evaluation of nutritional status in critical patients without edema, and surgical, oncological and nephropathic patients, but presented poor performance for diagnosis of malnutrition in hepatopathic patients. It was a good prognostic indicator for mortality in critical, nephropathic and oncological patients, and also a good predictor of hospitalization in nephropathic patients. There was an association with neurological complications in Hepatic<GPE> Encephalopathy ( HE ) in the case of hepatophatic patients, but it was not a predictor of postoperative complications in surgical patients. APTM<ORGANIZATION> was considered a good anthropometric parameter in most clinical conditions, except in patients with liver disease and a good prognostic indicator for mortality in critical, oncological and nephropathic patients, and a predictor of neurological complications in HE. Further<PERSON> prognostic investigation, standardization of cutoff points and evaluation of sensitivity and specificity are required.
