 The number of cancer survivors is exponentially increasing worldwide, due to both advances in cancer detection and treatment strategies, as well as the aging and growth of the population. This decrease in cancer mortality has brought forth a concurrent increase of non-ischemic ( toxic ) dilated cardiomyopathy in the survivor population, also known as cancer therapeutics-induced cardiomyopathy ( CTIC<ORGANIZATION> ). The optimal pharmacological management for this condition is still elusive, and hence, the focus of this work. Our review of the literature did not identify any prospective randomized clinical trial of CTIC<ORGANIZATION> in adult cancer survivors, neither published nor in progress. However, available data seem to suggest that, when managed with standard guideline-derived medical therapy, the outcomes of CTIC<ORGANIZATION> are comparable to that of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ( IDC<ORGANIZATION> ). Nonetheless, the evidence behind this strategy is inadequate. Until new information becomes available, pharmacological management of CTIC<ORGANIZATION> must parallel that of IDC<ORGANIZATION>. However, implementation of such may be hindered by other cancer therapeutics-induced comorbidities and conditioned by the particular effects of heart failure pharmacotherapy on cancer outcomes. This work succinctly reviews these three areas, in the context of adult cancer survivors.
