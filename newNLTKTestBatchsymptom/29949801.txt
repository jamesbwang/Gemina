 High<GPE> baseline YKL-40 serum levels are associated with drug resistance in several solid tumours. However, their role in predicting docetaxel ( DOC<ORGANIZATION> ) resistance in prostate cancer ( PCa<ORGANIZATION> ) is unknown. Pre-treatment serum levels of YKL-40 and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA<ORGANIZATION> ) were analyzed in 109 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who underwent DOC-therapy. Responsive patients were retreated by repeated series of DOC<ORGANIZATION>. Results were compared with the clinical parameters as well as overall ( OS ) and disease-specific survival ( DSS<ORGANIZATION> ). YKL-40 but not PSA<ORGANIZATION> serum levels were significantly higher in patients with baseline resistance to DOC<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.035 ). Higher YKL-40 and PSA<ORGANIZATION> levels were detected in patients with bone metastasis ( p = 0.032 ; p = 0.010 ) and in those who were not pre-treated with radical prostatectomy ( p = 0.011, p = 0.008 ). High YKL-40 levels were associated with shorter OS ( p = 0.037 ) and DSS<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.017 ) in patients who received DOC<ORGANIZATION> in the first-line setting. In multivariable analysis, ECOG<ORGANIZATION> performance status ( p = 0.009 ), presence of any metastases ( p = 0.016 ) and high PSA<ORGANIZATION> levels ( p = 0.005 ) remained independent predictors for DSS<ORGANIZATION>. YKL-40 may help to identify patients with baseline resistance to DOC<ORGANIZATION> and therefore may help to optimize treatment decisions. In accordance, high pre-treatment YKL-40 serum levels were associated with shorter OS and DSS<ORGANIZATION> in patients who received DOC<ORGANIZATION> as first-line therapy.
