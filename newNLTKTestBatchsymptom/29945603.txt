 Although positive psychology interventions ( PPIs<ORGANIZATION> ) show beneficial effects on mental health in non-clinical populations, the current literature is inconclusive regarding its effectiveness in clinical settings. We aimed to examine the effects of PPIs<ORGANIZATION> on well-being ( primary outcome ), depression, anxiety, and stress ( secondary outcomes ) in clinical samples with psychiatric or somatic disorders. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA<ORGANIZATION> guidelines. PsycINFO<ORGANIZATION>, PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, and Scopus<PERSON> were searched for controlled studies of PPIs<ORGANIZATION> in clinical samples between Jan 1, 1998 and May 31, 2017. Methodological<ORGANIZATION> quality of each study was rated. We used Hedges<PERSON> ' adjusted g to calculate effect sizes and pooled results using random-effect models. Thirty studies were included, representing 1864 patients with clinical disorders. At post-intervention, PPIs<ORGANIZATION> showed significant, small effect sizes for well-being ( Hedges<PERSON> ' g = 0.24 ) and depression ( g = 0.23 ) compared to control conditions when omitting outliers. Significant moderate improvements were observed for anxiety ( g = 0.36 ). Effect sizes for stress were not significant. Follow-up effects ( 8-12 weeks ), when available, yielded similar effect sizes. Quality of the studies was low to moderate. These findings indicate that PPIs<ORGANIZATION>, wherein the focus is on eliciting positive feelings, cognitions or behaviors, not only have the potential to improve well-being, but can also reduce distress in populations with clinical disorders. Given the growing interest for PPIs<ORGANIZATION> in clinical settings, more high quality research is warranted as to determine the effectiveness of PPIs<ORGANIZATION> in clinical samples.
