 It has been supposed that endocrine disturbances might be responsible for PCOS-associated oxidative stress, with special emphasis on hyperandrogenism.Considering potential relationship between hyperandrogenism and increased free radicals production, parameters of oxidative stress were determined in non-obese normoinsulinemic adolescent girls newly diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS<ORGANIZATION> ). Nitrotyrosine<PERSON>, thiol groups ' concentrations, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities were determined under fasting conditions and during oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT<ORGANIZATION> ) in 35 PCOS<ORGANIZATION> patients and 17 controls. Insulin<PERSON> resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model ( HOMA-IR ), HOMA<ORGANIZATION> Î², IGI<ORGANIZATION>, Matsuda<PERSON> insulin sensitivity index ( ISI<ORGANIZATION> ) and AUC<ORGANIZATION> for glucose. Glutathione S-transferases ( GSTs<ORGANIZATION> ) polymorphisms were determined by PCR<ORGANIZATION>. Under fasting conditions, no significant difference of oxidative stress parameters was found between PCOS<ORGANIZATION> and controls. Acute<PERSON> hyperglycemia during OGTT<ORGANIZATION> induced significant alteration in parameters of oxidative protein damage in PCOS<ORGANIZATION> patients. Alteration in nitrotyrosine concentrations correlated with testosterone, DHEAS<ORGANIZATION>, androstenediones, FAI<ORGANIZATION> and LH<ORGANIZATION>, while change in thiol groups correlated with DHEAS<ORGANIZATION>. Significant inverse association was found between LH<ORGANIZATION> and ISI<ORGANIZATION>, as well as AUC<ORGANIZATION> glucose and thiol groups. PCOS<ORGANIZATION> girls, carriers of GSTM1-null genotype had significantly lower testosterone in comparison to ones with GSTM1-active genotype. PCOS<ORGANIZATION> girls exhibited high free radicals production together with unchanged antioxidant enzymatic capacity, independently from obesity and insulin resistance. Based on associations between oxidative stress parameters and testosterone, DHEAS<ORGANIZATION> and androstenedione, it can be suggested that increased free radicals production, probably as a consequence of hyperandrogenemia is an early event in the development of PCOS<ORGANIZATION>.
