 Children<GPE> with primary hypertension have been reported to have diminished scores in measures of cognition. However, little is known about the relative correlation between office and ambulatory blood pressure ( BP ) and neurocognitive test performance, and whether short-term BP variability is associated with decreased neurocognitive function. We sought to determine whether ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM<ORGANIZATION> ) was more strongly associated with neurocognitive test performance compared with office BP, and whether increased short-term BP variability was associated with lower neurocognitive scores. Seventy-five subjects ages 10-18 years, with untreated primary hypertension, and 75 matched normotensive controls completed neurocognitive testing. All subjects had office BP and ABPM<ORGANIZATION> prior to neurocognitive testing. On multivariate analyses, there was no significant association between office BP and neurocognitive tests. However, several ABPM<ORGANIZATION> parameters were significantly associated with neurocognitive test scores in the lower quartile, in particular 24 h SBP<ORGANIZATION> load and wake systolic blood pressure ( SBP<ORGANIZATION> ) index [ Rey Auditory Verbal learning Test<GPE> ( RAVLT<ORGANIZATION> ) List A Trial 1, 24 h SBP<ORGANIZATION> load, odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.02, wake SBP<ORGANIZATION> index, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.06 ; List A Total, 24 h SBP<ORGANIZATION> load, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.02, wake SBP<ORGANIZATION> index, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.06 ; Short Delay Recall<PERSON>, wake SBP<ORGANIZATION> index, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.06 ; CogState Maze<ORGANIZATION> delayed recall, 24 h SBP<ORGANIZATION> load, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.03, wake SBP<ORGANIZATION> index, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.08 ; Grooved Pegboard<PERSON>, 24 h SBP<ORGANIZATION> load, OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.02 ; all p < 0.05 ]. In contrast, short-term BP variability measures were not associated with neurocognitive test performance. ABPM<ORGANIZATION> is superior to office BP in distinguishing hypertensive youth with lower neurocognitive test performance.
