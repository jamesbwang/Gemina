 To determine the iron intake and status of infants following a version of baby-led weaning ( BLW<ORGANIZATION> ) modified to prevent iron deficiency ( Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS<GPE> ; BLISS<GPE> ) compared with those of infants following traditional spoon-feeding. This randomised controlled trial included 206 participants assigned to control ( n=101 ) or BLISS<GPE> ( n=105 ) groups. Both groups received standard midwifery and 'Well Child ' care. BLISS<ORGANIZATION> participants received eight additional visits ( from before birth to 9 months ) providing education and support on the BLISS<ORGANIZATION> approach to complementary feeding ( ie, BLW<ORGANIZATION> modified to increase iron intake ). The primary outcome of the BLISS<ORGANIZATION> study ( growth ) has been previously reported. This paper reports the key prespecified secondary outcomes, iron intake and iron status. Intake of iron and key absorption modifiers were assessed using weighed 3-day diet records at 7 and 12 months. A venipuncture blood sample was collected at 12 months to determine plasma ferritin, haemoglobin, soluble transferrin receptor, C-reactive protein and α Differences in median dietary iron intakes between the control and BLISS<ORGANIZATION> groups were not significant at 7 ( difference 0.6 mg/day ; 95 % CI -1.0 to 2.3 ) or 12 ( -0.1 mg/day ; -1.6 to 1.4 ) months of age. Similarly, there were no significant differences in plasma ferritin concentration ( difference -2.6 µg/L ; 95 % CI -10.9 to 5.8 ), body iron ( 0.04 mg/kg ; -1.1 to 1.2 ) or the prevalence of depleted iron stores, early functional iron deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia ( all p≥0.65 ) at 12 months of age. A baby-led approach to complementary feeding does not appear to increase the risk of iron deficiency in infants when their parents are given advice to offer 'high-iron ' foods with each meal.
