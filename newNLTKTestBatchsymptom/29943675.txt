 < b > < i > Background<PERSON> < /i > < /b >: Macro-thyroid-stimulating hormone ( macro-TSH ) is a high-molecular-weight form of TSH<ORGANIZATION> that leads to hyperthyrotropinemia. This study was undertaken to examine the prevalence and nature of macro-TSH in females of reproductive age. < b > < i > Methods<PERSON> < /i > < /b >: Blood samples were taken from 1,794 female patients who visited the Hamada Obstetric<ORGANIZATION> and Gynecology Hospital<ORGANIZATION> in Tokyo<GPE>, Japan<GPE> complaining of infertility. The serum of 305 patients with TSH<ORGANIZATION> concentrations > 2.5 mU/L was screened for macro-TSH by the polyethylene glycol ( PEG<ORGANIZATION> ) method. Samples<PERSON> with TSH<ORGANIZATION> precipitation ratios by PEG<ORGANIZATION> > 70 % were further analyzed using gel filtration chromatography ( GFC<ORGANIZATION> ), protein G columns and 125I-TSH binding experiments. < b > < i > Results<PERSON> < /i > < /b >: Screening of the 305 patients revealed that 63 had serum TSH<ORGANIZATION> precipitation ratios > 70 %. GFC<ORGANIZATION> revealed that immunoreactive TSH<ORGANIZATION>, with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa, eluted at higher ratios ( 79.6 ± 24.4 % ) in 27 of the 63 patients, compared to 0.4 ± 2.0 % in the control group. Serum TSH<PERSON> concentrations in 24 of the 27 patients were spuriously elevated due to human anti-mouse antibodies. We found macro-TSH in the other three patients and one of them had detectable anti-TSH autoantibodies. Eight of the remaining 36 patients, who did not have high-molecular-weight TSH<ORGANIZATION> assessed by GFC<ORGANIZATION>, had immunoglobulin G-associated TSH. Three<PERSON> commercially available TSH<ORGANIZATION> immunoassays ( Elecsys®, Centaur®, and Architect® ) all recognized macro-TSH leading to the elevated serum TSH<ORGANIZATION> concentrations. < b > < i > Conclusions<ORGANIZATION> < /i > < /b >: Macro-TSH was present in 0.17 % of infertile women. Commercial<ORGANIZATION> TSH<ORGANIZATION> immunoassays recognized macro-TSH, resulting in the diagnosis of hyperthyrotropinemia.
