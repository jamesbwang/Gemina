 Pyroptosis<GPE> is a novel type of programmed cell death, which is closely related with the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS<ORGANIZATION> ). The recent studies showed that all of S100A9/TLR4, S100A9/CD33 and Nox/ROS signaling pathways can activate oxygen-sensitivity NLRP3<ORGANIZATION> inflammasome and then induce the pyroptosis of hematopoeitic stem cells ( HSC<ORGANIZATION> ) / hematopeitic pregenitor cells ( HPC<ORGANIZATION> ), resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis in patients with MDS<ORGANIZATION>. Further studies on the role and molecular mechanism of pyroptosis in the pathogenesis of MDS<ORGANIZATION> will provide the potential opportunity for the diagnosis and treatment of MDS<ORGANIZATION>. Here, the recent advances in the role and mechnism of pyroptosis in the pathogenesis of MDS<ORGANIZATION> are reviewed.
