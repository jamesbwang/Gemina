 Muscular<GPE> dystrophy ( MD ) is a group of muscle weakness disease involving in inherited genetic conditions. MD is caused by mutations or alteration in the genes responsible for the structure and functioning of muscles. There are many different types of MD which have a wide range from mild symptoms to severe disability. Some types involve the muscles used for breathing which eventually affect life expectancy. This chapter provides an overview of the MD<ORGANIZATION> types, its gene mutations, and the Drosophila<ORGANIZATION> MD models. Specifically, the Duchenne<ORGANIZATION> muscular dystrophy ( DMD<ORGANIZATION> ), the most common form of MD<ORGANIZATION>, will be thoroughly discussed including Dystrophin<ORGANIZATION> genes, their isoforms, possible mechanisms, and signaling pathways of pathogenesis.
