 For patients with heart failure, there is an inverse relation between body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ) and mortality, sometimes called the obesity-paradox. However, the relationship might be either U- or J-shaped and might differ between patients with reduced ( HFrEF<ORGANIZATION> ) or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction ( HFpEF<ORGANIZATION> ). We sought to investigate this further in a dose-response meta-analysis of published studies. PubMed<ORGANIZATION> and Embase<GPE> from June 1980 to April 2017 were searched for prospective cohort studies evaluating associations between BMI<ORGANIZATION> and all-cause mortality in patients with HFrEF<ORGANIZATION> ( LVEF<ORGANIZATION> < 40 % ) or HFpEF<ORGANIZATION> ( LVEF<ORGANIZATION> â‰¥ 50 % ). Summary<PERSON> estimated effect sizes were obtained by using a random-effects model. Potential non-linear relationships were evaluated by using random-effects restricted cubic spline models. Ten studies were identified that included 96,424 patients of whom 59,263 had HFpEF<ORGANIZATION> ( mean age 68 years of whom 38 % were women ) and 37,161 had HFrEF<ORGANIZATION> ( mean age 60 years of whom 17 % were women ). For patients with HFpEF<ORGANIZATION>, the summary hazard ratio ( HR ) for all-cause mortality was: 0.93 ( 95 % CI 0.89-0.97 ) per 5 units increase in BMI<GPE> ( I For patients with heart failure, the relation between BMI<ORGANIZATION> and mortality is U-shaped with a similar nadir of risk for HFpEF<ORGANIZATION> and HFrEF<ORGANIZATION> at a BMI<ORGANIZATION> of 32-33 kg/m
