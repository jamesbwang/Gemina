 Photodynamic<GPE> therapy ( PDT<ORGANIZATION> ) is widely used in dermatology to treat precancerous skin lesions and superficial non-melanoma skin cancers ( NMSCs<ORGANIZATION> ), including premalignant actinic keratosis, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and superficial basal cell carcinoma. The long-term cure rates of PDT<ORGANIZATION> range from 70 to 90 % in NMSC<ORGANIZATION> patients, with excellent cosmetic results and good tolerance. However, the mechanism of action of PDT<ORGANIZATION> on tumors is complex. PDT not only kills tumor cells directly but also rapidly recruits immune cells to release inflammatory mediators to activate antitumor immunity. PDT-induced tumor death, also called immunogenic cell death, can trigger both innate and adaptive immune response, further enhancing the antitumor effect. For instance, inoculation of tumor cells killed via PDT<ORGANIZATION> to animals triggered a stronger antitumor immunity in vivo than tumor cell lysates produced by other treatments. More importantly, many immunotherapy regimens based on the immune effect of PDT<ORGANIZATION> have been developed and demonstrated to be a promising therapeutic method for cancer in pre-clinical trials. Therefore, increasing efforts have been undertaken to investigate the immune responses associated with PDT<ORGANIZATION>. In the present review, we first introduce the antitumor effect and the associated mechanisms of PDT<ORGANIZATION> in cancers. Then, we summarize studies on the immune responses induced by PDT<ORGANIZATION> in NMSCs<GPE>. We also discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the process.
