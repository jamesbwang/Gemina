 White<GPE> matter hyperintensity volume ( WMHV<ORGANIZATION> ) and subclinical brain infarcts ( SBI<ORGANIZATION> ) are associated with impaired mobility, but less is known about the association of WMHV<ORGANIZATION> in specific brain regions. We hypothesized that anterior WMHV<ORGANIZATION> would be associated with lower scores on the Short Physical Performance Battery<ORGANIZATION> ( SPPB<ORGANIZATION> ), a well-validated mobility scale. The SPPB<ORGANIZATION> was measured a median of 5 years after enrollment into the Northern Manhattan<LOCATION> MRI sub study. Volumetric<ORGANIZATION> distributions for WMHV<ORGANIZATION> in 14 brain regions as a proportion of total cranial volume were determined. Multi-variable linear regression was performed to examine the association of SBI<ORGANIZATION> and regional log-WMHV with the SPPB<ORGANIZATION> score. Among 668 participants with SPPB<ORGANIZATION> measurements ( mean 74 ± 9 years, 37 % male and 70 % Hispanic ), the mean SPPB<ORGANIZATION> score was 8.2 ± 2.9. Total ( beta = -0.3 per SD<ORGANIZATION>, p = 0.001 ), anterior periventricular ( beta = -0.4 per SD<ORGANIZATION>, p = 0.001 ), parietal ( beta = -0.2 per SD<ORGANIZATION>, p = 0.02 ) and frontal ( beta = -0.3 per SD<ORGANIZATION>, p = 0.002 ) WMHVs were associated with SPPB<ORGANIZATION> ; other WMHV<ORGANIZATION> and SBI<ORGANIZATION> were not associated with the SPPB<ORGANIZATION>. WMHV<ORGANIZATION>, especially in the anterior -cerebral regions, is associated with a lower SPPB<ORGANIZATION>. Prevention of subclinical cerebrovascular disease is a potential target to prevent physical decline in the elderly.
