 Material<GPE> flow analysis shows that soil is a key repository for silver ( Ag ) from ( nano ) silver-functionalised consumer products, but the potential effects of Ag<GPE> toxicity, via Ag+ release, on soil microbial communities and their ecosystem services remains largely unknown. We examined the responses of multiple microbial biomarkers to increasing Ag+ doses ( nine concentrations, 0-2000 mg kg-1 ) in nine different soils representing a wide range of soil properties. Analyses<PERSON> included substrate-induced microbial respiration, nine different soil enzyme activities, and quantification of bacterial 16S-rRNA ( SSU<ORGANIZATION> ) and fungal intergenic spacer ( ITS<ORGANIZATION> ) gene copies. The resulting half maximal effective concentrations ( EC50<ORGANIZATION> ) for Ag<PERSON> ranged from ~1 to > 500 mg kg -1 and showed soil-specific responses, including some hormesis-type responses. Carbon<PERSON> cycle-associated enzyme activities ( e.g. cellobiohydrolase, xylosidase, and α/β-glucosidase ) responded similarly to Ag<GPE>. Sulfatase<PERSON> and leucine-aminopeptidase activities ( linked to the sulfur and nitrogen cycles ) were the most sensitive to Ag<GPE>. Total<PERSON> organic carbon, and to a lesser extent pH, were identified as potentially useful response predictors, but only for some biomarkers ; this reflects the complexity of soil Ag chemistry. Our results show Ag toxicity is highly dependent on soil characteristics and the specific microbial parameter under investigation, but endpoint redundancies also indicated that representative parameters for key microbial functions can be identified for risk assessment purposes. Sulfatase<PERSON> activity may be an important Ag toxicity biomarker ; its response was highly sensitive and not correlated with that of other biomarkers.
