 The Achilles<ORGANIZATION> tendon ( AT ) moment arm transforms triceps surae muscle forces into a moment about the ankle which is critical for functional activities like walking. Moreover, the AT<ORGANIZATION> moment arm changes continuously during walking, as it depends on both ankle joint rotation and triceps surae muscle loading ( presumably due to bulging of the muscle belly ). Here, we posit that aging negatively effects the architecturally complex AT moment arm during walking, which thereby contributes to well-documented reductions in ankle moment generation during push-off. We used motion capture-guided ultrasound imaging to quantify instantaneous variations in the AT<ORGANIZATION> moment arms of young ( 23.9 ± 4.3 years ) and older ( 69.9 ± 2.6 years ) adults during walking, their dependence on triceps surae muscle loading, and their association with ankle moment generation during push-off. Older adults walked with 11 % smaller AT moment arms and 11 % smaller peak ankle moments during push-off than young adults. Moreover, as hypothesized, these unfavourable changes were significantly and positively correlated ( r
