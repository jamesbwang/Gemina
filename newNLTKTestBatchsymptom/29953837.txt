 This secondary analysis quantified the psychometric properties of the Ohio Modified<ORGANIZATION> Arm-Motor Ability Test ( OMAAT<ORGANIZATION> ) in a sample of neurologically stable chronic stroke survivors ( n = 67, 40 men ; mean age 59.8 yr, standard deviation = 12.8 ; 42 White<FACILITY>, 23 Black, 2 other ; 92.5 % right-sided lesion ; 44 ischemic stroke ). Findings indicate high OMAAT<ORGANIZATION> internal consistency ( Cronbach<ORGANIZATION> 's α = .97, ordinal α = .98, Gugiu<PERSON> 's bootstrap reliability = .97 ), unidimensionality, and strong positive factor loadings for all 20 OMAAT items. Convergent validity between OMAAT<ORGANIZATION> and Action Research Arm Test<ORGANIZATION> total scores was strong ( r = .90, p < .0001 ). The OMAAT<ORGANIZATION> is the first short measure of upper extremity functional limitation available to clinicians and researchers that includes an administration manual and that has been examined using nonparametric psychometrics. A detailed administration manual is provided as a supplement to this article.
