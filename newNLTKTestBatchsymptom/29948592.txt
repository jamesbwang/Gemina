 The benefit of optical coherence tomography ( OCT<ORGANIZATION> ) guidance in percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI<ORGANIZATION> ) is unclear. We aimed to assess the incremental value of adding OCT<ORGANIZATION> to coronary angiography in PCI by meta-analytic<ORGANIZATION> technique. We searched PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, EMBASE<ORGANIZATION>, Cochrane<GPE>, Scopus<PERSON> and relevant references for randomized studies ( inception through January 5, 2018 without language restrictions ) and performed meta-analysis using random effects model. Major adverse cardiac events ( MACE<ORGANIZATION> ), all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis, fluoroscopic time, contrast volume, and procedural side effects were the measured outcomes. Five randomized studies with a total population of 931 were analyzed. There was no difference in MACE<ORGANIZATION> between angiography plus OCT<ORGANIZATION> and angiography alone arms ( 2.5 vs. 2.0 % OR 1.26 ; 95 % CI 0.40-3.99 ; P = 0.69 ; I
