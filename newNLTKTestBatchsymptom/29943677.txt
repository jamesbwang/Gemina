 Objectives Pain<GPE> is common among patients with cancer, stemming from both malignancy and side effects of treatment. The extent to which pain persists after treatment has received little attention. We examined the prevalence, predictors, and impact on quality of life ( QOL<ORGANIZATION> ) caused by pain among survivors of head and neck cancer. Study Design Cohort<PERSON> study. Setting Tertiary head and neck cancer survivorship clinic. Subjects and Methods<ORGANIZATION> We identified survivors of head and neck cancer â‰¥1 year after diagnosis and examined the prevalence and risk factors for development of pain. Pain<PERSON> and QOL<ORGANIZATION> were assessed with multiple QOL<ORGANIZATION> instruments. Ordinal regression modeling examined predictors of pain in survivors. Results We identified 175 patients at a median of 6.6 years after diagnosis. Among survivors, 45.1 % reported pain, and 11.5 % reported severe pain. Among patients with current pain, 46 % reported low overall QOL<ORGANIZATION> versus only 12 % of those without pain ( P<PERSON> < .001 ). On multivariable analysis after adjustment for age, sex, and stage of disease, pain was associated with trimodality treatment ( odds ratio [ OR ], 3.55 ; 95 % CI, 1.06-12.77 ). Multivariable analysis of QOL<ORGANIZATION> issues revealed that pain was associated with major depression ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 3.91 ; 95 % CI, 1.68-9.11 ), anxiety ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 4.22 ; 95 % CI, 2.28-7.81 ), poor recreation ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 3.31 ; 95 % CI, 1.70-6.48 ), and low overall QOL<ORGANIZATION> ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 2.20 ; 95 % CI, 1.12-4.34 ). Conclusions Years after head and neck cancer treatment, pain remains a significant problem and is associated with worse QOL<ORGANIZATION>. Future efforts should focus on preventing pain from treatment and comprehensive management.
