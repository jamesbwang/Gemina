 Mice lacking the substance P ( SP ) neurokinin-1 ( NK1<ORGANIZATION> ) receptor ( NK1R-/-mice ) were used to investigate whether SP<ORGANIZATION> affects serotonin ( 5-HT ) function in the brain and to assess the effects of acute immobilisation stress on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical ( HPA<ORGANIZATION> ) axis and 5-HT turnover in individual brain nuclei. Basal HPA<PERSON> activity and the expression of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH<ORGANIZATION> ) in wild-type ( WT ) - and NK1R-/- mice were identical. Stress-induced increases in plasma ACTH<ORGANIZATION> concentration were considerably higher in NK1R-/- mice than in WT<GPE> mice while corticosterone concentrations were equally elevated in both mouse lines. Acute<PERSON> stress did not alter the expression of CRH<ORGANIZATION>. In the dorsal raphe nucleus ( DRN<ORGANIZATION> ), basal 5-HT turnover was increased in NK1R-/- mice and a 15 min stress further magnified 5-HT utilisation in this region. In the frontoparietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, central nucleus of amygdala, and the hippocampal CA1<ORGANIZATION> region, stress increased 5-HT and/or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5-HIAA ) concentrations to a similar extent in WT and NK1R-/- mice. 5-HT turnover in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus was not affected by stress, but stress induced similar increases in 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei in WT and NK1R-/- mice. Our findings indicate that NK1<ORGANIZATION> receptor activation suppresses ACTH<ORGANIZATION> release during acute stress but does not exert sustained inhibition of the HPA<ORGANIZATION> axis. Genetic deletion of the NK1<ORGANIZATION> receptor accelerates 5-HT turnover in DRN<ORGANIZATION> under basal and stress conditions. No differences between the responses of serotonergic system to acute stress in WT and NK1R-/- mice occur in forebrain nuclei linked to the regulation of anxiety and neuroendocrine stress responses.
