 Recent studies imply that glial activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and major depression. We previously demonstrated that Gunn<PERSON> rats with hyperbilirubinemia show congenital gliosis and schizophrenia-like behavior. As it has been suggested that major depression involves glial activation associated with neuroinflammation, we examined whether Gunn<PERSON> rats show depression-like behavior using the forced swimming test ( FST<ORGANIZATION> ) and the tail suspension test ( TST<ORGANIZATION> ). In addition, we quantitatively evaluated both microgliosis and astrogliosis in the hippocampus of Gunn<GPE> rats using immunohistochemistry analysis of the microglial marker ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule ( Iba ) 1 and the astrocytic marker S100B<PERSON>. Both the FST<ORGANIZATION> and TST<ORGANIZATION> showed that immobility time of Gunn<GPE> rats was significantly longer than that of normal control Wistar<ORGANIZATION> rats, indicating that Gunn<GPE> rats are somewhat helpless, a sign of depression-like behavior. In the quantification of immunohistochemical analysis, Iba1immunoreactivity<ORGANIZATION> in the dentate gyrus ( DG ), cornu ammonis ( CA ) 1, and CA3<ORGANIZATION> and the number of Iba1-positive cells in the CA1<ORGANIZATION> and CA3<ORGANIZATION> were significantly increased in Gunn<GPE> rats compared to Wistar<GPE> rats. S100B<PERSON> immunoreactivity in the DG<ORGANIZATION>, CA1<ORGANIZATION>, and CA3<ORGANIZATION> and the number of S100B-positive cells in the DG<ORGANIZATION> and CA3<ORGANIZATION> were significantly increased in Gunn<GPE> rats compared to Wistar<GPE> rats. Our findings suggest that both microglia and astrocyte are activated in Gunn<GPE> rats and their learned helplessness could be related to glial activation.
