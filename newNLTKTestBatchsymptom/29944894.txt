 Guideline<GPE> compliant CPR<ORGANIZATION> is associated with improved survival for patients with cardiac arrest. Conventional Basic Life Support ( BLS<ORGANIZATION> ) training results in suboptimal CPR<ORGANIZATION> competency and skill retention. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of distributed CPR<ORGANIZATION> training with real-time feedback to conventional BLS<ORGANIZATION> training for CPR<ORGANIZATION> skills in pediatric healthcare providers. Healthcare providers were randomized into receiving annual BLS<ORGANIZATION> training ( control ) or distributed training with real-time feedback ( intervention ). The intervention group was asked to practice CPR<ORGANIZATION> for 2 min on mannequins while receiving real-time CPR<ORGANIZATION> feedback, at least once per month. Control<ORGANIZATION> group participants were not asked to practice CPR<ORGANIZATION> during the study period. Excellent CPR<ORGANIZATION> was defined as 90 % guideline-compliance for depth, rate and recoil of chest compressions. CPR<ORGANIZATION> performance of participants was assessed ( on infant and adult-sized mannequins ) every 3 months for a duration of 12 months. CPR<ORGANIZATION> performance was compared between the 2 groups. A total of 87 healthcare providers were included in the analyses ( control n = 41, intervention n = 46 ). Baseline<PERSON> assessment showed no significant difference in CPR<ORGANIZATION> performance across the 2 groups. The intervention group has a significantly greater proportion of participants with excellent CPR<ORGANIZATION> compared with the control group on an adult sized mannequin ( 14.6 % vs. 54.3 %, p < 0.001 ) and infant-sized mannequin ( 19.5 % vs. 71.7 %, p < 0.001 ) at the end of the study. In the intervention group, all CPR metrics except infant depth were improved and retained over the course of the study. Distributed CPR<ORGANIZATION> training with real-time feedback improves the compliance of AHA<ORGANIZATION> guidelines of quality of CPR<ORGANIZATION>.
