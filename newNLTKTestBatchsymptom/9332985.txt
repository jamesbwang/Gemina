 Thrombocytopenia<GPE> occurs to approximately 8 % -10 % of pregnant women and this condition is a notable source of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. In the recent years, our comprehension of thrombocytopenia has progressed on pregnancy. Nevertheless, there has not been adequate information about thrombocytopenia outcomes in obstetric patients. With regard to this topic, we reviewed published reports as an update from the managements on these cases. Nevertheless, recommendations for management of delivery in obstetric women with thrombocytopenia are based on several hypotheses requiring critical analysis. For this cause, we reviewed the management of pregnant patients with thrombocytopenia treated over a period of 37 years.
