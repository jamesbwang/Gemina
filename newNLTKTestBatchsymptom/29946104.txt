 Dopamine<GPE> neurons in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA<ORGANIZATION> ) influence learned behaviors and neuropsychiatric diseases including addiction. The stress peptide corticotrophin-releasing factor ( CRF<ORGANIZATION> ) contributes to relapse to drug and alcohol seeking following withdrawal, although the cellular actions are poorly understood. In this study, we show that presynaptic CRF<ORGANIZATION> type 1 receptors ( CRF-R1 ) potentiate GABA<ORGANIZATION> release onto mouse VTA<ORGANIZATION> dopamine neurons via a PKC-Ca
