 To describe the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT<ORGANIZATION> ) who develop oral mucositis. 45 patients who underwent HCT<ORGANIZATION> from July 2015 to May 2016 at St. Jude Children<ORGANIZATION> 's Research Hospital in Memphis<GPE>, Tennessee<GPE>. Clinical<PERSON> factors were described as transplantation type, mucositis severity or grade, mucositis duration, days to engraftment, total parenteral nutrition ( TPN<ORGANIZATION> ) support, IV<ORGANIZATION> opioid pain management use during mucositis, positive blood or oral cultures, and length of hospitalization, then compared across mucositis grade. 24 patients had grade 3 or greater mucositis onset from day -3 to day 9 of transplantation ; of these, 23 required IV<ORGANIZATION> opioid medication to treat mucosal pain. Patients with mucositis grade 3 or greater were more likely to have undergone an allogeneic transplantation, receive TPN<ORGANIZATION>, have documented positive blood or oral cultures, and have longer hospitalizations than those with low-grade mucositis. Nurses are in a unique position to propose and administer interventions to prevent and alleviate symptoms of mucositis.
