 A healthy 14-year-old, male neutered, Miniature Poodle<PERSON> was found to have a persistent erythrocyte macrocytosis and reticulocytosis with a normal and stable HCT<ORGANIZATION>. The hematologic features of macrocytosis, increased Howell-Jolly bodies, and metarubricytosis, in the absence of anemia or other cytopenias, combined with the cytologic evidence of bone marrow erythroid dysplasia, including megaloblastosis, binuclearity, increased mitotic activity, and nuclear fragmentation, are consistent with previous reports of congenital dyserythropoiesis termed poodle macrocytosis. We speculate that the additional presence of persistent reticulocytosis in the absence of an identifiable stimulus for accelerated erythropoiesis may represent a phenotypic variation of this inherited condition, and the morphologic abnormalities of the dyserythropoiesis are described.
