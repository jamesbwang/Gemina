 To investigate the associated factors with the vibration threshold perception ( VPT<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with type 2 diabetes and to assess whether it is useful for detection of diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN<ORGANIZATION> ). VPTs were measured with Vibration Sensory Analyzer<PERSON> ( VSA-3000 ) in 426 diabetic patients. The diagnosis of DPN<ORGANIZATION> was based on Neuropathy Symptom Score<ORGANIZATION> and Neuropathy Disability Score<PERSON> ( NDS<ORGANIZATION> ). ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve analysis and multiple linear and logistic regressions were performed to investigate the associations between VPT<ORGANIZATION> and DPN<ORGANIZATION>. Values of VPT<ORGANIZATION> were progressively higher according to NDS<ORGANIZATION> stages. Age, height, diabetes duration, and mean cumulative HbA<ORGANIZATION> VPT, measured by an automatic device, shares common correlates with DPN<ORGANIZATION> and is strongly associated with its presence. VPT<ORGANIZATION> testing may be useful as a screening tool for DPN<ORGANIZATION> assessment.
