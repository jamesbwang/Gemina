 Weight<GPE> loss is often key in the management of obese or overweight patients with type 2 diabetes, yet few treatments for diabetes achieve clinically meaningful weight loss. We aimed to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of treatment with MEDI0382<ORGANIZATION>, a balanced glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon receptor dual agonist developed to provide glycaemic control and weight loss, in patients with type 2 diabetes. This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, combined multiple-ascending dose ( MAD<ORGANIZATION> ) and phase 2a study was done at 11 study sites ( hospitals and contract research organisations ) in Germany<GPE>. We enrolled patients aged 18-65 years with controlled type 2 diabetes ( glycated haemoglobin A Patients were recruited between Dec 9, 2015, and Feb 24, 2017. 61 patients were randomly assigned to the MAD<ORGANIZATION> part of the study ( 42 to MEDI0382<ORGANIZATION> and 19 to placebo ). 51 patients were randomly assigned to the phase 2a part, of whom 25 were randomly assigned to MEDI0382<ORGANIZATION> and 26 to placebo. In the phase 2a study, three patients in the MEDI0382<ORGANIZATION> group and one in the placebo group discontinued, all as a result of adverse events. 22 ( 88 % ) patients in the MEDI0382<ORGANIZATION> group and 25 ( 96 % ) in the placebo group received at least one dose and had measurements taken at baseline and day 41. Glucose AUC<ORGANIZATION> MEDI0382<ORGANIZATION> has the potential to deliver clinically meaningful reductions in blood glucose and bodyweight in obese or overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes.
