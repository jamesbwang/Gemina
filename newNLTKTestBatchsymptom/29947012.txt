 Pembrolizumab<GPE>, a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G4 antibody that is directed against the human cell surface receptor PD-1, is a PD-1 pathway inhibitor that has been approved to treat various malignant diseases, including advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ). PD-1 is the major inhibitory receptor regulating T-cell exhaustion, and T-cells with high PD-1 expression lose their ability to eliminate cancer. PD-1 pathway blockade by pembrolizumab reinvigorates exhausted T-cells and restores their antitumor immune responses. However, reinvigorated T-cells also evoke immune-related adverse effects ( irAEs<ORGANIZATION> ), which stem from the restored activity. Currently, the pathogenic mechanisms of irAEs<ORGANIZATION> have not been sufficiently determined. We experienced a patient with NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> with high PD-L1 expression and cervical lymph node metastases, who demonstrated a good clinical response to first line pembrolizumab but suffered from a severe cutaneous adverse event. Both of his skin lesions and cervical metastases showed extensive CD8<ORGANIZATION> ( + ) PD-1 ( + ) T-cell infiltration in immunofluorescence analysis. This finding suggests a possible contribution of reinvigorated CD8<ORGANIZATION> ( + ) PD-1 ( + ) T-cells in anti-PD-1 therapy-induced skin rash. Intriguingly, CD8<ORGANIZATION> ( + ) T-cells in the skin rash showed higher Ki-67 expression, a proliferation marker, than those in the cervical lymph node lesion. This is the first report of an association between proliferative CD8<ORGANIZATION> ( + ) PD-1 ( + ) T-cells and irAEs<ORGANIZATION>.
