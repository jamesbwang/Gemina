 Pattern<GPE> recognition receptors ( PRR<ORGANIZATION> ) are plasma membrane ( PM ) proteins that recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns ( MAMPs<ORGANIZATION> ), triggering an immune response. PRR are classified as receptor like kinases ( RLKs<ORGANIZATION> ) or receptor like proteins ( RLPs<ORGANIZATION> ). The PM<ORGANIZATION> localization of PRRs<ORGANIZATION>, which is crucial for their availability to sense MAMPs<ORGANIZATION>, depends on their appropriate trafficking through the endomembrane system. Recently, we have identified SlPRA1A<ORGANIZATION>, a prenylated RAB<ORGANIZATION> acceptor type-1 ( PRA1<ORGANIZATION> ) from S. lycopersicum, as a regulator of RLP-PRR localization and protein levels. SlPRA1A<ORGANIZATION> overexpression strongly decreases RLP-PRR protein levels, particularly those of LeEIX2<ORGANIZATION>, redirecting it to the vacuole for degradation. Interestingly, SlPRA1A<ORGANIZATION> does not affect RLK-PRRs, indicating its activity to be specific to RLP-PRR systems. As PRA1<ORGANIZATION> proteins stabilize RABs<ORGANIZATION> on membranes, promoting RABs<ORGANIZATION> activity, we aimed to identify a RAB<ORGANIZATION> target of SlPRA1A<ORGANIZATION>. Screening of a set of A. thaliana RABs revealed that AtRABA1e<ORGANIZATION> is able to mimic SlPRA1A<ORGANIZATION> activity. Through live cell imaging, we observed that SlPRA1A<ORGANIZATION> enhances AtRABA1e<ORGANIZATION> localization on SlPRA1A<ORGANIZATION> positive punctuated structures. These results indicate that AtRABA1e<ORGANIZATION> is a putative target of SlPRA1<ORGANIZATION>, and a co-regulator of LeEIX2<ORGANIZATION> trafficking and degradation.
