 IVIM-DW imaging has shown potential usefulness in the study of pancreatic lesions. Controversial results are available regarding the reliability of the measurements of IVIM-derived parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and the diagnostic potential of IVIM-derived parameters in differentiation among focal solid pancreatic lesions and normal pancreas ( NP ). Fifty-seven patients ( 34 carcinomas-PDACs, 18 neuroendocrine neoplasms-panNENs, and 5 autoimmune pancreatitis-AIP ) and 50 subjects with NP<ORGANIZATION> underwent 1.5-T MR imaging including IVIM-DWI. Images were analyzed by two independent readers. Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC<ORGANIZATION> ), slow component of diffusion ( D ), incoherent microcirculation ( Dp ), and perfusion fraction ( f ) were calculated. Interobserver reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC<ORGANIZATION> ). A Kruskal-Wallis H test with Steel-Dwass post hoc test was used for comparison. The diagnostic performance of each parameter was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve analysis. Overall interobserver agreement was excellent ( ICC<ORGANIZATION> = 0.860, 0.937, 0.968, and 0.983 for ADC<ORGANIZATION>, D<GPE>, Dp<GPE>, and f ). D, Dp<GPE>, and f significantly differed among PDACs<ORGANIZATION> and panNENs<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.002, < 0.001, and < 0.001 ), albeit without significant difference at the pairwise comparison of ROC<ORGANIZATION> curves ( p = 0.08-0.74 ). Perfusion fraction was higher in AIP<ORGANIZATION> compared with PDACs<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.024 ; AUC<ORGANIZATION> = 0.735 ). Dp and f were higher in panNENs<ORGANIZATION> compared with AIP<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.029 and 0.023 ), without differences at ROC<ORGANIZATION> analysis ( p = 0.07 ). IVIM-derived parameters have excellent reliability and could help in differentiation among solid pancreatic lesions and NP<ORGANIZATION>.
