 Hormonal disorders are frequently present in hemodialysed patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). In women with CKD<ORGANIZATION> sex hormones abnormalities may lead to irregular, often anovulatory cycles, sexual dysfunction and infertility. Kidney<PERSON> transplantation done in young women tends to ameliorate most of the aforementioned disorders and improve fertility. The aim of this study was to assess the changes of serum sex hormones concentration in young women before, and after the first 6 months after successful KTx Material<ORGANIZATION> and methods: Fourteen chronic hemodialysis women with CKD<ORGANIZATION> undergoing kidney transplantation and 46 apparently healthy women in similar age ( control group ) were enrolled into the study. In all women serum concentration of: FSH, LH<ORGANIZATION>, PRL<ORGANIZATION> and estradiol determined. Measurements in the transplanted group were done four times: immediately before surgery, in the 14th - and 30th - day and 6 months after the transplantation. The results are presented as means and 95 % CI. All of the women that have finished the study presented an excellent function of the transplanted kidney - mean serum creatinine concentration was 92.54 ( 74.85 - 110.23 ) Âµmol/l. After successful KTx a significant decrease in the serum concentrations of FSH<ORGANIZATION> and LH<ORGANIZATION> was observed. Decrease of serum PRL<ORGANIZATION> concentration after KTx<ORGANIZATION> did not reach statistical significance in the multiple comparisons analyses, but returned to the values observed in healthy controls. KTx<ORGANIZATION> did not significantly influence serum estradiol concentration. Successful kidney transplantation leads to the normalization of serum concentrations of hormones linked to fertility disorders in women with chronic kidney disease. < p > < /p >.
