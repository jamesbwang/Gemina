 St Lucia is a small island in the eastern Caribbean<LOCATION> with a population of approximately 200 000 people. Although St Lucia<PERSON> is formally ranked as a high middle-income country, there are pockets of deprivation and relatively low living standards. Mental<ORGANIZATION> health services in St<GPE> Lucia have increased considerably and advanced over recent years because of a coalition between the government of the island and South East<GPE> Asian<GPE> partners. The National Mental Wellness Centre<ORGANIZATION> opened several years ago and has much improved facilities. There remains a significant shortage of community-based services, no mental health law, and a pervasive community stigma and apprehension regarding those with mental health problems.
