 Reaction<GPE> time ( RT ) is the time interval between the appearance of a stimulus and initiation of a motor response. Within RT<ORGANIZATION>, two processes occur, selection of motor goals and motor planning. An unresolved question is whether perturbation to the motor planning component of RT<ORGANIZATION> slows the response and alters the voluntary activation of muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine how the modulation of muscle activity during a RT response changes with motor plan perturbation. Twenty-four young adults ( 20.5 { plus minus } 1.1 years, 13 women ) performed 15 trials of an isometric RT task with ankle dorsiflexion using a sinusoidal anticipatory strategy ( 10-20 % MVC ). We compared the processing part of the RT<ORGANIZATION> and modulation of muscle activity from 10-60 Hz of the tibialis anterior ( primary agonist ) when the stimulus appeared at the trough or at the peak of the sinusoidal task. We found that RT ( P<PERSON> = 0.003 ) was longer when the stimulus occurred at the peak compared with the trough. During the time of the reaction, the EMG<ORGANIZATION> power from 10-35 Hz was less at the peak than the trough ( P<PERSON> = 0.019 ), whereas the EMG<ORGANIZATION> power from 35-60 Hz was similar between the peak and trough ( P<PERSON> = 0.92 ). These results suggest that perturbation to motor planning lengthens the processing part of RT<ORGANIZATION> and alters the voluntary activation of the muscle by decreasing the relative amount of power from 10-35 Hz.
