 OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of each of 3 incremental doses of MK-467 for alleviation of dexmedetomidine-induced hemodynamic depression in isoflurane-anesthetized cats. ANIMALS 6 healthy adult domestic shorthair cats. PROCEDURES Each cat was anesthetized with isoflurane and received a target-controlled infusion of dexmedetomidine estimated to maintain the plasma dexmedetomidine concentration at 10 ng/mL throughout the experiment. Heart rate ( HR ) and direct arterial pressures were measured at baseline ( isoflurane administration only ), during dexmedetomidine infusion, and before and after IV<ORGANIZATION> administration of each of 3 serially increasing doses ( 15, 30, and 60 μg/kg ) of MK-467. Cardiac<PERSON> index ( CI ) and systemic vascular resistance ( SVR<ORGANIZATION> ) were recorded at baseline, during dexmedetomidine infusion, and at the mean arterial pressure nadir after administration of the 30- and 60-μg/kg doses of MK-467. RESULTS<ORGANIZATION> Compared with baseline values, the dexmedetomidine infusion significantly decreased HR<ORGANIZATION> and increased arterial pressures. Each dose of MK-467 caused a significant decrease in arterial pressures and a significant, albeit clinically irrelevant, increase in HR<GPE> ( ≤ 10 % ). Following administration of the 30- and 60-μg/kg doses of MK-467, all cats developed clinical hypotension ( mean arterial pressure, < 60 mm Hg ) even though CI<ORGANIZATION> and SVR<ORGANIZATION> returned to baseline values. CONCLUSIONS<ORGANIZATION> AND CLINICAL<ORGANIZATION> RELEVANCE Results<PERSON> indicated administration of small doses of MK-467 to isoflurane-anesthetized cats receiving dexmedetomidine restored CI<ORGANIZATION> and SVR<ORGANIZATION>, but caused a substantial decrease in arterial pressures and only a marginal increase in HR. Therefore, caution should be used when MK-467 is administered to alleviate dexmedetomidine-induced hemodynamic depression in isoflurane-anesthetized cats.
