 Deficiency of ADA2<ORGANIZATION> ( DADA2<ORGANIZATION> ) is the first molecularly described monogenic vasculitis syndrome. DADA2<ORGANIZATION> is caused by biallelic hypomorphic mutations in the ADA2<ORGANIZATION> gene that encodes the adenosine deaminase 2 ( ADA2<ORGANIZATION> ) protein. Over 60 disease-associated mutations have been identified in all domains of ADA2<ORGANIZATION> affecting the catalytic activity, protein dimerization, and secretion. Vasculopathy ranging from livedo reticularis to polyarteritis nodosa ( PAN<ORGANIZATION> ) and life-threatening ischemic and/or hemorrhagic stroke dominate the clinical features of DADA2<ORGANIZATION>. Vasculitis<PERSON> and inflammation can affect many organs, explaining the intestinal, hepatological, and renal manifestations. DADA2 should be primarily considered in patients with early-onset fevers, rashes, and strokes even in the absence of positive family history. Hematological manifestations include most commonly hypogammaglobulinemia, although pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA<ORGANIZATION> ), immune thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia have been increasingly reported. Thus, DADA2<ORGANIZATION> may unify a variety of syndromes previously not thought to be related. The first-line treatment consists of TNF-inhibitors and is effective in controlling inflammation and in preserving vascular integrity. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT<ORGANIZATION> ) has been successful in a group of patients presenting with hematological manifestations. ADA2<ORGANIZATION> is highly expressed in myeloid cells and plays a role in the differentiation of macrophages ; however, its function is still largely undetermined. Deficiency of ADA2<ORGANIZATION> has been linked to an imbalance in differentiation of monocytes towards proinflammatory M1 macrophages. Future<PERSON> research on the function of ADA2<ORGANIZATION> and on the pathophysiology of DADA2<ORGANIZATION> will improve our understanding of the condition and promote early diagnosis and targeted treatment.
