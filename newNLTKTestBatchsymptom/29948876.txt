 Solid<GPE> pseudopapillary tumour is a rare carcinoma of the pancreas with low-grade malignant potential that typically presents in females in their third decade. The tumour most commonly occurs in the tail of the pancreas, although any site can be affected. Surgical resection is the standard treatment and offers an excellent prognosis. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery is an emerging technique for the treatment of pancreatic neoplasms. We report a case of a 17-year-old female with acute onset abdominal pain who was found to have a mass in the distal pancreas. A robotic-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation was successfully performed, its first reported use in a pediatric patient. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery. The robotic approach can be considered for younger patients presenting with a solid pseudopapillary tumour in the distal pancreas.
