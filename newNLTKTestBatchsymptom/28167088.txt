 A 42-year-old woman without a history of catheter ablation or cardiac surgery was referred to our institution for a paroxysmal atrial tachycardia ( AT ). Programed stimulation could not induce any AT. The AT spontaneously initiated during a continuous isoproterenol infusion. The earliest activation during the AT<ORGANIZATION> was recorded at the cavo-tricuspid isthmus, and local abnormal atrial activity ( LAATA<ORGANIZATION> ) was recorded during sinus rhythm at that same site. When rapid atrial activity was recorded at the cavo-tricuspid isthmus where the LAATA<ORGANIZATION> was recorded, an AT was induced. Radiofrequency<PERSON> ablation was performed over the entire area where the LAATA<ORGANIZATION> was recorded during sinus rhythm, rendering the AT<ORGANIZATION> non-inducible.
