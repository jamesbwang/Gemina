 To assess the binding of the PET<ORGANIZATION> tracer [ The study included 20 PPA patients consecutively recruited through a memory clinic ( 12 NFV, 5 SV, 3 LV ), and 20 healthy controls. All participants received an extensive neurolinguistic assessment, magnetic resonance imaging and amyloid biomarker tests. [ Patients with NFV<ORGANIZATION> showed increased binding in the supplementary motor area, left premotor cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia and midbrain compared with controls and patients with SV<ORGANIZATION>. Patients with SV<ORGANIZATION> had increased binding in the temporal lobes bilaterally and in the right ventromedial frontal cortex compared with controls and patients with NFV<ORGANIZATION>. The whole-brain voxel-wise regression analysis revealed a correlation between agrammatism and motor speech impairment, and [ [
