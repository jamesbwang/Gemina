 In order to investigate the effect of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase ( SAMDC<ORGANIZATION> ) gene in melon resistance to powdery mildew, according to the previous results of EST<ORGANIZATION> sequences from cDNA-AFLP library and the melon genome sequence data, the SAMDC<ORGANIZATION> gene was isolated from Chinese<GPE> wild melon clone 'Yuntian930 ' by RT-PCR and designated as CmSAMDC<ORGANIZATION> ( GenBank<ORGANIZATION> Accession No. KF151861 ). The mORF<ORGANIZATION> ( main open reading frame ) was 1 095 bp encoding 364 amino acids with a molecular mass of 40 kDa. The predicted protein sequence showed high similarity with Cucumis<PERSON> sativus and Citrofortunella<GPE> microcarpa. The SDS-PAGE showed that the expression protein was a fusion protein with the molecular weight of 40 kDa, which perfectly matched the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. Quantitative real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION> analysis indicated that the expression level of CmSAMDC<ORGANIZATION> reached a maximum at 48 hpi ( hours post inoculation ) that over 7-fold to 0 hpi, and the expression of CmSAMDC<ORGANIZATION> was also detected in tendril, root, leaf and stem. These results indicate that CmSAMDC<ORGANIZATION> gene may play protective roles in melon resistance to powdery mildew infection.
