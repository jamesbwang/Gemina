 Calpain<GPE> 9 ( CAPN9<ORGANIZATION> ) is expressed in the stomach and small intestine. CAPN9<ORGANIZATION> has regulatory roles in hypertension, heart disease, gastric mucosal defense, and kidney disease. The involvement of CAPN9<ORGANIZATION> has not been reported in the development of chickens. CAPN9 mRNA was found in adipose and muscle tissue in this study. Two linkage single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP<ORGANIZATION> ; G7518A<PERSON> and C7542G<GPE> ) in intron 4 were screened from 160 birds of the D2 chicken line. The 2 mutation sites were associated with carcass weight, evisceration weight, abdominal fat weight ( AFW<ORGANIZATION> ), abdominal fat percentage ( AFP<ORGANIZATION> ), and breast muscle percentage ( all P < 0.05 ). Intramuscular fat ( IMF<ORGANIZATION> ) content was not significantly different in the 3 genotypes. But, the AA<ORGANIZATION> ( 7518 ) /GG ( 7542 ) genotype had the highest IMF<ORGANIZATION> content, highest breast muscle weight, and lower AFW<ORGANIZATION> and AFP<ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, the mRNA<ORGANIZATION> level of CAPN9<ORGANIZATION> in abdominal fat tissue was significantly different ( P < 0.05 or P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) between any 2 genotypes, consistent with AFW<ORGANIZATION> and AFP<ORGANIZATION>. In summary, the expression of CAPN9<ORGANIZATION> in adipose and breast muscle tissue is reported for the first time. CAPN9 affected production performance of chickens. As a marker, the linkage G7518A<PERSON> and C7542G<GPE> polymorphisms in intron 4 of CAPN9<ORGANIZATION> could affect the production traits by regulating mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression. The findings concerning the marker enrich the theoretical foundation for molecular breeding of high-quality broilers.
