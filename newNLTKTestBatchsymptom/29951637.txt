 Integrity<ORGANIZATION> of the recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN<ORGANIZATION> ) and the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve ( EBSLN<ORGANIZATION> ) can be checked by intraoperative nerve monitoring ( IONM<ORGANIZATION> ) after visualization. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and nature of voice dysfunction following thyroid surgery with routine IONM<ORGANIZATION>. Thyroidectomies were performed with routine division of strap muscles and nerve monitoring to confirm integrity of the RLN<ORGANIZATION> and EBSLN<ORGANIZATION> following dissection. Patients were assessed for vocal function before surgery and at 1 and 3 months after operation. Assessment<PERSON> included use of the Voice Handicap Index<ORGANIZATION> ( VHI<ORGANIZATION> ) 10, maximum phonation time, fundamental frequency, pitch range, harmonic to noise ratio, cepstral peak prominence and smoothed cepstral peak prominence. A total of 172 nerves at risk were analysed in 102 consecutive patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery. In 23路3 per cent of EBSLNs<ORGANIZATION> and 0路6 per cent of RLNs<ORGANIZATION> nerve identification required the assistance of IONM<ORGANIZATION> in addition to visualization. Nerve<PERSON> integrity was confirmed during surgery for 98路8 per cent of EBSLNs<ORGANIZATION> and 98路3 per cent of RLNs<ORGANIZATION>. There were no differences between preoperative and postoperative VHI-10 scores. Acoustic voice assessment showed small changes in maximum phonation time at 1 and 3 months after surgery. Where there is routine division of strap muscles, thyroidectomy using nerve monitoring confirmation of RLN<ORGANIZATION> and EBSLN<ORGANIZATION> function following dissection results in no clinically significant voice change.
