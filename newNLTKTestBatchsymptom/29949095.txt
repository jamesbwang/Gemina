 Mutations in the potassium channel gene KCNC3<ORGANIZATION> ( Kv3.3 ) cause the autosomal dominant neurological disease, spinocerebellar ataxia 13 ( SCA13<ORGANIZATION> ). In this study, we expand the genotype-phenotype repertoire of SCA13<ORGANIZATION> by describing the novel KCNC3<ORGANIZATION> deletion p.Pro583_Pro585del highlighting the allelic heterogeneity observed in SCA13<GPE> patients. We characterize adult-onset, progressive clinical symptoms of two afflicted kindred and introduce the symptom of profound spasticity not previously associated with the SCA13<ORGANIZATION> phenotype. We also present molecular and electrophysiological characterizations of the mutant protein in mammalian cell culture. Mechanistically, the p.Pro583_Pro585del protein showed normal membrane trafficking with an altered electrophysiological profile, including slower inactivation and decreased sensitivity to the inactivation-accelerating effects of the actin depolymerizer latrunculin B. Taken<PERSON> together, our results highlight the clinical importance of the intracellular C-terminal portion of Kv3.3 and its association with ion channel function.
