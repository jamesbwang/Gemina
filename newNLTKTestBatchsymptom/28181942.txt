 Mast<GPE> cell activation syndrome ( MCAS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a disorder in which patients experience symptoms and signs attributable to inappropriate mast cell activation and mediator release. Multiorgan<PERSON> involvement in patients can result in significant morbidity and possible mortality. Limited literature exists regarding anesthetic management of patients with MCAS<ORGANIZATION>. We report a case of vaginal delivery with neuraxial labor analgesia in a parturient with this condition and highlight the importance of multidisciplinary planning for uneventful outcomes. Stress<PERSON> can trigger life-threatening symptoms, and counseling is important to allay patients ' fears. Optimum<PERSON> medical control, adequate premedication, avoidance of triggers, and preparedness to treat serious mediator effects are key. We review MCAS<ORGANIZATION> and discuss anesthetic considerations for patients with this mast cell disorder.
