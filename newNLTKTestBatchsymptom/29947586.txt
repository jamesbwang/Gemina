 The healthy vestibulo-ocular reflex ( VOR<ORGANIZATION> ) ensures that images remain on the fovea of the retina during head rotation in order to maintain stable vision. VOR<ORGANIZATION> behavior can be measured as a summation of linear and non-linear properties though it is unknown whether asymmetric VOR<ORGANIZATION> adaptation can be performed synchronously in humans. The purpose of the present study is twofold. First, examine whether the right and left VOR<ORGANIZATION> gains can be synchronously adapted in opposing directions. Second, to investigate whether the adaptation context transfers between both sides. Three separate VOR<ORGANIZATION> adaptation sessions were randomized such that the VOR<ORGANIZATION> was adapted Up-bilaterally ; Down-bilaterally ; or Mixed<GPE> ( one side up, opposite side down ). Ten healthy subjects completed the study. Subjects were tested while seated upright, 1-meter in front of a wall in complete dark. Each subject made active ( self-generated ) head impulse rotations for 15 min while viewing a gradually increasing amount of retinal slip. VOR training demand changed by 10 % every 90 seconds. The VOR<ORGANIZATION> changed significantly for all training conditions. No significant differences in the magnitude of VOR<ORGANIZATION> gain changes between training conditions were found. The human VOR can be simultaneously driven in opposite directions. The similar magnitude of VOR<ORGANIZATION> gain changes across training conditions suggests functionally independent VOR<ORGANIZATION> circuits for each side of head rotation, that mediate simultaneous and opposing VOR<ORGANIZATION> adaptations.
