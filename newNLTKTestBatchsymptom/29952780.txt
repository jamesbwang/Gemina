 To quantify the improvement in independence experienced by patients with the following diagnoses: Guillain-Barré Syndrome<GPE> ( GBS<ORGANIZATION> ), Multiple Sclerosis<PERSON> ( MS ), Parkinson Disease<PERSON> ( PD ), and stroke following inpatient rehabilitation. Subjects who were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in 2012-2013 with an incident diagnosis of: GBS ( n = 1079 ), MS ( n = 1438 ), PD<GPE> ( n = 11,834 ), or stroke ( n = 131,313 ) were included. The main outcome measure was improvement in Functional Independence<ORGANIZATION> Measure® ( FIM<ORGANIZATION> ) scores on self-care, mobility, and cognition during inpatient rehabilitation. We estimated percent improvement from a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for patients ' age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidity count, diagnostic group ( GBS<ORGANIZATION>, MS, PD<ORGANIZATION>, and stroke ), and admission score. All patient diagnostic groups receiving inpatient rehabilitation improved across all three domains. The largest adjusted percent improvements were observed in the mobility domain and the smallest in the cognition domain for all groups. Percent improvement in mobility ranged from 84.9 % ( MS ) to 144.0 % ( GBS<ORGANIZATION> ), self-care from 49.5 % ( MS ) to 84.1 % ( GBS<ORGANIZATION> ), and cognition from 34.0 % ( PD ) to 51.7 % ( GBS<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients with GBS<ORGANIZATION> demonstrated the greatest percent improvement across all three domains. Patients with GBS<ORGANIZATION>, MS, PD<ORGANIZATION>, and stroke should improve during inpatient rehabilitation but anticipated outcomes for patients with GBS<ORGANIZATION> should be even higher.
