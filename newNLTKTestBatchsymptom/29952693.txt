 Clinical<PERSON> Scenario<PERSON>: Cryotherapy is one of the most commonly used modalities for post-exercise muscle recovery despite inconsistencies in the literature validating its effectiveness. With the need to find a more effective modality, photobiomodulation therapy ( PBMT<ORGANIZATION> ) has gained popularity because of recent research demonstrating its ability to accelerate the muscle recovery process. Focused Clinical<PERSON> Question: Is PBMT<ORGANIZATION> more effective than cryotherapy at reducing recovery time and decreasing delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS<ORGANIZATION> ) after strenuous exercise ? Summary of Key<GPE> Findings: Three moderate- to high quality double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials and two low- to moderate quality translational studies performed on rats were included in this CAT<ORGANIZATION>. All 5 studies supported the use of PBMT<ORGANIZATION> over cryotherapy as a treatment for post-exercise muscle recovery following exercise. PBMT<ORGANIZATION> was superior in reducing creatine kinase, inflammation markers, and blood lactate compared to cryotherapy following strenuous/high intensity aerobic or strength muscular exercise. PBMT<ORGANIZATION> was also shown to improve post-exercise muscle performance and function more than cryotherapy. Clinical Bottom Line<PERSON>: There is moderate evidence to suggest the use of PBMT<ORGANIZATION> over cryotherapy post-exercise to enhance muscle recovery in trained and untrained athletes. Shorter recovery times and increased muscle performance can be seen 24 to 96 hours following PBMT<ORGANIZATION> application. Strength of Recommendation: Based on consistent findings from all 5 studies, there is grade B evidence to support the use of PBMT<ORGANIZATION> over cryotherapy for more effective post-exercise recovery of skeletal muscle performance.
