 Progressive movement of spermatozoa has conventionally been regarded as a good indicator of motility. However, bull spermatozoa exhibit two types of progressive movement: progressive/planar movement without rotation and progressive/helical movement with rotation. The aim of this study was to reconsider the evaluation criteria of bull ejaculated sperm motility in the context of rotation. Here, we compared the movement patterns of ejaculated spermatozoa with relatively high and low protein kinase A ( PKA<ORGANIZATION> ) -mediated signaling activities, because sperm motility is positively regulated by PKA-mediated signaling activities. We prepared sperm samples with high and low PKA-mediated signaling activities by suspending spermatozoa in media containing either the stimulator ( NaHCO<ORGANIZATION>
