 To determine the fat content of myxoid liposarcomas ( MLS<ORGANIZATION> ) on MRI<ORGANIZATION> and to identify any association between lipid content and survival. The fat percentage of MLS<ORGANIZATION> diagnosed between January 2006 and December 2016 at a single institution was assessed by two radiologists on preoperative MR images. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine any association between tumor fat percentage and survival time. Tumor<PERSON> fat percentage was the single predictor in the model. A significance level of 0.05 was used. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was also used to provide a nonparametric estimate of the survivor function within the entire sample and within two patient subgroups consists of lipid-rich and lipid-poor tumors. Lipid-rich tumors were defined as any tumors showing more than 20 % of fat on MRI<ORGANIZATION>. A 20 % cutoff was determined arbitrarily. Of the 43 cases identified through retrospective review, 8 tumors demonstrated ≥10 % fat on MRI<ORGANIZATION>, and 4 tumors demonstrated ≥20 % fat ( highest fat percentage, 38 % ). There was no significant survival difference between patients with high tumor fat, which was defined as ≥20 % fat, compared with those with little to no tumor fat. Myxoid<PERSON> liposarcomas may demonstrate a higher fat content on MRI<ORGANIZATION> than has previously been reported in the literature. Increased tumor fat percentage in lipid-rich tumors was not found to be associated with increased risk of death. Radiologists must be aware of the existence of MLS<ORGANIZATION> lesions with higher fat content.
