 Type<PERSON> II diabetes mellitus ( T2DM<ORGANIZATION> ) has consistently been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but the association of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM<ORGANIZATION> ) with breast cancer is less clear. T2DM<ORGANIZATION> and GDM<ORGANIZATION> may influence breast cancer risk through mammographic breast density, a strong risk factor for breast cancer. We examined whether T2DM<ORGANIZATION> and GDM<ORGANIZATION> are associated with higher mammographic breast density in a largely racial/ethnic minority sample. We collected digital mammograms, anthropometric measures, and interview data from 511 racially diverse women recruited during screening mammography appointments between 2012 and 2016 ( mean age 51 years ; 70 % Hispanic ). We examined the associations of self-reported GDM<ORGANIZATION>, T2DM<ORGANIZATION>, and medication use ( metformin and insulin ) with mammographic breast density, measured as percent and area of dense tissue using Cumulus<PERSON> software. In multivariable linear regression models, history of T2DM<ORGANIZATION> and/or GDM<ORGANIZATION> and length of time since diagnosis were not associated with percent density or dense breast area, either before or after adjustment for current BMI<ORGANIZATION>. Use of metformin in diabetic women was associated with lower percent density ( Î² = - 5.73, 95 % CI<ORGANIZATION> - 10.27, - 1.19 ), only before adjusting for BMI<ORGANIZATION>. These associations were not modified by menopausal status. Our results do not support associations between T2DM<ORGANIZATION> and/or GDM<ORGANIZATION> and higher amount of mammographically dense breast tissue, suggesting that the mechanism linking diabetes with breast cancer risk may not include mammographic breast density in midlife.
