 To determine the minimum clinically important difference ( MCID<ORGANIZATION> ) of the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test<ORGANIZATION> ( SNOT-22 ) in individuals undergoing medical management for their chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS<ORGANIZATION> ). Prospective observational study. Academic<PERSON>, tertiary care center. A total of 247 adults undergoing medical management for CRS<ORGANIZATION>. At enrollment, participants completed a SNOT-22. At a subsequent follow-up visit, two to twelve months after enrollment, participants also completed a SNOT-22. At follow-up, participants also rated the change in their sinus symptoms and general health as `` Much worse '', `` A little worse '', `` About the same '', `` A little better '' or `` Much better '' compared to enrollment ; these two questions were used as sinus symptom and general health anchor questions, respectively. The SNOT-22 MCID<ORGANIZATION> was calculated using distribution-based, anchor-based, and receiver operator characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve-based methods. Using the distribution-based method, the SNOT-22 MCID was 11.6. Using the sinus symptom anchor question, the SNOT-22 MCID was 10.5 ; applying the ROC<ORGANIZATION> method to the sinus symptom anchor yielded an MCID<ORGANIZATION> of 12.5. In comparison, using the general health anchor question, the SNOT-22 MCID was 8.3 ; applying the ROC<ORGANIZATION> method to the sinus symptom anchor yielded an MCID<ORGANIZATION> of 17.5. In all cases, the calculated MCID<ORGANIZATION> had a sensitivity of approximately 50-60 % and specificity of approximately 80-90 %. Based on our results, we propose a SNOT-22 MCID<ORGANIZATION> of 12 in medically managed CRS<ORGANIZATION> patients. The MCID<ORGANIZATION>, while specific, was not sensitive for identifying CRS<ORGANIZATION> patients experiencing a noticeable improvement in sinus symptoms or general health.
