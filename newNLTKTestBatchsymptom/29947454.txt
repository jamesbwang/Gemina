 Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests ( OHCA<ORGANIZATION> ) among infants or toddlers mainly occur at home. Therefore, parents with children should be able to perform immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR<ORGANIZATION> ) when they witness OHCA<ORGANIZATION>. However, the status of knowledge regarding CPR<ORGANIZATION> among parents remains unclear. The aim of our study was to determine the factors associated with awareness of CPR<ORGANIZATION> among parents with 3-year-old children. We analysed a subset of data from a population-based, cross-sectional survey that served as an evaluation of a national campaign for maternal and child health in Japan<GPE>. The questionnaire was distributed to 32,897 parents who visited public health centers for medical check-ups for their children in 2013. Demographic data for the study population were obtained and analysed via multivariate logistic regression analyses. Overall, 26,971 parents ( 82.0 % ) responded to the questionnaire. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that birth order of the child, age of the mother at delivery, awareness of medical facilities for emergency services at night or during the weekend, current occupational status of the mother, and current economic status were independently associated with CPR<ORGANIZATION> awareness. When the mother was employed but the parents felt economically insufficient, the probability of having CPR<ORGANIZATION> knowledge decreased by 19 %. Regardless of the parents ' economic stability, the probability of having CPR<ORGANIZATION> knowledge declined by > 35 % when the mother was unemployed. The current occupational status of mothers and the current economic status of families should be considered when planning educational strategies regarding CPR<ORGANIZATION> among parents.
