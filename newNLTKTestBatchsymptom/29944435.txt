 To investigate the use of electronic patient-reported outcomes ( PROs<ORGANIZATION> ) to assess symptoms and how they can provide opportunities to clinicians to address symptoms in a timely manner to improve clinical care. As part of a larger study to evaluate whether providing standardized symptom reports to the medical team would decrease the time to treatment of reported symptoms in hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients, we assessed nurses ' and providers ' perceptions of electronic symptom reporting. Semistructured interviews of RNs<ORGANIZATION>, MDs<ORGANIZATION>, NPs<ORGANIZATION> and PAs<ORGANIZATION> were conducted at an academic cancer center in the southeastern United States<GPE>. Nurses<PERSON> ' and providers ' perceptions of electronic symptom reporting were explored. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded by two investigators to identify major themes. Fourteen RNs<PERSON> and seven providers ( MDs<ORGANIZATION>, PAs<ORGANIZATION>, and NPs<ORGANIZATION> ) participated in the interviews. Three main themes emerged from the interviews: electronic symptom reporting may improve assessment and care, integrating symptom reporting into nurse workflow presents difficulties, and there are barriers for completion of surveys. The majority of nurses and providers believed that the inclusion of electronic symptom reporting in bone marrow transplantation inpatient units has the potential to improve care but that barriers to implementation remain.
