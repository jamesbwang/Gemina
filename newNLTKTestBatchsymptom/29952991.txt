 Low<PERSON> back pain ( LBP<ORGANIZATION> ) is a common complaint among patients presenting to emergency department ( ED ) in Singapore<GPE>. The STarT Back<ORGANIZATION> Screening Tool ( SBT<ORGANIZATION> ) was recently developed and validated for triage of LBP<ORGANIZATION> patients in primary care settings. This study aimed to investigate whether the SBT<ORGANIZATION> could provide prognostic information for long-term outcomes of acute LBP<ORGANIZATION> patients visiting the ED<ORGANIZATION>, who might benefit from appropriate and timely management at an earlier stage.Data were collected in a prospective observational cohort study from 177 patients who consulted emergency physicians for acute LBP<ORGANIZATION> and completed 6-month follow-up. Patients were administered the SBT<ORGANIZATION> and assessed at baseline. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 weeks and 6 months.A multiple linear regression model incorporating SBT<ORGANIZATION> total score, age, employment status, LBP<ORGANIZATION> history, and 6-week pain score was constructed to predict 6-month pain score. In the model, SBT<ORGANIZATION> total score and 6-week pain score were significantly associated with 6-month pain score ( P<PERSON> < .05 ) with respective coefficients of 0.125 and 0.500. The model explained 40.1 % of the variance for 6-month pain score.This study demonstrated that the multiple linear regression model showed predictive performance in determining long-term outcomes for acute LBP<ORGANIZATION> patients presenting to the ED<ORGANIZATION>.
