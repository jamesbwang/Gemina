 Life<GPE> in saline environments represents a major physiological challenge for birds, particularly for passerines that lack nasal salt glands and hence are forced to live in environments that do not contain salty resources. Increased energy costs associated with increased salt intake, which in turn increases the production of reactive oxygen species, is likely a major selection pressure for why passerines are largely absent from brackish and marine environments. Here we measured basal metabolic rates ( BMR<ORGANIZATION> ) and oxidative status of free-ranging individuals of three species of Cinclodes<GPE>, a group of passerine birds that inhabit marine and freshwater habitats in Chile<GPE>. We used a combination of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen isotope data from metabolically active ( blood ) and inert ( feathers ) tissues to estimate seasonal changes in marine resource use and infer altitudinal migration. Contrary to our expectations, the consumption of marine resources did not result in higher BMR<ORGANIZATION> values and higher oxidative stress. Specifically, the marine specialist C. nigrofumosus had lower BMR than the other two species ( C. fuscus and C. oustaleti ), which seasonally switch between terrestrial and marine resources. C. fuscus had significantly higher total antioxidant capacity than the other two species ( C. nigrofumosus and C. oustaleti ) that consumed a relatively high proportion of marine resources. Nearly all studies examining the effects of salt consumption have focused on intraspecific acclimation via controlled experiments in the laboratory. The mixed results obtained from field- and lab-based studies reflect our poor understanding of the mechanistic link among hydric-salt balance, BMR<ORGANIZATION>, and oxidative stress in birds.
