 Cognitive impairment is a common complication in patients with chronic neuropathic pain, without effective therapy. Recent works have indicated that curcumin ( Cur ) possesses antinociceptive and neuroprotective potentials, suggesting its possible effectiveness for the treatment of this complication. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of Cur<GPE> on pain behaviors and cognitive impairment in rats with cobra venom-induced trigeminal neuralgia ( TN ). This is a randomized, controlled experiment. This study was conducted at the Experimental Animal Center<ORGANIZATION>, Beijing<GPE> Friendship Hospital<ORGANIZATION>, Capital Medical University<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 40 adult male Sprague Dawley<PERSON> rats were used in this study. A cobra venom solution was injected into the sheath of infraorbital nerve. Cur<PERSON> was administered intragastrically at 45 mg/kg twice daily for 28 successive days from postoperative day 15. Mechanical allodynia was evaluated using von Frey filaments. Free behaviors were observed using video recording. Cognitive capacity was tested using the Morris<GPE> water maze. Both morphology and ultrastructure of the CA1<ORGANIZATION> hippocampal region were visualized using hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) staining and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Cur<PERSON> treatment reduced mechanical allodynia and face-grooming activities but increased exploratory activities and improved spatial learning and memory deficits. Microscopic<PERSON> examination revealed nucleus pyknosis, swollen organelles, and decreased synapse density in the CA1<ORGANIZATION> hippocampal region after cobra venom injection. However, chronic Cur treatment reversed damage to hippocampal neurons and synapses. Cur<PERSON> can alleviate pain, improve spatial learning and memory deficits, and restore the damage to hippocampal neurons and synapses in cobra venom-induced TN rats. Cur<PERSON> may be useful as an adjuvant to treat chronic neuropathic pain-induced cognitive deficits.
