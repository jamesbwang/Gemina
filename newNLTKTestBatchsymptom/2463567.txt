 A 64-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure secondary to nonischemic cardiomyopathy, mitral and aortic valve replacements, and biventricular cardioverter-defibrillator placement, developed a tachycardia. The tachycardia exhibited a biventricular paced rhythm with a short R-P interval and concentric atrial activation sequence within the coronary sinus, suggesting that the tachycardia might be a pacemaker-mediated tachycardia ( PMT<ORGANIZATION> ). However, the tachycardia was diagnosed as counterclockwise cavotricuspid isthmus ( CTI<ORGANIZATION> ) -dependent atrial flutter ( AFL<ORGANIZATION> ), and linear ablation of the CTI<ORGANIZATION> eliminated the tachycardia. This case illustrated that typical AFL can mimic a PMT when there is a severe conduction delay through the CTI<ORGANIZATION>.
