 Electro-responsive vesicles were demonstrated based on an amphiphilic block copolymer PEO114-b-P ( DCH-Ru ) n and an inorganic nanoparticle polyoxometalate H3PMo12O40<ORGANIZATION> ( PMo12<ORGANIZATION> ) via electrostatic interactions. After undergoing electrochemical reactions, vesicle membranes allow the migration of electrolyte ions and release of loaded cargos.
