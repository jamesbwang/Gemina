 The purpose of this study was to compare systemic inflammation in older women with a history of gestational diabetes ( GDM<ORGANIZATION> ) who developed impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT<ORGANIZATION> ) or type 2 diabetes ( T2DM<ORGANIZATION> ) to that in those with normal glucose tolerance ( NGT<ORGANIZATION> ) and to determine, in these women, the effect of weight loss ( WL ) induced by diet and exercise training on systemic inflammation and adipokine levels. This was a longitudinal clinical investigation of overweight/obese ( BMI<ORGANIZATION>: 32 Â± 1 kg/m
