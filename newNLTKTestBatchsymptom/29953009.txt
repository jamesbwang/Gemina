 Rhabdomyolysis owing to status epilepticus ( SE ) can be life-threating, with acute kidney injury ( AKI<ORGANIZATION> ) the most serious complication ; therefore, early recognition of the risk factors is important. Hyperuricemia after epileptic seizures has been reported, and severe hyperuricemia can lead to acute renal function damage. We present the case of a 21-year-old man hospitalized for SE<ORGANIZATION>, who had especially high level of blood uric acid ( UA ) at initial presentation. The patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis due to SE. The patient was treated with hydration and bicarbonate therapy. But he developed acute kidney failure ( AKF<ORGANIZATION> ) and hemodialysis was performed. After hemodialysis, his symptoms disappeared and laboratory data returned to normal. Hyperuricemia after SE<ORGANIZATION> might indicate severe muscle damage or reduced clearance of metabolites, and could be a risk factor for kidney dysfunction, especially with rhabdomyolysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of rhabdomyolysis following SE with hyperuricemia.
