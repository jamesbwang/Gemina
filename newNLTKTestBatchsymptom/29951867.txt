 Psychosomatic<GPE> symptoms and mental health problems are highly prevalent in multimorbid elderly people challenging general practitioners to differentiate between normal stress and psychopathological conditions. The 4DSQ is a Dutch<GPE> questionnaire developed to detect anxiety, depression, somatization, and distress in primary care. This study aims to analyze measurement equivalence between a German<GPE> version and the original Dutch<GPE> instrument. A Dutch<GPE> and a German<GPE> sample of multimorbid elderly people, matched by gender and age, were analyzed. Equivalence of scale structures was assessed by confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA<ORGANIZATION> ). To evaluate measurement equivalence across languages, differential item functioning ( DIF<ORGANIZATION> ) was analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel method and hybrid ordinal logistic regression analysis. Differential test functioning ( DTF<ORGANIZATION> ) was assessed using Rasch<PERSON> analysis. A total of 185 German<GPE> and 185 Dutch<GPE> participants completed the questionnaire. The CFA<ORGANIZATION> confirmed one-factor models for all scales of both 4DSQ versions. Nine items in three scales were flagged with DIF<ORGANIZATION>. The anxiety scale showed to be free of DIF<ORGANIZATION>. DTF<ORGANIZATION> analysis revealed negligible scale impact of DIF<ORGANIZATION>. The German 4DSQ demonstrated measurement equivalence to the original Dutch<GPE> instrument. Hence<PERSON>, it can be considered a valid questionnaire for the screening for mental health problems in primary care.
