 Previous evidence suggested that puerarin may attenuate cardiac hypertrophy ; however, the potential mechanisms were undetermined. Moreover, the use of puerarin is limited by severe adverse events, including intravascular hemolysis. This study used a rat model of abdominal aortic constriction ( AAC<ORGANIZATION> ) -induced cardiac hypertrophy to evaluate the potential mechanisms underlying the attenuating efficacy of puerarin on cardiac hypertrophy as well as the metabolic mechanisms of puerarin involved. We confirmed that puerarin ( 50 mg/kg/d ) significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy, upregulated Nrf2 and decreased Keap1<PERSON> in the myocardium. Moreover, puerarin significantly promoted Nrf2<PERSON> translocation to the nucleus in parallel with the upregulated downstream proteins including heme oxygenase-1, glutathione s-transferase p-1 and NAD<ORGANIZATION> ( P ) H: quinone oxidoreductase-1. Similar results were obtained in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes ( NRCMs<ORGANIZATION> ) treated with angiotensin II ( 1 μM ) and puerarin ( 100 μM ), while the silencing of Nrf2<PERSON> abolished the antihypertrophic effects of puerarin. The mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein levels of UGT1A1<ORGANIZATION> and UGT1A9<ORGANIZATION>, enzymes for puerarin metabolism, were significantly increased in the liver and heart tissues of AAC<ORGANIZATION> rats and angiotensin II-treated NRCMs. Interestingly, the silencing of Nrf2<PERSON> attenuated the puerarin-induced upregulation of UGT1A1<ORGANIZATION> and UGT1A9<ORGANIZATION>. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR indicated that the binding of Nrf2<GPE> to the promoter region of UGT1A1<ORGANIZATION> or UGT1A9<ORGANIZATION> was significantly enhanced in puerarin-treated cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that Nrf2<PERSON> is the key regulator of antihypertrophic effects and the upregulation of the metabolic enzymes UGT1A1<ORGANIZATION> and UGT1A9<ORGANIZATION> of puerarin. This autoregulatory circuits between puerarin and Nrf2-induced UGT1A1/1A9 are beneficial to attenuate adverse effects and maintain the pharmacological effects of puerarin.
