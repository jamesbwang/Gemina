 This research investigated controller ' situation awareness by comparing COOPANS<ORGANIZATION> 's acoustic alerts with newly designed semantic alerts. The results demonstrate that ATCOs<ORGANIZATION> ' visual scan patterns had significant differences between acoustic and semantic designs. ATCOs<ORGANIZATION> established different eye movement patterns on fixations number, fixation duration and saccade velocity. Effective decision support systems require human-centred design with effective stimuli to direct ATCO<ORGANIZATION> 's attention to critical events. It is necessary to provide ATCOs<ORGANIZATION> with specific alerting information to reflect the nature of of the critical situation in order to minimize the side-effects of startle and inattentional deafness. Consequently, the design of a semantic alert can significantly reduce ATCOs<ORGANIZATION> ' response time, therefore providing valuable extra time in a time-limited situation to formulate and execute resolution strategies in critical air safety events. The findings of this research indicate that the context-specified design of semantic alerts could improve ATCO<ORGANIZATION> 's situational awareness and significantly reduce response time in the event of Short Term Conflict Alert<ORGANIZATION> activation which alerts to two aircraft having less than the required lateral or vertical separation.
