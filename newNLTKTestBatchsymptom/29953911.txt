 To determine if there are any changes in brain metastases or resection cavity volumes between planning magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) and radiosurgical ( RS ) treatment and if these led to a change in management or alteration in the RS<ORGANIZATION> plan. Patients undergoing RS<ORGANIZATION> for brain metastasis or tumor resection cavities had a standardized planning MRI<ORGANIZATION> ( MRI-1 ) performed and a repeat verification MRI<ORGANIZATION> ( MRI-2 ) 24 hours prior to RS. Any change in management, including re-planning based on MRI-2 was recorded. 34 patients with a total of 59 lesions ( 44 metastases and 15 tumor resection cavities ) were assessed with a median time between MRI-1 and MRI-2 of 7 days. 17 patients ( 50 % ) required a change in management based on the changes seen on MRI-2. For patients with 7 days or less between scans, 41 % of patients ( 9/22 ) required a change in management, whereas for patients with 8 days or more between scans 78 % ( 7/9 ) of patients required this. Per<PERSON> lesion, 32 out of 59 lesions required re-planning, including 7/15 ( 47 % ) cavities and 25/44 ( 57 % ) metastases, with the most common reason ( 23 lesions ) being an increase in gross target volume ( tumor ) or clinical target volume ( tumor cavity ). Measurable changes occur in brain metastasis over a short amount of time with a change in management required in 41 % of patients with 7 days between MRI-1 and MRI-2, and 78 % of patients when there is a delay longer than 7 days. We therefore recommend that the time between planning MRI<ORGANIZATION> and radiosurgical treatment is as short as possible.
