 Exercise<GPE> reduces sympathetic activity ( SA ), arterial pressure and heart rate in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR<ORGANIZATION> ). Exercise increases oxidative stress ( OS ) and inflammation is implicated in the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ) and progression of hypertension. To unravel these effects of exercise and considering that SA is driven by medullary areas, we hypothesized that swimming exercise ( SW ) affects the gene expression ( g.e. ) of proteins involved in inflammation and OS in the commissural Nucleus of the Solitary Tract<ORGANIZATION> ( cNTS<ORGANIZATION> ) and Rostral<ORGANIZATION> ventrolateral medulla ( RVLM<ORGANIZATION> ), which control the sympathetic outflow in SHR<ORGANIZATION>. We used male SHR<ORGANIZATION> and Wistar<GPE> rats ( 14-16wks-old ) which were maintained sedentary ( SED<ORGANIZATION> ) or submitted to SW<GPE> ( 1 h/day, 5 days/wk./6wks ). The g.e. of cycloxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ), interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ), interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ), AT-1 receptor ( AT-1r ), neuroglobin ( Ngb ) and cytoglobin ( Ctb ) in cNTS<ORGANIZATION> and RVLM<ORGANIZATION> was carried out by qPCR<ORGANIZATION>. We observed that COX-2 g.e. increased in SW-SHR in cNTS<ORGANIZATION> and RVLM<ORGANIZATION> compared to SED-SHR. The IL-6 g.e. reduced in RVLM<ORGANIZATION> in SW-SHR<GPE>, whereas IL-10 g.e. increased in SW-SHR in comparison to SED-SHR. The AT-1r g.e. decreased in SW-SHR in cNTS<ORGANIZATION> and RVLM<ORGANIZATION> compared to SED-SHR. The Ngb<ORGANIZATION> and Ctb<ORGANIZATION> g.e. in cNTS<ORGANIZATION> neurons increased in SHR<ORGANIZATION> and Wistar<GPE> rats submitted to SW compared to SED<ORGANIZATION>, but only Ctb g.e. increased in RVLM<ORGANIZATION> in SW-SHR and Wistar<GPE> in comparison to SED<ORGANIZATION>. Therefore, the SW<ORGANIZATION> altered the g.e. in cNTS<ORGANIZATION> and RVLM<ORGANIZATION> for reducing the inflammation and ROS<ORGANIZATION> formation, which is increased particularly in SHR<ORGANIZATION>, consequently decreasing the OS<ORGANIZATION>.
