 Carboxyl-terminal modulator protein ( CTMP<ORGANIZATION> ) has been implicated in cancer, brain injury, and obesity. However, the role of CTMP<ORGANIZATION> in pathological cardiac hypertrophy has not been identified. In this study, decreased expression of CTMP<ORGANIZATION> was observed in both human failing hearts and murine hypertrophied hearts. To further explore the potential involvement of CTMP<ORGANIZATION> in pathological cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac-specific CTMP<ORGANIZATION> knockout and overexpression mice were generated. In vivo experiments revealed that CTMP<ORGANIZATION> deficiency exacerbated the cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and function induced by pressure overload, whereas CTMP<ORGANIZATION> overexpression alleviated the response to hypertrophic stimuli. Consistent with the in vivo results, adenovirus-mediated gain-of-function or loss-of-function experiments showed that CTMP<ORGANIZATION> also exerted a protective effect against hypertrophic responses to angiotensin II in vitro. Mechanistically<PERSON>, CTMP<ORGANIZATION> ameliorated pathological cardiac hypertrophy through the blockade of the protein kinase B signaling pathway. Moreover, inhibition of protein kinase B activation with LY294002<ORGANIZATION> rescued the deteriorated effect in aortic banding-treated cardiac-specific CTMP<ORGANIZATION> knockout mice. Taken together, these findings imply, for the first time, that increasing the cardiac expression of CTMP<ORGANIZATION> may be a novel therapeutic strategy for pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
