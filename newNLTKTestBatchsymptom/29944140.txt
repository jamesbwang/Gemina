 Dormant or slow-cycling tumour cells can form a residual chemoresistant reservoir responsible for relapse in patients, years after curative surgery and adjuvant therapy. We have adapted the pulse-chase expression of H2BeGFP<ORGANIZATION> for labelling and isolating slow-cycling cancer cells ( SCCC<ORGANIZATION> ). SCCC<ORGANIZATION> showed cancer-initiation potential and enhanced chemoresistance. Cells at this slow-cycling status presented a distinctive non-genetic and cell-autonomous gene expression profile shared across different tumour types. We identified TET2<ORGANIZATION> epigenetic enzyme as key factor controlling SCCC<ORGANIZATION> numbers, survival and tumour recurrence. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ), generated by TET2<ORGANIZATION> enzymatic activity, labelled SCCC<ORGANIZATION> genome in carcinomas and was a predictive biomarker of relapse and survival in cancer patients. We have shown the enhanced chemoresistance of SCCC<ORGANIZATION>, revealed 5hmC as a biomarker for their clinical identification, and TET2<ORGANIZATION> as a potential drug-target for SCCC<ORGANIZATION> elimination that could extend patients ' survival.
