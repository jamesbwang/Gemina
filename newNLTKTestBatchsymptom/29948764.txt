 Introduction The prevalence of pediatric obesity is an issue in the United States<GPE>, in which approximately one-third of children and adolescents are overweight or obese. Youth living in low socioeconomic ( SES<ORGANIZATION> ) households are at an increased risk for developing obesity ; yet, research is needed to understand the mechanisms that might better explain the relationship between SES<ORGANIZATION> and obesity risk. Maternal depression presents a potential mechanism by which SES<ORGANIZATION> might predict a later risk for obesity in pediatric populations. Methods The present study used a national dataset from the National Institute<ORGANIZATION> of Child<GPE> Health and Human<PERSON> Development-Study of Early Child Care<PERSON> and Youth Development<PERSON> ( NICHD-SECCYD ) to examine whether maternal depressive symptoms ( at an age of 9 years ) mediated the association between early SES ( the income-to-needs ratio measured at an age of 1 month ) and adolescent weight outcomes [ Body Mass Index<PERSON> z-scores ( zBMI<ORGANIZATION> ) for age and sex, at an age of 15 years ]. Results The results suggested that greater maternal depressive symptoms helped to explain a significant amount of the variance of lower SES predicting poorer weight outcomes in adolescents. Discussion These findings illustrate the role of maternal depressive symptoms in explaining how SES<ORGANIZATION> predicts adolescent weight outcomes. Implications are discussed, and future research is needed to identify women from lower SES<ORGANIZATION> households who are experiencing depressive symptoms to provide support and initiate points of early intervention to address relevant health outcomes in youths.
