 Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) examining warfarin use for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation ( AF ) may not accurately reflect real-world populations. We aimed to determine the representativeness of the RCT<ORGANIZATION> populations to real-world patients and to describe differences in the characteristics of trial populations from trial eligible patients in a real-world setting. We hypothesized that a significant fraction of real-world patients would not qualify for the RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, and ARISTOTLE<ORGANIZATION> trials and that real-world patients qualifying for the studies may have more strokes and bleeding events. We compared the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes from RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, and ARISTOTLE<ORGANIZATION> against data from the Michigan Anticoagulation Quality<ORGANIZATION> Improvement Initiative ( MAQI<ORGANIZATION>
