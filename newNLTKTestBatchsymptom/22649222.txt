 In recent years, a large number of studies have investigated obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD<ORGANIZATION> ) using diffusion-weighted images ( DWIs<ORGANIZATION> ) and have reported microstructural abnormalities in various regions, mainly the corpus callosum and cingulum. In the present study, we aimed to detect microstructural changes in the white matter using whole-brain tractography. We obtained MRI<ORGANIZATION> data from 25 adult non-medicated OCD<ORGANIZATION> patients and 27 healthy controls. DWI<ORGANIZATION> data from MRI<ORGANIZATION> scans were analyzed by the automated probabilistic tractography method referred to as TRActs<ORGANIZATION> Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy<GPE> ( TRACULA<ORGANIZATION> ). We investigated diffusivity parameters: fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity ( RD ), axial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity in 18 major white matter tracts and examined indices to know which measurements in which fibers can predict the diagnosis of OCD<ORGANIZATION>. Compared to healthy controls, OCD<ORGANIZATION> patients had significantly increased RD in the forceps major and a reduction of RD in the right cingulum angular ( infracallosal ) bundle. There was no correlation between these values and the clinical features. We found RD<ORGANIZATION> alterations in the forceps major and the right cingulum angular ( infracallosal ) bundle, which might be associated with myelination changes in the temporal and occipital regions in OCD<ORGANIZATION>. Our results suggest that the pathogenesis of OCD<ORGANIZATION> may include abonormality of myelination status in not only the fronto-striato-thalamic circuit but also the posterior and temporal regions.
