 This study aimed to analyze the isolated role of unsupported arm activities and the physiological responses and dynamic hyperinflation ( DH ) induced by activities of daily living in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Physiological responses and DH were compared using the Glittre<ORGANIZATION> activities of daily living test ( TGlittre<ORGANIZATION> ) and a modified protocol that emphasized unsupported arm activities and excluded squats and bending down to move objects on shelves ( TGlittre-M ). Data were also compared from the isolated shelf tasks of TGlittre<ORGANIZATION> ( TSHELF<ORGANIZATION> ) and TGlittre-M ( TSHELF-M ). This cross-sectional study included 30 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who performed the TGlittre<ORGANIZATION>, TGlittre-M, TSHELF<ORGANIZATION> and TSHELF-M. The physiological responses were evaluated during the 4 protocols and inspiratory capacity was measured before and immediately after the tests for evaluation of DH<ORGANIZATION>. Patients<PERSON> had higher oxygen uptake, ventilatory demand, dyspnea, and DH in the TGlittre<ORGANIZATION> than in the TGlittre-M ( mean differences: 123 ± 119 mL/min ; 0.11 ± 0.10, 1 [ -1 to 3 ], and - 0.14 ± 0.22, respectively ; P<PERSON> < .05 for all ). Oxygen<PERSON> uptake, ventilatory demand, and dyspnea were also higher in the TSHELF<ORGANIZATION> than in the TSHELF-M ( mean differences: 408 ± 185 mL/min ; 0.26 ± 0.17 ; 1 [ -1 to 3 ], respectively ; P<PERSON> < .05 for all ). However, DH<ORGANIZATION> was similar for both tasks ( P<PERSON> > .05 ). In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the physiological demands during unsupported arm activities were lower than during the task performed with squatting and bending down ; however, the magnitude of DH<ORGANIZATION> did not differ between them. These results suggest that the isolated arm activities contribute less to the TGlittre<ORGANIZATION> 's physiological requirement than the lower-limb and trunk activities.
