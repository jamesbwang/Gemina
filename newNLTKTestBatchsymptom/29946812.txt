 Purpose The Work Rehabilitation Questionnaire<ORGANIZATION> ( WORQ<ORGANIZATION> ) is a patient-reported instrument to assess work related functioning in vocational rehabilitation ( VR ) and work, based on the International Classification<ORGANIZATION> of Functioning<GPE>, Disability<ORGANIZATION> and Health<GPE> ( ICF<ORGANIZATION> ) core set for VR<ORGANIZATION>. The objective of this study was to cross-culturally adapt WORQ<ORGANIZATION> to French<GPE> and to evaluate its psychometric properties. Methods The cross-cultural adaptation followed a dual-panel approach. Psychometrics was examined in one VR-centre in the French<GPE> speaking part of Switzerland<GPE>. Test-retest reliability was analyzed with intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC<ORGANIZATION> ), internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach<PERSON> 's alpha. Construct validity was determined by convergence to the self-reported general functioning scale and the Hospital Anxiety<ORGANIZATION> and Depression Scales<ORGANIZATION> ( HADS<ORGANIZATION> ). The association of patient 's return-to-work expectation within 6-months and having a case manager was examined. The usability of WORQ-French was tested in 10 VR patients. Results Eighty-nine patients with musculoskeletal injuries were included. WORQ-French showed excellent internal consistency ( 0.968 ) and a high test-retest reliability ( 0.935 ). WORQ-French was positively associated with self-reported general functioning ( r = 0.662 ) and both HADS<ORGANIZATION> scales ( r = 0.56-0.57 ). Neither the patient 's return-to-work expectation nor having a case manager were significantly correlated with WORQ-French. Usability in terms of understandability of questions and response options was found to be good. Seven patients rated the length of WORQ-French as good, while two found the instrument a little too long and one found it too long. Conclusions WORQ French<ORGANIZATION> is a valid, reliable, and easy to administer instrument to assess self-reported work functioning given our study setting and sample characteristics.
