 The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether noninvasive ventilation ( NIV<ORGANIZATION> ) can positively affect exercise capacity, maximum oxygen uptake ( 47 subjects with COPD<ORGANIZATION> who were enrolled in a physical training program were randomized to either physical training alone or NIV<ORGANIZATION> + physical training ( NIV-Physical training ). Physical training consisted of dynamic aerobic exercises on a treadmill 3 times/week for 6 weeks, for a total of 18 sessions. NIV<ORGANIZATION> was titrated according to the subject 's tolerance at rest and during exercise. Assessments included physiological responses and symptoms at the incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test peak and during submaximal exercise on a treadmill, 6-min walk distance, maximum inspiratory ( P 43 subjects completed the 6-week physical training program. Both groups improved 6-min walk distance, P<PERSON> A 6-week physical training program alone can improve tolerance for exercise and quality of life, in addition to reducing the risk of mortality. However, NIV<ORGANIZATION> associated with a physical training program was shown to have an additive beneficial effect on powerful prognostic markers ( maximum VÌ‡
