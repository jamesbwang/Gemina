 In this study, a slurry photocatalytic membrane reactor ( PMR<ORGANIZATION> ) was developed and evaluated for the degradation of aqueous phenanthrene ( PHE<ORGANIZATION> ). During continuous process with a hydraulic retention time ( HRT<ORGANIZATION> ) of 140 min, the maximum PHE<ORGANIZATION> degradation and total organic carbon ( TOC<ORGANIZATION> ) removal efficiencies were found to be 97 % and 79 %, respectively. The reuse and recovery potential of TiO<ORGANIZATION>
