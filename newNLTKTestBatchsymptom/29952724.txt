 Self-injurious behaviours ( SIB<ORGANIZATION> ) continue to afflict a significant segment of the clinical and general population, sometimes with fatal consequences. The development of SIB<ORGANIZATION> seems to share developmental pathways and mechanisms similar to attachment insecurity. To date, no reviews have explored their relationship. A search of publication databases PubMed<ORGANIZATION> and PsychInfo<ORGANIZATION> from 1969 through April 2018 was conducted. 17 papers met inclusion criteria. Of the 17 articles identified, 13 reported a positive relationship and 1 reported a negative relationship between attachment insecurity and SIB<ORGANIZATION>. Both attachment anxiety and avoidance seem to play a role in the risk for SIB<ORGANIZATION>, possibly through different mechanisms and likely with different impacts on the choice for either self-harm or suicide attempts.
