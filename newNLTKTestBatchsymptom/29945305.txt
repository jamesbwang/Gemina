 Factors that patients value when choosing a transplant center have not been well studied. In order to guide the improvement of patient-facing materials, we conducted an anonymous electronic survey of National Kidney Foundation Patient Panel<ORGANIZATION> members that assessed relative importance of patient experience, practical considerations, transplant center reputation, center experience, and waitlist when selecting a transplant center. 409 respondents completed the survey, of whom 68 % were kidney transplant recipients and 32 % had chronic kidney disease or were on dialysis ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ). Participants<PERSON> had mean age 56Â±12 years and were predominantly female ( 61 % ), white ( 79 % ), and had an associate 's degree or higher ( 68 % ). Participants most often prioritized waitlist when evaluating transplant centers ( transplanted 26 %, CKD<ORGANIZATION> 40 % ), and waitlist was almost twice as likely as outcomes to be ranked most important ( 30 % vs 17 % ). Education level and transplant status were significantly associated with center prioritization. Waitlisted respondents most commonly ( 48 % ) relied on physicians for information when selecting a center, while a minority cited transplant-specific organizations. In order to improve shared decision-making, materials outlining center-specific waitlist features should be prioritized. Novel<PERSON> patient-oriented metrics for measuring transplant center quality that align with patient priorities must be explored. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
