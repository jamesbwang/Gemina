 Prognostication of coma patients after brain injury is important, yet challenging. In this study, we evaluated the predictive value of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography ( aEEG<ORGANIZATION> ) for neurological outcomes in coma patients. From January 2013 to January 2016, 128 coma patients after acute brain injury were prospectively enrolled and monitored with aEEG<ORGANIZATION>. The 6-month neurological outcome was evaluated using the Cerebral Performance Category Scale<ORGANIZATION>. aEEG<ORGANIZATION> monitoring commenced at a median of 7.5 days after coma onset. Continuous normal voltage predicted a good 6-month neurological outcome with a sensitivity of 93.6 % and specificity of 85.2 %. In contrast, continuous extremely low voltage, burst-suppression, or a flat tracing was correlated with poor 6-month neurological outcome with a sensitivity of 76.5 % and specificity of 100 %. In conclusion, aEEG<ORGANIZATION> is a promising predictor of 6-month neurological outcome for coma patients after acute brain injury.
