 Analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication ( AAIM<ORGANIZATION> ) increases the risk of medical complications during endurance races. We determined how many runners use AAIM<ORGANIZATION> before or during races, AAIM<ORGANIZATION> types, and factors associated with AAIM<ORGANIZATION> use. Cross-sectional study. 21.1-km and 56-km races. Seventy-six thousand six hundred fifty-four race entrants. Participants<PERSON> completed pre-race medical screening questions on AAIM<ORGANIZATION> use, running injury or exercise-associated muscle cramping ( EAMC<ORGANIZATION> ) history, and general medical history. Analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication use, types of AAIM<ORGANIZATION> ( % runners ; 95 % confidence interval ), and factors associated with AAIM<ORGANIZATION> use ( sex, age, race distance, history of running injury or EAMC<ORGANIZATION>, and history of chronic diseases ) [ prevalence ratio ( PR ) ]. Overall, 12.2 % ( 12.0-12.5 ) runners used AAIM<ORGANIZATION> 1 week before and/or during races ( 56 km = 18.6 % ; 18.0-19.1, 21.1 km = 8.3 % ; 8.1-8.6 ) ( P<PERSON> < 0.0001 ). During races, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs<ORGANIZATION> ) ( 5.3 % ; 5.1-5.5 ) and paracetamol ( 2.6 % ; 2.4-2.7 ) were used mostly. Independent factors ( adjusted PR<ORGANIZATION> for sex, age, and race distance ; P<PERSON> < 0.0001 ) associated with AAIM<ORGANIZATION> use were running injury ( 2.7 ; 2.6-2.9 ), EAMC<ORGANIZATION> ( 2.0 ; 1.9-2.1 ), cardiovascular disease ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ) symptoms ( 2.1 ; 1.8-2.4 ), known CVD<ORGANIZATION> ( 1.7 ; 1.5-1.9 ), CVD<ORGANIZATION> risk factors ( 1.6 ; 1.5-1.6 ), allergies ( 1.6 ; 1.5-1.7 ), cancer ( 1.3 ; 1.1-1.5 ), and respiratory ( 1.7 ; 1.6-1.8 ), gastrointestinal ( 2.0 ; 1.9-2.2 ), nervous system ( 1.9 ; 1.7-2.1 ), kidney/bladder ( 1.8 ; 1.6-2.0 ), endocrine ( 1.5 ; 1.4-1.7 ), and hematological/immune ( 1.5 ; 1.2-1.8 ) diseases. 12.2 % runners use AAIM<ORGANIZATION> before and/or during races, mostly NSAIDs<ORGANIZATION>. Factors ( independent of sex, age, and race distance ) associated with AAIM<ORGANIZATION> use were history of injuries, EAMC<ORGANIZATION>, and numerous chronic diseases. We suggest a pre-race screening and educational program to reduce AAIM<ORGANIZATION> use in endurance athletes to promote safer races.
