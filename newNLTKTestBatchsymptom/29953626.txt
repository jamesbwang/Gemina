 Symptoms of depression negatively impact on mother-infant relationships and child outcomes. We evaluated a novel, 10-session mother-infant therapeutic playgroup-Community HUGS<ORGANIZATION> ( CHUGS<ORGANIZATION> ) -which combines cognitive and experiential components through psychoeducation, play, music, and movement. Participants were mothers experiencing a range of postnatal mental health difficulties, including depression, with infants â‰¤12 months of age. However, the aim was not to treat maternal depression but to ameliorate associated problems in the mother-infant interaction. In the feasibility study, all participants received CHUGS<ORGANIZATION>. In the pilot randomized controlled trial ( RCT<ORGANIZATION> ), participants were randomized between intervention and a wait-list. Outcomes were the Parenting Stress Index<ORGANIZATION> ( PSI<ORGANIZATION> ; R.R. Abidin<PERSON>, 1995 ), Parenting Sense of Competency Scale<ORGANIZATION> ( Self-Efficacy subscale ; J. Gibaud-Wallston & L.P. Wandersman, 1978 ), and the Depression, Anxiety<PERSON>, Stress Scales<PERSON> ( P.F. Lovibond & S.H. Lovibond<PERSON>, 1995 ). In the feasibility study ( n = 74 ), PSI<ORGANIZATION> scores dropped on all subscales, all ps < .01. Depression, p < .001, anxiety, p = .01, stress, p = .01, and self-efficacy, p < .001, all showed improvements, as did observer-rated mother-infant interactions, p < .001. In the RCT<ORGANIZATION>, depression, p < .001, anxiety, p = .005, and stress, p < .001, symptoms were significantly reduced for intervention participants ( n = 16 ), as compared to wait-list participants ( n = 15 ). The CHUGS<ORGANIZATION> program had high participant satisfaction and produced improvements in self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, stress, and mother-infant interactions that supported the program 's acceptability and the utility of further rollout.
