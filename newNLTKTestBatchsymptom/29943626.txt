 Background<PERSON> Insulin<ORGANIZATION> is involved in a glucose homeostatic regulation and a cellular metabolism via phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K<ORGANIZATION> ) pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK<ORGANIZATION> ) pathway. Hyperinsulinemia<PERSON> reduces insulin sensitivity and is an obvious potential factor affecting airway inflammation in chronic airway diseases. MUC5AC<ORGANIZATION> is a major secreted mucin, which plays a critical role in inflammatory response in the respiratory tract. However, the relationship between insulin and MUC5AC<ORGANIZATION> expression has not been studied. Objective This study investigated the effect and the brief signaling pathway of high concentration of insulin ( HI ) on MUC5AC<ORGANIZATION> expression in human airway epithelial cell. Methods In NCI-H292 cells and primary cultures of normal nasal epithelial cells, the effect and signaling pathway of HI<ORGANIZATION> on MUC5AC<ORGANIZATION> expression were investigated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ), real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION>, enzyme immunoassay, and immunoblot analysis with several specific inhibitors and small interfering RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( siRNA<ORGANIZATION> ). Results HI<PERSON> significantly increased MUC5AC<ORGANIZATION> expression and activated PI3K/AKT, extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) and p38 MAPKs<ORGANIZATION>. The specific PI3K<ORGANIZATION> and AKT<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor as well as knockdown of AKT1<ORGANIZATION> and AKT2<ORGANIZATION> by the respective siRNAs<ORGANIZATION> significantly blocked HI-mediated expression of MUC5AC<ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, the specific ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor as well as knockdown of ERK1<ORGANIZATION>, ERK2<ORGANIZATION>, and p38 MAPK by the respective siRNAs<ORGANIZATION> also attenuated HI-induced expression of MUC5AC<ORGANIZATION>. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that HI<ORGANIZATION> induces MUC5AC<ORGANIZATION> expression via PI3K/AKT and MAPK<ORGANIZATION> signaling pathways in human airway epithelial cells.
