 The rational design of concentration-gradient ( CG- ) structure is demonstrated as an available approach to improve the electrochemical performances of high-energy nickel-rich cathodes for lithium-ion batteries ( LIBs<ORGANIZATION> ). However, the complicated preparing processes, especially the CG-precursors, generally result in the less-than-ideal repeatability and consistency that is regarded as an extremely challenge for the widespread commercialization. Thus, the innovative strategy with facile steps and the feasibility of large-scale preparation for commercialized applications should be urgently developed. Herein<PERSON>, through the temperature-tunable cations diffusion, the feasibility of controllable preparation of nickel-rich CG-LiNi0.7Co0.15Mn0.15O2 ( NCM<ORGANIZATION> ) from multi-shell precursors is first demonstrated. As expected, the Li/CG-NCM half-cells show much enhanced cycle-life, rate property and safety due to the mitigated side-reactions and fast Li+ kinetics. Besides, the Li4Ti5O12/CG-NCM full-cells also exhibit long-term lifespan, 95 % capacity retention even after 2000 cycles, and high-rate behaviors. Importantly, by contrast with the conventional techniques that prepare CG-cathodes from CG-precursors, the proposed new synthesis strategy from multi-shell precursors is suitable for large-scale preparation. Overall, this multi-shell precursor facilitated synthesis probably promotes the practical applications of CG-cathodes for state-of-the-art LIBs<ORGANIZATION>, and also can be easily expanded to controllably preparing spinel- and olive-type CG-cathodes.
