 Recombinant PRRSV<ORGANIZATION> △2ORF5 gene was constructed using DNA<ORGANIZATION> shuffling from four genetically different strains of PRRSV<ORGANIZATION> to study its heterologous cross-neutralizing ability. The △2ORF5 mutant gene was cloned into the vector pET-32a and transferred into E. coli BL21<ORGANIZATION>. SDS-PAGE confirmed that the molecular weight of the recombinant △2ORF5 was about 42 kDa, consistent with the predicted result. Then the purified recombinant protein was injected into BALB/c mouse to obtain polyclonal antibody. Western blotting analysis with mouse-anti-△2ORF5 polyclonal serum indicated that the parental virus recombinant GP5<ORGANIZATION> protein reacted with the specific antibodies. Four parental viruses could be inhibited by the anti-△2ORF5 polyclonal antibody and the inhibition rates were higher than 53 %. This work has laid a foundation for further development vaccine for PRRSV<ORGANIZATION>.
