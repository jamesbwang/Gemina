 To evaluate case series studies that quantitatively assess the effects of catheter-directed thrombolysis ( CDT<ORGANIZATION> ) and compare the efficacy of CDT<ORGANIZATION> and anticoagulation in patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis ( DVT<ORGANIZATION> ). Relevant databases, including PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Embase<GPE>, Cochrane<GPE>, Ovid MEDLINE<PERSON> and Scopus<GPE>, were searched through January 2017. The inclusion criteria were applied to select patients with acute lower extremity DVT<ORGANIZATION> treated with CDT<ORGANIZATION> or with anticoagulation. In the case series studies, the pooled estimates of efficacy outcomes for patency rate, complete lysis, rethrombosis and post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS<ORGANIZATION> ) were calculated across the studies. In studies comparing CDT<ORGANIZATION> with anticoagulation, summary odds ratios ( ORs<ORGANIZATION> ) were calculated. Twenty-five articles ( six comparing CDT<ORGANIZATION> with anticoagulation and 19 case series ) including 2254 patients met the eligibility criteria. In the case series studies, the pooled results were a patency rate of 0.87 ( 95 % CI: 0.85-0.89 ), complete lysis 0.58 ( 95 % CI: 0.40-0.75 ), rethrombosis 0.11 ( 95 % CI: 0.06-0.17 ) and PTS 0.10 ( 95 % CI: 0.08-0.12 ). Six studies comparing the efficacy outcomes of CDT<ORGANIZATION> and anticoagulation showed that CDT<ORGANIZATION> was associated with a reduction of PTS<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 0.38, 95 % CI 0.26-0.55, p < 0.0001 ) and a higher patency rate ( OR 4.76, 95 % CI 2.14-10.56, p < 0.0001 ). Acute<PERSON> lower extremity DVT<ORGANIZATION> patients receiving CDT<ORGANIZATION> were found to have a lower incidence of PTS<ORGANIZATION> and a higher incidence of patency rate. In our meta-analysis, CDT<ORGANIZATION> is shown to be an effective treatment for acute lower extremity DVT<ORGANIZATION> patients.
