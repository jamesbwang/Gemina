 Neurocognitive dysfunction and brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) are common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE<ORGANIZATION> ) and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, brain MRI<ORGANIZATION> is expensive, is restricted by payers, and requires high expertise. Neurocognitive assessment is an easily available, safe, and inexpensive clinical tool that may select patients needing brain MRI<ORGANIZATION>. In this cross-sectional and controlled study, 76 SLE patients ( 69 women, age 37 ± 12 years ) and 26 age and gender-matched healthy subjects ( 22 women, age 34 ± 11 years ) underwent assessment of attention, memory, processing speed, executive function, motor function, and global neurocognitive function. All subjects underwent brain MRI<ORGANIZATION> with T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR<ORGANIZATION> ), and diffusion-weighted imaging.
