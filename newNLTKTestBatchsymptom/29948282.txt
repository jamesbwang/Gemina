 The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of calcium hydroxide ( Ca [ OH ] A total of 60 patients were randomly divided into two groups that were to receive different medications. Pre-and post-treatment samples were collected from the interstitial fluid of periapical lesions using sterile paper points. VIP<ORGANIZATION> and MMP-9 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, and the data were statistically analyzed. Gender<PERSON> and smoking habits had no effect on the pre- and post-treatment VIP<ORGANIZATION> and MMPs<ORGANIZATION> levels. Intragroup<ORGANIZATION> analyses revealed that in the Ca ( OH ) According to the results of the present study, the type of the medication affected the amount of periapical VIP<ORGANIZATION> and MMP-9 secretion. VIP<ORGANIZATION> is a neuropeptide that promotes new bone formation. Thus, intracanal Ca ( OH )
