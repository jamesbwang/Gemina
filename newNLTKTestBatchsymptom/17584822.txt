 Endometriosis<GPE> is a chronic benign disease that affects women of reproductive age. Medical<PERSON> therapy is often the first line of management for women with endometriosis in order to ameliorate symptoms or to prevent post-surgical disease recurrence. Currently, there are several medical options for the management of patients with endometriosis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs<ORGANIZATION> ) are widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, being efficacious in relieving primary dysmenorrhea. Combined oral contraceptives ( COCs<ORGANIZATION> ) and progestins, available for multiple routes of administration, are effective first-line hormonal options. In fact, several randomized controlled trials ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) demonstrated that they succeed in improving pain symptoms in the majority of patients, are well tolerated and not expensive. Second-line therapy is represented by gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH<ORGANIZATION> ) agonists. Even if these drugs are efficacious in treating women not responding to COCs<ORGANIZATION> or progestins, they are not orally available and have a less favorable tolerability profile ( needing an appropriate add-back therapy ). The use of danazol is limited by the large availability of other better-tolerated hormonal drugs. Because few data are available on long-term efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors they should be administered only in women with symptoms refractory to other conventional therapies in a clinical research setting. Promising preliminary data have emerged from multicenter Phase III<PERSON> trials on elagolix, a new oral GnRH<ORGANIZATION> antagonist but non-inferiority RCT<ORGANIZATION> data are required to compare elagolix with first-line therapies for endometriosis.
