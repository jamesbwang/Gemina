 ( R ) -2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyric acid ( R-HPBA ) is a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The asymmetric reduction of 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid ( OPBA<ORGANIZATION> ) by oxidoreductases is an efficient approach for its synthesis. Here, we report a novel biocatalytic approach for asymmetric synthesis of R-HPBA using recombinant Pichia pastoris expressing the Tyr52Leu<ORGANIZATION> variant of D-lactate dehydrogenase ( D-LDH ) from Lactobacillus<GPE> plantarum. The recombinant yeast cells showed impressive catalytic activity at a high concentration of NaOPBA<GPE> ( 380 mM, 76 g/L ) and achieved full conversion starting with 40 g/L NaOPBA<ORGANIZATION> or even at higher concentration. Under optimized reaction conditions ( pH 7.5, 37 Â°C, and 2 % glucose ), a full conversion with > 95 % reaction yield and ~ 100 % product enantiomeric excess ( ee ) was achieved for the preparation of R-HPBA on a 2-g scale. The findings of this study promote both the biotransformation of R-HPBA and an extension of the application of recombinant yeast as biocatalysts.
