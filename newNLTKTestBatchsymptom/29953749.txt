 The pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP<ORGANIZATION> ) has not been fully clarified. Anti-αvβ3 integrin autoantibody is detected in chronic ITP<ORGANIZATION> patients, but its contribution to ITP<ORGANIZATION> is still unclear. To clarify the potential role of anti-αvβ3 integrin autoantibody in chronic ITP<ORGANIZATION> and the related mechanism. Relationship between levels of anti-αvβ3 autoantibody and platelets in chronic ITP<ORGANIZATION> patients was evaluated. Influence of anti-αvβ3 antibody on megakaryocytes ( MKs<ORGANIZATION> ) survival, differentiation, migration and adhesion was assessed, and the associated signal pathways were investigated. Platelet recovery and MKs<ORGANIZATION> distribution were observed in ITP<ORGANIZATION> mouse model pretreated with different antibodies. In this study, we showed that the anti-αvβ3 autoantibody usually coexists with anti-αIIbβ3 autoantibody in chronic ITP<ORGANIZATION> patients, and patients with both autoantibodies have lower platelets. In vitro studies, we showed that the anti-αvβ3 antibody had no significant effect on the survival and proliferation of MKs<ORGANIZATION>, while it decreased formations of proplatelet significantly. Anti-αvβ3 antibody impeded SDF-1 mediated migration and inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT<ORGANIZATION>. Anti-αvβ3 antibody significantly inhibited MKs<ORGANIZATION> adhesion to ECs<ORGANIZATION> and Fg. The phosphorylation of FAK<ORGANIZATION> and SRC<ORGANIZATION> induced by adhesion was inhibited when MKs<ORGANIZATION> were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 antibody. In vivo studies, we showed that injection with anti-α These findings demonstrate that the autoantibody against integrin α
