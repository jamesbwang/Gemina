 The purpose of our analysis was to assess the effects of pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures. Pulmonary hypertension alters physiologic patterns that has the potential to complicate laparoscopic procedures, however, an in-depth analysis evaluating survival outcomes, complications, and associated comorbidities has not been done before. Data from the National Inpatient<ORGANIZATION> Survey were used to identify 179,663 patients without PH<ORGANIZATION> and 1453 patients with PH undergoing laparoscopic procedures from the years 2003-2013. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, the presence of the following comorbidities, congestive heart failure ( OR 3.56 ) diabetes with chronic complications ( OR 3.74 ) fluid and electrolyte disorders ( OR 7.34 ) metastatic cancer ( OR 14.42 ) and peripheral vascular disease ( OR 3.12 ) increased in-patient mortality. In regards to post-operative complications, patients with PH<ORGANIZATION> were more likely to have cardiac complications defined as cardiac arrest, cardiac insufficiency, cardiorespiratory failure, or heart failure ( OR 3.74 ). Patients with PH<ORGANIZATION> were also more likely to develop iatrogenic pneumothorax ( OR 4.13 ) iatrogenic pulmonary embolism ( OR 7.65 ) and post-operative urinary complications ( OR 1.92 ). Overall, the comorbidity with the highest association with in-patient mortality was metastatic cancer and of all complications, patients with PH<ORGANIZATION> were most likely to develop iatrogenic pulmonary embolism. Preparing for these adversities, notably in patients with certain associated conditions has the potential to improve patient outcome.
