 Long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP1<ORGANIZATION> ) receptor ( GLP1R<ORGANIZATION> ) agonists ( GLP1RA<ORGANIZATION> ), like Exendin-4 ( Ex4 ), promote weight loss. Based on a newly-discovered interaction between GLP1<ORGANIZATION> and oleoylethanolamide ( OEA<ORGANIZATION> ), we tested whether OEA<ORGANIZATION> enhances GLP1RA-mediated anorectic signaling and weight loss. We analyzed the effect of GLP1+OEA and Ex4+OEA on canonical GLP1R<ORGANIZATION> signaling and other proteins/pathways that contribute to the hypophagic action of GLP1RA<GPE> ( AMPK<ORGANIZATION>, Akt<PERSON>, mTOR<ORGANIZATION> and glycolysis ). We demonstrate that OEA<ORGANIZATION> enhances canonical GLP1R signaling when combined with GLP1<ORGANIZATION> but not with Ex4<PERSON>. GLP1<ORGANIZATION> and Ex4 promote phosphorylation of mTOR<ORGANIZATION> pathway components, but OEA<ORGANIZATION> does not enhance this effect. OEA synergistically enhanced GLP1- and Ex4-stimulated glycolysis but did not augment the hypophagic action of GLP1<ORGANIZATION> or Ex4 in lean or diet-induced obese ( DIO<ORGANIZATION> ) mice. However, the combination of Ex4+OEA promoted greater weight loss in DIO<ORGANIZATION> mice than Ex4<PERSON> or OEA<ORGANIZATION> alone during a 7-day treatment. This was due in part to transient hypophagia and increased energy expenditure, phenotypes also observed in Ex4-treated DIO<ORGANIZATION> mice. Thus, OEA<ORGANIZATION> augments specific GLP1RA-stimulated signaling but appears to work in parallel with Ex4<PERSON> to promote weight loss in DIO<ORGANIZATION> mice. Elucidating cooperative mechanisms underlying Ex4+OEA-mediated weight loss could, therefore, be leveraged towards more effective obesity therapies.
