 Cystoid<GPE> macular edema ( CME<ORGANIZATION> ) is a rare complication of the paclitaxel. However, the pathophysiology was unknown. A 60-year-old female presented with bilateral blurred vision due to cystoid macular edema after taking 12-course paclitaxel for her breast cancer. Optical coherence tomography ( OCT<ORGANIZATION> ), fluorescein angiography ( FAG<ORGANIZATION> ), indocyanine green angiography ( ICGA<ORGANIZATION> ), electroretinogram ( ERG<ORGANIZATION> ) and electrooculogram ( EOG<ORGANIZATION> ) were performed. Paclitaxel-induced macular edema. Paclitaxel<PERSON> was discontinued and supportive treatment with pentoxifylline was given. The OCT<ORGANIZATION> showed bilateral cystoid macular edema. Impaired filling of choriocapillaries was noted on the ICGA<ORGANIZATION> ; while EOG<ORGANIZATION> revealed decreased Arden<PERSON> ratio. The visual acuity, cystoid macular edema and decreased Arden<PERSON> ratio improved slowly over six months. Paclitaxel<PERSON> rarely causes cystoid macular edema. The damage of choriocapillaries and retinal pigment epithelium might be the underlying cause. Immediate discontinuation of the drug helps visual recovery.
