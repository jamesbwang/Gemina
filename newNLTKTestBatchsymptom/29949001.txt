 We aimed to provide a systematic description of our 2-year experience using a standardized bedside, single burr hole approach to intracranial multimodality monitoring ( MMM<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury ( sTBI<ORGANIZATION> ), focusing on safety and probe reliability. We performed this observational cohort study at a university-affiliated, Level<PERSON> I trauma center with dedicated 20-bed neuroscience intensive care unit. We included 43 consecutive sTBI<ORGANIZATION> patients who required MMM<ORGANIZATION> to guide clinical care based on institutional protocol and had a four-lumen bolt placed to measure intracranial pressure, brain tissue oxygen, regional cerebral blood flow, brain temperature, and intracranial electroencephalography. sTBI<ORGANIZATION> patients were aged 41.6 ± 17.5 years ( mean ± SD ) and 84 % were men. MMM<ORGANIZATION> devices were placed at a median of 12.5 h ( interquartile range [ IQR ] 9.0-21.4 h ) after injury and in non-dominant frontal lobe in 72.1 % of cases. Monitoring was conducted for a median of 97.1 h ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 46.9-124.6 h ) per patient. While minor hemorrhage, pneumocephalus, or small bone chips were common, only one ( 2.4 % ) patient experienced significant hemorrhage related to device placement. Radiographically, device malpositioning was noted in 13.9 % of patients. Inadvertent device discontinuation occurred for at least one device in 58 % of patients and was significantly associated with the frequency of travel for procedures or imaging. Devices<PERSON> remained in place for > 80 % of the total monitoring period and generated usable data > 50 % of that time. A standardized, bedside single burr hole approach to MMM<ORGANIZATION> was safe. Despite some probe-specific recording limitations, MMM<ORGANIZATION> provided real-time measurements of intracranial pressure, oxygenation, regional cerebral blood flow, brain temperature, and function.
