 Survivin<GPE> is a well-established target in experimental cancer therapy. While hardly expressed in normal tissues, it is over-expressed in most human tumors, including colorectal cancer ( CRC<ORGANIZATION> ). Different compartmentalization of Survivin<GPE> enables its multiple functions as a key controller of cell division, apoptosis, stress-induced signaling and also of migration and metastasis. Because of the lack of its enzymatic activity, this oncoprotein is considered to be undruggable. Nevertheless, small-molecule interfacial inhibitors interfering with its dimerization and/or disrupting the Survivin-Ran protein complex were shown to be potent drugs causing Survivin proteasomal degradation and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Based on our results with different CRC<ORGANIZATION> cell lines, we show that the Survivin inhibitor LLP3<ORGANIZATION> might be effective as mono-therapy in the subgroup of p53-proficient and also some p53-mutated tumors, independent of mismatch repair status. When combined with irinotecan, expression of the tumor suppressor X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis factor 1 ( XAF1<ORGANIZATION> ) plays a decisive role for sensitization of CRC<ORGANIZATION> cells to this first-line drug, however, only in the p53-mutated background. The combination treatment with IT should be avoided in p53-proficient tumors independent of XAF1<ORGANIZATION> expression, since no sensitization to or even protection against moderate-toxic concentrations of IT might occur.
