 This study investigates the impact of maxillary advancement ( Le<PERSON> Fort I osteotomy ) on consonant proficiency in patients with cleft lip and palate ( CLP<ORGANIZATION> ) and explores how these patients and lay people perceive their speech 1 year post Le<PERSON> Fort I osteotomy. Retrospective group study before and after treatment. All patients with CLP<ORGANIZATION> who had undergone Le Fort I osteotomy for maxillary retrognathia between 2007 and 2010 at Karolinska University Hospital<ORGANIZATION>, Sweden<GPE> ( n = 21 ). Six patients were excluded due to additional malformations and missing data. Two experienced speech and language pathologists assessed consonant proficiency, and speech accuracy was determined by lay listeners from pre- and postoperative standardized audio recordings. The patients ' satisfaction with speech postoperatively was collected from medical records. Percentage of oral consonants correct and acoustic analysis of /s/, lay listeners ' opinion, and patients ' satisfaction with speech. One year postoperation, 11 of the 15 patients had improved articulation, especially on the /s/-sound, without speech intervention. The mean percentage of oral consonants correct before treatment ( 82 % ) was significantly improved later ( 95 % ; P<PERSON> > .01 ). This assessment was supported by the patients ' satisfaction with speech. However, lay listeners ' opinion on accuracy was inconsistent. Length<PERSON> of maxillary advancement or change in occlusion did not correlate with change in articulation. Maxillary advancement performed to normalize occlusion and facial profile improved consonant proficiency in patients with CLP<ORGANIZATION> 1 year postoperation. Lay listeners ' and patients ' perceptions of speech need further exploration.
