 Growth<GPE> monitoring and promotion ( GMP<ORGANIZATION> ) programmes promote not only child health but serve as a service delivery strategy to enhance coverage for other crucial nutrition-specific interventions. This study compared community-based and facility-based GMP<ORGANIZATION> programme with respect to attendance rates, children 's nutritional status, caregivers ' satisfaction with services received and perceptions of service providers and users on factors influencing utilization. Explanatory sequential mixed methods study conducted in Ga West<GPE> municipality, Ghana<GPE>. It comprised 12-month secondary data analysis using growth monitoring registers of 220 infants aged 0-3 months enrolled in two community-based ( CB<ORGANIZATION> = 104 ) and two facility-based ( FB<ORGANIZATION> = 116 ) child welfare clinics ; cross-sectional survey ( exit interview ) of 232 caregiver-child pairs accessing CB ( Mean<ORGANIZATION> annual attendance to both programmes was similar with an average of six visits per year. Only 13.6 % of caregiver-child pairs attained more than nine visits in the 12-months period. At least 60 % of children in both programs had improved weight-for-age z-scores ( WAZ<ORGANIZATION> ) scores during participation. Predictors for improved WAZ were being underweight at baseline ( AOR:11.1, 95 % CI:4.0-31.0 ), annual attendance of at least six visits ( AOR:2.2, 95 % CI:1.1-4.1 ) and meeting the Ghana Health Service<ORGANIZATION> target of nine visits ( AOR:4.65, 95 % CI:1.4-15.1 ). Compared to 31.5 % CB users, significant proportion of FB<ORGANIZATION> caregivers ( 57.4 % ) were visited at home. Half<PERSON> were dissatisfied with services received ( CB:55.6 % vs. FB:62.0 %, The association of increased attendance with improved growth reaffirms the need to strengthen primary healthcare systems to improve service delivery ; sensitize caregivers on contribution of growth monitoring and promotion to early child development ; and increase contacts through home visits.
