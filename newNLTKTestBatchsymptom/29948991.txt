 There is insufficient data from India<GPE> regarding clinical predictors of dyssynergic defecation. To identify demography, symptom, and colonoscopic parameters that can predict dyssynergic defecation ( DD ) among patients with chronic constipation ( CC ) and to compare the profile among male and female patients with DD<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> collected from three centers during June 2014 to May 2017 included age, gender, symptom duration, form and consistency of stools, digital examination, colonoscopy, and anorectal manometry ( ARM<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients were grouped based on ARM<ORGANIZATION> diagnosis: group I ( normal study ) and group II ( DD ). The two groups were compared for demography, symptom profile, and colonoscopy findings. Gender-wise subset analysis was done for those with the normal and abnormal ARM<ORGANIZATION> using chi-square and unpaired t tests. Of 236 patients with CC<ORGANIZATION> evaluated, 130 ( 55 % ) had normal ARM<ORGANIZATION> and 106 ( 45 % ) had DD. Male<PERSON> sex, straining during defecation, bleeding per rectum, and abnormal colonoscopic diagnosis were significantly more common in group II. While bleeding per rectum and absence of urge to defecate were more common in males ( p < 0.02 ), straining, digital evacuation, and hard stools were commoner in females with DD<ORGANIZATION>. Straining during defecation, bleeding per rectum, and abnormal colonoscopy findings were more common in patients with DD<ORGANIZATION>. Symptoms of bleeding per rectum and absence of urge to defecate in men and straining during defecation in female patients were significantly associated with DD<ORGANIZATION>. Symptoms<PERSON> differ in males and females with DD<ORGANIZATION>.
