 Chronic<GPE> low back pain ( CLBP<ORGANIZATION> ) disability has been particularly frustrating because its treatment has been a great therapeutic challenge. Disability<ORGANIZATION> has been suggested to depend on different factors that should be found and considered in the medical management. The inter-segmental<ORGANIZATION> coordination is often impaired in CLBP<ORGANIZATION> subjects ; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence about the relationship between the existence of coordination problems and disability in CLBP<ORGANIZATION> patients. To evaluate the correlation between sagittal plane trunk-pelvis inter-segmental coordination parameters during walking and disability level in CLBP<ORGANIZATION> patients. Kinematic data were collected from 16 non-specific CLBP<ORGANIZATION> ( 18-40 years ) volunteers during walking. Sagittal<ORGANIZATION> plane time-normalized segmental angles and velocities were used to calculate continuous relative phase for each data point. Coordination parameters, mean absolute relative phase ( MARP<ORGANIZATION> ) and deviation phase ( DP ) were derived to quantify the trunk-pelvis coordination pattern and variability during gait cycles, respectively. The disability level was quantified through Oswestry Disability Index<ORGANIZATION> ( ODI<ORGANIZATION> ) questionnaire. Pearson<PERSON> correlation coefficient was used to find the probable correlation between coordination parameters and disability level. The analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between sagittal plane MARP<ORGANIZATION> or DP<ORGANIZATION> and disability level ( % ODI ) in CLBP<ORGANIZATION> subjects during walking ( r= -0.806 P < 0.001 and r= -0.856, P<PERSON> < 0.001, respectively ). This study demonstrated that the lower the MARP<ORGANIZATION> ( more in-phase pattern ) and DP<ORGANIZATION> ( less variable pattern ) in the CLBP<ORGANIZATION> subjects, the more disability existing in such patients. The results suggest that clinicians should look beyond pain management when prescribing rehabilitation for CLBP<ORGANIZATION> and consider interventions that target segmental coordination improvement to manage CLBP<ORGANIZATION> induced disability.
