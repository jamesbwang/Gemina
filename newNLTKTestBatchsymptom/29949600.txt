 Leptin<GPE> is an adipo-myokine that regulates appetite and energy expenditure by a neuroendocrine feedback loop. Leptin<PERSON> levels are positively correlated with BMI<ORGANIZATION> in the spinal cord injury population and leptin levels are greater in individuals with spinal cord injury compared to uninjured controls. Leptin<PERSON> is produced in multiple tissues, including fat, bone, and skeletal muscle and is a putative biomarker of sedentary behavior in older adults. We assessed body composition leptin, adiponectin, and IL-6 levels in 205 men with chronic spinal cord injury. We found no association between age, injury duration, injury level, injury completeness, or walking status and leptin. There was a significant positive association between lean mass and leptin in men with SCI<ORGANIZATION> that was independent of fat. Adjusting for body composition, leptin levels were positively associated with IL-6 and negatively associated with adiponectin levels. When considering men with SCI<ORGANIZATION> and sarcopenic obesity, only fat mass remained positively associated with leptin. We found no association between IL-6, adiponectin, or lean mass and leptin in the sarcopenic obesity group. Our findings suggest that lean mass is an under recognized, but substantial, source of circulating leptin. Furthermore, SCI-related sarcopenic obesity may result in dysregulated adipo-myokine metabolism with local and systemic physiologic effects.
