 Although high-grade dysplastic nodule ( HGDN<ORGANIZATION> ) is a preneoplastic lesion that precedes hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ), the genomic structures of HGDN<ORGANIZATION> in conjunction with HCC<ORGANIZATION> remain elusive. The objective of this study was to identify genomic alterations of HGDN<ORGANIZATION> and its difference from HCC<ORGANIZATION> that may drive HGDN<ORGANIZATION> progression to HCC<ORGANIZATION>. We analyzed 16 regions of paired HGDN<ORGANIZATION> and HCC<ORGANIZATION> from 6 patients using whole-exome sequencing to find somatic mutation and copy number alteration ( CNA<ORGANIZATION> ) profiles of HGDN<ORGANIZATION> and HCC<ORGANIZATION>. The number of mutations, driver mutations, and CNAs<ORGANIZATION> of HGDNs<ORGANIZATION> were not significantly different from those of HCCs<ORGANIZATION>. We identified that the CNA<ORGANIZATION> gain of 1q25.3-1q42.13 was predominant in the HCCs<ORGANIZATION> compared to that in the HGDNs<ORGANIZATION>. Two cases ( one nodule-in-nodule case and another case with closely attached HCC<ORGANIZATION> and HGDN<ORGANIZATION> ) showed several overlapped driver mutations ( CTNNB1<ORGANIZATION> and CEBPA<ORGANIZATION> ) and CNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( losses of CDKN2A<ORGANIZATION>, RB1<ORGANIZATION> and TP53<ORGANIZATION> ) between HGDNs<ORGANIZATION> and HCCs<ORGANIZATION>, suggesting their roles in the early HCC<ORGANIZATION> development. The other 4 cases with spatially separated HCCs<ORGANIZATION> and HGDNs<ORGANIZATION> showed few overlapped alterations between the paired HCCs<ORGANIZATION> and HGDNs<ORGANIZATION>. Mutations in ERBB2<ORGANIZATION> and CCND1<ORGANIZATION>, and CNAs<ORGANIZATION> ( gains of CTNNB1<ORGANIZATION>, MET<ORGANIZATION> and SMO<ORGANIZATION> and losses of PTEN<ORGANIZATION>, TP53<ORGANIZATION> and SETD2<ORGANIZATION> ) were identified as 'HCC-predominant ', suggesting their roles in the progression of HGDN<ORGANIZATION> to HCC<ORGANIZATION>. Our data show that HCCs<ORGANIZATION> are direct descendants of HGDNs<ORGANIZATION> in some cases, but there is no direct evidence of such relationship in spatially separated cases. Genomic features of HGDN<ORGANIZATION> identified in this study provide a useful resource for dissecting clues for the genetic diagnosis of HGDN<ORGANIZATION> and HCC<ORGANIZATION>.
