 Medium-vessel hemorrhage is a rare occurrence in ANCA-associated vasculitis, and has been previously described in only a few patients with microscopic polyangiitis. We report a case of renal hemorrhage in a patient with microscopic polyangiitis that was successfully managed by transcatheter arterial embolization of the active bleeding sites. The early clinical findings included necrotizing arteritis, as indicated by skin biopsy ; rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis ; mononeuritis multiplex ; positive screening for myeloperoxidase-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Corticosteroid<PERSON> therapy was initiated. The patient 's health deteriorated at 1 week, with rapidly progressing anemia. Computerized tomography identified a large, right-sided, perirenal hematoma, with active bleeding. Bleeding was successfully managed via segmental embolization of the renal artery. The patient was treated with steroid therapy and MZR<ORGANIZATION>, and subsequently underwent maintenance hemodialysis treatment for end-stage renal disease. Spontaneous renal hemorrhage is a rare but fatal clinical condition. A ruptured renal artery should be considered in a patient with microscopic polyangiitis, even in the absence of previous trauma and renal biopsy, when unexplained anemia or signs of shock occur.
