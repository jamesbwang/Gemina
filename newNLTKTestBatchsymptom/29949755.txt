 Micropeptide<GPE> regulator of β-oxidation ( MOXI<ORGANIZATION> ) is a conserved muscle-enriched protein encoded by an RNA<ORGANIZATION> transcript misannotated as non-coding. MOXI<ORGANIZATION> localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane where it associates with the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, an enzyme complex that plays a critical role in fatty acid β-oxidation. Isolated heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria from MOXI<ORGANIZATION> knockout mice exhibit a diminished ability to metabolize fatty acids, while transgenic MOXI<ORGANIZATION> overexpression leads to enhanced β-oxidation. Additionally, hearts from MOXI<ORGANIZATION> knockout mice preferentially oxidize carbohydrates over fatty acids in an isolated perfused heart system compared to wild-type ( WT ) animals. MOXI<ORGANIZATION> knockout mice also exhibit a profound reduction in exercise capacity, highlighting the role of MOXI<ORGANIZATION> in metabolic control. The functional characterization of MOXI<ORGANIZATION> provides insight into the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and energy homeostasis and underscores the regulatory potential of additional micropeptides that have yet to be identified.
