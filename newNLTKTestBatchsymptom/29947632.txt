 Simple<GPE> silyl ethers like O<GPE> ( SiMe3<ORGANIZATION> ) 2 in contrast to normal ethers are inert to metal bonding ; however, a `` naked '', highly Lewis-acidic, cationic Mg species enforces complexation. DFT<ORGANIZATION> calculations indicate that agostic interactions and van der Waals<PERSON> attraction significantly contribute to the stability of this first example of unsupported metal silyl ether coordination.
