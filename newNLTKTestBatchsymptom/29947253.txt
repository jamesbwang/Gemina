 To systematically review the existing literature on the 3D radiological evaluation of secondary alveolar bone grafting ( SABG<ORGANIZATION> ) in cleft lip and palate ( CLP<ORGANIZATION> ) patients, with specific interest in 3D imaging protocols and assessment methods. A comprehensive literature search on PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Embase<PERSON> and the Cochrane<ORGANIZATION> Library was conducted. Included publications concerned 3D imaging for evaluation of SABG<ORGANIZATION> in CLP<ORGANIZATION> patients while articles about primary or tertiary bone grafting or using of 2D images only were excluded. Study<PERSON> quality was evaluated using the Methodological Index<ORGANIZATION> for Non-Randomized Studies ( MINORS<ORGANIZATION> ) or the Cochrane Collaboration<ORGANIZATION> tool for assessing risk of bias. The search yielded 1735 citations, of which 38 met the inclusion criteria. We noticed a large variability in imaging protocols and bone graft evaluation methods between studies. Most articles were observational studies with medium to low methodological quality, except for the one RCT having a low risk of bias. There is a lack of prospective, controlled trials based on a consistent imaging protocol with a sufficiently long follow-up period. A pressing need exists for the development of a consistent optimized imaging protocol for diagnosis and follow-up of SABG<ORGANIZATION> in CLP<ORGANIZATION> patients. Although 3D evaluation methods seem to be more precise than 2D methods, we should be careful when comparing outcomes arising from different 3D measuring techniques.
