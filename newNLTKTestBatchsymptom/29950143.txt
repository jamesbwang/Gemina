 Bone-regulating hormones and nutrients play an important role in influencing metabolic health. The aim of this study was to determine whether bone-regulating hormones and nutrients, such as parathyroid hormone ( PTH<ORGANIZATION> ), 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ), and magnesium ( Mg ) could be used to characterize the metabolically healthy obese ( MHO<ORGANIZATION> ) phenotype. This study included 27 overweight or obese participants ( 14 men/13 women ) classified as MHO<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 14 ) or metabolically unhealthy obese ( MUO<ORGANIZATION> ) ( n = 13 ) based on the presence or absence of metabolic abnormalities, determined by percentage body fat, percentage trunk fat, and waist circumference. Biochemical ( serum concentrations of hormones and cytokines such as PTH<ORGANIZATION>, 25OHD, ionized Mg<GPE> ( iMg<ORGANIZATION> ), cytokines, lipids, glycemic indices ), physiological ( percentage body fat, percentage trunk fat, blood pressure ( BP ) ), and dietary intake ( Mg intake, calcium intake ) measurements were obtained. Serum PTH<PERSON> concentrations were significantly lower ( p = 0.005 ) in the MHO<ORGANIZATION> group ( 39.68 ± 11.06 pg/mL ) compared with the MUO<ORGANIZATION> group ( 63.78 ± 25.82 pg/mL ). Serum<PERSON> iMg concentrations were higher ( p = 0.052 ) in the MHO<ORGANIZATION> group ( 0.565 ± 0.41 mmol/L ) than in the MUO<ORGANIZATION> group ( 0.528 ± 0.050 mmol/L ). Serum concentrations of osteocalcin were also higher ( 10.37 ± 3.70 ng/mL ) in the MHO<ORGANIZATION> compared with the MUO<ORGANIZATION> ( 6.51 ± 4.14 ng/mL ) group ( p = 0.017 ). The MHO<ORGANIZATION> group had significantly lower serum insulin concentrations ( p = 0.006 ) and diastolic BP ( p = 0.035 ). Concentrations of serum 25OHD, total triglycerides, C-reactive protein and systolic BP did not differ between groups. These findings suggest that bone-regulating hormones and nutrients, especially serum PTH<ORGANIZATION>, osteocalcin concentrations, and dietary Mg intakes, can help to characterize the MHO<ORGANIZATION> phenotype.
