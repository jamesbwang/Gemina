 The mechanisms by which varicocele affects fertility remain undetermined. Vitamin A ( all-trans retinoic acid [ ATRA ] ) is required for fertility and normal spermatogenesis ; however, the mechanisms driving its action are not defined yet. Previously, we demonstrated in varicocele sperm a reduced RARÎ±<ORGANIZATION> expression and that ATRA<ORGANIZATION> influence sperm performance. To further define vitamin A significance in male gamete and in the physiopathology of varicocele, we tested for the first time ATRA<ORGANIZATION> action on human sperm metabolism and antioxidant defense systems. Evaluating triglycerides content and lipase activity, in normal sperm ATRA<ORGANIZATION> had a lipid lowering effect, which was not observed in varicocele sperm. The modulation of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, concomitantly with a reduction of the glucose content, highlight an ATRA<ORGANIZATION> role on glucose metabolism. ATRA<ORGANIZATION> induced the superoxide dismutase ( SOD<ORGANIZATION> ) and glutathione transferase activities, while it reduced the malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ) production both in healthy and varicocele sperm. Interestingly, SOD1<ORGANIZATION> and SOD2<ORGANIZATION> have been localized in the acrosome and midpiece, glutathione- S-transferase omega 2 ( GSTO2<ORGANIZATION> ) in the acrosome, equatorial, and subacrosomial regions. SOD1<ORGANIZATION>, SOD2<ORGANIZATION>, and GSTO2<ORGANIZATION> levels were significantly lower in varicocele with respect to healthy sperm. Herein<PERSON>, we discovered that ATRA<ORGANIZATION> treatment was able to reprogram sperm metabolism toward that of the capacitation status. The retinol protected human sperm from ROS<ORGANIZATION> damage enhancing the antioxidant enzymes activity, providing evidence toward the efficacy of vitamin A as therapeutic tool in improving sperm quality. These novel findings further confirm the importance of vitamin A in male fertility adding new insights into the retinoids complex biological framework.
