 Etoposide<GPE> ( VP16<ORGANIZATION> ) is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and has been used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ). Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C ( XPC<ORGANIZATION> ) protein is a DNA<ORGANIZATION> damage recognition factor in nucleotide excision repair and involved in regulating NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> cell proliferation and viability. Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that is responsible for the stabilization and maturation of many oncogenic proteins. In this study, we report whether Hsp90<PERSON> inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) enhanced etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC<GPE> cells through modulating the XPC<ORGANIZATION> expression. We found that etoposide increased XPC<ORGANIZATION> expression in an AKT<ORGANIZATION> activation manner in 2 squamous cell carcinoma H1703<PERSON> and H520<ORGANIZATION> cells. Knockdown of XPC<ORGANIZATION> using siRNA<ORGANIZATION> or inactivation of AKT<ORGANIZATION> by pharmacological inhibitor PI3K<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor ( LY294002<ORGANIZATION> ) enhanced the cytotoxic effects of etoposide. In contrast, enforced expression of XPC<ORGANIZATION> cDNA or AKT-CA ( a constitutively active form of AKT<ORGANIZATION> ) reduced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of etoposide. Hsp90<PERSON> inhibitor 17-AAG enhanced cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of etoposide in NSCLC<GPE> cells, which were associated with the downregulation of XPC<ORGANIZATION> expression and inactivation of AKT<ORGANIZATION>. Our findings suggested that the Hsp90<GPE> inhibition induced XPC<ORGANIZATION> downregulation involved in enhancing the etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in H1703<GPE> and H520<ORGANIZATION> cells.
