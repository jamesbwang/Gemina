 To study the clinical efficacy and safety of dexamethasone of different doses combined with bortezomib and thalidomide for treatment of primary multiple myeloma. Ninety-six patients with multiple myeloma from January 2013 to January 2014 were randomly divided into group A ( high-dose dexamethasone + bortezomib + thalidomide, 32 cases ), group B ( low-dose dexamethasone + bortezomib + thalidomide, 32 cases ) and group C ( placebo + bortezomib + thalidomide, 32 cases ). The clinical efficacy and safety of patients was compared among 3 groups. The overall remission rate ( ORR<ORGANIZATION> ) in group A and B<PERSON> was significantly higher than that in group C ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), but the ORR<ORGANIZATION> was not significant difference between group A and group B ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). After treatment, the KPS<ORGANIZATION> and RNS<ORGANIZATION> score in 3 groups were significantly higher and lower than those before treatment, respectively ; the KPS<ORGANIZATION> score in group A and B<PERSON> was significantly higher than that in group C ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), the RNS<ORGANIZATION> score in group A and B<PERSON> was significantly lower C ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). After treatment, the positive expression rates of CD38<ORGANIZATION>, CD56<ORGANIZATION> and CD138<ORGANIZATION> as well as small residual lesion ( SRL<ORGANIZATION> ) positive rate in 3 grops were significantly lower than those before treatment, but the positive expression rate of CD19<ORGANIZATION> was significantly higher that before treatment ; the positive expression rates of CD38<ORGANIZATION>, CD56<ORGANIZATION> and CD138<ORGANIZATION> as well as SRL<ORGANIZATION> positive rate in group A and B were significantly lower thant those in group C, while the positive expression rate of CD19<ORGANIZATION> was significantly higher that in group C ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), but the positive expression rates of CD19<ORGANIZATION>, CD38<ORGANIZATION>, CD56<ORGANIZATION> and CD138<ORGANIZATION> as well as SRL<ORGANIZATION> positive rate were not significantly different between group A and B ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). The incidence of fatigue, rash, peripheral neuropathy, anlmia, granulocyte deficiance and so on in group B and C<PERSON> was significantly lower than that in group A ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), but the difference in group B and C<PERSON> was not significant ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). The therapeutic efficacy of different doses of dexamethasone combined with bortezomib and thalidomide for patients with multiple myeloma is similar, can obviously enhance remission rate, prolong the survival time, promote life quality, but the incidence of adverse reactions in low dose dexamethason rigemen is significantly reduced, and the safety is better.
