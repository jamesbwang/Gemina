 Venous<GPE> thromboembolism ( VTE<ORGANIZATION> ) is a major public health issue ; deep vein thrombosis ( DVT<ORGANIZATION> ) affects about 1/1000 patients. Each year, VTE<ORGANIZATION> kills more patients in Western Europe<LOCATION> than breast cancer, prostate cancer, acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS<ORGANIZATION> ) and road traffic accidents combined and is responsible for the deaths of approximately 370,000 European<GPE> citizens ( Cohen<PERSON> et al. in Thromb<GPE> Haemost 98:756-764, 2007 ; Bĕlohlávek et al. in Exp<GPE> Clin Cardiol<PERSON> 18 ( 2 ) :129-138, 2013 ). The recently published ATTRACT<ORGANIZATION> trial ( Acute Venous Thrombosis Thrombus Removal<PERSON> with Adjunctive<PERSON> Catheter-directed Thrombolysis ) ( Vedantham<ORGANIZATION> et al. in N Engl J Med 377:2240-2252, 2017 ) concluded that the addition of catheter-directed thrombolysis to standard therapy with anticoagulation and compression stockings offers no significant clinical benefit over standard therapy in terms of reduction in the rate of post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS<ORGANIZATION> ) at 2 years. It is the largest, prospective, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial ( RCT<ORGANIZATION> ) and represents the culmination over a decade of planning, execution and analysis. In this opinion article, we analyse why it was needed, what it demonstrated, some limitations, and the directions in which this important publication will take us.
