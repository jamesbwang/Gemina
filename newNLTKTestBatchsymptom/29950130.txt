 Previous studies indicated that gestational weight gain-related disorders share many similarities with feeding and eating disorders. To examine the association of prepregnancy Body Mass Index<PERSON> ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ), defined according to 2009 Institute of Medicine<GPE> ( IOM<ORGANIZATION> ), and its shift across gestation with symptoms of feeding and eating disorders, defined by EDE-Q ( Fairburn<ORGANIZATION> & Beglin<PERSON>, 2008 ). This prospective cohort study took place at the Division<ORGANIZATION> of Perinatal Medicine<ORGANIZATION> of Policlinico<GPE> Abano Terme, Italy<GPE>, from Jannuary 2015 to October 2015. the sample included 655 healthy at term puerperae. We correlated gestational BMI in different women categories to EDE-Q Global score and Restrain<GPE>, Eating<GPE> concern, Shape<PERSON> concern, and Weight<GPE> concern subscales, by Spearman<PERSON> 's correlation test. Among 655 women, 59 ( 9.0 % ) were categorized as underweight, 463 ( 70.7 % ) normal weight, 98 ( 15.0 % ) overweight, and 35 ( 5.3 % ) as obese in prepregnancy period. At the end of gestation, underweight women category disappeared, normal weight women lightened to one third, overweight women tripled, and obese women doubled. At the same time, EDE-Q global scores increased from normal weight ( 0.25 ± 0.41 ), to overweigh ( 0.47 ± 0.58 ), and to obese ( 0.72 ± 0.70 ) puerperae. In addition, EDE-Q global scores were significantly correlated with gestational BMI<ORGANIZATION> increase in Global<GPE> score ( rho = 0.326 ; p < 0.001 ) and in the four subscales: restrain ( rho = 0.161 ; p < 0.001 ), Eating concern ( rho = 0.193 ; p < 0.001 ), Shape<PERSON> concern ( rho = 0.335 ; p < 0.001 ), and Weight<GPE> concern ( rho = 0.365 ; p < 0.001 ), respectively. It was found that the shift of woman BMI<ORGANIZATION> across an uncomplicated pregnancy is a warning indicator of unhealthy eating and feeding symptoms.
