 Facial<GPE> photoaging has become a major cosmetic concern, and the microneedle fractional radiofrequency system ( MFRS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a novel method for rejuvenation that combines radiofrequency and microneedles. This study prospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of an MFRS in the treatment of facial photoaged skin in Chinese<GPE> patients. Twenty-seven patients with moderate facial photoaging were recruited and received 3 treatments at 4-week intervals. Blinded<PERSON> clinical assessment was performed by 2 independent dermatologists on a 5-point global photoaging scale ( GPS<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients were also questioned on the extent of improvement of rhytides, skin tightening, and complexion with a 4-point global aesthetic improvement scale ( GAIS<ORGANIZATION> ) and satisfaction based on a 5-point scale. Adverse events and pain scores were also evaluated. Compared with the baseline, there was a significant improvement in facial photoaged skin after 3 treatments, and these positive outcomes were maintained up to the 6-month follow-up, according to the GPS<ORGANIZATION> and GAIS<ORGANIZATION> scores. Most patients were satisfied with the treatment and reported mild to moderate pain and adverse effects. This MFRS<ORGANIZATION> is effective for facial skin rejuvenation in Chinese<GPE> patients. The therapy also seems safe and well tolerated.
