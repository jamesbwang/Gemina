 Flammulina<GPE> velutipes is one of the mushrooms produced most widely in East Asia<GPE>. In this study we investigated phenotypic variations of 7 agronomic traits in 37 F. velutipes strains from China<GPE>, and we analyzed their genetic diversity with 70 simple sequence repeat markers. The Shannon<GPE> information index and gene diversity were 0.894 and 0.478, respectively, demonstrating high genetic variation among the tested strains. Poor<PERSON> genetic variation was found among white strains, in contrast to yellow ones. Analysis of population structure resolved 2 unambiguous genetic groups in the tested F. velutipes strains, with little differentiation between them ( FST<ORGANIZATION> = 0.016 ). Yellow<PERSON> cultivars possibly originated from indigenous wild strains in southwest China<GPE>. Phenotypic correlations were identified among the 7 traits. In particular, stipe length ( SL ) was significantly positively correlated with yield, indicating that SL<ORGANIZATION> could be used as an index for breeding high-yield strains. The 2 genetic groups, and white strains and yellow ones, showed significant differences between SL<ORGANIZATION>, yield, and the time interval ( days ) from mycelial scratch to formation of the first fruiting body. These results indicate that these 3 traits were stratified by population structure. Detection of genetic and phenotypic variations would lay the groundwork for further breeding of elite F. velutipes strains.
