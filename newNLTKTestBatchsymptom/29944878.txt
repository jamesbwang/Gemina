 A 26-year-old woman diagnosed with congenital heart disease was admitted to our hospital with exertional dyspnea, cyanotic complexion, and bilateral lower limb edema. All tests revealed isolated severe right ventricular ( RV ) hypertrophy. She was in poor condition, with a diminishing chance for routine surgery, so she was scheduled for orthotopic homologous heart transplantation. After the surgery, isolated severe RV hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( RV<ORGANIZATION> HCM ) was confirmed histologically and pathologically. After the surgery, the patient 's cardiac function was normal. Exertional dyspnea, cyanotic complexion and bilateral lower limb edema all improved postoperatively.
