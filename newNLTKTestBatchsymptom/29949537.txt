 To analyze an expression pattern of the steroid and peptide hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes and EMT-related genes in prostate tumors in relation to the presence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion ; and to examine a putative correlation between gene expression and clinical characteristics, to define the molecular subtypes of prostate cancer. The relative gene expression ( RE ) of 33 transcripts ( 27 genes ) and the presence/absence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion were analyzed by a quantitative PCR<ORGANIZATION>. 37 prostate cancer tissues ( T ) paired with conventionally normal prostate tissue ( CNT<ORGANIZATION> ) and 21 samples of prostate adenomas were investigated. RE changes were calculated, using different protocols of statistics. We demonstrated differences in RE of seven genes between tumors and CNT<ORGANIZATION>, as was calculated, using the 2-Î”CT model and the Wilcoxon<ORGANIZATION> matched paired test. Five genes ( ESR1<ORGANIZATION>, KRT18<ORGANIZATION>, MKI67<ORGANIZATION>, MMP9<ORGANIZATION>, PCA3<ORGANIZATION> ) showed altered expression in adenocarcinomas, in which the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion was detected. Two genes ( INSR<ORGANIZATION>, isoform B and HOTAIR<ORGANIZATION> ) expressed differently in tumors without fusion. Comparison<ORGANIZATION> of the gene expression pattern in adenomas, CNT<ORGANIZATION> and adenocarcinomas demonstrated that in adenocarcinomas, bearing the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion, genes KRT18<ORGANIZATION>, PCA3<ORGANIZATION>, and SCHLAP1<ORGANIZATION> expressed differently. At the same time, we detected differences in RE of AR<GPE> ( isoform 2 ), MMP9<ORGANIZATION>, PRLR<ORGANIZATION> and HOTAIR<ORGANIZATION> in adenocarcinomas without the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion. Two genes ( ESR1<ORGANIZATION> and SRD5A2<ORGANIZATION> ) showed differences in RE in both adenocarcinoma groups. Fourteen genes, namely AR ( isoforms 1 and 2 ), CDH1<ORGANIZATION>, OCLN<ORGANIZATION>, NKX3-1, XIAP<ORGANIZATION>, GCR<ORGANIZATION> ( ins AG ), INSR<ORGANIZATION> ( isoform A ), IGF1R<ORGANIZATION>, IGF1R<ORGANIZATION> tr, PRLR<ORGANIZATION>, PRL<ORGANIZATION>, VDR<ORGANIZATION> and SRD5A2<ORGANIZATION> showed correlation between RE<ORGANIZATION> and tumor stage. RE of four genes ( CDH2<ORGANIZATION>, ESR2<ORGANIZATION>, VDR<ORGANIZATION> and SRD5A2<ORGANIZATION> ) correlated with differentiation status of tumors ( Gleason<PERSON> score ). Using the K-means clustering, we could cluster adenocarcinomas in three groups, according to gene expression profiles. A specific subtype of prostate tumors is characterized by the activated ERG<ORGANIZATION> signaling, due to the presence of TMPRSS2/ERG fusion, and also by high levels of the androgen receptor, prolactin, IGF<ORGANIZATION>, INSR<ORGANIZATION> and PCA3<ORGANIZATION>. We have found the specific differences in expression of the steroid and peptide hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes and EMT-related genes, depending on the pre-sence/absence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion in prostate adenocarcinomas, CNT<ORGANIZATION> and adenomas. We showed three different gene expression profiles of prostate adenocarcinomas. One of them is characteristic for adenocarcinomas with the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion. Further experiments are needed to confirm these data in a larger cohort of patients.
