 Service<GPE> recommendation has become an effective way to quickly extract insightful information from massive data. However, in the cloud environment, the quality of service ( QoS<ORGANIZATION> ) data used to make recommendation decisions are often monitored by distributed sensors and stored in different cloud platforms. In this situation, integrating these distributed data ( monitored by remote sensors ) across different platforms while guaranteeing user privacy is an important but challenging task, for the successful service recommendation in the cloud environment. Locality-Sensitive Hashing ( LSH<ORGANIZATION> ) is a promising way to achieve the abovementioned data integration and privacy-preservation goals, while current LSH-based recommendation studies seldom consider the possible recommendation failures and hence reduce the robustness of recommender systems significantly. In view of this challenge, we develop a new LSH<ORGANIZATION> variant, named converse LSH<ORGANIZATION>, and then suggest an exception handling approach for recommendation failures based on the converse LSH<ORGANIZATION> technique. Finally, we conduct several simulated experiments based on the well-known dataset, i.e., Movielens<GPE> to prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
