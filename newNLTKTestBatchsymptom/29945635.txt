 The aim was to determine the prognostic value of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with completely resected stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ). The study enrolled 382 NSCLC patients, and an optimal NLR<ORGANIZATION> cutoff value was determined by ROC<ORGANIZATION> analysis. Patients were divided by preoperative NLR<ORGANIZATION> into low ( < 1.5, n = 99 ), intermediate ( 1.5 ≤ NLR < 3.5, n = 245 ), and high ( NLR<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 3.5, n = 38 ) value groups. Serum<PERSON> diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites ( d-ROMs ) were assayed in 33 consecutive patients and used as an indicator of oxidative stress. The mean NLR in patients with high d-ROMs ( > 300 U.CARR, n = 16 ) was 1.72 ± 0.67, which was significantly higher than that in patients with low d-ROMs ( 1.41 ± 0.39, n = 17 ; P<PERSON> = 0.018 ). The 3-, 5- and 10-year survival rates in the three NLR<ORGANIZATION> groups were 92, 77, and 59 % ( low ) ; 82, 70, and 50 % ( intermediate ) ; and 76, 58, and 32 % ( high ) ( P<PERSON> = 0.034 ). The 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates in the three groups were 98, 90, and 86 % ( low ), 91, 77, and 74 % ( intermediate ) ; and 92, 77, and 68 % ( high ) ( P<PERSON> = 0.033 ). Multivariate analysis found that although NLR<ORGANIZATION> was not predictive of overall survival, high NLR<ORGANIZATION> was an independent risk factor of recurrence ( hazard ratio: 2.03, 95 % confidence interval: 1.17-3.79, P<PERSON> = 0.011 ) as were as age, pathological stage, tumor differentiation, and lymph-vascular invasion. A low preoperative NLR<ORGANIZATION> predicted good prognosis, and was associated with low systemic inflammation status in patients with stage 1 NSCLC. It may be helpful when considering intervals of routine follow-up or choice of adjuvant therapy.
