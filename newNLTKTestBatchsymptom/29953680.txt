 Hypoxia-inducible factors ( HIF<ORGANIZATION> ) play a critical role in inflammatory properties of myeloid-derived cells. The effect of HIFs<ORGANIZATION> on myeloid-derived cell functions in organ transplantation remains unknown, however. We transplanted hearts into transgenic mice with myeloid cell-targeted deletions of HIF-1α or its negative regulator von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL<ORGANIZATION> ) to investigate the effects of HIF-1α inactivation or HIF-pathway activation, respectively, on ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI<ORGANIZATION> ) and acute rejection. Deletion of VHL<ORGANIZATION> in myeloid cells enhanced mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression of anti-inflammatory genes IDO<ORGANIZATION>, Arg-1, and HO-1 in vitro. In vivo, VHL-/- myeloid-derived cells of allograft recipients alleviated IRI<ORGANIZATION> and acute rejection, evidenced by reduced cardiomyocyte damage, decreased proinflammatory cytokine mRNA<ORGANIZATION> levels, and absence of inflammatory infiltrate at 5 days after transplantation. Ultimately, allograft survival was significantly prolonged. In vitro, VHL-/- myeloid-derived cells dose-dependently inhibited T cell proliferation. Myeloid cells with HIF-1α-deletion retained proinflammatory qualities in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of VHL<ORGANIZATION> in myeloid cells of non-immunosuppressed cardiac allograft recipients reduces myocardial injury and acute rejection. We suggest that HIF<ORGANIZATION> transcription factors induce a regulatory phenotype in myeloid-derived cells, which may be harnessed as a novel therapeutic strategy to regulate immune responses after heart transplantation.
