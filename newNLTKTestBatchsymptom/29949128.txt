 To identify the effect of duration of weight-bearing exercise and team sports participation on bone mineral density ( BMD<ORGANIZATION> ) and body composition among adolescents with anorexia nervosa ( AN ). We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records of all patients 9-20 years old with a DSM-5 diagnosis of AN evaluated by the Stanford<ORGANIZATION> Eating Disorders Program ( 1997-2011 ) who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A total of 188 adolescents with AN were included ( 178 females and 10 males ). Using multivariate linear regression, duration of weight-bearing exercise ( B = 0.15, p = 0.005 ) and participation in team sports ( B = 0.53, p = 0.001 ) were associated with higher BMD at the hip and team sports ( B = 0.39, p = 0.006 ) were associated with higher whole body BMC<ORGANIZATION>, controlling for covariates. Participation in team sports ( B = - 1.06, p = 0.007 ) was associated with greater deficits in FMI<ORGANIZATION> Z-score. LBMI<ORGANIZATION> Z-score was positively associated with duration of weight-bearing exercise ( B = 0.10, p = 0.018 ) and may explain the relationship between exercise and bone outcomes. Duration of weight-bearing exercise and team sports participation may be protective of BMD<ORGANIZATION> at the hip and whole body BMC<ORGANIZATION>, while participation in team sports was associated with greater FMI<ORGANIZATION> deficits among adolescents with AN<ORGANIZATION>. Level V<PERSON>, descriptive retrospective study.
