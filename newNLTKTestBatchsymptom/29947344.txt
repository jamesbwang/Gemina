 Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) functions as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and an anti-inflammatory cytokine. To evaluate the levels of IL-6 in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS<ORGANIZATION> ). Level<PERSON> of IL-6 was assessed and recorded for 14 days subsequent to the injury in 161 multiple trauma patients. MODS were diagnosed using Marshal Score<PERSON>. Injury Severity Scoring<PERSON> ( ISS<ORGANIZATION> ) was measured for all patients. The results of this study indicated that there was a significant relationship between the level of IL-6 and ISS<ORGANIZATION> on the first and second days post trauma ( P=0.0001 ). The high level of IL-6 on the second day post trauma was associated with high mortality rate. Our study suggests the second day as the golden time for measuring the serum levels of IL-6. These findings warn us to take more health care actions in patients with higher serum levels of IL-6 on the second day.
