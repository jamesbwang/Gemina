 Unrepaired DNA<ORGANIZATION> damage hinders the maintenance of genome integrity because it blocks the catalytic activity of replicase. The stalled replication fork can be processed through either translesion synthesis ( TLS<ORGANIZATION> ) with specific polymerases, or replication using the undamaged template. To investigate how TLS<ORGANIZATION> activities are regulated and how the stalled replication fork is processed in plants, reversion frequencies and homologous recombination ( HR ) frequencies were analyzed using GUS-based substrates. The HR<ORGANIZATION> frequencies in plants deficient in DNA<ORGANIZATION> polymerase ζ ( Pol<PERSON> ζ ) or Rev1 were higher than that in wildtype plants under normal conditions, and were significantly increased by ultraviolet light irradiation. Heat shock protein ( HSP<ORGANIZATION> ) 90 is known to be involved in various stress responses. To examine the role of HSP90<ORGANIZATION> in the regulation of damage tolerance, we analyzed reversion frequencies and HR<ORGANIZATION> frequencies in plants grown in the presence of a HSP<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor, geldanamycin ( GDA<ORGANIZATION> ). Reversion frequency was lower in GDA-treated plants than in mock-treated plants. Though the HR<ORGANIZATION> frequency was higher in GDA-treated wildtype plants than in mock-treated plants, no significant difference was detected in Rev1-deficient plants. In yeast, TLS<ORGANIZATION> polymerases interacted with each other or with a replication clump component, proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA<ORGANIZATION> ). HSP90<ORGANIZATION> interacted with REV1<ORGANIZATION> or REV7<ORGANIZATION> in Nicotiana<GPE> benthamiana cells. These results suggest that HSP90<ORGANIZATION> interacts with TLS<ORGANIZATION> polymerase ( s ), which promotes error-prone TLS in plants.
