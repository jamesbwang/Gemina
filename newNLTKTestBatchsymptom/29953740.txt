 Although commonly associated with obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ) is also present in the lean population representing a unique disease phenotype. Affecting 25 % of the world 's population, NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> is associated with increased mortality especially when progressed to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH<ORGANIZATION> ). However, no approved pharmacological treatments exist. Current research focuses mainly on NASH<ORGANIZATION> associated with obesity, leaving the effectiveness of promising treatments in lean NASH<ORGANIZATION> virtually unknown. This study therefore aims to evaluate the effect of liraglutide ( glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue ) and dietary intervention, alone and in combination, in guinea pigs with non-obese NASH<ORGANIZATION>. Following 20 weeks of high-fat feeding ( 20 % fat, 15 % sucrose, 0.35 % cholesterol ), 40 female guinea pigs were block-randomized based on weight into four groups receiving one of four treatments for four weeks: continued high-fat diet ( HF<ORGANIZATION>, control ), high-fat diet and liraglutide treatment ( HFL<ORGANIZATION> ), chow diet ( 4 % fat, 0 % sucrose, 0 % cholesterol ; HFC<ORGANIZATION> ) or chow diet and liraglutide treatment ( HFCL<ORGANIZATION> ). High-fat feeding induced NASH<ORGANIZATION> with severe fibrosis. Liraglutide<PERSON> decreased inflammation ( p < 0.05 ) and hepatocyte ballooning ( p < 0.05 ), while increasing hepatic Î±-tocopherol ( p=0.0154 ). Dietary intervention did not improve liver histopathology significantly, but decreased liver weight ( p=0.004 ), plasma total cholesterol ( p=0.0175 ), LDL-cholesterol ( p=0.0063 ), VLDL-cholesterol ( p=0.0034 ), hepatic cholesterol ( p < 0.0001 ) and increased hepatic vitamin C ( p=0.0099 ). Combined liraglutide and dietary intervention, induced a rapid weight loss, necessitating periodical liraglutide dose adjustment/discontinuation, limiting the strength of the findings from this group. Collectively, this pre-clinical study supports the beneficial effect of liraglutide on NASH<ORGANIZATION> and extend this notion to lean NASH<ORGANIZATION>. This article is protected by copyright.
