 This report describes the case of a 58-year-old man with moderate traumatic brain injury ( TBI<ORGANIZATION> ) and pre-accident brain disorders who had multiple persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms. NeuroQuant® 2.0 and NeuroGage® 2.0 MRI brain volume analyses were used during the chronic stage of injury ( > 1 year after injury ) to help understand the effects of the TBI<ORGANIZATION> on his brain volume. NeuroQuant® showed widespread cross-sectional atrophy, especially in the frontal and temporal lobes, consistent with encephalomalacia seen on the MRIs<ORGANIZATION>. Several of his clinical symptoms were consistent with the volume abnormalities. NeuroGage® longitudinal analyses of volume change from the time 1 to time 2 magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormally rapid atrophy and ventricular enlargement. The high rates of volume change were much more consistent with the relatively recent effects of TBI<ORGANIZATION> than with effects of the much more chronic pre-accident brain disorders.
