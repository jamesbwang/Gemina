 Tissue<GPE> diagnosis is required for gastric subepithelial lesions for differential diagnosis of GISTs<ORGANIZATION>. However, there has not been consensus about the best needle for EUS-guided sampling of these lesions. To evaluate the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA for gastric subepithelial lesions of the proper muscle layer with large-bore 19 gauge needles. A prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify consecutive patients who underwent EUS-FNA with 19 and 22 gauge needles for gastric subepithelial lesions of the fourth endosonographic layer in a tertiary care referral center. EUS-FNA was performed by the same endosonographer, using the fanning technique, without on-site cytopathologist. Specimens were analysed through cell blocks by the same pathologist. Procedure results were categorized into diagnostic, defined as enough material for histopathology and immunohistochemistry, or nondiagnostic. Eighty-nine patients ( mean age: 59 years, 77 % women ) underwent 92 EUS-FNA with 19 ( 75 ) or 22 ( 17 ) gauge needles. Mean<PERSON> lesion size was 22.6 mm. Overall diagnostic yield was 88 %. The diagnostic yield of 19 gauge was higher than that of 22 gauge needle ( 92 % x70.6 % ; p=0.0410 ), and similar for lesions > 2 cm and < 2 cm ( 93.7 % x90.7 % ; p=0.9563 ). The best performance for 19 gauge needles was obtained performing < 3 needle passes. Complication rate was 2.8 %. Diagnostic<PERSON> yield of EUS-FNA with 19 gauge needles is 92 % for gastric subepithelial lesions of the proper muscle layer. It is safe and highly valuable for differentiation between GIST<ORGANIZATION> and leiomyoma, no matter the size of the lesion.
