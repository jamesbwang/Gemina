 In congestive heart failure ( CHF<ORGANIZATION> ), sympathetic nervous system is hyperactive. This article reviews current understandings about central and peripheral neural mechanisms underlying sympathetic hyperactivation in this pathological condition. During the development of CHF<ORGANIZATION>, renin-angiotensin system ( RAS<ORGANIZATION> ) activities and angiotensin II-mediated oxidative stress become enhanced. Here, on the basis of findings obtained from animal studies, it is examined how RAS<ORGANIZATION> overactivation and oxidative stress in central and peripheral nervous systems of CHF<ORGANIZATION> mediate sympathetic hyperactivation. Mechanisms by which exercise training in CHF<ORGANIZATION> ameliorates RAS<ORGANIZATION> overactivation, oxidative stress and sympathetic hyperactivation are also investigated.
