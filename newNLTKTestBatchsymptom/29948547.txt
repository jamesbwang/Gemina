 To assess the usefulness of simple axial bi-dimensional diameters of pericardial fat tissues at low-dose chest CT, in correlation with metabolic parameters in predicting metabolic syndrome. Subjects were 373 asymptomatic individuals who performed both low-dose chest CT and abdominal fat CT for medical check-up. Maximum<PERSON> bi-dimensional axial diameters of paracardial fats at right ( RPF<ORGANIZATION> ) and left ( LPF<ORGANIZATION> ) cardiophrenic angle portions, and epicardial fats around right ( REF<ORGANIZATION> ) and left ( LEF<ORGANIZATION> ) coronary arteries, and coronary sinus ( SEF<ORGANIZATION> ) were measured. Correlation between pericardial fat diameters and metabolic parameters were statistically analyzed. RPF<ORGANIZATION>, LPF<ORGANIZATION>, REF<ORGANIZATION>, LEF<ORGANIZATION>, and SEF<ORGANIZATION> diameters were moderately correlated with abdominal visceral fat ( AVF<ORGANIZATION> ) area ( R<ORGANIZATION> = 0.74, 0.70, 0.48, 0.41, and 0.53, respectively, p < 0.01 ) in Pearson<GPE> 's correlation analysis. In multiple linear regression analysis, coefficient of RPF<ORGANIZATION> for AVF<ORGANIZATION> showed highest value. Means of each PF and EF<ORGANIZATION> diameters in subjects with metabolic syndrome were significantly larger than those without metabolic syndrome ( p < 0.001 ). All PF and EF<ORGANIZATION> diameters were well-discriminated for prediction of metabolic syndrome in ROC<ORGANIZATION> analysis ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> values, from 0.696 to 0.795 ). RPF diameter at low-dose chest CT would be a simple method for prediction of metabolic syndrome.
