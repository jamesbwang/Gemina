 This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary phytoncides extracted from discarded Korean<GPE> pine cones ( Pinus<PERSON> koraiensis ) on the performance, egg quality, immune response and gut microflora in laying hens. A total of 400 Hy-Line brown laying hens ( 50-week old ) were allotted into four dietary treatments including a control diet or a diet supplemented with phytoncides at 0.002 %, 0.004 % and 0.008 %. During the 6 weeks of experimental feeding, 0.008 % of dietary phytoncides improved egg production, feed conversion ratio ( p < 0.05 ), but not feed intake, egg weight or feed efficiency. Although dietary phytoncides had no effect on egg quality, decreases in Haugh<GPE> units depending on storage periods were improved by 0.008 % of dietary phytoncides ( p < 0.05 ). To investigate the roles of dietary phytoncides on the alteration of the immune response during inflammation, lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION> ) or saline was intraperitoneally injected into 10 hens per diet group on the end date of the experimental feeding period. Serum immunoglobulins and splenic cytokine expression at mRNA<ORGANIZATION> levels were then measured at 4 hr postinjection. Although the levels of IgA<ORGANIZATION> were decreased by LPS<ORGANIZATION> injection in all dietary groups, dietary phytoncides at 0.008 % showed a higher level of IgA<ORGANIZATION> by LPS<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.05 ). Interestingly, although LPS<ORGANIZATION> injection resulted in an enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î² and IL-6, dietary phytoncides at 0.008 % showed less increased levels of them ( p < 0.05 ). Gut microflora was examined from 10 hens per diet group at the end of the experimental period. While the number of Lactobacillus<GPE> spp. was increased ( p < 0.05 ), Escherichia<GSP> coli counts in the cecal contents were decreased by 0.008 % of dietary phytoncides. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dietary supplementation of 0.008 % phytoncides improved the egg production, immune responses during inflammation and gut microflora in laying hens.
