 Case<GPE> series summary While descriptions of cats with recurrent episodes of feline idiopathic cystitis ( FIC<ORGANIZATION> ) exist, little is published on cats with recurrent episodes of feline lower urinary tract disease ( FLUTD<ORGANIZATION> ) where the cat is diagnosed with different causes of FLUTD<ORGANIZATION> at separate episodes. In the present paper, six cats, originally part of larger studies of FLUTD<ORGANIZATION> among Norwegian<GPE> cats, are described. In the project period ( 2003-2009 ), these cats had several episodes of FLUTD<ORGANIZATION>. At each episode, the cats had a complete physical examination, abdominal imaging, blood work, urinalysis and urine culture performed. Two of the cats initially presented with urolithiasis and subsequently with episodes of non-obstructed FIC<ORGANIZATION>. Four of the cats presented with non-obstructed FIC at one or more episodes, but were later diagnosed with urolithiasis or bacterial cystitis without prior catheterisation or other known predisposing factors. Relevance and novel information Cats with recurrent episodes of FLUTD<ORGANIZATION> may present with different causes at different times. The need to thoroughly work-up cats with recurrent episodes of FLUTD<ORGANIZATION> at each presentation is emphasised. FIC may be considered as a predisposing factor in cats developing urolithiasis or bacterial cystitis ; alternatively, interrelated FLUTD<ORGANIZATION> disease mechanisms exists. Thus, applying multimodal environmental enrichment and modification ( MEMO<ORGANIZATION> ) to cats with signs of FLUTD<ORGANIZATION> independent of diagnosis should be considered.
