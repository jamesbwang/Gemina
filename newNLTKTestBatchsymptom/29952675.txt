 While the acute effects of cold water immersion ( CWI<ORGANIZATION> ) have been widely investigated, research analysing the effects of CWI<ORGANIZATION> over a chronic period in highly-trained athletes is scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CWI<ORGANIZATION> during an intense three week pre-season phase in elite rugby athletes. Twenty-three elite male rugby union athletes were randomized to either CWI ( 10 min at 10 ÂºC, n = 10 ) or a passive recovery control ( CON<ORGANIZATION>, n = 12 ) during three-weeks of high volume training. Athletes were exposed to either CWI or CON<ORGANIZATION>, after each training day ( 12 days in total ). Running loads, conditioning and gym sessions were kept the same between groups. Measures of countermovement jump ( CMJ<ORGANIZATION> ), perceived muscle soreness and wellness were obtained twice a week, and saliva samples for determining cortisol and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) were collected once per week. Although no significant differences were observed between CWI<ORGANIZATION> and CON<ORGANIZATION> for any measure, CWI<ORGANIZATION> resulted in lower fatigue markers throughout the study, as demonstrated by the moderate effects on muscle soreness ( d = 0.58 to 0.91 ) and IL-6 ( d = -0.83 ), and the small effects ( d = 0.23 to 0.38 ) on CMJ<ORGANIZATION> in comparison to CON<ORGANIZATION>. The results from this study demonstrate that CWI<ORGANIZATION> may provide some beneficial effect by reducing fatigue and soreness during an intense three week training phase in elite rugby athletes.
