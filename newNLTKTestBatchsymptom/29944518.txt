 Perioperative anemia is challenging during hospital stay because anemia and red blood cell ( RBC<ORGANIZATION> ) transfusions are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. With the implementation of patient blood management ( PBM<ORGANIZATION> ), a preanesthesia assessment clinic to screen and treat anemia before elective surgery was institutionalized at Muenster University Hospital<ORGANIZATION>, Germany<GPE>. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the association between treating preoperative anemic patients with intravenous iron ( IVI<ORGANIZATION> ) and ( primarily ) presurgical hemoglobin levels and ( secondarily ) use of RBCs<ORGANIZATION> and mortality. Between<PERSON> April 1, 2014, and July 4, 2016, patients scheduled for elective surgery with a risk for RBC<ORGANIZATION> transfusions > 10 % in 2013 were screened for preoperative anemia and, if indicated, treated with IVI<ORGANIZATION>. Patients<PERSON> ' data, time span between visit in the anesthesia/PBM clinic and surgery, demographic data, type of surgery, the difference of hemoglobin levels between visit and surgery, RBC<ORGANIZATION> transfusion, infectious-related International Classification<ORGANIZATION> of Disease<GPE> codes during hospital stay, and 1-year survival were determined retrospectively by screening electronic data files. In addition, patients were interviewed about adverse events, health-related events, and infections via telephone 30, 90, and 365 days after visiting the anesthesia/PBM clinic. A total of 1101 patients were seen in the anesthesia/PBM clinic between days -28 and -1 ( median [ Q1-Q3 ], -3 days [ -1, -9 days ] ) before elective surgery. Approximately 29 % of patients presented with anemia, 46.8 % of these anemic patients were treated with ferric carboxymaltose ( 500-1000 mg ) .In the primary analysis, hemoglobin levels at median were associated with a reduction between the visit in the anesthesia/PBM clinic and the surgery in all nonanemic patients on beginning of medical treatment ( nonanemic patients at median -2.8 g/dL [ -4, -0.9 g/dL ], while anemic patients without IVI<ORGANIZATION> presented with median differences of -0.8 g/dL [ -2, 0 g/dL ] and anemic patients with IVI<ORGANIZATION> of 0 g/dL [ -1.0, 0.5 g/dL ] ). Hemoglobin levels raised best at substitution 22-28 days before surgery ( 0.95 g/dL [ -0.35, 1.18 g/dL ] ). Due to the selection criteria, transfusion rates were high in the cohort. Overall, there was no association between IVI<ORGANIZATION> treatment and the use of RBC<ORGANIZATION> transfusions ( odds ratio for use of RBCs<ORGANIZATION> in anemic patients, no IVI versus IVI: 1.14 ; 95 % confidence interval, 0.72-1.82 ). Patients<PERSON> treated with or without IVI<ORGANIZATION> presented a comparable range of International Classification<ORGANIZATION> of Disease<GPE> codes related to infections. Telephone interviews indicated similar adverse events, health-related events, and infections. Cox<PERSON> regression analysis showed an association between anemia and reduced survival, regardless of IVI<ORGANIZATION>. An anemia clinic within the preanesthesia assessment clinic is a feasible and effective approach to treat preoperative anemia. The IVI<ORGANIZATION> supplementation was safe but was associated with decreased RBC<ORGANIZATION> transfusions in gynecology/obstetric patients only. The conclusions from this retrospective analysis have to be tested in prospective, controlled trials.
