 The need for point-of-care ( POC<ORGANIZATION> ) devices capable of early detecting diseases and monitoring their status, out of a lab environment, has stimulated the development of compact biosensing configurations. While Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance<PERSON> ( LSPR<ORGANIZATION> ) sensing integrated into a state-of-the-art microfluidic chip stands as a promising approach to meet this demand, its implementation into an operating sensing platform capable to detect quantitatively a set of molecular biomarkers in an unknown biological sample is only at its infancy. Here, we present an on-chip LSPR<ORGANIZATION> chip capable to perform automatic, quantitative and multiplexed, screening of biomarkers. We demonstrate its versatility by programming it to detect and quantify in human serum four relevant human serum protein markers associated with breast-cancer.
