 Background Food<GPE> addiction ( FA<ORGANIZATION> ) is a controversial concept, denoting the craving for certain foods. Given the little information available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible relationships between FA<ORGANIZATION> and full-blown and subthreshold psychopathology or eating behaviors in subjects consulting nutritional biologists. Materials and methods Three-hundred and fifty subjects completed the following self-questionnaires: Yale Food Addiction Scale<PERSON> ( YFAS<ORGANIZATION> ), Structured Clinical Interview<PERSON> for Mood Spectrum<PERSON>, Self-Report, Lifetime Version<PERSON> ( MOOD-SR-LT ), Symptom<PERSON> Checklist-90-Revised ( SCL-90-R ), Structured Clinical Interview<PERSON> for Anorexic-Bulimic Spectrum, Self-Report, Lifetime Version<PERSON> ( ABS-SR-LT ). Results Most of the subjects were women ( n = 278 ) and the remaining were 72 men. A large proportion of the subjects ( 77.1 % ) had a YFAS<ORGANIZATION> score < 3 and 22.9 % ≥3, with no difference between men and women. The YFAS<ORGANIZATION> scores ≥3 were significantly and positively related to the all ABS-SR-LT domains, as well as to three dimensions ( Depression, Hypomania<GPE>, Rhythmicity<GPE> ) of the MOOD-SR-LT, and some SCL-90-R domains ( Sensitivity<ORGANIZATION>, Psychoticism<GPE>, General Symptom Index<ORGANIZATION> and Positive Symptom<PERSON> ). Conclusion Our data, while indicating that FA is related to different subthreshold psychopathological domains, in particular, with both depressive and manic symptoms, as well as with rhythmicity of mood spectrum, or with eating subthreshold symptoms, would suggest that it might be a dimension underlying different conditions or symptom clusters.
