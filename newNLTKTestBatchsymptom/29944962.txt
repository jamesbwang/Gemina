 Heartbeat-evoked brain potentials ( HEPs<ORGANIZATION> ) are an index of the cortical reflection of cardiac interoceptive signals. Studies which have examined interoception in adolescents with the use of HEPs<ORGANIZATION> are not known to the authors so far. This study investigated the function of the HEP<ORGANIZATION> as a marker of interoception in adolescents. EEG<ORGANIZATION> and ECG<ORGANIZATION> were recorded in 46 adolescents during a resting condition and during a heartbeat detection task. Participants were asked for confidence in their interoceptive accuracy during heartbeat perception. HEPs<ORGANIZATION> appeared during both conditions, showing maximal activity over frontocentral electrodes in the heartbeat condition, and highest activity over occipital locations in the resting condition. Interoceptive accuracy ( IAc<ORGANIZATION> ) was positively associated with the HEP<ORGANIZATION> at frontocentral locations only for the heartbeat condition. Interoceptive sensibility was not associated with the HEP<ORGANIZATION>. No significant association between IAc<ORGANIZATION> and interoceptive sensibility was revealed. Our results highlight the relevance of the HEP<ORGANIZATION> as a neural marker of interoception in adolescents. Its use as an indicator of vulnerability for affective, physical and mental dysfunctions during adolescence should be exploited in future studies.
