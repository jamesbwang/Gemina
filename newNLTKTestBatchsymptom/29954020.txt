 Despite considerable progress concerning pharmaceutical therapeutic options, many COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients show a markedly reduced quality of life and increased mortality risk. This workshop aimed to identify COPD-specific factors impeding an improved mode of care for patients with COPD<ORGANIZATION>. Such factors are: the generally lower social and educational status of the majority of COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients ; the stigma of COPD<ORGANIZATION> as a self-inflicted disease ( `` smoker 's lung '' ) ; the strict sectoral separation within the German<GPE> health care system. In the second part the workshop tried to identify ways to improve the care of COPD<ORGANIZATION> patients. Use of health information technology, improved communication between care givers and patients as well as between the health care sectors, integrating rehabilitation and establishing self-management education are factors within an integrated patient-centered approach. In summary, an integrated management of the individual patient with COPD<ORGANIZATION> including multi-professional teams should contribute to optimizing the quality of COPD<ORGANIZATION> care.
