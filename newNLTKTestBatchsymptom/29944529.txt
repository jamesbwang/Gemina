 Preventing the recurrence of eyebrow ptosis after brow lift surgery is challenging. We developed a novel technique to maintain elevation of the eyebrow after brow lift surgery. A consecutive sample of patients who underwent brow lift surgery between June 2014 and June 2016 was divided into 2 groups. Group<PERSON> A underwent resection of excess skin during brow lift surgery ; group B underwent the new eyebrow lift technique, which involved resecting skin and the lateral part of the orbital orbicularis oculi muscle, elevating the lower margin of the orbital orbicularis oculi muscle, and suturing it to the orbital periosteum. Eyebrow<PERSON> height and patient satisfaction were measured preoperatively and after surgery. This study included 273 patients. Mean follow-up time was 24.8 months ( range, 6-52 months ). Brow<PERSON> height was similar in groups A and B immediately postoperatively ( group A: 28.37 ± 3.02 mm vs group B: 29.21 ± 2.97 mm ) and at 6 months after operation ( group A: 26.65 ± 2.53 mm vs group B: 27.45 ± 2.77 mm ). At 12 months ( group A: 22.73 ± 2.31 mm vs group B: 25.61 ± 2.62 mm ) and 24 months ( group A: 20.76 ± 2.22 mm vs group B: 24.74 ± 3.10 mm ) after operation, the amount of brow elevation was significantly greater in group B. Two patients in group B experienced supraorbital neuralgia after surgery, which resolved by the 6-month follow-up. At 12 and 24 months after operation, patients in group B were significantly more satisfied with their surgery than patients in group A. Our novel technique is simple and effective for preventing recurrent eyebrow ptosis after brow lift surgery.
