 To examine the prevalence and common themes of unfinished business ( UB ) and its associations with distress among advanced cancer patients. 223 patients from a larger RCT<ORGANIZATION> of Individual<GPE> Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy ( IMCP<ORGANIZATION> ) completed self-report questionnaires that assessed UB<ORGANIZATION> and UB-related distress, hopelessness, desire for hastened death, anxiety and depression, quality of life, spiritual well-being and purpose/meaning. UB themes were identified by qualitative analysis of open-ended data. 161 ( 72 % ) patients reported the presence of UB<ORGANIZATION>. The mean UB-related distress score was 7.01 ( SD<ORGANIZATION> = 2.1 ) out of 10. Results of independent t-tests showed that patients with UB<ORGANIZATION> reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of existential transcendence than patients without UB. Linear<PERSON> regression equations indicated that UB-related distress significantly predicted hopelessness F ( 1,154 ) = 9.54, p < .05, R<ORGANIZATION> UB was both prevalent and distressing in our sample. Findings underscore the need to develop and implement interventions designed to help patients resolve or find solace with UB<ORGANIZATION>.
