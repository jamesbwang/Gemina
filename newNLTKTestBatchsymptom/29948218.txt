 The CUN-BAE ( Cl√≠nica Universidad<ORGANIZATION> de Navarra-Body adiposity estimator ) index is an anthropometric index based on age, sex and body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ) for a refined prediction of body fatness in adults. CUN-BAE may help detect metabolically unhealthy individuals with otherwise normal weight according to BMI<ORGANIZATION> or waist circumference ( WC ). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether CUN-BAE, independent of its components ( BMI<ORGANIZATION>, age and sex ), was associated with cardiometabolic conditions including arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome ( MetS<ORGANIZATION> ). The ENRICA<ORGANIZATION> study was based on a cross-sectional sample of non-institutionalized men and women representative of the adult Spanish<GPE> population. Body<PERSON> weight, height, and WC were measured in all participants. The residual of CUN-BAE ( rCUN-BAE ), i.e. the part of the index not explained by its components, was calculated. The associations of CUN-BAE, rCUN-BAE, BMI<ORGANIZATION> and WC with hypertension, diabetes and MetS<ORGANIZATION> were analysed by multivariate logistic regression, and the Akaike<GPE> information criterion ( AIC<ORGANIZATION> ) was calculated. The sample included 12,122 individuals. rCUN-BAE was associated with hypertension ( OR 1.14, 95 % CI 1.07-1.21 ) and MetS<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 1.48, 1.37-1.60 ), but not with diabetes ( OR 1.05, 0.94-1.16 ). In subjects with a BMI<ORGANIZATION> < 25 kg/m The CUN-BAE index for body fatness was positively associated with hypertension, diabetes and MetS<ORGANIZATION> in adults independent of BMI<ORGANIZATION> or WC. CUN-BAE may help to identify individuals with cardiometabolic conditions beyond BMI<ORGANIZATION>, but this needs to be confirmed in prospective settings.
