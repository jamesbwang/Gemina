 Endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) acts on ET ( A ) and ET<ORGANIZATION> ( B ) receptors and has been implicated in hemorrhagic shock ( shock ). We determined effect of shock and resuscitation by hypertonic saline ( saline ) or centhaquin on ET ( A ) and ET<ORGANIZATION> ( B ) receptor expression. Rats were anesthetized, a pressure catheter was placed in the left femoral artery ; blood was withdrawn from the right femoral artery to bring mean arterial pressure ( MAP<ORGANIZATION> ) to 35 mm Hg for 30 min, resuscitation was performed and 90 min later sacrificed to collect samples for biochemical estimations. Resuscitation with centhaquin decreased blood lactate and increased MAP<ORGANIZATION>. Protein levels of ET<GPE> ( A ) or ET ( B ) receptor were unaltered in the brain, heart, lung and liver following shock or resuscitation. In the abdominal aorta, shock produced an increase ( 140 % ) in ET<GPE> ( A ) expression which was attenuated by saline and centhaquin ; ET ( B ) expression was unaltered following shock but was increased ( 79 % ) by centhaquin. In renal medulla, ET<GPE> ( A ) expression was unaltered following shock, but was decreased ( -61 % ) by centhaquin ; shock produced a decrease ( -34 % ) in ET<GPE> ( B ) expression which was completely attenuated by centhaquin and not saline. Shock<PERSON> induced changes in ET<GPE> ( A ) and ET<ORGANIZATION> ( B ) receptors in the aorta and renal medulla are reversed by centhaquin and may be contributing to its efficacy.
