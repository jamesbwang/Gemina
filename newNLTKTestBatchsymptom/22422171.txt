 Hypocalcemia<GPE> is the most common complication of thyroid surgery. The aim of this study was to determine the early predictive factors of postoperative hypocalcemia and to analyze their efficiency. We performed a retrospective study of 345 consecutive patients who underwent total thyroidectomy at the Endocrine Surgery Department<ORGANIZATION> ( Policlinico<ORGANIZATION> G. Rodolico Hospital of Catania<GPE> ) between January 2011 and November 2013. We measured serum intact parathormone ( iPTH<ORGANIZATION> ) levels preoperatively and 4 h after surgery. The threshold values of hypocalcemia for iPTH<ORGANIZATION> levels and iPTH relative decline were obtained by receiver operating curves ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) analysis. The incidence of hypocalcemia was 32.2 % ( 111 of 345 patients ). Our statistical analysis revealed that hypocalcemia rate was strongly correlated with the lower iPTH<ORGANIZATION> values and greater iPTH<ORGANIZATION> decline ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). The threshold enabling prediction of hypocalcemia were 12,5 pg/mL for iPTH<ORGANIZATION> and 55,7 % for relative iPTH<ORGANIZATION> decline. Patients with iPTH<ORGANIZATION> < 12,5 pg/mL developed hypocalcemia in 58.6 % of cases while those with iPTH<ORGANIZATION> â‰¥12,5 pg/dl in 18.8 %. Among 175 patients with iPTH<ORGANIZATION> relative decline greater than 55,7 % hypocalcemia was diagnosed in 91 cases ( 52 % ), while other 170 patients with iPTH<ORGANIZATION> relative decline less than 55,7 % developed hypocalcemia only in 20 cases ( 11,7 % ). The decreased iPTH<ORGANIZATION> levels and increased iPTH relative decline resulted to be an accurate predictive factors of postoperative hypocalcemia. The early administration of Calcium<GPE> and vitamin D in the high-risk patients should be put on in order to prevent the symptoms of hypocalcemia and to reduce the costs and duration of hospitalization.
