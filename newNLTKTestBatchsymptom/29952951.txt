 That breast carcinoma is the most common malignant lesion in women. This study aimed to differentiate benign from malignant breast lesions and to predict grading of the latter by comparing the diagnostic value of different parameters in intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging ( IVIM-DWI ). Retrospective analysis was performed utilizing imaging and pathological data from 112 patients with 124 breast lesions that underwent IVIM-DWI examination with 3.0 T MRI. Out of 124, 47 benign and 77 malignant lesions were confirmed by pathological diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of f, D<GPE>, and D* value to distinguish benign from malignant breast lesions, was evaluated using pathological results as the gold standard. Correlation between D value and Ki-67 index was evaluated to predict grading of malignant breast lesions. The D value ( 0.99 ± 0.21 ) of patients with malignant lesions was significantly lower than that ( 1.34 ± 0.18 ) of patients harboring benign lesions ( P<PERSON> = .00 ). The D* value ( 7.60 ± 2.10 ) in malignant lesion group was higher than that ( 6.83 ± 2.13 ) of the benign lesion group ( P<PERSON> = .113 ). The f value ( 8.50 ± 2.13 ) in malignant lesion group was remarkably higher than that ( 7.68 ± 1.98 ) of benign lesion group ( P<PERSON> = .035 ). For differential diagnosis of benign from malignant breast lesions, optimal diagnostic threshold of D<GPE> value and f value were 1.21 and 7.86, respectively. The areas of D<GPE> and f values under the ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve were 0.883 and 0.601, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of D<GPE> value were 83.0 %, 86.7 %, and 85.5 %, respectively. Accordingly, those indexes of f value were 64.9 %, 57.4 %, and 62.1 %, respectively. Furthermore, the Ki-67 staining index of malignant lesions was robustly negatively correlated with D<PERSON> value ( r = -0.395, P<PERSON> < .01 ). Concrete parameters of IVIM-DWI can help to improve the specificity and accuracy in differential diagnosis of breast benign and malignant lesions. D value is most relevant and valuable in predicting the grading of malignant breast lesions.
