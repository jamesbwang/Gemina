 Previous research has shown that child-oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD<ORGANIZATION> ) and conduct disorders ( CD ) are associated with parental symptoms of depression, anxiety and/or stress, probably in a bidirectional relationship with mutual influences. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that in child-centered treatment, a decrease in child-oppositional behavior problems constitutes ( at least in part ) a mechanism of change for a subsequent reduction in parental psychopathology. The aim of the present study ( Clinical<PERSON> trials.gov Identifier: NCT01406067 ) was to examine whether the reduction in ODD<ORGANIZATION> symptoms due to child-based cognitive behavioral treatment ( CBT<ORGANIZATION> ) led to a reduction in parental depression, anxiety and stress. Eighty-one boys ( age 6-12 years ) with a diagnosis of ODD/CD were randomized either to a cognitive behavioral intervention group or an educational play group ( acting as control group ). Mediation analyses were conducted using path analysis. The stronger reduction in child ODD<ORGANIZATION> symptoms in the CBT<ORGANIZATION> group compared to the control group led to a decrease in parental depression and stress, as indicated by significant indirect effects ( ab = 0.07 and ab = 0.08, p < 0.05 ). The proposed model for mechanisms of change was, therefore, confirmed for two of the three outcome parameters. Parental<ORGANIZATION> psychopathology and stress can be modified by child-centered CBT<ORGANIZATION>. The preceding reduction in ODD<ORGANIZATION> symptoms acts as a mediator for at least some of the changes in parental depression and stress. However, due to some limitations of the study, other possible explanations for the results found can not be completely ruled out and are, therefore, discussed.
