 Vascular<GPE> sclerosis mostly occurs in arteries and is mainly related to anatomic structure and hemodynamics of artery. This study aimed to investigate effects of arterial blood on vein wall and explore differences of composition between arterial and venous blood.Ultrasound was used to examine the distal venous structure of arteriovenous fistula in uremia patients. Immunohistochemistry<PERSON> was used to study the pathology of the distal vein. Twelve patients were divided into control group and trial group. Patients<PERSON> received an arteriovenous fistula within 1 month in control group. Patients<PERSON> had undergone this surgery â‰¥2 years before in the trial group. Blood samples were collected from the aortic, arterial, and venous vessels of 51 patients who had taken coronary angiography and analyzed with blood routine rest, biochemical, and immunological measures to compare the differences of blood composition between artery and vein. This study was registered with the China<GPE> Clinical Trial Center<PERSON> website under registration number ChiCTR-OOC-16008085.In the trial group, the vascular wall of distal veins of fistula were thickened and hardened. No significant differences of blood composition were found between the aortic and radial arterial blood. However, the differences in the percentages of lymphocytes and neutrophils between arterial and venous blood were significant ( Pa = .0095, Pb<PERSON> = .01 ) .Under smooth hemodynamic conditions, arterial blood caused hardening of the venous wall. Arterial<PERSON> and venous blood differed in the percentage of lymphocyte and neutrophils. This may contribute to the vascular sclerosis that is observed in arteries more often than veins.
