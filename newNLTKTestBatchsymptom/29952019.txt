 Infantile hemangiomas are the most common tumor of childhood and undergo rapid growth during early infancy followed by gradual involution. After involution, residual lesions sometimes remain. Oral propranolol usually induces earlier involution and redness reduction of infantile hemangiomas. However, the optimal treatment duration is unknown and infantile hemangiomas sometimes recur after cessation of treatment. We report three Japanese<GPE> patients with recurrent infantile hemangiomas on their cheek. These patients were a 1-month-old female baby with a superficial infantile hemangioma, a 3-month-old female baby with a mixed infantile hemangioma and a 4-month-old male baby with a mixed infantile hemangioma. Two of them also received pulsed dye laser treatment. They did not reach complete or nearly complete resolution of infantile hemangiomas at week 25. These patients experienced regrowth of their infantile hemangioma after 20 months of age and took propranolol after the age of 24 months. There were no severe adverse effects. Propranolol may not only be therapeutic but also prophylactic. Patients with infantile hemangiomas who have taken oral propranolol should be followed up at least 6 months after cessation of treatment, especially infantile hemangiomas on the cheek, and those with partial response to propranolol may require close attention in prolonged growth.
