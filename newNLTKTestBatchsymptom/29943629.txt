 OBJECTIVE To assess differences in skin shrinkage between grossly visible tumor and grossly normal marginal skin of dogs for cutaneous mast cell tumors ( MCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) excised with curative intent and to determine an equation to estimate postexcisional gross tumor margins from preexcisional measurements and vice versa. SAMPLE 19 cytologically confirmed and surgically excised cutaneous MCTs<ORGANIZATION> obtained from dogs. PROCEDURES Tumors<ORGANIZATION> were measured in craniocaudal and dorsoventral directions before excision, immediately after excision, and after fixation in formalin. Both grossly visible tumor and surrounding grossly normal skin that comprised the surgical margin were measured at each time point. Percentage of shrinkage was compared among time points and between the tumor and surrounding grossly normal skin. Patient<PERSON> and histopathologic variables were correlated to skin shrinkage. RESULTS Overall shrinkage was 17.70 %. The amount of shrinkage within the grossly visible tumor ( 4.45 % ) was less than that within the surrounding grossly normal skin ( 24.42 % ). Most of the shrinkage occurred immediately after excision. There was no effect of age, sex, completeness of excision, or degree of edema. Accuracy of an equation to estimate postexcisional margins from preexcisional measurements was only 18.4 %. CONCLUSIONS<ORGANIZATION> AND CLINICAL<ORGANIZATION> RELEVANCE Grossly evident MCTs<ORGANIZATION> of dogs shrunk less than did the grossly normal surrounding skin. Although an equation to estimate postexcisional margins from preexcisional measurements could be derived, it likely would need to contain additional variables not included in the study reported here. Until such an equation exists, care must be used when extrapolating surgical margins from histologic margins and vice versa.
