 Germline<GPE> mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase B ( SDHB<ORGANIZATION> ) gene predispose to hereditary paraganglioma ( PGL<ORGANIZATION> ) syndrome type 4. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of treatment strategies for patients with head and neck paraganglioma ( HNPGL<ORGANIZATION> ) carrying SDHB<ORGANIZATION> germline mutations. This was a retrospective evaluation of patients with HNPGL<ORGANIZATION> carrying SDHB<ORGANIZATION> germline mutations in the Netherlands<GPE>. In a Dutch<GPE> nationwide cohort study of SDHB<ORGANIZATION> germline mutation carriers, 54 patients with a total of 62 HNPGLs were identified. Forty-one of 54 patients ( 76 per cent ) visited the outpatient clinic because of associated complaints. Eight patients ( 15 per cent ) had multiple PGLs<ORGANIZATION>. One patient ( 2 per cent ) developed a phaeochromocytoma and three ( 6 per cent ) developed a malignant PGL<ORGANIZATION>. Twenty-seven patients ( 50 per cent ) had an operation for their HNPGL<ORGANIZATION> and 15 ( 28 per cent ) received radiotherapy. Three patients with HNPGL<ORGANIZATION> ( 6 per cent ) were diagnosed with additional non-paraganglionic tumours. If an SDHB<ORGANIZATION> germline mutation is identified in a patient with HNPGL<ORGANIZATION>, the clinician should be aware of the variable manifestations of the SDHB-linked tumour syndrome, the risk of catecholamine excess, concurrent phaeochromocytoma, and association with non-paraganglionic tumours.
