 Boswellia<GPE> dalzielii is a tall tree ( more than 13 m high ) that produces aromatic white flowers. This plant is commonly used in indigenous medicine across Africa<GPE> against diarrhea, malaria, vomiting, inflammation and arthritis. The present study focuses on the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritis potential of methanol extract of Boswellia<GPE> dalzielii ( BDME<ORGANIZATION> ). Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in inflammatory models induced by carrageenan, arachidonic acid, histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin and bradykinin. Anti-arthritis activity was measured using complete Freund<PERSON> 's adjuvant model. Intracellular and extracellular ROS<ORGANIZATION> production and proliferation of T-cells were evaluated using chemiluminescence and liquid scintillation counter techniques, respectively. TNF-α and IL-1β production were assessed using ELISA<ORGANIZATION> and MTT<ORGANIZATION> assay performed for cytotoxicity. BDME<ORGANIZATION> revealed a significant anti-inflammatory effect by preventing the development of edema caused by carrageenan, arachidonic acid, histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin and bradykinin. For anti-arthritic properties of BDME<ORGANIZATION>, the results showed a significant reduction of the joint diameter and a decrease in pain in the treated animals. The extract also showed a noticeable systemic effect, maintaining the values of the evaluated parameters close to normal in treated rats with an inhibition of joint destruction as shown in histopathological analysis. Furthermore, BDME<ORGANIZATION> exhibited significant inhibition of extracellular and intracellular ROS<ORGANIZATION> production. Still, the extract displayed significant inhibitory activity on T-cell proliferation as well as a reduced production of TNF-α and IL-1β. Boswellia<GPE> dalzielii could be considered as a promising tract in the prevention and/or management of inflammatory diseases.
