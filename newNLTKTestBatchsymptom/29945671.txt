 Direct<GPE> intra-articular injection ( DIAI<ORGANIZATION> ) of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) is a promising technique for cartilage repair. However, the repair process was hindered by the absence of scaffold and poor cell-matrix interactions. In this study, we developed a pericellular collagen I coating ( PCC<ORGANIZATION> ) on MSCs<ORGANIZATION>. The overall performances of MSC-PCC homing, chondrogenic differentiation, and cartilage regeneration have been comprehensively evaluated in a New Zealand<GPE> rabbit model. Firstly, we examined the morphology and physical characteristics of PCC<ORGANIZATION>. Secondly, MSC<ORGANIZATION> ex-vivo cartilage slice adhesion and in-vivo cartilage defect homing were observed using multiscale methods. Thirdly, the precartilage condensation of cell pellets formed by aggregation of MSCs<ORGANIZATION> was examined to evaluate the cartilage-inducing potential of PCC<ORGANIZATION>. Finally, the cartilage regeneration by DIAI<ORGANIZATION> of PCC-coated MSCs was observed and scored macroscopically and histologically. In general, the cell adhesion and homing assay revealed that PCC<ORGANIZATION> facilitated MSC<ORGANIZATION> adhesion on cartilage slices, enhancing MSC<ORGANIZATION> homing and retention to cartilage defect. This increased homing ratio was accompanied by an increasing cell-cell contact. Compared with naked MSCs<ORGANIZATION>, the cell pellets formed by PCC-coated MSCs exhibited more evident appearance of condensation. In pellets, cell-cell interaction has been significantly stimulated, inducing the expression of condensation marker N-cadherin, and subsequent chondrogenic marker collagen II and aggrecan. By 12 weeks after DIAI<ORGANIZATION>, cartilage defects have been repaired by MSCs<ORGANIZATION> to varying degrees. Overall, PCC<ORGANIZATION> significantly enhances the quality of cartilage regeneration judging from macroscopic observation, ICRS<ORGANIZATION> score, histological examination, and collagen type I, II<ORGANIZATION>, and X immunohistochemical staining. The capacity and viability of MSCs<ORGANIZATION> can be enhanced by collagen I coating, which provides cues for enhancing cell homing and differentiation. Our method provides a novel strategy for stem cell therapy.
