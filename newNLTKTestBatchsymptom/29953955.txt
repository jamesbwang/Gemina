 The electrophysiological features and roles of persistent left superior vena cava ( PLSVC<ORGANIZATION> ) in supraventricular tachycardia ( SVT<ORGANIZATION> ) are not known. To elucidate the electrophysiological features and roles of PLSVC<ORGANIZATION> in patients with SVT<ORGANIZATION>. We included 37 patients ( age: 43.5 ± 17.1 years ; men: 35.1 % ) with PLSVC<ORGANIZATION> and 510 patients ( age: 43.9 ± 18.8 years ; men: 48.2 % ) without PLSVC who underwent an electrophysiological study for SVT<ORGANIZATION>. The number of induced tachycardias, location of the slow pathway ( SP ) or accessory pathway ( AP<ORGANIZATION> ), and radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA<ORGANIZATION> ) outcomes were compared between patients with and without PLSVC<ORGANIZATION>. During RFCA<ORGANIZATION> of the left AP<ORGANIZATION>, a coronary sinus ( CS ) catheter was placed into the left superior vena cava ( LSVC<ORGANIZATION> group ) or the great cardiac vein ( GCV<ORGANIZATION> group ). The RFCA<ORGANIZATION> outcomes were compared between the groups. In the patients with PLSVC<ORGANIZATION>, 40 tachycardias were induced: atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia ( AVNRT<ORGANIZATION> ) ( n = 19 ), atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia ( n = 17 ), and focal atrial tachycardia ( n = 4 ). Among patients with AVNRT<ORGANIZATION>, an SP in the CS<ORGANIZATION> was significantly more frequent in patients with PLSVC<ORGANIZATION> than in those without PLSVC<ORGANIZATION> ( 47.4 % versus 3.8 %, P<PERSON> < .001 ). In patients with the left AP<ORGANIZATION>, the number of RFCA<ORGANIZATION> attempts and recurrence were lower in the GCV<ORGANIZATION> group than in the LSVC<ORGANIZATION> group. An SP in the CS<ORGANIZATION> is prevalent in patients with AVNRT<ORGANIZATION> and PLSVC<ORGANIZATION>. It is useful to place a CS catheter into the great cardiac vein in patients with a left AP<ORGANIZATION> and PLSVC<ORGANIZATION>.
