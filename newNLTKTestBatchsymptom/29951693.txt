 This pilot study was performed to investigate safety and local tumor control following transarterial embolization with small-size particles loaded with irinotecan ( DEB-IRI ) in patients with colorectal liver metastases ( CRLM<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients with pretreated CRLM<ORGANIZATION> with mono- or bilobar lesions involving less than 60 % of the liver parenchyma and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group<PERSON> performance status 0 or 1 underwent superselective DEB-IRI embolization with 40 Âµm diameter embolic microspheres. Eighteen patients ( 11 males, 7 females, median age 61 years ) underwent 80 embolization procedures ( mean 4.4, range 2-12 per patient ). No serious adverse events were reported within 30 days. A total of 39 treatment-related AEs<ORGANIZATION> occurred across all embolization procedures. No G4 or G5 treatment-related AEs<ORGANIZATION> occurred. Local<PERSON> tumor control, defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease, was achieved in 16/18 ( 88.9 % ), 7/17 ( 41.2 % ), and 3/17 ( 17.6 % ) patients at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Median<PERSON> liver progression-free survival was 5.9 months ( range 27-409 days ), and median overall survival was 13.5 months. In this small series, DEB-IRI embolization with small beads was demonstrated a safe procedure in the treatment of patients with CRLM<ORGANIZATION>. The promising results in terms of liver-specific progression-free survival and overall survival reported deserve further confirmation in larger prospective trials. Level 4, case series.
