 A simple method to rapidly customize and to also mass produce oral dosage forms is arguably a current bottleneck in the development of modern personalized medicine. Specifically, delayed-release mechanisms with well-controlled dosage profiles for combinations of traditional Chinese<GPE> herbal extracts and Western<GPE> medications are not well established. Herein<PERSON>, we demonstrate a novel multi-drug loaded membrane sandwich with structures infused with ibuprofen ( IBU<ORGANIZATION> ) and ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide ( GLP<ORGANIZATION> ) using electrohydrodynamic ( EHD<ORGANIZATION> ) 3D printing and electrospinning techniques. The resulting flexible membrane consists of micro-scaled, multi-layered cellulose acetate ( CA ) membranes loaded with IBU<ORGANIZATION> in either the shape of concentric squares or circles, as the top and bottom layer of a sandwich structure. In between the CA-IBU layers are randomly electrospun ( ES ) polyvinyl pyrrolidone ( PVP<ORGANIZATION> ) layers loaded with GLP<ORGANIZATION>. The complete fibrous membrane sandwich can be folded and embedded into a 0-size capsule to achieve oral compliance. Simulated in vitro testing of gastric and intestinal fluids demonstrated a triphasic release profile. There was an immediate release of GLP<ORGANIZATION> after gastric juices dissolved the capsule shell and the PVP<ORGANIZATION>, followed by the short-term release of 60 % of the IBU<ORGANIZATION> within an hour afterwards, and the remaining IBU<ORGANIZATION> was sustained released following a Fickian<GPE> diffusion profile. In summary, this multi-drug ( both hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic ) oral system with precision-designed structures should enable personalized therapeutic dosing.
