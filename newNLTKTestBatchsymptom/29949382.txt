 Cardiac<GPE> fibroblasts are critical mediators of fibrotic remodeling in the failing heart and transform into myofibroblasts in the presence of pro-fibrotic factors such as TGF-Î². Myocardial fibrosis worsens cardiac function accelerating the progression to decompensated heart failure ( HF ). We investigated the effects of a novel inhibitor ( i.e., NM922<ORGANIZATION>, NovoMedix<ORGANIZATION>, San Diego<PERSON>, CA ) of the conversion of normal fibroblasts to the myofibroblast phenotype in the setting of pressure overload induced HF. NM922<ORGANIZATION> inhibited fibroblasts- myofibroblasts transformation in vitro via reducing the activation of FAK-Akt-P70S6K and STAT3/4E-BP1 pathway as well as via induction of COX-2. NM922<ORGANIZATION> preserved left ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction ( p & lt ; 0.05 vs. VEH<ORGANIZATION> ) and significantly attenuated TAC-induced LV dilation and hypertrophy ( p & lt ; 0.05 compared to VEH<ORGANIZATION> ). NM922 significantly ( p & lt ; 0.05 ) inhibited fibroblast activation as evidenced by reduced myofibroblast counts per mm2 tissue area. Picrosirus Red<PERSON> staining demonstrated that NM922<ORGANIZATION> reduced ( p & lt ; 0.05 ) interstitial fibrosis compared to mice receiving Vehicle<GPE> ( VEH<ORGANIZATION> ). Similarly, NM922<ORGANIZATION> hearts had lower mRNA<ORGANIZATION> levels ( p & lt ; 0.05 ) of collagen I and III<ORGANIZATION>, lysyl oxidase, and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF<ORGANIZATION> ) at 16 wks post-TAC. Treatment with NM922<ORGANIZATION> following the onset of cardiac hypertrophy and HF<ORGANIZATION> resulted in attenuated myocardial collagen formation and adverse remodeling with preservation of LVEF<ORGANIZATION>. Future studies are aimed at further elucidation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which this novel anti-fibrotic agent protects the failing heart.
