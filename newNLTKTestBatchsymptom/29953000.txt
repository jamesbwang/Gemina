 This retrospective study evaluated the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES<ORGANIZATION> ) for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain ( EAP<ORGANIZATION> ) .A total of 154 patients with EAP<ORGANIZATION> were included and were divided into 2 groups in this retrospective study. Eighty-three patients were assigned a treatment group, and underwent NMES<ORGANIZATION> therapy, while 71 subjects in the control group were at waiting list. The primary outcome of pain was measured by the numerical rating scale ( NRS<ORGANIZATION> ) and the Endometriosis Symptom<ORGANIZATION> Severity scale ( ESSS<ORGANIZATION> ). The secondary outcome was quality of life, measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ). All outcomes were measured before and after 5-week and 10-week treatment. Moreover, we also recorded the adverse events in this study.After 5-week treatment, no significant differences in all outcome measurements were found between the 2 groups. However, after 10-week treatment, NMES<ORGANIZATION> therapy exerted better outcomes in NRS<GPE> ( P<PERSON> = .02 ), ESSS<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> = .04 ), and SF-36 [ Physical Component Summary ( PCS<ORGANIZATION> ), P<PERSON> < .01 ; Mental<ORGANIZATION> Component Summary ( MCS<ORGANIZATION> ), P<PERSON> < .01 ], compared with the patients at the waiting list. Moreover, no significant differences of all adverse events were found between the 2 groups, although mild and acceptable adverse events occurred in the treatment group.This study demonstrated that NMES<ORGANIZATION> is effective for treating patients with EAP<ORGANIZATION>.
