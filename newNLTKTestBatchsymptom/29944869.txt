 UDP-glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs<ORGANIZATION> ) are drug-metabolizing enzymes essential for the metabolism of endogenous substrates and xenobiotics. Molecular characteristics of UGTs<ORGANIZATION> have been extensively investigated in humans, but in cynomolgus macaques, a non-human primate species widely used in drug metabolism studies, remain to be investigated. In this study, 12 UGT1A cDNAs ( UGT1A1<ORGANIZATION>, 1A2, 1A4A, 1A4B, 1A5A, 1A5B, 1A5C, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 ) were isolated and characterized in cynomolgus macaques. UGT1A5C<ORGANIZATION> cDNA<ORGANIZATION> did not contain a complete coding region due to nonsense mutations, and was excluded from further analysis. Amino<PERSON> acid sequences of all 11 cynomolgus UGT1As<ORGANIZATION> had high sequence identities ( 92-95 % ) with human UGT1As<ORGANIZATION> and were phylogenetically close to human UGT1As<ORGANIZATION>. These cynomolgus UGT1A<ORGANIZATION> genes shared exons 2-5, and contained a variable exon 1 unique to each gene, similar to human UGT1A<ORGANIZATION> genes. Moreover, cynomolgus and human UGT1A<ORGANIZATION> gene clusters were located in corresponding regions in the genome. Among the 10 tissue types analyzed, cynomolgus UGT1A<ORGANIZATION> mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in the liver, jejunum, and/or kidney, the drug-metabolizing organs, similar to human UGT1As<ORGANIZATION>. Among these 11 cynomolgus UGT1A<ORGANIZATION> mRNAs, cynomolgus UGT1A9<ORGANIZATION> and UGT1A10<ORGANIZATION> mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in the liver/kidney and jejunum, respectively. Cynomolgus<PERSON> liver microsomes and UGT1A<ORGANIZATION> proteins catalyzed glucuronidation of the substrates human UGT1As<ORGANIZATION> catalyze, including 4-methylumbelliferone, 4-nitrophenol, estradiol, trifluoperazine, serotonin, and propofol, although trifluoperazine glucuronidation was not catalyzed by any cynomolgus UGT1A<ORGANIZATION> proteins. These results suggest that cynomolgus UGT1As are functional enzymes with molecular similarities to human UGT1As<ORGANIZATION>.
