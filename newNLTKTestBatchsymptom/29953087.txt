 The phenomenon of dome-shaped macula ( DSM<ORGANIZATION> ) constitutes protrusion of membranes of the posterior pole of the eye toward the vitreous body due to local thickening of sclera layers. The phenomenon was detected using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography ( EDI-OCT ). In uncomplicated forms of DSM<ORGANIZATION>, all layers of the retina are contiguous, but the setting of DSM<ORGANIZATION> can involve a number of pathological conditions causing decrease in vision. One of the most often described concurrent conditions in DSM<ORGANIZATION> is serous retinal detachment ( SRD<ORGANIZATION> ). Such complicated forms of DSM<ORGANIZATION> are often masked as a non-pigmented neoplasm of the choroid, in particular hemangioma ( HC ). To demonstrate the possibilities of differential diagnostics of DSM<ORGANIZATION> with HC using modern instrumental diagnostic methods. The study involved two clinical cases of patients with DSM<ORGANIZATION> and HC<ORGANIZATION>, who underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examination including EDI-OCT and OCT<ORGANIZATION> angiography, fluorescent angiography ( FA<ORGANIZATION> ), indocyanine-green angiography ( ICG<ORGANIZATION> ) and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ). The most simple and highly informative method for differential diagnostic of DSM<ORGANIZATION> with HC<ORGANIZATION> is currently EDI-OCT. In difficult differential diagnostic cases, it is recommended to use FA<ORGANIZATION> and MRI<ORGANIZATION>. Additionally, for identification of the cause of SRD<ORGANIZATION> in DSM<ORGANIZATION>, OCT-angiography and ICG-angiography can be used. Thus, diagnostics of DSM<ORGANIZATION> is difficult today primarily because of the low awareness of ophthalmologists about the presence of such macula pathology. Detection of this anatomical feature by means of ophthalmoscopy alone can be difficult and requires special skills and experience. The use of EDI-OCT, as well as FA<ORGANIZATION> and MRI<ORGANIZATION> in difficult differential diagnostic cases, and correct interpretation of the obtained data can help avoid diagnostic errors.
