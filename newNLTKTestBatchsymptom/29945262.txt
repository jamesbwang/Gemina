 Lip<GPE> augmentation procedures with hyaluronic acid dermal fillers have become increasingly popular worldwide because full lips are often considered beautiful and youthful. The goal of a lip augmentation procedure is to create smooth lips with adequate volume and a natural appearance. Various techniques for lip augmentation have been utilized and described. In the four-point injection technique, the lips were divided equally into right side and left side. Four entry points were made above the vermilion border for the upper lip and below the vermilion border for the lower lip. The filler was administered with a fanning technique through each entry point. Between January 2017 and November 2017, 50 female patients underwent a nonsurgical lip augmentation procedure with injectable fillers using this technique. Forty-five patients ( 90 % ) reported that they were satisfied or extremely satisfied with their lip enhancement procedure. No serious complications were observed. The advantages of this technique are reducing the risk of complications like erythema, edema, and vascular injuries, and providing easy access to injection sites.
