 The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide ( AcmH2<ORGANIZATION> ) reacted with [ ( η6-p-cymene ) RuCl<ORGANIZATION> ( μ-Cl ) ] 2 to afford [ ( η6-p-cymene ) RuCl2 ( κN-AcmH2 ) ], 1A, in near-quantitative yield. In methanol, 1A exists in equilibrium with 1B, being probably a coordination isomer, as established by VT<ORGANIZATION> 1H-EXSY NMR<ORGANIZATION> spectroscopy. DFT<ORGANIZATION> calculations pointed to a higher stability of 1A with respect to 1B. [ ( η6-p-cymene ) RuCl<ORGANIZATION> ( κ2N<ORGANIZATION>, N'-AcmH ) ], 2, was obtained in 86 % yield from [ ( η6-p-cymene ) RuCl<ORGANIZATION> ( μ-Cl ) ] 2 and AcmH2<ORGANIZATION> in the presence of NaOH<ORGANIZATION>. The reactions of 2 with AgNO3<ORGANIZATION> ( in water ), pta/AgNO3 or pta/AgOTf/Et3N ( in methanol ) afforded the nitrate-coordinated complex [ ( η6-p-cymene ) Ru ( κO-NO3 ) ( κ2N, N'-AcmH ) ], 3, the salt [ ( η6-p-cymene ) Ru ( κ2N<ORGANIZATION>, N'-AcmH ) ( κP-pta ) ] NO3<ORGANIZATION>, [ 4 ] NO3, and the zwitterion [ ( η6-p-cymene ) Ru ( κ2N<ORGANIZATION>, N'-Acm ) ( κP-pta ) ], 5, respectively, in high yields ( pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphatricyclo [ 3.3.1.1 ] decane ). The reactions of 5 with Brønsted<ORGANIZATION> acids yielded the protonated-pta species [ ( η6-p-cymene ) Ru ( κ2N<ORGANIZATION>, N'-Acm ) ( κP-ptaH ) ] X [ 6 ] X ( X = NO3, TsO<ORGANIZATION> ). All compounds were fully characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods, and the structures of 1A, 2 and 5 were elucidated by X-ray diffraction. The stability of the compounds was investigated in aqueous media and 2 and 5 were evaluated for their cytotoxicity towards human ovarian A2780 and A2780cisR<ORGANIZATION> cancer cells and non-tumorigenic HEK-293 cells.
