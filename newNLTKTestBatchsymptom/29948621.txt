 The frequency of invasive fungal diseases ( IFDs<ORGANIZATION> ) has increased in recent years. Within a context where both treatments and guidelines are fast evolving, we aim to shed new light on IFD<ORGANIZATION> management in hematologic departments in France<GPE>. A multicenter cross-sectional observational study was prospectively conducted in 24 French<GPE> centers in September and October 2013. Four hundred ninety-four hospitalized children and adult patients suffering from hematologic malignancy were enrolled: 147 ( 30 % ) were allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT<ORGANIZATION> ) recipients, 131 ( 27 % ) were patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS<ORGANIZATION> ), 71 ( 14 % ) were patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who did not undergo allogeneic HSCT<ORGANIZATION>, and the 145 ( 29 % ) remaining patients did not belong to the three above groups. Two hundred forty-six patients ( 50 % ) received antifungal treatment, which was prophylactic in 187 ( 76 % ) treated patients. These rates were similar across all groups ( 63-80 % ). Patients<PERSON> received prophylaxis with an azole ( 79 % ), intravenous amphotericin B formulation ( 10 % ), echinocandin ( 9 % ), or two combination drugs ( 2 % ). Results indicate that prophylaxis is the leading antifungal strategy in French<GPE> hematology units, regardless of the disease condition, representing 76 % of prescriptions for antifungal therapy.
