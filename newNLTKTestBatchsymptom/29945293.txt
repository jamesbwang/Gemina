 To compare and evaluate the reliability, validity, feasibility, clinical utility, and nurses ' preference of the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised ( PIPP-R ), the Neonatal Pain<ORGANIZATION>, Agitation<PERSON>, and Sedation Scale<ORGANIZATION> ( N-PASS ), and the Neonatal Infant Acute Pain Assessment Scale<ORGANIZATION> ( NIAPAS<ORGANIZATION> ) used for procedural pain in ventilated neonates. Procedural pain is a common phenomenon but is undermanaged and underassessed in hospitalized neonates. Information for clinician selecting pain measurements to improve neonatal care and outcomes are still limited. A prospective observational study and adheres to the relevant EQUATOR<ORGANIZATION> guidelines. A total of 1080 pain assessments were made at 90 neonates by two nurses independently, using three scales viewing three phases of videotaped painful ( arterial blood sampling ) and non-painful procedures ( diaper change ). Internal<ORGANIZATION> consistency, inter-rater reliability, discriminant validity, concurrent validity and convergent validity of scales were analyzed. Feasibility, clinical utility, and nurses ' preference of scales were also investigated. All three scales showed excellent inter-raters coefficients ( from 0.991 to 0.992 ) and good internal consistency ( 0.733 for the PIPP-R, 0.837 for the N-PASS and 0.836 for the NIAPAS<ORGANIZATION>, respectively ). Scores of painful and nonpainful procedures on the three scales changed significantly across the phases. There was a strong correlation between the three scales with adequate limits of agreement. The mean scores of the N-PASS for feasibility and utility were significantly higher than those of the NIAPAS<ORGANIZATION>, but not significantly higher than those of the PIPP-R. The N-PASS was mostly preferred by 55.9 % of the nurses, followed by the NIAPAS<ORGANIZATION> ( 23.5 % ) and the PIPP-R ( 20.6 % ). The three scales are all reliable and valid, but the N-PASS and the NIAPAS<ORGANIZATION> performs better in reliability. The N-PASS appears to be a better choice for frontier nurses to assess procedural pain in ventilated neonates based on its good feasibility, utility, and nurses ' preference.
