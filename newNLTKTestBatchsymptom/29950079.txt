 To establish the fingerprints of biles of pig, cattle and sheep, HPLC<ORGANIZATION> was used with Acclaim™ RSLC 120 C₁₈ column ( 3.0 mm×100 mm, 2.2 μm, 120 Å ), the column temperature 35 °C, acetonitrile-1 % perchloric acid as mobile phase, gradient elution, 0.5 mL·min⁻¹ flow rate, and detection wavelength at 200 nm. The fingerprint was generated by using Similarity Evaluation Software<ORGANIZATION> of Chromatographic Fingerprint<ORGANIZATION> of Chinese Medicine<GPE> ( 2004A Edition ). The fingerprint peaks were identified by reference substances and verified by ELSD<ORGANIZATION> and LC-MS/MS. Then, the biles of pig, cattle and sheep were detected to contain 14, 9 and 8 common fingerprint peaks respectively, and the similarity was greater than 0.92. To analyze each technical parameter, GHDCA<ORGANIZATION> in pig bile and TCA<ORGANIZATION> in cattle and sheep bile were selected as reference peak. The precision, repeatability and stability all meet the requirements of fingerprint establishment. The RSD<ORGANIZATION> of the relative retention time of the fingerprint peaks was less than 1.5 %, and the RSD<ORGANIZATION> of the relative peak area was less than 5 %. The fingerprint peaks in pig bile were THDCA<ORGANIZATION>, TCDCA<ORGANIZATION>, GHDCA<ORGANIZATION> and GCDCA<ORGANIZATION>, and TCA<ORGANIZATION>, TCDCA<ORGANIZATION>, GCA<ORGANIZATION>, GCDCA<ORGANIZATION> and GDCA<ORGANIZATION> in cattle and sheep bile. The main components of pig, cattle and sheep bile were conjugated bile acids, but there were significant differences in bile acids between pig bile and cattle, sheep biles. The HPLC<ORGANIZATION> method established in this paper is simple, rapid and reproducible, and could be applied to the identification and quality control of biles.
