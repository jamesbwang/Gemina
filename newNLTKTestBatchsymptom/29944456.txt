 Health-related quality of life ( HRQL<ORGANIZATION> ) preference-based scores are used to assess the health of populations and patients and for cost-effectiveness analyses. The National Institutes<ORGANIZATION> of Health<PERSON> Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS<ORGANIZATION> To produce societal preference-based scores for 7 PROMIS domains: Cognitive Function-Abilities, Depression<GPE>, Fatigue<PERSON>, Pain Interference<PERSON>, Physical Function<PERSON>, Sleep Disturbance<PERSON>, and Ability<ORGANIZATION> to Participate in Social Roles<GPE> and Activities. Online<PERSON> survey of a US<GSP> nationally representative sample ( n = 983 ). Preferences for PROMIS<ORGANIZATION> health states were elicited with the standard gamble to obtain both single-attribute scoring functions for each of the 7 PROMIS domains and a multiplicative multiattribute utility ( scoring ) function. The 7 single-attribute scoring functions were fit using isotonic regression with linear interpolation. The multiplicative multiattribute summary function estimates utilities for PROMIS<ORGANIZATION> multiattribute health states on a scale where 0 is the utility of being dead and 1 the utility of `` full health. '' The lowest possible score is -0.022 ( for a state viewed as worse than dead ), and the highest possible score is 1. The online survey systematically excludes some subgroups, such as the visually impaired and illiterate. A generic societal preference-based scoring system is now available for all studies using these 7 PROMIS health domains.
