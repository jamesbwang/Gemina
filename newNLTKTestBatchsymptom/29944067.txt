 Purpose The purpose of this study was to describe how a community-academic partnership developed and implemented a shared goal of evaluating the impact of a large community-based diabetes self-management program on diabetes care and mental health outcomes. Methods Data<ORGANIZATION> came from the YMCA<ORGANIZATION> of Greater Richmond Diabetes Control Program<ORGANIZATION> ( DCP<ORGANIZATION> ), a 12-week, group-format self-management program led by lay health coaches. Adults with type 2 diabetes ( N = 312 ) completed baseline assessments of sociodemographic characteristics, diabetes history, and mental health. Four outcomes were assessed pre- and post-DCP on 141 participants who completed the program: hemoglobin A1C ( A1C ), weight, depressive symptoms ( Patient Health<ORGANIZATION> Questionnaire-8 ), and glucose monitoring. The team worked with a Community Advisory Board<ORGANIZATION> throughout the research process. Results The DCP<ORGANIZATION> had wide geographic reach, including lower-income neighborhoods. The average age of the participants was 53.9 years, 71.4 % were female, and 69 % were African American<ORGANIZATION>. During the DCP<ORGANIZATION>, A1C<PERSON> declined from 8.4 % to 7.6 % ( P<PERSON> < .001 ), but weight was unchanged ( 229.2 vs 227.9, P<PERSON> < .282 ). During the DCP<ORGANIZATION>, the proportion of participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms declined from 32.4 % to 15.5 % ( P<PERSON> < .001 ), and frequency of glucose monitoring significantly increased. Conclusions The YMCA<ORGANIZATION> of Greater Richmond<ORGANIZATION> DCP has wide reach into underserved populations throughout the metropolitan area. This program is effective at improving diabetes self-management and mental health. Findings have implications for supporting academic-community partnerships to address diabetes disparities.
