 Few data exist regarding predictors of rapid aortic root dilation and referral for aortic surgery in Marfan<GPE> syndrome ( MFS<ORGANIZATION> ). To identify independent predictors of the rate of aortic root ( AoR<ORGANIZATION> ) dilation and referral for aortic surgery, we investigated the data from the Pediatric Heart Network<ORGANIZATION> randomized trial of atenolol versus losartan in young patients with MFS<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> were analyzed from the echocardiograms at 0, 12, 24, and 36 months read in the core laboratory of 608 trial subjects, aged 6 months to 25 years, who met original Ghent criteria and had an AoR<ORGANIZATION> z-score ( AoRz<ORGANIZATION> ) > 3. Repeated measures linear and logistic regressions were used to determine multivariable predictors of AoR<ORGANIZATION> dilation. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine cut-points in AoR<ORGANIZATION> dilation predicting referral for aortic surgery. Multivariable analysis showed rapid AoR<ORGANIZATION> dilation as defined by change in AoRz/year > 90th percentile was associated with older age, higher sinotubular junction z-score, and atenolol use ( R
