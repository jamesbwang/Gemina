 Tissue<GPE> biopsy is commonly used in cancer diagnosis and molecular studies. However, advanced skills are required for determining cancerous status of biopsies and tissue origin of tumor for cancerous ones. Correct classification is essential for downstream experiment design and result interpretation, especially in molecular cancer studies. Methods<ORGANIZATION> for accurate classification of cancerous status and tissue origin for pan-cancer biopsies are thus urgently needed. We developed a deep learning-based classifier, named GeneCT<ORGANIZATION>, for predicting cancerous status and tissue origin of pan-cancer biopsies. GeneCT<ORGANIZATION> showed high performance on pan-cancer datasets from various sources and outperformed existing tools. We believe that GeneCT<ORGANIZATION> can potentially facilitate cancer diagnosis, tumor origin determination and molecular cancer studies. GeneCT<ORGANIZATION> is implemented in Perl/R on GNU/Linux platforms.
