 The aim of this study was to investigate if hand grip strength ( HGS<ORGANIZATION> ) is associated with: 1 ) fatigue, and specifically clinically relevant fatigue ( CRF<ORGANIZATION> ) ; 2 ) low physical activity ; and 3 ) fatigue independent of physical activity level, among individuals with and without COPD<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> were collected from the Obstructive Lung Disease<ORGANIZATION> in Northern Sweden<GPE> ( OLIN<ORGANIZATION> ) COPD-study in 2014. HGS<ORGANIZATION> was measured with a hand-grip dynamometer, fatigue and physical activity were assessed by questionnaires ; FACIT-Fatigue respectively IPAQ<ORGANIZATION>. Among individuals with COPD<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 389 ), but not without COPD<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 442 ), HGS<ORGANIZATION> was lower among those with CRF<ORGANIZATION> than those without CRF<ORGANIZATION>, significantly so among men ( p = 0.001 ) and close to among women ( p = 0.051 ). HGS<ORGANIZATION> was not associated with physical activity levels within any of the groups. HGS<ORGANIZATION> was associated with fatigue among men, but not women, with COPD<ORGANIZATION> independent of physical activity level, age, height, and smoking habits ( Beta<ORGANIZATION> = 0.190, 95 % CI 0.061-0.319, respectively Beta<PERSON> = 0.048, 95 % CI-0.056-0.152 ), while there were no corresponding significant findings among individuals without COPD<ORGANIZATION>. In summary, HGS<ORGANIZATION> was associated with CRF<ORGANIZATION> among individuals with COPD<ORGANIZATION> in this population-based study. Among men with COPD<ORGANIZATION>, HGS<ORGANIZATION> was associated with fatigue independent of physical activity level and common confounders.
