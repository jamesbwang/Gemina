 A dural arteriovenous fistula ( DAVF<ORGANIZATION> ) presenting with acute subdural haematoma ( ASDH<ORGANIZATION> ), which were not related to head injury, is rare. A 61-year-old woman was transported by ambulance because of deterioration of consciousness. On admission, she was comatose with anisocoria. Emergent CT<PERSON> demonstrated a severe midline shift associated with a left ASDH<ORGANIZATION> and an additional left occipital intracerebral haematoma, both of which had no continuity with each other. MRI<ORGANIZATION> showed flow void signs in the left occipital lobe. Because of the impending cerebral herniation, an emergent evacuation of the ASDH<ORGANIZATION> and external decompression was performed. Subsequent evaluation revealed a DAVF<ORGANIZATION> at the left occipital convexity near the confluence with retrograde leptomeningeal venous reflux and venous ectasia ( Cognard<ORGANIZATION> type III<ORGANIZATION> DAVF ). The patient underwent endovascular treatment for the DAVF<ORGANIZATION> involving transarterial embolisation using coils and
