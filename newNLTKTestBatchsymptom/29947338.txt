 C5a receptor antagonist PMX205<ORGANIZATION> is a synthetic hexapeptide capable of blocking C5a-C5a receptor ( C5aR<ORGANIZATION> ) axis by simulating C5a<ORGANIZATION> active C-terminal amino acid residues. This hexapeptide presents good anti-inflammatory effects in a series of inflammation models. The anti-inflammatory effect of PMX205<ORGANIZATION> on periodontitis is yet to be fully fathomed. To examine the anti-inflammatory effects of PMX205<ORGANIZATION> on RAW264.7 mouse macrophages exposed to gingipain extracts and Porphyromonas<GPE> gingivalis ( P. gingivalis ). MTT<ORGANIZATION> assay was carried out so as to specify the cytotoxicity of PMX205<ORGANIZATION>. RAW264.7 cells were co-cultured in vitro with gingipain extracts or P. gingivalis to simulate the periodontitis inflammatory milieu. Real-time quantitative PCR<ORGANIZATION>, ELISA<ORGANIZATION> and Griess<ORGANIZATION> assay were performed in order to detect tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ), IL-6, IL-23, nitric oxide ( NO<ORGANIZATION> ), IL-10, transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1 ), andarginase-1 ( Arg-1 ). Furthermore, phagocytosis assay was done to evaluate the phagocytic capacity of RAW<ORGANIZATION> 264.7 cells. Finally, western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( MyD88<ORGANIZATION> ). PMX205<ORGANIZATION> increased the expression levels of bacteriostatic substances ( NO<ORGANIZATION> and IL-23 ) and anti-inflammatory cytokines ( TGF-β1, IL-10 and Arg-1 ) ; however, it reduced the expression levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 once RAW<ORGANIZATION> 264.7 macrophages were stimulated via gingipain extracts or P. gingivalis. In addition, PMX205<ORGANIZATION> promoted the macrophage phagocytosis and down-regulated protein expression of MyD88<ORGANIZATION>. PMX205<ORGANIZATION> has recognizable anti-inflammatory effects in RAW<ORGANIZATION> 264.7 cell inflammation model, a finding which probably opens doors to future investigations on new targets for the prevention and treatment of chronic periodontitis.
