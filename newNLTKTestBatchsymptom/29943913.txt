 To describe the characteristics of pediatric cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( EGPA<ORGANIZATION> ), a systemic necrotizing vasculitis rarely diagnosed in children, retrieved from the French<GPE> Reference Center for rare pediatric lung diseases and compared with adult cases included in the French<GPE> Vasculitis Study Group<ORGANIZATION> cohort. We collected information on pediatric EGPA<ORGANIZATION> disease presentation, management, and outcome. Cases met the Lanham<GPE> criteria and/or American College<ORGANIZATION> of Rheumatology<GPE> classification criteria. Fourteen cases of pediatric EGPA<ORGANIZATION> were included, from 1980 to 2012, with a median follow-up of 58.5 months. Median<GPE> age at diagnosis was 12.3 years. All cases had respiratory involvement. The organ systems most frequently involved were the upper airway ( 85 % ), skin ( 71 % ), digestive tract ( 64 % ), and heart ( 57 % ). Neurological and renal involvement were rare. Four of the fourteen children were positive for ANCA<ORGANIZATION> ( 30.7 % ). During follow-up, three children required intensive care and one child died. The relapse rate was 64 %. In comparison with an adult cohort, we found more ENT<ORGANIZATION>, heart, and digestive-tract involvement, and fewer neurological manifestations. In children, the delay between asthma onset and diagnosis was shorter, and biopsies showed fewer features of vasculitis. This French<GPE> cohort is the biggest pediatric EGPA<ORGANIZATION> series described to date, with a long follow-up period. The findings confirm that pediatric EGPA<ORGANIZATION> has specific clinical, radiological, and histological characteristics that differ from adult EGPA<ORGANIZATION>. Development of systemic symptoms, and consequently diagnosis, occur with a shorter delay in children, mainly during the eosinophilic phase and leading to a specific presentation.
