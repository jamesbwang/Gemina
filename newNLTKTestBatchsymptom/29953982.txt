 Acute<GPE> spontaneous bullous urticaria is an extremely rare entity, and there are few reports with blister formation in acute urticaria patients. We present a two-year old girl who was admitted for bullous spontaneous acute urticaria ; the underlying reason for this was not detected. Nikolsky<PERSON> 's sign and Darrier<PERSON> 's sign were negative. Lesions were not compatible with erythema multiforme. However, biopsy was not allowed to be performed. Because of this, the underlying pathogenesis could not be clarified. She was recovered by a short course of antihistamine and systemic steroid, and the lesions did not recur during two-year follow-up. Short term systemic steroid in addition to oral antihistamines resulted in prompt recovery in a patient with acute urticaria complicated by bullae.
