 IgG4-related disease ( IgG4-RD ) and Castleman<PERSON> 's disease ( CD ) share similar clinical manifestations. When the histopathology coincides with the diagnosis of both IgG4-RD and CD<ORGANIZATION>, it is hard to depart the two disease entities utterly ; here we call it IgG4-CD provisionally. In this study, we aim to review the clinical features of IgG4-CD. This study is based on a retrospective analysis of a prospectively acquired database. IgG4-CD was defined histopathologically in patients who fulfilled the diagnosis of both IgG4-RD and CD. Forty-five definite IgG4-RD and 16 multicentric CD ( MCD<ORGANIZATION> ) patients were recruited as controls. Clinical<PERSON> features including organ involvement, serum IgG4<ORGANIZATION>, IgG<ORGANIZATION>, IgE<ORGANIZATION>, ESR<ORGANIZATION>, CRP<ORGANIZATION>, and IL-6 levels were collected and analyzed. Fifteen patients ( 2.8 % ) out of 534 patients with IgG4-RD in China<GPE> 's largest prospective IgG4-RD and Mimicry<GPE> cohort fulfilled the definition of IgG4-CD. There were 14 males and 1 female, whose mean age was 47 Â± 18 years old, and the median disease duration before diagnosis was 12 ( 1-132 ) months. Eight patients have allergic disease history. IgG4-CD patients had more lymph node involvement ( 100 vs 57.8 %, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ), while IgG4-RD patients had more submandibular ( 33.3 vs 77.1 %, P<PERSON> < 0.01 ) and parotid gland ( 13.3 vs 40.9 %, P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) affected. IgG4-CD patients had significantly higher levels of ESR<ORGANIZATION>, CRP<ORGANIZATION>, IgG<ORGANIZATION>, IgG1<ORGANIZATION>, IgG3<ORGANIZATION>, IgG4<ORGANIZATION>, and IgE<ORGANIZATION> than IgG4-RD patients. Compared with MCD<ORGANIZATION> patients, IgG4-CD patients showed higher incidence of salivary gland and paranasal sinus involvement, higher hemoglobin, eosinophil count, serum IgG4<ORGANIZATION> level and IgG4/IgG ratio, and lower CRP<ORGANIZATION>, IL-6 levels, and IgG1/IgG, IgG2/IgG ratio. All patients with IgG4-CD exhibited relatively favorable outcomes. Both IgG4-RD and CD can involve multiple organs. There are a small group of patients who had clinical and pathological characteristics of both CD and IgG4-RD showed better clinical outcome. In the long-term prognosis of these patients, the relationship of CD<ORGANIZATION> and IgG4-RD is waiting to be further elucidated.
