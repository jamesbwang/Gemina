 The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire<ORGANIZATION> ( DCQ<ORGANIZATION> ) is a widely used screening instrument assessing dysmorphic concerns ranging from a mild to an excessive level. It is often used in the setting of plastic and aesthetic surgery. The present study aimed at examining the psychometric properties of the DCQ<ORGANIZATION> in a random general population sample. A representative sample of the German<GPE> general population ( N = 2053, aged between 18 and 65 years, 54 % females ) completed the DCQ<ORGANIZATION> as well as questionnaires on depression and appearance concerns. The DCQ<ORGANIZATION> showed a good internal consistency with Cronbach<PERSON> 's α = 0.81. Its one-factor model structure was confirmed. Normative data were stratified according to gender and age. Women<PERSON> reported more dysmorphic concerns than men, but also within females the DCQ<ORGANIZATION> scores differed between age classes. Overall, 4.0 % of the sample reported excessive dysmorphic concerns based on a previously defined cutoff sum score ≥ 11. The DCQ<ORGANIZATION> is a valid and reliable screening tool to identify individuals with excessive dysmorphic concerns. Excessive concerns may indicate also the presence of body dysmorphic disorder, but for verifying a final diagnosis the use of a structured clinical interview is necessary.
