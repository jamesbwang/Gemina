 MicroRNA-210 ( miR-210 ) is a robust target for hypoxia-inducible factor, and its overexpression has been detected in a variety of solid tumors. However, the role of miR-210 in the development, progression and response to therapy in cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA<ORGANIZATION> ) remains undefined. We report here that high miR-210 expression was significantly correlated with the shorter survival of CCA<ORGANIZATION> patients. Overexpression of miR-210 inhibited CCA<ORGANIZATION> cell proliferation at the G2/M phase and reduced the gemcitabine sensitivity in CCA<ORGANIZATION> cells under CoCl2-induced pseudohypoxia. Concomitantly, inhibition of endogenous miR-210 activity using miRNA<ORGANIZATION> sponges increased cell proliferation under CoCl2-induced pseudohypoxia, resulting in an increase in gemcitabine sensitivity in CCA<ORGANIZATION> cells. We showed that HIF-3α, a negative controller of HIF-1α, was a target of miR-210 constituting a feed-forward hypoxic regulatory loop. Our data suggest an important role of miR-210 in sustaining HIF-1α activity via the suppression of HIF-3α, regulating cell growth and chemotherapeutic drug resistance in CCA<ORGANIZATION>.
