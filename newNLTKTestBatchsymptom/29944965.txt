 White<GPE> matter ( WM ) is injured in most strokes, which contributes to functional deficits during recovery. Casein<PERSON> kinase 2 ( CK2<ORGANIZATION> ) is a protein kinase that is expressed in brain, including WM<ORGANIZATION>. To assess the impact of CK2<ORGANIZATION> inhibition on axon recovery following oxygen glucose deprivation ( OGD<ORGANIZATION> ), mouse optic nerves ( MONs<ORGANIZATION> ), which are pure WM tracts, were subjected to OGD<ORGANIZATION> with or without the selective CK2<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor CX-4945. CX-4945 application preserved axon function during OGD<ORGANIZATION> and promoted axon function recovery when applied before or after OGD<ORGANIZATION>. This protective effect of CK2<ORGANIZATION> inhibition correlated with preservation of oligodendrocytes and conservation of axon structure and axonal mitochondria. To investigate the pertinent downstream signaling pathways, siRNA<ORGANIZATION> targeting the CK2Î±<ORGANIZATION> subunit identified CDK5<ORGANIZATION> and AKT<ORGANIZATION> as downstream molecules. Consequently, MK-2206 and roscovitine, which are selective AKT<ORGANIZATION> and CDK5<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors, respectively, protected young and aging WM function only when applied before OGD<ORGANIZATION>. However, a novel pan-AKT allosteric inhibitor, ARQ-092, which targets both the inactive and active conformations of AKT<ORGANIZATION>, conferred protection to young and aging axons when applied before or after OGD<ORGANIZATION>. These results suggest that AKT<ORGANIZATION> and CDK5<ORGANIZATION> signaling contribute to the WM<ORGANIZATION> functional protection conferred by CK2<ORGANIZATION> inhibition during ischemia, while inhibition of activated AKT<ORGANIZATION> signaling plays the primary role in post-ischemic protection conferred by CK2<ORGANIZATION> inhibition in WM independent of age. CK2<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors are currently being used in clinical trials for cancer patients ; therefore, our results will provide rationale for repurposing these drugs as therapeutic options for stroke patients by adding novel targets.
