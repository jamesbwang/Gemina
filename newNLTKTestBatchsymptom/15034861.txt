 [ Purpose<PERSON> ] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of trunk stabilization exercise on the transvers abdominalis ( TA ) and internal oblique ( IO ) muscle activity and balance ability of normal subjects. [ Subjects and Methods<ORGANIZATION> ] Forty healthy male subjects without orthopedic history of the lower extremity were selected for the present study. The experimental group received a hollowing exercise, curl-up and bridging exercise. The control group received a pelvic tilting exercise in the sitting position for the same period of time. [ Results ] Significant differences in the post-training gains in Balance<GPE> index, TA<ORGANIZATION>, IO<ORGANIZATION> were observed between the experimental group and the control group. [ Conclusion<ORGANIZATION> ] The trunk stabilization exercise improved the balance ability and increased the activity of the TA<ORGANIZATION> and IO<ORGANIZATION> muscle.
