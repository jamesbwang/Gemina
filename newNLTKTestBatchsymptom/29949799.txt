 < br > Objective: Autosomal dominant familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( adFNDI<ORGANIZATION> ) is characterized by severe polyuria and polydipsia and is caused by variations in the gene encoding the AVP<ORGANIZATION> prohormone. The study aimed to ascertain a correct diagnosis, to identify the underlying genetic cause of adFNDI<ORGANIZATION> in a Swedish<GPE> kindred, and to test the hypothesis that the identified synonymous exonic variant in the AVP<ORGANIZATION> gene ( c.324G > A ), causes missplicing, and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) retention of the prohormone. Three affected family members were admitted for fluid deprivation test and dDAVP<ORGANIZATION> challenge test. Direct sequencing of the AVP<ORGANIZATION> gene was performed in affected subjects, and genotyping of the identified variant was performed in family members. The variant was examined by expression of AVP<ORGANIZATION> minigenes containing the entire coding regions as well as intron 2 of AVP<ORGANIZATION>. Clinical<PERSON> tests revealed significant phenotypical variation with both complete and partial adFNDI<ORGANIZATION> phenotype. DNA analysis revealed a synonymous c.324G > A substitution in one allele of the AVP<ORGANIZATION> gene in affected family members only. Cellular studies revealed both normally spliced and misspliced pre-mRNA in cells transfected with the AVP<ORGANIZATION> c.324G > A minigene. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed collective localization of the variant prohormone to ER<ORGANIZATION> and vesicular structures at the tip of cellular processes. We have identified a synonymous variant affecting the second nucleotide of exon 3 in the AVP<ORGANIZATION> gene ( c.324G > A ) in a kindred in which adFNDI<ORGANIZATION> segregates. Notably, we showed that this variant causes partial missplicing of pre-mRNA resulting in accumulation of variant prohormone in ER. Our study suggests that even a small amount of aberrant mRNA<ORGANIZATION> might be sufficient to disturb cellular function resulting in adFNDI<GPE>. < br >.
