 The aim of the study was to assess the patterns of development of metachronous cancer ( endometrial cancer, EC<ORGANIZATION>, and ovarian cancer, OC ) in breast cancer ( BC ) patients dependent of receptor phenotype of breast tumors. In the study, 63 patients with ะะก<ORGANIZATION>, who developed metachronous EC ( n = 47 ) or OC ( n = 16 ) were enrolled. Expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ), progesterone receptor ( PR ), HER/2neu was assessed using immunohistochemical approach. BC in patients with metachronous EC and OC<ORGANIZATION> was characterized by a different frequency of molecular subtypes with the dominance of luminal A ( 36 % ) and B ( 43 % ) subtypes. In primary BC, we have established a correlation between ER expression and regional lymph nodes status ( r = -0.50, p & lt ; 0.05 ) ; negative correlation between HER2/neu expression and tumor stage ( r = -0.48, p & lt ; 0.05 ) ; between the molecular subtype of BC<ORGANIZATION> and its size ( r = -0.33, p & lt ; 0.05 ), the molecular subtype of primary BC and metastases in regional lymph nodes ( r = 0.27, p & lt ; 0.05 ). In the patients with luminal subtype BC metachronous tumors developed with the highest frequency ( OC<ORGANIZATION> - 50 %, EC<ORGANIZATION> - 50 % ). After treatment of primary BC metachronous tumors developed at different period: EC ( 22.2 % ) - most often in 3-5 years, OC<GPE> ( 11.0 % ) - after 10 years and more. Our data evidence on the clinical significance of the individual characteristics of the BC<ORGANIZATION>, especially its molecular subtype, and the need to calculate the personalized risk of development of metachronous tumors of the reproductive system in patients with the BC<ORGANIZATION>.
