 Some clinical studies have found alterations in the levels of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF<ORGANIZATION> ) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF<ORGANIZATION> ) after applying antidepressant treatment in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD<ORGANIZATION> ). We evaluated the serum BDNF<ORGANIZATION> and GDNF<ORGANIZATION> levels before and after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment in MDD<ORGANIZATION> outpatients. Serum BDNF<PERSON> and GDNF<ORGANIZATION> levels were measured in 23 female MDD<ORGANIZATION> outpatients at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. The severity of depression was measured with the Hamilton Depression<ORGANIZATION> Rating Scale-17 ( HAMD-17 ). Remission of MDD<ORGANIZATION> to the treatment was defined as a posttreatment HAMD-17 score of < 7. Among MDD<ORGANIZATION> patients, 19 ( 82.6 % ) subjects were in mild to moderate depression. The whole MDD<ORGANIZATION> patients had significantly higher serum BDNF<ORGANIZATION> and GDNF<ORGANIZATION> levels at baseline than those after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. The baseline serum BDNF<ORGANIZATION> and GDNF<ORGANIZATION> levels did not significantly between the remission and nonremission groups. The significant alteration in both BDNF<ORGANIZATION> and GDNF<ORGANIZATION> levels after antidepressant treatment were observed in patients with remission. The present study suggests that the baseline serum BDNF<ORGANIZATION> and GDNF<ORGANIZATION> levels are higher than the posttreatment levels in some mild-to-moderate MDD<ORGANIZATION> outpatients and the significant alteration in BDNF<ORGANIZATION> and GDNF<ORGANIZATION> level after treatment were observed in patients with remission.
