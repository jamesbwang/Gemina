 Muscle<GPE> shortening and spastic cocontraction in ankle plantar flexors may alter gait since early childhood in cerebral palsy ( CP ). We evaluated gastrosoleus complex ( GSC<ORGANIZATION> ) length, and gastrocnemius medialis ( GM ) and peroneus longus ( PL ) activity during swing phase, in very young hemiparetic children with equinovalgus. This was an observational, retrospective, and monocentric outpatient study in a pediatric hospital. Ten very young hemiparetic children ( age 3 Â± 1 yrs ) were enrolled. These CP children were assessed for muscle extensibility ( Tardieu<ORGANIZATION> scale On the paretic side: ( i ) the mean In very young hemiparetic children, the paretic GSC<ORGANIZATION> may rapidly shorten in the first years of life. GM and PL<ORGANIZATION> cocontraction during swing phase are excessive, which contributes to dynamic equinovalgus. Muscle<PERSON> extensibility (
