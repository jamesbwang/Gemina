 Aerobic<GPE> exercise reduces blood pressure ( BP ), but it is unknown whether a high-intensity training approach can elicit a greater BP reduction in populations with elevated BP. This systematic review compared the efficacy of high-intensity interval training ( HIIT<ORGANIZATION> ) versus moderate-intensity continuous training ( MICT<ORGANIZATION> ) for reducing BP in adults with pre- to established hypertension. Five electronic databases ( MEDLINE<ORGANIZATION>, EMBASE<ORGANIZATION>, CENTRAL<ORGANIZATION>, PEDro<ORGANIZATION>, and SPORTDiscus<ORGANIZATION> ) were searched for randomized trials comparing the chronic effects of HIIT<ORGANIZATION> versus MICT on BP in individuals with resting systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 85 mmHg and/or under antihypertensive medication. Random-effects modelling was used to compare changes from pre- to post-intervention in resting and ambulatory BP between HIIT<ORGANIZATION> and MICT<ORGANIZATION>. Changes from pre- to post-intervention in maximal oxygen uptake ( [ Formula: see text ] O Ambulatory BP was excluded from the meta-analysis due to the limited number of studies ( two studies ). Comparing changes from pre- to post-intervention, no differences in resting systolic BP ( MD<ORGANIZATION> - 0.22 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> [ CI 95 %, - 5.36 to 4.92 ], p = 0.93, I HIIT and MICT<ORGANIZATION> provided comparable reductions in resting BP in adults with pre- to established hypertension. HIIT<ORGANIZATION> was associated with greater improvements in [ Formula: see text ] O PROSPERO registration ( 2016: CRD42016041885 ).
