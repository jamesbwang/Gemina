 Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome ( BVVLS<ORGANIZATION> ) or riboflavin transporter deficiency ( OMIM<ORGANIZATION> 211530 ) is a rare treatable autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. This condition is associated with progressive pontobulbar palsy. We describe the clinical course of a 16-month-old boy with BVVLS<ORGANIZATION> and a novel homozygous mutation from Pakistan<GPE>. Our patient presented with stridor and respiratory insufficiency. Hearing loss which is the most common sign of this condition was absent, making it an unusual presentation of BVVLS<ORGANIZATION>. His examination revealed ptosis and tongue fasciculation. His riboflavin receptor mutational analysis showed the homozygous mutation in the
