 Waist<GPE> circumference ( WC ) has been incorporated in the definition of the metabolic syndrome ( MetS<ORGANIZATION> ) but the exact WC cut-off points across populations are not clear. The Joint Interim<ORGANIZATION> Statement ( JIS<ORGANIZATION> ) suggested possible cut-offs to different populations and ethnic groups. However, the adequacy of these cut-offs to Brazilian<GPE> adults has been scarcely investigated. The objective of the study is to evaluate possible WC thresholds to be used in the definition of MetS<ORGANIZATION> using data from the Longitudinal Study<ORGANIZATION> of Adult Health<PERSON> ( ELSA-Brasil ), a multicenter cohort study of civil servants ( 35-74 years old ) of six Brazilian<GPE> cities. We analyzed baseline data from 14,893 participants ( 6772 men and 8121 women ). A MetS<ORGANIZATION> was defined according to the JIS<ORGANIZATION> criteria, but excluding WC<ORGANIZATION> and thus requiring 2 of the 4 remaining elements. We used restricted cubic spline regression to graph the relationship between WC<ORGANIZATION> and MetS<ORGANIZATION>. We identified optimal cut-off points which maximized joint sensitivity and specificity ( Youden<PERSON> 's index ) from Receiver<ORGANIZATION> Operator Characteristic Curves. We also estimated the C-statistics using logistic regression. We found no apparent threshold for WC in restricted cubic spline plots. Optimal cut-off for men was 92 cm ( 2 cm lower than that recommended by JIS<ORGANIZATION> for Caucasian/Europids or Sub-Saharan African<GPE> men ), but 2 cm higher than that recommended for ethnic Central<ORGANIZATION> and South American<GPE>. For women, optimal cut-off was 86, 6 cm higher than that recommended for Caucasian/Europids and ethnic Central<ORGANIZATION> and South American<GPE>. Optimal cut-offs did not very across age groups and most common race/color categories ( except for Asian<GPE> men, 87 cm ). Sex-specific cut-offs for WC<ORGANIZATION> recommended by JIS<ORGANIZATION> differ from optimal cut-offs we found for adult men and women of BrazilÂ´s most common ethnic groups.
