 cardiovascular diseases ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most common cause of death in Indonesia<GPE>. We aimed to examine risks of CVD<ORGANIZATION> in workers aged 40 to 69 year related to their occupational status. a cross-sectional study in all provinces of Indonesia<GPE>. Data from a large-scale national health survey called RISKESDAS<ORGANIZATION> were used to analyze factors associated with CVD<ORGANIZATION>. Analysis<PERSON> was restricted to the working population aged 40 to 69 year. There were 137,378 subjects included in the analysis. Cox<PERSON> 's regression analysis was modified to calculate prevalence ratio for the association of CVD<ORGANIZATION> with diabetes mellitus ( DM ), hypertension, stress, body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ), smoking, and particular demographic factors. CVD<ORGANIZATION> was associated with occupation ; white collar workers were about 1.6 times as likely to be diagnosed with CVD<ORGANIZATION> as to blue collar workers. However, blue collar workers were more likely to report symptoms of CVD<ORGANIZATION> than white collar workers. Prevalence of CVD<ORGANIZATION> was higher in women than men, increasing by age and education attainment. Hypertension, DM<ORGANIZATION>, stress, and increased BMI<ORGANIZATION> added the prediction of CVD<ORGANIZATION>: prevalence ratio ( PR ) was 1.72 ( 95 % CI 1.59-1.86 ), 3.89 ( 95 % CI 3.43-4.44 ), 3.02 ( 95 % CI 2.77-3.29 ) and 1.42 ( 95 % CI 1.28-1.57 ) for BMI<ORGANIZATION> â‰¥27 relative to < 25 kg/m2, respectively. The study could not explain the association with smoking. this study added evidence of major risk factors which could be modified to reduce CVD<ORGANIZATION>. Some associations were likely to reflect access to health care.
