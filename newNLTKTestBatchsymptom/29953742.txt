 To explore associations of joint hypermobility ( a condition where range of motion is greater than normal ) with ankle and foot radiographic osteoarthritis and symptoms in a large community-based cohort of African American<ORGANIZATION> and Caucasian<GPE> adults 55-94 years old. Ankle<PERSON> and foot radiographs and joint hypermobility data ( Beighton Criteria<PERSON> ) were available for 848 participants ( 2003-2010 ) in this cross-sectional study. General joint hypermobility was defined as a Beighton<GPE> score â‰¥4 ( range 0-9 ) ; knee hypermobility was defined as hyperextension of at least one knee. Standing anteroposterior and lateral foot radiographs were read with standard atlases for Kellgren-Lawrence grade, osteophytes and joint space narrowing at the tibiotalar joint and for osteophytes and joint space narrowing to define osteoarthritis at five foot joints. Ankle<PERSON> or foot symptoms were self-reported. Separate person-based logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of ankle and foot osteoarthritis and symptom outcomes with hypermobility measures, adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, and history of ankle/foot injury. This sample was: 68 % women and 33 % African<ORGANIZATION> American<GPE> ; mean age=71 years ; mean body mass index=31 kg/m Knee<PERSON> joint hypermobility may be related to talonavicular osteoarthritis and to ankle and foot symptoms.
