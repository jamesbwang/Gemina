 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ), the most common cause of liver disease, affects approximately 75 to 100 million Americans. Patients with concurrent NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> and type 2 diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of progressing to advanced fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis compared to non-diabetics. Lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, remain the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD<ORGANIZATION>, as there are no medications currently indicated for this disease state. Anti-diabetic pharmacologic therapies aimed at improving insulin sensitivity and decreasing insulin production have been studied to determine their potential role in slowing the progression of NAFLD<ORGANIZATION>. In this review, we focus on the evidence surrounding anti-diabetic medications and their ability to improve disease progression in patients with NAFLD<ORGANIZATION>.
