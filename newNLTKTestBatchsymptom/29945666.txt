 ( 3R ) -Falcarinol ( FaOH<ORGANIZATION> ) and ( 3R,8S ) -falcarindiol ( FaDOH<ORGANIZATION> ) have previously been shown to reduce the number of neoplastic lesions and the growth rate of polyps in the colon of azoxymethane ( AOM<ORGANIZATION> ) treated rats. Based on previous investigations, it appears that different mechanisms of actions are involved in the antineoplastic effect of FaOH<ORGANIZATION> and FaDOH<ORGANIZATION>. One mechanism of action may be related to the antibacterial effect of FaOH<ORGANIZATION> and FaDOH<ORGANIZATION> and thus their effect on the gut microbiota. This study aimed to determine the effect of FaOH<ORGANIZATION> and FaDOH<ORGANIZATION> on gut microbiota composition of AOM<ORGANIZATION> treated rats. Azoxymethane<PERSON> treated rats were fed either a standard rat diet or a rat diet supplemented with FaOH<ORGANIZATION> and FaDOH<ORGANIZATION>. The gut microbiota of AOM-induced rats was determined by 16S rRNA gene-amplicon sequencing. Analysis of fecal cecum samples demonstrated a significant gut microbiota change in rats receiving standard rat diet supplemented with FaOH<ORGANIZATION> and FaDOH<ORGANIZATION> compared with the control group that only received the rat diet. Comparison<ORGANIZATION> of the gut microbiota of rats who developed large neoplasms in the colon with rats without large neoplasms showed that the gut microbiota was significantly different in rats who developed large colon neoplasms compared to rats with no macroscopic colon neoplasms.
