 To explore the sensitivity of potential DTI-based biomarkers in detecting microstructural changes for whole-brain white matter in early stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS<ORGANIZATION> ), analyze the relationship between the DTI<ORGANIZATION> indices and disease status, and further clarify potential brain regions for disease monitoring and clinical assessment. Thirty-three non-demented ALS<ORGANIZATION> patients and 32 age- and gender-matched subjects participated in this study. DTI<ORGANIZATION> data were acquired via 3.0T MRI scanner. Maps of diffusion-related indices including fractional anisotropy ( FA<ORGANIZATION> ), mean diffusivity ( MD ), axial diffusivity ( AD ), and radial diffusivity ( RD ) were obtained. Tract-based spatial statistics ( TBSS<ORGANIZATION> ) were used to investigate whole-brain white matter changes of each index. Correlation analyses between both brain-wide and volume-of-interest ( VOI<ORGANIZATION> ) -wide white matter alterations and clinical factors including ALSFRS-R scores, disease duration, and progression rate were performed. Compared to healthy subjects, ALS<ORGANIZATION> patients showed significantly increased RD<ORGANIZATION>, MD<ORGANIZATION> and reduced FA<ORGANIZATION>, mainly along the corticospinal tract ( CST<ORGANIZATION> ) and the body of corpus callosum ( CC ). Increases in RD were broader than decreases in FA<GPE>, in CST<ORGANIZATION> of both hemispheres. Meanwhile, involvement of several extra-motor regions was also revealed by RD<ORGANIZATION>. Significant positive correlation between ALSFRS-R scores and FA<ORGANIZATION>, negative correlation between ALSFRS-R and RD were found in left CST<ORGANIZATION>. RD may be the most sensitive biomarker for the detection of early demyelination of white matter. Both RD and FA<ORGANIZATION> may serve as objective biomarkers for disease severity assessment. CST may be the most affected brain region in non-demented ALS. • Changes in RD were broader than those in FA in bilateral CST<ORGANIZATION>. • Involvement of extra-motor regions was uncovered by RD<ORGANIZATION>. • FA<ORGANIZATION> and RD in CST<ORGANIZATION> were related to ALSFRS-R scores.
