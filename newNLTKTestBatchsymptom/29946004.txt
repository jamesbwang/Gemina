 Anaerobic<GPE> and aerobic bacteria were quantitated in respiratory samples across three cystic fibrosis ( CF ) centres using extended culture methods. Subjects, ages 1-69 years, who were clinically stable provided sputum ( n=200 ) or bronchoalveolar lavage ( n=55 ). Eighteen anaerobic and 39 aerobic genera were cultured from 59 % and 95 % of samples, respectively ; 16/57 genera had a â‰¥5 % prevalence across centres. Analyses of microbial communities using co-occurrence networks in sputum samples showed groupings of oral, including anaerobic, bacteria whereas typical CF pathogens formed distinct entities.
