 Chiral<GPE> lanthanide helical architectures have received intense attentions in recent years because of their potential applications as chiral probes and sensors and as circularly polarized luminescence ( CPL<ORGANIZATION> ) materials. However, stereoselectivity control in the self-assembly of lanthanide helicate is challenging due to the poor stereochemical preference and variable coordination numbers of Ln<GPE> ( III<ORGANIZATION> ) ions. Herein<PERSON>, we reported the employing chiral ancillary ligand R/S-BINAPO to induce achiral tripodal ligand to form a pair of homochiral lanthanide triple-helical podates [ Eu<GPE> ( TTEA<ORGANIZATION> ) ( ( R/S ) -BINAPO ) ; R/S-1 ] { ( R/S ) -BINAPO = ( R/ S ) -2,2'-bis ( diphenylphosphoryl ) -1,1'-binaphthyl ; TTEA<ORGANIZATION> = tris [ ( 4- ( 4,4,4-trifluoro-1,3-dioxobutyl ) -benzamido ) ethyl ] amine }. X-ray crystallographic analysis for rac-1 reveals that the chirality of BINAPO<ORGANIZATION> is transferred during the self-assembly process to give either P or M helical architectures in podates. The
