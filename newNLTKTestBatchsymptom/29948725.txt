 Spinal<GPE> cord injury ( SCI<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the most common and serious condition, which leads to permanent neurological dysfunction and poor prognosis in patients. Hyperglycemia<PERSON> impairs neural functional recovery after SCI<ORGANIZATION> resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ) and inflammatory cytokines. However, the effect of glucose metabolism in the spinal cord after injury remains unclear. AKR1B1<ORGANIZATION>, one member of the aldo/keto reductase superfamily, is involved in the energy metabolism of plasm glucose and ROS<ORGANIZATION> production. The role of AKR1B1<ORGANIZATION> in cancer cell proliferation and invasion has been confirmed. Meanwhile, Akt<PERSON>, one pivotal transcription factor particularly, is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and ROS-mediated secondary injury in the lesion site. In our study, we established an acute SCI<ORGANIZATION> rat model to identify the expression of AKR1B1<ORGANIZATION> and its role in neural recovery processes. Western blotting revealed the expression of AKR1B1<ORGANIZATION> protein was elevated after injury, peaked at 3 days and declined gradually to normal at 14 days. Similar results was illustrated in immunohistochemistry staining of white matter. Double<PERSON> immunofluorescence staining showed AKR1B1<ORGANIZATION> was expressed in glial cells and its expression was significantly increased in proliferative astrocytes during the pathological processes. Further experiments showed AKR1B1<ORGANIZATION> was co-located with Akt<PERSON> protein in GFAP<ORGANIZATION> positive cells and immunoprecipitated with Akt<PERSON> in injured spinal cord as well. In summary, the present study demonstrated AKR1B1<ORGANIZATION> played a vital role in astrocytes proliferation through Akt<GPE> pathway, associated with the metabolism of hyperglycemia induced by SCI<ORGANIZATION>.
