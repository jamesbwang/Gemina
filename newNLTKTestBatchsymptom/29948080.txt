 The aim of this study was to apply texture analysis ( TA ) on paraspinal musculature in T2-weighted<GPE> ( T2w<ORGANIZATION> ) magnetic resonance images ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) of symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS<ORGANIZATION> ) patients and correlate the findings with clinical outcome measures. Ninety patients were prospectively enrolled in the multi-centric Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study<PERSON> ( LSOS<ORGANIZATION> ). All patients received a T2w<ORGANIZATION> MRI, from which we selected axial images perpendicular to the intervertebral disc at level L3/4 for TA<ORGANIZATION>. Regions-of-interest ( ROI<ORGANIZATION> ) were drawn of the paraspinal musculature and 304 TA features/ ROI<ORGANIZATION> were calculated. As clinical outcome measurements, we analysed three commonly applied measures: Spinal Stenosis Measure<PERSON> ( SSM<ORGANIZATION> ), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ<ORGANIZATION> ), as well as the Numeric<ORGANIZATION> Rating Scale ( NRS<ORGANIZATION> ). We used two machine learning-based classifiers: Decision table, and k-nearest neighbours ( k-NN ). We observed no meaningful correlation between TA in paraspinal musculature and the two clinical outcome measures SSM<ORGANIZATION> symptoms and SSM<ORGANIZATION> function, while a moderate correlation was observed regarding the outcome measures RMDQ<ORGANIZATION> ( k-NN: r = 0.56 ) and NRS<ORGANIZATION> ( Decision<ORGANIZATION> Table: r = 0.72 ). In conclusion, MR TA is a viable tool to quantify medical images and illustrate correlations of microarchitectural changes invisible to a human reader with potential clinical impact. • TA is feasible on paraspinal musculature using MRI<ORGANIZATION>. • TA on paraspinal musculature correlates with SSM<ORGANIZATION> and RMDQ<ORGANIZATION>. • TA may enable a statement regarding clinical impact of imaging findings.
