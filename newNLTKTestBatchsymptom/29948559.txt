 Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV<ORGANIZATION> ) -positive gastric cancers represent a distinct subtype of gastric cancers and account for nearly 10 % of the gastric cancer burden, yet risk detection strategies for this cancer subtype are lacking. We conducted a nested case-control study where we assayed 4 EBV antigens [ viral capsid antigen ( VCA<ORGANIZATION> ), early antigen ( EA ), Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen ( EBNA<ORGANIZATION> ), and BZLF1-encoded replication activator protein ( ZEBRA<ORGANIZATION> ) ] in either sera or plasma from 1447 gastric cancer cases and 1797 controls obtained from seven prospective cohorts representing individuals from the high gastric cancer-risk countries of China<GPE>, Japan<GPE>, and Korea<GPE>. The prevalence of EBV<ORGANIZATION> sero-positivity was universal with the exception of one sero-negative individual, and the highest titers of the EBV<ORGANIZATION> antigens VCA<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.78-1.17 ), EBNA<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.72-1.08 ), EA<GPE> ( OR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.79-1.19 ), and ZEBRA<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.71-1.07 ) were not associated with risk of incident gastric cancer. When we stratified these data by H. pylori status, there was no change in the association. Multiplex<PERSON> serology of the aforementioned EBV<ORGANIZATION> antigens in serum may not be a suitable biomarker for predicting gastric cancer risk in East<GPE> Asian<GPE> populations.
