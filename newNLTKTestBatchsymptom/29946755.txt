 Frailty<GPE> is a predictor of adverse outcomes in older subjects. The aims of this study are to ( 1 ) measure the frailty status and its changes occurring during the hospital stay, ( 2 ) determine the relationships among frailty and adverse outcomes. Frailty<PERSON> was assessed using a 46-item Frailty Index<PERSON> ( FI ) in 156 patients admitted to an Acute Geriatric Medicine Unit<PERSON>. The FI<ORGANIZATION> was calculated within 24 h from the hospital admission ( aFI<ORGANIZATION> ) and at his/her discharge ( dFI<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients were followed up to 12 months after the hospital discharge. A statistically significant difference was reported between the aFI<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.31, IQR<ORGANIZATION> 0.19-0.44 ) and the dFI<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.29, IQR<ORGANIZATION> 0.19-0.40 ; p = 0.04 ). The aFI<ORGANIZATION> was directly associated with the risk of in-hospital death ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 5.9 ; 95 % CI 2.0-17.5 ; p = 0.001 ), 1 year mortality ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 5.5, 95 % CI 2.4-12.7, p < 0.001 ) and re-hospitalization ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 6.3, 95 % CI 2.2-17.9, p = 0.03 ). Frailty<PERSON> is a strong predictor of negative endpoints in hospitalized older persons. Frailty<PERSON> assessment from routinely collected clinical data may provide important insights about the biological status of the individual and promote the personalization of care.
