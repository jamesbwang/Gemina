 Autosomal<GPE> recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay ( ARSACS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a neurodegenerative disease that is caused by mutations in the SACS<ORGANIZATION> gene. The product of this gene is a very large 520 kDa cytoplasmic protein, sacsin, with an ubiquitin-like domain ( Ubl ) at the N-terminus followed by three large sacsin internal repeats ( SIRPTs<ORGANIZATION> ) supradomains and C-terminal J and HEPN<ORGANIZATION> domains. The SIRPTs<ORGANIZATION> are predicted to contain Hsp90-like domains suggesting a potential chaperone activity. In this work, we report the structures of the Hsp90-like Sr1 domain of SIRPT1<ORGANIZATION> and the N-terminal Ubl domain determined at 1.55 Å and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively. The Ubl<ORGANIZATION> domain crystallized as a swapped dimer that could be relevant in the context of full-length protein. The Sr1<ORGANIZATION> domain displays the Bergerat<ORGANIZATION> protein fold with a characteristic nucleotide-binding pocket, though it binds nucleotides with very low affinity. The Sr1<ORGANIZATION> structure reveals that ARSACS-causing missense mutations ( R272H<PERSON>, R272C<PERSON> and T201K<GPE> ) disrupt protein folding most likely leading to sacsin degradation. This work lends a structural support to the view of sacsin as a molecular chaperone and provides a framework for future studies of this protein.
