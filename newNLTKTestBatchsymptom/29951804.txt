 Takotsubo<GPE> syndrome ( TS ) usually involves ECG<ORGANIZATION> changes mimicking acute myocardial infarction ( AMI<ORGANIZATION> ). The differentiation of both disorders is crucial for selection of appropriate treatment. The aim of this study was to assess ECG<ORGANIZATION> parameters in patients with TS<ORGANIZATION> and AMI<ORGANIZATION>, and try to establish a scoring tool for TS<ORGANIZATION> prediction. The study consisted of two study parts: evaluation and validation cohorts. Overall, the study included 82 patients with TS<ORGANIZATION> and 141 subjects with AMI<ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the major demographic characteristics and comorbidities, the following ECG<ORGANIZATION> parameters were analyzed: heart rate, QRS<ORGANIZATION> duration, QTc<ORGANIZATION>, QRS<ORGANIZATION> amplitudes in frontal and precordial leads, frequencies for ST-segment elevation, combined sign of positive ST-segment elevation in -aVR and absent in V<GPE> TS was frequently diagnosed in women and in elderly patients. Presence of ST-segment elevation, inverted/biphasic T-waves in V The developed ECG-based TS-score model may be a useful complimentary tool for TS<ORGANIZATION> prediction in acute clinical setting.
