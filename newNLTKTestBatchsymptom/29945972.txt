 Adaptations and responses to stress conditions are fundamental processes that all cells must accomplish to maintain or restore cellular homeostasis. Cells have a plethora of response pathways to mitigate the effect of different environmental stressors. The transcriptional regulators transcription factor EB ( TFEB<ORGANIZATION> ) and transcription factor binding to IGHM<ORGANIZATION> enhancer 3 ( TFE3<ORGANIZATION> ) play a key role in the control of these stress pathways. Therefore, understanding their regulation under different stress conditions is of great interest. Here, using a range of human and murine cells, we show that TFEB<ORGANIZATION> and TFE3<ORGANIZATION> are activated upon induction of acute oxidative stress by sodium arsenite via an mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1<ORGANIZATION> ) -independent process. We found that the mechanism of arsenite-stimulated TFEB<ORGANIZATION> and TFE3<ORGANIZATION> activation instead involves protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A<ORGANIZATION> ) -mediated dephosphorylation at Ser-211<ORGANIZATION> and Ser-321, respectively. Depletion of either the catalytic ( PPP2CA+B ) or regulatory ( PPP2R2A/B55Î± ) subunits of PP2A<ORGANIZATION>, as well as PP2A<ORGANIZATION> inactivation with the specific inhibitor okadaic acid, abolished TFEB<ORGANIZATION> and TFE3<ORGANIZATION> activation in response to sodium arsenite. Conversely, PP2A<ORGANIZATION> activation by ceramide or the sphingosine-like compound FTY720<ORGANIZATION> was sufficient to induce TFE3<ORGANIZATION> nuclear translocation. MS analysis revealed that PP2A<ORGANIZATION> dephosphorylates TFEB<ORGANIZATION> at several residues, including Ser-109, Ser-114, Ser-122<GPE>, and Ser-211, thus facilitating TFEB<ORGANIZATION> activation. Overall, this work identifies a critical mechanism that activates TFEB<ORGANIZATION> and TFE3<ORGANIZATION> without turning off mTORC1<ORGANIZATION> activity. We propose that this mechanism may enable some cell types such as immune or cancer cells that require simultaneous TFEB/TFE3 and mTORC1 signaling to survive and achieve robust cell growth in stressful environments.
