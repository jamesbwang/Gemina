 Chronic<GPE> kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a life-threatening disease arising as a frequent complication of diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Since it is typically undetected for long periods, it often progresses to end-stage renal disease. CKD<ORGANIZATION> is characterized by the development of progressive glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy along with a decreased glomerular filtration rate. This is associated with podocyte injury and a progressive rise in proteinuria. As endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) through the activation of endothelin receptor type A ( ET<ORGANIZATION> ( A ) ) promotes renal cell injury, inflammation, and fibrosis which finally lead to proteinuria, it is not surprising that ET ( A ) receptors antagonists have been proven to have beneficial renoprotective effects in both experimental and clinical studies in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD<ORGANIZATION>. Unfortunately, fluid retention encountered in large clinical trials in diabetic CKD<ORGANIZATION> led to the termination of these studies. Therefore, several advances, including the synthesis of new antagonists with enhanced pharmacological activity, the use of lower doses of ET<ORGANIZATION> antagonists, the addition of diuretics, plus simply searching for distinct pathological states to be treated, are promising targets for future experimental studies. In support of these approaches, our group demonstrated in adult subtotally nephrectomized Ren-2 transgenic rats that the addition of a diuretic on top of renin-angiotensin and ET<ORGANIZATION> ( A ) blockade led to a further decrease of proteinuria. This effect was independent of blood pressure which was normalized in all treated groups. Recent data in non-diabetic CKD<ORGANIZATION>, therefore, indicate a new potential for ET<ORGANIZATION> ( A ) antagonists, at least under certain pathological conditions.
