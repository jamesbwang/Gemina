 Late-life depression ( LLD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a growing worldwide problem due to demographic changes, with limited treatment options due to high rates of pharmacotherapy adverse effects, accessibility of psychotherapy, and tolerability of electroconvulsive therapy. Novel<PERSON> neuromodulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS<ORGANIZATION> ), may overcome these limitations. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy, tolerability, and cognitive effects of high-dose deep rTMS in LLD<ORGANIZATION>. In this study we randomized older adults between 60 and 85 years old with major depressive disorder ( MDD<ORGANIZATION> ) to sham or active deep rTMS<ORGANIZATION> ( H1 coil, 6012 pulses, 18 Hz, 120 % of resting motor threshold ) delivered over the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex 5 days per week over 4 weeks. Our primary outcome was remission of depression in an intention-to-treat analysis. We also assessed change in cognitive functioning with rTMS<ORGANIZATION> treatment and tolerability based on adverse effects. Fifty-two participants were randomized to active ( n = 25 ) or sham H1 coil ( n = 27 ). Remission rate was significantly higher with active than sham rTMS<ORGANIZATION> ( 40.0 % vs 14.8 % ) with a number needed to treat of 4.0 ( 95 % CI: 2.1-56.5 ). There was no change on any measure of executive function and no serious adverse events. Adverse effect profiles were similar between active and sham rTMS<ORGANIZATION>, except for reports of pain being significantly more common in the active condition ( 16.0 % vs 0 % ). High-dose deep rTMS<ORGANIZATION> appears to be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in the treatment of LLD<ORGANIZATION>.
