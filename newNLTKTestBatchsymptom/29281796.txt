 Blasiak<PERSON> A, Whyte GP<PERSON>, Matlak A<PERSON>, Brz√≥ska R<PERSON>, Sadlik B. Morphologic<PERSON> properties of cartilage lesions in the knee arthroscopically prepared by the standard curette technique are inferior to lesions prepared by specialized chondrectomy instruments. Am J Sports Med<PERSON>. 2018 ; 46 ( 4 ) :908-914. ( Original<ORGANIZATION> DOI: 10.1177/0363546517745489 ) There is an error in the Abstract<ORGANIZATION> of this article. The Conclusion<ORGANIZATION> of the Abstract<ORGANIZATION> currently reads: Arthroscopic cartilage lesion preparation with SC<ORGANIZATION> instruments results in superior perpendicularity of surrounding cartilage walls to subchondral bone and greater consistency of debrided lesion depth, as compared with the standard debridement technique with curettes. It should have read: Arthroscopic cartilage lesion preparation with CM<ORGANIZATION> instruments results in superior perpendicularity of surrounding cartilage walls to subchondral bone and greater consistency of debrided lesion depth, as compared with the standard debridement technique with curettes.
