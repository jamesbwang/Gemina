 In this study, we examined how any, full, and partial breastfeeding durations were associated with maternal risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ), and how prepregnancy body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ) and waist circumference 7 years postpartum influenced these associations. A total of 63,260 women with live-born singleton infants in the Danish National Birth Cohort<ORGANIZATION> ( 1996-2002 ) were included. Interviews during pregnancy and 6 and 18 months postpartum provided information on prepregnancy weight, height, and the duration of full and partial breastfeeding. Waist circumference was self-reported 7 years postpartum. Cox<PERSON> regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios of incident hypertension and CVD<ORGANIZATION>, registered in the National Patient<ORGANIZATION> Register from either 18 months or 7 years postpartum through 15 years postpartum. Any breastfeeding ≥4 months was associated with 20-30 % lower risks of hypertension and CVD<ORGANIZATION> compared to < 4 months in both normal/underweight and overweight/obese women. At follow-up starting 7 years postpartum, similar risk reductions were observed after accounting for waist circumference adjusted for BMI<ORGANIZATION>. Partial breastfeeding > 2 months compared to ≤2 months, following up to 6 months of full breastfeeding, was associated with 10-25 % lower risk of hypertension and CVD<ORGANIZATION>. Compared with short breastfeeding duration, additional partial breastfeeding was as important as additional full breastfeeding in reducing risk of hypertension and CVD<ORGANIZATION>. Altogether, longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with lower maternal risk of hypertension and CVD<ORGANIZATION> irrespective of prepregnancy BMI<ORGANIZATION> and abdominal adiposity 7 years after delivery. Both full and partial breastfeeding contributed to an improved cardiovascular health in mothers.
