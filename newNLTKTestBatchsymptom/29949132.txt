 In Australia<GPE>, there is an unmet need for improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ). Tofacitinib<PERSON> is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of RA<ORGANIZATION>. To provide an overview of key study outcomes for tofacitinib in Australian<GPE> patients, we analyzed the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in the Australian<GPE> subpopulation of global RA phase III<ORGANIZATION> and long-term extension ( LTE<ORGANIZATION> ) studies. Data were pooled from the Australian<GPE> subpopulation of four phase III<ORGANIZATION> studies and one LTE study ( database not locked at cut-off date: January 2016 ). Patients in the phase III<ORGANIZATION> studies received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily ( BID<ORGANIZATION> ), placebo ( advancing to tofacitinib at months 3 or 6 ), or adalimumab, with background methotrexate or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients in the LTE<ORGANIZATION> study received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID<ORGANIZATION>. Efficacy endpoints were American College<ORGANIZATION> of Rheumatology<GPE> ( ACR<ORGANIZATION> ) 20/50/70 response rates, and change from baseline in the Disease Activity Score<ORGANIZATION> in 28 joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ DAS28-4 ( ESR<ORGANIZATION> ) ] and Health Assessment<PERSON> Questionnaire-Disability Index ( HAQ-DI ) scores. Safety endpoints included incidence of adverse events ( AEs<ORGANIZATION> ), serious AEs<ORGANIZATION>, and discontinuations due to AEs<ORGANIZATION>. AEs of special interest and laboratory parameters were analyzed in the LTE<ORGANIZATION> study. Across phase III<ORGANIZATION> studies ( N = 100 ), ACR<ORGANIZATION> response rates and improvements in DAS28-4<GPE> ( ESR<ORGANIZATION> ) and HAQ-DI scores were numerically greater with tofacitinib vs. placebo at month 3, and increased until month 12. The results were sustained in the LTE<ORGANIZATION> study ( N = 99 ) after 60 months ' observation. In general, the efficacy and safety profiles of tofacitinib were similar to those of the global RA population. In Australian<GPE> patients with RA<ORGANIZATION>, tofacitinib therapy demonstrated sustained efficacy and consistent safety over â‰¥ 60 months ' treatment. Pfizer<PERSON> Inc.
