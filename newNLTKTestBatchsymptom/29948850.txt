 Hepatitis<PERSON> C virus ( HCV<ORGANIZATION> ) is a global health concern, notably in Southeast Asia<LOCATION>, and in Laos<GPE> the presentation of the HCV-induced liver disease is poorly known. Our objective was thus to describe a comprehensive HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection pattern in order to guide national health policies. A study on a group of 1765 patients formerly diagnosed by rapid test in health centres was conducted at the Centre<ORGANIZATION> of Infectiology Lao Christophe Merieux<ORGANIZATION> in Vientiane<GSP>. The demographic information of patients, their infection status ( viral load: VL ), liver function ( aminotransferases ) and treatments were analysed. Results<PERSON> showed that gender distribution of infected people was balanced ; with median ages of 53.8 for men and 51.6 years for women ( 13-86 years ). The majority of patients ( 72 % ) were confirmed positive ( VL<ORGANIZATION> > 50 IU/mL ) and 28 % of them had high VL ( > 6log
