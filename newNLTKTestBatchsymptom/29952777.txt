 We present 2 unique cases of exertional supraspinatus syndrome related to overexertion in 2 young men. In both cases, the diagnosis was delayed because the symptom was nonspecific shoulder pain ; however, progressive pain, an elevated creatine kinase ( CK ) level, and either increased compartmental pressures or findings on magnetic resonance imaging eventually led to the appropriate diagnosis. The terms `` supraspinatus compartment syndrome '' and `` supraspinatus rhabdomyolysis '' are inappropriately used interchangeably. We believe that both conditions are part of a spectrum of pathology called exertional supraspinatus syndrome. It is important to differentiate between these conditions because a patient with supraspinatus compartment syndrome, which is distinguished by elevated compartment pressures, requires an immediate fasciotomy.
