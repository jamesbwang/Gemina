 The main purpose of this research study was to evaluate changes in fatigue, stress and vigilance amongst commercially licensed truck drivers involved in a prolonged driving task. The secondary purpose was to determine if a new ergonomic seat could help reduce both physical and cognitive fatigue during a prolonged driving task. Two different truck seats were evaluated: industrial standard seat and a new truck seat prototype. Twenty<PERSON> male truck drivers were recruited to attend two testing sessions, on two separate days with each session randomized for seat design. During each session participants perform two 10-minute simulated driving tasks. Between<PERSON> simulated sessions participants drove a long-haul truck for 90-minutes. Fatigue<PERSON> and stress were quantified using a series of questionnaires whereas vigilance was measured using a standardized computer test. Seat interactions had a significant effect on fatigue patterns. The new ergonomic seat design holds potential in improving road safety and vehicle accidents due to fatigue related accidents.
