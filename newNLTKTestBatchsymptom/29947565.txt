 Felt<GPE> or enacted criticism was identified as a significant influence on White British<FACILITY> parents ' decision making during acute childhood illness in a substantive grounded theory `` Containing acute childhood illness within family life. '' These parents sought to avoid further criticism, sometimes leading to delayed consultation. Using Glaserian<GPE> grounded theory principles, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from three studies, to establish the transferability and modifiability of the original theory to other settings and communities in Ireland<GPE> and England<GPE>. Felt<PERSON> or enacted criticism was found to operate across the childhood age range, social groups, and settings. Parent<PERSON> 's strategies to avoid criticism reduced contacts with health professionals, access to support and, more worryingly, communication about their child 's health. These findings demonstrate the wider applicability, or `` work '' in Glaser<GPE> 's terms, of the concept in the English<GPE> speaking Western<LOCATION> world. Findings indicate the need for nurses to identify and mitigate sources of criticism.
