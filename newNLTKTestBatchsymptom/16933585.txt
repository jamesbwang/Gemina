 People with schizophrenia are at considerably higher risk of cardiometabolic morbidity than the general population. Second-generation antipsychotic drugs contribute to that risk partly through their weight gain effects, exacerbating an already high burden of disease. While standard 'as-randomized ' analyses of clinical trials provide valuable information, they ignore adherence patterns across treatment arms, confounding estimates of realized treatment exposure on outcome. We assess the effect of specific second-generation antipsychotics on weight gain, defined as at least a 7 % increase in weight from randomization, using a Bayesian<GPE> hierarchical model network meta-analysis with individual patient level data. Our data consisted of 14 randomized clinical trials contributing 5923 subjects ( mean age = 39 [ SD = 12 ] ) assessing various combinations of olanzapine ( n = 533 ), paliperidone ( n = 3482 ), risperidone ( n = 540 ), and placebo ( n = 1368 ). The median time from randomization to dropout or trial completion was 6 weeks ( range: 0-60 weeks ). The unadjusted probability of weight gain in the placebo group was 4.8 % across trials. For each 10 g chlorpromazine equivalent dose increase in olanzapine, the odds of weight gain increased by 5 ( 95 % credible interval: 1.4, 5.3 ) ; the effect of risperidone ( odds ratio = 1.6 [ 0.25, 9.1 ] ) was estimated with considerable uncertainty but no different from paliperidone ( odds ratio = 1.3 [ 1.2, 1.5 ] ).
