 This study aims to investigate the prevalence of physical restraint among mechanically ventilated ICU<ORGANIZATION> patients in Jordan<GPE>, and to identify predicting factors and consequences. Physical Restraint<PERSON> ( PR ) has been widely used among Intensive Care Unit<ORGANIZATION> ( ICU<ORGANIZATION> ) patients in many countries. Despite the benefits it offers in protecting patients from disrupting their medical treatment, it has been reported that restraint has many physical and psychological adverse effects. A cross-sectional and observational study was conducted during a period of three months ( April to June 2017 ). A sample of 321 ICU patients was selected from five governmental and one university affiliated hospital in the north and middle of Jordan<GPE>. The Restraint Prevalence Tool<ORGANIZATION> was used to collect data from the patients. The study found that the prevalence of physical restraint use on ICU<ORGANIZATION> patients in Jordan<GPE> was 35.8 %. This prevalence rate varied across the units, ranging from 33.3 % to 57.1 %. The factors that predicted physical restraint use were younger age ( odds ratio = 0.96 ), large ICU<ORGANIZATION> ( odds ratio = 6.14 ), the surgical ICU<ORGANIZATION> ( odds ratio = 10.36 ), the night shift ( odds ratio = 3.57 ), a conscious patient ( odds ratio = 2.24 ), and longer hospital stay ( odds ratio = 1.07 ). However, hospital type, gender, and being on chemical restraint were not significantly associated with physical restraint. Many patients were observed to have physical complications from restraint use, such as redness, bruising and edema. Physical restraint is a common practice in Jordan<GPE>. Not following standard restraint practices may lead to many physical complications among ICU<ORGANIZATION> patients. This study recommends implementing more policies/guidelines inside Jordanian<GPE> hospitals. In addition, nursing education programs on the safe use of physical restraint should be implemented.
