 Von<PERSON> Hippel-Landau ( VHL<ORGANIZATION> ) disease is characterized by malignant and benign tumors in multiple organs. Sunitinib<PERSON>, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been clinically available for treating sporadic patients with recurrent or unresectable and metastatic clear renal cell carcinomas ( cRCCs<ORGANIZATION> ) and metastatic lesions of the lung, but its effect on VHL<ORGANIZATION> disease-associated tumors remains poorly understood. This retrospective case series examined the effect of sunitinib on RCC<ORGANIZATION>, hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in patients with confirmed VHL<ORGANIZATION>. Of note, three patients with VHL<ORGANIZATION> disease who were treated with sunitinib were identified from a review of their medical records. The efficacy of sunitinib was evaluated by comparing computed tomography ( CT ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) scans conducted before and after treatment. Adverse side effects associated with sunitinib were assessed and recorded. All three patients with VHL<ORGANIZATION> disease exhibited clinical improvement after treatment with sunitinib. Patient 1 exhibited a decrease in the size of both their pheochromocytoma and RCC<ORGANIZATION> after 19 months of sunitinib treatment. RCCs in Patients 2 and 3 exhibited stable response to sunitinib for approximately 1 and 6 years, respectively. All the patients reported tolerable side effects. Therefore sunitinib treatment was associated with either partial response or stable control of VHL-related RCCs, pheochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( NET<ORGANIZATION> ) with acceptable side effects. Further evaluation of sunitinib in patients with VHL<ORGANIZATION> disease in larger prospective studies is warranted.
