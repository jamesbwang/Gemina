 TAR<ORGANIZATION> DNA-binding protein ( TDP-43 ) pathology in the motor neurons is the most reliable pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS<ORGANIZATION> ), and motor neurons bearing TDP-43 pathology invariably exhibit failure in RNA<ORGANIZATION> editing at the GluA2<ORGANIZATION> glutamine/arginine ( Q/R ) site due to down-regulation of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA<ORGANIZATION> 2 ( ADAR2<ORGANIZATION> ). Conditional ADAR2<ORGANIZATION> knockout ( AR2<ORGANIZATION> ) mice display ALS-like phenotype, including progressive motor dysfunction due to loss of motor neurons. Motor neurons devoid of ADAR2<ORGANIZATION> express Q/R site-unedited GluA2<ORGANIZATION>, and AMPA<ORGANIZATION> receptors with unedited GluA2 in their subunit assembly are abnormally permeable to Ca
