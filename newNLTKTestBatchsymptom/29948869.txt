 Retrospective studies indicate that acetaminophen iv administration reduces hospital length of stay ( LoS<ORGANIZATION> ) and opiate consumption in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. This study sought to determine whether using acetaminophen iv in morbidly obese subjects undergoing sleeve gastrectomy decreased LoS<ORGANIZATION> and total hospital charges as compared to patients receiving saline placebo. Single-center university hospital METHODS<ORGANIZATION>: Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, subjects were assigned to receive either acetaminophen iv ( group A ) or saline placebo iv ( group P ). Data were collected between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2016. Group A<PERSON> received acetaminophen every 6 h for a total of four doses. The first dose was administered following the induction of general anesthesia ; group P<PERSON> received saline iv on the same schedule. Anesthetic management and prophylactic antiemetic regimen were standardized in all subjects. Postoperative pain management consisted of hydromorphone via patient-controlled infusion pump. Primary outcomes include hospital LoS<ORGANIZATION> and associated hospital costs. Secondary outcomes include patient satisfaction and postoperative nausea and pain scores. Subject demographics ( n = 127 ) and intraoperative management were similar in the two groups. Across all subjects, median hospital LoS<ORGANIZATION> in group A ( n = 63 ) was 1.87 vs. 1.97 days in group P ( n = 64 ) ( p = 0.03, Wilcoxon<PERSON> rank-sum test ). Postoperatively, daily quality-of-recovery ( QoR-15 ) scores, narcotic consumption, and the use of rescue antiemetics were not significantly different between groups. Median<GPE> hospital costs were as follows: group A, $ 12,885 vs. group P, $ 12,977 ( n = 64 ). Acetaminophen iv may reduce hospital LoS<ORGANIZATION> in subjects undergoing sleeve gastrectomy.
