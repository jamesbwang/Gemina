 Electroconvulsive<GPE> therapy ( ECT<ORGANIZATION> ) is an effective treatment in mania. However, there is little evidence regarding the use of ultrabrief right unilateral ( RUL-UB ) ECT in treatment of acute manic episodes. The aim of this study was to report on the effectiveness and cognitive profile of ECT<ORGANIZATION> in bipolar mania, including a sample who received RUL-UB ECT. This naturalistic study retrospectively collected data in 33 patients who received ECT<ORGANIZATION> with concurrent antipsychotics for mania between October 1, 2014, and July 30, 2016. Electroconvulsive therapy was given using RUL-UB, brief-pulse right unilateral, or brief-pulse bitemporal approaches, dosed according to the patient 's seizure threshold. The Brief Psychiatric<ORGANIZATION> Rating Scale ( BPRS<ORGANIZATION> ), Young Mania Rating Scale<PERSON> ( YMRS<ORGANIZATION> ) score, and the Montreal<ORGANIZATION> Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA<ORGANIZATION> ) were administered to patients before and after the ECT<ORGANIZATION> course. For the whole sample, there was a significant improvement in BPRS<GPE> ( total score and manic subscale ), YMRS<ORGANIZATION>, and MoCA<ORGANIZATION> total scores across the ECT<ORGANIZATION> treatment course. The overall BPRS<ORGANIZATION> response rate was 84 %, and mean scores decreased from 42.1 ( SD<ORGANIZATION>, 12.0 ) to 26.0 ( SD<ORGANIZATION>, 4.0 ). The 13 patients who received RUL-UB ECT also showed significant improvement in BPRS<GPE>, YMRS<ORGANIZATION>, and MoCA<ORGANIZATION> scores over the treatment course. Electroconvulsive therapy in general and also specifically RUL-UB ECT were effective in treating mania and also led to global cognitive improvement.
