 The German Cardiac Society<ORGANIZATION> ( DGK<ORGANIZATION> ) and the German Society<ORGANIZATION> for Thoracic<PERSON> and Cardiovascular Surgery<PERSON> ( DGTHG<ORGANIZATION> ) jointly advocated the initiation and certification of heart failure ( HF ) networks in a position statement in 2016. In these networks, supraregional HF centers cooperate with specialized regional HF clinics and registered cardiologists to improve intersectoral treatment of patients with HF<ORGANIZATION>. So far predominantly supraregional HF centers have achieved certification but more recently regional clinics as well as registered cardiologists have applied for certification, now enabling the comprehensive establishment of HF<ORGANIZATION> networks. In this article the background, the current situation and the future perspectives of HF<ORGANIZATION> networks are assessed and approaches for better networking are discussed.
