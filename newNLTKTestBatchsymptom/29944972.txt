 In the female genital tract, extra-uterine leiomyomas such as those that arise in the ovary and paraovarian/paratubal regions are rare. Currently<PERSON>, little is known about the background genetic changes in such adnexal leiomyomas. Recent studies have found that the MED12<ORGANIZATION> mutation is common in uterine leiomyomas, which suggests that such mutations may play an oncogenic role in smooth muscle neoplasms in females. Herein<PERSON>, we examined a series of ovarian and other adnexal leiomyomas in terms of MED12<ORGANIZATION> mutational status to investigate possible MED12<ORGANIZATION> involvement in the pathogenesis of extra-uterine smooth muscle tumors. We evaluated 10 cases of adnexal leiomyomas ( five ovarian, three paraovarian, and two paratubal ), and 49 cases of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors as controls. We performed polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing of exon 2 of MED12<ORGANIZATION>, and immunohistochemical staining for smooth muscle actin ( SMA<ORGANIZATION> ) and desmin. We identified somatic MED12<ORGANIZATION> mutations in 90 % ( 9/10 ) of the adnexal leiomyomas. None of the sex cord-stromal tumors in the control group harbored MED12<ORGANIZATION> mutations. Diffuse<PERSON> immunoreactivity for both SMA<ORGANIZATION> and desmin were characteristic of adnexal leiomyomas only. Thus, we conclude that ovarian leiomyomas are distinct from sex cord-stromal tumors. MED12<ORGANIZATION> mutations are key molecular features of ovarian and other adnexal leiomyomas. We speculate that the pathogenesis of adnexal leiomyoma is similar to that of its uterine counterpart.
