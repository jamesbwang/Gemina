 Several foods and nutrients have been independently associated with systolic ( SBP<ORGANIZATION> ) and diastolic ( DBP<ORGANIZATION> ) blood pressure values. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of combined dietary habits on SBP<ORGANIZATION> and DBP<ORGANIZATION> values in a large cohort of healthy adults, with a cross-sectional design. Adherence of participants to four a priori dietary patterns was considered: the Healthy<ORGANIZATION> Eating Index 2010 ( HEI-2010 ) ; the Dietary Approaches<ORGANIZATION> to Stop Hypertension<GPE> ( DASH<ORGANIZATION> ) ; the Greek Mediterranean Diet Score<ORGANIZATION> ( MDS<ORGANIZATION> ) ; and the Italian<GPE> Mediterranean Index<LOCATION> ( IMI<ORGANIZATION> ). Overall, 13,597 volunteers ( 35-64 years ) were enrolled in 1993-1998 in the EPIC-Florence cohort. Information on dietary habits, anthropometry, smoking status, education, physical activity habits, previous diagnosis of hypertension and SBP<ORGANIZATION> and DBP<ORGANIZATION> measurements were collected at baseline. Multivariate regression models were performed on 10,163 individuals ( 7551 women ) after excluding subjects with prevalent hypertension. IMI<ORGANIZATION>, DASH<ORGANIZATION> and HEI-2010 were significantly and inversely associated with SBP<ORGANIZATION> and DBP<ORGANIZATION> values in the total population. The strongest association emerged between IMI<ORGANIZATION> and SBP<ORGANIZATION> ( β - 1.80 excellent adherence vs low adherence, 95 % CI<ORGANIZATION> - 2.99 ; - 0.61, p trend 0.001 ) and DBP<ORGANIZATION> ( β - 1.12, 95 % CI<ORGANIZATION> - 1.869 ; - 0.39, p trend 0.001 ) values. In sub-group analyses, an inverse association also emerged between IMI<ORGANIZATION> and SBP<ORGANIZATION> and DBP<ORGANIZATION> values among females and between DASH<ORGANIZATION> and DBP<ORGANIZATION> among males. MDS<ORGANIZATION> was not associated with SBP<ORGANIZATION> or DBP<ORGANIZATION>. Overall, this study, carried out in a large cohort of healthy adults from Tuscany<GPE> ( Central Italy<ORGANIZATION> ), showed inverse significant associations between specific a priori dietary patterns, identifying general models of health-conscious diet, and blood pressure values.
