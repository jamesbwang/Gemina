 To estimate the prevalence of disordered eating behaviors and the association with energy and nutrient intake and nutritional status in adolescents. A school-based cross-sectional study was performed involving a probabilistic sample of 487 teenagers ( aged 15-19 years ) from public schools in the Metropolitan<ORGANIZATION> area of Rio<ORGANIZATION> de Janeiro<PERSON>, Brazil<GPE>. The Eating Attitude Test and the Bulimic Investigatory Test<ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh questionnaires were applied to identify abnormal eating patterns and unusual dietary patterns, respectively. Nutritional status was defined by sex- and age-specific body mass index cutoffs. Energy<PERSON> and nutrient intake were assessed by a 3-day food record. The association between variables was assessed by the prevalence ratio and 95 % confidence intervals, Pearson<PERSON> 's Chi-square test, and linear regression. The prevalence of abnormal eating patterns was 7.4 % and that of unusual dietary patterns was 18.9 %. Vitamin C<PERSON> intake was higher among girls with abnormal dietary patterns, with a consequent lower frequency of vitamin C deficiency when compared to those with normal dietary patterns. Calcium<PERSON> intake was lower in boys with unusual dietary pattern than in those without this behavior. Excess weight was associated with the presence of unusual dietary pattern in girls ( PR: 2.4, 95 % CI 1.6-3.5 ). The prevalence of disordered eating behaviors was high, mainly in those who were overweight. It was associated with lower calcium intake in boys and with higher Vitamin C<PERSON> intake in girls. Level V<PERSON>, descriptive studies.
