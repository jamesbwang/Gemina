 Amyotrophic<GPE> lateral sclerosis ( ALS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and the spinal cord. Due<PERSON> to the progressive neurodegeneration, ALS<ORGANIZATION> leads to paralysis and death caused by respiratory failure 2-5 years after the onset of symptoms. There is no effective cure available. Most ALS cases are sporadic, without family history, whereas 10 % of the cases are familial. Identification of variants in more than 30 different loci has provided insight into the pathogenic molecular mechanisms mediating disease pathogenesis. Studies of a Drosophila melanogaster model for each of the ALS<ORGANIZATION> genes can contribute to uncovering pathophysiological mechanism of ALS<ORGANIZATION> and finding targets of the disease-modifying therapy. In this review, we focus on three ALS-causing genes: TAR<ORGANIZATION> DNA-binding protein ( TDP-43 ), fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma ( FUS/TLS ), and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 ( C9orf72<ORGANIZATION> ).
