 INTRODUCTIONː The role of ultrasound imaging in urogynecology is not defined. Significant developments in visualization techniques and interpretation of images allowed to study structures of the lower genitourinary tract and pelvic floor. EVIDENCE<ORGANIZATION> ACQUISITIONː PubMed and Scopus<GPE> database were searched for publications on the following item: stress urinary incontinence, ultrasound, perineal ultrasound and preoperative and postoperative assessment. EVIDENCE<ORGANIZATION> SYNTHESISː The role of ultrasound in urogynecology could be helpful in diagnosing of urinary incontinence and urethral hypermobility, to document pelvic floor anatomy and to assess anatomic and functional changes before and after surgery.
