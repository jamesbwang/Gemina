 Spatial<GPE> variations of Cr<GPE>, Cu<GPE>, Hg<GPE>, Ni<GPE>, Pb<GPE>, and Zn in the surface sediments from 34 stations of the Kaohsiung<ORGANIZATION> coastal zone southwestern Taiwan<GPE> were studied to address the current pollution status, sediment quality, and potential ecological risk. The study revealed that the concentrations of sediment metals in Kaohsiung<GPE> Harbor were alarmingly high compared to the other region of Kaohsiung<GPE> coast. The concentrations of Cr<GPE>, Cu<GPE>, Hg<GPE>, Ni<GPE>, Pb<GPE>, and Zn in the harbor sediments were as high as 351, 247, 1.93, 61.8, 60.9, and 940 mg kg
