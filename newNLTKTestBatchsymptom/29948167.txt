 The aim of the present study was to report experiences with invasive prenatal diagnosis of α-thalassemia for the prevention of Hb Bart<PERSON> 's hydrops fetalis syndrome in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region<ORGANIZATION>, China<GPE>. Pregnant women and their partners who tested positive for α An invasive prenatal α-thalassemia diagnosis was performed in 3155 cases at risk for Hb Bart<PERSON> 's hydrops fetalis syndrome at our hospital from 2002 to 2016. CVS<ORGANIZATION> was performed in 1559 cases ( 49.4 % ), amniocentesis in 1240 cases ( 39.3 % ) and cordocentesis in 356 cases ( 11.3 % ). In total, 786 fetuses were diagnosed as Hb Bart<PERSON> 's hydrops fetalis syndrome. Among these cases, the α-thalassemia genotype was -- This extensive experience suggests that carrier screening, molecular diagnostics, genetic counselling, and prenatal diagnosis are effective measures to prevent Hb Bart<PERSON> 's hydrops fetalis syndrome.
