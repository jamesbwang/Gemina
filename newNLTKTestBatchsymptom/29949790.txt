 Metformin<GPE> treatment is reported to be associated with a lower incidence of and mortality from pancreatic cancer ( PC ) in type 2 diabetes patients. Activated pancreatic stellate cells ( PSCs<ORGANIZATION> ) are key stroma cells responsible for pancreatic fibrogenesis and PC progression. However, little research is about the influence of metformin on PSCs<ORGANIZATION>. Given the potential beneficial effects of metformin on PC, pancreatic tumour stroma is an important target for new therapeutics. We observed the effects of metformin on PSCs<ORGANIZATION>. We investigated the effects of metformin on human PSCs<ORGANIZATION> proliferation and the production of extracellular matrix ( ECM<ORGANIZATION> ) proteins. Cells were cultured with different concentrations of metformin ( 0-10 mmol/L ). Cell<PERSON> proliferation was determined by immunofluorescence staining for nuclear Ki67 labelling. ECM production was studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Adenosine<PERSON> monophosphate-activated protein kinase ( AMPK<ORGANIZATION> ), an important regulatory molecule responsible for metformin action, and the organic cation transporter member 1 ( OCT1<ORGANIZATION> ), which is believed to be the most important transporter for the pharmacological action of metformin, were investigated for their possible involvements in metformin-induced proliferation and ECM<ORGANIZATION> production. Our results showed that metformin inhibited PSCs<ORGANIZATION> proliferation and decreased the production of ECM<ORGANIZATION> proteins by activation of AMPK<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation. Silencing of OCT1<ORGANIZATION> expression resulted in a reduction in the effects of metformin on PSCs<ORGANIZATION> activity. Collectively, the data indicate that OCT1<ORGANIZATION> may contribute to uptake metformin and regulate PSCs<ORGANIZATION> activity. OCT1<ORGANIZATION> is a target of metformin in regulating PSCs<ORGANIZATION> activity.
