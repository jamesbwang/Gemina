 Electroconvulsive<GPE> therapy ( ECT<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most effective treatment for mood disorders. Accumulating evidence has suggested the important role of circadian genes in mood disorders. However, the effects of ECT<ORGANIZATION> on circadian genes have not been systemically investigated. We examined the expression and daily oscillation of major circadian genes in the rat frontal cortex after electroconvulsive seizure ( ECS<ORGANIZATION> ). Firstly, mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein level were investigated at 24 hr after single ECS<ORGANIZATION> ( E1X ) and repeated ECS<ORGANIZATION> treatements for 10 days ( E10X<ORGANIZATION> ), which showed more remarkable changes after E10X<PERSON> than E1X<PERSON>. mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression of Rorα<GPE>, Bmal1<PERSON>, Clock<GPE>, Per1<PERSON>, and Cry1<PERSON> was decreased, while Rev-erbα expression was increased at 24 hr after E10X<PERSON> compared to sham. The proteins showed similar pattern of changes. Next, the effects on oscillation and rhythm properties ( mesor, amplitude, and acrophase ) were examined, which also showed more prominent changes after E10X<PERSON> than E1X<PERSON>. After E10X<PERSON>, mesor of Rorα<GPE>, Bmal1<PERSON>, and Cry1<PERSON> was reduced, and that of Rev-erbα was increased. Five genes, Rev-erbα, Bmal1<PERSON>, Per1<PERSON>, Per2<PERSON>, and Cry2<PERSON>, showed earlier acrophase after E10X<PERSON>. The findings suggest that repeated ECS<ORGANIZATION> induces reduced expression and phase advance of major circadian genes in the in vivo rat frontal cortex.
