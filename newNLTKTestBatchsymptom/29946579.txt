 The aim of this literature review and case report was to point out the relationship between Cowden Syndrome<PERSON> ( CS ) and severe periodontitis. CS is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterised by skin and oral hamartomas, and is associated with an increased risk of cancer development. The case of a 43-year old male patient affected by Cowden<PERSON> syndrome and presenting severe periodontitis was reported. It can be suggested that the specific gingival morphology of the patient with CS<ORGANIZATION> might be a risk factor for the development of periodontal disease, as described in the present case report. Early diagnosis is crucial in patients affected by CS<ORGANIZATION>. The dentist may be the first to notice any atypical changes in the oral cavity and refer the patient for further examinations. Moreover, the mucosal and skin changes have a tendency to appear prior to the malignancies associated with the syndrome. This highlights the responsibility of the dentist in the early diagnosis of this progressive pathological syndrome.
