 To determine the immediate effect of neural tension technique ( NTT<ORGANIZATION> ) on conditioned pain modulation in patients with chronic neck pain. A secondary objective was to determine the immediate effect of neural tensioner technique on pain intensity and cervical range of movement. Randomized<PERSON> clinical trial. University<ORGANIZATION> medical center. Fifty-four patients with neck pain ( 13 males and 41 females ; mean± SD age = 20.91 ± 2.64 years ) were randomly allocated to two groups: NTT or sham technique. Participants received a visual analog scale ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> ) and neck disability index ( NDI<ORGANIZATION> ) after inclusion. Conditioned pain modulation ( CPM<ORGANIZATION> ) and active cervical range of motion were measured before and after the intervention. Each subject received one treatment session. The results of the analysis of variance revealed a significant effect for the group × time interaction only for CPM<ORGANIZATION> ( F = 11.09, P<PERSON> = 0.002, ηp2 = 0.176 ). No significant interactions were found for the other measures ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> [ F = 1.719, P<PERSON> = 0.195, ηp2 = 0.031 ], pressure pain threshold C2 [ F = 0.731, P<PERSON> = 0.398, ηp2 = 0.018 ], flexion [ F = 0.176, P<PERSON> = 0.677, ηp2 = 0.003 ], extension [ F = 0.035, P<PERSON> = 0.852, ηp2 = 0.001 ], lateral flexions [ F = 0.422, P<PERSON> = 0.519, ηp2 = 0.008 ], and rotations [ F = 1.307 P = 0.258, ηp2 = 0.024 ] ). Regarding CPM<ORGANIZATION>, intergroup interaction differences were found postintervention ( P<PERSON> = 0.002 ) with a high effect size ( d = 0.98 ). This study suggests that neural tension technique enhances immediate conditioned pain modulation in patients with chronic neck pain, but not pain intensity or cervical range of movement.
