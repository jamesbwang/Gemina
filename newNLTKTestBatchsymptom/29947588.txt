 Naturally occurring hormone cycles in adult female humans and rodents create a dynamic neuroendocrine environment. These cycles include the menstrual cycle in humans, and its counterpart in rodents, the estrous cycle. These hormone fluctuations induce sex differences in the phenotypes of many behaviors, including those related to motivation, and associated disorders such as depression and addiction. This suggests that the neural substrate instrumental for these behaviors, including the nucleus accumbens core ( AcbC<ORGANIZATION> ), likewise differs between estrous cycle phases. It is unknown if the electrophysiological properties of AcbC<ORGANIZATION> output neurons, medium spiny neurons ( MSNs<ORGANIZATION> ), change between estrous cycle phases. This is a critical knowledge gap given that MSN<ORGANIZATION> electrophysiological properties are instrumental for determining AcbC<ORGANIZATION> output to efferent targets. Here we test whether the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of adult rat AcbC<ORGANIZATION> MSNs differs across female estrous cycle phases and to males. We recorded MSNs<ORGANIZATION> using whole cell patch-clamp technique in two experiments: the first using gonad-intact adult males and females in differing phases of the estrous cycle, and the second using gonadectomized males and females wherein estrous cycle was eliminated. MSN<ORGANIZATION> intrinsic electrophysiological and excitatory synaptic input properties robustly changed between female estrous cycle phases and males. Sex differences in MSN<ORGANIZATION> electrophysiology disappeared when the estrous cycle was eliminated. These novel findings indicate that AcbC<ORGANIZATION> MSN electrophysiological properties change across the estrous cycle, providing a new framework for understanding how biological sex and hormone cyclicity regulate motivated behaviors and other AcbC<ORGANIZATION> functions and disorders.
