 Apoptotic<GPE> intestinal crypt cells are pathognomonic of acute intestinal graft versus host disease ( GVHD<ORGANIZATION> ). Serum levels of the apoptotic degradation product cytokeratin-18 fragments ( CK18F<ORGANIZATION> ) were associated with acute hepato-intestinal GVHD<ORGANIZATION>. Here we present a prospective clinical observational trial ( NCT00935324<ORGANIZATION> ) investigating serum levels of total CK18<ORGANIZATION> ( tCK18<ORGANIZATION> ) and apoptotic CK18F to predict imminent acute hepato-intestinal GVHD<ORGANIZATION> and response to treatment. Total<GPE> ( t ) CK18<ORGANIZATION> and CK18F<ORGANIZATION> kinetics were measured before transplantation and in weekly intervals thereafter. In total 109 patients were enrolled. Acute<PERSON> hepato-intestinal GVHD<ORGANIZATION> grade I-IV was suspected in 36 patients ( 33 % ) at a median of 56 days post-transplant, 12 of these patients developed steroid-refractory GVHD<ORGANIZATION>. Both tCK18<ORGANIZATION> and apoptotic CK18F<ORGANIZATION> increased at GVHD<ORGANIZATION> onset, and distinguished patients with suspected acute hepato-intestinal GVHD who were negative in intestinal histology. In patients with clinical acute hepato-intestinal GVHD<ORGANIZATION>, tCK18 significantly raised already 7-14 days before symptom onset. In receiver operator characteristics, areas under the curve at GVHD<ORGANIZATION> onset were 0.927 ( p < 0.001 ) for tCK18<ORGANIZATION> and 0.875 ( p < 0.001 ) for apoptotic CK18F<ORGANIZATION> for patients with proven hepato-intestinal acute GVHD<ORGANIZATION>. This prospective study validates CK18F<ORGANIZATION> and highlights tCK18 as specific biomarkers suitable for improving prediction and diagnosis of suspected imminent and clinically manifest acute hepato-intestinal GVHD<ORGANIZATION>.
