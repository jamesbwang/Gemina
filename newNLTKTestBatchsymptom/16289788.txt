 Neurocysticercosis<GPE> ( NCC<ORGANIZATION> ), a common cause of seizures in children from low and middle income countries ( LMICs<ORGANIZATION> ), if not diagnosed and treated early enough may lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. There is a lack of data on the prevalence of NCC<ORGANIZATION> and its clinical characteristics among those with seizure in South-Western Nepal. To study the prevalence and clinical characteristics of NCC<ORGANIZATION> in children with seizures. All children admitted to Universal College<ORGANIZATION> of Medical Sciences<ORGANIZATION>, a tertiary hospital in South-Western Nepal with seizures during 2014-16, were tested for NCC<ORGANIZATION>. NCC<ORGANIZATION> was diagnosed by neuroimaging [ computerized tomography ( CT ) scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) ]. We used logistic regression to test the association between NCC<ORGANIZATION> with participants ' characteristics and clinical symptoms. Among 4962 in-patient children, 168 ( 104 boys and 64 girls ) had seizures ( 138 with generalized tonic clonic seizures ( GTCS<ORGANIZATION> ) and 30 with focal seizures ). 43 % of children with seizures had CT<ORGANIZATION> scan confirmed NCC<ORGANIZATION>. The prevalence of NCC<ORGANIZATION> in the oldest children ( 13-16 years ) was significantly greater ( 57.1 % versus 15.6 % ) compared to the youngest ( 0-4 years ) one ( This study shows that NCC<ORGANIZATION> contributes significantly to higher prevalence of seizures in children in South-Western<GPE> region of Nepal<GPE>.
