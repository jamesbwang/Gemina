 Simple<GPE> metabolites released during physical exercise and fasting like lactate ( Lac ) and β-hydroxybutyrate ( BHB<ORGANIZATION> ) have recently been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effects of these metabolites in immune mediated hepatitis are still unknown. Accordingly, we investigated the role of Lac<GPE>, BHB<ORGANIZATION> and their combination on experimentally induced hepatic inflammation. Adult<PERSON> male mice were administered concanavalin A ( Con<ORGANIZATION> A, 15 mg/kg, intravenous ) for 12 h. In the treatment groups, mice were treated 1 h after Con<ORGANIZATION> A-intoxication with Lac<GPE> ( 500 mg/kg, intraperitoneal ), BHB<ORGANIZATION> ( 300 mg/kg, intraperitoneal ) and their combination. The results demonstrated that Lac<PERSON> and BHB<ORGANIZATION>, especially when combined together, alleviated Con<ORGANIZATION> A-induced hepatocellular injury ( ALT<ORGANIZATION>, AST<ORGANIZATION> and LDH<ORGANIZATION> ) and necrosis ( hematoxylin-eosin and electron microscopy ). These beneficial effects correlated with attenuating Con<ORGANIZATION> A-induced elevation in hepatic oxidative stress parameters ( MDA<ORGANIZATION> and NOx<ORGANIZATION> ). Mechanistically<PERSON>, administration of Lac<ORGANIZATION> and BHB<ORGANIZATION> led to inhibition of Con<ORGANIZATION> A-induced phosphorylation of JNK<ORGANIZATION> and AMPK<ORGANIZATION> proteins in the liver to the same extent. These effects were concordant with curbing Con<ORGANIZATION> A-mediated overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12 and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. The marked anti-inflammatory properties of combining Lac<PERSON> and BHB<ORGANIZATION> were attributed to their cooperation in repressing immune cells ( monocytes and neutrophils ) infiltration to the liver. Unlike BHB<ORGANIZATION>, Lac<PERSON> administration markedly induced the reparative STAT3 and ERK<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation in the livers of Con<ORGANIZATION> A-intoxicated mice at the early time point. In conclusion, the simultaneous use of Lac<ORGANIZATION> and BHB<ORGANIZATION> might be an auspicious strategy for limiting immune mediated hepatitis.
