 Poverty<GPE> and human capital development are inextricably linked and therefore research on human capital typically incorporates measures of economic well-being. In the context of randomized trials of health interventions, for example, such measures are used to: 1 ) assess baseline balance ; 2 ) estimate covariate-adjusted analyses ; and 3 ) conduct subgroup analyses. Many factors characterize economic well-being, however, and analysts often generate summary measures such as indices of household socio-economic status or wealth. In this paper, a household wealth index is developed and tested for participants in the cluster-randomized Sanitation, Hygiene<PERSON>, Infant Nutrition Efficacy<PERSON> ( SHINE<ORGANIZATION> ) trial in rural Zimbabwe. Building on the approach used in the Zimbabwe Demographic<ORGANIZATION> and Health Survey<PERSON> ( ZDHS<ORGANIZATION> ), we combined a set of housing characteristics, ownership of assets and agricultural resources into a wealth index using principal component analysis ( PCA<ORGANIZATION> ) on binary variables. The index was assessed for internal and external validity. Its sensitivity was examined considering an expanded set of variables and an alternative statistical approach of polychoric PCA<ORGANIZATION>. Correlation between indices was determined using the Spearman<ORGANIZATION> 's rank correlation coefficient and agreement between quintiles using a linear weighted Kappa statistic. Using the 2015 ZDHS<ORGANIZATION> data, we constructed a separate index and applied the loadings resulting from that analysis to the SHINE<ORGANIZATION> study population, to compare the wealth distribution in the SHINE<ORGANIZATION> study with rural Zimbabwe. The derived indices using the different methods were highly correlated ( r > 0.9 ), and the wealth quintiles derived from the different indices had substantial to near perfect agreement ( linear weighted Kappa<PERSON> > 0.7 ). The indices were strongly associated with a range of assets and other wealth measures, indicating both internal and external validity. Households<ORGANIZATION> in SHINE<ORGANIZATION> were modestly wealthier than the overall population of households in rural Zimbabwe. The SHINE<ORGANIZATION> wealth index developed here is a valid and robust measure of wealth in the sample.
