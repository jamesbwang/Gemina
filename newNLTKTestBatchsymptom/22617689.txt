 To provide a detailed description of characteristics at hospital admission and clinical outcomes at 30-day and 6-month follow-up in patients hospitalised with coronary artery disease ( CAD<ORGANIZATION> ) in a poor South-East Asian<GPE> setting. Prospective observational cohort study. From February 2013 to December 2014, in Makassar<GPE> Cardiac Center<PERSON>, Indonesia<GPE>. 477 patients with CAD<ORGANIZATION> ( acute coronary syndrome and stable CAD ). All-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE<ORGANIZATION> ). Out of 477 patients with CAD<ORGANIZATION>, the proportion of young age ( < 60 years ) was 53.9 % and 72.7 % were male. At admission, 44.2 % of patients were diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI<ORGANIZATION> ), 38.6 % with diagnosis or signs of heart failure and 75.1 % had previous hypertension. Out of 211 patients with STEMI<ORGANIZATION>, only 4.7 % had been treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI<ORGANIZATION> ) and 6.2 % received thrombolysis. The time lapse from symptom onset to hospital admission was 26.8 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 10.0-48.0 ) hours, and 19.1 % of all patients had undergone either PCI<ORGANIZATION> or coronary artery bypass graft. The survival rate at 6 months was 78.9 %. The rates of all-cause mortality at 30 days and 6 months were 13.4 % and 7.3 %, respectively ; the rate of composite MACE<ORGANIZATION> at 30 days was 26.2 % and 18.0 % at 6 months. Patients with CAD<ORGANIZATION> from a poor South-East Asian<GPE> setting present themselves with predominantly unstable conditions of premature CAD<ORGANIZATION>. These patients show relatively severe illness, have significant time delay from symptom onset to admission or intervention, and most do not receive the guidelines-recommended treatment. Awareness of symptoms, prompt initial management of acute CVD<ORGANIZATION>, well-established infrastructures and resources both in primary and secondary hospital for CVD<ORGANIZATION> should be improved to reduce the high rates of 30-day and 6-month mortality and adverse outcomes in this population.
