 Ectoine<GPE> ( ECT<ORGANIZATION> ) is a compatible solute synthesized mostly by halophilic microorganisms subjected to various stressful factors. Its protective properties in bacteria and some populations of isolated cells subjected to different stressors are reported ; however, little is known on its effects against a commonly used compound, ethanol ( ETH<ORGANIZATION> ). The purpose of our study was to determine the effects of ETH<ORGANIZATION> alone ( at 20 and 60 g/L ) and in the combination with various concentrations of ECT<ORGANIZATION> ( 5, 10, and 25 mg/L ) at various times of exposure on behavioural, physiological, and biochemical parameters of a model invertebrate Daphnia<GPE> magna. In the present study, we determined the following parameters: immobilisation, heart rate, thoracic limb movement, catalase ( CAT<ORGANIZATION> ) activity, and nitric oxide species ( NO
