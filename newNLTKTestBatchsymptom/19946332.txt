 Platinum-based drugs are used extensively in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC<ORGANIZATION> ), but their use can be limited by resistance. In this study, we established cisplatin ( DDP<ORGANIZATION> ) resistant TNBC<ORGANIZATION> cells to investigate the potential relationship among ETS1<ORGANIZATION>, IKKα/NF-κB and resistance. The sensitivity was evaluated by MTT<ORGANIZATION>, apoptosis analysis. The intracellular DDP<ORGANIZATION> concentration difference was tested by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) method. Molecular pathological mechanism of DDP<ORGANIZATION> resistance was explored by microarray analysis and PPI<ORGANIZATION> network analysis. The ETS1<ORGANIZATION>, NF-κB signaling change were assessed by western blot and q-PCR in vitro and vivo. The existing binds between ETS1<ORGANIZATION> and the core IKKα<ORGANIZATION> promoter were found by luciferase assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation technique ( ChIP<ORGANIZATION> ). MDA-MB-231/DDP ( 231/DDP ) cell had a higher IC This study enables us to understand the functions of ETS1<ORGANIZATION> in TNBC<ORGANIZATION> chemotherapy and suggests that ETS1<ORGANIZATION> could be used as a novel marker of poor response to DDP<ORGANIZATION> and a potential therapeutic target for TNBC<ORGANIZATION> chemotherapy.
