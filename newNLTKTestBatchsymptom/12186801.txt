 A 10-month-old infant experienced cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation ( VF ). His electrocardiogram ( ECG<ORGANIZATION> ) at rest was within the normal range. Amiodarone<PERSON> was indispensable due to its refractoriness to defibrillation. After implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD<ORGANIZATION> ) implantation, ICD<ORGANIZATION> shock was delivered. ICD<ORGANIZATION> recordings documented VF<ORGANIZATION> and ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) triggered by premature ventricular contractions with an extremely short coupling interval ( 240 ms ), which were controlled by verapamil. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first infant with ScTdP<ORGANIZATION>. As the electrical storm with ScTdP<ORGANIZATION> occurs unpredictably, it can be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome.
