 Presentation of two typical cases with characteristic leopard retinopathy secondary to bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation ( BDUMP<ORGANIZATION> ) and idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome ( IUES<ORGANIZATION> ) and brief review of the literature about leopard spot retinopathy. A 43-year-old women, who was a known case of ovarian carcinoma, referred with gradual bilateral visual loss. In ophthalmic examination, subretinal fluid, multiple patchy subretinal hyperpigmented lesions and leopard spot chorioretinopathy were evident in her both eyes. Fluorescein<PERSON> angiography showed multiple nummular hyperfluorescent lesions surrounded by zones of hypofluorescence. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography revealed increased retinal thickness, subretinal fluid and RPE<ORGANIZATION> irregularities in both eyes. Enhanced<PERSON> depth imaging OCT<ORGANIZATION> ( EDI-OCT ) showed bilateral subfoveal choroidal thickening. During next 2-year follow-up, she underwent cataract surgery and later on developed neovascular glaucoma in her both eyes. The second case was a 45-year-old man who had developed decreased visual acuity in his left eye for 3 years. Anterior<PERSON> segment examination was unremarkable, and both eyes had normal intraocular pressure. No vitreous inflammation was observed. Fundoscopy<PERSON> revealed diffuse exudative retinal detachment in his left eye. Fluorescein<PERSON> angiography showed leopard spot retinopathy of posterior pole, and EDI-OCT disclosed subfoveal choroidal thickening. After exclusion of other causes of exudative retinal detachment and with diagnosis of IUES<ORGANIZATION>, he underwent intravitreal triamcinolone injection ( 2 mg ) which improved his final vision to 20/40. Leopard<PERSON> spot retinopathy is an uncommon but clinically distinct manifestation of various disorders. BDUMP<ORGANIZATION> may present with leopard spot retinopathy, anterior uveal tract involvement and neovascular glaucoma. As EDI-OCT showed involvement and increased thickening of choroid in both cases of BDUMP<ORGANIZATION> and IUES<ORGANIZATION>, it may be better to consider such cases as leopard chorioretinopathy and categorize these entities as a member of pachychoroid pigment retinopathy disorders.
