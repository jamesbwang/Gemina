 A low protein diet ( LPD<ORGANIZATION> ) with essential amino acid ketoanalogue supplementation ( KA ) may contribute in improving of chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ), while the exact mechanisms of KA<ORGANIZATION> 's effect are not established yet. We have conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled comparative study of LPD<ORGANIZATION> + KA and LPD<ORGANIZATION> alone in relation to serum Klotho<PERSON>, FGF-23 levels in CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients. 79 non-diabetic CKD<ORGANIZATION> 3b-4 stage patients, compliant with LPD<ORGANIZATION> diet ( 0.6 g/kg of body weight/day ), had been selected. The patients were randomized into two groups. The first group ( 42 patients ) received LPD<ORGANIZATION> + КA. The second group ( 37 patients ) continued the LРD<ORGANIZATION> alone. In addition to routine tests, serum Klotho<PERSON>, FGF-23 levels, as well as bioimpedance analysis, sphygmography ( stiffness ( augmentation ) indices ( AI ), central ( aortal ) blood pressure ) with a « SphygmaCor<ORGANIZATION> » device ; echocardiography ( valvular calcification score ( VCS<ORGANIZATION> ) and LVMMI<ORGANIZATION> ), were performed. There were body mass indices ' decrease ( p = 0.046 ), including muscle body mass in men ( p = 0.027 ) and woman ( p = 0.044 ) in the LPD<ORGANIZATION> group to the end of study ( 14th month ). In addition, lower FGF-23 ( p = 0.029 ), and higher sKlotho<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.037 ) were detected in the LPD<ORGANIZATION> + KA group compared to the LPD<ORGANIZATION> one. The increase in AI<GPE> ( p = 0.034 ), VCS<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.048 ), and LVMMI<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.023 ) was detected more often in the LPD<ORGANIZATION> group at the end of study. LPD<ORGANIZATION> + KA provides support for nutrition status and contributes to more efficient correction of FGF-23 and Klotho<GPE> abnormalities that may result in cardiovascular calcification and cardiac remodeling decreasing in CKD<ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, a prolonged LPD<ORGANIZATION> alone may lead to malnutrition.
