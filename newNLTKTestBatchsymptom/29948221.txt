 The interindividual variable response to weight-loss treatments requires the search for new predictive biomarkers for improving the success of weight-loss programs. The aim of this study is to identify novel genes that distinguish individual responses to a weight-loss dietary treatment by using the integrative analysis of mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression and DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation arrays. Subjects from Metabolic Syndrome Reduction<ORGANIZATION> in Navarra<GPE> ( RESMENA<ORGANIZATION> ) project were classified as low ( LR ) or high ( HR ) responders depending on their weight loss. Transcriptomic ( n = 24 ) and epigenomic ( n = 47 ) patterns were determined by array-based genome-wide technologies in human white blood cells at the baseline of the treatment period. CD44<ORGANIZATION> expression was validated by qRT-PCR and methylation degree of CpGs<ORGANIZATION> of the gene was validated by MassARRAY<ORGANIZATION> Different expression and DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation profiles were identified in LR in comparison to HR. The integrative analysis of both array data identified four genes: CD44, ITPR1<ORGANIZATION>, MTSS1<ORGANIZATION> and FBXW5<ORGANIZATION> that were differently methylated and expressed between groups. CD44<ORGANIZATION> showed higher expression and lower DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation levels in LR than in HR. Although differences in CD44<GPE> protein levels between LR<ORGANIZATION> and HR were not statistically significant, a positive association was observed between CD44<ORGANIZATION> mRNA expression and protein levels. In summary, the combination of a genome-wide methylation and expression array dataset can be a useful strategy to identify novel genes that might be considered as predictors of the dietary response. CD44<ORGANIZATION> gene transcription and methylation may be a possible candidate biomarker for weight-loss prediction.
