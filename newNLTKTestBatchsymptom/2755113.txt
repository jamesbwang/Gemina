 Accurate<GPE> detection and classification of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia episodes such as ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) and rapid ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) from electrocardiogram ( ECG<ORGANIZATION> ) is a challenging problem for patient monitoring and defibrillation therapy. This paper introduces a novel method for detection and classification of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia episodes. The ECG<ORGANIZATION> signal is decomposed into various oscillatory modes using digital Taylor-Fourier transform ( DTFT<ORGANIZATION> ). The magnitude feature and a novel phase feature namely the phase difference ( PD ) are evaluated from the mode Taylor-Fourier coefficients of ECG<ORGANIZATION> signal. The least square support vector machine ( LS-SVM ) classifier with linear and radial basis function ( RBF<ORGANIZATION> ) kernels is employed for detection and classification of VT<ORGANIZATION> vs. VF, non-shock vs. shock and VF<ORGANIZATION> vs. non-VF arrhythmia episodes. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values obtained using the proposed method are 89.81, 86.38, and 93.97 %, respectively for the classification of Non-VF and VF<ORGANIZATION> episodes. Comparison<ORGANIZATION> with the performance of the state-of-the-art features demonstrate the advantages of the proposition.
