 Characterization of the cardiac phenotype associated with the novel LMNA<ORGANIZATION> nonsense mutation c.544C > T, p.Q182*, which we have identified in a large five-generation family. A family tree was constructed. Clinical<PERSON> data [ arrhythmia, syncope, sudden cardiac death ( SCD<ORGANIZATION> ), New York<GPE> Heart Association ( NYHA<ORGANIZATION> ) class ] were collected from living and deceased family members. DNA of 23 living family members was analysed for mutations in LMNA<GPE>. Additionally, dilated cardiomyopathy multi-gene-panel testing and whole exome sequencing were performed in some family members to identify potential phenotype-modifiers. In this five-generation family ( n = 65 ), 17 SCDs occurred at 49.3 ± 10.0 years. Furthermore, we identified eight additional mutation-carriers, seven symptomatic ( 44 ± 13 years ), and one asymptomatic ( 44 years ). First signs of disease [ sinus bradycardia with atrioventricular ( AV ) -block I° ] occurred at 36.5 ± 8.1 years. Paroxysmal<ORGANIZATION> atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ( onset at 41.8 ± 5.7 years ) rapidly progressed to permanent AF ( 46.2 ± 9.8 years ). Subsequently, AV-conduction worsened, syncope, pacemaker-dependence, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( 43.3 ± 8.2 years ) followed. Ventricular arrhythmia caused SCD<ORGANIZATION> in patients without implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients protected by ICD<ORGANIZATION> developed rapidly progressive heart failure ( 45.2 ± 10.6 years ). A different phenotype was seen in a sub-family in three patients with early onset of rapidly decompensating heart failure and only minor prior arrhythmia-related symptoms. One patient received high-urgency heart transplantation ( HTX<ORGANIZATION> ) at 32 years, while two died prior to HTX<ORGANIZATION>. One of them developed lethal peripartum-associated heart failure. Possible disease-modifiers were identified in this 'heart failure sub-family '. The novel LMNA<ORGANIZATION> nonsense mutation c.544C > T causes a severe arrhythmogenic phenotype manifesting with high incidence of SCD<ORGANIZATION> in most patients ; and in one sub-family, a distinct phenotype with fast progressing heart failure, indicating the need for early consideration of ICD-implantation and listing for heart-transplantation.
