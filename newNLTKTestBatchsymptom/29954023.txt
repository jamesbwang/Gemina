 A decision tree was constructed to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER<ORGANIZATION> ) of grafting techniques used to prevent Frey Syndrome<PERSON>. The authors performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate what the probability of preventing Frey Syndrome<PERSON> would have to be and maximum costs associated with using grafting techniques to warrant their use as more `` cost-effective '' choice than using neither. Decision pathways utilized were uses of ( 1 ) free fat graft ( FFG<ORGANIZATION> ), ( 2 ) acellular dermis, and ( 3 ) no grafting. The probability of developing Frey<PERSON> syndrome and costs were extracted from previous studies to construct the decision tree. The primary effectiveness was the ICER<ORGANIZATION> of FFG<ORGANIZATION> or acellular dermis to prevent Frey<GPE> syndrome. The initial outcomes included preventing Frey<PERSON> syndrome ( effectiveness = 1 ) or developing Frey<PERSON> syndrome ( effectiveness = 0 ). Compared with not using a graft, the ICER<ORGANIZATION> of using FFG<ORGANIZATION> and acellular dermis were $ 10,628 and $ 50,813, respectively. Frey<PERSON> syndrome was found in 2.6 % of patients postoperatively in FFG<ORGANIZATION> group, 9.8 % of patients in acellular dermis group, and 30.7 % of patients who did not have a graft. The ICER<ORGANIZATION> shows absolute dominance of FFG<ORGANIZATION> with lower cost and high effectiveness over acellular dermis. This economic evaluation strongly supports the use of FFG<ORGANIZATION> over acellular dermis as cost-effective approach for prevention of postparotidectomy Frey<PERSON> syndrome.
