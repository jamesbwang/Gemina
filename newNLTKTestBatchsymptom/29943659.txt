 INTRODUCTION<ORGANIZATION> Frozen sections ( FS ) are routinely employed to assess margin status during partial nephrectomy ( PN ) for clinically localized renal cell carcinoma ( CLRCC<ORGANIZATION> ) ; however, their oncologic benefit remains unclear. There have been no studies investigating the long-term impact of FS<ORGANIZATION> on local or metastatic recurrence. We wished to determine whether the utilization of FS<ORGANIZATION> for this purpose during PN<ORGANIZATION> influenced recurrence rates. MATERIALS AND<ORGANIZATION> METHODS<ORGANIZATION> We performed a retrospective review of 1,090 patients with ( n=172 ) and without ( n=918 ) FS during open and robotic PN between 2006 and 2016 for CLRCC<ORGANIZATION> at a single tertiary care institution. Standard<PERSON> follow-up protocols were employed, with imaging used to guide subsequent biopsy for confirmation. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> and multivariable competing risk regression analysis predicting the association of FS<ORGANIZATION> status and clinicodemographic characteristics with recurrence, with adjustment for all-cause mortality. Administrative data was reviewed to calculate costs of FS<ORGANIZATION>. RESULTS 45/1090 ( 4.13 % ) patients recurred. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of recurrence between patients with and without FS ( Ï‡2=0.001, p=0.97 ). On multivariable competing risk analysis, FS<ORGANIZATION> was not associated with recurrence ( hazard ratio, 1.56 ; 95 % CI, 0.65-3.76 ). However, tumor grade ( g3-4 vs.1-2: hazard ratio, 2.45 ; 95 % CI, 1.16-5.14 ) and stage ( > pT2<ORGANIZATION> vs. pT1a: hazard ratio, 2.86 ; 95 % CI, 1.13-7.26 ) were associated with recurrence. The average direct charge per patient undergoing frozen section was $ 902. CONCLUSIONS<ORGANIZATION> Intraoperative FS for margins during PN did not predict decreased recurrence rates in a single-institution high volume center. Given the lack of associated benefit, and the added cost, the utilization of frozen section during PN should be limited.
