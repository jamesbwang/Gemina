 The purpose of the present study was to assess the long-term success rate of a single 3-min freeze per vein ablation strategy in the setting of pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI<ORGANIZATION> ) by means of second-generation cryoballoon ( CB-A ; Arctic Front Advance<ORGANIZATION>, Medtronic<PERSON>, Minneapolis<GSP>, MN<ORGANIZATION>, USA<ORGANIZATION> ) in a large cohort of patients. Three hundred and one patients with drug resistant atrial fibrillation ( AF ) having undergone PVI by means of CB-A using a single 3-min freeze per vein ablation strategy were included in the analysis. Paroxysmal AF<PERSON> ( PAF<ORGANIZATION> ) was documented in 70.8 % of the patients, while 29.2 % presented with persistent AF ( PersAF<ORGANIZATION> ). The mean number of CB<ORGANIZATION> applications was 1.09 ± 0.3 in the left superior pulmonary vein ( LSPV<ORGANIZATION> ), 1.04 ± 0.2 in the left inferior pulmonary vein ( LIPV<ORGANIZATION> ), 1.12 ± 0.3 in the right superior pulmonary vein ( RSPV<ORGANIZATION> ), and 1.12 ± 0.3 in the right inferior pulmonary vein ( RIPV<ORGANIZATION> ). All PVs were successfully isolated with a 28-mm CB-A only. After a mean follow-up of 38.1 ± 7.5 months, 207 ( 68.8 % ) patients were free of atrial tachyarrhythmia ( ATa<ORGANIZATION> ) recurrences following a single procedure. Specifically, 72.8 % of patients presenting with PAF<ORGANIZATION> and 59.1 % of individuals with PersAF<ORGANIZATION> did not experience a recurrence. A single 3-min freeze per vein strategy is effective in treating AF on a long term follow-up of 38 months. Specifically, it can afford freedom from ATa<ORGANIZATION> recurrences in 72.8 % of patients affected by PAF<ORGANIZATION> and 59.1 % of patients initially presenting with PersAF<ORGANIZATION> after a single CB-A procedure.
