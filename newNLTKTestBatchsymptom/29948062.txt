 Impairments in quality of life ( QoL<ORGANIZATION> ) have been reported in patients with fibrous dysplasia ( FD ). Here, we examine coping strategies in FD and assess whether these coping strategies are associated with QoL<ORGANIZATION> and disease severity. Ninety-two patients ( 66 % females ) filled out the Utrecht<ORGANIZATION> Coping List ( UCL<ORGANIZATION> ), Short Form-36<PERSON>, and the Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI<ORGANIZATION> ). Coping strategies of patients with FD<ORGANIZATION> were compared with reference data from a random sample of Dutch<GPE> women and patients with chronic pain. Compared to healthy adults, patients expressed more emotions ( p < 0.01 ). Compared to patients with chronic pain, patients with FD<ORGANIZATION> used more active coping strategies ( p < 0.001 ), and sought more distraction ( p = 0.01 ) and more social support ( p < 0.001 ). Using more passive coping strategies was associated with more impairment in social function, physical role, mental health, vitality ( all p < 0.001 ), and general health ( p < 0.01 ). Using more avoidant coping strategies was associated with worse mental health and less vitality ( both p < 0.01 ). More expression of emotions was associated with worse mental health ( p < 0.01 ). Type<PERSON> and clinical severity of FD were not associated with coping behavior. Patients with FD have different coping strategies compared to random Dutch<GPE> reference populations with or without pain. In FD<GPE>, using more passive coping strategies was associated with more impairment in several aspects of QoL<ORGANIZATION>. There was no relationship between coping behavior and clinical characteristics, pointing to biomedical variables not determining the way patients cope with their illness. Recognition of less effective coping strategies can be helpful in the understanding and adaptation of these coping strategies, improving personalized clinical care, with the ultimate goal to improve QoL<ORGANIZATION> in patients with FD<ORGANIZATION>.
