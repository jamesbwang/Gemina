 Cesarean<GPE> section scar diverticulum ( CSD<ORGANIZATION> ) lead to many long-term complications. CSD<ORGANIZATION> is more prevalent in patients with a retroflexed uterus than in those with an anteflexed uterus. To estimate the association between flexion of the uterus and the outcome of treatment for a cesarean section scar diverticulum ( CSD<ORGANIZATION> ) treated by vaginal repair. Retrospective cohort study ( Canadian<GPE> Task Force<ORGANIZATION> classification II-2 ). University<ORGANIZATION> hospital. A total of 241 women with a CSD<ORGANIZATION> were enrolled at the Shanghai<ORGANIZATION> First Maternity & Infant Hospital<ORGANIZATION> between May 2014 and Oct 2016. Vaginal excision and suture of CSD<ORGANIZATION>. A high failure rate was reported in remodelling of the scar by other surgeries in women with retroflexed uteri. Clinical<PERSON> information was obtained from medical records. Since intermenstrual bleeding was a presenting symptom of CSD<ORGANIZATION>, duration of menstruation was compared between groups. They were required to be followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to record their menstruation situation and measure the CSD<ORGANIZATION>. The thickness of the residual myometrium ( TRM<ORGANIZATION> ) in the retroflexion group was much thinner than that in the anteflexion group before treatment ( 2.5 ± 1.2 mm vs 2.9 ± 1.1 mm, P<PERSON> < .05 ). There was no statistical difference in pretreatment menstruation duration between groups ( P<PERSON> > .05 ). The duration of menstruation in the anteflexion group was 8.2 ± 2.1 days and 8.5 ± 2.1 days, and the duration of menstruation in the retroflexion group was 7.6 ± 2.0 days and 7.7 ± 3.1 days at 3 and 6 months after surgery ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). Meanwhile, in all 58.6 % ( 140/239 ) of the patients who had a retroflexed uterus, 60.0 % ( 84/140 ) of these patients reached ≤ 7 days of menstruation at 6 months after surgery ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). Though about 40 % patients still had CSD<ORGANIZATION> after repair, menstruation duration and TRM<ORGANIZATION> were improved significantly ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). We propose that vaginal repair can relieve symptoms and improved TRM<ORGANIZATION> for CSD<ORGANIZATION> patients, especially for those who have a retroflexed uterus, though 40 % of patients still had a defect post-operatively.
