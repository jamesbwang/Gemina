 Caregiving spouses of individuals with chronic pain often experience poor well-being. The current study aimed to examine the association between chronic pain-related provision of autonomy support and well-being in support providers ( spouses ) of individuals with chronic pain. Spouses of individuals with a diagnosed musculoskeletal chronic pain condition ( N = 172 ) were recruited for a five-time point longitudinal study. Participants<PERSON> completed the questionnaires once every 6 months across 2 years. In a follow-up diary study, participants ( N = 41 ) completed daily records of provision of autonomy support and well-being. Multilevel<PERSON> analyses showed that provision of autonomy support was associated with greater well-being in support providers at both within-person and between-person levels. Longitudinal cross-lagged analyses also provided some evidence that it is provision of autonomy support that predicts well-being, and not the opposite. These effects held true in the follow-up diary study ; however, some findings also suggested that the short-term associations between provision of autonomy support and well-being could be reciprocal. Current findings extend the existing literature by suggesting provision of autonomy support as a beneficial type of support for the provider within the chronic pain context and lay the groundwork for caregiver-focused interventions.
