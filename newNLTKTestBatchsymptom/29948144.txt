 Pediatric<GPE> experience with biliary tract injuries ( BTI<ORGANIZATION> ) is limited and mostly consists of case presentations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical and radiological findings of possible BTI<ORGANIZATION>, treatment strategies, and results. The records of nine patients with the diagnosis of BTI<ORGANIZATION> between July 2009 and November 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. There were seven boys and two girls ( mean 8.05 Â± 4.39 years ). The mechanisms were motor vehicle occupant, fall, crush and gunshot wound. Hepatic<PERSON> laceration routes that extended into the porta hepatis and contracted the gall bladder were demonstrated on computerized tomography ( CT ). Bile<PERSON> duct injury was diagnosed with bile leakage from the thoracic tube ( n = 2 ), from the abdominal drain ( n = 2 ) and by paracentesis ( n = 5 ). Extrahepatic ( n = 8 ) and intrahepatic ( n = 1 ) bile duct injuries were diagnosed by cholangiography. Endoscopic<PERSON> retrograde cholangiography, sphincterotomy, and stent placement were successfully completed in five patients. Peritoneal<PERSON> drainage stopped after 3-17 days of procedure in four patients. The fifth patient was operated with the diagnosis of cystic duct avulsion. Cholecystectomies, primary repair of laceration, cystic duct ligation, and Roux-en-Y hepatoportoenterostomy were performed in the remaining four patients. All patients presented with clinically normal findings, normal liver functions, and normal ultrasonographic findings in the follow-up period. The presentation of the parenchymal injury extending to the porta hepatis with contracted gall bladder on CT and diffuse homogenous abdominal fluid should be considered as signs of BTI<ORGANIZATION>. We suggest a multi-disciplinary approach for the diagnosis and treatment of BTIs<ORGANIZATION>. Surgery may be indicated according to the patient 's clinical condition, radiological findings and failure of non-operative treatment.
