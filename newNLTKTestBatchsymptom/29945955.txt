 Children<GPE> born extremely preterm are at risk for cognitive difficulties and disability. The relative prognostic value of neonatal brain MRI<ORGANIZATION> and cranial ultrasound ( CUS<ORGANIZATION> ) for school-age outcomes remains unclear. Our objectives were to relate near-term conventional brain MRI<ORGANIZATION> and early and late CUS<ORGANIZATION> to cognitive impairment and disability at 6 to 7 years among children born extremely preterm and assess prognostic value. A prospective study of adverse early and late CUS<ORGANIZATION> and near-term conventional MRI<ORGANIZATION> findings to predict outcomes at 6 to 7 years including a full-scale IQ ( FSIQ<ORGANIZATION> ) < 70 and disability ( FSIQ<ORGANIZATION> < 70, moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, or severe vision or hearing impairment ) in a subgroup of Surfactant Positive Airway<ORGANIZATION> Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial<PERSON> enrollees. Stepwise<PERSON> logistic regression evaluated associations of neuroimaging with outcomes, adjusting for perinatal-neonatal factors. A total of 386 children had follow-up. In unadjusted analyses, severity of white matter abnormality and cerebellar lesions on MRI<ORGANIZATION> and adverse CUS<ORGANIZATION> findings were associated with outcomes. In full regression models, both adverse late CUS<ORGANIZATION> findings ( odds ratio [ OR ] 27.9 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 6.0-129 ) and significant cerebellar lesions on MRI<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 2.71 ; 95 % CI 1.1-6.7 ) remained associated with disability, but only adverse late CUS<ORGANIZATION> findings ( OR 20.1 ; 95 % CI 3.6-111 ) were associated with FSIQ<ORGANIZATION> < 70. Predictive accuracy of stepwise models was not substantially improved with the addition of neuroimaging. Severe but rare adverse late CUS<ORGANIZATION> findings were most strongly associated with cognitive impairment and disability at school age, and significant cerebellar lesions on MRI<ORGANIZATION> were associated with disability. Near-term conventional MRI<ORGANIZATION> did not substantively enhance prediction of severe early school-age outcomes.
