 The Forty patients with schizophrenia were treated with aripiprazole for 6 weeks. We measured Positive<PERSON> and Negative Syndrome Scale<PERSON> ( PANSS<ORGANIZATION> ) and plasma levels of homovanillic acid ( HVA<ORGANIZATION> ) and plasma MHPG<ORGANIZATION> ( 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol ) at baseline and endpoint. The There were significant genotype-time interactions on PANSS<ORGANIZATION> total and general psychopathology scores, with Met/Met<ORGANIZATION> genotype showing greater improvement. The response rate to aripiprazole did not differ between Our results suggest that individuals with the Met/Met<ORGANIZATION> genotype had greater improvement in PANSS<GPE> score after the treatment with aripiprazole. On the other hand, the Val 108/158 Met<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism may not induce changes in plasma levels of monoamine metabolites during aripiprazole treatment. Because of the small sample size, further studies are needed to confirm and to extend our results.
