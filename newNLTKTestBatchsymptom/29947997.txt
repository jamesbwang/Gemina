 The determination of excess of body fat mass provides a more suitable determinant of obesity in rheumatoid arthritis patients ; however, body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ) may not be accurate for the quantification of adiposity. To identify a marker of excess adiposity in women with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) using different methods for fat mass evaluation. A cross-sectional study was conducted in adult female patients with RA<ORGANIZATION>. Disease<PERSON> activity was assessed by DAS28-ESR, and obesity was determined by waist circumference ( WC ), BMI<ORGANIZATION> and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA<ORGANIZATION> ). The Human Bone Metabolism<ORGANIZATION> kit ( Merck Millipore<ORGANIZATION>, Darmstadt<PERSON>, Alemanha<PERSON> ) was used to determine the plasma levels of leptin, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β by quantification of serum proteins by technical microspheres ( LUMINEX<ORGANIZATION>, TX<ORGANIZATION>, USA<ORGANIZATION> ). Adiponectin<PERSON> was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay sandwich kit ( R<ORGANIZATION> & D Systems<ORGANIZATION>, Minneapolis<GSP>, MN<ORGANIZATION>, USA<ORGANIZATION> ). Eighty-nine female patients, median age of 55.4 ( ± 11.6 ) years, and median disease duration of 16.4 ( ± 14.9 ) years were included. The frequency of obesity was 33.7 % according to BMI<ORGANIZATION>, 89.9 % with WC<ORGANIZATION>, and 56.1 % with DXA<ORGANIZATION>. The median serum leptin concentration was the only marker that correlated with body fat percentage according to the three methods. This correlation was positive and not influenced by DAS28<ORGANIZATION>, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or inflammatory cytokines levels ( IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β ). Analysis of ROC<ORGANIZATION> curves determined the cut-off point of 10.3 ng/mL of leptin as an obesity marker, with a sensitivity of 96.43 % and a specificity of 23.81 %. Serum<PERSON> leptin correlates positively with fat mass and is potentially useful in excess fat mass determination in clinical practice.
