 Pancreatic<GPE> lipidosis ( nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease, NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> ) causes insulin resistance and dysfunction of pancreatic Î²-cells, with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM<ORGANIZATION> ). However, the prevalence and pathogenic factors associated with NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> are not clear. The aim of the study was to explore the prevalence of NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> in a Chinese<GPE> adult population, and investigate factors associated with NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> aggravation.This was a cross-sectional study ; 4419 subjects were enrolled for NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> screening and were divided into NAFPD<GPE> ( n = 488 ) and without NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 3930 ) groups. The sex, age, related concomitant diseases, general physical parameters, and serum glucose and lipid metabolism were compared between the 2 groups.The overall NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> prevalence was 11.05 %, but increased with age. In those < 55 years NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> prevalence was lower in females than males ( P<PERSON> < .05 ), but prevalence was similar > 55 years. Nonalcoholic<PERSON> fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ), T2DM<ORGANIZATION>, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index, total cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoprotein, adiponectin, and glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) were the independent risk factors for NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). Analaysis of mild NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> ( MN ) and severe NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> ( SN ) subgroups, according to the extent of fat deposition, suggested that NAFLD<ORGANIZATION>, triglyceride, lipoprotein, and adiponectin were independent risk factors for NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> aggravation ( P<PERSON> < .05 ) .The NAFPD<ORGANIZATION> prevalence was about 11 % in Chinese<GPE> adults. Its development and progression was related to NAFLD<ORGANIZATION>, T2DM<ORGANIZATION>, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and GLP-1 levels. Severe NAFPD<PERSON> was associated with NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> and dyslipidemia.
