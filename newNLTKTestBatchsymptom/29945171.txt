 The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional value of Glutenol<GPE>, a new coproduct of the ethanol industry. Glutenol<PERSON> was produced by Quality Technology International<ORGANIZATION>, Elgin<PERSON>, IL<ORGANIZATION>, in a modified wet-milling plant using a hybrid process, NextGenFrac<ORGANIZATION>, which fractionates the corn kernel components prior to fermentation without the use of sulfur dioxide. Glutenol<PERSON> was analyzed to contain 52.3 % CP, 1.7 % Met<ORGANIZATION> + Cys, 1.32 % Lys<PERSON>, 1.69 % Thr, and 2.23 % Val<PERSON> on a DM basis. Two precision-fed rooster assays with conventional and cecectomized roosters were conducted to determine TMEn<ORGANIZATION> and standardized digestibility of amino acids ( AA ), respectively. The TMEn<ORGANIZATION> of Glutenol<PERSON> was determined to be 3,256 kcal/kg DM. Standardized digestibility values for Lys<PERSON>, Met<ORGANIZATION>, Cys<PERSON>, Thr<PERSON>, and Val<PERSON> were 80.1 %, 90.4 %, 80.1 %, 74.1 %, 81.1 %, and 84.9 %, respectively. In addition, a 3-wk broiler chick assay was conducted with increasing levels of dietary Glutenol. Diet 1 was a standard corn/soybean meal diet with 0 % Glutenol. Diets 2, 3, and 4 had increasing levels of Glutenol<GPE> at 4 %, 8 %, and 12 %, respectively. Diets were fed from 3 to 22 d post-hatch and all diets were formulated to be equal in TMEn<ORGANIZATION> and digestible AA. Weight<PERSON> gain, feed intake, and gain/feed ratio were measured. No differences in growth performance were observed among dietary treatments. In conclusion, Glutenol<PERSON> can be fed up to at least 12 % in the diet of broiler chickens if diets are formulated to be equal in ME and digestible AA.
