 Social<GPE> delphinids employ a vocal repertoire of clicks for echolocation and whistles for communication. Conversely, the less social and acoustically cryptic harbour porpoises ( Phocoena<ORGANIZATION> phocoena ) only produce narrow-band high-frequency ( NBHF<ORGANIZATION> ) clicks with properties that appear poorly suited for communication. Nevertheless, these small odontocetes likely mediate social interactions, such as mate choice and mother-calf contact, with sound. Here, we deployed six tags ( DTAG3<ORGANIZATION> ) on wild porpoises in Danish<GPE> waters for a total of 96 hours to investigate if the patterns and use of stereotyped NBHF<ORGANIZATION> click trains are consistent with a communication function. We show that wild porpoises produce frequent ( up to 27 â€¢ min
