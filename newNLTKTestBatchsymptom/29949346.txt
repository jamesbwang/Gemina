 Naturally occurring mutations found in one of the two Ω-loop substructures in human cytochrome c are associated with low blood platelet count ( thrombocytopenia ). Both Ω-loops participate in the formation of conformers associated with cytochrome c peroxidase activity and apoptotic function. At alkaline pH values the Met80<ORGANIZATION> ligand to the ferric heme iron dissociates and a lysine residue in the 71-85 Ω-loop coordinates to the iron. The alkaline isomerisation has been the focus of extensive kinetic studies and it is established that a deprotonation triggers the release of the Met80<ORGANIZATION> ligand ( pK<ORGANIZATION>
