 Understanding the pathomechanics of a bicruciate injury ( BI ) is critical for its correct diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this biomechanical study aims to quantify the effects of sequential sectioning of the anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL<ORGANIZATION> ) and posterior cruciate ligament ( PCL<ORGANIZATION> ) bundles on knee laxity. Twelve<PERSON> cadaveric knees ( six matched pairs ) were used. Knee<PERSON> laxity measurements consisted of neutral tibial position, anterior-posterior translation, internal-external rotation, and varus-valgus angulation in different conditions: intact, ACL<ORGANIZATION> cut, incomplete BI ( divided into two groups: anterolateral ( AL<ORGANIZATION> ) bundle intact or posteromedial ( PM ) bundle intact ) and complete bicruciate tear. Data were collected using a Microscribe<GPE> system at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion. In comparison to the intact knees, incomplete BI and complete BI showed a significant increase of total antero-posterior tibial translation. The largest significant increase was observed at 90° of flexion after a complete bicruciate resection ( p < 0.001 ). A threshold difference greater than 15 mm from the intact could be used to identify a complete BI from an incomplete BI evaluating the total antero-posterior translation at 90°. All sectioned states had significant increases compared with the intact condition in internal-external rotation and varus-valgus stability at all tested flexion angles. Both incomplete and complete BI led to an important AP<ORGANIZATION> translation instability at all angles ; however, full extension was the most stable position at all injured models. Total antero-posterior translation at 90° of knee flexion over 15 mm, in comparison to the intact condition, was indicative of a complete BI. Since the appropriate assessment of a combined ACL<ORGANIZATION> and PCL<ORGANIZATION> lesion remains a challenge, this study intends to assist its diagnosis. As BI<ORGANIZATION> 's main antero-posterior instability occurred at 90°, a total antero-posterior drawer test is proposed to evaluate BI in the clinical setting. Total antero-posterior translation at 90° > 15 mm, in comparison to the intact condition or the contra-lateral non-injured knee, can be used to identify a complete from an incomplete BI.
