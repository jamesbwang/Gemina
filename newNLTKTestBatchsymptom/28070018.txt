 Recent studies suggest curcumin is a promising nutraceutical for improving important clinical and physiological markers of healthy aging, including motor and cognitive function. To determine if curcumin supplementation improves motor and cognitive function in healthy middle-aged and older adults. 39 healthy men and postmenopausal women ( 45-74 yrs ) were randomized to 12 weeks of placebo ( Using measures of the NIH Toolbox<ORGANIZATION> and other standardized tests, there were no changes in muscle strength and rate of torque development, dexterity, fatigability, mobility, endurance, and balance between the placebo and curcumin groups after 12 weeks ( all Overall, 12 weeks of curcumin supplementation does not improve motor and cognitive functions in healthy middle-aged and older adults. It is possible that curcumin may enhance these functions in groups with greater baseline impairments than those studied here, including adults greater than 75 years of age and/or patients with clinical disorders.
