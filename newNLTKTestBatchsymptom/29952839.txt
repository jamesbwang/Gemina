 To analyze the effectiveness of enhanced external counterpulsation ( EECP<ORGANIZATION> ) on recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage ( EIMD<ORGANIZATION> ). This study followed a crossover, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced design. Ten healthy active subjects ( 7 male ; 27 Â± 4 years ). Participants<PERSON> performed a plyometric exercise bout ( 10 sets of 10 jumps interspersed with 1-minute rests ) and were then assigned to recover for 30 minutes with either EECP ( cuff pressure = 80 mm Hg ) or a Sham<GPE> intervention ( 0 mm Hg ) immediately after exercise and at 24 hours after exercise. Two weeks later, they repeated the protocol with the other recovery intervention. Muscle<PERSON> soreness, creatine kinase ( CK ) activity, jump performance, and tensiomyographic variables were measured before exercise, and 24 and 48 hours after exercise. The mean jump height of the plyometric bout did not differ between EECP<ORGANIZATION> and Sham<GPE> ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). Exercise<PERSON> resulted in increased muscle soreness ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) and CK<ORGANIZATION> levels ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), as well as in impaired jump performance ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). No changes were observed in tensiomyographic variables. No significant differences were found between interventions for any of the study outcomes. No benefits on recovery from EIMD<ORGANIZATION> after a plyometric exercise bout were observed with EECP<ORGANIZATION>.
