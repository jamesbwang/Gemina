 ERBB<GPE> family cell surface receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR/ERBB1 ), are phosphorylated upon binding by various EGF<ORGANIZATION> family ligands and signal via multiple kinase pathways. EGFR<ORGANIZATION> signaling is enhanced due to mutational activation of EGFR<ORGANIZATION> in almost half of glioblastomas, the most common malignant primary brain tumor. Therapeutic targeting of EGFR<ORGANIZATION> in glioblastoma has remained largely unsuccessful. Here we profiled 9 long-term ( LTC<ORGANIZATION> ) and 5 glioma-initiating ( GIC<ORGANIZATION> ) cell lines for expression and activation of ERBB<ORGANIZATION> family receptors and expression of their ligands. Receptors and ligands were abundantly expressed, with patterns overall similar to glioblastoma expression profiles in vivo as deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas<ORGANIZATION> ( TCGA<ORGANIZATION> ) database. No differences between LTC<ORGANIZATION> and GIC<ORGANIZATION> emerged. Irrespective of ligand or receptor expression, neither an EGFR<ORGANIZATION> antibody, erbitux, nor an EGFR<ORGANIZATION> tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI<ORGANIZATION> ), gefitinib, were particularly active against LTC<ORGANIZATION> or GIC<ORGANIZATION> at clinically relevant concentrations. Self-renewal capacity of GIC<ORGANIZATION> was severely compromised by EGF<ORGANIZATION> withdrawal, but rescued by transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF- Î± ), although not by neuregulin-1 ( NRG-1 ). Subcellular fractionation indicated high levels of nuclear phosphorylated EGFR<ORGANIZATION> in all LTC and GIC<ORGANIZATION>. In LN-229 cells, pERBB2<ORGANIZATION> and pERBB3<ORGANIZATION> were also detected in the nucleus. Nuclear<PERSON> pERBB2<ORGANIZATION> was less sensitive, whereas pERBB3<ORGANIZATION> was induced, in response to gefitinib. This study provides an extensive characterization of human glioma cell models, including stem-like models, with regard to ERBB<ORGANIZATION> receptor/ligand expression and signaling. Redundant signaling involving multiple ERBB<ORGANIZATION> family ligands and receptors may contribute to the challenges of developing more effective EGFR-targeted therapies for glioblastoma.
