 Presently, biomechanical support therapy for the femoral head has become an important approach in the treatment of early osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH<ORGANIZATION> ). Previous studies have reported that the titanium metal trabecular bone reconstruction systems ( TMTBRS<ORGANIZATION> ) achieved satisfactory clinical results for the treatment of early femoral head necrosis. Electron<PERSON> beam melting technology ( EBMT<ORGANIZATION> ) is an important branch of 3D printing technology, which enables the construction of an interface that is required for support of bone in-growth. However, the effect of TMTBRS<ORGANIZATION> created using EBMT<ORGANIZATION> for clinical applications for early ONFH<ORGANIZATION> is still unknown. At present, there are no reports on this topic worldwide. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of a new 3D printed TMTBRS<ORGANIZATION> implant and to evaluate its clinical efficacy in early ONFH.Thirty patients who underwent surgery for ONFH<ORGANIZATION> were selected. The stages of ONFH<ORGANIZATION> were classified according to the Association Research Circulation Osseus<ORGANIZATION> ( ARCO<ORGANIZATION> ) classification. They were followed-up and radiological examination was performed at 6, 12, and 24 months post-surgery to assess TMTBRS<ORGANIZATION> stability and bone growth in the bone trabecular holder portion surface. To evaluate hip function, postoperative Harris<PERSON> and Visual Analogue Scale<PERSON> ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> ) scores were used.The postoperative Harris<GPE> score increased significantly and VAS<ORGANIZATION> score decreased significantly at the 12-month follow-up compared to the 24-month follow-up, wherein the Harris<GPE> score declined slightly and the VAS<ORGANIZATION> score was slightly elevated with the aggravation of ONFH<ORGANIZATION>. With the passage of time, postoperative improvement rates were 100 % for IIA<ORGANIZATION>, 70 % for IIB<ORGANIZATION>, and 0 % for IIC<ORGANIZATION>. Hip-preserving rates were 100 % for IIA<ORGANIZATION>, 100 % for IIB<ORGANIZATION>, and 50 % for IIC.The effect of TMTBRS<ORGANIZATION> treatment for early ONFH in ARCO<ORGANIZATION> IIA and ARCO<ORGANIZATION> IIB is satisfactory. However, it is not recommended for a relatively large area of necrosis such as in ARCO<ORGANIZATION> IIC.
