 Adenosine<GPE> triphosphate ( ATP<ORGANIZATION> ) provides energy for the regulation of multiple cellular processes in living organisms. Capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of ATP<ORGANIZATION> in single cells is fundamental to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying cellular energy metabolism. However, it has remained challenging to visualize the dynamics of ATP<ORGANIZATION> in and between distinct intracellular organelles and its interplay with other signaling molecules. Using single fluorescent proteins, we developed a multicolor ATP<ORGANIZATION> indicator system, enabling the simultaneous visualization of subcellular ATP<ORGANIZATION> dynamics in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of cells derived from a wide variety of species, including mammalian cells, plants, and worms. Furthermore, in combination with additional fluorescent indicators, we were able to visualize the dynamic interplay of ATP<ORGANIZATION>, cAMP<ORGANIZATION>, and Ca2+ in the activated brown adipocyte, a cell specialized for uncoupled respiration. This set of indicator tools will facilitate future research into energy metabolism.
