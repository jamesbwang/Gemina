 Pleomorphic<GPE> lobular carcinoma in situ ( PLCIS<ORGANIZATION> ) is an uncommon high-grade in situ lesion that shares morphologic features of both classic lobular and ductal carcinoma in situ. Data on the natural history of pure PLCIS are limited, and no evidence-based consensus guidelines for management exist. From our prospectively maintained institutional pathology and breast surgery databases, we identified all patients with a diagnosis of PLCIS<ORGANIZATION> on core needle biopsy ( CNB<ORGANIZATION> ) or excisional biopsy from 2004 to 2017. Patient<PERSON>, tumor, treatment, and outcome data were abstracted to analyze upstage rates and treatment outcomes. We identified 18 patients with pure PLCIS: 15 diagnosed on CNB<ORGANIZATION>, 2 diagnosed at operation for atypia on CNB<ORGANIZATION>, and 1 diagnosed after excisional biopsy without preceding CNB<ORGANIZATION>. Of the 15 patients with PLCIS<ORGANIZATION> on CNB<ORGANIZATION>, 3 ( 20 % ) were upgraded to invasive cancer on surgical excision. Overall, 7 patients were treated with mastectomy ( all margin-negative ) and 11 with lumpectomy ( one with a focally positive margin ). Eight patients received adjuvant therapy: six endocrine therapy, one radiation therapy, and one received both. Among patients with a final diagnosis of PLCIS<ORGANIZATION>, two ipsilateral recurrences were observed at follow-up: one invasive lobular carcinoma at 87 months and one PLCIS at 16 months postoperatively. PLCIS on CNB<ORGANIZATION> mandates surgical resection as 20 % of patients may be upgraded to invasive cancer, and outcomes following pathologic margin-negative surgical resection were excellent with only one invasive recurrence observed. Larger-scale investigation with longer follow-up is needed to define a role for adjuvant therapy and to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.
