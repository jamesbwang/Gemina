 Neoadjuvant<GPE> chemotherapy is increasingly used in borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer to facilitate surgical resection. To compare progression free survival and overall survival in patients receiving neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION> with those receiving gemcitabine/abraxane. Retrospective cohort study. University<ORGANIZATION> of Colorado Hospital<ORGANIZATION> from 2012-2016. Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION> or gemcitabine/abraxane. Perioperative outcomes, progression free survival, and overall survival were compared between groups. A multivariate Cox<PERSON> proportional hazard model was applied to evaluate survival outcomes. We identified 120 patients: 83 ( 69.2 % ) FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION> and 37 ( 30.8 % ) gemcitabine/abraxane. The FOLIFRINOX<ORGANIZATION> group was younger and had a lower ECOG<ORGANIZATION> performance status ( p < 0.05 ). Patients in the FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION> group were more likely to undergo surgical resection compared to gemcitabine/abraxane ( 66.3 % Neoadjuvant<ORGANIZATION> FOLFIRINOX may improve progression free survival by increasing the proportion of patients undergoing surgical resection. Improved understanding of the role for selection bias and longer follow up are needed to better define the impact of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX<ORGANIZATION> on overall survival.
