 The compositional evolution of the network structure and connectivity in binary SnO-P2O5 glasses with 35≤ mol % SnO<ORGANIZATION> ≤55 is studied using two-dimensional 119Sn and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR<ORGANIZATION> ) spectroscopy. The phosphate Qn species concentrations, as obtained from the analyses of the 31P NMR spectral line shapes suggest that the network modification can be described in terms of a binary Q-speciation model. On the other hand, the 119Sn NMR spectra suggest that the Sn-O coordination environment in these glasses is composition dependent. Sn is present in both threefold ( trigonal pyramid ) and fourfold ( trigonal bipyramid ) coordination with oxygen in these glasses. The relative fraction of the trigonal pyramidal environment increases with increasing SnO<ORGANIZATION> content. The unusually low glass transition temperature Tg of these glasses ( 241-266 ºC ) is argued to be related to the low coordination number of Sn<GPE>, leading to a relatively sparsely connected structural network.
