 To assess and compare the efficacy of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs<ORGANIZATION> ), namely diclofenac and ketorolac, for pain control after photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK<ORGANIZATION> ). In this double-masked clinical study, 60 patients treated bilaterally with PRK<ORGANIZATION> were randomly allocated into two groups. Postoperatively, one group of patients received diclofenac 0.1 % drops and the other group was prescribed ketorolac 0.5 % ophthalmic drops in both eyes every 6 hr on the first day and then, no NSAID was applied until the third day. No oral analgesic drug was used after surgery. Patients<PERSON> completed the Visual Analog Scale<ORGANIZATION> questionnaire to determine the degree of pain and ocular discomfort ( tearing, foreign body sensation, blurred vision, and photophobia ) on the first and the third day after surgery. Pain<PERSON> relief was achieved with both medications after surgery, and there was no significant intergroup difference in the level of pain reduction at 24 and 72 hr postoperatively ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). The ketorolac group experienced less tearing and photophobia only at 24 hr postoperatively ( P=0.01 ), and by 72 hr after surgery, the results were similar in two groups ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). There was no significant intergroup difference in terms of foreign body sensation or blurred vision on the first or third postoperative days ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). Both diclofenac and ketorolac are effective in reducing pain and ocular discomfort after PRK<ORGANIZATION>, and ketorolac may have greater control on tearing and photophobia during the first 24 postoperative hours.
