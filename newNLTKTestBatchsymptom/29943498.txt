 To estimate the patient-specific risk of pre-eclampsia ( PE ) at 19-24 weeks ' gestation by maternal factors and combinations of mean arterial pressure ( MAP<ORGANIZATION> ), uterine artery pulsatility index ( UtA-PI ), serum placental growth factor ( PlGF<ORGANIZATION> ) and serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 ( sFlt-1 ). On the basis of the risk of PE<ORGANIZATION>, the women would be stratified into high-, intermediate- and low-risk management groups. The high-risk group would require close monitoring for high blood pressure and proteinuria at 24-31 weeks. The intermediate-risk group, together with the undelivered pregnancies from the high-risk group, would have reassessment of risk for PE at 32 weeks to identify those who would require close monitoring for high blood pressure and proteinuria at 32-35 weeks. All pregnancies would have reassessment of risk for PE at 36 weeks to define the plan for further monitoring and delivery. This was a prospective observational study of women attending for an ultrasound scan at 19-24 weeks as part of routine pregnancy care. Patient-specific risks of delivery with PE<ORGANIZATION> at < 32 and at < 36 weeks ' gestation were calculated using the competing-risks model to combine the prior distribution of gestational age at delivery with PE<ORGANIZATION>, obtained from maternal characteristics and medical history, with multiples of the median ( MoM<ORGANIZATION> ) values of MAP<ORGANIZATION>, UtA-PI, PlGF<ORGANIZATION> and sFlt-1. Different risk cut-offs were used to vary the proportion of the population stratified into high-, intermediate- and low-risk groups, and the performance of screening for delivery with PE<ORGANIZATION> at < 32 weeks ' gestation and at 32 + 0 to 35 + 6 weeks was estimated. The study population of 16 254 singleton pregnancies included 467 ( 2.9 % ) that subsequently developed PE ( 23 delivered at < 32 weeks, 58 delivered at 32 + 0 to 35 + 6 weeks and 386 delivered at ≥ 36 weeks ). Using a risk of > 1 in 25 for PE at < 32 weeks ' gestation and risk of > 1 in 150 for PE at < 36 weeks, the proportion of the population stratified into the high-risk group was about 1 % of the total, and the proportion of cases of PE at < 32 weeks ' gestation contained within this high-risk group varied from about 35 % with screening by maternal factors and MAP<ORGANIZATION>, to 78 % with maternal factors, MAP<ORGANIZATION> and UtA-PI, and up to 100 % with maternal factors, MAP<ORGANIZATION>, UtA-PI and PlGF<ORGANIZATION>, with or without sFlt-1. Similarly, the proportion of the population requiring reassessment of risk at 32 weeks ' gestation and the proportion of cases of PE at 32 + 0 to 35 + 6 weeks contained within this population varied, respectively, from about 18 % and 79 % with screening by maternal factors and MAP<ORGANIZATION>, to 10 % and 90 % with maternal factors, MAP<ORGANIZATION>, UtA-PI and PlGF<ORGANIZATION>, with or without sFlt-1. In the new pyramid of pregnancy care, assessment of risk for PE at 19-24 weeks ' gestation can stratify the population into those requiring intensive monitoring at 24-31 weeks and those in need of reassessment at 32 weeks.
