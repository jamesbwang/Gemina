 Although intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH<ORGANIZATION> ) is more common among African-Americans, data on the burden of cerebral microbleeds ( CMBs<ORGANIZATION> ) among different races is limited. The purpose of this study is to compare the number, associated factors, and topography of CMBs<ORGANIZATION> between African-American and Caucasian<GPE> populations in the Mid-South United States<GPE>. Using natural language processing, we extracted all brain MRIs<ORGANIZATION> performed during a 2-year period ( 2012-2013 ) when the report indicated the presence of CMB<ORGANIZATION>. All the extracted MRI<ORGANIZATION> studies were evaluated for number and location of CMBs<ORGANIZATION>, prior stroke, and deep white matter lesion. Negative binomial regression was used to model for the overdispersed count data. A total 167 patients ( mean age was 63 ± 15 years, 49 % men, 77 % African-American, median CMB<ORGANIZATION> count: 8 ) with 1 or more CMBs on their brain MRI<ORGANIZATION> were included in this study. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of CMB<ORGANIZATION> locations ( P<PERSON> = .086 ), but there was a significant difference between African-American and Caucasian<GPE> patients in terms of number of CMBs<ORGANIZATION> ( 16.5 ± 18 versus 6.5 ± 5.5, P<PERSON> < .001 ). The prevalence of multiple CMBs<ORGANIZATION> ( CMBs<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 5 ) was similar among African-Americans and Caucasians<GPE> ( 72 % versus 55 %, P<PERSON> = .062 ). After adjusting for potential confounders, the African-American race was not independently associated with a higher CMB<ORGANIZATION> burden ( P<PERSON> = .073 ). African-American race was not independently associated with a higher rate of CMB<ORGANIZATION> burden when compared to Caucasians after adjusting for potential confounders. We also did not observe a significant racial difference regarding the location and prevalence of multiple CMBs<ORGANIZATION> ( CMBs<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 5 ).
