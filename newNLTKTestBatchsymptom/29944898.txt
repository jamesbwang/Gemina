 Bombyx<GPE> mori bidensovirus ( BmBDV<ORGANIZATION> ) causes fatal ﬂacherie disease leading to severe economic losses in sericultures. The BmDNV-Z genome contains two single-stranded DNA<ORGANIZATION> molecules, VD1<ORGANIZATION> and VD2<ORGANIZATION>. For generating silkworm lines with antiviral properties, two transgenic RNA<ORGANIZATION> interference ( RNAi<ORGANIZATION> ) vectors were constructed. Open reading frames ( ORFs<ORGANIZATION> ) 1-4 of VD1<ORGANIZATION> were knockdown by vector pb-BDV1 while ORF1a<ORGANIZATION>, ORF1b<ORGANIZATION>, and ORF3<ORGANIZATION> of VD2<ORGANIZATION> were knockdown by vector pb-BDV2. Transgenic silkworm lines BDV1-I and BDV2-I were generated via RNAi<ORGANIZATION> microinjection. Mortality rates of BDV1-I and BDV2-I were reduced by 45 % and 39 %, respectively, and quantitative PCR<ORGANIZATION> showed that VD1<ORGANIZATION> and VD2<ORGANIZATION> contents in BDV1-I and BDV2-I were signiﬁcantly lower than in the non-transgenic line. However, economic traits showed no obvious differences. Thus, knockdown of multiple BmDNV-Z genes provides strong resistance to BDV1-I and BDV2-I lines, and these can be used in sericulture without hampering silk production.
