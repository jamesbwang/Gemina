 This article evaluates the potential long-term effect of two different color indication methods for self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG<ORGANIZATION> ), the color record ( CR ) and color display ( CD ), on metabolic parameters in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes in a post-intervention period. 101 participants with type 2 diabetes who completed the Color<ORGANIZATION> IMPACT study were enrolled in a 2-year comparison follow-up study. Participants continued SMBG<ORGANIZATION> with their usual diabetes care. The study outcomes were differences in change in HbA1c<GPE> levels, blood pressure ( BP ), body weight and lipid profiles between the CR<ORGANIZATION> and non-CR arms and the CD<ORGANIZATION> and non-CD arms during a 1- and 2-year period of the study. 98 participants were analyzed. Reductions in HbA1c<GPE> levels, systolic BP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were maintained in the CR<ORGANIZATION> arm by - 0.40 % ( 95 % CI: - 0.73 to - 0.06, p = 0.020 ), -1 3.2 mmHg ( 95 % CI: - 24.1 to - 2.3, p = 0.019 ), - 11.4 mg/dl ( 95 % CI: - 18.1 to - 4.6, p = 0.001 ), respectively, in a 1-year period. However, HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> and BP<ORGANIZATION> returned to the baseline levels during an additional 1-year period. In contrast, there were no significant changes in outcome in the CD arm during the study period. Intervention promoting self-action such as the color record method in SMBG<ORGANIZATION> sustains a beneficial effect on metabolic parameters after the intervention. This long-term effect is helpful for people with type 2 diabetes to manage their diabetes ABCs<ORGANIZATION> ( HbA1c<ORGANIZATION>, BP<ORGANIZATION>, cholesterol ) and to prevent diabetic complications.
