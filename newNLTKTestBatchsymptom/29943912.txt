 High<GPE> morbidity and mortality due to community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP<ORGANIZATION> ) is seen in children under 5 years of age in India<GPE>. Besides<PERSON> identified risk factors for CAP<ORGANIZATION>, there may be a phenotype-genotype association with cytokines, resulting in enhanced inflammatory response resulting in the adverse outcome ( AO ), namely complications and death. To assess the association of IL1RA<ORGANIZATION> gene polymorphism on serum levels of IL1RA<ORGANIZATION> and with AO<ORGANIZATION> in children under 5 years of age hospitalized with WHO-defined severe CAP. A prospective cohort study with nested case-control design conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital after obtaining institutional ethical approval. Included were children between 2 and 59 months of age hospitalized with WHO-defined severe CAP with consistent radiological abnormalities. Excluded were those with suspected or proven cystic fibrosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, malignancy, immunodeficiency, and congenital heart disease. Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR<ORGANIZATION> ) was used to analyze the Variable Number<ORGANIZATION> of Tandem Repeats<ORGANIZATION> ( VNTRs<ORGANIZATION> ) of IL1RA<ORGANIZATION> gene polymorphism and ELISA<ORGANIZATION> test to detect serum levels of IL1RA<ORGANIZATION>. From 2014 to 2016, of 420 screened cases, 350 were eligible and included, of which 132 ( 37.7 % ) had no complication and 218 ( 62.3 % ) had AO<ORGANIZATION>, which included complications like empyema, pyopneumothorax, acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS<ORGANIZATION> ), and septic shock of these 24 ( 6.9 % ) expired. Higher risk of AO<ORGANIZATION> was seen in A2A2<GPE> genotype ( OR 11.18, p 0.0001 ) and lower in A1A1<GPE> genotype ( OR 0.18, P<PERSON> < 0.0001 ). Serum IL1RA<PERSON> ( ng/mL ) was statistically significantly elevated in CAP with AO<ORGANIZATION> ( 2.55 ± 1.44 ) versus uncomplicated ( 0.87 ± 0.52 ) ( P<PERSON> < 0.0001 ). In IL1RA<GPE> gene, A1A1<GPE> genotype was associated with lower risk and A2A2<GPE> genotype with increased the risk of AO<ORGANIZATION>. Higher serum levels of IL1RA<ORGANIZATION> were found in A2A2<GPE> genotype indicating possibly enhanced inflammatory response resulting in AO of CAP<ORGANIZATION>.
