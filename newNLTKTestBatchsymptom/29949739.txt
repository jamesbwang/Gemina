 Large<GPE> granular lymphocytic leukemia ( LGLL<ORGANIZATION> ) is a chronic proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes in which over 70 % of patients develop cytopenia ( s ) requiring therapy. LGLL<ORGANIZATION> includes T-cell LGLL ( T-LGLL ) and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK-cells ( CLPD-NK ). The neoplastic cells in LGLL<ORGANIZATION> usually exhibit a single immunophenotype in a patient, with CD8-positive/αβ T-cell type being the most common, followed by NK-cell, γδ T-cell, and CD4-positive/αβ T-cell types. We investigated a total of 220 LGLL cases and identified 12 mixed-phenotype LGLLs<ORGANIZATION> ( 5 % ): 7 cases with coexistent αβ T-cell and NK-cell clones and 5 with coexistent αβ and γδ T-cell clones. With a median follow-up of 48months, the clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients appeared similar to those of typical LGLL<ORGANIZATION> patients. Treatment<PERSON> was instituted in 9 patients and 5 patients ( 55 % ) attained complete hematologic response ( CR ) or partial response ( PR ). The therapeutic response rate of this cohort is comparable to the reported overall response rate of 40-60 % in typical LGLL<ORGANIZATION> patients. Three patients who did not receive any treatment had progressive or persistent cytopenias. Interestingly, inverted proportions of two clones at disease recurrence were identified in 4 patients ( 36 % ) and stable clonal proportions in 7 patients ( 64 % ). Mixed-phenotype LGLL<ORGANIZATION> is rare, and this study underscores the importance of recognizing this rare type of LGLL<ORGANIZATION> in patients who may benefit from LGLL<ORGANIZATION> treatment.
