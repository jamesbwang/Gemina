 Renalase<GPE> is a catecholamine-metabolising enzyme, but its possible association with atrial fibrillation remains unknown. The study aimed to evaluate plasma renalase concentration in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) undergoing pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI<ORGANIZATION> ) with respect to AF clinical characteristics, left atrial ( LA<ORGANIZATION> ) remodeling and PVI<ORGANIZATION> efficacy. This case-control study covered 69 patients ( median age of 58 years ) with either paroxysmal ( 89 % ) or persistent AF ( 11 % ), subject to PVI<ORGANIZATION> and control group consisting of 15 equally matched patients without AF. The study involved evaluation of transthoracic echocardiography with LA<ORGANIZATION> speckle tracking and plasma renalase concentration using ELISA<ORGANIZATION> method. AF recurrence was defined as any AF episode on 7-day electrocardiographic monitoring at 6-month follow-up. Renalase<PERSON> level was higher in the study than control group ( 27.99 vs. 21.48 μg/mL, p = 0.004 ), but lower in patients with persistent AF ( 19.05 vs. 28.77 μg/mL ; p = 0.023 ) and among patients with AF<ORGANIZATION> episodes directly preceding PVI<ORGANIZATION> ( 24.50 vs. 29.66 μg/mL ; p = 0.04 ). Renalase<PERSON> concentration within first quartile was associated with higher mean heart rate ( 70 vs. 61/min, p = 0.029 ), greater AF burden ( 36.9 % vs. 9.3 %, p = 0.027 ), greater LA diameter ( 41.1 vs. 37.9 mm, p = 0.011 ) and a trend towards less negative global LA strain ( -9.4 vs. -13.5, p = 0.082 ). Logistic regression revealed global 4-chamber LA strain was the only independent predictor of renalase variability ( p = 0.0045 ). Renalase<PERSON> concentration did not predict AF recurrence at 6-month follow-up ( area under curve ; AUC<ORGANIZATION> = 0.614, p = 0.216 ). Low<PERSON> renalase levels may be associated with impaired rate control, higher AF burden and advanced LA remodeling in AF patients undergoing PVI but do not predict sinus rhythm maintenance.
