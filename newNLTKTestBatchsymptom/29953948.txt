 Along with its outstanding antidepressant effect, electroconvulsive shock ( ECS<ORGANIZATION> ) can induce learning and memory impairment. Propofol and ketamine have shown to be useful in alleviating the learning and memory impairment. Nevertheless, the mechanism still remains unclear. This study investigated the role of NMDA<ORGANIZATION> receptor ( NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> ) -mediated metaplasticity in the learning and memory impairment induced by ECS<ORGANIZATION>, as well as the neuroprotective effect of propofol and ketamine in depressive rats. Rats<PERSON> received ECS<ORGANIZATION> or ECS<ORGANIZATION> under anesthetics after chronic unpredictable mild stress procedure. Long-term potentiation ( LTP<ORGANIZATION> ) was tested by extracellular recording. LTD/LTP threshold was assessed by stimulation of different frequencies. Additionally, NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potential ( fEPSP<ORGANIZATION> ) and NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> input/output relationship were detected under hippocampal slice perfusion. Results<PERSON> showed that propofol or low-dose ketamine could partially alleviate ECS-induced LTP impairment, while propofol combined with low-dose ketamine almost reversed the LTP<ORGANIZATION> impairment. LTP under ECS<ORGANIZATION> was increased by stronger stimulation. ECS<ORGANIZATION> could up-regulated LTD/LTP threshold, while propofol or ketamine could down-regulate it. Moreover, ECS<ORGANIZATION> activated NMDAR<ORGANIZATION>, while propofol and ketamine could inhibit the activation of NMDAR<ORGANIZATION>. NMDAR input/output relationship decrease was induced by preconditioning ( an analog of ECS<ORGANIZATION> in hippocampal slice ), however, NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> input/output relationship increased by propofol or ketamine. In conclusion, ECS-induced cognitive impairment is caused by NMDAR-mediated metaplasticity via up-regulation of LTD/LTP threshold. Propofol or ketamine alleviates the cognitive impairment, possibly by down-regulating the threshold via inhibition of NMDAR<ORGANIZATION> activation induced by ECS<ORGANIZATION>.
