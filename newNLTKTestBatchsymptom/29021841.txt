 This study aimed to evaluate the atrial substrate in the left atrium ( LA<ORGANIZATION> ) by low-voltage areas ( LVAs<ORGANIZATION> ) and high-dominant frequencies ( DFs<ORGANIZATION> ) after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI<ORGANIZATION> ) in nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation ( AF ). In 70 patients with nonparoxysmal AF patients ( 41 persistent AF ), LA<ORGANIZATION> voltage maps were created during sinus rhythm by external cardioversion after PVI<ORGANIZATION> and DF<ORGANIZATION> mapping. The patients were divided into AF-free and AF-recurrent groups. The AF<ORGANIZATION> freedom rate without antiarrhythmic drugs was 69.0 % after PVI<ORGANIZATION> after 1 procedure during a 12-month follow-up. There was a significant difference in the LVA<ORGANIZATION> ( < 0.5 mV ) /LA surface area after PVI<ORGANIZATION> between the AF-free and AF-recurrent groups ( 15 % vs 23 %, LVAs<ORGANIZATION> were associated with AF<ORGANIZATION> recurrences after PVI<ORGANIZATION> in nonparoxysmal AF patients and overlapped with many high-DF sites. PVI alone may be enough to treat patients with mild-to-moderate extent ( â‰¤24 % ) of LVAs<ORGANIZATION>.
