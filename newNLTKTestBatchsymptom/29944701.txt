 Diagnosis<GPE> of tuberculosis in people living with HIV<ORGANIZATION> is challenging due to non-specific clinical presentations and inadequately sensitive diagnostic tests. The WHO<ORGANIZATION> recommends screening using a clinical algorithm followed by rapid diagnosis using the Xpert<ORGANIZATION> MTB/RIF assay, and more information is needed to evaluate these recommendations in different settings. From August 2012 to September 2013, consecutive adults newly diagnosed with HIV<ORGANIZATION> in Bamenda<GSP>, Cameroon<GPE>, were screened for TB<ORGANIZATION> regardless of symptoms by smear microscopy and culture ; the Xpert<ORGANIZATION> MTB/RIF assay was performed retrospectively. Time to treatment and patient outcomes were obtained from routine registers. Among 1,149 people enrolled, 940 ( 82 % ) produced sputum for lab testing ; of these, 68 % were women, the median age was 35 years ( IQR<ORGANIZATION>, 28-42 years ), the median CD4<ORGANIZATION> count was 291cells/μL ( IQR<ORGANIZATION>, 116-496 cells/μL ), and 86 % had one or more of current cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. In total, 131 people ( 14 %, 95 % CI, 12-16 % ) had sputum culture-positive TB. The WHO<ORGANIZATION> symptom screening algorithm had a sensitivity of 92 % ( 95 % CI, 86-96 % ) and specificity of 15 % ( 95 % CI, 12-17 % ) in this population. Compared to TB culture, the sensitivity of direct smear microscopy was 25 % ( 95 % CI, 18-34 % ), and the sensitivity of Xpert<PERSON> was 68 % ( 95 % CI, 58-76 ) ; the sensitivity of both was higher for people reporting more symptoms. Only one of 69 people with smear-negative/culture-positive TB was started on TB treatment prior to culture positivity. Of 71 people with bacteriologically-confirmed TB and known outcome after 6 months, 13 ( 17 % ) had died, including 11 people with smear-negative TB and 6 people with both smear and Xpert-negative TB. Use of the most sensitive rapid diagnostic test available is critical in people newly diagnosed with HIV<ORGANIZATION> in this setting to maximize the detection of bacteriologically-confirmed TB. However, this intervention is not sufficient alone and should be combined with more comprehensive clinical diagnosis of TB to improve outcomes.
