 In this study, we first reported a lateral flow assay combined with primer extension ( PEXT<ORGANIZATION> ) and gold nanoparticles for single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP<ORGANIZATION> ) genotyping of the tmigd1 gene of the Tsaiya<ORGANIZATION> ducks ( Anas<ORGANIZATION> platyrhynchos ), which has the advantages of simplicity of operation, cost-effectiveness, and time-saving. Gold nanoparticles were tailed with thiol-thymine oligodeoxyribonucleotides ( thiol- ( dT ) 30 ) using the salt-aging method at 25Â°C and used as a label in a lateral flow assay. The lateral flow device was composed of test and control zones on a nitrocellulose membrane containing streptavidin and adenosine oligodeoxyribonucleotides ( ( dA ) 30 ), respectively. When the specific SNP<ORGANIZATION> existed, the corresponding primers were extended, and the reaction product was captured by streptavidin at the test zone owing to the introduction of biotin-deoxyuridine triphosphate ( biotin-dUTP ) into the reaction product during PEXT<ORGANIZATION>. Gold<ORGANIZATION> nanoparticles hybridized with the reaction product to render it visible. Here, we developed a new system for detection of single nucleotide polymorphism in a female reproduction-associated gene, tmigd1, of Anas<GPE> platyrhynchos using the strip biosensor, and identified the optimized parameters for the concentration of Mg2+ in the PEXT<ORGANIZATION> reaction and the amount of streptavidin used on membranes for signal specificity.
