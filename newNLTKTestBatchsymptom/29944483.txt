 Breast<GPE> cancer screening using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) has limited accessibility due to high costs of breast MRI<ORGANIZATION>. Ultrafast<PERSON> dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI can be acquired within 2 minutes. We aimed to assess whether screening performance of breast radiologist using an ultrafast breast MRI-only screening protocol is as good as performance using a full multiparametric diagnostic MRI<ORGANIZATION> protocol ( FDP<ORGANIZATION> ). The institutional review board approved this study, and waived the need for informed consent. Between<PERSON> January 2012 and June 2014, 1791 consecutive breast cancer screening examinations from 954 women with a lifetime risk of more than 20 % were prospectively collected. All women were scanned using a 3 T protocol interleaving ultrafast breast MRI<ORGANIZATION> acquisitions in a full multiparametric diagnostic MRI<ORGANIZATION> protocol consisting of standard dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging, and T2-weighted imaging. Subsequently, a case set was created including all biopsied screen-detected lesions in this period ( 31 malignant and 54 benign ) and 116 randomly selected normal cases with more than 2 years of follow-up. Prior examinations were included when available. Seven<PERSON> dedicated breast radiologists read all 201 examinations and 153 available priors once using the FDP<ORGANIZATION> and once using ultrafast breast MRI<ORGANIZATION> only in 2 counterbalanced and crossed-over reading sessions. For reading the FDP<ORGANIZATION> versus ultrafast breast MRI<ORGANIZATION> alone, sensitivity was 0.86 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 0.81-0.90 ) versus 0.84 ( 95 % CI, 0.78-0.88 ) ( P<PERSON> = 0.50 ), specificity was 0.76 ( 95 % CI, 0.74-0.79 ) versus 0.82 ( 95 % CI, 0.79-0.84 ) ( P<PERSON> = 0.002 ), positive predictive value was 0.40 ( 95 % CI, 0.36-0.45 ) versus 0.45 ( 95 % CI, 0.41-0.50 ) ( P<PERSON> = 0.14 ), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.89 ( 95 % CI, 0.82-0.96 ) versus 0.89 ( 95 % CI, 0.82-0.96 ) ( P<PERSON> = 0.83 ). Ultrafast<PERSON> breast MRI<ORGANIZATION> reading was 22.8 % faster than reading FDP<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). Interreader agreement is significantly better for ultrafast breast MRI<ORGANIZATION> ( κ = 0.730 ; 95 % CI, 0.699-0.761 ) than for the FDP<ORGANIZATION> ( κ = 0.665 ; 95 % CI, 0.633-0.696 ). Breast MRI<PERSON> screening using only an ultrafast breast MRI<ORGANIZATION> protocol is noninferior to screening with an FDP<ORGANIZATION> and may result in significantly higher screening specificity and shorter reading time.
