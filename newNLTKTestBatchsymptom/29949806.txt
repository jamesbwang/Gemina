 Ovarian<GPE> theca cell hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS<ORGANIZATION> is compounded by androgen receptor-mediated impairment of estradiol and progesterone negative feedback regulation of episodic LH release. The resultant LH hypersecretion, likely the product of accelerated episodic release of GnRH<ORGANIZATION> from the median eminence of the hypothalamus, hyperstimulates ovarian theca cell steroidogenesis, enabling testosterone ( T ) and androstenedione excess. Prenatally androgenized female monkeys ( PA ) exposed to fetal male levels of T during early-to-mid gestation, when adult, demonstrate PCOS-like traits, including high T and LH<ORGANIZATION> levels. This study tests the hypothesis that progesterone resistance-associated acceleration in episodic LH release contributes to PA monkey LH excess. 4 PA and 3 regularly cycling, healthy control adult female rhesus monkeys of comparable age and body mass index underwent ( 1 ) a 10 h, frequent intravenous sampling assessment for LH<ORGANIZATION> episodic release, immediately followed by ( 2 ) IV infusion of exogenous GnRH<ORGANIZATION> to quantify continuing pituitary LH responsiveness, and subsequently ( 3 ) an SC injection of a progesterone receptor antagonist, mifepristone, to examine LH responses to blockade of progesterone-mediated action. Compared to controls, the relatively hyperandrogenic PA females exhibited ~100 % increase ( p = 0.037 ) in LH pulse frequency, positive correlation of LH<ORGANIZATION> pulse amplitude ( p = 0.017 ) with androstenedione, ~100 % greater increase ( p = 0.034 ) in acute ( 0 -- 10 min ) LH responses to exogenous GnRH<ORGANIZATION>, and an absence ( p = 0.008 ) of modest LH elevation following acute progesterone receptor blockade suggestive of diminished progesterone negative feedback. Such dysregulation of LH<ORGANIZATION> release in PCOS-like monkeys implicates impaired feedback control of episodic release of hypothalamic GnRH<ORGANIZATION> reminiscent of PCOS<ORGANIZATION> neuroendocrinopathy.
