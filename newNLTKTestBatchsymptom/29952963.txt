 Beh√ßet<GPE> disease ( BD ) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, ocular lesions, and skin lesions. Complication of amyloidosis in patients with BD<ORGANIZATION> is rare. Here, we report a case of BD with immunoglobulin light chain ( AL<ORGANIZATION> ) -amyloidosis manifested as hematochezia. A 61-year-old man developed sudden hematochezia due to bleeding from multiple small colonic ulcers ; AL-amyloid deposition was found on immunohistochemical examination of biopsy specimen of colonic ulcer. Systemic<PERSON> investigation revealed cardiac disfunction with cardiomegaly and progressive renal dysfunction, which indicated the presence of systemic AL-amyloidosis. Based on the findings of colonic ulcers with cardiac and renal involvement, a diagnosis of systemic AL-amyloidosis complicated by incomplete BD was established. He was treated with increased dose of oral prednisolone ( 20 mg/day ), colchicine and mesalazine, because he was reluctant to receive aggressive chemotherapy ( melphalan and dexamethasone ) or autologous stem cell transplantation. Colonic ulcers completely diminished after treatment, however, he died because of severe urinary tract infection and progressive renal failure after one year of gastrointestinal ( GI ) manifestations. Our case shows that patients with BD<ORGANIZATION> may have GI manifestations due not only to entero-BD but also due to GI amyloidosis.
