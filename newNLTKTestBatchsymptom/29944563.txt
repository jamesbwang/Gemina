 The purpose of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser photocoagulation in the treatment of vascular malformations in the oral and perioral area ; 93 patients ( 104 lesions ) were evaluated in an Ambulatory of Oral Medicine<ORGANIZATION> ( 2006-2013 ). The sample consisted of 57 women ( 61 % ) and 36 men ( 39 % ), aged 8 to 85 years. The lesion size was smaller than 3 cm in most patients. The lesions were located on the lips, jugal mucosa, tongue, palate, gingiva, and retromolar trigone. All patients were treated on an outpatient basis using local anesthesia and Nd: YAG laser ( Power Laser<PERSON> C ) with a wavelength of 1064 nm and a fiber optic diameter of 400 Î¼m. After treatment no patients had complications, however, in patients of deep lesions, 2 or more irradiations were required to treat the lesions. Finally, the authors conclude that the clinical and aesthetic satisfactory results of the 93 patients treated with Nd<PERSON>: YAG laser suggest that this type of laser is effective and safe in the treatment of oral and perioral vascular malformations.
