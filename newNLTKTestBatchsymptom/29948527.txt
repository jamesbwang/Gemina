 To address the limited research on diverse families of children with ASD<ORGANIZATION>, we examined the impact of ASD<ORGANIZATION> on 46 Latina<GPE> and 56 non-Latina White<FACILITY> mothers from a resiliency perspective. We explored perceptions of family problems, optimism and pessimism among mothers of child with ASD<ORGANIZATION> between 1 and 22 years old. Mothers were recruited through support groups and listservs. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> and multivariate analyses were conducted. Results<PERSON> indicated fewer perceived family problems and less pessimism about the child 's future among Latina<GPE> mothers.
