 The aim of this study was to compare the bleaching efficacy and tooth sensitivity ( TS ) of a 38 % hydrogen peroxide bleaching agent used for in-office bleaching, applied under different time protocols: a 40-minute application or two 20-minute applications. Forty-four patients from Brazil<GPE> and Colombia<GPE>, with right superior canines darker than C2, were selected for this multicenter, single-blind, randomized trial. The teeth were bleached in two sessions, with a one-week interval between them, in a split-mouth design. The bleaching agent was applied in two 20-minute ( 2×20 ) applications or one 40-minute ( 1×40 ) application in each session according to the manufacturer 's instructions. The color changes were evaluated by using subjective ( Vita Classical<ORGANIZATION> and Vita Bleachedguide<PERSON> ) and objective ( Easyshade Spectrophotometer<PERSON> ) methods at baseline and 30 days after the second session. Tooth sensitivity was recorded up to 48 hours with a 0-10 visual analog scale. Also, the pH<ORGANIZATION> values during the application of bleaching were recorded. Color<PERSON> change in shade guide units and ΔE were analyzed by using the Student<ORGANIZATION> t-test ( α=0.05 ). The absolute risk and intensity of TS were evaluated with the McNemar<ORGANIZATION> test, the Wilcoxon<ORGANIZATION> signed-rank test, and the Friedman test, respectively ( α= 0.05 ). Significant whitening was observed in both groups after 30 days of clinical evaluation. The use of a 40-minute application did not significantly influence the absolute risk of TS<GPE> ( 68 %, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 53-80 ) as well as the intensity of TS<ORGANIZATION> compared with the acid bleaching gel ( absolute risk of 82 %, 95 % CI = 68-91 ). The pH<ORGANIZATION> values did not differ significantly between groups and at the different assessment periods ( p=0.42 ). The use of a 40-minute in-office bleaching agent gel application produced the same whitening degree and TS that the two 20-minute bleaching agent applications did. The former preferably should be applied because one 40-minute application does not require gel refreshing.
