 Macrophages are key immune cells for the initiation and development of atherosclerotic lesions. However, the macrophage regulatory nodes that determine how lesions progress in response to dietary challenges are not fully understood. Liver X<PERSON> receptors ( LXRs<ORGANIZATION> ) are sterol-regulated transcription factors that play a central role in atherosclerosis by integrating cholesterol homeostasis and immunity. LXR<ORGANIZATION> pharmacological activation elicits a robust antiatherosclerotic transcriptional program in macrophages that can be affected by LXRÎ± S196<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation in vitro. To investigate the impact of these transcriptional changes in atherosclerosis development, we have generated mice carrying a Ser-to-Ala mutation in myeloid cells in the LDL<ORGANIZATION> receptor ( LDLR<ORGANIZATION> ) -deficient atherosclerotic background ( M-S196A
