 Single<GPE> ventricle ( SV ) patients with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection ( TAPVC<ORGANIZATION> ) are at high risk. Given the limited published data available, we examined outcomes and the implications of a prenatal diagnosis of SV/TAPVC. A single-center, retrospective review was performed in neonates with SV/TAPVC from 1998 to 2014, identified through institutional databases. Patient<PERSON> demographic, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected. Thirty-four eligible infants with SV/TAPVC were identified ( mean birth weight: 3.0 kg ). The TAPVC<ORGANIZATION> types were supracardiac ( 59 % ), infracardiac ( 21 % ), mixed ( 12 % ), and cardiac ( 9 % ). Heterotaxy<PERSON> syndrome was present in 25 ( 74 % ) infants. A prenatal diagnosis of SV<ORGANIZATION> was made in 26 ( 76 % ) infants, with TAPVC<ORGANIZATION> identified in 12 ( 35 % ). Seventeen ( 50 % ) had obstructed TAPVC<ORGANIZATION> within the first 48 hours of life ; 7 of these patients had obstructed TAPVC<ORGANIZATION> identified prenatally. There were two preoperative deaths. Overall survival for the cohort was 65 % at 1 year and 50 % at 3 years. Survival in the obstructed group was significantly worse compared to the unobstructed group ( 47 % vs 81 % at 1 year ; 27 % vs 73 % at 3 years, P<PERSON> = .01 ). Obstructed TAPVC<ORGANIZATION> and a prenatal prediction of obstructed TAPVC were significantly associated with postoperative mortality ( P<PERSON> = .01 and .03, respectively ). Patients with SV/TAPVC remain a high-risk group, with obstructed TAPVC a significant risk factor for mortality. Prenatal diagnosis of TAPVC<ORGANIZATION> in SV patients is challenging, but given those with obstructed TAPVC are especially at high risk, improved prenatal diagnostic techniques in this group may enhance counseling/delivery planning.
