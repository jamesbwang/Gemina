 Here high-speed Digital Holographic Microscopy<ORGANIZATION> ( DHM<ORGANIZATION> ) records sperm flagellar waveforms and swimming paths in 4 dimensions ( X, Z<GPE>, and t ). We find flagellar excursions into the Z-plane nearly as large as the envelope of the flagellar waveform projected onto the XY-plane. These Z-plane excursions travel as waves down the flagellum each beat cycle. DHM<ORGANIZATION> also tracks the heads of free-swimming sperm and the dynamics and chirality of rolling of sperm around their long axis. We find that mouse sperm roll CW at the maximum positive Z-plane excursion of the head, then roll CCW<ORGANIZATION> at the subsequent maximum negative Z-plane excursion. This alternating chirality of rolling indicates sperm have a chiral memory. Procrustes alignments of path trajectories for sequences of roll-counterroll cycles show that path chirality is always CW for the cells analyzed in this study. Human<PERSON> and bull sperm lack distinguishable left and right surfaces, but DHM<ORGANIZATION> still indicates coordination of Z-plane excursions and rolling events. We propose that sperm have a chiral memory that resides in a hypothetical elastic linkage within the flagellar machinery, which stores some of the torque required for a CW or CCW<ORGANIZATION> roll to reuse in the following counter-roll. Separate mechanisms control path chirality.
