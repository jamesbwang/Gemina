 The convolutional neural network ( CNN<ORGANIZATION> ) has been applied to the classification problem of DNA<ORGANIZATION> sequences, with the additional purpose of motif discovery. The training of CNNs<ORGANIZATION> with distributed representations of four nucleotides has successfully derived position weight matrices on the learned kernels that corresponded to sequence motifs such as protein-binding sites. We propose a novel application of CNNs<ORGANIZATION> to classification of pairwise alignments of sequences for accurate clustering of sequences and show the benefits of the CNN<ORGANIZATION> method of inputting pairwise alignments for clustering of non-coding RNA<ORGANIZATION> ( ncRNA<ORGANIZATION> ) sequences and for motif discovery. Classification of a pairwise alignment of two sequences into positive and negative classes corresponds to the clustering of the input sequences. After we combined the distributed representation of RNA<ORGANIZATION> nucleotides with the secondary-structure information specific to ncRNAs and furthermore with mapping profiles of next-generation sequence reads, the training of CNNs<ORGANIZATION> for classification of alignments of RNA<ORGANIZATION> sequences yielded accurate clustering in terms of ncRNA<ORGANIZATION> families and outperformed the existing clustering methods for ncRNA<ORGANIZATION> sequences. Several interesting sequence motifs and secondary-structure motifs known for the snoRNA<ORGANIZATION> family and specific to microRNA<ORGANIZATION> and tRNA families were identified. The source code of our CNN<ORGANIZATION> software in the deep-learning framework Chainer<PERSON> is available at http: //www.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/cnn/, and the dataset used for performance evaluation in this work is available at the same URL<ORGANIZATION>.
