 Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs<ORGANIZATION> ) greatly increase the risk of maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy. Currently<PERSON>, international agreements regarding the management of these women are lacking. Our study aimed to assess the current management and outcomes of MPN<ORGANIZATION> pregnancies in a French<GPE> cohort. We retrospectively analyzed 27 pregnancies in women with MPNs<ORGANIZATION> that were associated with a specific mutation. Nineteen pregnancies in nine women with essential thrombocythemia and eight pregnancies in five women with polycythemia vera were identified. Our study showed 70 % live births, but only 30 % uneventful pregnancies. Fetal complications were mainly early spontaneous abortions ( 22 % ), fetal growth restriction ( 15 % ), and premature delivery ( 15 % ). Maternal issues were divided between thrombosis ( 15 % ) and hemorrhages ( 11 % ). High rates of preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome ( 15 % ) were reported. Uterine<PERSON> artery Doppler<PERSON> was performed in 70 % pregnancies. Abnormal Doppler<PERSON> results were found in 43 % pregnancies. Pregnancies with high platelet counts and packed cell volume remaining static or increasing ended with fetal death and utero-placental dysfunction. According to expert consensus, most of the pregnancies ( 67 % ) could be stratified in the high risk group and had a bad obstetrical outcome, with 50 % standard-risk pregnancies versus 22 % high-risk pregnancies that were uneventful. Higher risk pregnancies were prescribed heparin and/or interferon α in 72 %. The prognosis of these pregnancies remains very bad and may be improved by a more effective collaboration between specialists as well as a therapeutic intensification including heparin and interferon α.
