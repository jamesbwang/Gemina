 Symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause ( GSM<ORGANIZATION> ) are bothersome to middle-aged and older women, and affect their quality of life ( QoL<ORGANIZATION> ), sexuality, and daily activities. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of vaginal symptoms and GSM<ORGANIZATION> on the well-being, functioning, and QoL<ORGANIZATION> of postmenopausal women from Spain<GPE>. This study involved 423 postmenopausal women participating in the GENISSE<ORGANIZATION> study ( a multicenter, cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study ) who presented at least 1 vaginal symptom. All women completed the `` day-to-day impact of vaginal aging '' ( DIVA<ORGANIZATION> ) questionnaire. Analysis of total scores and subdomains of the questionnaire were performed in women diagnosed with GSM<ORGANIZATION> and those without the condition. In these women, the highest mean scores on the DIVA<ORGANIZATION> questionnaire were found in the sexual functioning domain long version ( mean 1.8 ; SD 1.0 ), followed by the sexual functioning domain short version ( mean 1.7 ; SD 1.1 ), self-perception and body image ( mean 1.4 ; SD 1.1 ), activities of daily living ( mean 0.7 ; SD 0.8 ), and emotional well-being ( mean 0.7 ; SD 0.8 ) scales. A total of 299 women ( 70.7 % ) had vaginal symptoms with a diagnosis of GSM<ORGANIZATION>, whereas 124 ( 29.3 % ) had no GSM diagnosis. Scores on the DIVA<ORGANIZATION> questionnaire were significantly higher in women with a diagnosis of GSM<ORGANIZATION> than in those without this condition. Vaginal symptoms impact the well-being, functioning, and QoL<ORGANIZATION> of postmenopausal women, especially sexual function, self-perception, and body image. This impact is significantly higher in women with GSM<ORGANIZATION>. Identifying and treating patients affected by vaginal symptoms and GSM<ORGANIZATION> may be beneficial for improving their QoL.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution<ORGANIZATION> License 4.0 ( CCBY<ORGANIZATION> ), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. http: //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0.
