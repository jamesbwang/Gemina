 To evaluate lung function and inspiratory muscle strength, correlating them with exercise tolerance, in obese individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS<ORGANIZATION> ). The sample comprised 31 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe OSAS<ORGANIZATION> diagnosed by polysomnography. We used spirometry to measure FVC<ORGANIZATION>, FEV1<ORGANIZATION>, and FVC/FEV1 ratio, using pressure manometry to measure MIP<ORGANIZATION> and MEP<ORGANIZATION>. The incremental shuttle walk test ( ISWT<ORGANIZATION> ) and the six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) were used in order to determine functional exercise capacity. In this sample, the mean values for FVC<ORGANIZATION> ( % of predicted ), FEV1<ORGANIZATION> ( % of predicted ): MIP, and MEP<ORGANIZATION> were 76.4 ± 12.3 %, 80.1 ± 6.3 %, 60.0 ± 21.9 cmH2O, and 81.3 ± 22.2 cmH2O, respectively. The mean distances covered on the ISWT<ORGANIZATION> and 6MWT were 221 ± 97 m and 480.8 ± 67.3 m, respectively. The ISWT<ORGANIZATION> distance showed moderate positive correlations with FVC<ORGANIZATION> ( r = 0.658 ; p = 0.001 ) and FEV1<ORGANIZATION> ( r = 0.522 ; p = 0.003 ). In this sample of obese subjects with untreated OSAS<ORGANIZATION>, lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, and exercise tolerance were all below normal. In addition, we found that a decline in lung function, but not in respiratory muscle strength, was associated with exercise tolerance in these patients.
