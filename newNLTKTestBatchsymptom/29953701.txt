 To determine the association of differential leukocyte counts on admission with efficacy and safety outcomes in acute ischemic stroke ( AIS<ORGANIZATION> ) patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis ( IVT<ORGANIZATION> ). Consecutive AIS<ORGANIZATION> patients receiving IVT<ORGANIZATION> were evaluated at two stroke centers. Differential leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR<ORGANIZATION> ) were determined during initial 12 hours of admission. Efficacy<PERSON> outcomes involved favorable functional outcome ( FFO<ORGANIZATION> ) [ mRS-scores of 0-1 ] and functional independence ( FI ) [ mRS-scores of 0-2 ] at three months ; whereas safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( sICH<ORGANIZATION> ) and three-month mortality. Among 657 IVT-treated AIS<ORGANIZATION> patients, mean age was 64±14, 50 % were female and median NIHSS<ORGANIZATION> was 7 points [ IQR<ORGANIZATION> 4-13 ]. Lower neutrophil, leukocyte and NLR<ORGANIZATION> counts were observed in patients with 3-month FFO<ORGANIZATION> and FI<ORGANIZATION>, whereas higher counts were observed in patients who expired at three months. The best discriminative factor for 3-month FFO<ORGANIZATION> and FI were NLR<ORGANIZATION> < 2.2 ( sensitivity 51.4 %, specificity 63.1 % ) and leukocyte < 8,100/μL ( sensitivity 57.5 %, specificity 55.1 % ), respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, NLR<ORGANIZATION> < 2.2 was associated with higher odds of FFO<ORGANIZATION> ( OR: 1.56 ; 95 % CI: 1.08-2.24 ; p=0.018 ), leukocyte count < 8,100/μL was associated with higher odds of 3-month FI ( OR: 1.69 ; 95 % CI: 1.11-2.57 ; p=0.014 ) and lower odds of 3-month mortality ( OR: 0.31 ; 95 % CI: 0.16-0.60 ; p=0.001 ), whereas combined neutrophil ( < 6,800/μL ) and leukocyte ( < 8,100/μL ) counts were associated with 3-month FI ( OR: 1.73 ; 95 % CI: 1.13-2.67 ; p=0.012 ). Admission differential leukocyte counts are independently associated with clinical outcomes in AIS<ORGANIZATION> patients treated with IVT<ORGANIZATION> and might represent potential inflammatory targets for adjunctive neuroprotection in this stroke subgroup.
