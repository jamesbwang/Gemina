 Canine<GPE> neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs<ORGANIZATION> ) in response to lipopolysaccharide but NETs<ORGANIZATION> from clinical septic dogs had not been identified. The primary aim is to describe the methodology of identifying and quantifying neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs<ORGANIZATION> ) in cytology samples of septic foci in dogs with sepsis using immunofluorescence microscopy. Cytology<PERSON> samples including endotracheal tracheal wash ( ETW<ORGANIZATION> ), bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL<ORGANIZATION> ), abdominal and pleural effusion collected from 5 dogs ( 3 septic, 2 non-septic ) were fixed, permeabilized and stained for myeloperoxidase ( MPO<ORGANIZATION> ), citrullinated histone H3 ( citH3<ORGANIZATION> ) and cell-free DNA<ORGANIZATION> ( cfDNA<ORGANIZATION> ). Fluorescence microscopy was used to identify and quantify NETs<ORGANIZATION> in 10 random views at 40Ã— magnification. NETs<ORGANIZATION> were identified based on co-localization of MPO<ORGANIZATION>, citH3<ORGANIZATION> and cfDNA<ORGANIZATION>. NETs<ORGANIZATION> were quantified as a ratio ( number of NETs<ORGANIZATION>: number of neutrophils ). Neutrophils were identified based on cytoplasmic MPO<ORGANIZATION>, cellular diameter and nuclear morphology. NETs<ORGANIZATION> were identified and quantified in all cytology samples collected from septic dogs. A small number of NETs<ORGANIZATION> was documented in one dog with sterile chronic bronchitis. No NETs<ORGANIZATION> were found in sterile abdominal effusion collected from one dog with congestive heart failure. Immunofluorescence microscopy could be a useful tool for the study of NETs<ORGANIZATION> in dogs with clinical sepsis.
