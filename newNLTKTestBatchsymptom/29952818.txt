 Cognitive capacity may be reduced from inflammation, surgery, anesthesia, and pain. In this study, we hypothesized that incision-induced nociceptive input impairs attentional performance and alters neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex. Attentional performance was measured in rats by using the titration variant of the 5-choice serial reaction time to determine the effect of surgical incision and anesthesia in a visual attention task. Neuronal activity ( single spike and local field potentials ) was measured in the medial prefrontal cortex in animals during the task. Incision significantly impaired attention postoperatively ( area under curve of median cue duration-time 97.2 ± 56.8 [ n = 9 ] vs. anesthesia control 25.5 ± 14.5 s-days [ n = 9 ], P<PERSON> = 0.002 ; effect size, η = 0.456 ). Morphine ( 1 mg/kg ) reduced impairment after incision ( area under curve of median cue duration-time 31.6 ± 36.7 [ n = 11 ] vs. saline 110 ± 64.7 s-days [ n = 10 ], P<PERSON> < 0.001 ; η = 0.378 ). Incision<PERSON> also decreased cell activity ( n = 24 ; 1.48 ± 0.58 vs. control, 2.93 ± 2.02 bursts/min ; P = 0.002 ; η = 0.098 ) and local field potentials ( n = 28 ; η = 0.111 ) in the medial prefrontal cortex. These results show that acute postoperative nociceptive input from incision reduces attention-related task performance and decreases neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Decreased neuronal activity suggests nociceptive input is more than just a distraction because neuronal activity increases during audiovisual distraction with similar behavioral impairment. This suggests that nociceptive input and the medial prefrontal cortex may contribute to attentional impairment and mild cognitive dysfunction postoperatively. In this regard, pain may affect postoperative recovery and return to normal activities through attentional impairment by contributing to lapses in concentration for routine and complex tasks.
