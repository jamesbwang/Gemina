 Glyphosate-based herbicides ( GBHs<ORGANIZATION> ) are the most globally used herbicides raising the risk of environmental exposition. Here, we investigated whether perinatal exposure to low doses of a GBH<ORGANIZATION> alters the female reproductive performance, and/or induced second-generation effects related to congenital anomalies or growth alterations. Pregnant rats ( F0 ) received a GBH<ORGANIZATION> through food, in a dose of 2 mg ( GBH-LD: GBH-low dose group ) or 200 mg ( GBH-HD: GBH-high dose group ) of glyphosate/kg bw/day from gestational day ( GD ) 9 until weaning. Body<PERSON> weight gain and vaginal canal-opening of F1<GPE> females were recorded. Sexually mature F1 females were mated to evaluate their reproductive performance by assessing the pregnancy rate, and on GD19<ORGANIZATION>, the number of corpora lutea, the implantation sites ( IS ) and resorption sites. To analyze second-generation effects on F2 offspring, we analyzed the fetal morphology on GD19<ORGANIZATION>, and assessed the fetal length and weight, and the placental weight. GBH<ORGANIZATION> exposure neither altered the body weight gain of F1<GPE> females, nor vaginal opening onset. Although all GBH-exposed F1 rats became pregnant, a lower number of IS<ORGANIZATION> was detected. F2 offspring from both GBH<ORGANIZATION> groups showed delayed growth, evidenced by lower fetal weight and length, associated with a higher incidence of small for gestational age fetuses. In addition, higher placental weight and placental index were found in F2 offspring from GBH-HD dams. Surprisingly, structural congenital anomalies ( conjoined fetuses and abnormally developed limbs ) were detected in the F2 offspring from GBH-HD group. In conclusion, perinatal exposure to low doses of a GBH<ORGANIZATION> impaired female reproductive performance and induced fetal growth retardation and structural congenital anomalies in F2<GPE> offspring.
