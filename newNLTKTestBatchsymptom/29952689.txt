 Autosomal-dominant optic atrophy ( ADOA<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the most common types of inherited optic atrophy. We identify OPA1<ORGANIZATION> pathogenic variants and assess the clinical features of a cohort of Chinese<GPE> ADOA<ORGANIZATION> patients Materials and Methods<ORGANIZATION>: Detailed clinical evaluations were performed and genomic DNA<ORGANIZATION> was extracted from peripheral blood for all the participants. Sanger<PERSON> sequencing was used to analyze all exons and exon/intron junctions of OPA1<ORGANIZATION> for eight pedigrees. Target<PERSON> exome capture plus next-generation sequencing ( NGS<ORGANIZATION> ) were applied for one atypical family with photophobia. Reverse<PERSON> transcription polymerase chain reaction was carried out to further characterize the mRNA<ORGANIZATION> change of selected splicing alteration. All 17 patients had impaired vision and optic-disk pallor ; however, the clinical severity varied markedly. Two patients complicated with hearing loss. Six novel and two reported pathogenic variants in OPA1<GPE> ( GenBank<ORGANIZATION> Accession No. NM_130837.2 ) were identified including four nonsynonymous variants ( c.2400T > G, c.1468T > C, c.1567A > G and c.1466T > C ), two splicing variants ( c.2984-1_2986delGAGA and c.2983 + 5G > A ), one small deletion ( c.2960_2968delGCGTTCAAC ), and one small insertion ( c.3009_3010insA ). RNA<ORGANIZATION> analysis revealed the splicing variant c.2984-1_2986delGAGA caused small deletion of mRNA<ORGANIZATION> ( r.2983_2988del ). ADOA patients presented variable clinical manifestations. Novel OPA1<PERSON> pathogenic variants are the main genetic defect for Chinese<GSP> ADOA<ORGANIZATION> cases. NGS<ORGANIZATION> may be a useful molecular testing tool for atypical ADOA<ORGANIZATION>.
