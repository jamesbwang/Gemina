 Hyperphosphatemia<GPE> is a common complication of chronic kidney disease ( CKD<ORGANIZATION> ) and is associated with cardiovascular disease ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ), which has contributed to an increase in mortality of CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients. The onset of CVD<ORGANIZATION> often varies by time-of-day. Acute<PERSON> myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia occurs most frequently during early morning. Blood<PERSON> pressure ( BP ) and heart rate circadian rhythms account for the diurnal variations in CVD<ORGANIZATION>. Preservation of normal circadian time structure from the cardiomyocyte level to the whole organ system is essential for cardiovascular health and CVD<ORGANIZATION> prevention. Independent risk factors, such as reduced heart rate variability ( HRV<ORGANIZATION> ) and increased BP variability ( BPV<ORGANIZATION> ), are particularly prevalent in patients with CKD<ORGANIZATION>. Analysis of HRV<ORGANIZATION> is an important clinical tool for characterizing cardiac autonomic status, and reduced HRV<ORGANIZATION> has prognostic significance for various types of CVD<ORGANIZATION>. Circadian BP<PERSON> rhythms are classified as extreme dipper, dipper, non-dipper or riser. It has been reported that nocturnal riser BP pattern contributes to cardiovascular threats. Previous studies have indicated that the circadian rhythm of serum phosphate in CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients is consistent with the general population, with the highest diurnal value observed in the early morning hours, followed by a progressive decrease to the lowest value of the day, which occurs around 11:00 am. Rhythm abnormalities have become the main therapeutic target for treating CVD<ORGANIZATION> in CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients. It has been reported that high levels of serum phosphate are associated with reduced HRV<ORGANIZATION> and increased BPV<ORGANIZATION> in CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients. However, the mechanisms related to interactions between hyperphosphatemia, HRV<ORGANIZATION> and BPV<ORGANIZATION> have not been fully elucidated. This review focuses on the evidence and discusses the potential mechanisms related to the effects of hyperphosphatemia on HRV<ORGANIZATION> and BPV<ORGANIZATION>.
