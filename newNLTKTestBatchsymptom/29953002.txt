 Primary central nervous system histiocytic sarcoma ( PCNSHS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a rare lymphohematopoietic tumor with a histiocytic cell origin. To our knowledge, only 28 cases have been published in English<GPE> and 2 cases in Chinese<GPE>. A 49-year-old Asian<GPE> female presented to the hospital with a 2 month history of hypomnesia, odynophagia, and gait disorder. Physical examination demonstrated decreased lower extremity muscle strength. The patient denied a history of malignancy. Radiology<PERSON> demonstrated a lesion in parietal lobe with uniformenhancement. Histologic analysis showed pleomorphic tumor cells with a loose arrangement, effacing the normal brain tissue. The tumor cells exhibited abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, highly atypical nuclei and predominant nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry<PERSON> revealed positive immunoreactivity for CD45<ORGANIZATION>, lysozyme, CD68<ORGANIZATION>, and CD163<ORGANIZATION>, and negative for pan-cytokeratin ( CK ), epithelial membrane antigen ( EMA<ORGANIZATION> ), glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP<ORGANIZATION> ), CD3<ORGANIZATION>, CD20<ORGANIZATION>, CD1a<ORGANIZATION>, CD79a<ORGANIZATION>, CD138<ORGANIZATION>, oligodendrocyte transcription factor ( olig2 ), CD15<ORGANIZATION>, melan-A, CD30<ORGANIZATION>, CD21<ORGANIZATION>, CD35<ORGANIZATION>, Human Melanoma<PERSON> Black-45 ( HMB45<ORGANIZATION> ), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase-1 ( ALK-1 ). The diagnosis of PCNSHS<ORGANIZATION> was rendered. The patient underwent complete surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up information shows the patient died 8 months following the initial diagnosis. PCNSHS<ORGANIZATION> is extremely rare with an aggressive clinical course. Immunohistiochemistry<PERSON> is necessary to make this diagnosis and to exclude other primary intracranial and lymphohematopoietic tumors. Further<PERSON> research is required to improve the outcome of patients with PCNSHS<ORGANIZATION>.
