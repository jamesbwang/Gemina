 Immunotherapy<GPE> with PD-1 antibodies has greatly increased prognosis of patients with advanced melanoma. Identifying biomarkers that predict overall survival ( OS ) and response to immunotherapy is important. OS and best overall response according to RECIST<ORGANIZATION> version 1.1 were analysed, and S100B<PERSON> and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH<ORGANIZATION> ) serum levels were assessed retrospectively in 152 patients treated with anti-PD-1, and in 86 patients treated with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibodies at University Hospital Tuebingen<ORGANIZATION>, Germany<GPE>. In the pembrolizumab group, patients with elevated baseline S100B<PERSON> or LDH<ORGANIZATION> exhibited significantly impaired OS compared with patients with normal S100B<GPE> ( 1-year OS: 51.1 % vs 83.1 %, log-rank P<ORGANIZATION> < .0001 ) and normal LDH<ORGANIZATION> ( 1-year OS: 44.4 % vs 80.8 %, P<PERSON> = .00022 ), respectively. LDH<ORGANIZATION> increases of > 25 % and S100B<GPE> increases of > 145 % compared to baseline were significantly associated with impaired OS ( both P < .0001 ). In patients treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab, baseline S100B<PERSON> and increasing S100B<GPE> levels of > 145 % as well as baseline LDH<ORGANIZATION> were associated with impaired OS ( P<PERSON> < .0001, P<PERSON> = .00060, and P<PERSON> = .0050, respectively ), whereas increasing LDH<ORGANIZATION> of > 25 % was not ( P<PERSON> = .64 ). S100B<PERSON> could serve as a strong baseline marker for OS in melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. Rising S100B<GPE> levels during the first weeks of therapy could help guide treatment decisions.
