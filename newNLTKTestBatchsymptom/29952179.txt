 It is unknown whether a concentrated period of small-sided games and high intensity training is an effective training approach in youth soccer players. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of a concentrated period of soccer specific training on physical fitness in youth players. Nineteen male soccer players, from two teams, participated ( mean ± SD age: 16.2 ± 0.8 years ; body mass: 58.2 ± 7.6 kg ; height: 170.8 ± 7.7 cm ). One team performed 5 days of small-sided games and high intensity training ( SSG<ORGANIZATION> & HIT<ORGANIZATION> ; n = 12 ) and the other team regular soccer training with 1 day of SSG<ORGANIZATION> and HIT<ORGANIZATION> ( REG<ORGANIZATION> ; n = 7 ) weekly for 4 weeks. The 30-15 intermittent fitness test ( 30-15 IFT ), countermovement jump ( CMJ<ORGANIZATION> ) and change of direction ( COD<ORGANIZATION> ) performance were measured pre and post intervention. Heart rate ( HR ) and rating of perceived exertion ( RPE<ORGANIZATION> ) were recorded and session load calculated ( RPE<ORGANIZATION> x minutes ). Average % of maximum HR and session load were 83 % and 344 AU for the SSG<ORGANIZATION> & HIT<ORGANIZATION> vs 73 % and 253 AU for the REG<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). 30-15 IFT<ORGANIZATION> improved for the SSG<ORGANIZATION> & HIT<ORGANIZATION> ( from 17.0 ± 1.1 to 18.4 ± 0.8 km/h ; p < 0.05 ; ES<ORGANIZATION> = 0.57 ) with no difference for the REG<ORGANIZATION> group ( Pre: 17.9 ± 1.3, Post<PERSON>: 18.2 ± 1.6 km/h, ES= 0.10 ). CMJ<ORGANIZATION> and COD<ORGANIZATION> were unchanged in both groups and no injuries were reported. A 4-week concentrated period of daily SSG<ORGANIZATION> & HIT<ORGANIZATION> is effective for improving endurance performance in youth soccer players. This was without injuries and without negating performance in power and change of direction.
