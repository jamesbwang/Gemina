 Sensory information gained through interoceptive awareness may play an important role in affective behavior and successful inhibition of drug use. This study examined the immediate pre-post effects of the mind-body intervention Mindful Awareness<PERSON> in Body-oriented Therapy ( MABT<ORGANIZATION> ) as an adjunct to women 's substance use disorder ( SUD<ORGANIZATION> ) treatment. MABT<ORGANIZATION> teaches interoceptive awareness skills to promote self-care and emotion regulation. Women in intensive outpatient treatment ( IOP<ORGANIZATION> ) for chemical dependency ( N =217 ) at three community clinics in the Pacific<ORGANIZATION> NW of the United States<GPE> were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three study conditions: MABT<ORGANIZATION> + Treatment as Usual<GPE> ( TAU<ORGANIZATION> ), Women<PERSON> 's Health Education<PERSON> ( WHE<ORGANIZATION> ) +TAU ( active control condition ), and TAU<ORGANIZATION> only. At baseline and three months post-intervention, assessments were made of interoceptive awareness skills and mindfulness, emotion regulation ( self-report and psychophysiological measures ), symptomatic distress ( depression and trauma-related symptoms ), and substance use ( days abstinent ) and craving. Changes in outcomes across time were assessed using multilevel mixed effects linear regression. Findings based on an intent-to-treat approach demonstrated significant improvements in interoceptive awareness and mindfulness skills, emotion dysregulation ( self-report and psychophysiology ), and days abstinent for women who received MABT<ORGANIZATION> compared to the other study groups. Additional analyses based on participants who completed the major components of MABT<ORGANIZATION> ( at least 75 % of the intervention sessions ) revealed these same improvements as well as reductions in depressive symptoms and substance craving. Findings that interoceptive training is associated with health outcomes for women in SUD<ORGANIZATION> treatment are consistent with emerging neurocognitive models that link interoception to emotion regulation and to related health outcomes, providing knowledge critical to supporting and improving SUD<ORGANIZATION> treatment.
