 To investigate the mechanism of action and consistency in flow characteristics of the Ahmed<ORGANIZATION> glaucoma valve ( AGV<ORGANIZATION> ) under simulated physiological conditions in-vitro and to evaluate whether resistance during priming has any effect on performance of the device. Each newly opened AGV<ORGANIZATION> device was connected to a digital manometer and was primed with normal saline. The device was then placed in a saline bath and connected to an open manometer, a digital manometer, and an infusion pump. Saline<PERSON> was infused at a rate of 3 μL/min for 24 hours. Digital<ORGANIZATION> manometer readings were recorded at 4 Hz. Data<PERSON> obtained from 9 devices are presented as medians ( ranges ). The priming pressure was 1130 ( 835, 1625 ) mm Hg. Pressure versus time curves showed two distinct phases ; transient and steady phases. The transient phase peak pressure was 24 ( 13, 45 ) mm Hg. In the steady phase, opening and closing pressures were 13 ( 10, 17 ) and 7 ( 4, 9 ) mm Hg, respectively ; the valve leaflets briefly opened every 73.9 ( 51, 76.6 ) minutes and the fluctuation of pressure ( difference between opening and closing pressures ) was 6 ( 3, 9 ) mm Hg. The Spearman<ORGANIZATION> correlation coefficient between priming and opening and priming and closing pressure was ρ = -0.13 ( The device showed functionality like a valve. The resistance during priming did not affect opening and closing pressures of the AGV<ORGANIZATION>. This study showed variable in vitro performance of the AGV<ORGANIZATION>. These laboratory findings might, at least partly, explain the variability in the clinical outcome of the device.
