 Intelligent tutor systems ( ITSs<ORGANIZATION> ) in mobile devices take us through learning tasks and make learning ubiquitous, autonomous, and at low cost ( Nye<ORGANIZATION>, 2015 ). In this paper, we describe guided embodiment as an ITS essential feature for second language learning ( L2 ) and aphasia rehabilitation ( ARe<ORGANIZATION> ) that enhances efficiency in the learning process. In embodiment, cognitive processes, here specifically language ( re ) learning are grounded in actions and gestures ( Pecher<PERSON> and Zwaan<PERSON>, 2005 ; Fischer<PERSON> and Zwaan<PERSON>, 2008 ; Dijkstra<PERSON> and Post<PERSON>, 2015 ). In order to guide users through embodiment, ITSs<ORGANIZATION> must track action and gesture, and give corrective feed-back to achieve the users ' goals. Therefore, sensor systems are essential to guided embodiment. In the next sections, we describe sensor systems that can be implemented in ITS<ORGANIZATION> for guided embodiment.
