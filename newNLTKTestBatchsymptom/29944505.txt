 To determine whether silicone hydrogel ( SH ) contact lens ( CL ) use, with or without meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD<ORGANIZATION> ), promotes ocular surface inflammation. Subjects wearing SH-CL for at least 6 months who also had coexisting MGD<ORGANIZATION> ( group 1, n=20 ), SH-CL users who did not have MGD<ORGANIZATION> ( group 2, n=20 ), patients who had MGD<ORGANIZATION> but did not use CL ( group 3, n=20 ), and healthy CL-naive individuals with no known systemic or ocular diseases ( group 4, n=20 ) were included in this cross-sectional, single-center study. All subjects underwent tear function tests consisting of tear break-up time ( tBUT<ORGANIZATION> ), ocular surface staining, Schirmer<GPE> test, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index<ORGANIZATION> ( OSDI<ORGANIZATION> ) questionnaire, as well as determination of tear IL-1RA, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IFN-α, IFN-γ, TNF-α, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IP-10, monokine induced by gamma interferon, RANTES<ORGANIZATION>, eotaxin, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-1 levels using Luminex<PERSON> multicytokine immunobead assay. Intergroup<ORGANIZATION> comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test. The tBUT<ORGANIZATION> was lower ( P=0.048 ) and ocular surface staining ( P=0.032 ) as well as OSDI<ORGANIZATION> scores ( P=0.001 ) were higher in group 1 but not in groups 2 or 3 when compared with those in the control group. Tear cytokine levels were similar across all groups. None of the tear cytokine levels were elevated in CL wearers ( groups 1 and 2 ) or those with MGD<ORGANIZATION> ( groups 1 and 3 ) as compared to those in control subjects. Silicone<PERSON> hydrogel contact lens use with concomitant MGD<ORGANIZATION> is not associated with cytokine-driven ocular surface inflammation but may impact tear function leading to dry eye symptoms.
