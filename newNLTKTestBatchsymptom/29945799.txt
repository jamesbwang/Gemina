 To compare cataract surgery with implantation of a Schlemm canal microstent with cataract surgery alone for the reduction of intraocular pressure ( IOP<ORGANIZATION> ) and medication use after 24 months. Prospective, multicenter, single-masked, randomized controlled trial. Subjects with concomitant primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG<ORGANIZATION> ), visually significant cataract, and washed-out modified diurnal IOP<ORGANIZATION> ( MDIOP<ORGANIZATION> ) between 22 and 34 mmHg. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive a single Hydrus Microstent<ORGANIZATION> ( Ivantis<PERSON>, Inc<PERSON>, Irvine<GPE>, CA ) in the Schlemm<ORGANIZATION> canal or no stent after uncomplicated phacoemulsification. Comprehensive eye examinations were conducted 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. Medication washout and MDIOP<ORGANIZATION> measurement were repeated at 12 and 24 months. The primary and secondary effectiveness end points were the proportion of subjects demonstrating a 20 % or greater reduction in unmedicated MDIOP<ORGANIZATION> and change in mean MDIOP from baseline at 24 months, respectively. Hypotensive medication use was tracked throughout the course of follow-up. Safety measures included the frequency of surgical complications and adverse events. A total of 369 eyes were randomized after phacoemulsification to Hydrus Microstent<PERSON> ( HMS<ORGANIZATION> ) and 187 to no microstent ( NMS<ORGANIZATION> ). At 24 months, unmedicated MDIOP<ORGANIZATION> was reduced by ≥20 % in 77.3 % of HMS<ORGANIZATION> group eyes and in 57.8 % of NMS<ORGANIZATION> group eyes ( difference = 19.5 %, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 11.2 % -27.8 %, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). The mean reduction in 24-month unmedicated MDIOP<ORGANIZATION> was -7.6±4.1 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> ( mean ± standard deviation ) in the HMS<ORGANIZATION> group and -5.3±3.9 mmHg in the NMS<ORGANIZATION> group ( difference = -2.3 mmHg ; 95 % CI, -3.0 to -1.6 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). The mean number of medications was reduced from 1.7±0.9 at baseline to 0.3±0.8 at 24 months in the HMS<ORGANIZATION> group and from 1.7±0.9 to 0.7±0.9 in the NMS<ORGANIZATION> group ( difference = -0.4 medications ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). There were no serious ocular adverse events related to the microstent, and no significant differences in safety parameters between the 2 groups. This 24-month multicenter randomized controlled trial demonstrated superior reduction in MDIOP<ORGANIZATION> and medication use among subjects with mild-to-moderate POAG who received a Schlemm canal microstent combined with phacoemulsification compared with phacoemulsification alone.
