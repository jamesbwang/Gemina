 Despite the challenge to directly target mutant KRAS<ORGANIZATION> due to its high GTP<ORGANIZATION> affinity, some agents are under development against downstream signaling pathways, such as MEK<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors. However, it remains controversial whether MEK<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors can boost current chemotherapy in KRAS-mutant lung tumors in clinic. Considering the genomic heterogeneity among lung cancer patients, it is valuable to test potential therapeutics in KRAS-mutation driven mouse models. We first compared the pERK1/2 level in lung cancer samples with different KRAS<ORGANIZATION> substitutions and generated a new genetically engineered mouse model whose tumor was driven by KRAS G12C<ORGANIZATION>, the most common KRAS<ORGANIZATION> mutation in lung cancer. Next, we evaluated the efficacy of selumetinib or its combination with chemotherapy, in KRAS G12C<ORGANIZATION> tumors compared to KRAS G12D<ORGANIZATION> tumors. Moreover, we generated KRAS<ORGANIZATION> G12C/p53 R270H model to explore the role of a dominant negative p53 mutation detected in patients in responsiveness to MEK<ORGANIZATION> inhibition. We determined higher pERK1/2 in KRAS G12C<ORGANIZATION> lung tumors compared to KRAS G12D<ORGANIZATION>. Using mouse models, we further identified that KRAS G12C<ORGANIZATION> tumors are significantly more sensitive to selumetinib compared with Kras G12D<PERSON> tumors. MEK<ORGANIZATION> inhibition significantly increased chemotherapeutic efficacy and progression-free survival of KRAS G12C<ORGANIZATION> mice. Interestingly, p53 co-mutation rendered KRAS G12C<ORGANIZATION> lung tumors less sensitive to combination treatment with selumetinib and chemotherapy. Our data demonstrate that unique KRAS<ORGANIZATION> mutations and concurrent mutations in tumor-suppressor genes are important factors for lung tumor responses to MEK<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor. Our preclinical study supports further clinical evaluation of combined MEK<ORGANIZATION> inhibition and chemotherapy for lung cancer patients harboring KRAS G12C<ORGANIZATION> and wildtype p53 status.
