 Acute<GPE> cerebral injuries, such as cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic events, have been repeatedly correlated with sudden electrocardiogram ( ECG<ORGANIZATION> ) changes, such as cardiac arrhythmias, QT<ORGANIZATION> prolongation, and T-wave inversion ( the `` cerebral T-wave '' ). Injuries to the insular cortex have been reported in the literature to result in such changes, possibly due to increased sympathetic tone to the cardiac system. A 65-year-old gentleman presented with an acute right middle cerebral artery territory infarction, and was found to have ECG<ORGANIZATION> abnormalities and left ventricular dysfunction, which improved after the acute phase of the stroke. Acute<PERSON> ischemic infarcts, particularly to the right insular cortex, can result in ECG<ORGANIZATION> abnormalities, such as QT<ORGANIZATION> prolongation and T-wave inversion, as well as acute systolic heart failure ; all of which may be reversible after the acute phase of the stroke.
