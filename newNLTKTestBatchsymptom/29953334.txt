 Pantoea<GPE> ananatis, a cause of center rot of onion, is problematic in the USA<ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere. The bacterium lacks disease determinants common to most other bacterial pathogens of plants. A genomic island containing the gene pepM<ORGANIZATION> was detected within many onion-pathogenic strains of P. ananatis of diverse origins. The pepM<ORGANIZATION> gene of P. ananatis putatively encodes a protein that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate, the first step in the biosynthesis of phosphonates and related molecules. This gene appears to be essential for center rot disease. Deletion of pepM<ORGANIZATION> rendered the mutant strain unable to cause lesions in leaves of growing onions and water-soaking of inoculated yellow onion bulbs. Furthermore, growth of the deletion mutant in onion leaves was significantly diminished compared to wild-type bacteria, and the mutant failed to cause cell death in tobacco. Complementation of the mutated strain with pepM<ORGANIZATION> restored the phenotype to wild-type capability. The pepM<ORGANIZATION> gene is the first pathogenicity gene identified that affects bacterial fitness as well as symptom development in both leaves and bulbs in a pathogen causing center rot of onion.
