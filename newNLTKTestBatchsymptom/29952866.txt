Immune response related with skin thermal pattern in judokas: A new application for infrared thermography ? J Strength Cond Res XX ( X ): 000-000, 2018-This study investigated the association between body skin temperature ( BST<ORGANIZATION> ) and immune response after judo training, and compared the immune responses considering 2 post-training skin thermal pattern ( `` spots '' -SPT and `` localized '' -LOC ). For this, we evaluated 32 ( 25-male ) black-belt judokas from the Spanish Junior National Team<ORGANIZATION> ( 18.0 ± 3.5 years, 72.4 ± 18.4 kg, and 17.1 ± 7.5 % body fat ). White<PERSON> blood cell and BST<ORGANIZATION> measurements were performed at pre-training, immediately, 1, and 24-hour post-training. Body skin temperature ( ° C ) was estimated by skin temperature from 4 regions of interest ( chest, upper arm, thigh, and calf ). The main results indicated that 13 judokas were classified as SPT<ORGANIZATION> and 19 as LOC<ORGANIZATION>. In comparison with LOC<ORGANIZATION>, SPT<ORGANIZATION> had a significantly lower BST<ORGANIZATION> post-training ( SPT<ORGANIZATION> = 33.0 ± 0.4 vs. LOC<ORGANIZATION> = 33.6 ± 0.8° C ; p = 0.016 ), lower blood concentration of leukocytes ( SPT<ORGANIZATION> = 7.9 ± 1.9 vs. LOC<ORGANIZATION> = 8.9 ± 1.9 cells × 10 per mm ; p ≤ 0.001 ), and neutrophils ( SPT<ORGANIZATION> = 5.5 ± 1.7 vs. LOC<ORGANIZATION> = 6.1 ± 2.2 cells × 10 per mm ; p ≤ 0.001 ). In conclusion, the BST<ORGANIZATION> and immune response after judo training seem to be not associated. However, when the skin thermal pattern is considered, the SPT<ORGANIZATION> skin thermal pattern presented a lower post-training BST<ORGANIZATION>, blood leukocytes, and neutrophils in comparison with the LOC<ORGANIZATION> group. These results show a possible relationship between skin thermal pattern and immune responses for the first time ; however, further studies are needed to confirm the evidence presented here.
