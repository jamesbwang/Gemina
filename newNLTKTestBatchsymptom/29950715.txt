 The aim of this study was to determine CT risk findings predictive of temporary neurological dysfunction ( TND<ORGANIZATION> ) and permanent neurological dysfunction ( PND<ORGANIZATION> ) after surgical repair for acute type A aortic dissection ( ATAAD<ORGANIZATION> ). A total of 255 patients ( 41 Â± 16 years, 79 % male ) with ATAAD<ORGANIZATION> underwent aortic CT angiography ( CTA<ORGANIZATION> ) and surgical repair consecutively from January 2013 to June 2016. The CTA<ORGANIZATION> findings of the 255 patients for the thoracic aorta and carotid artery were analysed to identify risk factors predictive of TND<ORGANIZATION> and PND<ORGANIZATION>. Thirty-eight patients ( 15 % ) suffered TND<ORGANIZATION>, and 18 ( 7 % ) exhibited PND<ORGANIZATION>. Common<ORGANIZATION> carotid artery ( CCA<ORGANIZATION> ) dissection ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 4.63 ), lower enhancement of unilateral ICA<ORGANIZATION> ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 3.02 ) and aortic arch tears ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 2.83 ) were predictors of postoperative TND<ORGANIZATION>, while PND<ORGANIZATION> was best predicted by retrograde ascending aorta ( aAO<ORGANIZATION> ) dissection ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 5.62 ) and aortic arch tears ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 6.74 ). In CCA<ORGANIZATION> dissection, the extent of the entire CCA<ORGANIZATION> and proximal ICA<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> = 0.014 ), a low-enhancement false lumen with re-entry ( P<PERSON> = 0.000 ) and a severely narrowed true lumen without re-entry ( P<PERSON> = 0.005 ) significantly increased the risk of postoperative TND<ORGANIZATION>. In patients with ATAAD<ORGANIZATION>, specific CT findings allow the individual risk of postoperative TND<ORGANIZATION> and PND<ORGANIZATION> to be identified and may guide subsequent surgical management.
