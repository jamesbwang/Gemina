 Carbohydrates are appealing non-ionic surfactant head-groups as they are naturally abundant, generally biocompatible and biodegradable, and readily functionalized. Here, seven novel carbohydrate based surfactants ( CBS<ORGANIZATION> ) have been synthesized that contain a tri-ethylene glycol ( TEG<ORGANIZATION> ) linker between a glucose head-group and alkyl tail-group, with linear saturated ( C8-18 ) and unsaturated ( C18:1 ) alkyl chains. The aqueous adsorption and self-assembly of these surfactants was explored using tensiometry and small- and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering ( SANS<ORGANIZATION> and USANS ). With SANS we observed elongation from spherical to cylindrical micelles with increasing alkyl chain length. C16<PERSON> and C18<ORGANIZATION> chains exhibited pronounced Krafft<ORGANIZATION> points, yet formed worm-like micelles as single components upon heating to 43 and 48 °C respectively. The introduction of mono-unsaturation in the form of a C18:1 chain reduced the Krafft<ORGANIZATION> point and gave a surfactant that produced worm-like micelles in water without additives at room temperature. We also observed micellar elongation for C12<ORGANIZATION> and C14<ORGANIZATION> chains at 50 °C due to dehydration of the TEG<ORGANIZATION> linker. The room temperature worm-like micelles were further characterized using rheo-SANS and rheology, revealing the C18:1 surfactant to exhibit near ideal Maxwell<PERSON> behavior at low concentrations ( 2.9 wt. % ). These results provide insight into structure-function relationships for CBS<ORGANIZATION>, and demonstrate a promising molecular candidate for the formation of viscoelastic worm-like micellar solutions.
