 This study examined the effects of public hospitals ' privatization on financial performance. We used a sample of nonfederal acute care public hospitals from 1997 to 2013, averaging 434 hospitals per year. Privatization was defined as conversion from public status to either private not-for-profit ( NFP<ORGANIZATION> ) or private for-profit ( FP ) status. Financial performance was measured by operating margin ( OM ) and total margin ( TM ). We used hospital level and year fixed effects linear panel regressions with nonlagged independent and control variables ( Model 1 ), lagged by 1 year ( Model 2 ), and lagged by 2 years ( Model 3 ). Privatization to FP<ORGANIZATION> was associated with 17 % higher OM ( Model 2 ) and 9 % higher OM ( Model 3 ), compared with 3 %, 4 %, and 6 % higher OM for privatization to NFP<ORGANIZATION> for all three Models<GPE>, respectively. Privatization to FP<ORGANIZATION> was associated with 7 % higher TM ( Model 2 ) and privatization to NFP<ORGANIZATION> was associated with 2 % higher TM ( Model 3 ).
