 Electronic<GPE> health records ( EHR<ORGANIZATION> ) might be a useful resource to study the risk factors and clinical care of people with dementia. We sought to determine the diagnostic validity of dementia captured in linked EHR<ORGANIZATION>. A cohort of adults in linked primary care, hospital, disease registry and mortality records in England<GPE>, [ CALIBER ( CArdiovascular<ORGANIZATION> disease research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic<ORGANIZATION> health Records ) ]. The proportion of individuals with dementia, Alzheimer<PERSON> 's disease, vascular and rare dementia in each data source was determined. A comparison was made of symptoms and care between people with dementia and age-, sex- and general practice-matched controls, using conditional logistic regression. The lifetime risk and prevalence of dementia and mortality rates in people with and without dementia were estimated with random-effects Poisson<PERSON> models. There were 47,386 people with dementia: 12,633 with Alzheimer<PERSON> 's disease, 9540 with vascular and 1539 with rare dementia. Seventy-four percent of cases had corroborating evidence of dementia. People with dementia were more likely to live in a deprived area ( conditional OR 1.26 ; 95 % CI:1.20-1.31 most vs least deprived ), have documented memory impairment ( cOR<ORGANIZATION> = 11.97 ; 95 % CI:11.24-12.75 ), falls ( cOR<ORGANIZATION> = 2.36 ; 95 % CI:2.31-2.41 ), depression ( cOR<ORGANIZATION> = 2.03 ; 95 % CI:1.98-2.09 ) or anxiety ( cOR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.27 ; 95 % CI:1.23-1.32 ). The lifetime risk of dementia at age 65 was 9.2 % ( 95 % CI:9.0 % -9.4 % ), in men and 14.9 % ( 95 % CI:14.7 % -15.1 % ) in women. The population prevalence of recorded dementia increased from 0.3 % in 2000 to 0.7 % in 2010. A higher mortality rate was observed in people with than without dementia ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.56 ; 95 % CI:1.54-1.58 ). Most people with a record of dementia in linked UK<ORGANIZATION> EHR had some corroborating evidence for diagnosis. The estimated 10-year risk of dementia was higher than published population-based estimations. EHR are therefore a promising source of data for dementia research.
