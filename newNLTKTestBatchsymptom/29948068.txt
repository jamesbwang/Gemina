 To retrospectively review the radiological and clinicopathological features of gliosarcoma ( GSM<ORGANIZATION> ) and differentiate it from glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM<ORGANIZATION> ). The clinicopathological data and imaging findings ( including VASARI<ORGANIZATION> analysis ) of 48 surgically and pathologically confirmed GSM<ORGANIZATION> patients ( group 1 ) were reviewed in detail, and were compared with that of other glioblastoma ( GBM<ORGANIZATION> ) cases in our hospital ( group 2 ). There were 28 men and 20 women GSM<ORGANIZATION> patients with a median age of 52.5 years ( range, 24-80 years ) in this study. Haemorrhage ( n = 21 ), a salt-and-pepper sign on T2-weighted images ( n = 36 ), unevenly thickened wall ( n = 36 ) even appearing as a paliform pattern ( n = 32 ), an intra-tumoural large feeding artery ( n = 32 ) and an eccentric cystic portion ( ECP<ORGANIZATION> ) ( n = 19 ) were more commonly observed in the GSM<ORGANIZATION> group than in GBM<ORGANIZATION> patients. Based on our experience, GSM<ORGANIZATION> can be divided into four subtypes according to magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) features. When compared to GBM<ORGANIZATION> ( group 2 ), there were more patients designated with type III<ORGANIZATION> lesions ( having very unevenly thickened walls ) and IV<ORGANIZATION> ( solid ) lesions among the GSM<ORGANIZATION> cases ( group 1 ). On univariate prognostic analysis, adjuvant therapy ( radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiochemotherapy ) and existence of an eccentric cyst region were prognostic factors. However, Cox<PERSON> 's regression model showed only adjuvant therapy as a prognostic factor for GSM<ORGANIZATION>. When compared to GBM<ORGANIZATION>, certain imaging features are more likely to occur in GSM<ORGANIZATION>, which may help raise the possibility of this disease. All GSM patients are recommended to receive adjuvant therapy to achieve a better prognosis with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy all as options. • Diagnosis of gliosarcoma can be suggested preoperatively by imaging. • Gliosarcoma can be divided into four subtypes based on MRI<ORGANIZATION>. • Paliform<GPE> pattern and ECP<ORGANIZATION> tend to present in gliosarcoma more than GBM<ORGANIZATION>. • The cystic subtype of gliosarcoma may predict a more dismal prognosis. • All gliosarcoma patients should receive adjuvant therapy to achieve better prognosis.
