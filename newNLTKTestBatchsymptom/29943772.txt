 Malnutrition<GPE> and muscle wasting are common features of cancer cachexia that may interfere with the patient 's response to cancer treatment, survival, and quality of life. An accurate nutritional screening at the time of diagnosis and throughout the patient 's treatment fosters better control of the disease. Several screening tools have proven to be useful for this purpose. Nevertheless, nutritional evaluation is not a routine practice in this clinical setting and procedures must be standardized. Nutritional risk screening ( NRS<ORGANIZATION> ), malnutrition screening tool ( MST<ORGANIZATION> ), and patient-generated subjective global assessment ( PG-SGA ) are the most common screening tools, and each one possesses some benefits when screening patients for malnutrition ; however, weight loss over a specific time period, dietary intake and anorexia must also be considered. The body mass index-adjusted weight loss grading system predicts survival. We recommend the application of MST<ORGANIZATION> or NRS<ORGANIZATION>, followed by PG-SGA, food intake determination, measurement of body weight, and its changes as well as body composition, biochemical nutritional markers, muscle function, and physical performance.
