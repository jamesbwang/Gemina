 Intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH<ORGANIZATION> ) causes blood-brain barrier ( BBB<ORGANIZATION> ) damage along with altered element levels in the brain. BBB<ORGANIZATION> permeability was quantified at 3, 7, and 14 days with Evans Blue<PERSON> dye after collagenase-induced ICH in rat. At peak permeability ( day 3 ), a gadolinium ( Gd ) -based contrast agent was injected to further characterize BBB<ORGANIZATION> disruption, and X-ray fluorescence imaging ( XFI<ORGANIZATION> ) was used to map Gd, Fe<GPE>, Cl<GPE>, and other elements. XFI revealed that Ca<GPE>, Cl<GPE>, Gd<GPE>, and Fe concentrations were significantly elevated, whereas K was significantly decreased. Therefore, using Gd-XFI, we co-determined BBB<ORGANIZATION> dysfunction with alterations in the metallome, including those that contribute to cell death and functional outcome. Warfarin<PERSON> was administered 3 days post-ICH to investigate whether additional or new bleeding occurs during peak BBB<ORGANIZATION> dysfunction, and hematoma volume was assessed on day 4. Warfarin<PERSON> administration prolonged bleeding time after a peripheral cut-induced bleed, but warfarin did not worsen hematoma volume. Accordingly, extensive BBB<ORGANIZATION> leakage occurred after ICH<ORGANIZATION>, but did not appear to affect total hematoma size.
