 The control of postoperative bleeding represents one of the main intercurrent events associated with soft tissue surgical procedures in the oral cavity. In this context, platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF<ORGANIZATION> ) membranes are materials with great potential for optimizing soft tissue healing and induction of hemostasis. This interventional case series describes the treatment of 10 patients with excisional biopsy of benign oral cavity lesions, following a screening sequence at the surgery clinic of a Brazilian<GPE> dental school between the years of 2015 and 2017. After treatment with PRF<ORGANIZATION>, patients presented mean time for postoperative hemostasis of 10.3 Â± 2.5 s, requiring the average use of three membranes to cover the surgical area. The results suggest that the use of platelet-rich fibrin membranes may represent a feasible alternative hemostatic material for the treatment of oral lesions.
