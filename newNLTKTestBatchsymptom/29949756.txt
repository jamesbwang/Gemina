 Mitochondria are composed of many small proteins that control protein synthesis, complex assembly, metabolism, and ion and reactive oxygen species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ) handling. We show that a skeletal muscle- and heart-enriched long non-coding RNA<ORGANIZATION>, LINC00116<ORGANIZATION>, encodes a highly conserved 56-amino-acid microprotein that we named mitoregulin ( Mtln<ORGANIZATION> ). Mtln<PERSON> localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it binds cardiolipin and influences protein complex assembly. In cultured cells, Mtln<GPE> overexpression increases mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration rates, and Ca
