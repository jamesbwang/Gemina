 We report the preparation of hierarchical porous carbon sponges ( HCS<ORGANIZATION> ) from metal oxide nanoparticle @ metal-organic frameworks. ZnO<ORGANIZATION> nanoparticles are partially converted to zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 ( ZIF-8 ) crystals in presence of n-butylamine, obtaining ZnO<ORGANIZATION> @ ZIF-8 porous hybrids. After direct carbonization, followed by ZnO<ORGANIZATION> acidic etching, ZnO<ORGANIZATION> @ ZIF-8 crystals were converted to submicrometric HCS<ORGANIZATION>. Due<PERSON> to the high surface area and accessible porosity combining micro- and mesoporosity of HCS<ORGANIZATION>, their application for the extraction of water pollutants was studied preparing HCS/polymer membranes, showing a high efficiency for the fast ( 650 L m-2 h-1 ) removal of plastic degradation by-products ( DBP<ORGANIZATION>, dibutyl phthalate. DEHP<ORGANIZATION>, bis ( 2-n-ehtylhexyl ) phthalate ). DBP<ORGANIZATION> and DEHP<ORGANIZATION> breakthroughs were lower than 3 % after the filtration of 100 mL of water containing simultaneously both phthalates at a high concentration level ( 300 Âµg L-1, each ). HCS/polymer membranes were reusable up to 5 times maintaining their extraction capacity, with relative errors of 6 % for DBP<ORGANIZATION>, and < 1 % for DEHP<ORGANIZATION>.
