 Poor<GPE> athlete buy-in and adherence to training monitoring systems ( TMS<ORGANIZATION> ) can be problematic in elite sport. This is a significant issue, as failure to record, interpret, and respond appropriately to negative changes in athlete wellbeing and training status may result in undesirable consequences, such as maladaptation and/or underperformance. This study examined the perceptions of elite athletes to their TMS<ORGANIZATION>, and their primary reasons for non-completion. Nine<PERSON> national team sprint athletes participated in semi-structured interviews on their perceptions of their TMS. Interview data was analysed qualitatively, based on grounded theory, and TMS<ORGANIZATION> adherence information was collected. Thematic analysis showed that athletes reported their main reason for poor buy-in to TMS<ORGANIZATION> was a lack of feedback on their monitoring data from key staff. Further<PERSON>, training modifications made in response to meaningful changes in monitoring data were sometimes perceived to be disproportionate, resulting in dishonest reporting practices. Perceptions of opaque or unfair decision-making on training programme modifications and insufficient feedback were the primary causes for poor athlete TMS<ORGANIZATION> adherence. Supporting TMS<ORGANIZATION> implementation with a behavioural change model that targets problem areas could improve buy-in and enable limited resources to be appropriately directed.
