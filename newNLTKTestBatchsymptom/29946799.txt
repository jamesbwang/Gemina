 The BURDEN<ORGANIZATION> IBS-C study was conducted to better understand the experiences, attitudes, and unmet needs of sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation ( IBS-C ) in comparison to the perceptions and challenges of healthcare providers ( HCPs<ORGANIZATION> ) who treat IBS-C patients. This was an author-developed, online questionnaire using KnowledgePanel<ORGANIZATION> Most patients had used ( 86 % ) and/or were using ( 76 % ) over-the-counter treatments for their IBS-C, with 12 % currently on prescription therapy. At the time this study was conducted, 66 % and 63 % were not satisfied/completely satisfied with over-the-counter or prescription treatment, respectively, citing inadequate efficacy ( 55 % ) and side effects ( 39 % ), most commonly diarrhea, as common reasons for dissatisfaction. IBS-C respondents most commonly reported feeling frustrated ( 43 % ) and stressed ( 28 % ) regarding IBS-C, though 39 % were accepting of IBS-C as part of daily life. HCPs were aligned with patients in thinking that patients were frustrated ( 76 % ) and stressed ( 65 % ) but HCPs<ORGANIZATION> were less likely to recognize that patients had become accepting of their IBS-C ( 13 % ). Most HCPs ( 79 % ) were not satisfied/completely satisfied with the prescription treatments available at the time this study was conducted. Inadequate<ORGANIZATION> response rates to current therapies ( 55 % ) and treatment adherence/compliance issues ( 58 % ) were the most frequent challenges encountered by HCPs<ORGANIZATION>. IBS-C respondents reported that their symptoms impacted productivity and personal activity, on average, 4 and 3 days/month, respectively. These results suggest that current management pathways may not be adequately addressing the symptoms and needs of individuals with IBS-C, most notably side effects and lack of efficacy. Patients and HCPs<ORGANIZATION> expressed dissatisfaction with over-the-counter and prescription treatments available at the time this study was conducted. Additional treatment options and improved dialogue would be beneficial to HCPs<ORGANIZATION> and patients. Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc<PERSON>.
