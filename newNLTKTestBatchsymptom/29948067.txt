 Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures ( OVCFs<ORGANIZATION> ) are an important health issue for which minimally invasive techniques are a feasible treatment. The SpineJack® ( Vexim ) is an intravertebral expandable system designed to improve the correction of the structural modifications caused by OVCFs<ORGANIZATION>. Its ability to stabilise and reduce OVCFs<ORGANIZATION> at the acute phase being already well established, we sought to evaluate the feasibility of vertebral augmentation with the SpineJack® in chronic kyphotic OVCFs<ORGANIZATION>. All consecutive patients treated with the SpineJack® were prospectively included if they met the following criteria: ( 1 ) OVCF<ORGANIZATION> considered unstable ( grade A3 according to Magerl<PERSON> 's classification ). ( 2 ) Local<ORGANIZATION> kyphotic angle ≥ 20°. ( 3 ) OVCF<ORGANIZATION> older than 6 weeks. ( 4 ) Back pain with visual analogue scale ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> ) ≥ 4. Nineteen consecutive patients ( 16 women [ 84.2 % ] and 3 men [ 15.8 % ] ; mean age 73.2 ± 8.2 years ) were included. Treatment<PERSON> was performed after a mean delay of 5.8 months ± 2.9 ( range 1.5-12 ). Median<GPE> visual analogue scale significantly improved from 7 preoperatively ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 6-9 ) to 2 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 1-5 ) at 6 months ( p < 0.01 ). Significant kyphosis reduction ( i.e. ≥ 30 % ) was obtained in 94.7 % of cases. Secondary adjacent level fractures ( SALFs<ORGANIZATION> ) were noted in 21.1 % of cases and were correlated with the importance of the kyphosis reduction. Vertebral augmentation with the SpineJack® is feasible and seems able to correct major structural deformities in chronic OVCFs<ORGANIZATION>. SALFs were noted in a substantial amount of cases. Preventive adjacent vertebroplasty might be useful in patients with several risk factors for SALFs<ORGANIZATION>. • Vertebral augmentation with SpineJack® is effective to correct major structural deformities e.g. height loss and kyphosis. • Successful reduction is reachable with SpineJack® in chronic ( older than 6 weeks ) OVCFs. • Aggressive reduction of major kyphosis might promote SALFs<ORGANIZATION> and complementary adjacent vertebroplasties prevent their occurrence.
