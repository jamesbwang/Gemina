 The mechanism, by which vitamin D influences inflammatory biomarkers in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM<ORGANIZATION> ), is not very well known. Thus, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on some inflammatory biomarkers in T2DM<ORGANIZATION> subjects. We searched randomized controlled trials from PubMed<ORGANIZATION> and the Cochrane<ORGANIZATION> Library in October 2017 and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ). Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to calculate pooled effects. We identified 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The results indicated that the vitamin D supplementation significant decreased the hs-CRP level by 0.45 μg/mL, whereas the vitamin D supplementation did not influence the TNF-α and IL-6. Subgroup<PERSON> analysis showed that vitamin D significantly lowered hs-CRP by 0.34 μg/mL among trials with a daily vitamin D dose ≤4,000 IU and by 0.31 μg/mL among trials with time of vitamin D supplementation > 12 weeks. Vitamin D<PERSON> supplementation is beneficial for the reduction of hs-CRP inT2DM<ORGANIZATION> subjects but does not have a significant influence on TNF-α and IL-6 in T2DM<ORGANIZATION> subjects.
