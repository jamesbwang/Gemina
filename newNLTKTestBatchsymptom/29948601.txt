 This review systematically identified and critically appraised the available literature that has examined the association between religiosity and/or spirituality ( R/S ) and quality of life ( QOL<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with cardiovascular disease ( CVD<ORGANIZATION> ). We searched several electronic online databases ( PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, SCOPUS<ORGANIZATION>, PsycINFO<ORGANIZATION>, and CINAHL<ORGANIZATION> ) from database inception until October 2017. Included articles were peer-reviewed, published in English<GPE>, and quantitatively examined the association between R/S and QOL<ORGANIZATION>. We assessed the methodological quality of each included study. The 15 articles included were published between 2002 and 2017. Most studies were conducted in the US<ORGANIZATION> and enrolled patients with heart failure. Sixteen dimensions of R/S were assessed with a variety of instruments. QOL<ORGANIZATION> domains examined were global, health-related, and disease-specific QOL<ORGANIZATION>. Ten studies reported a significant positive association between R/S and QOL<ORGANIZATION>, with higher spiritual well-being, intrinsic religiousness, and frequency of church attendance positively related with mental and emotional well-being. Approximately half of the included studies reported negative or null associations. Our findings suggest that higher levels of R/S may be related to better QOL<ORGANIZATION> among patients with CVD<ORGANIZATION>, with varying associations depending on the R/S dimension and QOL<ORGANIZATION> domain assessed. Future<PERSON> longitudinal studies in large patient samples with different CVDs<ORGANIZATION> and designs are needed to better understand how R/S may influence QOL<ORGANIZATION>. More uniformity in assessing R/S would enhance the comparability of results across studies. Understanding the influence of R/S on QOL<ORGANIZATION> would promote a holistic approach in managing patients with CVD<ORGANIZATION>.
