 The objective of this study was to identify features that impact the diagnostic performance of intermediate-delay washout CT for distinguishing malignant from benign adrenal lesions. This retrospective study evaluated 127 pathologically proven adrenal lesions ( 82 malignant, 45 benign ) in 126 patients who had undergone portal venous phase and intermediate-delay washout CT ( 1-3 minutes after portal venous phase ) with or without unenhanced images. Unenhanced images were available for 103 lesions. Quantitatively, lesion CT attenuation on unenhanced ( UA ) and delayed ( DL ) images, absolute and relative percentage of enhancement washout ( APEW<ORGANIZATION> and RPEW<ORGANIZATION>, respectively ), descriptive CT features ( lesion size, margin characteristics, heterogeneity or homogeneity, fat, calcification ), patient demographics, and medical history were evaluated for association with lesion status using multiple logistic regression with stepwise model selection. Area<PERSON> under the ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve ( A A When appropriately combined with other CT features, washout derived from intermediate-delay CT with or without additional clinical data has potential utility in differentiating malignant from benign adrenal lesions.
