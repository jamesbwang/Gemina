 Cancer<GPE> cells rely on the chaperone, heat shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ), for survival and proliferation. Recently, benzothiazole-rhodacyanines have been shown to bind an allosteric site on Hsp70<GPE>, interrupting its binding to nucleotide-exchange factors ( NEFs<ORGANIZATION> ) and promoting cell death in breast cancer cell lines. However, proof-of-concept molecules, such as JG-98, have relatively modest potency ( EC50<ORGANIZATION> ~0.7 to 0.4 µM ) and are rapidly metabolized in animals. Here, we explored this chemical series through structure- and property-based design of ~300 analogs, showing that the most potent had > 10-fold improved EC50<ORGANIZATION> values ( ~0.05 to 0.03 µM ) against two breast cancer cells. Biomarkers and whole genome CRISPRi<ORGANIZATION> screens confirmed members of the Hsp70<GPE> family as cellular targets. Based on these results, JG-231 was found to reduce tumor burden in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft model ( 4 mg/kg ; i.p. ). Together, these studies support the hypothesis that Hsp70<PERSON> may be a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics.
