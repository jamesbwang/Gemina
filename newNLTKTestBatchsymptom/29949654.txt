 The primary goal of this investigation is to determine the current national standards for time to treatment initiation ( TTI<ORGANIZATION> ) in soft tissue sarcoma ( STS<ORGANIZATION> ). Additionally, we aim to identify the variables affecting TTI<ORGANIZATION> variability in STS. An analysis of the National Cancer Database<ORGANIZATION> identified 41 529 patients diagnosed with STS<ORGANIZATION> between 2004 and 2013. Kruskall-Wallis tests identified differences between covariates regarding TTI<ORGANIZATION>. Negative binomial regression models identified variables that independently influenced TTI<ORGANIZATION>, and adjusted for confounders. The median TTI<ORGANIZATION> was 22.0 days and the mean TTI<ORGANIZATION> was 29.7 days. Longer TTI<PERSON> was correlated with transitions in care between institutions ( Incidence<ORGANIZATION> rate ratio [ IRR ] = 1.76 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), neoadjuvant radiotherapy ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.53 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), neoadjuvant systemic therapy ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.40 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), treatment at an academic center ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.23 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), Medicaid<GPE> ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.18 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), being uninsured ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.13 ; P<PERSON> = 0.001 ), and Medicare<GPE> ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.05 P = 0.016 ) status. Shorter TTI<PERSON> was correlated with tumor size > 5 cm ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.93 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), high grade ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.92 ; P<PERSON> = 0.015 ), truncal tumor site ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.94 ; P<PERSON> = 0.003 ), and median income > $ 63 000 ( IRR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.95 ; P<PERSON> = 0.028 ). The median TTI in the United States<GPE> for STS<ORGANIZATION> is 22 days. Increased TTI<ORGANIZATION> in STS are associated with tumor and treatment characteristics, socio-economic factors and hospital systems issues. Transitions in care between institutions are responsible for the greatest increases.
