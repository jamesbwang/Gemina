 Maximum<GPE> standard uptake value ( SUVmax<ORGANIZATION> ) of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography ( FDG-PET/CT ) is reportedly useful for evaluating regional lymph nodes ( RLNs<ORGANIZATION> ) of non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> ) to predict malignancy. However, it is difficult for clinicians to measure SUVmax<ORGANIZATION> ( mSUVmax<ORGANIZATION> ) as calculated by a workstation.We assessed the utility of simplified SUVmax<ORGANIZATION> ( sSUVmax<ORGANIZATION> ) in screening RLNs<ORGANIZATION> for pathologic malignancy. The highest color was visually defined in the region of interest. The resulting color can be quantified using the color bar, and interpreted as sSUVmax<ORGANIZATION>. Patients in respiratory medicine and surgery who underwent both contrast-enhanced CT and FDG-PET/CT within 3 months before radical lobectomy were evaluated retrospectively. The correlation was examined by regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve analyses.Participants comprised 69 patients with NSCLC<ORGANIZATION> treated between May 2009 and April 2016. Medical<ORGANIZATION> group comprised 22 patients from respiratory medicine. The prediction model could be written as a linear relationship ( mSUVmax<ORGANIZATION> = 1.019 Ã— sSUVmax ; R = 0.930 ). A total of 316 RLNs resected by surgery in total cohort were pathologically determined. From ROC<ORGANIZATION> curves, area under curve for sSUVmax<ORGANIZATION> was 0.72 ( 95 % confidence interval, 0.61-0.83 ; P<PERSON> < .0002 ). The cutoff sSUVmax<ORGANIZATION> was 2.42 ( sensitivity, 52 % ; specificity, 88 % ; accuracy, 85 % ) .The sSUVmax<ORGANIZATION> allows quantification of colors from FDG-PET/CT and shows a close correlation to mSUVmax. This value may have potential in screening for RLNs<ORGANIZATION>, and thoracic clinicians can readily determine the value. These findings may facilitate better planning of therapeutic strategy in the real world.
