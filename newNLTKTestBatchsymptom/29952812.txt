 Physical<GPE> inactivity and sedentary behavior ( SB ) are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. No studies appear to have investigated whether SB in cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) participants changes over time. The aim of this study was to objectively assess physical activity ( PA ) and SB<ORGANIZATION> of CR<ORGANIZATION> participants over 6 wks. Using a prospective cohort study design, 72 CR participants, age = 64.2 ± 9.6 y ( mean ± standard deviation [ SD ] ) ( 79 % male ), wore an ActiGraph<ORGANIZATION> ActiSleep accelerometer for 7 consecutive days at the beginning and end of a 6-wk program to assess daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA ( MVPA<ORGANIZATION> ) and SB<ORGANIZATION> ( < 100 counts/min ). Other outcomes collected were self-reported MVPA<ORGANIZATION> ( Active Australia<ORGANIZATION> Survey ) and SB<ORGANIZATION> ( Past-Day Adults<PERSON> ' Sedentary Time Questionnaire ), body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, lipid profile, blood glucose level, quality of life ( MacNew<ORGANIZATION> ), exercise capacity ( 6-min walk test ), anxiety and depression ( Hospital Anxiety<ORGANIZATION> and Depression Scale<ORGANIZATION> ). Time spent in MVPA<ORGANIZATION> and SB<ORGANIZATION> did not change over 6 wks. However, exercise capacity and light-intensity PA significantly improved ( P<PERSON> < .01 ). On average, participants spent 11.8 ± 1.1 hr daily in SB<GPE>, with 9.5 ± 14.7 min daily in MVPA<ORGANIZATION> at the end of the CR<ORGANIZATION> program. There was some evidence that males and females had different movement patterns. Levels<PERSON> of PA are low and SB<ORGANIZATION> is high in CR participants despite changes in exercise capacity over 6 wks. Participants in CR did increase their PA but only in the light-intensity range. Alternative approaches in CR should be considered to encourage participants to move more and sit less.
