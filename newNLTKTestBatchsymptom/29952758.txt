 To investigate the association between a limb ballistocardiogram ( BCG<ORGANIZATION> ) and blood pressure ( BP ) based on data mining. During four BP-perturbing interventions, the BCG<ORGANIZATION> and reference BP were measured from 23 young healthy volunteers using a custom-manufactured wristband equipped with a MEMS<ORGANIZATION> accelerometer and a commercial continuous BP measurement device. Both timing and amplitude features in the wrist BCG<ORGANIZATION> waveform were extracted, and significant features predictive of diastolic ( DP ) and systolic ( SP ) BP were selected using stepwise linear regression analysis. The selected features were further compressed using principal component analysis to yield a small set of DP<ORGANIZATION> and SP<ORGANIZATION> predictors. The association between the predictors thus obtained and BP<ORGANIZATION> was investigated by multivariate linear regression analysis. The predictors exhibited a meaningful association with BP<ORGANIZATION>. When three most significant predictors were used for DP<ORGANIZATION> and SP<ORGANIZATION>, correlation coefficient of r=0.75+/-0.03 ( DP ) and r=0.75+/-0.03 ( SP ), root-mean-squared error ( RMSE<ORGANIZATION> ) of 7.4+/-0.6 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> ( DP ) and 10.3+/-0.8 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> ( SP ), and mean absolute error ( MAE<ORGANIZATION> ) of 6.0+/-0.5 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> ( DP ) and 8.3+/-0.7 mmHg<ORGANIZATION> ( SP ) were obtained across all interventions ( mean+/-SE ). The association was consistent in all the individual interventions ( r≥0.68, RMSE≤5.7 mmHg, and MAE≤4.5 mmHg for DP as well as r≥0.61, RMSE≤7.9 mmHg, and MAE≤6.4 mmHg for SP<ORGANIZATION> on the average ). The minimum number of requisite predictors for robust yet practically realistic BP monitoring appeared to be 3. The association between predictors and BP<ORGANIZATION> was maintained even under regularized calibration ( r=0.63+/-0.05, RMSE=9.3+/-0.8 mmHg<ORGANIZATION>, and MAE=7.6+/-0.7 mmHg for DP as well as r=0.60+/-0.05, RMSE=14.7+/-1.4 mmHg, and MAE=11.9+/-1.1 mmHg for SP<ORGANIZATION> ( mean+/-SE ) ). The requisite predictors for DP<ORGANIZATION> and SP were distinct from each other. The results of this study may provide a viable basis for ultra-convenient BP monitoring based on a limb BCG<ORGANIZATION> alone.
