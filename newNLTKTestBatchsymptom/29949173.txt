 To investigate the protective effects of ISO<ORGANIZATION> on cardiomyocyte injury induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION> ) in H9c2<ORGANIZATION> cells. Cell<PERSON> viability was determined using the 3- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT<ORGANIZATION> ) assay. The activities of LDH<ORGANIZATION> and CK in the supernatant of H9c2<ORGANIZATION> cells with different treatments were determined using colorimetric assays to assess the conversion of pyruvic acid to lactic acid by LDH<ORGANIZATION> and that of triphosphate and creatine to phosphagen by CK<ORGANIZATION>. ISO significantly enhanced cell viability and alleviated the release of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphate kinase in a dose-dependent manner in H9c2<ORGANIZATION> cells treated with LPS<ORGANIZATION>. However, the protective effects of higher doses of ISO<ORGANIZATION> ( 1.4 % and 2.1 % ) had no significant difference. Thus, 1.4 % ISO<ORGANIZATION> was selected for subsequent experiments. ISO<ORGANIZATION> inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory responses, as evidenced by reduced expression of tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin ( IL ) -1Î², and IL-6 ; it also attenuated the activation of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kB p65, and the inhibition of NF-kB p65 DNA-binding activity in H9c2<ORGANIZATION> cells. ISO<ORGANIZATION> also suppressed oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant defense in LPS-treated H9c2<ORGANIZATION> cells, as determined by decreased levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, increased production of glutathione reductase, and enhanced superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Moreover, ISO<ORGANIZATION> inhibited LPS-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis, as shown by reduced caspase-3 activity ; downregulated expression of the pro-apoptotic procaspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax<GPE> ; and upregulated expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. These findings indicate that ISO<ORGANIZATION> reduced LPS-induced H9c2 cell injury via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic activities ; hence, ISO<ORGANIZATION> may be an alternative therapy for septic heart injury.
