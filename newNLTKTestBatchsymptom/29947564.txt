 The purpose of this article is to review the current literature describing primary care providers ' ( PCPs<ORGANIZATION> ) attitudes related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning ( LGBTQ<ORGANIZATION> ) people. LGBTQ individuals experience significant health disparities, and these inequities may be better understood via an ecological systems framework. PCPs<ORGANIZATION> ' actual or perceived discriminatory attitudes can lead to suboptimal treatment or health outcomes for LGBTQ<ORGANIZATION> people. A review of the literature from 2005 through January 2017 was completed using the Cumulative Index<ORGANIZATION> for Nursing and Allied Health Literature<PERSON> and PubMed<ORGANIZATION> ( Medline<ORGANIZATION> ) databases. The purpose, sample, measure ( s ), design, findings, strengths, and weaknesses of each study were examined ; and findings were synthesized, summarized, and critically appraised. Eight articles were eligible for review. There was significant heterogeneity in the studies ' purposes, research questions, LGBTQ<ORGANIZATION> population ( s ) of focus, and findings. Many PCPs<ORGANIZATION> ' attitudes toward LGBTQ<ORGANIZATION> people were positive, but a minority of each studies ' participants had negative attitudes toward LGBTQ<ORGANIZATION> people. Stigma<PERSON> and health care barriers negatively affect LGBTQ<ORGANIZATION> health. Interventions must address LGBTQ<ORGANIZATION> health disparities at the individual, mesosytem, exosystem, and macrosystem levels. Research, education, and practice strategies all must be integrated across socioecological levels as components of a population-based approach to eliminate health disparities for LGBTQ<ORGANIZATION> persons.
