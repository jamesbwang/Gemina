 Background<PERSON> Sacubitril/valsartan has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations due to heart failure in adult patients with reduced ejection fraction when compared to enalapril. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of sacubitril ( neprilysin inhibitor ) and valsartan ( angiotensin receptor blocker ) has not been evaluated in patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy, as these patients were excluded from the recent pivotal trial, PARADIGM-HF. However, current guidelines for the evaluation and management of cardiovascular complications of cancer therapy, published by the Canadian<GPE> Cardiovascular Society, direct clinicians to the Canadian<GPE> Cardiovascular Society Heart Failure Guidelines for the management of cancer patients who develop clinical heart failure or an asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction ( e.g. > 10 % reduction from baseline or left ventricular ejection fraction < 53 % ), which could include the use of sacubitril/valsartan. Methods<ORGANIZATION> Retrospective descriptive comparative case study of two patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan. Results We present data from two patients who experienced anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy and were successfully managed with sacubitril/valsartan after suboptimal responses to traditional evidence-based heart failure therapies. Both patients demonstrated some recovery of function and normalization of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Sacubitril/valsartan was well tolerated with minimal side effects. To date, neither patient has required hospitalization or additional clinic interventions for heart failure. Conclusions While further large scale studies are required to determine a comprehensive safety and efficacy profile, we report two cases of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy survivors managed with sacubitril/valsartan with minimal side effects and no hospitalizations.
