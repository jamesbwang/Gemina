 The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC<ORGANIZATION> ) and its precursor lesion Barrett<PERSON> 's esophagus ( BE ) has been increasing steadily in the western world in recent decades. Understanding the cellular origins of BE<ORGANIZATION> and the conditions responsible for their malignant transformation would greatly facilitate risk assessment and identification of patients at risk of progression, but this topic remains a source of debate. Here, we review recent findings that have provided support for the gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ<ORGANIZATION> ) as the main source of stem cells that give rise to BE<ORGANIZATION> and EAC<ORGANIZATION>. These include both gastric cardia cells and transitional basal cells. Furthermore, we discuss the role of chronic injury and inflammation in a tumor microenvironment as a major factor in promoting stem cell expansion and proliferation as well as transformation of the GEJ-derived stem cells and progression to EAC<ORGANIZATION>. We conclude that there exists a large amount of empirical support for the GEJ<ORGANIZATION> as the likely source of BE<ORGANIZATION> stem cells. While BE<ORGANIZATION> seems to resemble a successful adaptation to esophageal damage, carcinogenesis appears as a consequence of natural selection at the level of GEJ<ORGANIZATION> stem cells, and later glands, that expand into the esophagus wherein the local ecology creates the selective landscape for cancer progression.
