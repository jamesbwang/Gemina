 The human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) family consists of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases: epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR<ORGANIZATION> ), HER2<ORGANIZATION>, HER3<ORGANIZATION>, and HER4<ORGANIZATION>. They are part of a complex signalling network and stimulate intracellular pathways regulating cell growth and differentiation. So far, monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs<ORGANIZATION> ) and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR<ORGANIZATION> and HER2<ORGANIZATION> have been developed and approved. Recently, focus has turned to HER3<ORGANIZATION> as it may play an important role in resistance to EGFR- and HER2-targeting therapies. HER3-targeting agents have been undergoing clinical evaluation for the last 10 years and currently thirteen mAbs are in phase 1 or 2 clinical studies. Single<PERSON> agent activity has proven to be limited, however, the tolerability was favourable. Thus, combinations of HER3-binding mAbs with other HER-targeting therapies or chemotherapies have been pursued in various solid tumor entities. Data<PERSON> indicate that the HER3-binding ligand heregulin may serve as a response prediction marker for HER3-targeting therapy. Within this review the current status of clinical development of HER3-targeting compounds is described.
