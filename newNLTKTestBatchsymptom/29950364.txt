 Arachnoid<GPE> granulations are common incidentally detected small dural lesions which are usually asymptomatic and follow cerebrospinal fluid density/signal intensity on CT/MRI. Such lesions reaching a size of more than 1 cm are termed as giant arachnoid granulations ( GAGs<ORGANIZATION> ) which have been previously reported to cause venous hypertension and headaches. We report a case of GAG<ORGANIZATION> involving the proximal half of the superior sagittal sinus in a 45-year-old male patient which was associated with left temporal thrombosed dural arteriovenous fistula ( AVF<ORGANIZATION> ) whose thrombosed draining veins were seen converging towards the site of GAG<ORGANIZATION>. The patient presented with three episodes of generalised tonic-clonic seizures and improved with conservative treatment. No reports of such association of GAG<ORGANIZATION> with AVF<ORGANIZATION> is available in the literature, and we believe it could have occurred due to venous hypertension induced by GAG<ORGANIZATION>.
