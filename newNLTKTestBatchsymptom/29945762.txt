 Traditional electromyography-assisted optimization ( TEMG<ORGANIZATION> ) models are commonly employed to compute trunk muscle forces and spinal loads for the design of clinical/treatment and ergonomics/prevention programs. These models calculate muscle forces solely based on moment equilibrium requirements at spinal joints. Due<PERSON> to simplifications/assumptions in the measurement/processing of surface EMG<ORGANIZATION> activities and in the presumed muscle EMG-force relationship, these models fail to satisfy stability requirements. Hence<PERSON>, the present study aimed to develop a novel stability-based EMG-assisted optimization ( SEMG<ORGANIZATION> ) method applied to a musculoskeletal spine model in which trunk muscle forces were estimated by enforcing equilibrium conditions constrained to stability requirements. That is, second-order partial derivatives of the potential energy of the musculoskeletal model with respect to its generalized coordinates were enforced to be positive semi-definite. Fifteen<PERSON> static tasks in upright and flexed postures with and without a hand load at different heights were simulated. The SEMG<ORGANIZATION> model predicted different muscle recruitments/forces ( generally larger global and local muscle forces ) and spinal loads ( slightly larger ) compared to the TEMG<ORGANIZATION> model. Such task-specific differences were dependant on the assumed magnitude of the muscle stiffness coefficient in the SEMG<ORGANIZATION> model. The SEMG<ORGANIZATION> model-predicted and measured L4-L5 intradiscal pressures were in satisfactory agreement during simulated activities.
