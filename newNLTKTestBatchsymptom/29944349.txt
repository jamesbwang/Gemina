 Group 10 metal catalysts have shown much promise for the copolymerization of non-polar with polar alkenes to directly generate functional materials, but access to high copolymer molecular weights nevertheless remains a key challenge toward practical applications in this field. In the context of identifying new strategies for molecular weight control, we report a series of highly polarized P ( V ) -P ( III<ORGANIZATION> ) chelating ligands that manifest unique space filling and electrostatic effects within the coordination sphere of single component Pd polymerization catalysts and exert important influences on ( co ) polymer molecular weights. Single<PERSON> component, cationic phosphonic diamide-phosphine ( PDAP<ORGANIZATION> ) Pd catalysts are competent to generate linear, functional polyethylenes with Mw<PERSON> up to ca. 2 × 105 g mol-1, significantly higher than prototypical catalysts in this field, and with polar content up to ca. 9 mol %. Functional groups are positioned by these catalysts almost exclusively along the main chain, not at chain ends or ends of branches, which mimics the microstructures of commercial linear low-density polyethylenes. Spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and computational data indicate PDAP<ORGANIZATION> coordination to Pd<GPE> manifests cationic yet electron-rich active species, which may correlate to their complimentary catalytic properties versus privileged catalysts such as electrophilic -diimine ( Broohart-type ) or neutral phosphine-sulfonato ( Drent<ORGANIZATION> type ) complexes. While steric blocking within the catalyst coordination sphere has long been a reliable strategy for catalyst molecular weight control, data from this study suggest electronic control should be considered as a complimentary concept less prone to suppression of comonomer enchainment that can occur with highly sterically congested catalysts.
