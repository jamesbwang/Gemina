 Research<GPE> on adverse events ( AEs<ORGANIZATION> ) in outpatient surgery has been limited. As part of a Veterans Health Administration ( VA ) project on AE surveillance, we chart-reviewed selected outpatient surgical cases to characterize the nature and severity of AEs<ORGANIZATION>. We abstracted financial year 2012-2015 VA outpatient surgery cases selected with high ( n = 1185 ) and low ( n = 1072 ) likelihood of an AE based on postoperative health care utilization. The abstraction tool included established AE definitions and validated harm and severity scales. We found AEs<ORGANIZATION> in 608 high-likelihood ( 51 % ) and 126 low-likelihood outpatient surgical procedures ( 12 % ). Among 1010 unique AEs<ORGANIZATION>, the most common were wound issues ( n = 261, 26 % ), urinary retention ( 23 % ), and urinary tract infections ( 12 % ). While 63 % of all AEs involved minimal harm, 28 % required hospitalization, and 9 % were severely harmful including 8 AEs requiring intervention to sustain life and 2 deaths. Overall, 102 AEs ( 10 % ) required, at minimum, a repeat surgery to treat. Among VA outpatient surgical procedures selected based on likelihood of an AE, nearly 40 % of identified events carried more than minimal patient harm, undermining the claim that outpatient surgery is relatively safe. Prevalent and preventable AEs<ORGANIZATION> such as wound dehiscence and urinary retention may be useful targets for quality improvement.
