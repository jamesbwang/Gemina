 Complications related to peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD<ORGANIZATION> ) including intraperitoneal rupture of renal cyst, hernia, membrane failure, and peritonitis have been reported. However, long-term clinical outcomes of ADPKD<ORGANIZATION> patients on PD remain unclear. We performed this meta-analysis to assess the risks of death, technique failure, and peritonitis in ADPKD<GPE> patients on PD. A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE<ORGANIZATION>, EMBASE<ORGANIZATION>, Cochrane<PERSON> databases from inception through October 2017 to identify studies that evaluated outcomes of ADPKD<ORGANIZATION> patients on PD including the risks of death, technique failure, and peritonitis. Non-ADPKD patients on PD were used as controls. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian<GPE> and Laird<PERSON>. Twelve<PERSON> cohort studies with a total of 14,673 patients on PD ( 931 ADPKD<ORGANIZATION> and 13,742 non-ADPKD patients ) were enrolled. Compared with non-ADPKD status, ADPKD<ORGANIZATION> was associated with significantly decreased mortality risk with pooled OR of 0.68 ( 95 % CI, 0.53-0.86, I Compared with non-ADPKD patients on PD, our study demonstrates that ADPKD<ORGANIZATION> patients on PD have 0.68-fold decreased mortality risk. There are no associations of ADPKD<ORGANIZATION> status with the risks of technique failure or peritonitis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
