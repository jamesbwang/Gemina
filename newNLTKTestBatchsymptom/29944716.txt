 Improving soft tissue attachment and reducing bacterial colonization on titanium abutments are key factors for the long-term maintenance of healthy soft and hard peri-implant tissues. This in vitro study was conducted to compare the biocompatibility and antibacterial activity of four different surfaces: uncoated Ti6Al4V, anodized, and coated with titanium nitride or zirconium nitride. Surface topography was investigated with a high-resolution system for measuring surface finishes. Human<PERSON> gingival fibroblast ( HGF<ORGANIZATION> ) adhesion and proliferation were examined using MTT<ORGANIZATION> assay, Scanning Electron Microscopy<PERSON> ( SEM<ORGANIZATION> ) imaging, immunofluorescence analysis and real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION> for selected target genes. The hemolysis and AMES<ORGANIZATION> tests were performed to assess the chemical compounds ' blood compatibility and mutagenic potential, respectively. Antibacterial activity was tested against five bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavity ( Streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguinis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. oralis ), and the percentage of dead bacteria was calculated. Roughness measurements confirmed a substantial similarity between the surfaces and their compatibility with clinical applications. MTT<ORGANIZATION> assay, SEM<ORGANIZATION> analysis and immunofluorescence staining showed adhesion and proliferation of HGFs<ORGANIZATION> cultured on all the examined surfaces. PCR<ORGANIZATION> confirmed that HGFs<ORGANIZATION> produced extracellular matrix components efficiently on all the surfaces. No hemolytic activity was detected, and the AMES<ORGANIZATION> test confirmed the surfaces ' clinical safety. For all tested bacterial strains, biofilms grown on the zirconium nitride surface showed a higher percentage of dead bacteria than on the other disks. The titanium nitride surface inactivated bacterial biofilms, too, but to a lesser extent.
