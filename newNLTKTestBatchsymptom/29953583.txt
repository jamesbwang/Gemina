 Lipoprotein<GPE> lipase ( LPL<ORGANIZATION> ) mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL<ORGANIZATION> ) is associated with an unmutated immunoglobulin profile and poor clinical outcome. We evaluated the subcellular localization of LPL<ORGANIZATION> protein in CLL<ORGANIZATION> cells that did or did not express LPL<ORGANIZATION> mRNA. Our results show that LPL<ORGANIZATION> protein is differently located in CLL<ORGANIZATION> cells depending on whether it is incorporated from the extracellular medium in mutated CLL<ORGANIZATION> or generated de novo by leukaemic cells of unmutated patients. The specific quantification of endogenous LPL<ORGANIZATION> protein correlates with mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression levels and mutational IGHV<ORGANIZATION> status, suggesting LPL<ORGANIZATION> protein as a possible reliable prognostic marker in CLL<ORGANIZATION>.
