 Catecholaminergic<GPE> polymorphic ventricular tachycardia ( CPVT<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the leading causes of sudden arrhythmic death in the young. The QT<ORGANIZATION> interval in CPVT<ORGANIZATION> patients is typically within the normal range. However, those with prolonged QT interval have often been diagnosed with mutation-negative long QT syndrome ( LQTS<ORGANIZATION> ). We report three CPVT<ORGANIZATION> patients with prolonged QT interval. Case 1 and 2 were diagnosed as LQTS<ORGANIZATION> at first. Genetic test using next-generation sequencing ( NGS<ORGANIZATION> ) revealed
