 Left<GPE> lateral mitral isthmus ( LLMI<ORGANIZATION> ) linear ablation is a safe and effective technique for treating left mitral flutter. LLMI<ORGANIZATION> linear ablation with pulmonary vein isolation may reduce the recurrence of persistent atrial fibrillation. However, epicardial ablation within the coronary sinus ( CS ) is often required to create the LLMI<ORGANIZATION> block line. If the necessity for epicardial ablation is checked before ablation, complications may be reduced. We recruited 135 patients who underwent their first LLMI<ORGANIZATION> ablation and divided them into two groups, one group not requiring epicardial ablation for creating a conduction block at the LLMI<ORGANIZATION> ( Endo<ORGANIZATION> group ) and another requiring it ( Epi<ORGANIZATION> group ). These two groups were compared in terms of the electrogram characteristics of the CS<ORGANIZATION>. Bidirectional block through the LLMI<ORGANIZATION> was achieved in 94.8 % of patients. In 42 % of these patients, not only the endocardium but also the epicardium was ablated. As for the electrogram, the Endo<ORGANIZATION> group had lower atrium voltage and atrioventricular voltage ratios ( p = 0.009 ) than the Epi<ORGANIZATION> group before LLMI<ORGANIZATION> ablation. By contrast, there were no significant differences in the atrium voltage and the atrioventricular voltage ratio between these two groups after LLMI<ORGANIZATION> ablation. For creating a conduction block at the LLMI<ORGANIZATION>, the atrium voltage and the atrioventricular voltage ratio in the CS<ORGANIZATION> before ablation are important. The atrioventricular voltage ratio is a crucial criterion for determining whether epicardial ablation is necessary ; furthermore, the atrioventricular voltage ratio in the CS<ORGANIZATION> must be reduced with or without epicardial ablation.
