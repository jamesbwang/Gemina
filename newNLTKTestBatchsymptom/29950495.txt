 An 80-year-old man presented repeatedly to his general practitioner with 3 months of unexplained persistent frontal headaches. CT head revealed no diagnosis. His dentist diagnosed his co-existing jaw pain as bruxism. Three months later, the patient happened to attend a routine ophthalmology follow-up appointment. During this routine appointment, features of giant cell arteritis ( GCA<ORGANIZATION> ) including worrying visual complications were first noted. His inflammatory markers ( C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ) were not significantly raised-contrary to the norm. A temporal artery ultrasound and biopsy were performed, in light of the history. This confirmed GCA<ORGANIZATION>. He was commenced on high-dose oral prednisolone and was managed by ophthalmology and rheumatology. At 4 weeks, symptoms resolved with no permanent visual loss despite a prolonged initial symptomatic period. Multiple symptomatic presentations to different specialties should therefore alert clinicians to a unifying diagnosis, for example, vasculitis. Serious illnesses may present with severe symptoms despite normal screening investigations.
