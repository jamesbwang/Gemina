 A substantial portion of We performed a retrospective review of all inpatients with CDI<ORGANIZATION>, in a 1300-bed tertiary-care hospital in Korea<GPE>, from 2008 through 2015. CO-CDI was defined as CDI<ORGANIZATION> occurring within 48 h of admission. Poor<PERSON> outcome was defined as follows: 1 ) all-cause 30-day mortality, 2 ) in-hospital mortality, or 3 ) surgery due to CDI<ORGANIZATION>. Of a total 1256 CDIs occurring over 8 years, 152 ( 12.1 % ) cases were classified as CO-CDI and 23 ( 15.1 % ) had a poor outcome, including 22 ( 14.5 % ) cases of mortality and 2 ( 1.3 % ) cases of surgery. Patients with a poor outcome had a higher mean age than those without a poor outcome ( 75.8 vs. 69.6 years, Clinicians<PERSON> should not only be aware of the possibility of CDI<ORGANIZATION> in the community setting but also pay more attention to PPI-using elderly patients with anemia in consideration of a poor outcome.
