 The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Pycnogenol® supplementation in terms of safety and tolerability in the setting of preclinical or borderline, initial symptoms of benign prostatic hyperthrophy ( BPH<ORGANIZATION> ), in otherwise healthy subjects, using Pycnogenol® over a period of 60 days. Seventy-five healthy men with symptoms and signs of initial BPH were included. The subjects were divided into three groups: 1 ) control group using only the standard management ( SM ) ; 2 ) a group using SM plus Pycnogenol® 150 mg/day ; 3 ) a group using standard pharmacological management. BPH<ORGANIZATION> symptoms like emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak flow, straining, nocturia, were all significantly improved with Pycnogenol® ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) and the difference with both control groups was statistically significant ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Pycnogenol® may be an important option for self-management of BPH<ORGANIZATION> in otherwise healthy men.
