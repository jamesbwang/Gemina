 Atrial<GPE> fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AF surgery is widely used for rhythm control of AF<ORGANIZATION>, but previous studies have shown varying results. This study sought to investigate the long-term efficacy of concomitant maze IV ( CMIV<ORGANIZATION> ) surgery in an unselected AF population and identify predictors of late AF recurrence. In total 144 consecutive patients, who underwent CMIV<ORGANIZATION> between January 2006 and December 2010 were enrolled. By data from electronic medical records, registers, and rhythm prints, late AF recurrences and heart rhythm at latest follow-up were retrospectively registered. All patients still alive were invited to an ambulant follow-up to update rhythm status. During a median ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> ) follow-up of 7.39 ( 2.67 ) years, 114 ( 79.2 % ) patients had recurrence. The cumulative incidence of sinus rhythm ( SR ) without antiarrhythmic drugs ( AADs<ORGANIZATION> ) was 52.3 % after 1 year. Long-term results after 2, 5 and 7 years were 47.9 %, 32.6 % and 25.1 %, respectively. At latest follow-up 34.7 % were in SR off AADs<ORGANIZATION>. No difference in 10-year event-free survival stratified by recurrence were found ( CMIV<ORGANIZATION> in the present cohort provided limited long-term success in obtaining SR. SAF, longer AF duration, and postoperative ATA<ORGANIZATION> were associated with late AF recurrence.
