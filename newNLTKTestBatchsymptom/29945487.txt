 Predictors of early or delayed recovery are unclear in peripartum cardiomyopathy ( PPCM<ORGANIZATION> ). Therefore, we aimed to assess the prognostic value of serial assessment of clinical, echocardiographic and biochemical markers in patients with PPCM<ORGANIZATION>. Fifty-two consecutive women with PPCM<ORGANIZATION> were enrolled in this prospective study. Each patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography, B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP<ORGANIZATION> ) and C-reactive protein ( CRP<ORGANIZATION> ) measurement at admission, and every 3 months. Early recovery was defined as resolution of heart failure at 6 months postdiagnosis, delayed recovery was defined if the length of time required for recovery of left ventricular function was longer than 6 months, and persistent left ventricular dysfunction ( PLVD<ORGANIZATION> ) was defined as an ejection fraction of less than 50 % at the end of follow-up. Thirty patients ( 57.7 % ) recovered completely, 10 died ( 19.2 % ), and 12 ( 23.1 % ) had PLVD<ORGANIZATION>. There were no significant differences in baseline BNP<ORGANIZATION> and CRP<ORGANIZATION> values between patients who recovered completely and who did not recover. However, patients with complete recovery were more likely to have a higher left ventricular ejection fraction, smaller left ventricle end-systolic dimensions at baseline, and lower CRP<ORGANIZATION> and BNP<ORGANIZATION> levels at follow-up. Elevated levels of BNP<ORGANIZATION> and CRP<ORGANIZATION> on follow up at 3 and 6 months were associated with nonrecovery. Third<PERSON> and sixth month BNP<ORGANIZATION> values were significantly lower in patients with rapid recovery, compared to patients with delayed recovery. Bromocriptine<PERSON> therapy was also associated with early recovery. Persistent elevation of plasma CRP<ORGANIZATION> and BNP<ORGANIZATION> levels at follow-up portend a slower response or nonrecovery in patients with PPCM<ORGANIZATION>. Bromocriptine<PERSON> therapy was an independent predictor of early recovery.
