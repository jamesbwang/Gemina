 We aimed to identify the adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs<ORGANIZATION> ) and antithrombotics on the upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) mucosa in a clinical setting as a case-control study using a large-scale medical database in Japan<GPE>. We evaluated the risk of upper GI mucosal injuries in patients receiving NSAIDs<ORGANIZATION> and antithrombotics using the Japan<GPE> Medical Data Center claims database with data for 13 million accumulated patients, from January 2009 to December 2014. Endoscopically evaluated upper GI mucosal injuries were peptic ulcers ( n = 143,271 ), upper GI bleeding ( n = 10,545 ), and gastroesophageal reflux disease ( n = 154,755 ). For each patient, ten controls were matched by age, sex, and diagnosis month. The odds ratio ( OR ) for peptic ulcers was 1.45, 1.31, 1.50, 1.53, and 1.62 ; for upper GI bleeding: 1.76, 1.62, 1.96, 1.82, and 2.38 ; and for gastroesophageal reflux disease: 1.54, 1.41, 1.89, 1.67, and 1.91 for NSAIDs<ORGANIZATION>, COX-2 selective inhibitors, low-dose aspirin, antiplatelet drugs, and anticoagulants, respectively ( all statistically significant: P < 0.001 ). Polypharmacy with NSAIDs<ORGANIZATION> and antithrombotic drugs increased the risk of upper GI injuries compared with single-drug therapy. The injury risk was also increased by lifestyle-related diseases, including diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. This case-control study using the large organized Japanese<GPE> claims database provided the risk of upper GI mucosal injuries in patients receiving NSAIDs<ORGANIZATION> and antithrombotic drugs.
