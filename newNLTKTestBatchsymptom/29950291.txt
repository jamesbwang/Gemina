 Bone<GPE> marrow megakaryocytes ( MKs<ORGANIZATION> ) produce platelets by extending proplatelets into sinusoidal blood vessels. Defects in thrombopoiesis can lead to thrombocytopenia associated with increased bleeding tendency. Recently, the platelet disorder congenital autosomal recessive small-platelet thrombocytopenia ( CARST<ORGANIZATION> ) was described which is caused by mutations in the ADAP<ORGANIZATION> ( Adhesion<ORGANIZATION> and degranulation promoting adaptor protein ; synonym: FYB, SLAP130/120 ) gene, and characterized by microthrombocytopenia and bleeding symptoms. In this study we used constitutive ADAP-deficient mice ( Adap<ORGANIZATION>
