 Deep<GPE> brain stimulation ( DBS<ORGANIZATION> ) is known as the most effective technique in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson<PERSON> disease ( PD ) and epilepsy. Relative healing and effective control of disease symptoms are the most significant reasons for the tangible tendency in use and development of this technology. Nevertheless, more cellular and molecular investigations are required to reveal the detailed mechanism of DBS<ORGANIZATION>. Here, we reviewed the methods, challenges and the ways to overcome the limitations of DBS<ORGANIZATION>. Also, challenges in probe fabrication technology, material selection, related mechanical stability and biocompatibility concerns are discussed. Finally, closed- and open-loop stimulation systems were compared.
