 Magnoliae<PERSON> Flos<ORGANIZATION> ( MF ) is a traditional medicinal herb used for managing rhinitis, sinusitis and headache. The purpose of the present study was to determine the neuroprotective effect of MF<ORGANIZATION> against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and to assess the underlying mechanism. Glutamate<ORGANIZATION> is a major endogenous excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases by excessive activation. MF extract was subjected to a neuroprotective effect assay in HT22<GPE> mouse hippocampal cells. The mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of MF<ORGANIZATION> extract was evaluated by assaying reactive oxygen species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ) levels, intracellular Ca
