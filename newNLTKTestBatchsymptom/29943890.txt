 To describe differences in patient characteristics and outcomes by ethnicity in patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM ) and heart failure ( HF ) with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF<ORGANIZATION>, ejection fraction â‰¤35 % ) in a multi-ethnic cohort. Patient<PERSON> level data from two cohorts ( HF-ACTION and ASIAN-HF ) were combined, and patients grouped by self-reported ethnicity. DM was defined as the presence of a clinical diagnosis and/or receiving anti-diabetic therapy. A total of 6214 ( 1324 whites, 674 blacks, 1297 Chinese<GPE>, 1510 Indians, 717 Malays, 692 Japanese/Koreans ) patients were included. The overall prevalence of DM<ORGANIZATION> was 39.5 % ( n = 2454 ). The prevalence of DM<ORGANIZATION> was lowest in whites ( 29.3 % ), followed by Japanese/Koreans ( 34.1 % ), blacks ( 35.9 % ), Chinese<GPE> ( 42.3 % ), Indians<GPE> ( 44.2 % ), and highest in Malays<GPE> ( 51.9 % ). The correlation between age, sex, body mass index, coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease and chronic kidney disease with DM<ORGANIZATION> differed significantly by ethnicity ( P for interaction < 0.05 ). The strongest correlations were seen in Malay<GPE> women, whites with obesity, Indians<GPE> with coronary artery disease and hypertension, and blacks with chronic kidney disease. On multivariable analyses, DM<ORGANIZATION> was significantly associated with the composite of 1-year overall mortality/HF hospitalization ( hazard ratio 1.37, 95 % confidence interval 1.19-1.57 ; P<PERSON> < 0.001 ), with no interaction by ethnicity ( P for interaction =0.31 ). There is marked heterogeneity in the prevalence and correlates of DM<ORGANIZATION> among different ethnic groups with HF<ORGANIZATION> worldwide. Subgroups<PERSON> particularly predisposed to DM warrant special attention, since DM<ORGANIZATION> increases the combined risk of morbidity and mortality in all ethnicities with HF<ORGANIZATION>.
