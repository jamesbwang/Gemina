 Zinc-oxide ( ZnO<ORGANIZATION> ) is widely used as an n-type electron transporting layer ( ETL<ORGANIZATION> ) for quantum dot ( QD ) light-emitting diode ( QLED ) because various metal doping can be possible and ZnO<ORGANIZATION> nanoparticle can be processed at low temperatures. We report here a Li- and Mg-doped ZnO<ORGANIZATION>, MLZO<ORGANIZATION>, which is used for ETL<ORGANIZATION> of highly efficient and long lifetime QLEDs<ORGANIZATION>. Co-doping, Mg<PERSON> and Li<PERSON>, in ZnO<ORGANIZATION> increases its band gap and electrical resistivity and thus can enhance charge balance in emission layer ( EML<ORGANIZATION> ). It is found also that the O-H concentration at the oxide surface decreases and exciton decay time of QDs<ORGANIZATION> on the metal oxide increases by co-doping in ZnO<ORGANIZATION>. The inverted green QLEDs with MLZO<ORGANIZATION> ETL exhibits the maximum current efficiency ( CE<ORGANIZATION>
