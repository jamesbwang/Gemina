 Managing depression in primary care settings has increased with the rise of integrated models of care, such as patient-centered medical homes ( PCMHs<ORGANIZATION> ). The relationship between patient experience in PCMH<ORGANIZATION> settings and receipt of depression treatment is unknown. In a large sample of Veterans diagnosed with depression, we examined whether positive PCMH<ORGANIZATION> experiences predicted subsequent initiation or continuation of treatment for depression. We conducted a lagged cross-sectional study of depression treatment among Veterans with depression diagnoses ( n = 27,362 ) in the years before ( Y1 ) and after ( Y2 ) they completed the Veterans Health Administration<ORGANIZATION> 's national 2013 PCMH<ORGANIZATION> Survey of Healthcare Experiences<ORGANIZATION> of Patients<ORGANIZATION>. We assessed patient experiences in four domains, each categorized as positive/moderate/negative. Depression treatment, determined from administrative records, was defined annually as 90 days of antidepressant medications or six psychotherapy visits. Multivariable logistic regressions measured associations between PCMH<ORGANIZATION> experiences and receipt of depression treatment in Y2<GPE>, accounting for treatment in Y1<GPE>. Among those who did not receive depression treatment in Y1<GPE> ( n = 4613 ), positive experiences in three domains ( comprehensiveness, shared decision-making, self-management support ) predicted greater initiation of treatment in Y2<GPE>. Among those who received depression treatment in Y1<GPE> ( n = 22,749 ), positive or moderate experiences in four domains ( comprehensiveness, care coordination, medication decision-making, self-management support ) predicted greater continuation of treatment in Y2<GPE>. In a national PCMH<ORGANIZATION> setting, patient experiences with integrated care, including care coordination, comprehensiveness, involvement in shared decision-making, and self-management support predicted patients ' subsequent initiation and continuation of depression treatment over time-a relationship that could affect physical and mental health outcomes.
