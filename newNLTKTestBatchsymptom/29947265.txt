 To determine whether breast MRI-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy ( MRI-VAB ) high-risk lesion histology influences surgical or long-term imaging follow-up outcomes. Patients with imaging-concordant high-risk findings on 9-gauge breast MRI-VAB between January 2007 and July 2012 who had surgical histopathology or 2 year imaging follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. 90 patients with 99 lesions were included. Lesions were atypical ductal hyperplasia ( ADH<ORGANIZATION> ) ( n = 21 ), lobular neoplasia [ n = 36 ; atypical lobular hyperplasia ( ALH<ORGANIZATION> ) ( n = 22 ), lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS<ORGANIZATION> ) ( n = 6 ), and ALH<ORGANIZATION> plus LCIS<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 8 ) ], and other high-risk lesion ( n = 42 ; papillary lesions, radial scar, flat epithelial atypia, atypia unspecified ). Of 53 excised lesions, 6 ( 11 % ) were upgraded to invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS<ORGANIZATION> ). 4 of 21 ( 19 % ) ADH<ORGANIZATION> lesions were upgraded to DCIS<ORGANIZATION>. 2 of 36 ( 6 % ) lobular neoplasia lesions, both combined ALH<ORGANIZATION> and LCIS<ORGANIZATION>, were upgraded to DCIS<ORGANIZATION>, and invasive lobular carcinoma, respectively. The remaining 46 lesions were managed conservatively with imaging follow-up: 17 ( 37 % ) had mammography only, while 29 ( 63 % ) had mammography and MRI<ORGANIZATION> follow-up. There was no evidence of breast cancer development at the site of MRI-VAB in the cases with only imaging follow-up. We conclude that the upgrade rate for high-risk lesions at MRI-VAB at surgical excision is low. Surgical excision is warranted for ADH<ORGANIZATION> and combined ALH-LCIS lesions. For other lesions, a multidisciplinary approach to decide on personalized management may be appropriate. Advances in knowledge: Surgical excision is warranted for ADH<ORGANIZATION> lesions and combined ALH-LCIS lesions identified at breast MRI-VAB. A multidisciplinary approach to patient management of other high-risk lesions may be appropriate.
