 The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV<ORGANIZATION> ) is a DNA<ORGANIZATION> lymphotropic herpesvirus and the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis. EBV<ORGANIZATION> is highly prevalent since it affects more than 90 % of individuals worldwide and has been linked to several malignancies including PTLDs<ORGANIZATION>, which are one of the most common malignancies following transplantation. Among all the EBV<ORGANIZATION> genes, most of the recent investigations focused on studying the LMP-1 oncogene because of its high degree of polymorphism and association with tumorigenic activity. There are two main EBV<ORGANIZATION> genotypes, Type 1 and 2, distinguished by the differences in the EBNA-2 gene. Further<PERSON> sub genotyping can be characterized by analyzing the LMP-1 gene variation. The virus primarily transmits through oral secretions and persists as a latent infection in human B-cells. However, it can be transmitted through organ transplantations and blood transfusions. In addition, symptoms of EBV<ORGANIZATION> infection are not distinguishable from other viral infections, and therefore, it remains questionable whether there is a need to screen for EBV<ORGANIZATION> prior to blood transfusion. Although the process of leukoreduction decreases the viral copies present in the leukocytes, it does not eliminate the risk of EBV<ORGANIZATION> transmission through blood products. Here, we provide a review of the EBV<ORGANIZATION> epidemiology and the genetic variability of the oncogene LMP-1. Then, we underscore the findings of recent EBV<ORGANIZATION> seroprevalence and viremia studies among blood donors as a highly prevalent transfusion transmissible oncovirus.
