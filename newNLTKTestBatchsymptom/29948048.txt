 Imaging<GPE> plays a key role throughout the renal cell carcinoma ( RCC<ORGANIZATION> ) patient pathway, from diagnosis and staging of the disease, to the assessment of response to therapy. This review aims to summarise current knowledge with regard to imaging in the RCC<ORGANIZATION> patient pathway, highlighting recent advances and challenges. A literature review was performed using Medline<PERSON>. Particular<ORGANIZATION> focus was paid to RCC<ORGANIZATION> imaging in the diagnosis, staging and response assessment following therapy. Characterisation of small renal masses ( SRM<ORGANIZATION> ) remains a diagnostic conundrum. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS<ORGANIZATION> ) has been increasingly applied in this field, as have emerging technologies such as multiparametric MRI<ORGANIZATION>, radiomics and molecular imaging with The diagnosis and characterisation of SRM<ORGANIZATION> and response assessment following targeted therapy for advanced RCC are key challenges which warrant further research.
