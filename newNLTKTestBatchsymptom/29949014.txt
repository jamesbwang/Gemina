 Clinical<GPE> trials conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM<ORGANIZATION> ) treated with glucose-lowering drugs and examining cardiovascular-related outcomes have yielded mixed results. In this work, we aimed to assess the relative treatment effects of empagliflozin versus sitagliptin and saxagliptin ( dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitors ) on cardiovascular-related outcomes in patients with T2DM<ORGANIZATION>. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify clinical trials assessing cardiovascular-related outcomes for sitagliptin-, saxagliptin-, and empagliflozin-treated patients with T2DM<ORGANIZATION>. A network meta-analysis of indirect treatment comparisons was conducted in a Bayesian<GPE> framework. Hazard<PERSON> ratios ( HR ) and 95 % credible intervals ( CrI<ORGANIZATION> ) were computed for six cardiovascular-related outcomes to estimate the relative efficacies of these agents. Empagliflozin<PERSON> showed a statistically significant superiority over saxagliptin ( HR 0.60 ; 95 % CrI 0.46-0.80 ) and sitagliptin ( HR 0.60 ; 95 % CrI 0.46-0.79 ) to reduce the risk for cardiovascular-related mortality. For all-cause mortality, empagliflozin showed a statistically significant risk reduction compared to saxagliptin ( HR 0.61 ; 95 % CrI 0.49-0.76 ) and sitagliptin ( HR 0.67 ; 95 % CrI 0.54-0.83 ). A similar pattern was observed in the risk reduction for hospitalization due to heart failure, where empagliflozin was found to be statistically significantly superior to saxagliptin ( HR 0.51 ; 95 % CrI 0.37-0.70 ) and sitagliptin ( HR 0.65 ; 95 % CrI 0.47-0.90 ). Empagliflozin<PERSON> was not statistically significantly different to sitagliptin and saxagliptin with regard to the risk of a composite endpoint composed of death, stroke or myocardial infarction. In this indirect comparison to the DPP-4 inhibitors saxagliptin and sitagliptin, empagliflozin significantly lowered the risk of cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause mortality and hospitalizations due to heart failure.
