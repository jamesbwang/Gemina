 Autoinflammatory<GPE> diseases ( AIDs<ORGANIZATION> ) are a recently described group of conditions caused by mutations in multiple genes that code for proteins of the innate immune system. Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes ( CAPS<ORGANIZATION> ) are autoinflammatory diseases comprising three clinically overlapping disorders: familial cold urticarial syndrome ( FCAS<ORGANIZATION> ), Muckle-Wells syndrome ( MWS<ORGANIZATION> ), and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease ( NOMID<ORGANIZATION> ). CAPS have been associated with gain-of-function variations in NLRP3<GPE> ( NOD-like receptor family, pyrin containing domain-3 ). However, a new class of autoinflammatory disease resembling FCAS<ORGANIZATION> or MWS<ORGANIZATION> has been described in patients with NLRP12<ORGANIZATION> mutations. Here, we report a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with AID who developed an unexpected C3 glomerulopathy during attacks and carried a novel variation in NLRP12<GPE>. Following treatment with IL<ORGANIZATION> ( interleukin ) 1 targeting agents, all symptoms and inflammation resolved. This is the first case in the literature affected by both autoinflammatory disease and C3 glomerulopathy.
