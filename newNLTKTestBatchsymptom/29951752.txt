 Receptor<GPE> tyrosine kinases ( RTKs<ORGANIZATION> ) play critical roles in gastric cancer ( GC ) progression and are potential targets for novel molecular-targeted agents or photo-immunotherapies. During patient selection, targeted biopsy is the first step. However, heterogeneous expression of RTKs<ORGANIZATION> based on the macroscopic appearance in GC<GPE> has not been extensively addressed. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated differences in RTK<ORGANIZATION> expression associated with macroscopic appearance in GC. In total, 375 consecutive patients who had undergone gastrectomy at the National Cancer Center Hospital East<ORGANIZATION> and who had histologically proven adenocarcinoma, available archived tumor sample, and no history of chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. For these cases, tissue microarray ( TMA<ORGANIZATION> ) samples were examined using immunohistochemistry ( IHC<ORGANIZATION> ). Based on the results of IHC<ORGANIZATION>, cases were selected for detailed examination. We re-evaluated IHC<ORGANIZATION> scores in more than three tumor blocks per case and comparatively evaluated differences in IHC<ORGANIZATION> expression in RTKs<ORGANIZATION> between the mucosal portion ( MuP<ORGANIZATION> ) and invasive portion ( InP<ORGANIZATION> ). Human<PERSON> epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2<ORGANIZATION> ) -, epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) -, and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( c-MET ) -positive rates were 6, 9, and 20 %, respectively. Twenty-two cases were then analyzed to assess differences in IHC<ORGANIZATION> expression levels in the same lesion. Concordance rates of positive staining of HER2<ORGANIZATION>, EGFR<ORGANIZATION>, and MET<ORGANIZATION> between MuP<ORGANIZATION> and whole tumor were 100, 40, and 56 % and those with InP<ORGANIZATION> were 46, 100, and 56 %. To avoid underestimating expression status, biopsies must be taken from MuP<ORGANIZATION> for HER2<ORGANIZATION>, InP<ORGANIZATION> for EGFR<ORGANIZATION>, and both proportions for c-MET.
