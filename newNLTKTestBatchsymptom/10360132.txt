 This manuscript summarizes the literature on mental health outcomes after cardiac arrest. Survivors of cardiac arrest show high rates of mental illness with more than 40 % suffering from anxiety, 30 % from depression, and 25 % from posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD<ORGANIZATION> ). Mental<ORGANIZATION> health outcomes may differ depending on the setting in which the cardiac arrest occurred. A major problem is reduced neuropsychological functioning. Between 30 % and 50 % of survivors of cardiac arrest suffer from cognitive deficits. Deficits of attention, declarative memory, executive function, visual-spatial abilities, and verbal fluency have been observed. As a result of numerous psychopathological symptoms ( depression in 14 % to 45 %, anxiety in 13 % to 61 %, and PTSD<ORGANIZATION> in 19 % to 27 % ) and reduced cognitive functioning ( about 20 % to 60 % ), relevantly reduced quality of life is observed in about 20 % of cardiac arrest survivors.
