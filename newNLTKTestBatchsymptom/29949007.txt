 Adequate<GPE> identification of the severity of status epilepticus ( SE ) contributes to individualized treatment. The scales most widely used for this purpose are: Status Epilepticus Severity Score<PERSON> ( STESS<ORGANIZATION> ), Epidemiology-Based Mortality Score in Status<GPE> Epilepticus ( EMSE<ORGANIZATION> ) and modified Rankin Scale<PERSON> STESS ( mRSTESS<ORGANIZATION> ). The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the STESS<ORGANIZATION>, EMSE<ORGANIZATION> and mRSTESS<ORGANIZATION> scales to predict high disability and hospital mortality at discharge ( HD/HM ). A prospective study was conducted in which total of 41 patients were registered from November 2015 to January 2018 at Eugenio Espejo Hospital<ORGANIZATION>. Clinical<PERSON> variables such as age, sex, clinical status at the beginning of the SE<ORGANIZATION>, initial symptom of SE<ORGANIZATION>, as well as the STESS<ORGANIZATION>, mRSTESS<ORGANIZATION> and EMSE<ORGANIZATION> variant scales were studied at the time of the diagnosis of SE<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 41 patients were evaluated, of which 8 ( 19.5 % ) had HD at hospital discharge and died 13 ( 31.7 % ) during their care. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to predict HD/HM was 0.71 ( 95 % CI ( confidence interval ) 0.55-0.87 ), 0.81 ( 95 % CI 0.67-0.94 ), 0.89 ( 95 % CI 0.79-0.99 ), 0.90 ( 95 % CI 0.80-1.0 ), 0.89 ( 95 % CI 0.78-0.99 ) for the STESS<ORGANIZATION>, mRSTESS<ORGANIZATION>, EMSE-EAC ( etiology, age, comorbidities ), EMSE-EACEG ( etiology, age, comorbidities, electroencephalography ) and EMSE-ECLEG ( etiology, age, level of consciousness at pre-treatment, electroencephalography ), variants of EMSE<ORGANIZATION>, respectively. The binary logistic regression demonstrated how the following cut-off points were determined: STESS OR ( odd ratio ) 4.80 ( p = 0.02 ), mRSTESS<ORGANIZATION> OR 7.89 ( p = 0.00 ), EMSE-EAC OR 22.16 ( p = 0.00 ), EMSE-ECLEG OR 18.00 ( p = 0.00 ), EMSE-EACEG OR 14 ( p = 0.00 ). All of the evaluated scales ( STESS<ORGANIZATION>, mRSTESS<ORGANIZATION>, and EMSE<ORGANIZATION> ) were shown to be useful in predicting HD/HM. EMSE<ORGANIZATION> was observed to be the most effective of the scales, with relative similarities among the variants.
