 What is the central question of this study ? Does inspiratory resistance breathing improve tolerance to simulated hemorrhage in individuals with elevated internal temperatures ? What is the main finding and its importance ? The main finding of this study is that inspiratory resistance breathing modestly improves tolerance to a simulated progressive hemorrhagic challenge during heat stress. These findings demonstrate a scenario in which exploitation of the respiratory pump can ameliorate serious conditions related to systemic hypotension. Heat exposure impairs human blood pressure control and markedly reduces tolerance to a simulated hemorrhagic challenge. Inspiratory resistance breathing enhances blood pressure control and improves tolerance during simulated hemorrhage in normothermic individuals. However, it is unknown if similar improvements occur with this maneuver in heat stress conditions. This study tested the hypothesis that inspiratory resistance breathing improves tolerance to simulated hemorrhage in individuals with elevated internal temperatures. On 2 separate days, 8 subjects performed a simulated hemorrhage challenge ( lower body negative pressure, LBNP<ORGANIZATION> ) to pre-syncope following an increase in internal temperature of 1.3 ± 0.1°C. During one trial subjects breathed through an inspiratory impedance device set at 0 cmH
