 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcomes after revision total hip arthroplasty ( THA<ORGANIZATION> ) using fourth-generation ceramic-on-ceramic ( CoC<ORGANIZATION> ) bearing surfaces. A total of 52 revision THAs ( 28 men and 19 women ) using the fourth-generation CoC<ORGANIZATION> bearing surfaces were retrospectively evaluated. Both acetabular cup and femoral stem were revised in all cases. The mean follow-up period was 7.3 years ( range, 4.0-9.9 years ). The clinical results with Harris<PERSON> hip score ( HHS<ORGANIZATION> ), Western Ontario<PERSON> McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC<ORGANIZATION> ), and radiologic outcomes were evaluated. At the final follow-up examination, the average HHS<ORGANIZATION> was 90.4 ( range, 67-100 ). The average WOMAC pain and physical function score were 2.8 ( range, 0-12 ) and 16.4 ( range, 0-42 ), respectively. Complications were observed in 10 hips ( 19.2 % ). However, there were no bearing surface-related complications, and no cases of dislocation and squeaking. Retroacetabular pelvic osteolysis without cup loosening was observed in one hip at the final follow-up. However, no hip showed radiographic signs of cup loosening, vertical or horizontal acetabular cup migrations, and changes of inclinations during the follow-up period. Our data showed that clinical and radiologic outcomes after revision THA using fourth-generation CoC<ORGANIZATION> bearing were favorable. Hence<PERSON>, revision THA with the use of CoC<ORGANIZATION> bearing surfaces can be preferentially considered. Further studies with long-term follow-up data are warranted.
