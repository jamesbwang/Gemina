 Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the characteristics and health outcomes of college students with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM<ORGANIZATION> ) as it relates to membership in a local university-based diabetes student organization. Methods This descriptive, correlational research design is a secondary analysis of data. The sample consisted of nationally representative young adults in college ( n = 317 ) between 18 and 30 years of age who were diagnosed with T1DM<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> were collected during April 2017 using a secure electronic diabetes management survey to inquire about self-reported barriers to diabetes management, hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis of members of a diabetes organization. Results Students were evenly distributed from freshman to senior year of college with a slight decrease at the graduate level. Students who were affiliated members of a student-led diabetes student organization were less likely to report increased levels of isolation, depressive symptoms, and anxiety related to their diabetes than were general members. Conclusion Participation in a university-based diabetes student organization on campus and connecting with other college students with diabetes may have health benefits. In conclusion, the current study underscores the potential importance of peer-led, diabetes-specific support for adolescents emerging into adulthood.
