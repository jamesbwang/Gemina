 To describe the 5-year findings after a policy to screen for, diagnose, and isolate medical center employees with adenoviral conjunctivitis was implemented. Observational report with a retrospective evaluation of a current quality improvement initiative. Johns Hopkins Medicine<PERSON>, Baltimore<GPE>, Maryland.ParticipantsJohns Hopkins Medicine<PERSON> employees. Data were retrieved from records maintained for this initiative, in which employees with suspected adenoviral conjunctivitis were evaluated in the Occupational Health Clinic<ORGANIZATION> and swabbed for polymerase chain reaction ( PCR<ORGANIZATION> ) testing for adenoviral conjunctivitis. Signs<PERSON>, symptoms, work area, diagnoses, and disposition of employees with eye complaints as well as PCR<ORGANIZATION> result and adenoviral type were recorded. Five-year data were reviewed. From 2011 to 2016, of 10,000 full-time equivalent employees, 1,059 employees visited the Occupational Health Clinic<ORGANIZATION> with suspicion of adenoviral conjunctivitis. Of these, 104 ( 10 % ) were PCR<ORGANIZATION> positive for adenovirus. Of these PCR-positive employees, 26 ( 25 % ) had the worst clinical presentation, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis ( EKC<ORGANIZATION> ). The Outpatient Pharmacy<ORGANIZATION> had the highest number of adenoviral conjunctivitis cases ( n=9 ). The proportion of red-eye employees having PCR-positive adenoviral conjunctivitis increased over 5 years ( P<PERSON> < .005, Cochrane-Armitage test for trend ) as did the proportion of employees with EKC<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). The proportion of employees with EKC<ORGANIZATION> caused by type 37 also increased ( P<PERSON> < .05 ). Adenoviral conjunctivitis represents 10 % of employee cases clinically suspected of this infection. Employees in patient-care areas should be screened even if they have no direct patient contact. Despite increases in the proportions of adenoviral conjunctivitis and of EKC<ORGANIZATION> over 5 years, no outbreaks occurred. This policy helps identify incipient EKC<ORGANIZATION> outbreaks and guides infection control efforts.
