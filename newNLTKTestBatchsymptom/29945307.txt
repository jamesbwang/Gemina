 Immuno-related hemocytopenia ( IRH<ORGANIZATION> ) is defined as idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance ( ICUS<ORGANIZATION> ) patients with autoantibodies. In our previous studies, we found that IgG1<ORGANIZATION> levels were increased in IRH<ORGANIZATION> patients and might cause the destruction of hematopoietic cells. In this study, we analyzed IgG<ORGANIZATION> subclasses in 30 IRH patients ( male: female = 13:17, median age 32 years, range 18 - 56 ), 15 IRH remission patients ( IRH-R ) ( male: female = 6:9, median age 34, range 20 - 52 ) and 20 normal controls ( male: female = 8:12, median age 27, range 24 - 36 ) by Cytometric Bead Array<ORGANIZATION>, Flow Cytometry<PERSON> and Immunohistochemical<ORGANIZATION> staining. Levels<PERSON> of IgG1/IgG3 in the bone marrow supernatant of IRH<ORGANIZATION> patents, as well as the proportion of CD5+ B lymphocytes and Th2<ORGANIZATION> cells ( CD3+CD8-IL-4+ ) were higher than those of IRH-R patients and normal controls, and IgG1<ORGANIZATION> levels had a positive correlation with the proportion of Th2<GPE> cells. In IRH<ORGANIZATION> patients, IgG1<ORGANIZATION> and IgG3<ORGANIZATION> were positive on nucleated erythrocytes and granulocytes, which were negative in IRH-R patients and healthy controls and had inverse correlations with hematopoietic function. Using immunohistochemical staining, IgG1<ORGANIZATION> were also detected on bone marrow biopsies of IRH<ORGANIZATION> patients. The results indicated that IgG1<ORGANIZATION> and IgG3<ORGANIZATION> autoantibodies in IRH<ORGANIZATION> patients might play a key role in the IRH<ORGANIZATION> pathogenesis and in the abnormal immune function of IRH<ORGANIZATION> patients.
