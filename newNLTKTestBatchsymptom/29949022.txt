 The aim of this study was to fully characterize the mechanical behavior of an external hexagonal implant connection ( ø3.5 mm, 10-mm length ) with an in vitro study, a three-dimensional finite element analysis, and a probabilistic fatigue study. Ten implant-abutment assemblies were randomly divided into two groups, five were subjected to a fracture test to obtain the maximum fracture load, and the remaining were exposed to a fatigue test with 360,000 cycles of 150 ± 10 N. After mechanical cycling, all samples were attached to the torque-testing machine and the removal torque was measured in Newton<GPE> centimeters. A finite element analysis ( FEA<ORGANIZATION> ) was then executed in ANSYS® to verify all results obtained in the mechanical tests. Finally, due to the randomness of the fatigue phenomenon, a probabilistic fatigue model was computed to obtain the probability of failure associated with each cycle load. FEA<ORGANIZATION> demonstrated that the fracture corresponded with a maximum stress of 2454 MPa obtained in the in vitro fracture test. Mean<PERSON> life was verified by the three methods. Results obtained by the FEA<ORGANIZATION>, the in vitro test, and the probabilistic approaches were in accordance. Under these conditions, no mechanical etiology failure is expected to occur up to 100,000 cycles. Graphical<PERSON> abstract ᅟ.
