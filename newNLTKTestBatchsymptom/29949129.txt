 Children<GPE> with obesity demonstrate increased risk for eating disorders and internalizing psychopathology. Research in adults indicates unique facets of social anxiety differentially relate to eating pathology. These associations remain understudied in pediatric samples. The current study evaluated associations between social anxiety and disordered eating, and tested the relative importance of distinct social anxiety constructs-fear of negative evaluation, social anxiety in general situations, and social anxiety in new situations-for disordered eating in weight-loss treatment-seeking youth with obesity. One-hundred and thirty-five youth ( M Social anxiety subscales did not correlate with Dieting scores. Dominance<PERSON> analyses indicated Fear of Negative Evaluation<ORGANIZATION> ( FNE<ORGANIZATION> ) evinced complete dominance, thus, emerging as the most important predictor relative to other social anxiety components for Body/Weight Concern and Food<PERSON> Preoccupation. General dominance weights for FNE<ORGANIZATION> accounted for more than twice the shared and unique variance, relative to other independent variables within the Body/Weight Concern and Food<PERSON> Preoccupation models, respectively. Unique<PERSON> facets of social anxiety differentially relate to disordered eating in youth with obesity. Findings suggest nuanced assessment of anxiety constructs, such as FNE<ORGANIZATION>, in pediatric obesity treatment settings may aid in identifying youth at risk for disordered eating attitudes and behaviors.
