 The aim of this study was to compare hormonal stress responses ( changes in adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol concentrations ) to surgical injury during total intravenous propofol anesthesia and volatile anesthesia with sevoflurane in patients subjected to anterior resection of the rectum. The prospective randomized study included 61 patients qualified for anterior resection of the rectum. The subjects were randomized into two groups, based on the type of anesthesia: 1 ) Group I ( TIVA<ORGANIZATION>, n=31 ), administered total intravenous propofol anesthesia, and 2 ) Group II<PERSON> ( VIMA<ORGANIZATION>, n=30 ), administered volatile induction and maintenance sevoflurane anesthesia. Serum concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol were determined prior to surgery, during assessment of abdominal cavity, after resection of the rectum, 30 min and 1 day post-surgery. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of their hemodynamic parameters: heart rate and arterial blood pressure. Compared to individuals subjected to TIVA<ORGANIZATION>, patients from VIMA<ORGANIZATION> group presented with significantly higher concentrations of adrenaline during evaluation of the abdominal organs. No significant intergroup differences were found in terms of intra- and postoperative serum concentrations of noradrenaline and cortisol. TIVA<ORGANIZATION> and VIMA<ORGANIZATION> induce similar hormonal stress responses during anterior resection of the rectum. The increase in serum adrenaline concentration during evaluation of the abdominal organs in VIMA<ORGANIZATION> group implies that the dose of sevoflurane should be escalated at this time point.
