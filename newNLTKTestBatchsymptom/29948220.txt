 No previous study has examined the associations between egg consumption and prevalence of psychological disorders. The present study was conducted to determine the association between egg consumption and depression in a large sample of Iranian<GPE> adults. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 3172 adults in Isfahan<GPE>, Iran<GPE>. Egg consumption was assessed by using a validated, self-administered, dish-based, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The Iranian<GPE> validated version of Hospital Anxiety<ORGANIZATION> and Depression Scale<ORGANIZATION> was used to screen for anxiety and depression. The Iranian<GPE> validated version of General Health Questionnaire<ORGANIZATION> with 12 items was used to assess psychological distress. Depression, anxiety and psychological distress were defined according to standard criteria. The mean age of the study participants was 36.5 Â± 7.9 years. Depression, anxiety and psychological distress were prevalent among 28.4, 13.6 and 23 % of the study subjects, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, no significant association was observed between egg intake and depression ( OR<ORGANIZATION> for comparing extreme quartiles: 1.08 ; 95 % CIs<ORGANIZATION> 0.80-1.45 ) and anxiety ( OR 0.79 ; 95 % CIs<ORGANIZATION> 0.54-1.16 ), as well as psychological distress ( OR 1.03 ; 95 % CIs<ORGANIZATION> 0.76-1.41 ) in the whole population. In men, significant positive associations were observed between egg intake and depression before controlling for BMI<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 1.68 ; 95 % CIs 1.01-2.80 ) ; however, the associations became non-significant after taking BMI<ORGANIZATION> into account ( OR 1.62 ; 95 % CIs<ORGANIZATION> 0.96-2.72 ). We found no significant association between egg intake and psychological disorders. Further studies, in particular of prospective design, are warranted.
