 The objective of this prospective, multicenter, parallel-group, non-interventional clinical trial ( NIT<ORGANIZATION> ) was to characterize the effectiveness of a treatment with the phytomedicines ELOM-080 and BNO<ORGANIZATION> 1016 in patients with acute rhinosinusitis ( ARS<ORGANIZATION> ). A total of 228 patients suffering from ARS<ORGANIZATION> took part in this NIT and were treated for a maximum of 14 days with either BNO 1016 or ELOM-080. Focus<PERSON> was on improvement of rhinosinusitis-associated pain/discomfort and nasal congestion in real-life conditions of primary care setting, as assessed by numeric and verbal rating scale, and five-point Likert<PERSON> scale. The course of the key ARS<ORGANIZATION> symptom facial pain demonstrated a faster recovery in patients with ELOM-080, when compared to BNO<ORGANIZATION> 1016. ELOM-080 tended to be superior for several ancillary criteria and induced significantly higher patient satisfaction with regard to the improvement of feeling of general illness. Physicians assessed both products to be very effective and well tolerated. Adverse<PERSON> drug reactions classified as gastrointestinal disorders occurred in both groups to a comparable extent. This trial demonstrated comparable effectiveness of a therapy of ARS<ORGANIZATION> with the phytomedicines ELOM-080 and BNO<ORGANIZATION> 1016, although the treatment with ELOM-080 resulted in a more rapid and more complete recovery in ARS<ORGANIZATION> key symptoms and tended to be superior for several ancillary criteria. Both treatments were well tolerated. NIS-6471. G. Pohl-Boskamp GmbH & Co. KG.
