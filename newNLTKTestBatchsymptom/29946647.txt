 The present study was aimed to clinically evaluate transitional treatment of pulpitis during pregnancy. Sixty<PERSON> pregnant women with pulpitis were divided into the first, second and third trimester. They were anesthetized locally using STA<ORGANIZATION> system combined with psychological intervention during treatment. The teeth were given one-appointment root canal preparation and filled with vitapex pasta. Normal<GPE> obturation of the root canal was conducted after delivery. The effects of dental treatment, pregnancy outcomes and neonatal health status were observed. Data of the survey were analyzed by SPSS<ORGANIZATION> 20.0 software package, including Student<PERSON> 's t test and chi-square test. The symptoms of pulpitis were significantly improved 24h after treatment, and the effective rate was 96.7 %. The difference of VAS<ORGANIZATION> before and after treatment was statistically significant ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Patients<PERSON> had no discomfort till the end of pregnancy, and the success rate was 98.3 %. No adverse pregnancy outcomes were observed after treatment during different periods of pregnancy. Neonatal<ORGANIZATION> health was good. Significant differences were not found in birth gestational age, body weight, malformations, and neonatal complications between three treatment periods ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). Transitional treatment of pulpitis during pregnancy is a safe and effective procedure and worthy of wide use clinically.
