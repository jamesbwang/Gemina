 The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical efficacy of postoperative non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ( PONIV<ORGANIZATION> ) after pulmonary lobectomy in patients with lung cancer. From August 2010 and July 2015, 143 patients with lung cancer who underwent pulmonary lobectomy were retrospectively reviewed. PONIV<PERSON> was used immediately after surgery until the morning of postoperative day ( POD<ORGANIZATION> ) 1. Arterial blood gas was analyzed before and just after surgery ( POD0<ORGANIZATION> ) and on POD1<ORGANIZATION>. Oxygenation ability was perioperatively assessed by PaO<ORGANIZATION> 112 patients received PONIV<ORGANIZATION>. From POD0 to POD1<ORGANIZATION>, the PaO<ORGANIZATION> PONIV effectively improved oxygenation in patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy in patients with poor status, especially in patients with PaO<ORGANIZATION>
