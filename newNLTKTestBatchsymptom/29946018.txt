 Angiosperms germinated in the dark develop etioplasts, the chloroplast precursors, in cotyledon cells. Etioplasts contain lattice membrane structures called prolamellar bodies ( PLBs<ORGANIZATION> ) and lamellar prothylakoids ( PTs<ORGANIZATION> ) as internal membrane systems. PLBs accumulate the chlorophyll intermediate protochlorophyllide ( Pchlide<ORGANIZATION> ) in a complex with NADPH<ORGANIZATION> and light-dependent NADPH: Pchlide oxidoreductase ( LPOR<ORGANIZATION> ). Two galactolipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol ( MGDG<ORGANIZATION> ) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol ( DGDG<ORGANIZATION> ), are major constituents of etioplast membranes. We previously reported that MGDG<ORGANIZATION> facilitates the synthesis of Pchlide<GPE> and formation of the Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex in etioplasts, but the importance of DGDG<ORGANIZATION> in etioplasts is still unknown. To determine the role of DGDG<ORGANIZATION> in etioplast development and functions, we characterized a knockout mutant ( dgd1 ) of Arabidopsis<PERSON> thaliana DGD1, which encodes the major isoform of DGDG<ORGANIZATION> synthase, in the etioplast-development stage. In etiolated dgd1 seedlings, DGDG<ORGANIZATION> content decreased to 20 % of the wild-type level, the lattice structure of PLBs<ORGANIZATION> was disordered, and the development of PTs<ORGANIZATION> was impaired. In addition, membrane-associated processes of Pchlide<GPE> biosynthesis, formation of the Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and dissociation of the complex after photoconversion of Pchlide<GPE> to chlorophyllide were impaired in dgd1, although the photoconversion reaction by LPOR<ORGANIZATION> was not affected by the DGDG<ORGANIZATION> deficiency. Total carotenoid content also decreased in etiolated dgd1 seedlings, but the carotenoid composition was unchanged. Our data demonstrate a deep involvement of DGDG<ORGANIZATION> in the formation of the internal membrane structures in etioplasts as well as membrane-associated processes of the pigment biosynthesis and the pigment-protein complex organization.
