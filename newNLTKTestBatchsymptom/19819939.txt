 Di<GPE> ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( DEHP<ORGANIZATION> ), a widely used plasticizer, is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and may act as an endocrine disruptor. Early life exposures to DEHP<ORGANIZATION> may result in anti-androgenic effects, impairing the development of the male reproductive tract. However, data on the long-lasting consequences of such DEHP<ORGANIZATION> exposures on adult male reproductive function are still rare and discrepant. Previously, we identified 2 novel plasticizers, 1,4-butanediol dibenzoate ( BDB<ORGANIZATION> ) and dioctyl succinate ( DOS<ORGANIZATION> ), as potential substitutes for DEHP<ORGANIZATION> that did not reproduce classically described endocrine disrupting phenotypes in prepubertal male offspring after maternal exposure. Here, we investigated the consequences of in utero and lactational exposure to BDB<ORGANIZATION> and DOS<ORGANIZATION> on adult male rat reproductive function in a comparative study with DEHP<ORGANIZATION> and a commercially available alternative plasticizer, 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester ( DINCH<ORGANIZATION> ). Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley<PERSON> rats were gavaged with vehicle or a test chemical ( 30 or 300 mg/kg/day ) from gestation day 8 to postnatal day 21. While DEHP<ORGANIZATION> exposure ( 300 mg/kg/day ) significantly increased epididymal weight in the adult, exposure to DINCH<GPE>, BDB<ORGANIZATION>, or DOS<ORGANIZATION> did not affect reproductive organ weights, steroid levels, or sperm quality. Using a toxicogenomic microarray approach, we found that adult testicular gene expression was affected by exposure to the higher dose of DEHP<ORGANIZATION> ; transcripts such as Nr5a2<ORGANIZATION>, Ltf<PERSON>, or Runx2<PERSON> were significantly downregulated, suggesting that DEHP<ORGANIZATION> was targeting estrogen signaling. Lesser<PERSON> effects were observed after treatment with either DINCH or BDB<ORGANIZATION>. DOS<ORGANIZATION> exposure did not produce such effects, confirming its potential as a responsible substitute for DEHP<ORGANIZATION>.
