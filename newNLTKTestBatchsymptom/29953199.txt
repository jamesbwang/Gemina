 Phencyclidine<GPE> ( PCP<ORGANIZATION>, `` angel dust '', an arylcyclohexylamine ) was the first non-natural, man-made illicit drug of abuse, and was coined 'the most dangerous drug in America<GPE> '' in the late 1970s ( amidst sensational horror stories of the drug 's effects ) ; however, few other illicit drugs have had such a significant and broad impact on society - both good and bad. Originally developed as a new class of anesthetic, PCP-derived psychosis gave way to the PCP<ORGANIZATION> hypothesis of schizophrenia ( later coined the NMDA<ORGANIZATION> receptor hypofunction hypothesis or the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia ), which continues to drive therapeutic discovery for schizophrenia today. PCP<ORGANIZATION> also led to the discovery of ketamine ( and a new paradigm for the treatment of major depression ), as well as other illicit, designer drugs, such as methoxetamine ( MXE<ORGANIZATION> ) and a new wave of internet commerce for illicit drugs ( sold as research chemicals, or RCs<ORGANIZATION> ). Furthermore, PCP<ORGANIZATION> is a significant contaminant/additive of many illegal drugs sold today, due to its ease of preparation by clandestine chemists. Here, we will review the history, importance, synthesis ( both legal and clandestine ), pharmacology, drug metabolism and folklore of PCP<ORGANIZATION>, a true DARK<ORGANIZATION> classic in chemical neuroscience.
