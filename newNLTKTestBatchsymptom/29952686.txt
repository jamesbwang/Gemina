 Lumbar<GPE> multifidus impairments are associated with low back pain ( LBP<ORGANIZATION> ), with sustained impairments thought to contribute to recurrence and chronicity of pain. Ability<PERSON> to regain muscle function can be challenging. While neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES<ORGANIZATION> ) may aid in muscle function recovery, validity of its ability to selectively recruit the lumbar multifidus and provide adequate dosage for muscle overload has not been demonstrated. Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS<ORGANIZATION> ) can be used to determine muscle selectivity and overload during NMES<ORGANIZATION> and offers advantages over electromyography ( EMG<ORGANIZATION> ), which is affected by electrical interference. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of NMES<ORGANIZATION> to activate and overload the lumbar multifidus in isolation. EMG<ORGANIZATION> and NIRS<ORGANIZATION> were collected over the trunk extensors during standardized movements followed by delivery of NMES<ORGANIZATION> in 10 healthy participants. NIRS<ORGANIZATION> was used to determine the ability of NMES<ORGANIZATION> to selectively recruit the lumbar multifidus at the L5 region relative to other trunk extensors. EMG<ORGANIZATION> and NIRS<ORGANIZATION> data were then entered into a linear regression model to predict muscle activity during NMES<ORGANIZATION> relative to the standardized movements. There was a significant correlation ( r = 0.81, p < 0.001 ) between EMG<ORGANIZATION> and NIRS<ORGANIZATION> in the lumbar multifidus. There was significantly greater activation of lumbar multifidus compared to lumbar erector spinae using specific NMES<ORGANIZATION> electrode placement ( p < 0.001 ). NMES can preferentially activate lumbar multifidus with potential to provide a therapeutic overload to these muscles in healthy participants. It may be a promising intervention for individuals with LBP<ORGANIZATION>.
