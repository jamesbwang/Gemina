 Several studies suggest in middle-aged subjects a relationship between arterial stiffness, a cardiovascular risk marker, and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA<ORGANIZATION> ). No extensive data are present in older subjects. This study explores this association in a sample of healthy older subjects suffering OSA<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 101 volunteers aged 75.3 ± 0.7 years were examined at the hospital sleep center. Each subject was assessed for medical history, body mass index and 24-h blood pressure measures, biological blood samples, and home polygraphy in 2002-2003 ( P2 ) as well as in 2009-2010 ( P4 ). Arterial stiffness was also assessed using carotid-femoral and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity ( cfPWV<ORGANIZATION> and crPWV<ORGANIZATION> ) during P4 examination. The total group consisted of 59 women and 42 men with a mean apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI<ORGANIZATION> ) of 17.8 ± 12.1 and a mean oxygen desaturation index ( ODI<ORGANIZATION> ) of 9.8 ± 8.9. No-OSA ( AHI<ORGANIZATION> < 15 ) represented 50 % of the sample, and severe cases ( AHI<ORGANIZATION> > 30 ) 17 %. No significant differences had been founded between men and women for blood pressure, cfPWV<ORGANIZATION>, and crPWV<ORGANIZATION>. Considering the severity of the AHI<ORGANIZATION>, no significant differences between groups were present for PWV<ORGANIZATION> and blood pressure values. No difference for PWV<ORGANIZATION> was present for subjects with and without hypertension. No correlation was found between PWV<ORGANIZATION> value and AHI<ORGANIZATION> and ODI<ORGANIZATION> values at P2<ORGANIZATION> or between P2 and P4 visits. cfPWV<PERSON> was higher in patients demonstrating incident hypertension during the follow-up. In this sample of older subjects, PWV<ORGANIZATION> is not affected by AHI<ORGANIZATION> and ODI<ORGANIZATION> but was associated with incident hypertension. These results may suggest potential protective and adaptive mechanisms in older sleep apnea patients. NCT 00759304 and NCT<ORGANIZATION> 00766584.
