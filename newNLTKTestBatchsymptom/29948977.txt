 The aim of this study was to characterise the tongue in wild-type rats using several microscopic techniques. Warsaw Wild Captive Pisula Stryjek<PERSON> ( WWCPS<ORGANIZATION> ) rats belong to a lineage of wild-caught rats. The study was carried out on tongues of 15 male and 15 female WWCPS<ORGANIZATION> rats. Histological, histochemical and ultrastructural studies were carried out. There were no significant differences between the male and female WWCPS<ORGANIZATION> rat tongues. There was a median groove approximately 1 cm long in the apex of the tongue that faded caudally. The intermolar prominence was clearly marked in the distal part of the lingual body. Lingual<PERSON> mechanical papillae located on the surface of the tongue formed four subtypes based on their shape: small filiform papillae, giant filiform papillae, thin elongated filiform papillae and wide filiform papillae. Gustatory papillae formed the second group of papillae and were divided into bud-shaped fungiform papillae, a single vallate papilla surrounded by an incomplete papillary groove and foliate papillae, which were a well-formed and composed of several pairs of folds divided by longitudinal grooves. In the posterior lingual glands ( mucoserous and serous ), acidic sulphated mucin-secreting cells gave a strong AB pH 2.5 positive reaction, and a positive reaction with the AB<ORGANIZATION> pH 1.0 stain for acidic carboxylated mucin. Double AB/PAS<PERSON> staining showed the presence of the majority of mucous cells with predominant of acidic mucins. Positive PAS<PERSON> staining showed the presence of neutral mucin. HDI staining demonstrated a weak positive reaction within Weber<PERSON> 's glands of the WWCPS<ORGANIZATION> rat tongue.
