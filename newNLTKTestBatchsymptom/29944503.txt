 To assess the corneal topometric parameters that can be predictive for better visual gain after intracorneal ring segment ( ICRS<ORGANIZATION> ) implantation in eyes with keratoconus. A total of 42 eyes of 32 patients who underwent ICRS<ORGANIZATION> implantation at Dokuz Eylul University<ORGANIZATION>, Deparment of Ophthalmology<GPE>, Cornea Divison<PERSON> were included. Changes in uncorrected distance visual acuity ( UDVA<ORGANIZATION> ), corrected distance visual acuity ( CDVA<ORGANIZATION> ), refractive errors, and corneal topometric indices measured using Scheimpflug<GPE> topography ( Pentacam<ORGANIZATION>, Oculus<GPE> ) were evaluated retrospectively. After creation of intrastromal tunnels of 5.01±0.03 mm inner diameter, 5.71±0.03 mm outer diameter and at 384.21±34.12 μm depth, 1 or 2 ICRS of 150 to 350 µm thickness and 90 to 210° arc length were implanted. Preoperative UDVA<ORGANIZATION> of 0.09±0.10 and CDVA<ORGANIZATION> of 0.29±0.14 Snellen lines improved postoperatively to 0.42±0.26 and 0.62±0.24, respectively ( P < 0.001 for both ). Preoperative spherical equivalent of -6.35±4.58D and refractive astigmatism of -5.89±2.40D decreased to -3.59±3.86 and -2.25±1.66D, retrospectively ( P < 0.001 for both ). Strong<PERSON> negative correlations were detected between preoperative mean simulated keratometry ( SimKavg<ORGANIZATION> ) /index of surface variance ( ISV<ORGANIZATION> ) and changes in UDVA/CDVA ( P<PERSON> < 0.01, for all ). Postoperative change in ISV<ORGANIZATION> was positively correlated with thicknesses of implanted rings. Change in topographical keratoconus classification was positively and change in index of vertical asymmetry was negatively correlated with number of implanted rings ( P < 0.05 for all ). Preoperative ISV<ORGANIZATION> value seems to be beneficial in predicting visual gain after ICRS<ORGANIZATION> implantation, in addition to SimKavg<ORGANIZATION>. Future<PERSON> work on new nomograms for ICRS<ORGANIZATION> selection that include ISV<ORGANIZATION>, besides refractive, topographic, and cone location data, is warranted.
