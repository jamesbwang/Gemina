 In an effort to produce more stable vaccines for infectious laryngotracheitis virus ( ILTV<ORGANIZATION> ), recombinant strains with deletion of genes associated with virulence have been evaluated for attenuation and protection efficacy. Among viral genes associated with virulence, a cluster of five open reading frames ( ORFs<ORGANIZATION> ; A through E ) have been identified. An attenuated ILTV<ORGANIZATION> recombinant strain with deletion of the ORF<ORGANIZATION> C gene induced protection comparable to that elicited by the tissue culture origin ( TCO<ORGANIZATION> ) vaccine when administered via eyedrop. The objective of this study was to evaluate the attenuation and protection efficacy of the ΔORF<ORGANIZATION> C strain when delivered in ovo to maternal antibody negative ( MAb- ) and maternal antibody positive ( MAb+ ) embryos. In ovo delivery of the ΔORF<ORGANIZATION> C strain did not affected hatchability or body weight gain, while virus transmission to contact chickens was minor. Nevertheless, nine of ninety ( 10 % ) of MAb- chickens vaccinated with the ΔORF<ORGANIZATION> C strain showed marked dyspnea, and upon postmortem examination bloody mucoid plugs and high viral genome load were detected in their tracheas. Moreover, the ΔORF<ORGANIZATION> C strain induced satisfactory protection in MAb- chickens, but marginal protection in MAb+ chickens after challenge. The reduced protection observed for MAb+ groups of chickens was likely caused by the interference of maternally derived antibodies. This report presents the use of a genetically attenuated ILTV<ORGANIZATION> strain delivered in ovo as a potential new approach in the control of ILTV<ORGANIZATION>.
