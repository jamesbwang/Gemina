 Sternal<GPE> wound infections after pediatric cardiac surgery are uncommon but can be morbid. We describe an institutional protocol for complicated sternal wounds utilizing hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBO<ORGANIZATION> ) and negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT<ORGANIZATION> ). A retrospective chart review ( 2001-2013 ) of 4,028 pediatric cardiac operations in 3,264 patients less than 18 years of age. Fifty-three patients ( 1.62 % ; 53/3,264 ) were diagnosed with clinical sternal wound infections. There were 27 ( 50.9 % ) males and 26 ( 49.1 % ) females. Thirty-seven ( 69.8 % ) patients received antibiotics and/or debridement ; sixteen ( 30.2 % ) patients had more complicated infections requiring NPWT<ORGANIZATION> and/or HBO<ORGANIZATION> therapy. The time to heal for wounds treated with HBO<ORGANIZATION> and HBO<ORGANIZATION> + NPWT<ORGANIZATION> was a mean of 43.75 ( Â±24.27 ) days ( range: 21-98 days ; median: 35 days ). Among all infected patients, the time from diagnosis of the infection to resolution of the infection for all survivors was 7 to 98 days ( mean: 26.41 days ; median: 21 days ). Forty-eight ( 90.6 % ) patients completely healed their wounds, and 45 ( 84.9 % ) patients are currently alive. Thirty-eight patients had a cyanotic cardiac diagnosis and 15 had an acyanotic cardiac diagnosis. The most common bacteria isolated from the blood or wound cultures was Staphylococcus<PERSON> aureus. Six of 53 patients died. Causes of death are as follows: three from respiratory failure, one from sepsis, one from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and one from exsanguination leading to cardiac arrest Conclusions: Complicated sternal wound infections after pediatric cardiac surgery refractory to antibiotic therapy and/or debridement can be successfully treated with NPWT<ORGANIZATION> and/or HBO<ORGANIZATION> therapy.
