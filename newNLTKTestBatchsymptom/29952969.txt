 Portal<GPE> vein thrombosis ( PVT<ORGANIZATION> ) is relatively common in patients with liver cirrhosis waiting for liver transplantation ( LT ). Anticoagulation is an important non-invasive treatment strategy for patients with cirrhosis and PVT<ORGANIZATION>. This is the case of a 51-year-old man who presented with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis associated with ascites. Computed tomography ( CT ) and Doppler<PERSON> ultrasonography ( US<ORGANIZATION> ) showed a partially obstructive thrombus of the portal vein ( Yerdel Grade<PERSON> II ). Portal<ORGANIZATION> vein thrombosis ( Yerdel Grade<PERSON> II ) ; liver cirrhosis. The PVT<ORGANIZATION> was completely recanalized after 4 months of treatment with the low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH<ORGANIZATION> ) medication enoxaparin but discontinuation of anticoagulants led to PVT<ORGANIZATION> recurrence. The patient 's condition deteriorated, even though re-treating the anticoagulation with enoxaparin significantly reduced the PVT<ORGANIZATION>. The thrombus was removed by a thrombectomy and LT<ORGANIZATION> was performed successfully without any vascular complications. Patients with cirrhosis and PVT who are waiting LT can be effectively treated with LMWH<ORGANIZATION> anticoagulants. Careful<PERSON> use of anticoagulation is generally safe. Early initiation of anticoagulation treatment may be associated with a high rate of portal vein recanalization.
