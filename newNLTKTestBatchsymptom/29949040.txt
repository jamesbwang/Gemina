 Functional<GPE> and organic impairments of the singing voice are common career-threatening problems of singers presenting in phoniatric and laryngological departments. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of phonosurgery, logopedic voice treatment and vocal pedagogy in common organic and functional voice problems of singers, including investigation of the recently introduced parameter vocal extent measure ( VEM<ORGANIZATION> ). In a prospective clinical study, the analysis of treatment outcome in 76 singers [ 57 female, 19 male ; 38 ± 11 years ( mean ± SD ) ] was based on pre- and post-therapeutic voice function diagnostics and videolaryngostroboscopy. Examination instruments included auditory-perceptual voice assessment, voice range profile ( VRP<ORGANIZATION> ), the VEM<ORGANIZATION> calculated from area and shape of the VRP<ORGANIZATION>, acoustic-aerodynamic analysis, and patients ' self-assessment ( e.g., Singing<ORGANIZATION> Voice Handicap Index ). While 28 % of all singers ( 21/76 ) presented with functional dysphonia, 72 % ( 55/76 ) were diagnosed with organic vocal fold changes, of which marginal edema ( n = 25 ), nodules ( n = 9 ), and polyps ( n = 8 ) were the most common pathologic changes. Of the 76 singers, 57 % ( 43 ) received phonosurgery, 43 % ( 33 ) had conservative pedagogic ( 14 ) and logopedic ( 19 ) treatment. Three months post-therapeutically, most parameters had significantly improved. The dysphonia severity index ( DSI<ORGANIZATION> ) increased on average from 6.1 ± 2.0 to 7.4 ± 1.8 ( p < 0.001 ), and the VEM<ORGANIZATION> from 113 ± 20 to 124 ± 14 ( p < 0.001 ). Both parameters correlated significantly with each other ( r Depending on individual medical indication, phonosurgery, logopedic treatment and voice teaching are all effective, objectively and subjectively satisfactory therapies to improve the impaired singing voice. The use of VEM<ORGANIZATION> in singers with functional and organic dysphonia objectifies and quantifies their vocal capacity as documented in the VRP<ORGANIZATION>. Complementing the established DSI<ORGANIZATION>, VEM<ORGANIZATION> introduction into practical objective voice diagnostics is appropriate and desirable especially for the treatment of singers.
