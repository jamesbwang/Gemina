 Ticagrelor<GPE>, a new type of P2Y12<GPE> receptor antagonist, has been highly recommended to be used in acute coronary syndrome by the latest guideline, but its side effects are not well-known. We seek to illustrate a potential fatal condition, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP<ORGANIZATION> ), caused by ticagrelor. An 87-year-old man who had been prescribed with ticagrelor for 2 months after ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI<ORGANIZATION> ), presented with severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal and liver dysfunction, heart failure and fever. Peripheral blood smear showed schistocytosis, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 ( ADAMTS13<ORGANIZATION> ) activity is low, with normal initial coagulation tests, which were compatible with a diagnosis of TTP<ORGANIZATION>. After cessation of ticagrelor and initiation of therapeutic plasma exchange, our patient recovered. Re-administration of ticagrelor aggravated TTP<ORGANIZATION> and led the patient to death. Clinicians<PERSON> should be aware of the possibility of ticagrelor-induced TTP in patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction ; It is of crucial significance to discontinue and never reuse ticagrelor as long as it is suspected to be implicated in TTP<ORGANIZATION>.
