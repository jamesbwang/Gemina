 Patients with schizophrenia have higher rates of adverse childhood experiences ( ACEs<ORGANIZATION> ) than the general population, and those who suffered multiple traumatic experiences have a higher prevalence of positive symptoms, poorer social functioning and more suicidal ideations and behavior. The current study aims to determine the prevalence of ACEs<ORGANIZATION> in a female patient sample with schizophrenia. An observational descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. Participants included 50 female patients older than 18 years, with schizophrenia. Semi-structured interviews and the Adverse Childhood Experiences<ORGANIZATION> Questionnaire were conducted. We observed that 90 % experienced at least one ACE. Most ( 52 % ) suffered 4 or more ACEs. A high prevalence of emotional abuse and neglect was found and a significant relationship between patients who suffered multiple ACEs<ORGANIZATION> and the presence of suicidal behavior and persistent auditory hallucinations.
