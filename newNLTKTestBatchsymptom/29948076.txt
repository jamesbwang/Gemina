 The purpose of this study was to investigate which feature of the breast-specific gamma imaging ( BSGI<ORGANIZATION> ) uptake in women who were recently diagnosed with breast cancer was associated with malignancy. Data<PERSON> on 231 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who underwent preoperative BSGI<ORGANIZATION> were retrospectively reviewed. Feature<PERSON> analysis was done by classifying BSGI<ORGANIZATION> uptake into mass, non-mass, or focus/foci. Descriptors for mass, non-mass, or focus/foci were shape, distribution, number, and intensity. BSGI<ORGANIZATION> features of known malignancies and lesions that were additionally found by BSGI<ORGANIZATION> were correlated with mammographic breast density, histology, hormonal status, and clinical follow-up data obtained over at least 2 years. Among 372 breast lesions from 231 patients, 241 malignancies had been pathologically confirmed prior to BSGI<ORGANIZATION> and 131 additional lesions were found on BSGI<ORGANIZATION>. Irregular<PERSON> shape was more predictive of malignancy than oval shape ( p=0.004 ) in mass uptake. Linear/ductal distribution was more predictive of malignancy than focal, regional, and segmental distribution ( p < 0.05 ) in non-mass uptake. Mammographic breast density was not associated with BSGI<ORGANIZATION> features. The lesion to normal ratio ( LNR<ORGANIZATION> ) was higher in the postmenopausal patients than that in the premenopausal patients ( p=0.003 ). The feature analysis of radiotracer uptake in BSGI<ORGANIZATION> is useful in predicting whether breast lesions are malignant or benign. • The feature analysis of BSGI<ORGANIZATION> uptake is useful in predicting malignancy. • Irregular shape was predictive of malignancy in mass uptake. • Linear/ductal distribution was predictive of malignancy in non-mass uptake.
