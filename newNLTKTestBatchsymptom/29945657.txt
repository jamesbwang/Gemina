 Maternal<GPE> mortality continues to be of great public health importance, however for each woman who dies as the direct or indirect result of pregnancy, many more women experience life-threatening complications. The global burden of severe maternal morbidity ( SMM<ORGANIZATION> ) is not known, but the World Bank<ORGANIZATION> estimates that it is increasing over time. Consistent with rates of maternal mortality, SMM<ORGANIZATION> rates are higher in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs<ORGANIZATION> ) than in high-income countries ( HICs<ORGANIZATION> ). Since the WHO<ORGANIZATION> recommended that HICs<ORGANIZATION> with low maternal mortality ratios begin to examine SMM<ORGANIZATION> to identify systems failures and intervention priorities, researchers in many HICs have turned their attention to SMM<ORGANIZATION>. Where surveillance has been conducted, the most common etiologies of SMM<ORGANIZATION> have been major obstetric hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders. Of the countries that have conducted SMM<ORGANIZATION> reviews, the most common preventable factors were provider-related, specifically failure to identify `` high risk '' status, delays in diagnosis, and delays in treatment. The highest burden of SMM<ORGANIZATION> is in Sub-Saharan Africa<PERSON>, where estimates of SMM<ORGANIZATION> are as high as 198 per 1000 live births. Hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders are the leading conditions contributing to SMM<ORGANIZATION> across all regions. Case reviews are rare, but have revealed patterns of substandard maternal health care and suboptimal use of evidence-based strategies to prevent and treat morbidity. Severe maternal morbidity not only puts the woman 's life at risk, her fetus/neonate may suffer consequences of morbidity and mortality as well. Adverse delivery outcomes occur at a higher frequency among women with SMM<ORGANIZATION>. Reducing preventable severe maternal morbidity not only reduces the potential for maternal mortality but also improves the health and well-being of the newborn. Increasing global maternal morbidity is a failure to achieve broad public health goals of improved women 's and infants ' health. It is incumbent upon all countries to implement surveillance initiatives to understand the burden of severe morbidity and to implement review processes for assessing potential preventability.
