 This retrospective cohort study investigated the outcomes of patients with unplanned intensive care unit ( ICU<ORGANIZATION> ) readmission.All of the patients readmitted to ICU<ORGANIZATION> within 48 hours between 2010 and 2016 were enrolled.A total of 99 patients early readmitted to ICU<ORGANIZATION> were identified and their mean age of the patients was 68.8 Â± 14.8 years. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of ICU<ORGANIZATION> readmission ( n = 48, 48.5 % ), followed by acute myocardial ischemia or worsening heart failure ( n = 25, 25.3 % ), sepsis ( n = 22, 22.2 % ), gastrointestinal disease ( n = 16, 16.2 % ), and neurologic disease ( n = 11, 11.1 % ). The median length of stay in the ICU<ORGANIZATION> and hospital was 7 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION>, 4-11.5 ) and 32 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION>, 15.5-48.5 ) days, respectively. A total of 34 patients died during the hospital stay and the rate of in-hospital mortality was 34.3 %. Patients with higher APACHE<ORGANIZATION> II scores ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ], 1.17 ; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.33 ), underlying malignancy ( adjusted OR, 4.70 ; 95 % CI, 1.19-18.57 ), and cardiovascular organ dysfunction ( adjusted OR, 5.14 ; 95 % CI, 1.24-21.38 ) were more likely to die.The mortality rate of ICU<ORGANIZATION> readmission patients was high, especially for those with higher APACHE<ORGANIZATION> II score, underlying malignancy and cardiovascular organ dysfunction.
