 Comparisons of communities across cities are rare in social epidemiology. Our prior work exploring racial/ethnic segregation and the prevalence of low birth weight ( LBW<ORGANIZATION> ) in communities from two large urban cities showed a strong relationship in Chicago<GPE> and a very weak relationship in Toronto<GPE>. This study extends that work by examining the association between racial/ethnic minority segregation and LBW<ORGANIZATION> in total of 307 communities in five North<GPE> American<GPE> cities: Baltimore<GPE>, Boston<GPE>, Chicago<GPE>, Philadelphia<GSP>, and Toronto<GPE>. We used Pearson<PERSON> correlation coefficients and OLS<ORGANIZATION> regression models to examine potential variability in the association between racial/ethnic minority segregation and LBW<ORGANIZATION>, controlling for community-level unemployment. In a combined model with community-level data from all cities, a 10 % increase in minority composition is associated with a 0.7 % increase in LBW<ORGANIZATION>. While racial/ethnic minority segregation and unemployment are not associated with LBW<ORGANIZATION> in Toronto<GPE>, these social determinants have strong and significant associations with LBW<ORGANIZATION> across communities in the four US<GPE> cities in the analysis. Subsequent models revealed opposite effects for percentage non-Hispanic Black and percentage Hispanic. Across<PERSON> communities in the US<ORGANIZATION> cities in this analysis, there is considerable similarity in the strength of the effect of racial/ethnic segregation on LBW<ORGANIZATION>. Future<PERSON> work should incorporate communities from additional cities, looking to identify community assets and public policies that allow some minority communities to thrive, while other minority communities suffer from a high prevalence of LBW<ORGANIZATION>. More work is also needed on the generalizability of these patterns to other health outcomes.
