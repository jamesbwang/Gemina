 MiR-338-5p expression is reportedly upregulated in colorectal cancer ( CRC<ORGANIZATION> ) tissues. Clinicopathologic<PERSON> features show that miR-338-5p overexpression correlates with the metastatic status of CRC<ORGANIZATION> patients. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of serum miR-338-5p for CRC<ORGANIZATION>. We obtained peripheral blood samples from 210 individuals, including 80 CRC patients, 50 colorectal polyp ( CRP<ORGANIZATION> ) patients and 80 healthy controls ( HCs<ORGANIZATION> ). Serum<PERSON> miR-338-5p was quantified by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ). Area<PERSON> under the curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) values of the receiver operating curve were used to estimate the diagnostic values of miR-338-5p, CEA<ORGANIZATION> and their combination. The serum miR-338-5p levels in CRC<ORGANIZATION>, CRP<ORGANIZATION> and HC<ORGANIZATION> patients were 4.94 ± 1.13, 4.12 ± 0.75 and 3.07 ± 0.75, respectively. These values were significantly different from each other. The AUC<ORGANIZATION> values of miR-338-5p in CRC<ORGANIZATION> patients were 0.923 ( 95 % CI: 0.882 - 0.964 ) and 0.845 ( 95 % CI: 0.792 - 0.898 ) when compared with those of HCs<ORGANIZATION> and non-CRC subjects, respectively. The AUC<ORGANIZATION> value of the combination of miR-338-5p and CEA<ORGANIZATION> was 0.932 ( 95 % CI: 0.882 - 0.964 ), with a sensitivity of 85 %, specificity of 88.8 %, and cut-off value of 8.16. Circulating miR-338-5p may serve as a potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for CRC<ORGANIZATION> detection. The combination of miR-338-5p and CEA<ORGANIZATION> exhibited the greatest diagnostic value in our study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
