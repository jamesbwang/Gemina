 There is currently no widely accepted classification system of intra-articular damage in the setting of femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI<ORGANIZATION> ). The goal of this study is to correlate the Scoring Hip Osteoarthritis with Magnetic Resonance Imaging<PERSON> ( SHOMRI<ORGANIZATION> ) system with arthroscopic findings in symptomatic FAI<ORGANIZATION> patients to justify its use in this setting. Symptomatic FAI<PERSON> patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were prospectively enrolled. Prior to surgery, radiographs and an MRI were obtained of the affected hip and all patients completed the Hip<ORGANIZATION> disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score<PERSON> ( HOOS<ORGANIZATION> ) questionnaire. Each MRI was graded using the SHOMRI<ORGANIZATION> system. Intraoperatively, cartilage and labral injury grades were recorded. SHOMRI scores were then correlated with the intraoperative cartilage and labral grades as well as preoperative radiographic findings and HOOS<ORGANIZATION> scores. 43 patients were analyzed ( mean age 35.7 years, 58.1 % male ). SHOMRI<ORGANIZATION> total scores correlated with intraoperative femoral cartilage grade ( ρ = 0.42 ; p = 0.002 ), acetabular cartilage grade ( ρ = 0.30 ; p = 0.046 ), and labral tear grade ( ρ = 0.42 ; p = 0.003 ) as well as with preoperative Tönnis grade ( ρ = 0.37, p = 0.013 ), HOOS<ORGANIZATION> pain score ( ρ = -0.33 ; p = 0.039 ), HOOS<ORGANIZATION> ADL score ( ρ = -0.39 ; p = 0.007 ), and HOOS<ORGANIZATION> sports score ( ρ = -0.30 ; p = 0.037 ). In conclusion, total scores from the SHOMRI<ORGANIZATION> system showed significant correlation with arthroscopic findings as well as radiographic gradings and clinical symptoms in patients with FAI<ORGANIZATION>. Use of this quantitative system to assess the burden of chondrolabral damage in FAI<ORGANIZATION> appears valid. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
