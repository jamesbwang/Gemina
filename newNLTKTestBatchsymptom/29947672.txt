 The needle test ( NT ) is a point-of-care test developed in Brazil<GPE> to evaluate the Phosphorus<GPE> ( P ) status in cattle. Based on bone resistance, the NT<ORGANIZATION> is a very inexpensive method which allows the diagnosis of any degree of P deficiency in a fast and simple way in vivo and directly on farm. The NT<ORGANIZATION> measures three levels of resistance in the transverse process ( TP ) of the lumbar vertebrae: a ) TP that are impenetrable and result in warping of the needle ( P healthy animals ) ; b ) TP offering some resistance to the penetration ( animals with subclinical P deficiency ) ; and c ) TP which has minimal resistance to penetration ( clinical P deficiency ). This manuscript presents results from a series of case studies to evaluate the hypothesis that the NT<ORGANIZATION> could be used to assess P status in cattle and assesses the usefulness of results to support decision making on mineral supplementation strategies for grazing cattle. The NT<ORGANIZATION> was able to detect the changes in the resistance patterns of the TP<ORGANIZATION>, as there was reduction or elevation of P levels in the mineral mixtures. The NT<ORGANIZATION> was useful to assist in decision-making for adoption of mineral supplementation strategies better suited for each farm, helping farmers to save money and avoid unnecessary waste of P.
