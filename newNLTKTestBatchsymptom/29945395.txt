 To observe the clinical efficacy of Huazhuo Jiedu<PERSON> formula in treating chronic erosive gastritis ( CEG<ORGANIZATION> ) patients with syndrome of accumulation of turbidity and toxicity, explore its mechanism by observing the changes in expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF-1α ), vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF<ORGANIZATION> ) in serum and gastric mucosa tissues after treatment, and provide theoretical basis for the clinical application of Huazhuo Jiedu<PERSON> formula in treating chronic erosive gastritis. All 70 patient of CEG<ORGANIZATION> were randomly divided into control group and treatment group, 35 cases in each group. The patients in control group received Alatan Wuwei Wan<PERSON>, bid, 1 bag/time ; while the patients in treatment group were given with Huazhuo Jiedu<PERSON> formula, 1 dose/day. The course of the treatment was 6 months in both groups. The changes in clinical symptoms, gastroscopic signs, pathology and the expression levels of HIF-1α, VEGF<ORGANIZATION>, and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten ( PTEN<ORGANIZATION> ) in serum and gastric mucosa tissues were observed in both groups. The results showed that treatment group was better than control group in clinical efficacy, gastroscopic efficacy and pathological effect after treatment (
