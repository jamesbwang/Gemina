 To investigate if complete mesocolic excision ( CME<ORGANIZATION> ) might carry a higher risk of bowel dysfunction and subsequent reduction in quality of life when compared with conventional resection. A cross-sectional questionnaire study based on data from a national survey regarding long-term bowel function and a population-based cohort study comparing CME<ORGANIZATION> ( study group ) with conventional resections ( control group ). 622 patients undergoing elective resections for stage I-III sigmoid adenocarcinoma at four university colorectal centres between June 2008 and December 2014 were eligible to receive the questionnaire in mid-November 2015. Primary outcomes were four or more bowel movements daily, nocturnal bowel movements, unproductive call to stool, obstructive sensation and impact of bowel function on quality of life ( QOL<ORGANIZATION> ). 127 ( 69.0 % ) and 289 ( 66.0 % ) patients in the study and control groups respectively responded to the questionnaire after medians of 4.41 ( IQR<ORGANIZATION> 2.50 ; 5.83 ) and 4.57 ( 3.15 ; 5.82 ) years respectively ( p = 0.048 ). CME<ORGANIZATION> was not associated with: increased risk of four or more bowel movements daily ( adjusted OR 1.14 ( 95 % CI 0.59-2.14 ; p = 0.68 ) ), nocturnal bowel movements ( adjusted OR 1.31 ( 0.66-2.53 ; p = 0.43 ) ), unproductive call to stool ( adjusted OR 0.99 ( 0.54-1.77 ; p = 0.97 ) ), or obstructive sensation ( adjusted OR 1.01 ( 0.56-1.78 ; p = 0.96 ) ). While one in five patients in both groups had moderate to severe impact of bowel function on QOL<ORGANIZATION>, there was no association to CME<ORGANIZATION>. For patients with sigmoid cancer, CME<ORGANIZATION> is associated with neither higher risk of bowel dysfunction nor impaired QOL<ORGANIZATION>. This article is protected by copyright.
