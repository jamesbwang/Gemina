 The present study was performed to detect and characterize the serotypes of fowl adenovirus associated with inclusion body hepatitis ( IBH<ORGANIZATION> ) or hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome ( HHS<ORGANIZATION> ) in commercial poultry in some regions of China<GPE> between 2007 and 2017. Approximately 81 fowl adenovirus strains were isolated from liver or kidney samples from diseased poultry. A sequencing analysis of the hexon loop 1 gene revealed fowl adenovirus serotypes 8a, 8b, and 11 in samples of broilers with IBH<ORGANIZATION>, serotype 11 in layers with IBH<ORGANIZATION>, and serotype 4 in poultry with HHS<ORGANIZATION>. Of the fowl adenovirus serotype 4 strains, 62.07 % were isolated from layers. Additionally, 74.07 % of the isolated strains were fowl adenovirus serotype 11 prior to June 2014 ; 53.70 % were serotype 4 after that time point ; and strains isolated in the first half of 2017 were all serotype 8b, which was related to the widespread application of inactivated serotype 4 adenovirus vaccines. These results demonstrate that fowl adenovirus serotypes 11, 4, and 8b were the predominant serotypes in some regions of China<GPE> between 2007 and June 2014, between June 2014 and 2016, and in the first half of 2017, respectively. Layers were the predominant host infected with fowl adenovirus serotype 4 and could also be infected by serotype 11.
