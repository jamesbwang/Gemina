 Coordination<GPE> networks ( CNs<ORGANIZATION> ), such as, for instance, metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs<ORGANIZATION> ), can turn into remarkable magnets, with various topologies of spin carriers and unique opportunities of cross-coupling to other functionalities. Alternatively, distinct inorganic subnetworks that are spatially segregated by organic ligands can lead to coexisting magnetic systems in a single bulk material. Here, we present a system of two CNs<ORGANIZATION> of general formula Mn ( H
