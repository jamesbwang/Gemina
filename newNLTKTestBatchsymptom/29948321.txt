 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and the safety of a new skin incision for minimally invasive anterior lumbar interbody fusion ( ALIF<ORGANIZATION> ): the perinavel incision. Demographic and clinical data from patients who underwent ALIF<ORGANIZATION> with the perinavel incision were collected. Indications to surgery, preoperative symptoms, radiological data, number of treated levels, intraoperative and early postoperative complications and wound-related problems were analysed. Ninety-seven patients underwent ALIF<ORGANIZATION> with this new skin incision. One hundred fifty-seven levels were treated ( mean 1.7 level per patient ) being L4-L5 the most frequently treated. Intraoperative complications were represented only by the venous injury with a rate of 3.09 % ( 3 cases ). Postoperative complications were all linked to skin incision issues: a case of wound dehiscence and a case of superficial infection. No case of skin necrosis occurs at 3-month follow-up. In this paper, the perinavel skin incision was demonstrated to be as safe as traditional approaches for ALIF<ORGANIZATION>. Furthermore, with this incision it is possible to perform multilevel ( L3-S1 ) ALIF<ORGANIZATION>, which means a good option in minimally invasive surgery as well as revision surgery.
