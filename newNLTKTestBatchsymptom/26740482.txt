 Brugada<GPE> syndrome ( BrS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a well-known catastrophic disease first reported in 1992 by the Brugada<ORGANIZATION> brothers. Ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) is an essential arrhythmia in BrS<ORGANIZATION>. An association between BrS<ORGANIZATION> and atrial tachyarrhythmias is not uncommon. However, sinus node dysfunction ( SND<ORGANIZATION> ) associated with BrS<ORGANIZATION> has not been well discussed. In this review, we focus on the association between BrS<ORGANIZATION> and SND<ORGANIZATION>. Based on previous reports describing clinical, epidemiological, and genetic evidence, SND<ORGANIZATION> is not a rare concomitant disorder in BrS<ORGANIZATION>. BrS may be a multiple conduction or arrhythmogenic disorder including not only the His-Purkinje system and right ventricle, but also the sinus node and atrium, derived from ion channel mutations.
