 Autism<GPE> spectrum disorder ( ASD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that shown a close association with impaired lipid metabolism. The acyl-carnitine spectrum status in Chinese<GPE> children with ASD<ORGANIZATION> has not been reported. In this study, we assessed the levels of blood acyl-carnitines in Chinese<GPE> children with ASD<ORGANIZATION> and examined the relation between acyl-carnitine profiles and the intelligence levels. Blood levels of acyl-carnitines were determined by tandem mass spectrometry in 60 children with ASD<ORGANIZATION> and 30 typically developing children. Chinese Wechsler Young Children Scale<PERSON> of Intelligence<GPE> ( C-WYCSI ) was used in ASD<ORGANIZATION> group. Blood levels of free carnitine, glutaricyl carnitine, octyl carnitine, twenty four carbonyl carnitine and carnosyl carnitine in the ASD<ORGANIZATION> group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Glutaryl<PERSON> carnitine and carnosyl carnitine might be potential biomarkers for diagnosis of ASD<ORGANIZATION>. The changes in the acyl-carnitine spectrum indicate potential mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal fatty acid metabolism in preschool ASD<ORGANIZATION> children.
