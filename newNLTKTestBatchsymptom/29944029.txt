 Persons with subacromial impingement syndrome ( SIS<ORGANIZATION> ) have an imbalance in scapular muscle recruitment. To avoid humeral head compression against the coracoacromial arch during the early stages of rehabilitation, physical therapists recommend movements targeting scapular retraction, shoulder depression, and arm extension such as the inverted row ( IR ) exercise. The purposes of this study were to describe: ( 1 ) scapular balance ratios during an IR and ( 2 ) the magnitudes of recruitment of spinal stabilizer muscles. Scapular muscle balance ratios from 26 healthy participants were calculated from electromyographic ( EMG<ORGANIZATION> ) activity of the upper trapezius ( UTP<ORGANIZATION> ), lower trapezius ( LTP<ORGANIZATION> ), middle trapezius ( MTP<ORGANIZATION> ), serratus anterior ( SA ), posterior deltoid ( PD ), latissimus dorsi ( LD ), and biceps brachii ( BB ) during an IR on stable and unstable support surfaces. Balance ratios were obtained by dividing normalized EMG<ORGANIZATION> activity of the UTP<ORGANIZATION> by the normalized EMG<ORGANIZATION> values from each of the other six muscles. Four median scapular balance ratios ( UTP/MTP, UTP/PD, UTP/LD, and UTP/BB ) ranged from 0.9 to 2.2, whereas the UTP/LTP ratio ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 and the UTP/SA ratio ranged from 1 to 4.7. Activation of seven muscles promoted safe containment of the humeral head within the glenoid fossa during the IR in healthy persons and potentially people with the tendency for development of SIS<ORGANIZATION>. Four spinal stabilizer muscles were examined: longissimus thoracis ( LT ), multifidus ( MF ), rectus abdominis ( RA ), and external oblique ( EO ). Spinal stabilizer EMG<ORGANIZATION> activation values ranged from 34 % to 40 % maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC<ORGANIZATION> ) for the RA<ORGANIZATION> and EO<ORGANIZATION> and from 54 % to 66 % MVIC<ORGANIZATION> for the LT<ORGANIZATION> and MF<ORGANIZATION>.
