 Clinicians providing dialysis care have numerous erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs<ORGANIZATION> ) available for treating anemia. We sought to provide a contemporary description of ESA<ORGANIZATION> types used in hemodialysis ( HD<ORGANIZATION> ) settings in nine European<GPE> countries. Our study uses Dialysis Outcomes<PERSON> and Practice Patterns Study<ORGANIZATION> phase 5 ( 2012-2015 ) data from nine European<GPE> countries ( Belgium<GPE>, France<GPE>, -Germany, Italy<GPE>, Russia<GPE>, Spain<GPE>, Sweden<GPE>, Turkey<GPE>, and the United Kingdom<ORGANIZATION> ). A total of 164 facilities and 3,281 patients contributed cross-sectional data. ESA<ORGANIZATION> types captured included short-acting epoetins ( e.g., epoetin alfa, beta, etc., including biosimilars ), darbepoetin alfa, and continuous erythropoietin receptor agonist ( CERA<ORGANIZATION> ; methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta ). We observed broad variability across countries in prescription of ESA<ORGANIZATION> types: prescription of epoetin alfa or epoetin beta ranged from 22 % ( France<GPE> ) to 78 % ( Russia<GPE> ), darbepoetin alfa prescription ranged from 13 % ( Russia<GPE> ) to 53 % ( UK ), and CERA<ORGANIZATION> prescription ranged from < 3 % ( Sweden<GPE> ) to 26 % ( France<GPE> ). Prescription of different ESA<ORGANIZATION> types varied substantially within some European<GPE> countries from 2012-2015 but not across all countries in aggregate. Number of ESA<ORGANIZATION> types prescribed by a facility varied from 1, 2, 3, or 4 different ESA<ORGANIZATION> types in 32, 40, 21, and 8 % of facilities, respectively. No differences were seen in the unadjusted distributions of achieved hemoglobin values by ESA<ORGANIZATION> type. A variety of short- and long-acting ESAs<ORGANIZATION> are commonly used in European<GPE> HD facilities to maintain hemoglobin at remarkably similar levels with each ESA type. The availability of numerous ESA<ORGANIZATION> options for managing anemia has allowed European<GPE> providers to optimize anemia management according to the particular circumstances of each patient.
