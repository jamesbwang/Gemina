 Dental<GPE> caries have a high prevalence in children and need to evaluate their individual and contextual determinants. To evaluate the importance of individual and contextual determinants on the occurrence of cavitated lesions in 5-year-old children. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 769 preschoolers in a city in northeastern Brazil<GPE>. Parents/caregivers answered questionnaires addressing psychological aspects, socio-demographic characteristics and the child 's oral health. The diagnosis of dental caries ( cavitated lesion ) was performed using the ICDAS-II. Variables<PERSON> related to the context were collected at the preschools and official municipal publications. Unadjusted and adjusted multilevel Poisson<PERSON> regression models with robust variance correction were used. The prevalence of cavitated lesions was 58.8 %. In the analysis adjusted by individual determinants, low household income ( PR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.61 ; 95 % CI:1.27-2.05 ), lower parent's/caregiver 's schooling ( PR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.57 ; 95 % CI:1.20-2.05 ), not visited to the dentist ( PR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.77 ; 95 % CI:0.62-0.94 ), brushing frequency under 2 times per day ( PR<ORGANIZATION> = 2.17 ; 95 % CI:1.35-3.51 ) and weak parent's/caregiver 's SOC<ORGANIZATION> ( PR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.30 ; 95 % CI:1.09-1.56 ) were associated with cavitated lesions. However, after the incorporation of the contextual determinants, parent's/caregiver 's schooling and SOC<ORGANIZATION> lost their association. Considering contextual factors, children attending public preschools ( PR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.66 ; 95 % CI:1.34-2.05 ) and/or smaller preschools ( PR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.001 ; 95 % CI:1.001-1.002 ) had a greater probability of exhibiting cavitated lesions. Contextual variables were more important to the occurrence cavitated lesions than individual socioeconomic variables.
