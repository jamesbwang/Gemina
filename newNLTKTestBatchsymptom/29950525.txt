 Lung<GPE> cancer outcomes in the UK are worse than in many other developed nations. Symptom<PERSON> awareness campaigns aim to diagnose patients at an earlier stage to improve cancer outcomes. An early diagnosis campaign for lung cancer commenced in Leeds<GPE>, UK<ORGANIZATION> in 2011 comprising public and primary-care facing components. Rates of community referral for chest X-ray and lung cancer stage ( TNM<ORGANIZATION> seventh edition ) at presentation were collected from 2008 to 2015. Linear trends were assessed by χ Community-ordered chest X-ray rates per year increased from 18 909 in 2008-2010 to 34 194 in 2013-2015 ( 80.8 % increase ). A significant stage shift towards earlier stage lung cancer was seen ( χ This is the largest described lung cancer stage-shift in association with a symptom awareness campaign. A causal link between the campaign and stage-shift can not be proven but appears plausible. Limitations of the analysis include a lack of contemporary control population.
