 We tested the hypothesis that ( i ) diet associated with exercise would improve arterial baroreflex ( ABR<ORGANIZATION> ) control in metabolic syndrome ( MetS<ORGANIZATION> ) patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA<ORGANIZATION> ) and ( ii ) the effects of this intervention would be more pronounced in patients with OSA<ORGANIZATION>. Forty-six MetS<ORGANIZATION> patients without ( noOSA<ORGANIZATION> ) and with OSA<ORGANIZATION> ( apnea-hypopnea index, AHI<ORGANIZATION> > 15 events/h ) were allocated to no treatment ( control, C ) or hypocaloric diet ( - 500 kcal/day ) associated with exercise ( 40 min, bicycle exercise, 3 times/week ) for 4 months ( treatment, T ), resulting in four groups: noOSA-C ( n = 10 ), OSA-C ( n = 12 ), noOSA-T ( n = 13 ), and OSA-T ( n = 11 ). Muscle<PERSON> sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA<ORGANIZATION> ), beat-to-beat BP, and spontaneous arterial baroreflex function of MSNA<ORGANIZATION> ( ABR No<ORGANIZATION> significant changes occurred in C groups. In contrast, treatment in both patients with and without OSA<ORGANIZATION> led to a significant decrease in weight ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) and the number of MetS<ORGANIZATION> factors ( P<PERSON> = 0.03 ). AHI<ORGANIZATION> declined only in the OSA-T group ( 31 ± 5 to 17 ± 4 events/h, P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Systolic BP<PERSON> decreased in both treatment groups, and diastolic BP decreased significantly only in the noOSA-T group. Treatment<PERSON> decreased MSNA<ORGANIZATION> in both groups. Compared with baseline, ABR Diet<ORGANIZATION> associated with exercise improves baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity and MetS<ORGANIZATION> components in patients with MetS<ORGANIZATION> regardless of OSA<ORGANIZATION>.
