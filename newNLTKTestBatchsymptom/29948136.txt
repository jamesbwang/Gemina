 We assessed short- and mid-long-term clinical efficacy of transanal irrigation ( TAI<ORGANIZATION> ) and its effect on the quality of life of children with spina bifida ( SB ) and anorectal malformations ( ARM<ORGANIZATION> ). Seventy-four pediatric patients ( age 6-17 years ) with SB<ORGANIZATION> and ARM<ORGANIZATION> with neurogenic bowel dysfunction were enrolled for a prospective and multicentric study. Patients were evaluated before the beginning of TAI<GPE> ( T0 ), after 3 months ( T1 ) and after at least 2 years ( range 24-32 months ) ( T2 ) using a questionnaire assessing bowel function, the Bristol<GPE> scale, and two validated questionnaires on quality of life: the CHQ-PF50 questionnaire for the parents of patients aged 6-11 years and the SF36<ORGANIZATION> questionnaires for patients aged between 12 and 18 years. Seventy-two patients completed TAI<ORGANIZATION> program in T1<GPE>, and 67 continued into T2. Bowel outcomes ( constipation and fecal incontinence ) improved in both the SB<ORGANIZATION> and the ARM<ORGANIZATION> groups in the short and mid-long term. In both groups at T1<ORGANIZATION> and T2<GPE>, parents and children reported an improvement in quality of life and there was a significant increase of stool form types 4 and 5 as described by the Bristol<GPE> scale. Common<ORGANIZATION> adverse effects during the study were similar at T1<ORGANIZATION> and T2 without serious complications. We observed a sustained improvement in bowel management and quality of life in SB and ARM<ORGANIZATION> children during the study, more significant in the short term than in mid-long<GPE> term. To maintain success rates in the mid-long term and to reduce the dropout rate, we propose patient training and careful follow-ups.
