 To report a single-center experience with endovascular treatment of ruptured proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery ( PICA<ORGANIZATION> ) aneurysms. Between<PERSON> January 2007 and December 2016, among 1,403 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 15 with ruptured proximal PICA<ORGANIZATION> aneurysms underwent endovascular embolization at our institution. Aneurysmal obliteration with a single microcatheter was performed in 9 cases. Additional microcatheter or stent-assisted coil embolization was performed in 4 cases, with parent artery occlusion in 2 cases. Immediate angiographic results showed 10 complete occlusions ( 66.7 %, 10/15 ). Five cases showed incomplete occlusion ( remnant neck in 4 cases, remnant aneurysm in 1 ). Of these, 2 recurred and required conversion to microsurgical clipping. The remaining 2 remained relatively stable. Procedure-related complications occurred in 3 cases ( 20 %, with thromboembolic complications in 2 cases and intraprocedural rupture in 1 ). Clinical<PERSON> outcome was excellent ( Glasgow Outcome Score<ORGANIZATION> [ GOS ] 4 or 5 in 12 of 15 patients [ 80 % ] ). There was no rebleeding during follow-up. Ruptured proximal PICA<ORGANIZATION> aneurysms may be effectively treated with endovascular coil embolization. A variety of coil embolization techniques are required to obliterate an aneurysm without parent artery occlusion. Since recurrence is possible, follow-up is required. Surgical clipping can be performed for recurrence with relatively low risk of complications, since the aneurysm is unruptured. Coil<PERSON> embolization of a proximal PICA<ORGANIZATION> aneurysm in the acute phase can be a good treatment modality with good patient outcomes.
