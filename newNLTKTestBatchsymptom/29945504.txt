 Thrombocytopenia<GPE> and hypofibrinogenemia during neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB<ORGANIZATION> ) contribute to bleeding and morbidity. Rotational thromboelastometry ( ROTEM<ORGANIZATION> ) is a viscoelastic assay with a rapid turnaround time. Data validating ROTEM<ORGANIZATION> during neonatal cardiac surgery remain limited. This study examined perioperative hemostatic trends in neonates treated with standardized platelet and cryoprecipitate transfusion during CPB<ORGANIZATION>. We hypothesized that ROTEM<ORGANIZATION> would predict thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and the correction thereof. Forty-four neonates undergoing CPB<ORGANIZATION> were included in this prospective observational study. Blood samples were obtained at Baseline<ORGANIZATION>, On CPB<ORGANIZATION>, Post-CPB, and Postoperative. The ROTEM<ORGANIZATION> analysis included extrinsically activated ( Extem ) and fibrinogen-specific ( Fibtem<GPE> ) assays. Platelet-specific thromboelastometry ( Pltem ) values were calculated. Platelet<PERSON> and cryoprecipitate transfusion was initiated prior to termination of CPB<ORGANIZATION>. Platelet count and Extem<PERSON> amplitude decreased significantly On CPB<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < .0001 ), increased significantly Post-CPB ( P<PERSON> < .0001 ), and Postoperative values were not significantly different from Baseline<GPE>. Extem amplitude at 10 minutes ( A10 ) > 46.5 mm ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> = 0.941 ) and Pltem A10<PERSON> > 37.5 mm [ area under curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) = 0.960 ] predicted platelet count > 100 Ã— 10 ROTEM analysis during neonatal cardiac surgery is sensitive and specific for thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia, identifying deficits within 10 minutes. Platelet<PERSON> and cryoprecipitate transfusion during neonatal CPB<ORGANIZATION> normalizes platelet count, fibrinogen level, and ROTEM<ORGANIZATION> amplitudes.
