 Alterations in left atrial ( LA<ORGANIZATION> ) and left ventricular ( LV ) function have been documented in hypertensive patients. However, the correlation of LA<ORGANIZATION> with LV<ORGANIZATION> functional changes has not been established. Using normotensive controls, we examined LA<ORGANIZATION> functional changes in hypertensive patients by strain deformation analysis, and their relationship to LV functional changes including contractile reserve ( CR ). One hundred and sixteen patients ( 61 men, aged 57.6 ± 9.1 years, 67 with hypertension ) underwent dobutamine echocardiography. Patients with significant coronary or valvular disease, previous myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, and diabetes were excluded. LA reservoir ( Ɛs ), conduit ( Ɛe ), and atrial contractile ( Ɛa ) strain were measured at rest. LV global longitudinal strain ( GLS<ORGANIZATION> ) and ejection fraction ( LVEF<ORGANIZATION> ) were measured at rest and at low-dose dobutamine. LV CR was calculated as the difference in GLS<ORGANIZATION> and LVEF<ORGANIZATION> between the low dose and their corresponding resting values. Hypertensive patients, compared with controls, had significantly impaired LA Ɛs<ORGANIZATION> ( 30.7 ± 3.9 % vs 42.4 ± 4.9 % ), Ɛe<GPE> ( 16.2 ± 4.1 % vs 22.5 ± 5.5 % ), and Ɛa<GPE> ( 14.5 ± 4.1 % vs 19.9 ± 5.0 %, all P < .001 ) strain. All LA phasic strain correlated with LV<ORGANIZATION> GLS at rest, at low-dose dobutamine, and LV<ORGANIZATION> CR. There was no correlation between LA<ORGANIZATION> strain and LVEF<ORGANIZATION> or LV<ORGANIZATION> CR assessed by LVEF<ORGANIZATION>. LV GLS and LAVImax<ORGANIZATION> were the strongest independent determinants for LA<ORGANIZATION> Ɛs/Ɛe and LA Ɛa<ORGANIZATION>, respectively. Compared to controls, hypertensive patients had impaired LA<ORGANIZATION> strain, which correlated with LV<ORGANIZATION> GLS and CR<ORGANIZATION>. LV GLS and LAVImax<ORGANIZATION> were the strongest independent determinants for LA<ORGANIZATION> Ɛs/Ɛe and LA Ɛa<ORGANIZATION>, respectively, independent of BP<ORGANIZATION> and LVMi<ORGANIZATION>.
