 The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between red blood cell distribution width ( RDW<ORGANIZATION> ) and mean platelet volume ( MPV<ORGANIZATION> ) with development of postoperative atrial fibrillation ( PoAF<ORGANIZATION> ) after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG<ORGANIZATION> ). The RDW<ORGANIZATION> and MPV<ORGANIZATION> have been associated with some cardiovascular disorders. A total of 93 patients who underwent off-pump CABG<ORGANIZATION> were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups as developing and nondeveloping PoAF<ORGANIZATION> groups in the postoperative period. We measured whether RDW<ORGANIZATION> and MPV<ORGANIZATION> levels are a predictive value for development PoAF<ORGANIZATION>. There were 24 patients with PoAF<ORGANIZATION> enrolled ( mean age: 66 ± 7.8 years ) and 69 patients without PoAF<ORGANIZATION> ( mean age: 56.26 ± 11.53 years ). The PoAF<ORGANIZATION> was significantly correlated with age ( p = 0.004 ), hematocrit ( p: 0.010 ), RDW<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.007 ) and creatinine ( p = 0.006 ). Only advanced age ( p = 0.012 ) was identified as an independent predictor of PoAF<ORGANIZATION>. For predicting PoAF<ORGANIZATION>, there was 79.2 % sensitivity and 65.2 % specificity for RDW<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.001 ) and 62.5 % sensitivity and 55.1 % specificity for MPV<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.062 ). We found that RDW<ORGANIZATION> levels and MPV<ORGANIZATION> were not an independent predictor of the development of PoAF<ORGANIZATION>. However, elevated RDW<ORGANIZATION> levels and MPV<ORGANIZATION> may be one of the predictive values for PoAF<ORGANIZATION> development ( Tab<ORGANIZATION>. 3, Fig<PERSON>. 2, Ref<PERSON>. 27 ).
