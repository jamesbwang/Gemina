 Pregnancy- and lactation-associated osteoporosis ( PLO<ORGANIZATION> ) is a rare disorder with poorly known etiology, pathophysiology, and therapy. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of PLO<ORGANIZATION> and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonates on it. A total of 12 patients were diagnosed with PLO<ORGANIZATION> on the basis of medical history, bone mineral density ( BMD<ORGANIZATION> ), and/or fragility fractures during pregnancy and lactation. We investigated the clinical, biochemical, and radiological characteristics of patients. We assessed the effects of alendronate or zoledronic acid through observing the changes of bone turnover biomarkers and BMD<ORGANIZATION> during the treatment. Secondary osteoporosis was excluded by comprehensive differential diagnosis. The mean age of these patients was 31 ± 5 years old. All of these patients presented severe back pain. Multiple vertebral compression fractures ( VCFs<ORGANIZATION> ) were found in 10 patients, and the median ( P25th<ORGANIZATION>, P75th<ORGANIZATION> ) number of compressed vertebra was 3 ( 3, 5 ). Ten patients had vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Serum<PERSON> level of bone resorption marker ( β-CTX with mean of 0.68 ± 0.41 ng/ml ) was moderately higher than the normal range. BMD at lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip were low as 0.894 ± 0.153 g/cm
