 Dysfunctional cognitions related to trauma is an important factor in the development and maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in children and adolescents. The Child<GPE> Post-traumatic Cognitions<ORGANIZATION> Inventory ( CPTCI<ORGANIZATION> ) assesses such cognitions about trauma. We investigated the psychometric properties of the Korean<GPE> version of CPTCI<ORGANIZATION> and its short form by surveying child and adolescent survivors of sexual violence. Children<PERSON> and adolescents aged 7-16 years ( Confirmatory<ORGANIZATION> factor analysis results supported the two-factor model presented in the original study. The total scale, its subscales, and the short form had good internal consistency ( Cronbach<ORGANIZATION> 's Î± = .96 for total scale and .91-.95 for the other scales ). The CPTCI<ORGANIZATION> showed high correlations with scales measuring post-traumatic stress symptoms ( The results indicate that the Korean<GPE> version of the CPTCI<ORGANIZATION> is a valid and reliable scale ; therefore, it may be a valuable tool for assessing maladaptive cognitions related to trauma in research and clinical settings.
