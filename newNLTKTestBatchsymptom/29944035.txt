 Clerkship-specific interactive reflective writing ( IRW<ORGANIZATION> ) -enhanced reflection may enhance professional identity formation ( PIF<ORGANIZATION> ), a fundamental goal of medical education. PIF<ORGANIZATION> process as revealed in students ? reflective writing ( RW ) has been understudied. The authors developed an IRW<ORGANIZATION> curriculum within a Family Medicine<ORGANIZATION> Clerkship ( FMC<ORGANIZATION> ) and analyzed students ? reflections about challenging/difficult patient encounters using immersion-crystallization qualitative analysis. The qualitative analysis identified 26 unique emergent themes and five distinct thematic categories ( 1. Role of emotions, 2. Role of cognition, 3. Behaviorally responding to situational context, 4. Patient factors, and 5. External factors ) as well as an emergent PIF<ORGANIZATION> model from a directed content analysis. The model describes students ? backgrounds, emotions and previous experiences in medicine merging with external factors and processed during student ? patient interactions. The RWs<ORGANIZATION> also revealed that processing often involves polarities ( e.g. empathy/lack of empathy or encouragement/disillusionment ) as well as dissonance between idealized visions and lived reality. IRW<ORGANIZATION> facilitates and ideally supports grappling with the lived reality of medicine ; uncovering a `` positive hidden curriculum '' within medical education. The authors propose engaging learners in guided critical reflection about complex experiences for meaning-making within a safe learning climate as a valuable way to cultivate reflective, resilient professionals with `` prepared '' minds and hearts for inevitable challenges of healthcare practice.
