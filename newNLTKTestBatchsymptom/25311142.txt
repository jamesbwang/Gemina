 [ Purpose ] This study aimed to investigate the effect of active vibration exercise using a Flexi-Bar on the balance and gait of chronic stroke patients. [ Subjects and Methods<ORGANIZATION> ] Twenty-two patients with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group ( n=11 each ). The experimental group performed active vibration exercise using a Flexi-Bar. Balance<PERSON> was measured using the Berg Balance Scale<ORGANIZATION> and Functional Reach Test<ORGANIZATION>. Gait<PERSON> was measured with the 10-meter Walk Test<PERSON> and Timed Up<PERSON> and Go Test<PERSON>. [ Results<PERSON> ] Intragroup comparisons in the experimental group showed significant differences in Berg<GPE> Balance Scale, Functional Reach Test<ORGANIZATION>, 10-meter Walk Test<PERSON>, and Timed Up<PERSON> and Go Test<PERSON> results, whereas intergroup comparisons showed significant differences in Berg<GPE> Balance Scale, Functional<ORGANIZATION> test, 10-meter Walk Test<PERSON>, and TUGT<ORGANIZATION> results. [ Conclusion ] On the basis of these results, it was concluded that active vibration exercise using a Flexi-Bar effectively improves the balance and gait of patients with chronic stroke.
