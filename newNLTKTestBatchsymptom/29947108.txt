 Various<GPE> studies have assessed the association between E-cadherin methylation and risk of nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC<ORGANIZATION> ) but the conclusion remains unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of E-cadherin methylation on the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of NPC<ORGANIZATION>. Ten studies published up to June 30, 2016, were collected. Odds ratios ( ORs<ORGANIZATION> ) with corresponding confidence intervals ( CIs<ORGANIZATION> ) were calculated and summarized, respectively. The E-cadherin methylation in NPC<ORGANIZATION> was significantly higher than those in normal groups ( OR 16.23 ; 95 % CI 8.34-31.60 ; P<PERSON> < .001 ). Ethnicity-stratified analysis indicated that E-cadherin methylation was strongly correlated with NPC<ORGANIZATION> among both Asians<GPE> ( OR 16.98 ; 95 % CI 8.45-34.14 ; P<PERSON> < .001 ) and North Africans<GPE> ( OR 10.67 ; 95 % CI 1.21-93.72 ; P<PERSON> = .033 ). However, further analysis showed that E-cadherin methylation was not strongly associated with clinicopathological feathers in patients with NPC<ORGANIZATION>. The E-cadherin methylation is strongly associated with the incidence of NPC<ORGANIZATION>, which can serve as an effective biomarker for early detection of NPC<ORGANIZATION>.
