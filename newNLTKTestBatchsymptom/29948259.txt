 Older adults may evidence changes in swallowing physiology. Our goals were to identify dysphagia risk in community-dwelling older adults with no history of dysphagia, and to compare swallowing physiology and safety between older and younger adults. Thirty-two older adults with no history of dysphagia were prospectively recruited and completed the Dysphagia Handicap Index<ORGANIZATION> ( DHI<ORGANIZATION> ), two trials of a 3 oz. swallow screen, and videofluoroscopy ( VFSS<ORGANIZATION> ). Self-ratings of swallowing function were compared to published norms by paired t tests, and multivariate logistic regression models were generated to determine whether these ratings and VFSS<ORGANIZATION> analysis of swallowing function were associated with failure of one or both swallow screen trials. Archived VFSS<PERSON> of 33 younger adults were compared to older adults with Wilcoxon<PERSON> rank-sum tests. The DHI<ORGANIZATION> scores of older adults were higher than published non-dysphagic adults but lower than dysphagic adults. Older participants with greater Oral Residue scores were more likely to fail both swallow screen trials. Older adults received higher median MBSImP™© scores for select pharyngeal components than younger adults. The two age groups did not differ on Penetration-Aspiration Scale scores, and no aspiration was observed. Measures of swallowing in older individuals may reflect age-related sensory and motor changes in the context of functional swallowing and adequate airway protection.
