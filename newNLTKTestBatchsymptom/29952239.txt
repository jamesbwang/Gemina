 Family unification received public and political attention following recent global immigration crises, though less within health research. In Israel<GPE>, under the Family Reunification Order<ORGANIZATION>, about 20,000 Palestinian<GPE> women from the Occupied<ORGANIZATION> Palestinian<GPE> Territories are denied residency and the right to universal health care services ( HSC<ORGANIZATION> ) after marrying Palestinian<GPE> citizens and moving to Israel<GPE>. To better understand the relationship between lacking residency and barriers to accessing HCS<ORGANIZATION>, we conducted in-depth interviews with 21 Palestinian<GPE> women ( ages 22-59 ) denied family unification. Our findings revealed that in addition to hindering access to HCS<ORGANIZATION>, lacking residency intersects with other political, social, and economic determinants of these women 's health and disrupts normal family life. Lacking residency intensifies poverty ( via private health insurance and legal fees, permit extensions ) and leads to family separations and risky crossings at military checkpoints into the West Bank<LOCATION> for medical treatment. Restrictions on freedom of movement engender fear of deportation and precarity. Denial<PERSON> of residency also exacerbates gender inequality ( increased dependence on husbands ) and can endanger child custody when mothers ' lack of residency passes to children, violating children 's basic rights. Allowing family unification to Palestinian<GSP> women would remove barriers to HCS<ORGANIZATION> access, allow normal family life, and permit social integration.
