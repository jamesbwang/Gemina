 Hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system may play an important role in primary premature ejaculation ( PPE<ORGANIZATION> ), and dapoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, plays a role in its treatment. We evaluated the success of dapoxetine treatment in PPE<ORGANIZATION> patients with a penile sympathetic skin response ( PSSR<ORGANIZATION> ). Of 63 patients who were admitted to our outpatient clinic between March 2017 and December 2017 with a complaint of premature ejaculation and diagnosed with PPE<ORGANIZATION>, 56 completed treatment ( minimum 12 tablets ) with on-demand use 30 mg of dapoxetine and returned for a follow-up appointment. Before and after treatment, the International Index<ORGANIZATION> of Erectile Function<ORGANIZATION> ( IIEF-5 ) and Arabic<PERSON> index PE ( AIPE<ORGANIZATION> ) scores, intravaginal ejaculation latency time ( IELT<ORGANIZATION> ), testosterone values and PSSR<ORGANIZATION> values were compared. The IELT<ORGANIZATION> and AIPE<ORGANIZATION> values increased significantly in the 56 patients who were re-evaluated after dapoxetine treatment. No significant changes were observed in testosterone levels and IIEF-5. In the PSSR<ORGANIZATION> measurement, while the amplitude decreased, the latency was prolonged significantly. PSSR<ORGANIZATION> may be an important determinant in the measurement of dapoxetine treatment success for PPE<ORGANIZATION> patients, but additional studies are needed.
