 Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome ( RSTS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by growth retardation, skeletal anomalies and intellectual disability, caused by heterozygous mutation in either the CREBBP<ORGANIZATION> ( RSTS1<ORGANIZATION> ) or EP300<ORGANIZATION> ( RSTS2<ORGANIZATION> ) genes. We generated an induced pluripotent stem cell line from an RSTS2<ORGANIZATION> patient 's blood mononuclear cells by Sendai<ORGANIZATION> virus non integrative reprogramming method. The iPSC<ORGANIZATION> line ( IAIi001RSTS2-65-A ) displayed iPSC<ORGANIZATION> morphology, expressed pluripotency markers, possessed trilineage differentiation potential and was stable by karyotyping. Mutation and western blot analyses demonstrated in IAIi001RSTS2-65-A the patient 's specific non sense mutation in exon 23 c.3829A > T, p. ( Lys 1277* ) and showed reduced quantity of wild type p300 protein.
