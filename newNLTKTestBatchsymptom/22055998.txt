 The same range of blood pressure values may reflect different vascular functions, especially in the elderly. Therefore, a single blood pressure value may not comprehensively reveal cardiovascular function. This study focused on identifying pulse wave features in the elderly that can be used to show functional differences when blood pressure values are in the same range. First, pulse data were preprocessed and pulse cycles were segmented. Second, time domain, higher-order statistics, and energy features of wavelet packet decomposition coefficients were extracted. Finally, useful pulse wave features were evaluated using a feature selection and classifier design. A total of 6,075 pulse wave cycles were grouped into 3 types according to different blood pressure levels and each group was divided into 2 categories according to a history of hypertension. The classification accuracy of feature selection in the 3 groups was 97.91 %, 95.24 %, and 92.28 %, respectively. Selected features could be appropriately used to analyze cardiovascular function in the elderly and can serve as the basis for research on a cardiovascular risk assessment model based on Traditional Chinese Medicine<ORGANIZATION> pulse diagnosis.
