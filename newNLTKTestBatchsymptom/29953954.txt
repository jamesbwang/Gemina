 Various<GPE> risk stratifications in asymptomatic patients with Brugada<PERSON> syndrome ( BrS<ORGANIZATION> ) have been proposed, but the electrophysiological change that promotes ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the changes of ECG<ORGANIZATION> at the onset of VF<ORGANIZATION> compared to ECGs<ORGANIZATION> recorded when patients were still asymptomatic. The subjects were composed of 14 patients with VF<ORGANIZATION> and 48 consecutive asymptomatic patients with BrS<ORGANIZATION>. We compared ECGs<ORGANIZATION> before the initial VF ( > 6 months, early phase ) with ECGs<ORGANIZATION> at the initial VF episode ( late phase ). In asymptomatic patients, we evaluated ECGs<ORGANIZATION> at two time points with an interval of more than 6 months. We evaluated various ECG<ORGANIZATION> markers including type 1 ECG, fragmented QRS<ORGANIZATION> ( fQRS<ORGANIZATION>, multiple spikes within the QRS<ORGANIZATION> complex ). ECG<ORGANIZATION> parameters of the early and late phases were not different except for decreased ST level and low incidence of type 1 ECG in asymptomatic patients. There were no differences in ECG<ORGANIZATION> parameters of the early phase between VF<ORGANIZATION> and asymptomatic patients. In VF patients, ECG<ORGANIZATION> at the late phase had longer QRS<ORGANIZATION> and Tpeak-Tend ( Tpe ) intervals and more frequent type 1 ECG<ORGANIZATION> and fQRS than did ECG<ORGANIZATION> at the early phase. Those changes were associated with initial VF events ( odds ratio [ OR ]: QRS widening: 11.5, p < 0.01, Tpe<PERSON>: 11.6, p < 0.01, fQRS<ORGANIZATION>: 15.3, p < 0.01, type 1 ECG: 6.6, p < 0.05 ). QRS<ORGANIZATION> and ST-T abnormalities developed in association with the initial VF onset. Aggravation of the conduction disturbance in addition to BrS-ECG promotes VF.
