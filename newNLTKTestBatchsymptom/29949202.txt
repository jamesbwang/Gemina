 We report a multiplex family with a GATA1<ORGANIZATION> gene mutation responsible for a massive fetal cerebral hemorrhage occurring at 36 weeks. Two other stillbirth cousins presented with fetal hydrops and congenital hemochromatosis ' phenotype at 37 and 12 weeks of gestation. Molecular screening revealed the presence of a c.613G > A pathogenic allelic variation in exon 4 of GATA1<ORGANIZATION> gene in the three male siblings and their carrier mothers. The diagnosis of a GATA1<ORGANIZATION> gene mutation may be suspected in cases of male fetuses with intracerebral bleeding, particularly if a history of prior fetal loss ( es ) and mild maternal thrombocytopenia are also present.
