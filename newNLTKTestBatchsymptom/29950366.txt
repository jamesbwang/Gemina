 Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy ( NAION<ORGANIZATION> ) may develop due to severe anaemia and hypotension which is seen in acute blood loss. The devastating visual loss is often irreversible. We report a case of NAION<ORGANIZATION> in a 20-year-old healthy woman, who presented on the third day of a heavy menstrual cycle with hypovolaemic shock. On day 2 of admission, she had sudden right eye blurring of vision at the superior field on awakening from sleep. Funduscopy<PERSON> revealed a pale and swollen right optic disc. There was a dense right superior altitudinal visual field defect. Her haemoglobin level was low ( 3.6 g/dL ), but she refused blood transfusion due to her religious belief ( Jehovah<PERSON> 's Witness ) and opted for conservative management. She later developed right optic atrophy with persistent visual field defect despite an improved haemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL.
