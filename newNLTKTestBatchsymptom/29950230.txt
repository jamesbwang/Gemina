 To explore the relationship between driver mutations and clinical characteristics in patients with Philadelphia<GSP> chromosome ( Ph ) negative myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPN<ORGANIZATION> ), so as to provide evidence for diagno-sis and treatment of the disease. The clinical data of 410 patients with classic Ph negative MPN including 150 cases of polycythemia vera ( PV ), 188 cases of essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) and 72 cases of primary myelofibrosis ( PMF<ORGANIZATION> ) from January 2013 to December 2016 in Fujian<GPE> Medical University Union Hospital<ORGANIZATION> were retrospectively analyzed. The PCR<ORGANIZATION> or DNA<ORGANIZATION> sequencing were used for JAK2 V617F<ORGANIZATION>, JAK2<ORGANIZATION> exon12, CALR<ORGANIZATION> and MPL<ORGANIZATION> W515L/K mutation analyses, and follow-up information on patients was updated by direct phone call or follow-up in outpatient. Among the 410 patients with Ph negative MPN<ORGANIZATION>, 136 ( 33.2 % ) cases were asymptomatic at diagnosis. 389 cases were sequenced and JAK2 V617F<ORGANIZATION> was detected in 87.1 % ( 122/140 ) of PV<ORGANIZATION>, 64.1 % ( 118/184 ) of ET<ORGANIZATION>, 64.6 % ( 42/65 ) of PMF<ORGANIZATION> ; JAK2<ORGANIZATION> exon 12 mutation in 1 case of PV<GPE> ; MPL<ORGANIZATION> W515L/K mutation in 1 case of ET<ORGANIZATION> and PMF<ORGANIZATION>, respectively ; CALR<ORGANIZATION> mutation in 18 ( 9.8 % ) cases of ET<ORGANIZATION> and 5 ( 7.7 % ) cases of PMF<ORGANIZATION>. JAK2 V617F<ORGANIZATION> mutated PV patients ocourred in older age: the white blood cell count, platelet count and incidence of splenomegaly were higher than JAK2-negative PV cases ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Compared with JAK2 V617F<ORGANIZATION> mutated ET patients, CALR<ORGANIZATION> mutated ET cases displayed younger age, lower leukocyte count, higher platelet count and lower incidence of thrombosis ; JAK2-negative ET cases had younger age, lower leukocyte count, lower hemoglobin level, higher platelet count and lower incidence of thrombosis ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). The incidence of splenomegaly in JAK2 V617F<ORGANIZATION> or CALR<ORGANIZATION> mutated PMF<ORGANIZATION> patients was both higher than that in JAK2-negative PMF<ORGANIZATION> cases, but the incidence of leukemia transformation in JAK2-negative PMF<ORGANIZATION> patients was higher than that in JAK2 V617F<ORGANIZATION> mutated cases ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). The types of driver mutations are closely related with the clinical features and prognosis in Ph<GPE>
