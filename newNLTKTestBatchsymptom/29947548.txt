 The aging of America<GPE> will include a significant increase in the number of older patients with cancer, many of whom will experience significant depressive symptoms. Although geriatric depression is a well-studied construct, its symptom presentation in the context of cancer is less clear. Latent profile analysis was conducted on depressive symptoms in younger ( 40-64 years ) and older ( â‰¥65 years ) patients with cancer ( N = 636 ). The sample was clinically heterogeneous ( i.e., included all stages, dominated by advanced stage disease ). Participants<PERSON> completed questionnaires including the Center<ORGANIZATION> for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale<ORGANIZATION>, which was used for the latent profile analysis. A four-class pattern was supported for each age group. However, the four-class pattern was significantly different between the younger and older groups in terms of the item means within each corresponding latent class ; differences were primarily driven by severity such that across classes, older adults endorsed milder symptoms. An unexpected measurement issue was uncovered regarding reverse-coded items, suggesting that they may generate unreliable scores on the Center<ORGANIZATION> for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale<ORGANIZATION> for a significant subset of patients. The results indicate that cancer clinicians can expect to see depressive symptoms along a continuum of severity for patients of any age, with less severe symptoms among older patients.
