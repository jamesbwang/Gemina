 The value of indocyanine green ( ICG<ORGANIZATION> ) test is negatively affected in patients with intrahepatic shunt, ICG<ORGANIZATION> excretory defect, or jaundice. This study evaluated Thirteen hepatectomy candidates with ICG<ORGANIZATION> retention rates over 40 % were retrospectively analyzed. The ICG<ORGANIZATION> clearance rate ( KICG<ORGANIZATION> ) and estimated KICG<ORGANIZATION> obtained by KGSA<ORGANIZATION> values were significantly greater than KICG<ORGANIZATION> values ( median: 0.12 vs. 0.059 ; p < 0.01 ) ; remKGSA<ORGANIZATION> values were greater than remKICG<ORGANIZATION> values in all patients ( median: 0.107 vs. 0.0413 ; p < 0.01 ). Hepatectomy<PERSON> was considered unsafe in 70 % patients using remKICG<ORGANIZATION>, and in none of those using remKGSA<ORGANIZATION> ; liver failure or postoperative mortality did not occur. None
