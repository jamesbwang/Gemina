 The time and conditions may not be suitable for performing polysomnography ( PSG<ORGANIZATION> ) before urgent or emergent surgeries, for example, a coronary artery bypass graft. Unavailability in many centers, critical clinical situation, and inability to arrange a timely scheduled appointment are other limitations for PSG<ORGANIZATION>. In this study, we aimed to investigate if the STOPBANG Questionnaire<ORGANIZATION> may predict obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS<ORGANIZATION> ) related postoperative pulmonary alterations during coronary artery surgery. Sixty-one subjects who were scheduled to undergo elective isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery and were consulted for preoperative pulmonary assessment were recruited to the study. The STOP-BANG Questionnaire was used with the subjects ; then their relationship with postoperative complications was assessed. Results of the STOP-BANG Questionnaire revealed that 36.1 % of subjects were at high risk for OSAS<ORGANIZATION>. Three groups were established according to the STOP-BANG Questionnaire ( low risk, group 1 ; moderate risk, group 2 ; high risk, group 3 ) and study parameters, including PEEP<ORGANIZATION> value in ventilator, detection of apnea at ventilator, CPAP<ORGANIZATION> time after extubation, S The STOP-BANG Questionnaire may predict the OSAS<ORGANIZATION> risk and OSAS-related pulmonary complications for patients who are candidates for a coronary artery bypass graft and unable to be evaluated with PSG<ORGANIZATION> before surgery due to technical or time-related limitations.
