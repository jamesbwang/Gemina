 The study aimed to investigate the relationship between the spontaneous passage of distal ureteral stones and ureteral jet flow measurement. The study included 74 patients with acute renal colic between June 2015 and June 2016, and distal ureteral stones of 10 mm or less in a non-contrast CT were comprised in a prospective study. The ureteral jet was measured by Doppler<PERSON> ultrasonography. At the fourth week follow-up, kidney-ureter-bladder radiography was taken and the patients who no longer had a stone were considered to have spontaneously passed it. The average stone size of the patients was 5.6 Â± 2.0 mm. After 4 weeks of follow-up, 55 patients ( 74.3 % ) had passed the stone spontaneously whereas 19 ( 25.6 % ) had not. The patients in the former group were found to have a higher peak flow velocity of ureteral jet on the stone side than those in the latter group. In regression analysis ureteral jet on the stone side was independently associated with spontaneous passage ( p = 0.027 ). For the spontaneous passage, a ureteral jet flow peak velocity above 15.25 cm/s had an 85.4 % sensitivity and 63.1 % specificity. Measurement of the ureteral jet flow peak velocity can be beneficial in predicting the potential spontaneous passage of distal ureteral stones.
