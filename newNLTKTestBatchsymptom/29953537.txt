 Perceived social support relates to infertility-related distress in couples undergoing assisted reproductive technology ( ART<ORGANIZATION> ) treatment. Studies examining the effect of other support types on both positive and negative adjustment among infertile couples are scarce or non-existent. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of support receipt, provision, invisibility ( the discrepancy between one partner 's received and the other partner 's provided support ), and equity ( the discrepancy between each partner 's received and provided support ) on the positive ( life purpose ) and negative ( depressive symptoms ) indices of well-being in couples undergoing ART<ORGANIZATION> treatment. Depressive symptoms ( CES-D ), life purpose ( PIL<ORGANIZATION> ), and social support ( BSSS<ORGANIZATION> ) were assessed among 31 married couples ( mean age 32.67 years ) undergoing ART<ORGANIZATION> treatment. Data were analyzed by applying the Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model ( APIM<ORGANIZATION> ) using multilevel modeling. Both receiving and providing support had beneficial effects in women and men. However, sub-analysis showed differences according to gender and the support exchange effects. Women<PERSON> reported higher depression and lower life purpose but benefited more from support, and their well-being was more dependent on their own perception of support provision and receipt. Men<PERSON> demonstrated higher adjustment to infertility but benefited less from support, and their well-being was mostly correlated with supportive behaviors of their wives. Adjustment mechanisms of women and men undergoing ART<ORGANIZATION> treatment vary considerably ; thus, gender should be taken into consideration in interventions. Future studies should focus on costs/benefits and gender differences of visible and invisible support in infertility settings.
