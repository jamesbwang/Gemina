 The purpose of the current study was to investigate the mediatory role between vigorous physical activity, body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ), and cardiorespiratory fitness on symptoms of depression and their subsequent direct and indirect effects on quality of life ( QoL<ORGANIZATION> ). Five hundred and seventy-six adolescents ' ( 314 boys, 12.5 ± 1.1 years ) physical activity levels, cardiorespiratory fitness, BMI<ORGANIZATION>, levels of depressive symptoms, and QoL<ORGANIZATION> were measured. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the difference in linear structural associations between variables. The model suggested that cardiorespiratory fitness ( β = 0.16, p < 0.001 ) and symptoms of depression ( β = - 0.52, p < 0.001 ) were both directly associated with physical QoL<ORGANIZATION>, with depressive symptoms also directly influencing psychological QoL<ORGANIZATION> ( β = - 0.79, p < 0.01 ). Body mass index was indirectly associated with physical QoL<ORGANIZATION>, mediated by both symptoms of depression ( β = - 0.06, p < 0.001 ) and cardiorespiratory fitness ( β = 0.05, p < 0.001 ) and psychological QoL<ORGANIZATION> mediated by symptoms of depression ( β = - 0.09, p < 0.001 ). Vigorous physical activity was indirectly associated with QoL<ORGANIZATION>, mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness ( β = - 0.04, p < 0.001 ). Models<PERSON> suggested that vigorous physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and BMI<ORGANIZATION> were associated, both directly and indirectly, with mental well-being and QoL<ORGANIZATION>. It could, therefore, be postulated that enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness and BMI<ORGANIZATION> through increasing vigorous physical activity may be beneficial to both mental well-being and QoL<ORGANIZATION> in adolescents.
