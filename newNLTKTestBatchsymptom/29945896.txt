 To investigate the incidence, clinical features and risk factors of premacular membrane ( PMM<ORGANIZATION> ) formation after primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment ( RRD<ORGANIZATION> ) repair with scleral buckling ( SB ) alone. This institutional, prospective and consecutive case series included phakic eyes with RRD<ORGANIZATION>, treated with SB<ORGANIZATION> alone within 7 days from the occurrence of symptoms, with a follow-up of 6 months. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images were reviewed. The association of PMM<ORGANIZATION> development and morphology with preoperative and intraoperative RRD<ORGANIZATION> features was analysed. Ninety-two patients with a mean age of 56±13 years completed the 6 months follow-up period. Postoperatively, eyes with any PMM stage were 30 out of 92 ( 32.6 % ) at 1 month and 47 out of 92 ( 51,1 % ) at both 3 months and 6 months. Over the follow-up period, 17 out of 47 PMMs ( 36.2 % ) progressed to later stages. Progression of PMMs<ORGANIZATION> to later stages were observed only in RRDs<ORGANIZATION> involving the macular region ( 17 out of 35 eyes, 48.5 % ), while none of the PMMs<ORGANIZATION> in macula-sparing detachments progressed to later stages ( p=0.020 ). The risk factors significantly associated with postoperative new onset of PMM<ORGANIZATION> were preoperative RRDs involving the macular region ( p=0.001 ), cryopexy time ( p=0.045 ), presence of horseshoe tears ( p=0.003 ), worse preoperative visual acuity ( p=0.004 ) and subretinal fluid drainage ( p=0.047 ). The incidence of postoperative PMM<ORGANIZATION> formation after RRD<ORGANIZATION> repair with SB<ORGANIZATION> alone was high. In retinal detachments involving the macular region PMM<ORGANIZATION> were more severe, tending to anatomical progression and functional deterioration. Activation of foveal Müller<PERSON> cell in detachments involving the macula may be a key factor in PMM<ORGANIZATION> progression.
