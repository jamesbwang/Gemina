 Mitochondrial oxidative flashes ( mitoflashes ) are oxidative burst events in mitochondria. It is crosslinked with numerous mitochondrial molecular processes and related with pivotal cell functions such as apoptosis and respiration. In previous research, mitoflashes were found as spontaneous occasional events. It would be observed more frequently if cells were treated with proapoptotic chemicals. We show that multiple mitoflashes can be initiated by a single femtosecond-laser stimulation that was tightly focused on a diffraction-limited spot in the mitochondrial tubular structure. The mitoflash events triggered by different photostimulations are quantified and analyzed. The width and amplitude of mitoflashes are found very sensitive to stimulation parameters including laser power, exposure duration, and total incident laser energy. This study provides a quantitative investigation on the photostimulated mitoflashes. It may thus demonstrate such optical method to be a promising technique in future mitochondrial research.
