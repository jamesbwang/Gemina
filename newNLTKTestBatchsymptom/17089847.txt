 For positioning a moving target, a maximum intensity projection ( MIP<ORGANIZATION> ) or average intensity projection ( AIP<ORGANIZATION> ) image derived from 4DCT is often used as the reference image which is matched to free breathing cone-beam CT ( FBCBCT<ORGANIZATION> ) before treatment. This method can be highly accurate if the respiratory motion of the patient is stable. However, a patient 's breathing pattern is often irregular. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of irregular respiration on positioning accuracy for a moving target aligned with FBCBCT<ORGANIZATION>. Nine patients ' respiratory motion curves were selected to drive a Quasar<GPE> motion phantom with one embedded cubic and two spherical targets. A 4DCT of the phantom was acquired on a CT scanner ( Philips Brilliance<PERSON> 16 ) equipped with a Varian<GPE> RPM<ORGANIZATION> system. The phase binned 4DCT images and the corresponding MIP<ORGANIZATION> and AIP<ORGANIZATION> images were transferred into Eclipse<GPE> for analysis. FBCBCTs<ORGANIZATION> of the phantom driven by the same respiratory curves were also acquired on a Varian<GPE> TrueBeam<ORGANIZATION> and fused such that both CBCT<ORGANIZATION> and MIP/AIP images share the same target zero positions. The sphere and cube volumes and centroid differences ( alignment error ) determined by MIP<ORGANIZATION>, AIP<ORGANIZATION> and FBCBCT<ORGANIZATION> images were calculated, respectively. Compared to the volume determined by MIP<ORGANIZATION>, the volumes of the cube, large sphere, and small sphere in AIP<ORGANIZATION> and FBCBCT<ORGANIZATION> images were smaller. The alignment errors for the cube, large sphere and small sphere with center to center matches between MIP<ORGANIZATION> and FBCBCT<ORGANIZATION> were 2.5 ± 1.8mm, 2.4±2.1 mm, and 3.8±2.8 mm, and the alignment errors between AIP<ORGANIZATION> and FBCBCT<ORGANIZATION> were 0.5±1.1mm, 0.3±0.8mm, and 1.8±2.0 mm, respectively. AIP<ORGANIZATION> images appear to be superior reference images to MIP<ORGANIZATION> images. However, irregular respiratory pattern could compromise the positioning accuracy, especially for smaller targets.
