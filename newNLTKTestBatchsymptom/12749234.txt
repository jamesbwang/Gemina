 Gastric<GPE> cancer is the second most common malignancy, overlapping with thoracic esophageal cancer ( TEC<ORGANIZATION> ). Among them, metachronous gastric tube cancers after TEC<ORGANIZATION> surgery have been increasing. The aims of this study were to examine the clinicopathological factors and treatment outcomes of gastric tube cancer ( GTC<ORGANIZATION> ) after TEC<ORGANIZATION> surgery. Thirty-three GTCs<ORGANIZATION> in 30 cases after TEC<ORGANIZATION> treated between 1997 and 2016 were investigated retrospectively. Most cases were males. The median interval from TEC<ORGANIZATION> surgery to GTC<ORGANIZATION> occurrence was 57 ( 6.5-107.5 ) months. Almost 2/3 lesions occurred in the lower third of the gastric tube ( 21/33 ) ; 29 lesions ( in 26 cases ) were superficial cancers, and 4 lesions were advanced cancers. Twenty-two lesions of superficial cancer were differentiated type, and the remaining seven lesions were undifferentiated type. Treatment for superficial cancer had previously been performed with partial gastric tube resection ( 10 lesions ), and the number of cases undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD<ORGANIZATION> ) had increased recently ( 19 lesions ). Most cases with superficial cancer survived without relapse. Four lesions of advanced cancer were found after a relatively long interval following TEC<ORGANIZATION> surgery. Most lesions of advanced cancer were scirrhous, undifferentiated type, and they died due to GTC<ORGANIZATION>. GTCs<ORGANIZATION> may occur late in the postoperative course following TEC<ORGANIZATION> surgery. If they are discovered at an early stage, these lesions can be cured with ESD<ORGANIZATION>. Long-term periodic endoscopic examinations after TEC<ORGANIZATION> surgery are important.
