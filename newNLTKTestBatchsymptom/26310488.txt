 We investigated the distinguishing pathological features of bilateral ovarian tumors using magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging. Eighty-six patients with bilateral ovarian tumors on MR imaging were evaluated. The pathological diagnosis was investigated, and the results were subjected to statistical analysis using Mann-Whitney The diagnosis of bilateral ovarian tumors was confirmed in eighty-one patients and the majority of the lesions were further classified into serous carcinoma ( Within our patient cohort, most bilateral ovarian tumor lesions were determined to be serous carcinoma, mature teratoma or metastasis. CA 125 serum level and maximum tumor diameter are useful markers for the differentiation between metastasis and serous carcinoma or primary malignant ovarian tumors.
