 Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT<ORGANIZATION> ) was developed to prevent relapse in individuals with depressive disorders. This widely used intervention has garnered considerable attention and a comprehensive review of current trends is warranted. As such, this review provides an overview of efficacy, mechanisms of action, and concludes with a discussion of dissemination. Results<PERSON> provided strong support for the efficacy of MBCT<ORGANIZATION> despite some methodological shortcomings in the reviewed literature. With respect to mechanisms of action, specific elements, such as mindfulness, repetitive negative thinking, self-compassion and affect, and cognitive reactivity have emerged as important mechanisms of change. Finally, despite a lack of widespread MBCT<ORGANIZATION> availability outside urban areas, research has shown that self-help variations are promising. Combined with findings that teacher competence may not be a significant predictor of treatment outcome, there are important implications for dissemination. Taken together, this review shows that while MBCT<ORGANIZATION> is an effective treatment for depression, continued research in the areas of efficacy, mechanisms of action, and dissemination are recommended.
