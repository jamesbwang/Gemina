 An 8-week feeding trial was performed to assess the effects of dietary white button mushroom ( Agaricus<ORGANIZATION> bisporus ) powder ( WBMP<ORGANIZATION> ) on the mucosal immunity and growth of rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ). Trout ( n = 192 ; weight 13.76 ± 1.17 g ) were stocked in 12 cages ( 65 × 65 × 65 cm ) placed in 4 raceways with a flow-through water system. Trout<PERSON> were fed a basal diet ( control group ) or a basal diet supplemented with 0.5 %, 1 %, or 2 % WBMP<ORGANIZATION> for 8 weeks. Evaluation of total protein levels and lysozyme activity in skin mucus revealed noticeable increases in trout fed 1 % or 2 % WBMP<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), but no significant difference was observed with 0.5 % WBMP<ORGANIZATION> administration ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). The results of sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed alterations in the protein profile of skin mucus following dietary administration of WBMP<ORGANIZATION>. Molecular studies showed a noticeable increase ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) in tumor necrosis factor-α messenger RNA in the intestine of WBMP-fed trout, regardless of the inclusion level. Also, fish receiving the 1 % or 2 % WBMP<ORGANIZATION> treatments had a remarkable increase in interleukin ( IL ) -1β expression compared with the control group ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). In a similar way, intestinal IL-8 expression was upregulated with the 1 % and 2 % WBMP<ORGANIZATION> treatments ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). However, no significant difference was found between the control group and the 0.5 % WBMP<ORGANIZATION> treatment group in the case of IL-8 gene expression ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). Furthermore, after 8 weeks of WBMP<ORGANIZATION> feeding, no improvement was seen in the growth parameters of trout compared with those fish fed the nonsupplemented diet ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). These results hint at the potential immunomodulatory effects of dietary WBMP<ORGANIZATION>.
