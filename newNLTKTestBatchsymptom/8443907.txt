 Concealed accessory pathways ( APs<ORGANIZATION> ) are considered benign as they can only sustain orthodromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia ( ORT<ORGANIZATION> ). We describe a unique case of a concealed posteroseptal AP<ORGANIZATION> where longitudinal surveillance following repeated failed ablation attempts due to abnormal coronary sinus ( CS ) anatomy revealed spontaneous development of manifest pre-excitation. The pathway was ultimately ablated via the percutaneous epicardial approach. The potential for development of Wolff-Parkinson-White ( WPW<ORGANIZATION> ) syndrome in patients with concealed APs<ORGANIZATION> has implications for ongoing surveillance in these patients.
