 Background<PERSON> Infantile hepatic haemangiomas ( IHHs<ORGANIZATION> ) produce an excess of the thyroid hormone inactivating enzyme type-3 iodothyronine deiodinase ( D3 ), leading to rapid degradation of thyroid hormones and consumptive hypothyroidism. The L-thyroxine replacement dose in patients with consumptive hypothyroidism is inappropriately higher than that in congenital hypothyroidism. Case<PERSON> presentation A 4-month-old boy presented with abdominal distention. Thyroid<PERSON> function tests ( TFTs<ORGANIZATION> ) revealed an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH<ORGANIZATION> ) level of 177 mU/L, normal free thyroxine ( fT4<ORGANIZATION> ) of 1.23 ng/dL, low free tri-iodothyronine ( fT3<ORGANIZATION> ) of 1.55 pg/mL and increased reverse T3 ( rT3<ORGANIZATION> ) of 1240 ng/dL. Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) revealed multiple IHHs<ORGANIZATION>. Based on his TFTs<ORGANIZATION>, ultrasonography and MRI<ORGANIZATION> evidence, he was diagnosed with consumptive hypothyroidism, and L-thyroxine replacement at 15 μg/kg/day was started. The L-thyroxine dose was increased gradually to 35 μ/kg/day until a stabilising euthyroid status was achieved. By the age of 8 months, the TSH<ORGANIZATION> concentration was decreased to normal levels ; the L-thyroxine dose was gradually reduced and finally discontinued at the age of 12 months. Repeat abdominal ultrasound and MRI<ORGANIZATION> revealed a reduction in the number and size of the haemangiomas. The TFTs<ORGANIZATION> were at normal reference levels. The patient remains in active follow-up. Conclusions Neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism is usually negative in cases of IHH<ORGANIZATION>, as seen in our case. A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose hypothyroidism in cases of IHH<ORGANIZATION>. The present case required very high doses of levothyroxine to achieve a euthyroid status. In cases of hypothyroidism in the first year of life with consumptive hypothyroidism caused by hepatic haemangioma, aggressive L-thyroxine replacement is required with no upper limit. The dose should be increased gradually until a stabilising euthyroid status is achieved.
