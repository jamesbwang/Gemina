 Existing anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL<ORGANIZATION> ) injury prevention programs have failed to reverse the high rate of ACL<ORGANIZATION> injuries in adolescent female athletes. This investigation attempts to overcome factors that limit efficacy with existing injury prevention programs through the use of a novel, objective, and real-time interactive visual feedback system designed to reduce the biomechanical risk factors associated with ACL<ORGANIZATION> injuries. Crossover study. Medical<PERSON> center laboratory. Twenty<PERSON> female participants ( age = 19.7 ± 1.34 y ; height = 1.74 ± 0.09 m ; weight = 72.16 ± 12.45 kg ). Participants<PERSON> performed sets of 10 bodyweight squats in each of eight training blocks ( i.e., four real-time and four control blocks ) and three testing blocks for a total of 110 squats. Feedback conditions were blocked and counterbalanced with half of participants randomly assigned to receive the real-time feedback block first and half receiving the control ( sham ) feedback first. Heat map analysis revealed that during interaction with the real-time feedback, squat performance measured in terms of key biomechanical parameters was improved compared to when participants squatted with the sham stimulus. This study demonstrates that the interactive feedback system guided participants to significantly improve movement biomechanics during performance of a body weight squat, which is a fundamental exercise for a longer-term ACL<ORGANIZATION> injury risk reduction intervention. A longer training and testing period is necessary to investigate the efficacy of this feedback approach to effect long-term adaptations in the biomechanical risk profile of athletes.
