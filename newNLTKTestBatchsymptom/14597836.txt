 Clinic<PERSON> blood pressure ( BP ) is recognized as the gold standard for the screening, diagnosis, and management of hypertension. However, optimal diagnosis and successful management of hypertension can not be achieved exclusively by a handful of conventionally acquired BP<ORGANIZATION> readings. It is critical to estimate the magnitude of BP<ORGANIZATION> variability by estimating and quantifying each individual patient 's specific BP variations. Short-term BP variability or exaggerated circadian BP variations that occur within a day are associated with increased cardiovascular events, mortality and target-organ damage. Popular concepts of BP<ORGANIZATION> variability, including `` white-coat hypertension '' and `` masked hypertension '', are well recognized in clinical practice. However, nocturnal hypertension, morning surge, and morning hypertension are also important phenotypes of short-term BP variability that warrant attention, especially in the primary-care setting. In this review, we try to theorize and explain these phenotypes to ensure they are better understood and recognized in day-to-day clinical practice.
