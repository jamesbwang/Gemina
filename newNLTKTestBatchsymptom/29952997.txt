 The aim of the study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of epidural analgesia and transverse abdominis plane ( TAP<ORGANIZATION> ) block. TAP block has gained popularity to provide postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery but its advantage over epidural analgesia is disputed. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews<ORGANIZATION> and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA<ORGANIZATION> ) statement guidelines. Only trials comparing TAP<ORGANIZATION> block with epidural analgesia were included. The primary outcome was pain score at rest ( analog scale, 0-10 ) on postoperative day 1 analyzed in subgroups according to the population ( children and adults ). Secondary outcomes included rate of hypotension, length of stay, and functional outcomes ( time to first bowel sound, time to first flatus ). Ten controlled trials, including 505 patients ( 195 children and 310 adults ), were identified. Pain scores at rest on postoperative day 1 were equivalent for TAP<ORGANIZATION> block and epidural analgesia groups in children ( mean difference: 0.3 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ]: -0.1 to 0.6 ; I = 0 % ; P<PERSON> = .15 ) and in adults ( mean difference: 0.5 ; 95 % CI: -0.1 to 1.0 ; I = 81 % ; P<PERSON> = .10 ). The quality of evidence for our primary outcome was moderate according to the GRADE<ORGANIZATION> system. The epidural analgesia group experienced a higher rate of hypotension ( relative risk: 0.13 ; 95 % CI: 0.04-0.38 ; I = 0 % ; P<PERSON> = .0002 ), while hospital length of stay was shorter in the TAP<ORGANIZATION> block group ( mean difference: -0.6 days ; 95 % CI: -0.9 to -0.3 days ; I = 0 % ; P<PERSON> < .0001 ), without impact on functional outcomes. There is moderate evidence that TAP<ORGANIZATION> block and epidural analgesia are equally effective in treating postoperative pain in both pediatric and adult patients, while TAP<ORGANIZATION> block is associated with fewer episodes of hypotension and reduced length of stay.
