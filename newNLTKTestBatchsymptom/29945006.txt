 To examine the changes of expression and activity of phosphodiesterase V ( PDEV<ORGANIZATION> ) in the basilar artery following cerebral vasospasm ( CVS<ORGANIZATION> ) after subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH<ORGANIZATION> ) in rabbits model. A rabbit model of CVS<ORGANIZATION> after SAH<ORGANIZATION> was constructed by twice blood injection into the cisterna magna. The subjects were divided into the following groups: blank control, tested control and SAH-treated group. Transcranial doppler ( TCD<ORGANIZATION> ) and selective vertebrobasilar digital subtraction angiography ( DSA<ORGANIZATION> ) were performed on day 5 to determine the changes of CVS<ORGANIZATION>. Changes of PDEV<ORGANIZATION> expression and activity were examined. Severity of CVS<ORGANIZATION> could be accurately determined by DSA<ORGANIZATION> and TCD<ORGANIZATION>. Narrowing of the basilar artery was observed at 24 h after second blood injection into the SAH-treated rabbits, along with delayed imaging and increased blood flow rate. These changes reached peak levels on day 3 post-surgery and were maintained up until day 7, after which they gradually returned to normal levels on day 11. PDEV<ORGANIZATION> expression was significantly increased in the basilar artery of rabbits in the SAH<ORGANIZATION> group. The concentration and activity of PDEV<ORGANIZATION> began to increase at 24 h post-surgery, peaked at day 3-day 7, and gradually decreased to normal levels on day 11. Increased basilar artery blood flow, narrowing of the basilar artery, and PDEV<ORGANIZATION> expression in the basilar artery could be detected using TCD<ORGANIZATION>, DSA<ORGANIZATION> and immunohistochemistry, respectively, suggesting that PDEV<ORGANIZATION> is associated with the development of CVS<ORGANIZATION> following SAH<ORGANIZATION> in rabbits.
