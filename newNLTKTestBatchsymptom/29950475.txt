 Persons with type 1 diabetes require intensive insulin therapy to achieve glycaemic control, but side effects, including hypoglycaemia and weight gain, may reduce treatment compliance. We hypothesise that add-on treatment of the short-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, to insulin therapy in persons with type 1 diabetes will reduce insulin requirements, glycaemic excursions and body weight and improve glycaemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. The present article describes a protocol developed to test this hypothesis. One-hundred adult persons with type 1 diabetes for more than 1 year, insufficient glycaemic control ( glycated haemoglobin A1c<ORGANIZATION> ( HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> ) between 58 and 86 mmol/mol ) and body mass index > 22.0 kg/m The study is approved by the Danish Medicines Agency<ORGANIZATION>, the Regional Scientific Ethics Committee<ORGANIZATION> of the Capital Region<ORGANIZATION> of Denmark<GPE> and the Data Protection Agency<ORGANIZATION>. The study will be carried out under the surveillance and guidance of the good clinical practice ( GCP<ORGANIZATION> ) unit at Copenhagen University Hospital Bispebjerg<ORGANIZATION> in accordance with the ICH-GCP guidelines and the Helsinki Declaration<ORGANIZATION>. Positive<PERSON>, negative as well as inconclusive results will be sought disseminated at scientific meetings and in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. NCT03017352.
