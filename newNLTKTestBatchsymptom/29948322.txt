 Cement<GPE> augmentation of pedicle screws is known to increase their mechanical strength. Aim<PERSON> was to evaluate the impact of cement augmentation on pedicle screw fatigue strength in dependence of the bone mineral density ( BMD<ORGANIZATION> ). Twenty-one human L2 vertebral bodies from donors between 19 and 96 years of age were used for in vitro experiments. BMD<ORGANIZATION> was measured using quantitative computed tomography ( QCT<ORGANIZATION> ). Two pedicle screws were inserted in each specimen and unilaterally augmented with bone cement. Fatigue<PERSON> testing was performed using a cranio-caudal sinusoidal, cyclic load ( 0.5 Hz ) with increasing compression force ( 100 N + 0.1 N/cycles ). Results were evaluated for the BMD<ORGANIZATION> groups: normal: BMD<ORGANIZATION> > 120 mg/cm There was a significant correlation between fatigue force and BMD<ORGANIZATION> for the non-augmented and augmented screws ( non-augmented R The benefit of pedicle screw cement augmentation significantly depends on the bone mineral density and has the greatest extent of increased fatigue strength in osteoporotic vertebrae. Preoperative measurement of the BMD<ORGANIZATION> is strongly recommended to predict the benefit of augmentation and reinforce the decision for cement augmentation.
