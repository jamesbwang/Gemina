 To assess the remineralization capacity of carious, non-carious, and combined white spot lesions ( WSLs<ORGANIZATION> ) using the ICDAS<ORGANIZATION> and SS-OCT. This clinical trial was based on a quasi-experimental design. Forty-two healthy subjects ( median age 26.6 years ), who visited university hospital and had at least one WSL with an ICDAS<ORGANIZATION> score of 2 or 1, were recruited. The subjects chewed a non-blind sugar-free gum containing bioavailable calcium and fluoride for 3 months. The remineralization capacities of carious and non-carious 121 WSLs were assessed using ICDAS<ORGANIZATION> by two calibrated non-blind examiners and optical boundary depth ( BD ) by SS-OCT at a monthly recall. The outcome variables, transitions of ICDAS<ORGANIZATION> score, mean BD, and mean BD recovery rate ( RR<ORGANIZATION> % ), were statistically analyzed using the chi-square test, two way-repeated measures ANOVA<ORGANIZATION>, and Wilcoxon<PERSON> rank sum test, respectively ( alpha = 0.05 ). Based on the visual inspection, OCT<ORGANIZATION> images at the baseline, 72 WSLs were purely carious, 20 were non-carious ( developmental ) lesions, while 29 were combined ( carious-developmental ). The responses of WSLs<ORGANIZATION> over time showed to be highly variable. There was a significant difference in transitions of ICDAS<ORGANIZATION> scores after 3 months between carious and non-carious WSLs<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.05 ) and non-carious and combined WSLs<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.05 ). Carious<PERSON> and combined WSLs<ORGANIZATION> underwent significant changes in the mean BD between baseline ( 161.8 ± 56.8 μm ) and 2 months ( 130.7 ± 57.4 μm ) or 3 months ( 119.1 ± 57.5 μm ) ( p < 0.05 ), while there was no significant difference between baseline ( 132.2 ± 26.2 μm ) and 2 months ( 122.8 ± 24.1 μm ) or 3 months ( 119.8 ± 22.6 μm ) in non-carious WSLs<ORGANIZATION> ( p > 0.05 ). There was a significant difference in mean RR % after 2 and 3 months between carious and non-carious WSLs<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.05 ). The remineralization capacity of WSL<ORGANIZATION> was variable among the cases and subjects, and depended on the WSLs<ORGANIZATION> history, etiology ( carious, non-carious, or combined lesion ) and structure ( histological pattern ). Carious WSLs<PERSON> showed the highest remineralization potential.
