 Genomic<GPE> imprinting is a conspicuous feature of the endosperm, a triploid tissue nurturing the embryo and synchronizing angiosperm seed development. An unknown subset of imprinted genes ( IGs<ORGANIZATION> ) is critical for successful seed development and should have highly conserved functions. Recent genome-wide studies have found limited conservation of IGs<ORGANIZATION> among distantly related species, but there is a paucity of data from closely related lineages. Moreover, most studies focused on model plants with nuclear endosperm development, and comparisons with properties of IGs<ORGANIZATION> in cellular-type endosperm development are lacking. Using laser-assisted microdissection, we characterized parent-specific expression in the cellular endosperm of three wild tomato lineages ( Solanum<ORGANIZATION> section Lycopersicon ). We identified 1,025 candidate IGs<ORGANIZATION> and 167 with putative homologs previously identified as imprinted in distantly related taxa with nuclear-type endosperm. Forty-two maternally expressed genes ( MEGs<ORGANIZATION> ) and 17 paternally expressed genes ( PEGs<ORGANIZATION> ) exhibited conserved imprinting status across all three lineages, but differences in power to assess imprinted expression imply that the actual degree of conservation might be higher than that directly estimated ( 20.7 % for PEGs<ORGANIZATION> and 10.4 % for MEGs<ORGANIZATION> ). Regardless, the level of shared imprinting status was higher for PEGs<ORGANIZATION> than for MEGs<ORGANIZATION>, indicating dissimilar evolutionary trajectories. Expression-level data suggest distinct epigenetic modulation of MEGs<ORGANIZATION> and PEGs<ORGANIZATION>, and gene ontology analyses revealed MEGs<ORGANIZATION> and PEGs<ORGANIZATION> to be enriched for different functions. Importantly, our data provide evidence that MEGs<ORGANIZATION> and PEGs<ORGANIZATION> interact in modulating both gene expression and the endosperm cell cycle, and uncovered conserved cellular functions of IGs<ORGANIZATION> uniting taxa with cellular- and nuclear-type endosperm.
