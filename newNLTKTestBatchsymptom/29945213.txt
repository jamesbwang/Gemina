 Potassium<GPE> ( K ) has an important impact on physiological and biochemical processes in plants. Soybean<PERSON>, Glycine<PERSON> max ( L. ) Merrill<PERSON>, requires high K availability for optimal yield. However, changes in nutrient availability in plants may also affect herbivore population size and/or development. Soybean<PERSON> looper, Chrysodeixis<PERSON> includens ( Walker ) ( Lepidoptera: Noctuidae ), is one of the most destructive pests of soybean in the southern United States<GPE>. In this study, we evaluated the effects of different K fertilization rates on soybean looper development, soybean seed weight, and soybean seed nutritional quality. Soybean plants were supplied with six different rates of K fertilizer ( 0, 33.6, 67.3, 100.9, 134.5, and 168.1 kg/ha as K2O<GPE> ). Soybean leaves were sampled at R1<ORGANIZATION>, R3<GPE>, R5<GPE>, and R6 stages and fed to soybean looper in laboratory bioassays. Soybean<PERSON> looper mortality, fecundity, and fertility were not significantly affected by feeding on leaf tissues of soybean treated with different potassium fertilizer rates. However, soybean looper consumed more leaf tissue and spent less time completing larval development when fed on foliage from treatments of 134.5 and 168.1 kg/ha. Pupal<PERSON> weight significantly increased at 134.5 and 168.1 kg/ha. There was no significant difference in percentage of protein, oil, and fiber in soybean seeds among six K fertilizer rates. Percentage of K in soybean seeds and 100 seed weight were significantly enhanced at 168.1 kg/ha. Nitrogen ( N ) content of foliage was not affected by applying K fertilizer at different rates. Our results indicate that higher K fertilizer rates can enhance soybean seed weight but also facilitate soybean looper development.
