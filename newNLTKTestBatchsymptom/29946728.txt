 Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC<ORGANIZATION> ) have limited effective and tolerable treatment options. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral fruquintinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) inhibitor, as third-line or later therapy in patients with metastatic CRC<ORGANIZATION>. FRESCO<GPE> ( Fruquintinib Efficacy<ORGANIZATION> and Safety<GPE> in 3+ Line Colorectal Cancer Patients<PERSON> ) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter ( 28 hospitals in China<GPE> ), phase 3 clinical trial. From December 2014 to May 2016, screening took place among 519 patients aged 18 to 75 years who had metastatic CRC that progressed after at least 2 lines of chemotherapy but had not received VEGFR<ORGANIZATION> inhibitor therapy ; 416 met the eligibility criteria and were stratified by prior anti-VEGF therapy and K-ras status. The final date of follow-up was January 17, 2017. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either fruquintinib, 5 mg ( n = 278 ) or placebo ( n = 138 ) orally, once daily for 21 days, followed by 7 days off in 28-day cycles, until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or study withdrawal. The primary end point was overall survival. Key<PERSON> secondary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival ( time from randomization to disease progression or death ), objective response rate ( confirmed complete or partial response ), and disease control rate ( complete or partial response, or stable disease recorded â‰¥8 weeks postrandomization ). Duration of response was also assessed. Safety<PERSON> outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events. Of the 416 randomized patients ( mean age, 54.6 years ; 161 [ 38.7 % ] women ), 404 ( 97.1 % ) completed the trial. Median<GPE> overall survival was significantly prolonged with fruquintinib compared with placebo ( 9.3 months [ 95 % CI, 8.2-10.5 ] vs 6.6 months [ 95 % CI, 5.9-8.1 ] ) ; hazard ratio ( HR ) for death, 0.65 ( 95 % CI, 0.51-0.83 ; P<PERSON> < .001 ). Median<GPE> progression-free survival was also significantly increased with fruquintinib ( 3.7 months [ 95 % CI, 3.7-4.6 ] vs 1.8 months [ 95 % CI, 1.8-1.8 ] months ) ; HR for progression or death, 0.26 ( 95 % CI, 0.21 to 0.34 ; P<PERSON> < .001 ). Grades 3 and 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 61.2 % ( 170 ) of patients who received fruquintinib and 19.7 % ( 27 ) who received placebo. Serious<PERSON> adverse events were reported by 15.5 % ( 43 ) of patients in the fruquintinib group and 5.8 % ( 8 ) in the placebo group, with 14.4 % ( 40 ) of fruquintinib-treated and 5.1 % ( 7 ) of placebo-treated patients requiring hospitalization. Among Chinese<GPE> patients with metastatic CRC who had tumor progression following at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, oral fruquintinib compared with placebo resulted in a statistically significant increase in overall survival. Further<PERSON> research is needed to assess efficacy outside of China<GPE>. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02314819.
