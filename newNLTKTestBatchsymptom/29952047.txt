 Women with a family history of breast cancer ( BC ) often overestimate their BC risk. Heightened psychological distress may interfere with risk comprehension and screening adherence. The primary purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a 12-week manual-based supportive-expressive ( SE ) group intervention for this population. Using a randomized control trial design, this study compared two interventions: a standard risk-counselling arm ( RC ) compared to that plus SE<ORGANIZATION> group intervention. The primary study outcome was breast cancer anxiety. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial functioning, risk comprehension, BC<ORGANIZATION> knowledge and screening behaviours. 161 women with a family history of BC were randomized into SE ( N=108 ) or RC ( N=53 ). Participants in both study arms significantly improved on measures of BC<ORGANIZATION> anxiety, psychosocial functioning, risk comprehension and BC<ORGANIZATION> knowledge, with no statistical difference between study arms. Benefits were sustained at one year. BC screening rates were high in both arms at baseline and follow-up. SE group therapy as an added intervention to the risk counselling was well-received, however, did not demonstrate superiority to RC alone. Future studies on treatment matching are needed to further our understanding of interventions that can support women with a family history of BC to work through residual issues, including loss and grief.
