 Triacylglycerol<GPE> ( TAG<ORGANIZATION> ) from photosynthetic microalgae is a sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Physiological stress triggers microalgal TAG<ORGANIZATION> accumulation. However excessive physiological stress will impair the photosynthesis system seriously thus decreasing TAG<ORGANIZATION> productivity because of the low biomass production. Hence<PERSON>, it is critical to quantitatively and timely monitor the degree of the stress while the microalgal cells growing so that the optimal TAG<ORGANIZATION> productivity can be obtained. The lack of an on-line monitored indicator has limited our ability to gain knowledge of cellular `` health status '' information regarding high TAG<ORGANIZATION> productivity. Therefore, to monitor the degree of nitrogen stress of the cells, we investigated the correlation between the photosynthetic system II ( PS<ORGANIZATION> II ) quantum yield and the degree of stress based on the high relevancy between photosynthetic reduction and nitrogen stress-induced TAG<ORGANIZATION> accumulation in microalgal cells. Δ The results indicate that the semi-continuous cultivation process with a controlled degree of stress by monitoring the Δ
