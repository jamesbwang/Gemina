 A sudden increase in the number of newborn infants with microcephaly in Brazil<GPE> in 2015 brought Zika<PERSON> virus ( ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> ), a less-known infection, to public attention. The rapid increase in the number of cases across the Americas<ORGANIZATION> and the devastating complications of infection with ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> highlighted the gravity of the situation. Within a relatively short period of time, our knowledge of this infection has significantly increased. This includes the realisation that ZIKV<ORGANIZATION> can be sexually transmitted. The aim of the present article is to provide a concise summary on this novel sexually transmitted infection linked to human birth defects and Guillain-Barre Syndrome.
