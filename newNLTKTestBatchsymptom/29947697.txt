 Exposure<GPE> to particulate matter ( PM ) is associated with hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases among children. An ecological time series study was carried out to identify the role of coarse fractions of particulate matter ( PM10-2.5 ) in hospitalizations among children up to 10 years of age, in Piracicaba<GPE> ( SP ) in the year 2015. A generalized additive model of Poisson<GPE> regression was used to estimate the risk of hospitalization due to acute laryngitis and tracheitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis and asthma. Lags of 0 to 7 days were considered, and the model was adjusted for the temperature and relative humidity of the air and controlled for short and long-term exposure. Proportional attributable ratios, population-attributable fractions and hospital costs were calculated with increasing concentrations of these pollutants. 638 hospitalizations were evaluated during this period, with a mean of 1.75 cases per day ( standard deviation, SD<ORGANIZATION> = 1.86 ). The daily averages were 22.45 µg/m3 ( SD<ORGANIZATION> = 13.25 ) for the coarse fraction ( PM10-2.5 ) and 13.32 µg/m3 ( SD<ORGANIZATION> = 6.38 ) for the fine fraction. Significant risks of PM10-2.5 exposure were only observed at lag 0, with relative risk ( RR ) = 1.012, and at lag 6, with RR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.011. An increase of 5 µg/m3 in the coarse fraction concentration implied an increase in the relative risk of hospitalizations of up to 4.8 %, with an excess of 72 hospitalizations and excess expenditure of US<GPE> $ 17,000 per year. This study showed the impact of coarse-fraction exposure on hospital admissions among children due to respiratory diseases.
