 Although the eighth-edition American Joint Committee<ORGANIZATION> on Cancer<GPE> ( AJCC<ORGANIZATION> ) gastric cancer staging system created ypTNM staging for patients who underwent preoperative therapy, the ideal ypTNM<ORGANIZATION> grouping is unknown. We sought to investigate risk factors for OS in ypT0-3N0M0 gastric cancer. From an institutional database of The University<ORGANIZATION> of Texas<GPE> MD Anderson Cancer Center<PERSON> and the National Cancer Database<ORGANIZATION> ( NCDB<ORGANIZATION> ), we identified patients with ypT0-3N0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent R0 gastrectomy after chemotherapy or chemoradiation during 1995-2015 ( MD Anderson<ORGANIZATION> ) or 2006-2014 ( NCDB<ORGANIZATION> ). The study included 175 MD Anderson<PERSON> and 3200 NCDB<ORGANIZATION> patients. By multivariable analysis, ypT<ORGANIZATION> category was not associated with OS<ORGANIZATION> ( hazard ratio [ HR ] for ypT3<ORGANIZATION> vs ypT1: MD Anderson<PERSON>, 0.83 [ 95 % CI, 0.36-1.92 ], P<PERSON> = 0.669 ; NCDB<ORGANIZATION>, 0.96 [ 95 % CI, 0.85-1.08 ], P<PERSON> = 0.472 ). cN-positive disease was not associated with OS<ORGANIZATION> in the MD Anderson<ORGANIZATION> cohort ( HR<ORGANIZATION>, 0.96 [ 95 % CI, 0.55-1.67 ] ; P<PERSON> = 0.873 ) but was weakly associated with shorter OS in the NCDB<ORGANIZATION> cohort ( HR<ORGANIZATION>, 1.11 [ 95 % CI, 1.01-1.21 ] ; P<PERSON> = 0.031 ). The ypT<ORGANIZATION> category does not impact OS in ypT0-3N0M0 gastric cancer. The impact of cN<ORGANIZATION> status on OS<ORGANIZATION> appeared limited. These findings should be considered in future systems of post-neoadjuvant pathologic staging.
