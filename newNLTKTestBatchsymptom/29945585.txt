 Research<GPE> suggests that vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF<ORGANIZATION> ) levels in the synovial fluid of knee osteoarthritis ( KOA<ORGANIZATION> ) patients are positively correlated with KOA<ORGANIZATION> severity. The relationship between synovial VEGF<ORGANIZATION> levels and pain in human KOA<ORGANIZATION> patients is not fully understood, and the role of VEGF<ORGANIZATION> in the pain pathway remains unclear. We harvested synovial membrane ( SM ) from 102 patients with radiographic evidence of KOA<ORGANIZATION> ( unilateral Kellgren/Lawrence [ K/L ] grade 2-4 ) during total knee arthroplasty. Patients<PERSON> scored their pain on a 0 to 10 cm visual analog scale ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> ). VEGF<ORGANIZATION> levels in the SM<ORGANIZATION> of KOA<ORGANIZATION> patients with strong/severe ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 6 ) and mild/moderate pain ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> < 6 ) were compared. Correlations between VAS<ORGANIZATION> and VEGF<ORGANIZATION> mRNA expression were investigated. To investigate a possible mechanism for VEGF-induced pain, the distribution of VEGF<ORGANIZATION> and the neuropeptide apelin was determined by immunohistochemical analyses. To investigate the role of VEGF<ORGANIZATION> in regulating apelin expression, SM<ORGANIZATION> cells were exposed to VEGF<ORGANIZATION>. VEGF<ORGANIZATION> expression in the VAS<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 6 group was significantly greater than expression in the VAS<ORGANIZATION> < 6 group. Expression levels of VEGF<ORGANIZATION> were also positively correlated with VAS<ORGANIZATION>. VEGF-positive cells were identified in the lining of the SM<ORGANIZATION>. Expression of apelin mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein were significantly elevated in SM cells treated with exogenous VEGF<ORGANIZATION> compared to those treated with vehicle. Synovial VEGF<PERSON> may be involved in pain pathways in KOA<ORGANIZATION> and its action may be mediated by apelin.
