 Cross-sectional studies have shown that spinal cord volume ( SCV<ORGANIZATION> ) loss is related to disease severity in multiple sclerosis ( MS ). However, long-term data are lacking. Our aim was to evaluate SCV<ORGANIZATION> loss as a biomarker of disease progression in comparison to other MRI<ORGANIZATION> measurements in a large cohort of patients with relapse-onset MS with 6-year follow-up. The upper cervical SCV<ORGANIZATION>, the total brain volume, and the brain T2 lesion volume were measured annually in 231 patients with MS ( 180 relapsing-remitting [ RRMS<ORGANIZATION> ] and 51 secondary progressive [ SPMS<ORGANIZATION> ] ) over 6 years on 3-dimensional, T1-weighted, magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo images. Expanded Disability Status Scale<PERSON> ( EDSS<ORGANIZATION> ) score and relapses were recorded at every follow-up. Patients with SPMS<ORGANIZATION> had lower baseline SCV<ORGANIZATION> ( SCV<ORGANIZATION> loss over time relates to the number of clinical relapses in RRMS<GPE>, but overall does not differ between RRMS<ORGANIZATION> and SPMS<ORGANIZATION>. SCV<ORGANIZATION> proved to be a strong predictor of physical disability and disease progression, indicating that SCV<ORGANIZATION> may be a suitable marker for monitoring disease activity and severity.
