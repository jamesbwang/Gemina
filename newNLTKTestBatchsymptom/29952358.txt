 The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the prognostic impact of renal dysfunction ( RD ) at admission in patients with preserved, moderately impaired and severely impaired left ventricular systolic function following ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI<ORGANIZATION> ). We included 2436 patients with STEMI<PERSON> treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pPCI<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock and those on hemodyalisis were excluded. According to the left ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ), patients were divided in three groups: preserved left ventricular systolic function - EF<ORGANIZATION> > 50 %, moderately impaired - EF=40 % -50 % and severely impaired left ventricular systolic function-EF < 40 %. RD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR<ORGANIZATION> ) < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 at admission. The follow-up period was 6 years. Preserved, moderately impaired and severely impaired systolic function were found in 741 ( 30.5 % ), 1367 ( 56.1 % ) and 328 ( 13.4 % ) patients, respectively. RD was present in 105 ( 14.2 % ) patients with preserved systolic function, 247 ( 18.1 % ) patients with moderately impaired, and 120 ( 36.5 % ) patients with severely impaired systolic function.Regardless of the presence of RD<ORGANIZATION>, 6-year mortality rates in patients with preserved, moderately impaired, and severely impaired systolic function were 2.7 %, 5.2 % and 31.1 % respectively. Within each LVEF<ORGANIZATION> group, patients with RD<ORGANIZATION> had a worse outcome, both in the short- and long-term. In the Mulivariate Cox Analysis<ORGANIZATION>, RD<ORGANIZATION> remained an independent predictor of 6-year mortality in patients with moderately ( HR 2.52, 95 % CI 1.54-3.78 ) and severely impaired systolic function ( HR 2.84, 95 % CI 1.68-5.34 ), but not in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function ( HR 0.59, 95 % CI 0.14-1.41 ). Although patients with RD<ORGANIZATION> had higher 6-year mortallity following STEMI<ORGANIZATION> regardless of LVEF<ORGANIZATION>, RD<ORGANIZATION> at admission remained a strong independent predictor for 6-year mortality only in patients with moderately and severely impaired left ventricular systolic function.
