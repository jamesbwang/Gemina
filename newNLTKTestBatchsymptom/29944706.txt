 Daily<GPE> self-weighing ( DSW<ORGANIZATION> ) and daily activity tracking ( DAT<ORGANIZATION> ) are useful strategies for preventing weight gain among African American<ORGANIZATION> breast cancer survivors. However, self-monitoring behaviors vary over time, increasing risk of weight gain. This study explored the association of nonadherence to DSW<ORGANIZATION> and DAT<ORGANIZATION> with corresponding weight fluctuations among African American<ORGANIZATION> breast cancer survivors. Using data from a 6-month randomized controlled trial, we conducted a secondary data analysis among women randomized into a DSW<ORGANIZATION> group ( n = 13 ) and a DSW+DAT group ( n = 11 ). DSW<ORGANIZATION> and DAT<ORGANIZATION> were captured from wireless scale and activity tracker data. Nonadherence to DSW<ORGANIZATION> was defined as one or more days without a weight measurement, and nonadherence to DAT<ORGANIZATION> was defined as one or more days without activity tracking. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine weight fluctuations in relation to nonadherence to DSW<ORGANIZATION> and DAT<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> analysis occurred from September 2016-April 2017. Over the 6-month study period, women provided 119.2 ± 46.0 weight measurements and 121.9 ± 53.2 days of physical activity tracking. Nonadherence to DSW<ORGANIZATION> was associated with weight fluctuations. For every 1-day increase in nonadherence to DSW<ORGANIZATION>, weight increased by 0.031 kg ( 95 % CI: 0.012, 0.050 ; p < 0.01 ). Additionally, during periods of DSW<ORGANIZATION> and DAT<ORGANIZATION> weight decreased by 0.028 kg ( 95 % CI: -0.042, -0.014<GPE> ; p < 0.001 ) and 0.017 kg ( 95 % CI: -0.030 ; -0.004 ) respectively. Our findings suggest that nonadherence to DSW<ORGANIZATION> was associated with weight gain among breast cancer survivors. Weight<PERSON> loss was enhanced during periods of DSW<ORGANIZATION> and DAT<ORGANIZATION>.
