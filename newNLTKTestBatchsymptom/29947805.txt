 Despite increased risk for negative outcomes, cognitive impairment ( CI ) is greatly under-detected during hospitalization. While automated EHR-based phenotypes have potential to improve recognition of CI<ORGANIZATION>, they are hindered by widespread under-diagnosis of underlying etiologies such as dementia-limiting the utility of more precise structured data elements. This study examined unstructured data on symptoms of CI in the acute-care EHRs<ORGANIZATION> of hip and stroke fracture patients with dementia from two hospitals. Clinician<PERSON> reviewers identified and classified unstructured EHR<ORGANIZATION> data using standardized criteria. Relevant narrative text was descriptively characterized and evaluated for key terminology. Most patient EHRs<ORGANIZATION> ( 90 % ) had narrative text reflecting cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction common in CI that were reliably classified ( Îº 0.82 ). The majority of statements reflected vague descriptions of cognitive/behavioral dysfunction as opposed to diagnostic terminology. Findings from this preliminary derivation study suggest that clinicians use specific terminology in unstructured EHR<ORGANIZATION> fields to describe common symptoms of CI<ORGANIZATION>. This terminology can inform the design of EHR-based phenotypes for CI<ORGANIZATION> and merits further investigation in more diverse, robustly characterized samples.
