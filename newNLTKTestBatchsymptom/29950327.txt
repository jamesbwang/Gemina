 We aimed to assess risk factors for the development of severe infection in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitis ( AAV<ORGANIZATION> ) receiving rituximab. 192 patients with AAV<ORGANIZATION> were identified. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for severe infection following rituximab. Severe infections were classified as grade â‰¥3 as proposed by the Common Terminology Criteria<ORGANIZATION> for Adverse Events<PERSON> V.4.0. 95 severe infections were recorded in 49 ( 25.52 % ) patients, corresponding to an event rate of 26.06 per 100 person-years. The prophylactic use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a lower frequency of severe infections ( HR 0.30, 95 % CI 0.13 to 0.69 ), while older age ( HR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.05 ), endobronchial involvement ( HR 2.21, 95 % CI 1.14 to 4.26 ), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( HR 6.30, 95 % CI 1.08 to 36.75 ) and previous alemtuzumab use ( HR 3.97, 95 % CI 1.50 to 10.54 ) increased the risk. When analysis was restricted to respiratory tract infections ( 66.3 % of all infections ), endobronchial involvement ( HR 4.27, 95 % CI 1.81 to 10.06 ), severe bronchiectasis ( HR 6.14, 95 % CI 1.18 to 31.91 ), higher neutrophil count ( HR 1.19, 95 % CI 1.06 to 1.33 ) and major relapse ( HR 3.07, 95 % CI 1.30 to 7.23 ) as indication for rituximab use conferred a higher risk, while refractory disease ( HR 0.25, 95 % CI 0.07 to 0.90 ) as indication had a lower frequency of severe infections. We found severe infections in one quarter of patients with AAV<ORGANIZATION> receiving rituximab. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis reduced the risk, while especially bronchiectasis and endobronchial involvement are risk factors for severe respiratory infections.
