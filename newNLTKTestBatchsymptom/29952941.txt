 Although pseudoaneurysm ( PA ) formation following primary and revision total hip arthroplasty ( THA<ORGANIZATION> ) is rare, PA<ORGANIZATION> rupture may lead to severe complications that can result in a threat to life and limb. A 65-year-old man presented with acute hemorrhagic discharge for one day from the chronic hip sinus secondary to revision THA that had been performed 6 years ago, for which he had received multiple courses of debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention procedures owing to periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI<ORGANIZATION> ). Radiographs<PERSON> showed septic loosening of both the femoral and acetabular components, with medial migration of the component beyond Kohler<PERSON> 's line. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis of the patient demonstrated a large PA of the right external iliac artery ( EIA<ORGANIZATION> ), measuring 6.1 cm Ã— 7.7 cm in diameter and 9.1 cm in length. A ball-shaped antibiotic-loaded cement spacer ( ALCS<ORGANIZATION> ) was used to tamponade a bleeding PA, treat the coexisting PJI<ORGANIZATION>, and thus facilitate endovascular stent-graft repair ( ESGR<ORGANIZATION> ) later on. The ESGR<ORGANIZATION> resulted in complete exclusion of the PA<ORGANIZATION> and successfully controlled the bleeding. The patient underwent a successful revision THA 6 months after stent insertion. Neither stent-graft infection nor recurrent PJI were detected at 18 months. Given the potential of a PA for causing significant morbidity and mortality, the surgeon should have an elevated index of suspicion in the presence of intrapelvic migration of the acetabular component. While facing a PA rupture with/without hemorrhagic shock in patients with coexisting hip PJI<ORGANIZATION>, ALCS<ORGANIZATION> ball implantation and subsequent ESGR<ORGANIZATION> might be an effective method to save the patient 's life and limb.
