 Febrile seizures ( FS ) are frequent convulsive disorders, occurring in infants and young children. The present study aims to assess and compare the serum levels of oxidative stress markers and some essential trace minerals in FS with normal or abnormal EEG<ORGANIZATION> and evaluate the effect of antioxidant therapy on the clinical outcome. This study has been carried out on 80 children with FS<ORGANIZATION> ( 40 with simple FS and 40 with complex FS ) and 40 febrile children without seizures. Clinical<PERSON> and EEG<ORGANIZATION> findings were recorded for the included patients. Biochemical assays of serum nitric oxide ( NO<ORGANIZATION> ), malondialdehyde ( MDA<ORGANIZATION> ), superoxide dismutase ( SOD<ORGANIZATION> ), copper ( Cu ), zinc ( Zn ) and selenium ( Se ), using colorimetric methods, were measured in the studied groups. The overall results showed an increased values of NO<ORGANIZATION>, MDA<ORGANIZATION> and Cu with decreased values of SOD<ORGANIZATION>, Zn<PERSON> and Se in patients with FS<ORGANIZATION> ( simple and complex ) in comparison with febrile children without seizures ( p < 0.05 for all ). Additionally, NO<ORGANIZATION> and MDA<ORGANIZATION> was increased in complex FS patients with EEG<ORGANIZATION> abnormalities in comparison with complex FS with normal EEG<ORGANIZATION> findings ( p < 0.05 ) ; NO<ORGANIZATION> and MDA<ORGANIZATION> were also significantly decreased after valproate therapy in complex FS patients ( p < 0.05 for all ). In conclusions, oxidative stress, decreased Zn and Se with increased Cu may play a role in FS. Valproate<ORGANIZATION> improves the oxidative stress status in complex FS.
