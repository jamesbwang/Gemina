 Thyroid<GPE> hormones are key regulators of avian metabolism and may play a significant role in development at hatching. To better understand the role of thyroid hormones in avian development, we examined autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure while manipulating thyroid hormone levels in the late stage embryonic Pekin duck ( Anas<ORGANIZATION> platyrhynchos domestica ). Thyroid<PERSON> hormone levels were manipulated on day 24 of a 28-day incubation period with the thyroperoxidase inhibitor methimazole ( MMI<ORGANIZATION> ), triiodothyronine ( T
