 Breweries release significant amounts of wastewater loaded with various organic and mineral materials. Prior studies of membrane bioreactor ( MBR<ORGANIZATION> ) wastewater treatment have been conducted with very little interest granted to the conditions of biomass acclimation. This study displays biomass behavior during brewery wastewater treatment by an aerobic MBR<ORGANIZATION>. In addition, nanofiltration and electrodialysis have been studied as potential post-treatment to decrease mineral concentrations and permit further water reuse for agriculture. An anoxic/aerobic laboratory MBR<ORGANIZATION>, associated with a flat sulfonated polyether membrane was used for synthetic brewery wastewater treatment. Biomass<PERSON> acclimation was performed using a feeding substrate. Organic concentrations in the MBR<ORGANIZATION> influent varied from 700 mg COD/L to 10,600 mg COD/L ( COD<ORGANIZATION>: chemical oxygen demand ) for 110 days. The results indicate a good acclimation to effluent with high salts and organic matter loads. Steady<PERSON> evolution of biomass concentration and activities was achieved after 90 days of operation. A reduction of COD<ORGANIZATION> of around 95 % was obtained with MBR<ORGANIZATION> and up to 99 % with nanofiltration post-treatment for the reconstructed brewery effluent with an organic loading rate of 7 g COD/LÂ·d and a solid and hydraulic retention time of 30 days and 36 hours. A good reduction of the salt content was also recorded primarily with the nanofiltration and electrodialysis processes.
