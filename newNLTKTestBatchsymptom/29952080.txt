 Medial<GPE> temporal lobe epilepsy ( mTLE<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most common refractory focal epilepsy in adults. Around 30 % -40 % of patients have prominent memory impairment and experience significant postoperative memory and language decline after surgical treatment. BDNF Val66Met<ORGANIZATION> polymorphism has also been associated with cognition and variability in structural and functional hippocampal indices in healthy controls and some patient groups. We examined whether BDNF Val66Met<ORGANIZATION> variation was associated with cognitive impairment in mTLE<ORGANIZATION>. In this study, we investigated the association of Val66Met<GPE> polymorphism with cognitive performance ( n = 276 ), postoperative cognitive change ( n = 126 ) and fMRI<ORGANIZATION> activation patterns during memory encoding and language paradigms in 2 groups of patients with mTLE<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 37 and 34 ). mTLE patients carrying the Met<ORGANIZATION> allele performed more poorly on memory tasks and showed reduced medial temporal lobe activation and reduced task-related deactivations within the default mode networks in both the fMRI<ORGANIZATION> memory and language tasks than Val/Val patients. Although cognitive impairment in epilepsy is the result of a complex interaction of factors, our results suggest a role of genetic factors on cognitive impairment in mTLE<ORGANIZATION>.
