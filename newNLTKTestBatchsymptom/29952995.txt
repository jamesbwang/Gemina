 Smooth<GPE> emergence or cough prevention is a clinically important concern in patients undergoing laryngomicroscopic surgery ( LMS<ORGANIZATION> ). The purpose of this study was to estimate the effective concentration of remifentanil in 95 % of patients ( EC95<ORGANIZATION> ) for the prevention of emergence cough after LMS<ORGANIZATION> under propofol anesthesia using the biased coin design ( BCD<ORGANIZATION> ) up-down method.A total of 40 adult patients scheduled to undergo elective LMS were enrolled. Anesthesia<GPE> induction and maintenance were performed with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. Effective effect-site concentration ( Ce ) of remifentanil in 95 % of patients for preventing emergence cough was estimated using a BCD<ORGANIZATION> method ( starting from 1 ng/mL with a step size of 0.4 ng/mL ). Hemodynamic<PERSON> and recovery profiles were observed after anesthesia.According to the study protocol, 20 patients were allocated to receive remifentanil Ce of 3.0 ng/mL, and 20 patients were assigned to receive lower concentrations of remifentanil, from 1.0 to 2.6 ng/mL. Based on isotonic regression with a bootstrapping method, EC95<ORGANIZATION> ( 95 % CI ) of remifentanil Ce for the prevention of emergence cough from LMS<ORGANIZATION> was found to be 2.92 ng/mL ( 2.72-2.97 ng/mL ). Compared with patients receiving lower concentrations of remifentanil, the incidence of hypoventilation before extubation and extubation time were significantly higher in those receiving remifentanil Ce of 3.0 ng/mL. However, hypoventilation incidence after extubation and staying time in the recovery room were comparable between the 2 groups.Using a BCD<ORGANIZATION> method, the EC95<ORGANIZATION> of remifentanil Ce for the prevention of emergence cough was estimated to be 2.92 ng/mL ( 95 % CI: 2.72-2.97 ng/mL ) after LMS<ORGANIZATION> under propofol anesthesia.
