 Although it has been widely accepted that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 ( PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> ) is a cancer-promoting gene in various cancers, the mechanism of PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ) requires more exploration. This study aimed to investigate the role of PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> in HCC<ORGANIZATION> growth and metastasis. We compared PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> expression and clinicopathological characteristics using paired HCC<ORGANIZATION> and adjacent noncancerous liver tissues from 210 patients and immunohistochemistry analyses. Cell<PERSON> proliferation, colony formation and migration were determined in HCC<ORGANIZATION> cell lines with PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> overexpression or downregulation through MTT<ORGANIZATION>, crystal violet and Boyden<GPE> chamber assays. Tumour growth was monitored in a xenograft model, and intrahepatic metastasis models were established. PRMT1 expression was greatly increased in clinical HCC<ORGANIZATION> samples and strongly associated with poor prognosis and recurrence ; PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> expression was also positively correlated with microvascular invasion ( P<PERSON> = 0.024 ), tumour differentiation ( P<PERSON> = 0.014 ), tumour size ( P<PERSON> = 0.002 ), and portal vein tumour thrombus ( PVTT<ORGANIZATION> ) ( P<PERSON> = 0.028 ). Cell<PERSON> proliferation, colony formation and migration in vitro were enhanced by PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> upregulation and decreased by PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> downregulation in HCC<ORGANIZATION> cell lines. Moreover, low PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> expression resulted in slow tumour growth and decreased tumour weight in vivo, as well as tumour metastasis. These phenotypes were associated with STAT3<ORGANIZATION> signalling pathway activation. Cryptotanshinone, a STAT3 inhibitor, inhibited STAT3<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation and reversed the HCC<ORGANIZATION> phenotype of PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> expression. We revealed a significant role for PRMT1<ORGANIZATION> in HCC<ORGANIZATION> progression and metastasis in vitro and in vivo via STAT3 signalling pathway activation. PRMT1 may be a potential novel prognostic biomarker and new therapeutic target for HCC<ORGANIZATION>.
