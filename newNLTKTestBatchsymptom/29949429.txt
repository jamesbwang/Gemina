 The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of add-on therapy of cabergoline versus raloxifene to long-acting somatostatin analogues ( SAs<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly. This was a prospective, randomized open label clinical trial. Forty-four patients ( 22 per group ) completed the study ; where participants received either cabergoline ( 3 mg/week ) or raloxifene ( 60 mg twice daily ) add-on therapy for 12 weeks in a parallel manner. The primary outcome was the rate of reduction in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) from baseline. Secondary outcomes comprised normalization of serum IGF-1 for age and sex. Serum<PERSON> IGF-1 was significantly decreased in both the cabergoline ( 40.3 ± 25.6 %, P<PERSON> < .001 ) and raloxifene ( 31.5 ± 24.6 %, P<PERSON> < .001 ) groups, with no significant difference between arms ( P<PERSON> > .05 ). Normalization in serum IGF-1 values occurred in 40.9 % of patients who were on cabergoline compared to 45.5 % of those receiving raloxifene ( P<PERSON> = .76 ). The subsequent logistic regression analysis highlighted baseline IGF-1 as a significant predictor of IGF-1 normalization ( odds ratio, 0.995 ; 95 % confidence interval, 0.990-0.999 ; P<PERSON> = .02 ). Using the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve analysis for the entire group, the baseline IGF-1 value of 1.47 the upper limit of normal ( ULN<ORGANIZATION> ) was the best cut-off point to identify patients with normal IGF-1 at the end of the study ( sensitivity: 52.6 %, specificity: 84.0 %, Yoden<PERSON> 's index: 0.366 ). Full biochemical control of acromegaly was achieved in 22.7 % of patients in the cabergoline group compared to 13.6 % of those in the raloxifene group ( P<PERSON> = .43 ). Cabergoline<PERSON> and raloxifene add-on therapy could effectively decrease serum IGF-1 level in patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly. The efficacy profiles of both drugs are comparable.
