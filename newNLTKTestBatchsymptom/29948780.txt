 The variability in progression-free survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) and overall survival ( OS ) among patients with epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC<ORGANIZATION> ) makes it difficult to reliably predict outcomes. A predictive biomarker of bevacizumab efficacy as first-line therapy in EOC<ORGANIZATION> is still lacking. The MITO<ORGANIZATION> group conducted a multicenter, retrospective study ( MITO<ORGANIZATION> 24 ) to investigate the role of inflammatory indexes as prognostic factors and predictors of treatment efficacy in FIGO<ORGANIZATION> stage III-IV EOC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy alone or in combination with bevacizumab. Of the 375 patients recruited, 301 received chemotherapy alone and 74 received chemotherapy with bevacizumab. The pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR<ORGANIZATION> ), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR<ORGANIZATION> ), and systemic immune inflammation index ( SII<ORGANIZATION> ) were evaluated to identify a potential correlation with PFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS in both the overall population and the two treatment arms. In the overall population, the PFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS were significantly longer in patients with low inflammatory indexes ( p < 0.0001 ). In multivariate analyses, the NLR<ORGANIZATION> was significantly associated with OS<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.016 ), and the PLR<ORGANIZATION> was significantly associated with PFS<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.024 ). Inflammatory indexes were significantly correlated with patient prognosis in the chemotherapy-alone group ( p < 0.0001 ). Patients in the chemotherapy with bevacizumab group with a high NLR<ORGANIZATION> had a higher PFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.026 and p = 0.029, respectively ) than those in the chemotherapy-alone group. Conversely, PFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS were significantly poorer in patients with a high SII<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.024 and p = 0.017, respectively ). Our results suggest that bevacizumab improves clinical outcome in patients with a high NLR but may be detrimental in those with a high SII<ORGANIZATION>.
