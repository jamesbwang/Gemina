 Nonalcoholic<GPE> fatty liver disease ( NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a highly prevalent condition which contributes to atherogenic apolipoprotein B dyslipiproteinemias. Lecithin<PERSON>: cholesterol acyltransferase ( LCAT<ORGANIZATION> ) and phospholipid transfer protein ( PLTP<ORGANIZATION> ) are both synthesized by the liver, and are important in lipid metabolism. Here we interrogated the impact of NAFLD<ORGANIZATION> on plasma LCAT<ORGANIZATION> and PLTP<ORGANIZATION> activities. Plasma LCAT<PERSON> activity ( exogenous substrate assay ) and PLTP<ORGANIZATION> activity ( phospholipid vesicles-HDL assay ) were determined in 348 subjects ( 279 men ; 81 subjects with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM<ORGANIZATION> ) ; 123 with metabolic syndrome ( MetS<ORGANIZATION> ) ). A Fatty Liver<ORGANIZATION> index ( FLI<ORGANIZATION> ) ≥60 was used as a proxy of NAFLD<ORGANIZATION>. Insulin<PERSON> resistance was determined by homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA-IR ). 147 participants had an FLI<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 60 coinciding with T2DM<ORGANIZATION> and MetS<ORGANIZATION> ( P < 0.001 for each ). Plasma LCAT<PERSON> and PLTP<ORGANIZATION> activity were on average 12 % and 5 % higher, respectively, in subjects with an FLI≥60 ( P < 0.001 for each ). In age- and sex-adjusted partial linear regression analysis, LCAT<ORGANIZATION> and PLTP<ORGANIZATION> activity were positively related to various obesity measures and HOMA-IR ( P < 0.001 for each ). In multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for age and sex, LCAT<ORGANIZATION> activity was associated with an FLI≥60 independent of T2DM<ORGANIZATION> and MetS<ORGANIZATION>, the waist/hip ratio, or HOMA-IR ( β=0.307 to 0.366, P<PERSON> < 0001 for all models ). PLTP<ORGANIZATION> activity was also associated with an FLI≥60 independent of these variables ( β=0.151 to 0223, P=0.013 to 0.001 ). NAFLD, as inferred from an FLI≥60, confers higher plasma LCAT<ORGANIZATION> and to a lesser extent PLTP<ORGANIZATION> activity, even when taking account of T2DM<ORGANIZATION>, MetS<ORGANIZATION>, central obesity and insulin resistance.
