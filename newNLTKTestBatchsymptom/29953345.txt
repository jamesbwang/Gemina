 Lipids<PERSON> convey both structural and functional properties to eukaryotic membranes. Understanding the basic lipid composition and the dynamics of these important molecules, in the context of cellular membranes, can shed light on signaling, metabolism, trafficking, and even membrane identity. The development of genetically encoded lipid biosensors has allowed for the visualization of specific lipids inside individual, living cells. However, a number of caveats and considerations have emerged with the overexpression of these biosensors. In this Technical Perspective, we provide a current list of available genetically encoded lipid biosensors, together with criteria that determine their veracity. We also provide some suggestions for the optimal utilization of these biosensors when both designing experiments and interpreting results.
