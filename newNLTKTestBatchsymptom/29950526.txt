 Hodgkin<GPE> lymphoma is a cancer that can be cured using standard chemotherapy with or without radiation. Although it accounts for only 0.6 % of all malignancy worldwide, but it usually affects young adults with median age of 38 years. About 60 to 90 % cases can be cured depending on its stage and 5 to 10 % cases are refractory to the first-line chemotherapy ; while 20 to 30 % patients experiencing relapse after receiving the first-line chemotherapy. The relapse causes new problem in treatment. A monoclonal antibody-chemotherapy conjugate, Brentuximab<GPE> vedotin, was approved by Food Drug Association<PERSON> and European<GPE> Medicine since 2011 dan was approved by European Medicine Agency<ORGANIZATION> since 2012 to treat relapsed classical Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL<ORGANIZATION> ). Brentuximab vedotin has also been known as anti-CD30.CD30 or Ki-1 or TNFRSF8<ORGANIZATION> is a 120-kD glycoprotein, which is a trans-membrane receptor of Hodgkin<GPE> lymphoma cells. The glycoprotein was first identified in 1982 using monoclonal antibody against Hodgkin<PERSON> lymphoma-derived cell lines. The glycoprotein was then cloned and recognized as a member of tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR<ORGANIZATION> ) superfamily, which has intracellular, transcellular and extracellular domains. The monoclonal antibody obviously does cause a reaction not only with the Reed-Sternberg ( RS ) cells of Hodgkin<GPE> lymphoma, but also with a small number of normal lymphocytes subset, which are located at perifollicular zone as well as lymphoid tumor such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL<ORGANIZATION> ) and other non-lymphoid tumor such as embryonic and pancreas carcinoma, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Therefore, CD30<ORGANIZATION> monoclonal antibody alone to confirm the diagnosis of Hodgkin<GPE> lymphoma is ineffective as it must be used together with other panel of immunohistochemistry antibodies such as cytokeratins, carcinoma embryonic antigen, melanoma-associated antigen and placental alkaline phosphatide.The expression of CD30<ORGANIZATION> molecules in Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin<GPE> lymphoma has been demonstrated in over 98 % of classical Hodgkin lymphoma cases ; however, there is a difference in staining intensity among various cases or even in one case.
