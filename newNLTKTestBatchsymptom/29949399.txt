 Psoriasis<GPE> is an autoimmune, inflammatory disorder characterized by proliferation of keratinocytes, and it may be associated with a systemic inflammatory articular disorder, psoriatic arthritis. The presentations of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are heterogeneous, and our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis has led to a better understanding of the vital role of the IL-23/Th17 immune axis. Areas covered: Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-12 and IL-23, and this review will focus on its role in the management of psoriatic disease. The pathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is a multifactorial process involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. IL-23 signaling and activation of Th17<GPE> cells leads to a self-perpetuating inflammatory loop resulting in continuous keratinocyte proliferation and synovitis. Treatment options are varied, ranging from topical therapy to injection of targeted biologic DMARDs<ORGANIZATION>. Evidence on the use of ustekinumab in the management of psoriasis is strong, but it is not as impressive in management of psoriatic arthritis. Expert<PERSON> Opinion: IL-12/23 inhibition appears to be a good first line option for plaque psoriasis, but efficacy in psoriatic arthritis does not compare favorably to IL-17 inhibition. In general, poorer responses to therapy with any biologic DMARD<ORGANIZATION> in psoriatic arthritis cohorts highlight psoriatic disease heterogeneity. Until new knowledge can remedy the failure of monotherapy, synergistic methods may have to be explored, including combination biologic therapy.
