 To study peripapillary comet lesions ( PCL<ORGANIZATION> ) in Italian<GPE> patients affected with pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( PXE<ORGANIZATION> ). Retrospective review of fundoscopic and swept-source ( SS ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT<ORGANIZATION> ) images of patients with PXE<ORGANIZATION> examined at the Regional Reference Center<ORGANIZATION> for Hereditary Retinal Degenerations<PERSON> at the Careggi<ORGANIZATION> Teaching Hospital of Florence<GPE> from 2012 to 2017. From 148 eyes of 74 patients affected with PXE<ORGANIZATION>, we identified 24 eyes of 14 patients ( 11 were female ) with a mean age of 39 years ( range, 20-58 years ) characterized by peripapillary comet lesions. Of these 24 eyes, 15 eyes ( of 10 patients ) were characterized by comet rain. The smallest comet lesion at the OCT<ORGANIZATION> examination appeared as a focal roundish hyper-reflective alteration at the level of the outer retinal segments and RPE-Bruch 's membrane complex ; the larger lesions appeared as circular and ovoid structures with hyper-reflective borders in the outer nuclear layer. The comet lesion formation process involves the outer layers of the retina and RPE/Bruch 's membrane complex. It consists of a degenerative/rearrangement process of the photoreceptors which occurs in an area of focal altered RPE/Bruch 's membrane resembling the outer retinal tubulation.
