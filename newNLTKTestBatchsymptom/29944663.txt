 The aims of this study were to design a mobile app that would record daily self-reported Korean<GPE> version of the Center<ORGANIZATION> for Epidemiologic Studies Depression<ORGANIZATION> Scale-Revised ( K-CESD-R ) ratings in a `` Yes '' or `` No '' format, develop two different algorithms for converting mobile K-CESD-R scores in a binary format into scores in a 5-point response format, and determine which algorithm would be more appropriately applied to the newly developed app. Algorithm ( A ) was designed to improve the scoring system of the 2-week delayed retrospective recall-based original K-CESD-R scale, and algorithm ( B ) was designed to further refine the scoring of the 24-hour delayed prospective recall-based mobile K-CESD-R scale applied with algorithm ( A ). To calculate total mobile K-CESD-R scores, each algorithm applied certain cut-off criteria for a 5-point scale with different inter-point intervals, defined by the ratio of the total number of times that users responded `` Yes '' to each item to the number of days that users reported daily depressive symptom ratings during the 2-week study period. Twenty participants were asked to complete a K-CESD-R Mobile assessment daily for 2 weeks and an original K-CESD-R assessment delivered to their e-mail accounts at the end of the 2-week study period. There was a significant difference between original and mobile algorithm ( B ) scores but not between original and mobile algorithm ( A ) scores. Of the 20 participants, 4 scored at or above the cut-off criterion ( â‰¥13 ) on either the original K-CESD-R ( n = 4 ) or the mobile K-CESD-R converted with algorithm ( A ) ( n = 3 ) or algorithm ( B ) ( n = 1 ). However, all participants were assessed as being below threshold for a diagnosis of a mental disorder during a clinician-administered diagnostic interview. Therefore, the K-CESD-R Mobile app using algorithm ( B ) could be a more potential candidate for a depression screening tool than the K-CESD-R Mobile app using algorithm ( A ).
