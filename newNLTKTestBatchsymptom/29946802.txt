 Elderly<GPE> patients with upper tract urothelial cancer ( UTUC<ORGANIZATION> ) may present with colic and microscopic haematuria, mimicking urolithiasis. Patients presenting to emergency departments with acute ureteric colic are investigated with a CT<ORGANIZATION> KUB. CT urography ( CTU<ORGANIZATION> ) identifies UTUC<ORGANIZATION> better than a CT<ORGANIZATION> KUB. Thus, there is a possibility that a CT<ORGANIZATION> KUB may miss UTUC<ORGANIZATION>. We studied patients aged 65 years or over presenting to the emergency department with ureteric colic and microscopic haematuria who had a CT<ORGANIZATION> KUB between January 2014 and October 2016. Patients who had both CT KUB and CTU<ORGANIZATION> were then compared to determine if CT<ORGANIZATION> KUB had missed a UTUC<ORGANIZATION> and if the diagnoses were concordant by the two tests. A radiologist independent from the reporting radiologists reviewed images as well as their reports. According to the Health Research Authority<ORGANIZATION>, England<GPE> regulations, we did not obtain an ethical review on a voluntary basis for this retrospective study. Four hundred eighty-five patients [ 228 ( 47.01 % ) male and 257 ( 52.99 % ) female ] had a CT<ORGANIZATION> KUB scan over the 34-month period. Their mean age was 74 ( SD 6.97 ) [ males 73 ( SD 6.42 ), females 75 ( SD 7.42 ) ] years. One hundred eighty-seven scans were normal. Ureteric calculi ( 167 ), renal calculi ( 58 ) and renal cysts ( 28 ) were most frequent diagnoses. The diagnosis was uncertain in 33 patients ( 6.8 % ) [ 16 ( 48.49 % ) males and 17 ( 51.51 % ) females ]. The mean age of this group of patients was 74 ( SD 6.64 ) [ males 73 ( SD4.43 ), females 74 ( SD7.64 ) ] years. These patients had a CTU<ORGANIZATION> for clarity. CTU<ORGANIZATION> identified one UTUC not identified by CT<ORGANIZATION> KUB ( 0.2 % ), corroborated the diagnosis of a ureteric tumour in one patient and excluded UTUC<ORGANIZATION> in two others. CTU<ORGANIZATION> diagnosed two new bladder tumours and an endometrial tumour. Diagnoses were concordant between CT<ORGANIZATION> KUB and CTU<ORGANIZATION> in 17 of 33 patients ( 51.5 % ). CT KUB scans for patients 65 years and over presenting with ureteric colic is justified. Only a small proportion of patients will subsequently require the higher radiation dose CTU<ORGANIZATION> as the probability of missing UTUC<ORGANIZATION> is low.
