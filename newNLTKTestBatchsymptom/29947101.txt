 It is important that nurses possess adequate clinical skills so that the patient receives safe and competent care. Smart<PERSON> phone applications ( apps ) can promote active learning and the long-term retention of knowledge of undergraduate students. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the thoughts and experiences of nursing students who received a smart phone, app-based physical assessment educational intervention. A qualitative descriptive approach with in-depth interviews was considered as suitable to obtain a comprehensive understanding of students ' experiences of a smart phone-enabled physical assessment course. Based on interviews with 16 nursing students following the intervention, five themes were derived from the analysis of the interview transcripts: `` the APP<ORGANIZATION> 's physical assessment scenarios are very close to real-life clinical situations, '' `` watching physical assessment videos over the APP<ORGANIZATION> is a quick way to learn what to do, '' `` the APP<ORGANIZATION> is a new way of learning that enhances thinking and reflection, '' `` some nursing students felt that it was out of their depth to analyze the scenarios in the APP<ORGANIZATION>, '' and `` the APP<ORGANIZATION> needs enhancements in stability and interactivity. '' The findings of this study showed the mobile app as an effective learning aid that promoted transferability of the nursing students ' knowledge and past experience. With the help of the APP<ORGANIZATION>, the teachers could offer timely guidance to the students.
