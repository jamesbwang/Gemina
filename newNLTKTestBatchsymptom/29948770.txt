 Rufinamide<GPE> ( RUF<ORGANIZATION> ) is a structurally unique anti-epileptic drug, used in the treatment of seizure disorders such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In the present study, we investigated whether RUF<ORGANIZATION> protected against excitotoxic neuronal damage in the mouse hippocampal CA3<ORGANIZATION> region after intraperitoneal kainic acid ( KA ) injection. Treatment with 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg RUF<ORGANIZATION> significantly decreased the KA-induced neuronal death in the hippocampal CA3<ORGANIZATION> region in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 100 mg/kg RUF<ORGANIZATION> treatment reduced the KA-induced oxidative stress-related increase of MDA<ORGANIZATION> level and decrease of total SOD<ORGANIZATION> activity in the hippocampus. KA-induced increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, levels as well as KA-induced microglial activation were also suppressed by RUF<ORGANIZATION> treatment. These results indicate that RUF<ORGANIZATION> displays a neuroprotective effect against KA-induced excitotoxic neuronal death in the mouse hippocampus through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.
