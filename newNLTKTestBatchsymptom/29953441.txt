 Physical<GPE> activity is associated with a lower risk of breast, colon, and endometrial cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms such as changes in DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation may help to explain these protective effects. We assessed the impact of a one year aerobic exercise intervention on DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation biomarkers believed to play a role in carcinogenesis. The Alberta Physical Activity<ORGANIZATION> and Breast Cancer<PERSON> Prevention ( ALPHA<ORGANIZATION> ) Trial<PERSON> was a two-armed randomized controlled trial in 320 healthy, inactive, postmenopausal women with no history of cancer. In an ancillary analysis, frozen blood samples ( n = 256 ) were reassessed for levels of DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation within LINE-1 and Alu<ORGANIZATION> repeats as well as within the promoter regions of APC<ORGANIZATION>, BRCA1<ORGANIZATION>, RASSF1<ORGANIZATION>, and hTERT<ORGANIZATION> genes. Differences between the exercise and control arm at 12-months, after adjusting for baseline values, were estimated within an intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis using linear regression. No significant differences in DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation between the exercise and control arms were observed. In an exploratory analysis, we found that the prospective change in estimated VO2max<ORGANIZATION> was negatively associated with RASSF1<ORGANIZATION> methylation in a dose-response manner ( p-trend = 0.04 ). A year-long aerobic exercise intervention does not affect LINE-1, Alu<PERSON>, APC<ORGANIZATION>, BRCA1<ORGANIZATION>, RASSF1<ORGANIZATION>, or hTERT methylation in healthy, inactive, postmenopausal women. Changes in DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation within these genomic regions may not mediate the association between physical activity and cancer in healthy postmenopausal women. Additional research is needed to validate our findings with RASSF1<ORGANIZATION> methylation. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00522262.
