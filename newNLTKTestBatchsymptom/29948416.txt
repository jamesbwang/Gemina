 The dominance structure of primate social groups varies widely. In addition to the groups ' composition, intrinsic attributes such as sex, body size and life experience are important factors that can affect hierarchical dominance relations. All primates are social animals, and the social environment has a direct influence on the physiological conditions of vital systems such as immunological, reproductive and cardiovascular systems. In this study, we analyze the hierarchical structure of Saimiri<GPE> collinsi in captivity, including the hierarchical structure type, the influence of individual intrinsic characteristics ( sex, age, weight and origin-born in captivity or in the wild ) based on the prior-attributes model, the relation between agonistic behavior frequency and hierarchical position, and hierarchy steepness, which represents the dominance gradient. We found that the group order was characterized by a partial hierarchy: a dominance position could be occupied by more than one individual simultaneously, including individuals of both sexes. Intrinsic characteristics had no influence on hierarchical structure, with the exception of the male in the highest hierarchical position, which had a markedly larger body than all other group members. Thus, the prior-attributes model did not apply to hierarchical formation of S. collinsi in captivity. Only the frequency of agonistic behavior of males correlated with their hierarchical position, and they differed from all other group members in their more aggressive behavior. The steepness between adjacent positions along the dominance gradient was significant only between the dominant male and the next individual in the group, with a smooth gradient between the other positions in the rank. As the access to resources is directly related to hierarchical dominance, a smooth dominance gradient is to be expected in species that form very large groups, such as wild Saimiri populations.
