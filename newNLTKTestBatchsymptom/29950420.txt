 Following the initial detection of viral infection, innate immune responses trigger the induction of numerous interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs<ORGANIZATION> ) to inhibit virus replication and dissemination. One such ISG<ORGANIZATION> encodes cholesterol-25-hydroxylase ( CH25H<ORGANIZATION> ), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol to form a soluble product, 25-hydroxycholesterol ( 25HC ). Recent studies have found that CH25H<ORGANIZATION> is broadly antiviral ; it inhibits infection by several viruses. For enveloped viruses, 25HC inhibits membrane fusion, likely by altering membrane characteristics such as hydrophobicity or cholesterol aggregation. However, mechanisms by which 25HC restricts infection of non-enveloped viruses are unknown. We examined whether 25HC restricts infection by mammalian reovirus. Treatment with 25HC restricted infection by reovirus prototype strains type 1 Lang<PERSON> and type 3 Dearing. In contrast to reovirus virions, 25HC did not restrict infection by reovirus infectious subvirion particles, ISVPs<ORGANIZATION>, which can penetrate either directly at the cell surface or in early endosomal membranes. Treatment with 25HC altered trafficking of reovirus particles to late endosomes and delayed the kinetics of reovirus uncoating. These results suggest that 25HC inhibits the efficiency of cellular entry of reovirus virions, which may require specific endosomal membrane dynamics for efficient membrane penetration.
