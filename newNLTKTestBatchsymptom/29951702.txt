 Friedreich<GPE> ataxia ( FRDA<ORGANIZATION> ) is an inherited movement disorder which manifests with progressive gait instability, sensory loss and cardiomyopathy. Peripheral neuropathy is an established feature of FRDA<ORGANIZATION>. At neuropathological examination, a depletion of large, myelinated axons is evident, but also unmyelinated fibers are affected which may result in a variety of sensory and autonomic signs and symptoms. Impaired temperature perception, vasomotor disturbances of lower extremities and a high prevalence of urinary symptoms have been documented in FRDA<GPE>, but data from autonomic function testing in genetically confirmed cases are lacking. Genetically<PERSON> confirmed FRDAs<ORGANIZATION> were recruited in an outpatient setting. In a screening visit, general and neurological examination, laboratory testing, ECG<ORGANIZATION> and echocardiography were performed. Autonomic functions were evaluated by means of systematic questionnaires ( SCOPA-Aut, OHQ<ORGANIZATION> ), skin sympathetic reflex and cardiovascular autonomic function testing ( CAFT<ORGANIZATION> ). For the latter, a comparison with matched healthy controls was performed. 20 patients were recruited and 13 underwent CAFT<ORGANIZATION>. Symptoms<PERSON> referred to multiple autonomic domains, particularly bladder function, thermoregulation and sweating were reported. SCOPA-Aut scores were significantly predicted by disease severity. At CAFT<ORGANIZATION>, FRDAs<ORGANIZATION> did not differ from controls except for increased heart rate at rest and during orthostatic challenge. Two patients had non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ( 14 % ). Skin<PERSON> sympathetic responses were pathologic in 3 out of 10 patients ( of whom 2 aged > 50 ). FRDA<ORGANIZATION> patients may experience several autonomic symptoms and overall their burden correlates with disease severity. Nonetheless, clinical testing shows no major involvement of sudomotor and cardiovascular autonomic function.
