 BACKGROUND<ORGANIZATION> Synovitis<PERSON> is an important disease that cause intractable pain in temporomandibular joint ( TMJ<ORGANIZATION> ), and the inflammation process played a crucial role in the initiation and development of temporomandibular joint disorder. A series of investigations suggested that the increasing expression of interleukin- ( IL ) 1β secreted by synovial lining cells plays an important role in synovial inflammation and cartilage destruction in TMJ<ORGANIZATION>. In this present study, we investigated the signaling pathways which regulate the expression of IL-1β. MATERIAL<ORGANIZATION> AND METHODS<ORGANIZATION> The occlusal interference animal model was created to induce synovial injury. Forty-eight rats were divided into 4 groups: 1 ) control group, 2 ) occlusal interference group, 3 ) TAK-242 ( a specific inhibitor targeting the Toll-like receptor ( TLR<ORGANIZATION> ) -4 ) group, and 4 ) SB203580<ORGANIZATION> ( a specific inhibitor targeting the p38 ) group. The inflammation changes were observed, and the expression of p38 and IL-1β in the synovial membranes were assayed. RESULTS The results showed that downstream p38 MAPK<ORGANIZATION> ( mitogen-activated protein kinase ) signaling was triggered following the activation of TLR4<ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, the injection of SB203580<ORGANIZATION> could inhibit the inflammatory reactions and the increased expression of IL-1β at both mRNA<ORGANIZATION> and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS The results prompted us that TLR4<ORGANIZATION> may stimulates synovial inflammatory reactions and increased expression of IL-1β in rats through the activation of p38 MAPK<ORGANIZATION> signaling pathway, p38 was an important mediator in the mechanisms of the initiation and development of synovial injury by regulating the expression of IL-1β in synovial membranes.
