 Eisenmenger<GSP> syndrome represents severe, irreversible, and end-stage pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH<ORGANIZATION> ) associated with congenital heart defects. For long-term outcome optimal right ventricular ( RV ) adaptation is crucial with precise assessment of its hypertrophy, dilatation and function. Associations of electrocardiographic ( ECG<ORGANIZATION> ) and echocardiographic ( ECHO<ORGANIZATION> ) RV characteristics were analyzed. Included were 52 patients ( 39F/13M ), median age 45 years ( 24-78 ). Following ECG<ORGANIZATION> parameters were analyzed: Butler-Leggett formula ( B-L ), Sokolow-Lyon criterion ( S-L ), QRS<ORGANIZATION> duration ( QRS<ORGANIZATION> ), maximum spatial QRS<ORGANIZATION> vector magnitude ( QRS<ORGANIZATION> max ) ; and ECHO<ORGANIZATION> parameters: RV diameter ( RVd<ORGANIZATION> ), RV<ORGANIZATION> wall thickness ( RVAW<ORGANIZATION> ), RV/LV function. Following significant ECG-ECHO associations were demonstrated: S-L criterion and B-L formula with RVAW<ORGANIZATION> ( p 120 ms only with severely dilated RV ( RVd<ORGANIZATION> > 45 mm ), while QRS<ORGANIZATION> max 33 mm ) ; A new combined scoring system was introduced. In Eisenmenger<GPE> syndrome RV hypertrophy is compensatory ; diagnosis of prognostically unfavorable RV dilatation is therefore important. Combined ECG-ECHO analysis enables more accurate risk stratification. QRS<ORGANIZATION> duration > 120 ms seems to be a late marker ; QRS<ORGANIZATION> max together with ECHO<ORGANIZATION> parameters may help to distinguish patients at higher risk for clinical deterioration ( Tab<ORGANIZATION>. 3, Fig<PERSON>. 8, Ref<PERSON>. 53 ).
