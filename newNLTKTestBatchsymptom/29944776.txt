 Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist ( NAVA<ORGANIZATION> ) is expected to improve respiratory outcomes in preterm infants ; however, it has not yet been evaluated. We investigated whether NAVA<ORGANIZATION> could improve respiratory outcomes and reduce sedation use in extremely low birth weight infants ( ELBWIs<ORGANIZATION> ). A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on patient charts at Nagano Children<FACILITY> 's Hospital<ORGANIZATION> NICU, Japan<GPE>. Infants who were born at less than 27-weeks gestation were included. We assessed the prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD<ORGANIZATION> ), home oxygen therapy ( HOT<ORGANIZATION> ), duration of intubation, and sedation use. We investigated the use of NAVA<ORGANIZATION> in14 ELBWIs who were born at less than 27-weeks gestation between September 2013 and September 2015 as the NAVA<ORGANIZATION> group. A total of 21 ELBWIs<ORGANIZATION> born between September 2011 and September 2013, before NAVA<ORGANIZATION> implementation, served as the control group. There were no significant differences in the perinatal background characteristics between the two groups. For respiratory outcomes, no significant between-group differences were found in the prevalence of BPD<ORGANIZATION> and HOT<ORGANIZATION> or the duration of intubation. The total duration of sedation use was not significantly different between the two groups ; however, in the NAVA<ORGANIZATION> group, midazolam was discontinued in all cases after the infants were switched to NAVA<ORGANIZATION>. NAVA<ORGANIZATION> was safe in preterm infants and showed a similar effect compared to conventional ventilation in respiratory outcomes and sedation use in the chronic phase ; thus, NAVA<ORGANIZATION> could be attempted initially or at least before BPD<ORGANIZATION> established, to improve respiratory outcomes in ELBWIs<GPE>.
