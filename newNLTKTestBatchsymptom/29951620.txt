 The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH<ORGANIZATION> ) and severity of acute pancreatitis ( AP<ORGANIZATION> ) measured by the revised Atlanta<GPE> classification ( RAC<ORGANIZATION> ) and determinant-based classification ( DBC<ORGANIZATION> ). Secondary objectives were to assess IAH<ORGANIZATION> as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in the ICU<ORGANIZATION>. This prospective international observational study included patients admitted to the ICU<ORGANIZATION> with AP<ORGANIZATION> and at least one organ failure. Information was collected on demographics, severity scores at admission using RAC<ORGANIZATION> and DBC<ORGANIZATION>, organ failure, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT<ORGANIZATION> ), surgery and mortality. Maximum<PERSON> intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP<ORGANIZATION> ) during ICU<ORGANIZATION> stay was used for analysis. Some 374 patients were included. The hospital mortality rate was 28·9 per cent. IAP<ORGANIZATION> was measured in 301 patients ( 80·5 per cent ), of whom 274 ( 91·0 per cent ) had IAH<ORGANIZATION> and 103 ( 34·2 per cent ) acute compartment syndrome. A higher IAH<ORGANIZATION> grade was more likely in patients with severe AP<ORGANIZATION> ( 42 per cent for grade I versus 84 per cent for grade IV ) and acute critical pancreatitis ( 9 versus 25 per cent ; P<PERSON> = 0·001 ). Compared with grade I IAH<ORGANIZATION>, patients with grade IV had more infected necrosis ( 16 versus 28 per cent ; P<PERSON> = 0·005 ), need for surgery ( 27 versus 50 per cent ; P<PERSON> = 0·006 ), mechanical ventilation ( 53 versus 84 per cent ; P<PERSON> = 0·007 ) and requirement for CRRT<ORGANIZATION> ( 22 versus 66 per cent ; P<PERSON> < 0·001 ). IAH<ORGANIZATION> predicted shock ( area under receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) 0·79, 95 per cent c.i. 0·73 to 0·84 ), respiratory failure ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> 0·82, 0·77 to 0·87 ), renal failure ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> 0·93, 0·89 to 0·96 ) and mortality ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> 0·89, 0·86 to 0·93 ). IAH<ORGANIZATION> was associated with severity of AP<ORGANIZATION> classified according to both RAC<ORGANIZATION> and DBC<ORGANIZATION> systems. IAP<ORGANIZATION> grade can predict outcome of AP<ORGANIZATION> during ICU<ORGANIZATION> stay.
