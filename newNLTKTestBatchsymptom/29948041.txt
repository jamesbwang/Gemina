 In forensic clinical anatomy computed tomography ( CT ) is used in post-mortem radiological investigation as an objective nondestructive documentation of the body surface and of the interior of the body. This technique is applied also in paleopathology, in particular in mummy studies, with the aim of providing a permanent record of the mummy 's features, investigating the embalming procedure employed and analyzing the extent of the preservation in detail. For the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy<GPE>, the mortal remains of Saint Leopold Mandic<PERSON> and Saint Pio<PERSON> da Pietralcina<GPE>, as examples of Mercy<GPE> known by everyone, have been brought to Rome<GPE> in February 2016. During the survey that preceded the preparation for transport to Rome<GPE>, a whole-body CT was performed on the mummified corpse of Leopold Mandic<PERSON>, Capuchin Saint<PERSON> of Padova<GPE>, Italy<GPE>. The CT<ORGANIZATION> examination demonstrated the presence of osteoarthritis at the level of the vertebral column, of the left knee and of the left hand. Moreover, CT<ORGANIZATION> showed the preservation of skeleton and partial preservation of the some viscera, such as remnants of the brain, heart, oesophagus, urinary bladder, plexuses and spinal nerves, ear ossicles, major arterial vessels ( aorta and carotid arteries ). It is to emphasize the fact that Saint Leopold<PERSON> was not subjected before the CT<ORGANIZATION> to any conservative treatment. Computed tomography demonstrated to be a non-destructive method to investigate Saint Leopold<PERSON>, in order to maintain the integrity of the body and to acquire data on his pathologies and on his preservation. CT allows not only the acquisition of sectional images but also, thanks to dedicated software, the post-processing and reconstruction of three-dimensional models, that can be used also for public displays.
