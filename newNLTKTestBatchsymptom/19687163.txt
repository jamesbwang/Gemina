 This study was conducted to determine the role of obesity and race in intracerebral haemorrhage ( ICH<ORGANIZATION> ) outcomes. The Get with the guideline-Stroke database was queried for all admitted patients with spontaneous ICH<ORGANIZATION>. Secondary causes of ICH<ORGANIZATION> were excluded. Body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ) was classified using the Center<ORGANIZATION> for Disease Control<PERSON> guidelines. Race<PERSON> was classified as White<FACILITY> or non-White. Demographics, clinical, imaging data were retrieved. Outcome measures were hematoma expansion at 24 h and discharge disposition. A total of 428 patients were included in our analysis. Female<PERSON> gender, past history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, HbA1c<ORGANIZATION>, blood pressure, ICH<ORGANIZATION> volume, ICH<ORGANIZATION> location, intraventricular haemorrhage and hospital length of stay deferred across BMI<ORGANIZATION> categories. On multivariate analysis, along with obese categories, age, ICH<ORGANIZATION> location and ICH<ORGANIZATION> volume were independent predictors of poor outcomes ( hematoma expansion and poor discharge disposition ). After adjusting for these variables, obesity remained a predictor of poor disposition outcome compared with normal and overweight subjects ; Normal<GPE> vs. Obese<PERSON> OR 0.26 CI 0.115-0.593 p = 0.0014 ; Obese<GPE> vs. Overweight<PERSON> OR 3.79 CI 1.68-8.52 p = 0.0013. Nonetheless, obesity did not influence hematoma expansion. Overall, BMI-race classification did not influence outcomes. However, among non-Whites, the obese category had higher odds of a poor disposition outcome than normal ( OR 6.84 CI 2.12-22.22 p = 0.0013 ) or overweight ( OR 8.45 CI 2.6-27.49 p = 0.0004 ) categories. An obesity paradox in ICH<ORGANIZATION> was not observed in our cohort. In the non-White population, patients with obesity were likely to be associated with poor disposition outcome. Similar findings were not observed in White<GPE> population.
