 MXenes, a family of two-dimensional transition-metal carbide and nitride materials, are supposed to be the promising materials in energy storage because of the high electronic conductivity, hydrophilic surfaces and low diffusion barriers. MXenes are generally prepared by removing the `` A '' elements ( A = Al<PERSON>, Si<GPE>, Sn<GPE>, etc. ) from their corresponding MAX<ORGANIZATION> phases by using hydrofluoric acid ( HF ) and the other etching agents, despite the fact that these `` A '' elements usually have great volumetric and gravimetric capacities. Herein<PERSON>, we studied the etching progress of Ti3AlC2<ORGANIZATION> and evaluated their anode performance in Lithium-ion batteries. We found that a partially etched sample ( 0.5h-peTi3C2Tx ) showed much higher capacity ( 160 mA h g-1, 331.6 mA h cm-3 at 1C ) when compared with the fully etched Ti3C2Tx<GPE> ( 110 mA h g-1, 190.3 mA h cm-3 at 1C ). Besides, a 99 % capacity retention was observed even after 1000 cycles in the 0.5h-peTi3C2Tx anode. This interesting result can be explained, at least in part, by the alloying of the residue Al element during lithiation.
