 Loren<GPE> ( Larry<PERSON> ) H. Parsons<PERSON> passed away at the age of 51. In spite of his premature departure, Larry<PERSON> much contributed to the drug abuse field. Since his graduate studies for the Ph.D. in Chemistry<GPE> in J.B. Justice lab, microdialysis is the tread that links Larry<PERSON> 's research topics, namely, the role of dopamine ( DA<ORGANIZATION> ), serotonin ( 5-HT ), gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA<ORGANIZATION> ), glutamate and endocannabinoids ( eCBs<ORGANIZATION> ) in drug reinforcement and dependence. Larry<PERSON> was the first to show that abstinence from chronic cocaine reduces extracellular DA in the NAc<ORGANIZATION>, consistent with the so called 'dopamine depletion hypothesis ' of cocaine addiction. Another Larry<PERSON> 's major contributions are the studies on 5-HT and 5-HT receptors ' role in cocaine stimulant actions, which resulted in the identification of 5-HT1B receptors as a critical substrate of cocaine reinforcement. By applying mass spectrometry to eCBs analysis in brain dialysates, Larry<PERSON> 's lab showed that ethanol, heroin, nicotine and cocaine differentially affect anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglicerol overflow in the NAc<ORGANIZATION> shell, a critical site of drugs of abuse DA stimulant actions. Larry<PERSON> also applied microdialysis to study GABA<ORGANIZATION> and glutamate 's role in ethanol dependence and heroin reinforcement, providing in vivo evidence for a sensitization of corticotropin-releasing factor-dependent release of GABA<ORGANIZATION> in the central amygdala in withdrawal from chronic ethanol and for a reduction of GABA<ORGANIZATION> transmission in the ventral pallidum in heroin but not cocaine intravenous self-administration. Larry<PERSON> showed the wide possibilities of microdialysis as a general purpose methodology for monitoring neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the brain extracellular compartment. From this viewpoint, he stands as the best advocate for microdialysis.
