 Due to the cyclic function of the human heart, pressure and flow in the circulation are pulsatile rather than continuous. Addressing pulsatile haemodynamics starts with the most convenient measurement, brachial pulse pressure, which is widely available, related to development and treatment of heart failure ( HF ), but often confounded in patients with established HF. The next level of analysis consists of central ( rather than brachial ) pressures and, more importantly, of wave reflections. The latter are closely related to left ventricular late systolic afterload, ventricular remodelling, diastolic dysfunction, exercise capacity, and, in the long-term, the risk of new-onset HF. Wave<PERSON> reflection may also represent a suitable therapeutic target. Treatments for HF with preserved and reduced ejection fraction, based on a reduction of wave reflection, are emerging. A full understanding of ventricular-arterial coupling, however, requires dedicated analysis of time-resolved pressure and flow signals, which can be readily accomplished with contemporary non-invasive imaging and modelling techniques. This review provides a summary of our current understanding of pulsatile haemodynamics in HF.
