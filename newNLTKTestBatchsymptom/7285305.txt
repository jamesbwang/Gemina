 This review paper describes the management of patients with dextro-transposition of the great arteries ( D-TGA ) with a focus on the complications seen and the appropriate care required to identify and prevent adverse events. D-TGA is a form of cyanotic congenital heart disease ( CHD<ORGANIZATION> ) representing ~ 3 % of all CHD and almost 20 % of all cyanotic CHD<ORGANIZATION>. Since the late 1980s, standard of care is to repair these patients with an arterial switch operation ( ASO<ORGANIZATION> ) as opposed to a Mustard/Senning operation. The long-term survival and complication rates are superior in the ASO<ORGANIZATION>. Long-term follow-up is recommended for all D-TGA patients and includes management with adult congenital heart disease specialists and the use of echocardiography and advanced imaging with CT<ORGANIZATION> or MRI<ORGANIZATION>. The most common complications seen are pulmonary stenosis, coronary artery stenosis, and neo-aortic regurgitation. Careful<PERSON> evaluation of new symptoms or declining function is essential in preventing and treating these long-term sequelae.
