 We have reported that hypertrophic adipocytes release extracellular vesicles ( EVs<ORGANIZATION> ) and that number of circulating adipocyte-derived EVs<ORGANIZATION> correlated with insulin and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) in a pilot study using obese patients. Here, we explored the association between circulating EV<ORGANIZATION> level and various metabolic parameters, including obesity and lipid and glucose metabolisms among 203 subjects ( 76 men, 127 women ; median age, 54 years ) with or without risk factor for metabolic diseases, who received a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT<ORGANIZATION> ). Circulating EV number was significantly higher in men than in women ( p & lt ; 0.001 ). Circulating EV number in individuals with impaired OGTT<ORGANIZATION> pattern was significantly higher compared to those with normal OGTT<ORGANIZATION> pattern ( p & lt ; 0.05 ). Multiple regression analysis revealed that circulating EV number correlated most strongly and significantly with elevated triglyceride ( TG ) ( t=8.55, p & lt ; 0.001 ). Additionally, circulating EV number correlated significantly with homeostasis model assessment-beta cell function ( HOMA-β ) ( t=2.38, p & lt ; 0.05 ). Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed the cut off value of EV<ORGANIZATION> numbers in individuals with elevated serum TG levels ( ≧ 150mg/dL ) was identified ( 136,738 EVs/μl of plasma, p & lt ; 0.001, sensitivity 0.842, false positive rate 0.257 ). Perilipin<PERSON> and asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 were detected on a part of isolated circulating EVs<ORGANIZATION>, indicating EV release from adipocytes and hepatocytes, which were related to lipid and glucose metabolism. Circulating EVs<ORGANIZATION> represent a promising metabolic biomarker for lipid and glucose metabolism and have potential for monitoring metabolic status in humans, including individuals without metabolic risk factors.
