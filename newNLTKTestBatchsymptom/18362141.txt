 Fragile<PERSON> X syndrome ( FXS<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most prevalent inherited intellectual disability, resulting from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein ( FMRP<ORGANIZATION> ). Patients with FXS<ORGANIZATION> suffer lifelong cognitive disabilities, but the function of FMRP<ORGANIZATION> in the adult brain and the mechanism underlying age-related cognitive decline in FXS<ORGANIZATION> is not fully understood. Here, we report that a loss of FMRP<ORGANIZATION> results in increased protein synthesis of histone acetyltransferase EP300<ORGANIZATION> and ubiquitination-mediated degradation of histone deacetylase HDAC1 in adult hippocampal neural stem cells ( NSCs<ORGANIZATION> ). Consequently, FMRP-deficient NSCs<ORGANIZATION> exhibit elevated histone acetylation and age-related NSC<ORGANIZATION> depletion, leading to cognitive impairment in mature adult mice. Reducing histone acetylation rescues both neurogenesis and cognitive deficits in mature adult FMRP-deficient mice. Our work reveals a role for FMRP<ORGANIZATION> and histone acetylation in cognition and presents a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating adult FXS<ORGANIZATION> patients.
