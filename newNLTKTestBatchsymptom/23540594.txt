 Bullous<GPE> pemphigoid is the most common of the blistering disorders. It is most commonly found in the elderly and is diagnosed based on clinical, histologic, and immunologic criteria. It presents clinically with diffuse eczematous, pruritic, urticaria-like lesions, with the later appearance of tense bullae or blistering lesions typically filled with clear fluid. Histologically<PERSON>, a sub-epidermal blister is seen and immunofluorescence shows immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against the structural components of the keratinocytic hemidesmosomal proteins BP180<ORGANIZATION> and BP230<ORGANIZATION>. Multiple treatment modalities are present for this condition, including anti-inflammatory medications, medications that reduce antibody formation, and treatments to increase the elimination of antibodies. The aim of this case report is to present a classic case of this condition, to highlight an awareness of differing treatment options, and to advocate referral to a dermatologist given its potential severity.
