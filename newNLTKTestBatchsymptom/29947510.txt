 Practical<GPE> utilization of silicon ( Si ) for Li-ion batteries ( LIBs<ORGANIZATION> ) still remains sluggish because of its formidable kinetic problems of huge volume expansions over 300 %, instable solid electrolyte interphase ( SEI<ORGANIZATION> ), and unsatisfactory electrical conductivity. Though using a yolk-shell ( Y-S ) Si @ C nanodesign indeed helps to mitigate active changes, optimize SEI<ORGANIZATION> properties, and lower intrinsic charge-transfer impedances, the total anodic behaviors in reversibility, rate capabilities, and long-lasting cyclability are still far from perfect. To settle the above issues, we herein propose a reliable and effective way by putting tough and malleable Ni nanoarmors on Y-S Si @ C nanoparticles ( Si @ C⊆Ni ). The unique functionalized configurations endow such hybrid systems with superb reversible capacity retention ( almost no capacity decay emerges in 600 cycles, retaining a reversible capacity beyond ∼1307 mA h g ∼423 W h kg
