 Country<GPE> decisions to scale-up `` test and treat '' approaches for HIV depend on consideration of both the health and economic consequences of such investments. Evidence about economic impacts of expanded antiretroviral therapy ( ART<ORGANIZATION> ) provision is particularly relevant for decisions regarding foreign assistance levels for HIV/AIDS programs. We used baseline data from the Sustainable East Africa<ORGANIZATION> Research in Community Health<ORGANIZATION> ( SEARCH<ORGANIZATION> ) cluster randomized controlled trial in Kenya<GPE> and Uganda<GSP> to examine the association between HIV<ORGANIZATION> status, CD4+ T-cell counts, viral suppression, and multiple indicators of economic well-being. Socio-economic surveys were conducted in households with HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults sampled after a census of 32 communities participating in the SEARCH<ORGANIZATION> trial ( NCT01864603<ORGANIZATION> ). Data were obtained for 11,500 individuals from 5,884 households in study communities. Participants were stratified based on their own HIV status as well as CD4<ORGANIZATION> counts and viral suppression status if they were HIV-positive. HIV-negative participants residing in households with no HIV-positive adults were considered separately from HIV-negative participants residing in households with ≥1 HIV-positive adult. Generalized estimating equation models were used to examine the relationship between HIV<ORGANIZATION> status, CD4<ORGANIZATION> counts, ART<ORGANIZATION>, viral suppression, and outcomes of employment, self-reported illness, lost time from usual activities due to illness, healthcare utilization, health expenditures, and hospitalizations. In all models, HIV-negative participants in households with no HIV-positive persons were the reference group. There was no significant difference in the probability of being employed between HIV-positive participants with CD4<ORGANIZATION> > 500 and the reference group of HIV-negative participants residing in households with no HIV-positive adults ( marginal effect, ME<ORGANIZATION>, 1.49 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval, CI<ORGANIZATION>, -1.09, 4.08 ). However, HIV-positive participants with CD4<ORGANIZATION> 351-500 were less likely to be employed than the reference group ( ME<ORGANIZATION> -4.50, 95 % CI -7.99, -1.01 ), as were HIV-positive participants with CD4<ORGANIZATION> ≤350 ( ME<ORGANIZATION> -7.41, 95 % CI -10.96, -3.85 ). Similarly, there was no significant difference in employment likelihood between HIV-negative participants who resided in households with a CD4<ORGANIZATION> > 500 HIV-positive person and the reference group ( ME<ORGANIZATION> -1.78, 95 % CI -5.16, 1.59 ). HIV-negative participants residing with an HIV-positive person with CD4<ORGANIZATION> 351-500, however, were less likely to be employed than the reference group ( ME<ORGANIZATION> -7.03, 95 % CI -11.49, -2.57 ), as were people residing with a household member with CD4<ORGANIZATION> ≤350 ( ME<ORGANIZATION> -6.28, 95 % CI -10.76, -1.80 ). HIV-positive participants in all CD4 categories were more likely to have lost time from usual activities due to illness and have incurred healthcare expenditures. Those with CD4<ORGANIZATION> > 500 had better economic outcomes than those with CD4<ORGANIZATION> 351-500, even among those not virally suppressed ( p = 0.004 ) and not on ART<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.01 ). Data from a large population-representative sample of households in east Africa<PERSON> showed a strong association between the health of HIV-positive persons and economic outcomes. The findings suggest there may be economic benefits associated with maintaining high CD4<ORGANIZATION> counts, both for HIV-positive persons and their HIV-negative household members. The association of high CD4<ORGANIZATION> counts with improved outcomes is consistent with the hypothesis that early ART<ORGANIZATION> initiation can avert declines in employment and other economic outcomes. Prospective longitudinal evaluation is needed to assess the causal impact of early ART<ORGANIZATION> initiation on economic functioning of households.
