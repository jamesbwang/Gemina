 Porcine<GPE> circovirus type 3 ( PCV3<ORGANIZATION> ) was firstly detected in 2016 in USA<ORGANIZATION>. Later PCV3<PERSON> was discovered in Asia<GPE>, Europe<GPE>, and South America<GPE>. The present investigation demonstrates for the first time the circulation of PCV3<ORGANIZATION> among pigs in Russia<GPE>. The viruses were detected at two geographically distant unrelated commercial farms with records of reproductive failure ( abortions, stillbirth ), porcine dermatitis, and nephropathy syndrome ( PDNS<ORGANIZATION> ). The two farms were located in the region of Smolensk<GPE> ( western part of Russia<GPE> ) and the region of Tyumen<GPE> ( West Siberia<LOCATION>, Russia<GPE> ). We investigated samples collected from pigs of different ages. We performed PCR<ORGANIZATION> for the PCV3<ORGANIZATION> DNA detection. The DNA of<ORGANIZATION> PCV3<ORGANIZATION> was detected in serum, kidney, heart, spleen, pleural effusion, and peritoneal cavity fluid samples. Two viral genomes were sequenced and the corresponding strains were named PCV3-RU/SM17 ( the strain from Smolensk<GPE> region ) and PCV3-RU/TY17 ( the strain from Tyumen<GPE> region ). The full genome sequences of both strains were 2000 nucleotides in length and contained at least two ORFs<ORGANIZATION>, encoding the Cap<ORGANIZATION> and Rep proteins. Full sequence alignment revealed a 99.3 % identity between the PCV3-RU/SM17 and PCV3-RU/TY17 strains. Molecular analysis showed that the two strains from Russia<GPE> are highly homologous to viruses identified in other countries, with a 98.5-99.6 % homology for PCV3-RU/TY17 and 97.9-99.0 for PCV3-RU/SM17. The PCV3-RU/SM17 and PCV3-RU/TY17 strains were found to form a monophyletic group in a phylogenetic tree based on PCV3<ORGANIZATION> complete genome sequences.
