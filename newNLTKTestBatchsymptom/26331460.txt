 A 72-year-old woman with symptomatic and drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( AF ) underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA<ORGANIZATION> ). She had a history of a total right lung excision. Her chest X-ray and computed tomography ( CT ) revealed a severely sight-sided dislocation of the heart. Thus, the procedure was carefully performed under guidance of a CT, intracardiac echogram, atriography, and 3D mapping system. Finally, the AF<ORGANIZATION> was successfully treated by RFCA<ORGANIZATION> without any complications.
