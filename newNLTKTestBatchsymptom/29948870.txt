 Obesity<GPE> surgery mortality risk scoring system ( OS-MRS ) classifies patients into high, intermediate and low risk, based on age, body mass index, sex and other comorbidities such as hypertension and history of pulmonary embolism. High-risk patients not only have a higher mortality but are more likely to develop post-operative complications necessitating intervention or prolonged hospital stay following bariatric surgery. Endoscopically placed duodenal-jejunal bypass sleeve ( Endobarrier ) has been designed to achieve weight loss and improve glycaemic control in morbidly obese patients with clinically proven effectiveness. The aim of this study was to assess if pre-operative insertion of endobarrier in high-risk patients can decrease morbidity and length of stay after bariatric surgery. Between 2012 and 2014, a cohort of 11 high-risk patients had an Endobarrier inserted ( E & BS<ORGANIZATION> group ) for 1 year prior to definitive bariatric surgery. These patients were compared against a similar group undergoing primary bariatric surgery ( PBS<ORGANIZATION> group ) during same duration. The two groups were matched for age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, surgical procedure and OS-MRS using propensity score matching. Outcome measures included operative time, morbidity, length of stay, intensive therapy unit ( ITU<ORGANIZATION> ) stay, readmission rate, percentage excess weight loss ( % EWL ) and percentage total weight loss ( % TWL ). Patient characteristics and OS-MRS were similar in both groups ( match tolerance 0.1 ). There was no significant difference in total length of stay, readmission rate, % EWL<ORGANIZATION> and % TWL<ORGANIZATION>. Operative time, ITU<ORGANIZATION> stay, post-operative complications and severity of complications were significantly less in the E & BS<ORGANIZATION> group ( p < 0.05 ) with significant likelihood of planned ITU<ORGANIZATION> admissions in the PBS<ORGANIZATION> group ( p < 0.05 ). Endobarrier could be considered as a pre bariatric surgical intervention in high-risk patients. It may result in improved post-operative outcomes in high-risk bariatric patients.
