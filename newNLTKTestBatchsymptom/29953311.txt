 Poxvirus<GPE> infections have been reported in domestic, captive, and wild avian hosts including many raptor species. A wild Common Buzzard<ORGANIZATION> ( Buteo buteo ) admitted to a wildlife veterinary clinic in Sardinia<GPE>, Italy<GPE>, showed multiple, wart-like proliferative cutaneous lesions on both legs. Histologically, there was ballooning degeneration and large intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies consistent with avipoxvirus ( APV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection. Diagnosis<PERSON> was confirmed by PCR<ORGANIZATION> detecting APV<ORGANIZATION> genes: P4b ( locus fpv167 ), P35<GPE> ( locus fpv140 ), and partial DNA<ORGANIZATION> polymerase. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to compare the detected virus with a panel of selected APVs<ORGANIZATION>. Analyses of P4b<ORGANIZATION> and DNA<ORGANIZATION> polymerase assigned the virus to clade A ( fowlpox virus, FWPV<ORGANIZATION> ), subclade A7, grouping with many other APVs<ORGANIZATION> previously isolated in birds of prey. Further research should highlight the diversity of avian pox viral strains circulating among common buzzards as well as the phylogenetic role of locus fpv140 ( P35 ) in comparison with the more-conserved P4b<ORGANIZATION> and DNA<ORGANIZATION> polymerase genes.
