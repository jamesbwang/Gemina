 To the best of our knowledge, only two studies analyzed the relationship between HRV<ORGANIZATION> and carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA<ORGANIZATION> ) in colon cancer patients. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the autonomic activity of colon cancer patients using heart rate variability ( HRV<ORGANIZATION> ) and blood pressure variability ( BPV<ORGANIZATION> ) measures, and to verify if HRV<ORGANIZATION> and BPV<ORGANIZATION> parameters correlate with hemodynamic indices in this group ( â€¦ ) and the plasma levels of CEA<ORGANIZATION>. Presence of colon cancer is associated with changes in autonomic activity, namely parasympathetic-sympathetic imbalance in form of sympathetic overdrive. Cancer-related autonomic dysfunction may contribute to impairment of gastrointestinal motility.
