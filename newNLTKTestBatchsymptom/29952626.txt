 Evidence<GPE> suggests that experiencing financial insecurity lowers well-being and increases problematic financial behaviors. The present article employs a self-determination theory ( SDT<ORGANIZATION> ; R. M. Ryan & Deci<PERSON>, 2000a ) perspective to understand the mechanisms by which experiencing financial insecurity contributes to these detrimental outcomes. Informed by SDT<ORGANIZATION>, we expected that the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness would drive these effects. Studies were concerned with individuals ' general experiences of financial insecurity ( using community samples ; Studies 1 and 2 ), and employed manipulations involving self-reflection ( Study 3 ) and hypothetical scenarios ( Study 4 ). Findings demonstrated that financially insecure conditions undermined basic psychological needs and lowered well-being ( measured in terms of self-esteem, depression, and anxiety ). In addition, lower satisfaction of basic psychological needs linked financial insecurity to a greater likelihood of engaging in financial cheating ( Studies 2 and 3 ) and risky financial decisions ( Study 4 ). Importantly, this pattern of effects remained in evidence across socioeconomically diverse samples and income levels. We discuss implications for future interventions to improve the wellness of individuals in financially insecure circumstances. ( PsycINFO Database Record<ORGANIZATION>
