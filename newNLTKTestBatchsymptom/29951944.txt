 Abnormalities of MITO<ORGANIZATION> dynamics occur in HF and have been implicated in disease progression. This study describes the broad range abnormalities of mitochondrial ( MITO<ORGANIZATION> ) dynamics in Heart<GPE> Failure with reduced ejection fraction ( HF ) and evaluates the effects of long-term therapy with elamipretide ( ELAM<ORGANIZATION> ), a MITO-targeting peptide, on these abnormalities. Studies were performed in left ventricular tissue from dogs and humans with HF<ORGANIZATION>, and were compared with tissue from healthy dogs and healthy donor human hearts. Dogs with HF<ORGANIZATION> were randomized to 3 months therapy with ELAM<ORGANIZATION> or vehicle. The following were evaluated in dog and human hearts: ( 1 ) regulators of MITO<ORGANIZATION> biogenesis, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS<ORGANIZATION> ), cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP<ORGANIZATION> ), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α ( PGC-1α, a transcription factor that drives MITO<ORGANIZATION> biogenesis ) ; ( 2 ) regulators of MITO<ORGANIZATION> fission and fusion, including fission-1, dynamin-related protein-1, mitofusion-2, dominant optic atrophy-1, and mitofilin ; and ( 3 ) determinants of cardiolipin ( CL ) synthesis and remodeling, including CL<ORGANIZATION> synthase-1, tafazzin-1, and acyl-CoA: lysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1. The study showed decreased levels of eNOS<ORGANIZATION>, cGMP<ORGANIZATION>, and PGC-1α in HF<GPE> ( dog and human ). Increased levels of fission-associated proteins, decreased levels of fusion-associated proteins, decreased mitofilin, and abnormalities of CL<ORGANIZATION> synthesis and remodeling were also observed. In all instances, these maladaptations were normalized following long-term therapy with ELAM<ORGANIZATION>. Critical abnormalities of MITO<ORGANIZATION> dynamics occur in HF and are normalized following long-term therapy with ELAM<ORGANIZATION>. The findings provide support for the continued development of ELAM<ORGANIZATION> for the treatment of HF<ORGANIZATION>.
