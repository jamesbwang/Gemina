U.S.<GPE> Army Physical Demands<ORGANIZATION> Study: Differences in physical fitness and occupational task performance between trainees and active duty soldiers. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X ): 000-000, 2018-U.S. Army<ORGANIZATION> initial entry training ( IET<ORGANIZATION> ) is designed to prepare trainees for the military environment and subsequent training, including specific programs to increase physical fitness to perform job-specific tasks to the minimal acceptable performance standard ( MAPS<ORGANIZATION> ). The aim of this study was to compare physical fitness and occupational task performance of trainees at the end of IET<ORGANIZATION> to that of active duty soldiers. One hundred seventy-nine male combat arms trainees at the end of IET<ORGANIZATION> and 337 male combat arms active duty soldiers performed a sandbag carry ( SBC<ORGANIZATION> ), casualty drag ( CD ), and move under direct fire ( MUF<ORGANIZATION> ). Physical fitness was assessed using Army Physical Fitness Test<ORGANIZATION> scores. A questionnaire was administered to determine frequency of task performance. Active duty soldiers compared with trainees were older ( p < 0.01 ) and performed more push-ups ( p < 0.01 ) and sit-ups ( p < 0.01 ). Trainees<PERSON> performed the 2-mile run faster ( p < 0.01 ). Ninety-four percent of trainees and 99 % of active duty soldiers performed the 3 tasks to the MAPSs<ORGANIZATION>. Active duty soldiers performed significantly faster on both the SBC<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.01 ) and CD ( p < 0.01 ) and reported a higher task frequency on the SBC<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.03 ) and CD ( p < 0.01 ). No difference in MUF<ORGANIZATION> performance ( p = 0.16 ) and task frequency ( p = 0.13 ) was detected. Initial entry training seems to provide sufficient physical training as most trainees were able to meet the MAPSs<ORGANIZATION> ; however, performance differences were still apparent between trainees and active duty soldiers. Additional practice performing the physically demanding tasks may help maximize performance on the physically demanding job requirements.
