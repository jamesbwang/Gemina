 Vitamin<PERSON> D deficiency has become one of the most prevalent health problems in modern society. However, there has been no study that has reported the trend of vitamin D status in Asia<GPE>. We performed an observational study to investigate the trend of vitamin D status in South Korea<GPE> based on a representative national database acquired from the Korea National Health<ORGANIZATION> and Nutrition Examination Surveys<ORGANIZATION> ( KNHANES<ORGANIZATION> ) conducted from 2008 to 2014. A total of 39,759 patients were included in the final analyses. Serum<PERSON> 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The overall mean serum level of 25 ( OH ) D<PERSON> was 45.7 nmol/L in males and 40.9 nmol/L in females in KNHANES<ORGANIZATION> 2008 to 2014. There was a significant trend toward lower serum 25 ( OH ) D levels from 2008 to 2014 in males by -1.2 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -1.5 to -0.9 ) nmol/L per year and in female by -0.7 ( 95 % CI -0.9 to -0.4 ) nmol/L per year. The overall mean serum level of 25 ( OH ) D in 2008 was 53.0 nmol/L in males and 45.7 nmol/L in females. It decreased to 43.2 nmol/L in males and 39.2 nmol/L in females in 2014. Vitamin D<PERSON> deficiency, defined as the serum 25 ( OH ) D level of < 50 nmol/L, was found in 65.7 % of males and 76.7 % of females in overall population. A significant increasing trend of vitamin D deficiency was also observed. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in 2008 was 51.8 % in males and 68.2 % in females, but rose to 75.2 % and 82.5 %, respectively, in 2014. The present study demonstrated that vitamin D status in South Koreans<GPE> is still deteriorating. More extensive and proactive measures are needed to improve vitamin D status in South Korea<GPE>.
