 Despite the growing number of octogenarians, little is known about their vitamin D status and activities of daily living ( ADL<ORGANIZATION> ) relations. The aim of this study was to investigate peculiarities of vitamin D and ADL<ORGANIZATION> and to assess their relations in octogenarians. A cross-sectional study was performed at the National Osteoporosis Centre<ORGANIZATION> located in Vilnius<GPE>, Lithuania<GPE>. Community-dwelling ambulatory persons aged ≥80 years were included. Current users of vitamin D supplements were excluded. Total 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentration in serum was measured with Cobas E411<PERSON>. Functional status was assessed by Katz ADL<PERSON> and the Lawton Instrumental Activities<ORGANIZATION> of Daily Living<PERSON> ( IADL<ORGANIZATION> ) scales. Subjects were divided into three groups according to age and into two groups according to vitamin D level. One-way analysis of variance with The study was performed on 153 octogenarians: 81 ( 52.9 % ) women and 72 ( 47.1 % ) men. The average age of subjects was 83.9 ± 3.2 years. Mean total 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 11.2 ± 7.0 ng/ml ; 137 ( 89.5 % ) persons had vitamin D deficiency, 12 ( 7.8 % ) had insufficiency, and only 4 ( 2.6 % ) persons were vitamin D sufficient. Positive weak correlation between total 25 hydroxyvitamin D and ADL<ORGANIZATION> score ( The majority of investigated octogenarians had vitamin D deficiency. The level of vitamin D<PERSON> was associated with the ADL<ORGANIZATION> score. There was no association between the vitamin D level and the IADL<ORGANIZATION> score, although a weak correlation was found between vitamin D level and category of food preparation.
