 Although important information is available on the molecular mechanisms of long-term memory formation, little is known about the processes underlying memory persistence in the brain. Here, we report that persistent gene expression of CaMKIIδ<ORGANIZATION> isoform participates in object recognition long-lasting memory storage in mice hippocampus. We found that CaMKIIδ<ORGANIZATION> mRNA expression was sustained up to one week after training and paralleled memory retention. Antisense DNA<PERSON> infusion in the hippocampus during consolidation or even after consolidation impairs 7-day- but not 1-day-long memory, supporting a role of CaMKIIδ<ORGANIZATION> in memory persistence. CaMKIIδ<ORGANIZATION> gene expression was accompanied by long-lasting nucleosome occupancy changes at its promoter. This epigenetic mechanism is described for the first time in a memory process and offers a novel mechanism for persistent gene expression in neurons. CaMKIIδ<ORGANIZATION> protein is mainly present in nucleus and presynaptic terminals, suggesting a role in these subcellular compartments for memory persistence. All these results point to a key function of the sustained gene expression of this overlooked CaMKII<ORGANIZATION> isoform in long-lasting memories.
