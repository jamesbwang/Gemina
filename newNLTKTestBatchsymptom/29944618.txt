 Despite waning indications in the general population for preoperative autologous blood donation ( PABD<ORGANIZATION> ), it is a procedure that continues to be offered to healthy living liver donors ( LLD<ORGANIZATION> ). In this study we sought to understand the impact of PABD<ORGANIZATION> on the LLD<ORGANIZATION> population. We retrospectively reviewed charts of one institution 's LLDs<ORGANIZATION> over a 2-year period. Per<PERSON> institutional protocol, all accepted LLD<ORGANIZATION> donated 1 unit of autologous blood prior to living donor hepatectomy ( LDH<ORGANIZATION> ). Sixty-six LLDs<ORGANIZATION> underwent PABD<ORGANIZATION> and 59 of these donors underwent LDH<ORGANIZATION>. In this cohort, there was a significant 1.2 g/dL drop in HB from baseline ( prior to PABD<ORGANIZATION> ) to the evening before surgery. Mean<GPE> ( SD ) procedure estimated blood loss was 260 mL ( ±100 ), mean ( SD ) resected graft weight was 592 g ( ±174 ). No allogeneic blood was transfused. 42 % of LLD<ORGANIZATION> received autologous transfusion. Mean<GPE> ( SD ) pretransfusion HB of transfused LLDs<ORGANIZATION> was 11.7 g/dL ( ± 1.2 ). All LLDs<ORGANIZATION> had negative antibody screens. 63 % of donated autologous units were discarded. PABD in our population is associated with decreased preoperative HB, increased exposure of healthy LLD<ORGANIZATION> to unnecessary transfusion-related risks, and high rates of discarded blood product. We encourage further investigation and reconsideration of the practice of PABD<ORGANIZATION> and autologous transfusion in LLDs<ORGANIZATION>.
