 Brain-computer interface ( BCI<ORGANIZATION> ) applications such as keyboard control and vehicular navigation present significant assistive merit for disabled individuals. However, there are limitations associated with BCI<ORGANIZATION> paradigms which restrict a wider adoption of BCI<ORGANIZATION> technology. For example, rapid serial visual presentation ( RSVP<ORGANIZATION> ) paradigms can induce seizures in photosensitive epileptic subjects. This paper evaluates the novel mirrored-word reading paradigm ( MWRP<ORGANIZATION> ) for BCI<ORGANIZATION> implementation using an offline experimental study. The offline study obtained an average single-trial classification accuracy of 74.10 %. The results also demonstrate that the use of multiple trials for classification can increase the accuracy as is common with BCIs<ORGANIZATION>. The developed MWRP-based BCI<ORGANIZATION> also utilized a low presentation frequency which averts the possibility of paradigm induced photosensitivity. However, there are multiple avenues for future work. The MWRP<ORGANIZATION> can be implemented in the online format for real-time device control. For example, a vehicular application platform can be used where the word orientation represents directions for travel. The MWRP<ORGANIZATION> can also be investigated across a wider range of stimulus presentation parameters such as timing, color and stimulus size. Such studies can be used to suggest further improvements to the paradigm which can enhance its applicability for online device control.
