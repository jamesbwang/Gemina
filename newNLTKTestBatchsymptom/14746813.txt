 Resolvins are endogenous lipid mediators derived from omega-3 fatty acids. Resolvin E1<PERSON> ( RvE1<ORGANIZATION> ), derived from eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA<ORGANIZATION> ), modulates osteoclasts and immune cells in periodontal disease models. The direct role of RvE1<ORGANIZATION> in bone remodeling is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of RvE1<ORGANIZATION> on bone remodeling under inflammatory conditions. Our working hypothesis is that RvE1<ORGANIZATION> downregulates bone resorption through direct actions on both osteoblast and osteoclast function in inflammatory osteoclastogenesis. A tumor necrosis factor-α induced local calvarial osteolysis model with or without the systemic administration of RvE1<ORGANIZATION> was used. To evaluate osteoclastogenesis and NFκB<ORGANIZATION> signaling pathway activity, murine bone tissue was evaluated by Micro CT<PERSON> ( μCT<ORGANIZATION> ) analysis, TRAP<ORGANIZATION> staining, and immunofluorescence analysis. Mechanistically, to evaluate the direct role of RvE1<ORGANIZATION> impacting bone cells, primary calvarial mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with interleukin ( IL ) -6 ( 10 ng/ml ) and IL-6 receptor ( 10 ng/ml ) and simultaneously incubated with or without RvE1<ORGANIZATION> ( 100 nM ). Expression of receptor activator of NFκB<ORGANIZATION> ligand ( RANKL<ORGANIZATION> ) and osteoprotegerin ( OPG<ORGANIZATION> ) was measured by ELISA<ORGANIZATION>. RNA sequencing ( RNA-Seq ) and differential expression analysis was performed to determine signaling pathways impacted by RvE1<ORGANIZATION>. The systemic administration of RvE1<ORGANIZATION> reduced calvarial bone resorption as determined by µCT<ORGANIZATION>. Histologic analysis of calvaria revealed that osteoclastogenesis was reduced as determined by number and size of osteoclasts in TRAP-stained sections (
