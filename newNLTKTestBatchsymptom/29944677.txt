 Population-based data on prevalence, causes of blindness and extent of ophthalmological coverage is required for efficient implementation and evaluation of ocular health programs. In view of the scarcity of prevalence data for visual impairment and blindness in Malaysia<GPE>, this study aims to estimate the prevalence and causes of visual impairment ( VI ) in the elderly, using Rapid Assessment<PERSON> of Avoidable Blindness<ORGANIZATION> ( RAAB<ORGANIZATION> ) survey technique. Malaysia<PERSON> was divided into six regions, with each region consisting of 50 clusters. Multistage cluster sampling method was used and each cluster contained 50 residents aged 50 years and above. Eligible subjects were interviewed and pertinent demographic details, barriers to cataract surgery, medical and ocular history was noted. Subjects<PERSON> had visual acuity assessment with tumbling 'E ' Snellen optotypes and ocular examination with direct ophthalmoscope. The primary cause of VI<ORGANIZATION> was documented. Results were calculated for individual zones and weighted average was used to obtain overall prevalence for the country. Inter-regional and overall prevalence for blindness, severe VI and moderate VI were determined. Causes of VI<ORGANIZATION>, cataract surgical coverage and barriers to cataract surgery were assessed. A total of 15,000 subjects were examined with a response rate of 95.3 %. The age and gender-adjusted prevalence of blindness, severe visual impairment and moderate visual impairment were 1.2 % ( 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.0-1.4 % ), 1.0 % ( 95 % CI: 0.8-1.2 % ) and 5.9 % ( 5.3-6.5 % ) respectively. Untreated cataract ( 58.6 % ), diabetic retinopathy ( 10.4 % ) and glaucoma ( 6.6 % ) were the commonest causes of blindness. Overall, 86.3 % of the causes of blindness were avoidable. Cataract<PERSON> surgical coverage ( CSC<ORGANIZATION> ) in persons for blindness, severe visual impairment and moderate visual impairment was 90 %, 86 % and 66 % respectively. Increased patient education and further expansion of ophthalmological services are required to reduce avoidable blindness even further in Malaysia<GPE>.
