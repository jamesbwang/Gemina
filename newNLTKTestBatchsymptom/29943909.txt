 Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy ( MIDP<ORGANIZATION> ) has gained in popularity recently. However, the consensus whether to preserve the spleen or not remains inconsistent. In this study, we compared MIDP<ORGANIZATION> outcomes between spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy ( SPDP<ORGANIZATION> ) and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy ( DPS<ORGANIZATION> ) ; as well as outcomes between splenic vessel preservation ( SVP<ORGANIZATION> ) and Warshaw<PERSON> 's technique ( WT ). A systematic search of PubMed<GPE> ( MEDLINE<ORGANIZATION> ) and Cochrane Library<PERSON> was conducted and the reference lists of review articles were hand-searched. Fifteen<PERSON> relevant studies with 769 patients were selected for meta-analyses of DPS<ORGANIZATION> and SPDP<ORGANIZATION> ; while another 15 studies with 841 patients were used for the analysis between SVP<ORGANIZATION> and WT<ORGANIZATION>. Compared with the DPS<ORGANIZATION> group, SPDP<ORGANIZATION> patients had significantly lower incidences of infectious complications ( P<PERSON> = 0.006 ) and pancreatic fistula ( P<PERSON> = 0.002 ), shorter operative time ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) and less blood loss ( P<PERSON> = 0.01 ). Compared with WT<ORGANIZATION>, SVP<ORGANIZATION> patients had significantly lower incidences of splenic infarction ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) and secondary splenectomy ( P<PERSON> = 0.003 ). Sub-analysis for laparoscopic surgery alone had similar results. Based on this study, SPDP<ORGANIZATION> has significantly superior outcomes compared to DPS<ORGANIZATION>. When a spleen is preserved, SVP<ORGANIZATION> has better outcomes over WT<ORGANIZATION> for reducing splenic complications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
