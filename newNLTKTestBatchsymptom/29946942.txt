 Conventionally, colonic stents are inserted with a retrograde trans-anal approach-however, stenting of right-sided or proximal transverse colon lesions may pose a challenge due to tortuosity or long distances. We report three successful cases of percutaneous antegrade colonic stenting in patients using a proximal trans-peritoneal colopexy technique. Three patients underwent a proximal trans-peritoneal colopexy technique for antegrade colonic stent placement. The patients included three males, ages 89, 92 and 55, who were unsuitable for conventional methods. All patients had a colopexy with the aid of three gastropexy sutures performed under CT or fluoroscopic guidance and subsequent colonic access, followed by the crossing lesion and subsequent deployment of an uncovered colonic stent. A 10-Fr pigtail catheter was exchanged for the sheath, capped and left in place along with the colopexy suture anchors. Percutaneous antegrade colonic stent placement was technically successful in all patients with no complications. Follow-up at 10 days, a tubogram confirmed stent patency. The pigtail drain and suture anchors were subsequently removed. Antegrade<PERSON> colonic stenting with the use of a three point colopexy is a straightforward well-tolerated procedure and is a useful technique in a cohort of patients in whom conventional stenting has failed/is unsuitable. Additionally, we believe we have reported the first two cases involving transverse colon access for stenting.
