 Pathogen<PERSON> or diet-induced immune activation can partition energy and nutrients away from growth, but clear relationships between immune responses and the direction and magnitude of energy partitioning responses have yet to be elucidated. The objectives were to determine how β-mannanase supplementation and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION> ) immune stimulation affect maintenance energy requirements ( MEm<ORGANIZATION> ) and to characterize immune parameters, digestibility, growth performance, and energy balance. In a randomized complete block design, 30 young weaned pigs were assigned to either the control treatment ( CON<ORGANIZATION> ; basal corn, soybean meal and soybean hulls diet ), the enzyme treatment ( ENZ<ORGANIZATION> ; basal diet + 0.056 % β-mannanase ), or the immune system stimulation treatment ( ISS<ORGANIZATION> ; basal diet + 0.056 % β-mannanase, challenged with repeated increasing doses of Beta-mannanase supplementation did not affect immune status, nutrient digestibility, growth performance, energy balance, or ME This experiment provides novel data on β-mannanase supplementation effects on immune parameters and energy balance in pigs and is the first to directly relate decreased ADG<ORGANIZATION> to increased ME
