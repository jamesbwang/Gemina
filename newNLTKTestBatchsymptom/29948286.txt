 Oral anticoagulation therapy in individuals with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) reduces the risk of thromboembolic events at cost of an increased bleeding risk. Whether anticoagulation-related outcomes differ between patients with paroxysmal and sustained AF receiving anticoagulation is controversially discussed. In the present analysis of the prospective multi-center cohort study thrombEVAL<ORGANIZATION>, the incidence of anticoagulation-related adverse events was analyzed according to the AF<ORGANIZATION> phenotype. Information on outcome was centrally recorded over 3 years, validated via medical records and adjudicated by an independent review panel. Study<PERSON> monitoring was provided by an independent institution. Overall, the sample comprised 1089 AF individuals, of whom n = 398 had paroxysmal AF and n = 691 experienced sustained AF. In Cox<GPE> regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders, sustained AF<ORGANIZATION> indicated an independently elevated risk of clinically relevant bleeding compared to paroxysmal AF<ORGANIZATION> [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 1.40 ( 1.02 ; 1.93 ) ; P<PERSON> = 0.038 ]. For clinically relevant bleeding, a significant interaction of the pattern of AF<ORGANIZATION> type with concomitant heart failure ( HF ) was detected: HR In HF patients receiving oral anticoagulation, sustained AF<ORGANIZATION> indicates a substantially elevated risk of bleeding. https: //clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT01809015.
