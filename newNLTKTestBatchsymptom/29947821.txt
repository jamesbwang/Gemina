 To investigate the inequality in medical care utilization and household catastrophic health spending ( HCHS<ORGANIZATION> ) between the poverty and non-poverty residents in rural Rwanda<ORGANIZATION> and their links with community-based health insurance ( Mutuelles<ORGANIZATION> ). We used the 2005 and 2010 nationally representative Integrated Living Conditions Surveys<ORGANIZATION>. We estimated multilevel logistic regression models to obtain the adjusted levels and trends of both absolute and relative inequalities and examined associations between Mutuelles<PERSON> status and these inequalities. Significant inequality between the two income groups, in both absolute and relative measures of medical care utilization and HCHS<ORGANIZATION> remained unchanged in 2005 and 2010. Significant reduction in adjusted absolute inequality in percentage of HCHS<ORGANIZATION> between the two years was not associated with Mutuelles<PERSON> status. While Mutuelles<PERSON> promoted medical care utilization and reduced HCHS<ORGANIZATION>, it did not play a significant role in reducing their inequalities by poverty status between 2005 and 2010. Future studies should assess the impact of additional strategies ( e.g., the exemption of Mutuelles<GPE> premiums and copayments for households living in poverty ), on reducing inequality by poverty status.
