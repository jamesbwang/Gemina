 Endosomes have emerged as a central hub and pathogenic driver of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ). The earliest brain cytopathology in neurodegeneration, occurring decades before amyloid plaques and cognitive decline, is an expansion in the size and number of endosomal compartments. The strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E<PERSON> ( ApoE4<ORGANIZATION> ). Previous studies have shown that ApoE4<ORGANIZATION> potentiates presymptomatic endosomal dysfunction and defective endocytic clearance of amyloid beta ( Aβ ), although how these two pathways are linked at a cellular and mechanistic level has been unclear. Here, we show that aberrant endosomal acidification in ApoE4<ORGANIZATION> astrocytes traps the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein ( LRP1<ORGANIZATION> ) within intracellular compartments, leading to loss of surface expression and Aβ clearance. Pathological endosome acidification is caused by ε4 risk allele-selective down-regulation of the Na
