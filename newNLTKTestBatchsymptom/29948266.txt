 Chronic<GPE> rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps ( CRSwNP<ORGANIZATION> ) affects approximately 4 % of general population. Patients with CRSwNP<ORGANIZATION> have greater burden of CRS<ORGANIZATION> symptoms and higher rate of relapse after either medical or surgical treatments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between polypoid change of anterior free border of middle turbinate and rate of relapse in patients with CRSwNP<ORGANIZATION>. A controlled prospective cohort study was performed. Seventy-seven adult patients with CRSwNP<ORGANIZATION> in whom their MT polypoid change was proved and 77 patients without MT<ORGANIZATION> polypoid change were recruited. Allergy<PERSON>, asthma, aspirin hypersensitivity, Lund Kennedy<PERSON> and Lund Mackay<PERSON> scores and eosinophilic scores of polyp and middle turbinate were recorded. Patient<PERSON> 's health-related quality of life was assessed using the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-22 ) questionnaire. All patients were evaluated 12 months after ESS<ORGANIZATION>. Polyp relapse, Lund Kennedy<PERSON> scores and SNOT-22 scores were documented. The relapse rate in patients with MT polypoid change was significantly higher than the control group ( 37.14 vs. 20.58, p value = 0.03 ). Eosinophil<PERSON> score of nasal polyps and MT<ORGANIZATION> specimens were significantly higher in patients with MT<ORGANIZATION> polypoid change than patients without polypoid change. The postoperative Lund Kennedy<PERSON> and SNOT-22 scores in patients with MT polypoid change were significantly higher than the control group. This study showed a significant association between polypoid change of anterior free border of middle turbinate and nasal polyp relapse. This new and simple criterion of severity of CRSwNP<ORGANIZATION> could have clinical implications.
