 Evidence<GPE> regarding potential adverse neuropsychiatric effects of efavirenz is conflicting, and data from sub-Saharan Africa<PERSON>, where 70 % of persons living with HIV<ORGANIZATION> ( PLHIV<ORGANIZATION> ) reside and efavirenz is used as first-line therapy, are limited. To estimate associations between efavirenz use and depression and suicidal ideation among PLHIV<ORGANIZATION> in Uganda<GSP>. Prospective observational cohort study. ( ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01596322 ). Mbarara<PERSON>, Uganda<GSP>. Adult PLHIV<PERSON> enrolled at the start of antiretroviral therapy ( ART<ORGANIZATION> ) and observed every 3 to 4 months from 2005 to 2015. The exposure of interest was time-varying efavirenz use, defined as use during the 7 days and in 60 or more of the 90 days before a study visit, compared with nevirapine use. Self-reported outcomes were depression, defined as a mean score greater than 1.75 on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist<ORGANIZATION> depression subscale, and suicidal ideation. Multivariable-adjusted generalized estimating equations ( GEE<ORGANIZATION> ) logistic regression, Cox<PERSON> proportional hazards regression, and marginal structural models were fit to estimate the association between efavirenz use and the risk for depression and suicidal ideation. 694 participants ( median age, 33 years ; median pretreatment CD4+ count, 1.8 Ã— 109 cells/L ) contributed 1200 person-years of observation ( 460 person-years receiving efavirenz ). No baseline differences in depression or suicidal ideation were found between patients ever exposed to efavirenz and those never exposed to efavirenz and receiving nevirapine ( P > 0.80 for both ). Of 305 participants ever-exposed to efavirenz, 61 ( 20.0 % ) and 19 ( 6.2 % ) had depression and suicidal ideation, respectively, on at least 1 follow-up visit, compared with 125 ( 32.1 % ) and 47 ( 12.1 % ) of the 389 who received nevirapine. In adjusted GEE<ORGANIZATION> models, efavirenz use was associated with decreased odds of depression compared with nevirapine use ( adjusted odds ratio, 0.62 [ 95 % CI, 0.40 to 0.96 ] ) and was not significantly associated with suicidal ideation ( adjusted odds ratio, 0.61 [ CI, 0.30 to 1.25 ] ). Time-to-event and marginal structural models yielded similar estimates. Nonrandom<PERSON> assignment to treatment and substantial differences between the efavirenz and nevirapine groups. No evidence was found that use of efavirenz in first-line ART<ORGANIZATION> increased the risk for depression or suicidal ideation compared with nevirapine use among PLHIV<ORGANIZATION> in Uganda<GSP>.
