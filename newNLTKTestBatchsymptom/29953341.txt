 To evaluate, in vitro, the effect of mouth rinse exposure on bleached enamel. Enamel/dentin bovine blocks ( 4×4×2 mm ) were bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide ( HP ) and were submitted to immersion twice daily for 14 days with different rinses ( n=10 ), including those involving: distilled water ( C [ control ] ), 225-ppm NaF<ORGANIZATION> ( FM<ORGANIZATION>, Colgate Plax<ORGANIZATION> Classic ), essential oil ( EM<ORGANIZATION>, Listerine Tartar Control<PERSON> ), 1.5 % hydrogen peroxide ( HPM<ORGANIZATION>, Colgate Plax<ORGANIZATION> Whitening ), and 2 % hydrogen peroxide, pyrophosphates, and 225-ppm NaF<ORGANIZATION> ( HPM+P, Colgate® Luminous White ). The specimens were stored in a remineralizing solution during all experiments. Analyses of color ( ΔE, L*, a*, b* ) and roughness ( Ra ) were performed at the baseline, after HP<ORGANIZATION>, and after exposure to the rinse. The cross-sectional microhardness ( CSMH<ORGANIZATION> ) and images by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM<ORGANIZATION> ) were assessed at the end. The data were subjected to analysis of variance ( ANOVA<ORGANIZATION> ) ( ΔE ), repeated measures ANOVA<ORGANIZATION> ( Ra ), and split-plot ANOVA ( CSMH<ORGANIZATION> ), followed by the Tukey<GPE> test. The L*, a*, and b* values were analyzed by generalized linear models ( α=0.05 ). Color changes were not statistically different in the groups. Ra<PERSON> increased in all groups after bleaching ; however, it was reestablished in C<GPE>, FM<ORGANIZATION>, and HPM+F and increased in EM after 14 days of the rinse. EM and HPM<ORGANIZATION> reduced the CSMH<ORGANIZATION> values differing from C and promoted alterations on the enamel surface visualized by SEM<ORGANIZATION>. The mouth rinses did not affect the whitening efficacy or promote benefits on bleached enamel properties. Moreover, the 1.5 % hydrogen peroxide- or essential oil-based mouth rinses affected the bleached enamel properties, promoting an alteration in morphologic surface and mineral loss in depth.
