 This study examined the construct validity of the McLean<ORGANIZATION> Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder<PERSON> ( MSI-BPD ) in a consecutive sample of adult psychiatric patients ( n = 128 ) and a separate sample of undergraduate students ( n = 289 ) in Singapore<GPE>. Participants were administered the MSI-BPD and other measures assessing related symptoms of BPD<ORGANIZATION>. Patients were also administered a semistructured interview by interviewers blind to their MSI-BPD scores. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed a unique three-factor solution, consisting of affect dysregulation, self-disturbances, and behavioral and interpersonal dysregulation. In both samples, the MSI-BPD demonstrated good internal consistency and convergent validity. The measure also showed good discriminant validity and predictive accuracy ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> = .82 ), with an optimal cut-off score of 7.5. Overall, the findings suggest that BPD<ORGANIZATION> is a valid and coherent clinical construct in Singapore<GPE>, and point to the need to further clarify the presentation and etiology of BPD<ORGANIZATION> in this cultural context.
