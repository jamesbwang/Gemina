 SWOG<ORGANIZATION> S0421<PERSON> was a large randomized trial comparing docetaxel/prednisone plus placebo ( DPP<ORGANIZATION> ) to docetaxel/prednisone plus atrasentan over 12 cycles for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC<ORGANIZATION> ). The current report presents the PRO<ORGANIZATION> results for this trial, an important secondary endpoint. The trial specified two primary PRO endpoints. Palliation of worst pain was based on the Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI<ORGANIZATION> ), where a 2 point difference is defined as clinically meaningful. Improvement of functional status was based on the Functional Assessment<ORGANIZATION> of Cancer<GPE> Therapy - Prostate Cancer Trial Outcome Index<ORGANIZATION> ( FACT-P TOI ) ; a 5-point difference has been defined as clinically meaningful. We compared rates by arm using chi-square tests. Longitudinal analyses using linear mixed models addressed changes by arm over time. Four-hundred eighty-nine patients on each arm were evaluable for PRO<ORGANIZATION> endpoint data. There were no differences by arm in clinically meaningful pain palliation ( 41.7 % for DPP<ORGANIZATION> vs. 44.0 % for DPA<ORGANIZATION>, The SWOG S0421<ORGANIZATION> PRO data showed little evidence of clinically meaningful differences by arm in either pain palliation or functional status.
