 Morbid<GPE> obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States<GPE> and constitutes a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Bariatric<PERSON> surgery represents a viable and effective means of weight loss. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band placement is the most commonly used and least invasive bariatric surgical technique. Although the complication rate is low, various complications have been described, including erosion of the gastric band into the stomach. The authors present a case of laparoscopic adjustable gastric band erosion, where both the band and the tubing eroded into the stomach and colon, and the tubing further eroded out of and back into the colon several times.
