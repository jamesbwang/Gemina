 To discuss the association of the T786C<ORGANIZATION> and G894T<GPE> polymorphisms of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS<ORGANIZATION> ) with the occurrence and prognosis of aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH<ORGANIZATION> ). One hundred sixty-nine patients with aSAH<ORGANIZATION> were collected as the case group, which was divided into the good prognosis group and adverse prognosis group according to the condition 3 months after the treatment. One hundred fifty-six healthy volunteers were collected as the control group. The allele and genotype of T786C<GPE> and G894T<GPE> polymorphisms of eNOS<ORGANIZATION> were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ). The genotype and allele frequency of eNOS<ORGANIZATION> were compared between different groups. And then, the risk factors of aSAH<ORGANIZATION> occurrence and prognosis were analyzed by using the logistic regression model. Both the genotype and allele frequency distributions of T786C<GPE> and G894T<PERSON> between the case group and control group were significantly different ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). There were significant differences in the distribution of G894T<GPE> and T786C<PERSON> allele frequency and G894T<GPE> genotype between the good prognosis group and adverse prognosis group, and there was no difference in T786C<GPE> genotype. The results of the logistic regression analysis indicated that T786C<PERSON> and G894T<GPE> polymorphisms of eNOS<ORGANIZATION> were independent influencing factors on the occurrence of aSAH<ORGANIZATION> and the G894T<GPE> polymorphism was also closely related to the prognosis. T786C<PERSON> and G894T<GPE> polymorphisms of eNOS<ORGANIZATION> gene were correlated with the occurrence and prognosis of aSAH<ORGANIZATION>, and the G894T<GPE> polymorphism might be an independent influencing factor.
