 Inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancers ( IBD-CRCs ) are associated with a higher mortality than sporadic colorectal cancers. The poorly defined molecular pathogenesis of IBD-CRCs limits development of effective prevention, detection and treatment strategies. We aimed to identify biomarkers using whole exome sequencing of IBD-CRCs to guide individualised management. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 34 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary IBD-CRCs and 31 matched normal lymph nodes. Computational methods were used to identify somatic point mutations, small insertions and deletions, mutational signatures, and somatic copy number alterations. Mismatch<PERSON> repair status was examined. Hypermutation<PERSON> was observed in 27 % of IBD-CRCs. All<PERSON> hypermutated cancers were from the proximal colon ; all but 1 of the cancers with hypermutation had defective mismatch repair or somatic mutations in the proofreading domain of DNA<ORGANIZATION> IBD-CRCs should be evaluated for hypermutation and defective mismatch repair to identify patients with a higher neo-epitope load who may benefit from immunotherapies. Prospective trials are required to determine whether immunohistochemistry to detect loss of MLH1<ORGANIZATION> expression in dysplastic colonic tissue could identify patients at increased risk of developing IBD-CRC. We identified mutations in genes in IBD-CRCs with hypermutation that might be targeted therapeutically. These approaches would complement and individualise surveillance and treatment programmes.
