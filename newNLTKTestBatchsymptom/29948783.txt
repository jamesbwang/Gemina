 This study aims to identify perceived impacts of Health Impact Assessment<PERSON> ( HIA<ORGANIZATION> ) on decision-making, determinants of health, and determinants of health equity and outline the mechanisms through which these impacts can occur. The research team conducted a mixed-methods study of HIAs<ORGANIZATION> in the USA<ORGANIZATION>. First, investigators collected data regarding perceived HIA<ORGANIZATION> impacts through an online questionnaire, which was completed by 149 stakeholders representing 126 unique HIAs<ORGANIZATION>. To explore in greater depth the themes that arose from the online survey, investigators conducted semi-structured interviews with 46 stakeholders involved with 27 HIAs related to the built environment. This preliminary study suggests that HIAs<ORGANIZATION> can strengthen relationships and build trust between community and government institutions. In addition, this study suggests that HIA<ORGANIZATION> recommendations can inform policy and decision-making systems that determine the distribution of health-promoting resources and health risks. HIA<ORGANIZATION> outcomes may in turn lead to more equitable access to health resources and reduce exposure to environmental harms among at-risk populations. Future<PERSON> research should further explore associations between HIAs<ORGANIZATION> and changes in determinants of health and health equity by corroborating findings with other data sources and documenting potential impacts and outcomes of HIAs<ORGANIZATION> in other sectors.
