 Colorectal<GPE> cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. It frequently occurs at the junction of the rectum and sigmoid colon. It is characterized by high mortality and poor prognosis. Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death ( BIM<ORGANIZATION> ) plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and involves in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. The transcription factor forkhead, transcription factor O subfamily 3a ( FoxO3a<ORGANIZATION> ) plays a role in the regulation of BIM<ORGANIZATION> expression and is associated to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that there is a targeted relationship between FoxO3a<ORGANIZATION> and microRNA-223 ( miR-223 ). This study aims to investigate effects of miR-223 on the regulation of FoxO3a/BIM signaling pathway and colorectal cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. Colorectal<ORGANIZATION> cancer cell line SW620<ORGANIZATION> and normal colorectal epithelial cell line NCM460<ORGANIZATION> were cultured in vitro. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the relationship between miR-223 and FoxO3a<ORGANIZATION>. Flow<PERSON> cytometry was adopted to detect apoptosis. EdU<ORGANIZATION> staining was applied to test cell proliferation. Western blot was selected to determine FoxO3a<ORGANIZATION> and BIM<ORGANIZATION> protein expressions. There was targeted regulatory relationship between miR-223 and FoxO3a<ORGANIZATION>. MiRa-223 up-regulated, FoxO3a<ORGANIZATION> and BIM<ORGANIZATION> expressions reduced, and cell proliferation was enhanced in SW620<GPE> cells compared with NCM460<ORGANIZATION> cells. MiR-223 inhibitor or pIRES2-FoxO3a transfection significantly increased FoxO3a<ORGANIZATION> and BIM<ORGANIZATION> expressions, attenuated cell proliferation, and enhanced cell apoptosis. MiR-223 targeted inhibited expression of FoxO3<ORGANIZATION>. Down-regulating the expression of miR-223, it increased the expressions of FoxO3a<ORGANIZATION> and BIM<ORGANIZATION>, weakened SW620<ORGANIZATION> cells proliferation and induced apoptosis.
