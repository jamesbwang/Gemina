 We aimed to quantify the safety and effectiveness of vedolizumab ( VDZ<ORGANIZATION> ) when used for UC<ORGANIZATION>, and to identify predictors of response to treatment. Retrospective review ( May 2014-December 2016 ) of VICTORY Consortium<ORGANIZATION> data. Adults with follow-up after starting VDZ<ORGANIZATION> for clinically active UC were included. Primary effectiveness outcomes were cumulative rates of clinical remission ( resolution of all UC-related symptoms ) and endoscopic remission ( Mayo<ORGANIZATION> endoscopic sub-score 0 ). Key<PERSON> secondary effectiveness outcomes included cumulative rates of corticosteroid-free remission and deep remission ( clinical remission and endoscopic remission ). Cox<PERSON> proportional hazard analyses were used to identify independent predictors of treatment effectiveness. Non-response imputation ( NRI<ORGANIZATION> ) sensitivity analyses were performed for effectiveness outcomes. Key<PERSON> safety outcomes were rates of serious infection, serious adverse events, and colectomy. We included 321 UC patients ( 71 % prior TNFα<ORGANIZATION> antagonist exposure, median follow-up 10 months ). The 12-month cumulative rates of clinical remission and endoscopic remission were 51 % and 41 %, respectively. Corresponding rates for corticosteroid-free remission and deep remission were 37 % and 30 %, respectively. Using NRI<ORGANIZATION>, 12-month rates were 20 % ( n = 64/321 ) for clinical remission, 17 % ( n = 35/203 ) for endoscopic remission, 15 % ( n = 30/195 ) for corticosteroid-free remission, and 14 % ( n = 28/203 ) for deep remission. A majority of the patients without adequate follow-up at 12 months who were deemed non-responders using NRI<ORGANIZATION> had already achieved clinical remission ( n = 70 ) or a significant clinical response ( n = 36 ) prior to 12 months. VDZ<ORGANIZATION> discontinuation prior to 12 months was observed in 91 patients, for lack of response ( n = 56 ), need for surgery ( n = 29 ), or adverse event ( n = 6 ). On multivariable analyses, prior exposure to a TNFα<ORGANIZATION> antagonist was associated with a reduced probability of achieving clinical remission ( HR 0.53, 95 % CI 0.38-0.75 ) and endoscopic remission ( HR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.29-0.88 ). Serious<PERSON> adverse events and serious infections were reported in 6 % and 4 % of patients, respectively. Overall cumulative rates of colectomy over 12 months were 13 %, with lower rates observed in patients naive to TNFα<ORGANIZATION> antagonist therapy ( 2 % ) than those who had been exposed to TNFα<ORGANIZATION> antagonists ( 19 % ). In this large real-world cohort we observed that VDZ<ORGANIZATION> was well tolerated and effective in achieving key clinical outcomes.
