 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA<ORGANIZATION> ) is the leading cause of recurrent infections in humans including endocarditis, pneumonia, and toxic shock syndrome. Novel therapeutics to treat MRSA<ORGANIZATION> and other resistant bacteria are urgently needed. Adjuvant therapy, which uses a non-toxic compound to repotentiate the toxic effects of an existing antibiotic, is an attractive response to the growing resistance crisis. Herein<PERSON> we describe the evaluation of structurally-related, FDA-approved tricyclic amine antidepressants that selectively repotentiate MRSA<ORGANIZATION> to β-lactam antibiotics. Our results identify important structural features of the tricyclic amine class for β-lactam adjuvant activity. Furthermore, we describe the mechanism of action for our lead compound, amoxapine, and illustrate that it represses the mRNA<ORGANIZATION> levels of key β-lactam resistance genes in response to β-lactam treatment. This work is novel in that it highlights an important class of small molecules with the ability to simultaneously inhibit production of both β-lactamase and penicillin-binding protein 2a.
