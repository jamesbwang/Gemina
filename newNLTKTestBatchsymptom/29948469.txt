 The Brief Post-Coma Scale ( BPCS<ORGANIZATION> ) is an easy diagnostic tool for individuals with disorders of consciousness ( DoC<ORGANIZATION> ), in a reduced version from a previously Post-Coma Scale, that could distinguish patients in the minimally conscious state ( MCS<ORGANIZATION> ) from those in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome ( UWS<ORGANIZATION> ), formerly defined as vegetative state ( VS ). Aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic validity of the BPCS<ORGANIZATION> in comparison with the Coma<ORGANIZATION> Recovery Scale-Revised ( CRS-R ), in its Italian<GPE> validated version, the Disability<ORGANIZATION> Rating Scale ( DRS<ORGANIZATION> ), the Level<ORGANIZATION> of Cognitive Functioning<PERSON> ( LCF<ORGANIZATION> ), and the Glasgow Outcome Scale<ORGANIZATION> ( GOS<ORGANIZATION> ). In an Italian<GPE> multicenter study on 545 patients with DoC<ORGANIZATION>, 36 post-acute rehabilitation wards, 32 long-term care centers, and 2 family associations participated to data collection. Statistically significant correlations were found between the BPCS<ORGANIZATION> and the other clinical scales: R = 0.586 ( p < 0.001 ) with LCF<ORGANIZATION>, R<ORGANIZATION> = - 0.566 ( p < 0.001 ) with DRS<ORGANIZATION>, R<ORGANIZATION> = 0.622 ( p < 0.001 ) with CRS-R. The BPCS<ORGANIZATION> scores resulted significantly correlated with the time from acute event ( R<ORGANIZATION> = 0.117, p = 0.006 ). Patients with GOS<ORGANIZATION> score 2 had mean BPCS<ORGANIZATION> of 1.84 ± 1.19, whereas those with GOS<ORGANIZATION> 3 had significantly higher scores 3.88 ± 1.71 ( p < 0.001 ). Similarly, in patients with vegetative state/UWS ( VS/UWS ), the mean BPSC<ORGANIZATION> score was 1.71 ± 1.09, significantly lower ( p < 0.001 ) than that of patients with minimally conscious state ( BPCS<ORGANIZATION> = 3.83 ± 1.29 ). Finally, the agreement of the BPCS<ORGANIZATION> and clinical diagnosis was of 84.4 %, with an odds ratio OR = 3.781 ( 95 % CI = 3.026-4.725, p < 0.001 ). The BPCS<ORGANIZATION> has demonstrated statistically significant correlations with the most commonly used scales in persons with DoC<ORGANIZATION>.
