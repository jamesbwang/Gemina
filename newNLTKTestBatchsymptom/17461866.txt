 Cardiac<GPE> resynchronization therapy ( CRT<ORGANIZATION> ) improves morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Although structural remodelling correlates with improved long-term outcomes, the role of electrical remodelling is poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate electrical remodelling following CRT<ORGANIZATION> using a quadripolar left ventricular ( LV ) lead and to correlate this with structural remodelling. Consecutive patients undergoing initial CRT<ORGANIZATION> implantation using a quadripolar LV lead were enrolled. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Twelve<PERSON> lead ECG<ORGANIZATION>, transthoracic echocardiogram, and evaluation of intracardiac electrograms ( EGM<ORGANIZATION> ) were performed. Measures<PERSON> included right and left ventricular lead intrinsic delay, RV-pacing to LV-sensing ( RVp-LVs ) delay, and LV-pacing to RV-sensing ( LVp-RVs ) delay. The electrical changes were then correlated with echocardiographic response to CRT<ORGANIZATION>, defined by ≥15 % relative reduction in LVESV<ORGANIZATION> and ≥ 5 % absolute improvement in EF on TTE<ORGANIZATION>. Activation sequence was determined using the quadripolar lead. Forty patients were enrolled. Mean intrinsic RV-LV EGM values decreased from 121.9 ± 14.7 ms to 109.1 ± 15.0 ms ( This novel study used EGMs<ORGANIZATION> from a quadripolar LV lead to demonstrate electrical remodelling occurs following CRT<ORGANIZATION>. A nonsignificant trend suggests that electrical remodelling in CRT<ORGANIZATION> is greater in responders compared to nonresponders, although further study is needed.
