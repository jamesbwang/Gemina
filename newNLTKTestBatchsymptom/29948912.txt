 Synchrotron<GPE> radiation X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, in conjunction with atomic absorption and Raman<PERSON> spectroscopy, was used to analyze a set of top brand tattoo inks to investigate the presence of toxic elements and hazardous substances. The Cr, Cu<GPE>, and Pb contents were found to be above the maximum allowed levels established by the Council<ORGANIZATION> of Europe<GPE> through the resolution ResAP ( 2008 ) 1 on requirements and criteria for the safety of tattoos and permanent makeup. Raman<PERSON> analysis has revealed the presence of a set of prohibited substances mentioned in ResAP<GPE> ( 2008 ) 1, among which are the pigments Blue 15, Green 7, and Violet 23. Other pigments that were identified in white, black, red, and yellow inks are the Pigment<ORGANIZATION> White 6, Carbon Black<PERSON>, Pigment Red<PERSON> 8, and a diazo yellow, respectively. The present results show the importance of regulating tattoo ink composition.
