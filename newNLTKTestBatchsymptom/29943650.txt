 Mortality from invasive fungal disease involving the central nervous system ( CNS<ORGANIZATION> ) is excessive. Achieving therapeutic drug concentrations at the site of infection within the CNS<ORGANIZATION> is always difficult and its evaluation is complex due to anatomical barriers and variable pathophysiological lesions. Areas<PERSON> covered: This review provides an updated summary of the CNS<ORGANIZATION> PK of antifungal therapies. It considers factors that influence the success of antifungal regimens for CNS<ORGANIZATION> infection as well as preclinical and clinical data that quantify antifungal pharmacokinetics ( PK ) in the CNS<ORGANIZATION>. Furthermore, it presents state-of-the-art technologies to enhance the clinical use of existing antifungal drugs, and introduces novel antifungal drugs in development. Expert<PERSON> opinion: The antifungal drugs currently available are either suboptimal, or are being used suboptimally, for CNS<ORGANIZATION> disease. Therapeutic drug monitoring is mandatory to enhance their effectiveness. Novel drugs in development may offer more efficacious options. In all cases, contemporary technologies to assess CNS<ORGANIZATION> PK offer the opportunity to enhance our understanding and use of antifungal drugs for CNS<ORGANIZATION> fungal disease.
