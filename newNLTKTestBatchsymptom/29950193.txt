 SummaryThe<ORGANIZATION> effects of adding fulvic acids ( FAs<ORGANIZATION> ) to semen extenders on the quality parameters of frozen-thawed goat buck spermatozoa remain undetermined. Buck<PERSON> semen samples collected from six mature goat bucks once a week were diluted with Tris-egg yolk-based extenders. The diluted semen samples were supplemented with FAs<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 %, w/w ), cryopreserved, and evaluated for sperm-quality parameters. Addition of FAs<ORGANIZATION> to the extender increased progressive motility, acrosome integrity, membrane integrity, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and decreased percentage abnormality and sperm malondialdehyde level compared with the control group. However, excessive FA addition ( > 0.4 %, w/w ) to semen extenders did not improve the efficiency. The results indicated that FAs<ORGANIZATION> could be a promising cryoprotectant for goat buck sperm.
