 Previous studies of the laryngectomized vocal tract using formant frequencies reported contradictory findings. Imagining studies of the vocal tract in alaryngeal speakers are limited due to the possible radiation effect as well as the cost and time associated with the studies. The present study examined the vocal tract configuration of laryngectomized individuals using acoustic reflection technology. Thirty alaryngeal and 30 laryngeal male speakers of Cantonese<GPE> participated in the study. A pharyngometer was used to obtain volumetric information of the vocal tract. All speakers were instructed to imitate the production of /a/ when the length and volume information of the oral cavity, pharyngeal cavity, and the entire vocal tract were obtained. The data of alaryngeal and laryngeal speakers were compared. Pharyngometric measurements revealed no significant difference in the vocal tract dimensions between laryngeal and alaryngeal speakers. Despite the removal of the larynx and a possible alteration in the pharyngeal cavity during total laryngectomy, the vocal tract configuration ( length and volume ) in laryngectomized individuals was not significantly different from laryngeal speakers. It is suggested that other factors might have affected formant measures in previous studies.
