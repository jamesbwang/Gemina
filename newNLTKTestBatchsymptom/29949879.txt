 PPAR<ORGANIZATION> & gamma ; belongs to the group of nuclear receptors which is expressed in the trophoblast and together with other factors is responsible for the maintenance of pregnancy. Apart from that PPAR<ORGANIZATION> & gamma ; is also a main factor for macrophage polarization. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined expression pattern and frequency of PPAR<ORGANIZATION> & gamma ; under physiological circumstances and in spontaneous and recurrent miscarriages in the trophoblast and in maternal macrophages of the decidua. Human<PERSON> placental tissues of the first trimester ( 15 physiologic pregnancies, 15 spontaneous abortion and 16 recurrent miscarriage placentas ) were analyzed for expression of the nuclear receptor PPAR<ORGANIZATION> & gamma ;. Expression changes were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and real time PCR<ORGANIZATION> ( RT-PCR ) in trophoblast and in maternal macrophages of the decidua. Maternal macrophages were identified by double immunofluorescence using cluster of differentiation 68 ( CD68<ORGANIZATION> ) as marker for macrophages and further characterized regarding their M1/M2 polarization status. The intermediate villous trophoblast revealed a significantly lower PPAR<ORGANIZATION> & gamma ; expression in spontaneous and recurrent abortion. Maternal macrophages express PPAR<ORGANIZATION> & gamma ;. Their number is significantly enhanced in the decidua of spontaneous miscarriages whereas in recurrent miscarriages maternal macrophages seem to express PPAR<ORGANIZATION> & gamma ; only in very few cases. PPAR<ORGANIZATION> & gamma ; is associated with an M2 polarization state that is common for decidual macrophages. The lack of PPAR<ORGANIZATION> & gamma ; in recurrent miscarriage decidual macrophages seems to be associated with a specific inflammatory response against the fetus.
