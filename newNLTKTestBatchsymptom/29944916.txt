 Cockayne<PERSON> Syndrome<ORGANIZATION> ( CS ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which leads to neurodegeneration, growth failure and premature aging. Most of the cases are due to mutations in the ERCC6<ORGANIZATION> gene, which encodes the protein CSB<ORGANIZATION>. CSB<ORGANIZATION> is involved in several functions including DNA<ORGANIZATION> repair and transcription. Here we describe two Danish<GPE> brothers with Cockayne Syndrome<PERSON>. Both patients carried a novel splice site mutation ( c.2382 + 2T > G ), and a previously described nonsense mutation ( c.3259C > T, p.Arg1087X ) in a biallelic state. Both patients presented the cardinal features of the disease including microcephaly, congenital cataract and postnatal growth failure. In addition, their fibroblasts were hypersensitive to UV irradiation and exhibited increased superoxide levels in comparison to fibroblasts from healthy age and gender matched individuals. Metabolomic<ORGANIZATION> analysis revealed a distinctive metabolic profile in cells from the CS<ORGANIZATION> patients compared to control cells. Among others, Î±-ketoglutarate, hydroxyglutarate and certain amino acids ( ornithine, proline and glycine ) were reduced in the CS<ORGANIZATION> patient fibroblasts, whereas glycolytic intermediates ( glucose-6-phosphate and pyruvic acid ) and fatty acids ( palmitic, stearic and myristic acid ) were increased. Our data not only provides additional information to the database of CS<ORGANIZATION> mutations, but also points towards targets for potential treatment of this devastating disease.
