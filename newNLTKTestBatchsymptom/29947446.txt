 P-wave duration, its dispersion and signal-averaged ECG<ORGANIZATION>, are currently used markers of vulnerability to atrial fibrillation ( AF ). However, since tangential atrial currents are better detectable at the body surface as magnetic than electric signals, we investigated the accuracy of magnetocardiographic mapping ( MCG<ORGANIZATION> ), recorded in unshielded clinical environments, as predictor of AF<ORGANIZATION> occurrence. MCG<ORGANIZATION> recordings, in sinus rhythm ( SR ), of 71 AF patients and 75 controls were retrospectively analyzed. Beside electric and magnetic P-wave and PR<ORGANIZATION> interval duration, two MCG<ORGANIZATION> P-wave subintervals, defined P-dep and P-rep, were measured, basing on the point of inversion of atrial magnetic field ( MF ). Eight parameters were calculated from inverse solution with `` Effective Magnetic Dipole<ORGANIZATION> ( EMD<ORGANIZATION> ) model '' and 5 from `` MF Extrema '' analysis. Discriminant analysis ( DA<ORGANIZATION> ) was used to assess MCG<ORGANIZATION> predictive accuracy to differentiate AF patients from controls. All but one ( P-rep ) intervals were significantly longer in AF patients. At univariate analysis, three EMD<ORGANIZATION> parameters differed significantly: in AF patients, the dipole-angle-elevation angular speed was lower during P-dep ( p < 0.05 ) and higher during P-rep ( p < 0.001 ) intervals. The space-trajectory during P-rep and the angle-dynamics during P-dep were higher ( p < 0.05 ), whereas ratio-dynamics P-dep was lower ( p < 0.01 ), in AF. At DA<ORGANIZATION>, with a combination of MCG<ORGANIZATION> and clinical parameters, 81.5 % accuracy in differentiating AF patients from controls was achieved. At Cox-regression, the angle-dynamics P-dep was an independent predictor of AF<ORGANIZATION> recurrences ( p = 0.037 ). Quantitative analysis of atrial MF dynamics in SR and the solution of the inverse problem provide new sensitive markers of vulnerability to AF.
