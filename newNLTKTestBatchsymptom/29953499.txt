 MALT1<GPE> controls several receptors-mediated signaling to nuclear factor κB ( NF-κB ) through both its scaffold and protease function. MALT1<ORGANIZATION> protease activity is shown to inactivate several negative regulators of NF-κB signaling and augment NF-κB activation ability. In this study, MALT1<ORGANIZATION> was demonstrated to autoprocess itself in the presence of oligomerization-competent BCL10<ORGANIZATION>. Cleavage<PERSON> occurred after Arginine 781 located in the C-terminus of MALT1<ORGANIZATION>. Shortened MALT1<ORGANIZATION> cleavage products showed attenuated binding ability with TRAF6<ORGANIZATION>. Its NF-κB activation ability was also weakened. Various MALT1<PERSON> constructs including wild type, catalytically-inactive ( MALT1_C464A<ORGANIZATION> ), cleavage-defective ( MALT1_R781L<ORGANIZATION> ), or truncated ( MALT1_1-781 ) form of MALT1<ORGANIZATION> was introduced into MALT1-knocked-down-Jurkat T cells. Cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L<ORGANIZATION> retained its proteolytic and initial IκBα<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation activity as MALT1<ORGANIZATION>. Truncated MALT1_1-781 mutant showed weakness in IκBα<GPE> phosphorylation and the expression of NF-κB targets IL-2 and IFN-γ. Cleavage at R781<ORGANIZATION> was detectable but marginal after activation with TPA/ionomycin or anti-CD3 antibody in lymphocytes. However, cleavage at R781<ORGANIZATION> was evident in ABC-DLBCL cells such as OCI-Ly3, HBL-1. HBL-1 cells with induced expression of catalytically-inactive MALT1_C464A<ORGANIZATION> or cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L<ORGANIZATION> exhibited characteristic of retarded-growth. These findings suggested that cleavage at R781<ORGANIZATION> of MALT1<ORGANIZATION> played a role in the survival of ABC-DLBCL cells.
