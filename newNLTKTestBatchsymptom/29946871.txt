 Gastric<GPE> and esophageal dysmotility syndromes are some of the most common motility diagnoses, but little is known about their interrelationship. The aim of our study was to determine if a correlation exists between gastric and esophageal dysmotility syndromes. We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent both solid gastric emptying scintigraphy ( GES<ORGANIZATION> ) and high-resolution esophageal manometry ( HRM<ORGANIZATION> ) within a 2 year period, with both done between August 2012 and August 2017. All GESs<ORGANIZATION> were classified as either rapid, normal, or delayed. All HRMs were classified according to the Chicago<ORGANIZATION> Classification 3.0. Correlations were assessed using Fisher<PERSON> 's exact test and multiple logistic regression. In total, 482 patients met inclusion criteria. Of patients with a normal, delayed, and rapid GES<ORGANIZATION>, 53.1, 64.5, and 77.3 % had an abnormal HRM<ORGANIZATION>, respectively ( p < 0.05 vs. normal GES ). Likewise<PERSON>, patients with an abnormal HRM were more likely to have an abnormal GES<ORGANIZATION> ( 54.9 vs. 41.8 %, p = 0.005 ). Multiple logistic regression showed abnormal GES<ORGANIZATION> [ odds ratio ( OR ) 2.14 ], age ( OR 1.013 ), scleroderma ( OR 6.29 ), and dysphagia ( OR 2.63 ) were independent predictors of an abnormal HRM<ORGANIZATION>. Likewise<PERSON>, an abnormal HRM<ORGANIZATION> ( OR 2.11 ), diabetes ( OR 1.85 ), heart or lung transplantation ( OR 2.61 ), and autonomic dysfunction ( OR 2.37 ) were independent predictors of an abnormal GES<ORGANIZATION>. The correlation between an abnormal GES<ORGANIZATION> and HRM<ORGANIZATION> argues for common pathogenic mechanisms of these motility disorders, and possibly common future treatment options. Clinicians<PERSON> should have a high index of suspicion for another motility disorder if one is present.
