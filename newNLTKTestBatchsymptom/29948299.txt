 Giant<GPE> cavernous carotid aneurysms ( GCCAs<ORGANIZATION> ) usually exert substantial mass effect on adjacent intracavernous cranial nerves. Since predictors of cranial nerve deficits ( CNDs<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with GCCA<ORGANIZATION> are unknown, we designed a study to identify associations between CND<ORGANIZATION> and GCCA<ORGANIZATION> morphology and the location of mass effect. This study was based on data from the prospective clinical and imaging databases of the Giant Intracranial Aneurysm Registry<ORGANIZATION>. We used magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography to examine GCCA<ORGANIZATION> volume, presence of partial thrombosis ( PT ), GCCA<ORGANIZATION> origins, and the location of mass effect. We also documented whether CND<ORGANIZATION> was present. We included 36 GCCA in 34 patients, which had been entered into the registry by eight participating centers between January 2009 and March 2016. The prevalence of CND<ORGANIZATION> was 69.4 %, with one CND in 41.7 % and more than one in 27.5 %. The prevalence of PT<ORGANIZATION> was 33.3 %. The aneurysm origin was most frequently located at the anterior genu ( 52.8 % ). The prevalence of CND<ORGANIZATION> did not differ between aneurysm origins ( p = 0.29 ). Intracavernous mass effect was lateral in 58.3 %, mixed medial/lateral in 27.8 %, and purely medial in 13.9 %. CND<ORGANIZATION> occurred significantly more often in GCCA<ORGANIZATION> with lateral ( 81.0 % ) or mixed medial/lateral ( 70.0 % ) mass effect than in GCCA<ORGANIZATION> with medial mass effect ( 20.0 % ; p = 0.03 ). After adjusting our data for the effects of the location of mass effect, we found no association between the prevalence of CND<ORGANIZATION> and aneurysm volume ( odds ratio ( OR ) 1.30 ( 0.98-1.71 ) ; p = 0.07 ), the occurrence of PT<GPE> ( OR 0.64 ( 0.07-5.73 ) ; p = 0.69 ), or patient age ( OR 1.02 ( 95 % CI 0.95-1.09 ) ; p = 0.59 ). Distinguishing between medial versus lateral location of mass effect may be more helpful than measuring aneurysm volumes or examining aneurysm thrombosis in understanding why some patients with GCCA<ORGANIZATION> present with CND<ORGANIZATION> while others do not.
