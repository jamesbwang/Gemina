 Patients with cleft lip and palate ( CLP<ORGANIZATION> ) have commonly reduced nasal airways and are more prone to snoring, mouth breathing and hypopnea during sleep. Therefore, the morphometric evaluation of pharyngeal airway in patients with CLP<ORGANIZATION> is crucial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharyngeal airway volumes of patients with CLP<ORGANIZATION> who underwent nasoalveolar molding ( NAM<ORGANIZATION> ) and to compare them with a well-matched control group without NAM<ORGANIZATION>. The study consisted of 40 patients with CLP<ORGANIZATION> divided into 2 main groups ( 26 with NAM<ORGANIZATION> ; 14 without NAM<ORGANIZATION> ) and 4 subgroups ( 15 unilateral CLP<ORGANIZATION> [ UCLP ] with NAM<ORGANIZATION>, mean age: 10.13 ± 1.30 years ; 11 bilateral CLP<ORGANIZATION> [ BCLP ] with NAM<ORGANIZATION>, mean age: 10.55 ± 1.51 years ; 7 UCLP without NAM<ORGANIZATION>, mean age: 9.86 ± 1.68 years ; 7 BCLP without NAM<ORGANIZATION>, mean age: 10.28 ± 1.89 years ). Nasopharyngeal<PERSON>, oropharyngeal, and total airway volumes of all the patients were calculated 3-dimensionally with cone-beam computed tomography. There were statistically significant differences in nasopharyngeal volume ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) of NAM<ORGANIZATION> group compared to control group ; however, volumetric differences in oropharyngeal and total pharyngeal airway were not significant ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). The amount of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and total pharyngeal airway size in the BCLP<ORGANIZATION> with NAM<ORGANIZATION> group was significantly larger compared to BCLP<ORGANIZATION> without NAM<ORGANIZATION> group ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). However, UCLP<ORGANIZATION> did not show any significant difference in NAM<ORGANIZATION> group ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). This study implies that NAM<ORGANIZATION> can effectively enlarge the nasopharyngeal airway size in patient with CLP<ORGANIZATION>. In addition, the pharyngeal airway volume enlargement is more apparent in BCLP<ORGANIZATION> than UCLP<ORGANIZATION> individuals.
