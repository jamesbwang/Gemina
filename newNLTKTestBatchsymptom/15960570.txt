 To overcome nonadherence in patients with psychosis switch to long-acting injectable ( LAI<ORGANIZATION> ) antipsychotic formulations is adopted. Most oral versus LAI<ORGANIZATION> comparisons showed similar antipsychotic responses. Psychoses often overlap with substance use disorder ( SUD<ORGANIZATION> ). Head-to-head LAI<ORGANIZATION> comparisons have hitherto focused only on non-comorbid populations. The objective of this study was to compare two LAIs<ORGANIZATION>, administered for 12 months, in initially hospitalized patients with psychosis comorbid with SUD<ORGANIZATION> in their clinical and quality of life ( QoL<ORGANIZATION> ) outcomes. Inpatients were recruited during 2016 and switched randomly to 400 mg intramuscular aripiprazole monohydrate ( AM<ORGANIZATION> ) ( N=50 ) or to 100 mg intramuscular paliperidone palmitate ( PP ) once-monthly ( N=51 ) ; patients were discharged and followed up for 12 months. Patients were rated at baseline and after 1 year through the Clinical Global Impression<ORGANIZATION> scale - severity ( CGIs<ORGANIZATION> ), substance craving intensity was rated through a visual analog scale for substance craving, and QoL<ORGANIZATION> through the World<ORGANIZATION> Health Organization ( WHOQOL-BREF ) scale. We addressed confounders with backward stepwise logistic regression and three-way analysis of variance. PP were older and had more cases of schizophrenia spectrum and less bipolar disorders than AM<ORGANIZATION>, but AM<ORGANIZATION> had a stronger craving for substances at baseline. Both LAIs were associated with significant improvements in all outcomes, with AM<ORGANIZATION> displaying stronger effect sizes than PP. The two groups did not differ on baseline WHOQOL-BREF scores in any domain, but at the 1-year follow-up, AM<ORGANIZATION> fared better on all domains. The two groups did not differ in final severity, but PP<ORGANIZATION> scored higher than AM in craving at the 1-year endpoint. 1-year AM and PP<ORGANIZATION> was followed by improved clinical status and QoL<ORGANIZATION> and reduced substance craving in a population with psychosis and SUD<ORGANIZATION> comorbidity. AM, compared to PP, improved craving and QoL<ORGANIZATION> at the 1-year follow-up.
