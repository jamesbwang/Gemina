 This retrospective study evaluated the effect of using neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES<ORGANIZATION> ) for the treatment of post-stroke urinary incontinence ( PSUI<ORGANIZATION> ) among female population in China.A<GPE> total of 163 eligible patients with PSUI<ORGANIZATION> were included in this study. Of these, 103 patients were assigned to a treatment group, and 60 subjects were assigned to a control group. All patients in both groups received bladder training. In addition, patients in the treatment group also received NMES<ORGANIZATION>. All patients were treated for a total of 8 weeks. The outcome measurements included the amount of urine leakage, urinary symptoms and quality of life. The urinary symptoms were measured by the Bristol Female Urinary Symptoms Questionnaire<FACILITY> ( BFUSQ<ORGANIZATION> ) score, and the quality of life was assessed by the International Consultation<ORGANIZATION> on Incontinence<FACILITY> Questionnaire-Short Form ( ICIQ-SF ) score. In addition, adverse events were also documented in this study.After 4-week treatment, patients who received NMES<ORGANIZATION> did not exert better outcomes in the amount of urine leakage, urinary symptoms, measured by BFUSQ<ORGANIZATION> scale, and the quality of life, assessed by ICIQ-SF scale. However, after 8-week treatment, patients in the treatment group showed greater effect in reducing the amount of urine leakage ( P<PERSON> < .01 ), enhancing urinary symptoms, as measured by BFUSQ<ORGANIZATION> scale ( P<PERSON> < .01 ), and improving the quality of life, as assessed by ICIQ-SF scale ( P<PERSON> < .01 ), compared with patients in the control group. In addition, no adverse event was recorded during the period of 8-week treatment in this study.The results of this study indicated that NMES<ORGANIZATION> may benefit for patients with PSUI<ORGANIZATION> after 8-week treatment. Future studies should focus on warranting the results of this study.
