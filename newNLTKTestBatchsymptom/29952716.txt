 The inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II ( INPP4B<ORGANIZATION> ) has been mostly proposed to act as a tumor suppressor whose expression is frequently dysregulated in numerous human cancers. To date, little is unveiled about whether and how INPP4B<ORGANIZATION> will exert its tumor suppressive function on the turnover of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion system in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas ( PDACs<ORGANIZATION> ) in vitro. Here we provide the evidence that INPP4B<ORGANIZATION> manipulates cadherin switch in certain PDAC<ORGANIZATION> cell lines through a phosphorylated AKT-inactivation manner. The knockdown of INPP4B<ORGANIZATION> in AsPC-1 results in a more invasive phenotype, and overexpression of it in PANC-1 leads to partial reversion of mesenchymal status and impediment of in vitro invasion but not migration. More importantly, E-cadherin ( Ecad<ORGANIZATION> ) is enriched in the early and sorting endosomes containing INPP4B<ORGANIZATION> by which its recycling rather than degradation is enabled. Immunohistochemical analysis of 39 operatively resected PDAC<ORGANIZATION> specimens reveals it is poorly differentiated, non-cohesive ones in which the INPP4B<ORGANIZATION> and Ecad are partially or completely compromised in expression. We therefore identify INPP4B<ORGANIZATION> as an tumor suppressor in PDAC<ORGANIZATION> which attenuates AKT<ORGANIZATION> activation and participates in preservation of Ecad<GPE> in endocytic pool and cellular membrane.
