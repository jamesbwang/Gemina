 Transport of late endosomes and lysosome-related organelles ( LE/LROs ) in axons is essential for supplying synaptic cargos and for removing damaged macromolecules. Defects in this system are implicated in a range of human neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. The findings reported here identify a novel mechanism regulating LE/LRO transport based on the coordinated coupling of microtubule motors and vesicle coat proteins to the neuron-enriched, transmembrane protein Calcyon<GPE> ( Caly<GPE> ). We found that the cytoplasmic C-terminus of Caly<GPE> pulled down proteins involved in microtubule dependent transport ( DIC<ORGANIZATION>, KIF5A<ORGANIZATION>, p150Glued, Lis1<GPE> ) and organelle biogenesis ( AP-1 and AP-3 ) from brain. In addition, RNAi<ORGANIZATION> mediated knockdown of Caly<GPE> increased the percent of static LE/LROs labeled by LysoTracker<ORGANIZATION> in cultured dorsal root ganglion axons. In contrast, over-expression of Caly<GPE> stimulated movement of organelles positive for LysoTracker<ORGANIZATION> or the AP-3 cargo GFP-PI4KIIÎ±. However, a Caly<GPE> mutant ( ATEA<ORGANIZATION> ) that does not bind AP-3 was unable to pull down motor proteins from brain, and expression of the ATEA<ORGANIZATION> mutant failed to increase either LE/LRO flux or levels of associated dynein. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that Caly<GPE> is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that regulates axonal transport of LE/LROs by coordinately interacting with motor and vesicle coat proteins.
