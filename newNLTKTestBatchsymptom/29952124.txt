 Periodic<GPE> limb movements during sleep present with repetitive movements, typically in the lower limbs, during sleep. Periodic<PERSON> limb movements during sleep have been proposed to be associated with increased risk of heart diseases. The aim of this study was to examine the co-morbidity rates of heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease and cardiovascular disease, in subjects with or without periodic limb movements during sleep through a meta-analysis. An electronic review of PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Embase<GPE>, ScienceDirect<ORGANIZATION>, Cochrane Library<PERSON>, ProQuest<ORGANIZATION>, Web of Science<GPE>, ClinicalKey<ORGANIZATION> and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed. Clinical<PERSON> studies, case-controlled trials and cohort studies were all included in the search. Case<PERSON> reports or series, and non-clinical studies were excluded. A meta-analysis of the results of six studies comparing the prevalence of coronary artery disease/acute myocardial infarction/cardiovascular disease in subjects with/without periodic limb movements during sleep was performed. There were significantly higher co-morbidity rates of coronary artery disease ( odds ratio = 1.568, 95 % confidence interval: 1.187-2.073, p = 0.002 ) and cardiovascular disease ( odds ratio = 1.279, 95 % confidence interval: 1.095-1.494, p = 0.002 ), but not acute myocardial infarction ( odds ratio = 1.272, 95 % confidence interval = 0.942-1.718, p = 0.117 ), in the periodic limb movements during sleep group than in the non-periodic limb movements during sleep group. This meta-analysis highlights the importance of a significantly high prevalence of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular disease in subjects with periodic limb movements during sleep. Further studies should be focused on the potential pathophysiology, and whether treatment for periodic limb movements during sleep can improve the outcome of heart disease.
