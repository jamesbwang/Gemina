 Recently, an immunodeficiency syndrome caused by guanine-adenine-thymine-adenine 2 ( GATA2<ORGANIZATION> ) deficiency has been described. The syndrome is characterized by ( i ) typical onset in early adulthood, ( ii ) profound peripheral blood cytopenias of monocytes, B lymphocytes, and NK<ORGANIZATION> cells, ( iii ) distinct susceptibility to disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacterial ( NTM<ORGANIZATION> ) and other opportunistic infections ( particularly human papillomavirus ), and ( iv ) a high risk of developing hematologic malignancies ( myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS<ORGANIZATION> ) ; acute myeloid leukemias ( AML<ORGANIZATION> ) ). Considerable clinical heterogeneity exists among patients with GATA2<ORGANIZATION> deficiency, but once infectious symptoms occur or MDS/AML arises, survival declines significantly. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT<ORGANIZATION> ) currently provides the only curative treatment option for both MDS/AML and dysfunctional immunity with life-threatening opportunistic infections. Strategies regarding timing of allogeneic HCT<ORGANIZATION>, antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment, intensity of the preparative regimen, and optimal donor and graft source have not been clearly defined due to the rarity of the disease. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the available literature and published case reports on the use of allogeneic HCT in patients with GATA2<ORGANIZATION> deficiency. In addition, a case of a young woman with GATA2<ORGANIZATION> deficiency, who developed an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in her mycobacterial skin lesions post allogeneic HCT<ORGANIZATION> is presented and illustrates distinct problems encountered in this disease context.
