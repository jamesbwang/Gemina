 Mobile<GPE> health interventions to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy among adolescents and young adults living with HIV<ORGANIZATION> represent a promising strategy. This pilot study ( N = 37 ) evaluated the psychosocial impacts of an efficacious adherence intervention, cell phone support ( CPS<ORGANIZATION> ). Participants receiving CPS<ORGANIZATION> reported significant decreases in perceived stress, depression, and illicit substance use, and increases in self-efficacy during at least one study assessment period, in comparison to participants receiving usual care. Future<PERSON> research using a larger sample should test for mediators of treatment efficacy to further characterize how cell phone interventions impact adherence.
