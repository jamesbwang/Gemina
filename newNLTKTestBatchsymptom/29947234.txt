 We want to investigate the protective effects of apelin-13 on myocardial ischemia reperfusion ( I/R ) injury. 30 Wistar Albino<ORGANIZATION> rat were divided into 5 groups ( n:6 ), namely control group ( C ), diabetes group ( D ), diabetes+apelin-13 group ( DA<ORGANIZATION> ), diabetes+I/R group ( DIR<ORGANIZATION> ) and diabetes I/R+apelin-13 group ( DIR-A ). Rats were subjected to 30‑min ischemia and 90‑min reperfusion. Biochemical<PERSON> and histopathological parameters were measured. Caspase-3 enzyme activity was significantly higher in the DIR<ORGANIZATION> group than in the C, DA<ORGANIZATION>, and DIR-A groups. The intensity of caspase 3 enzyme activity was significantly higher in the I/R group than in all other groups. Inflammation and vascular dilatation were found significantly higher in the DIR<ORGANIZATION> group than in all other groups. Congestion was significantly higher in the DIR<ORGANIZATION> group than in the C and D groups. TOS<ORGANIZATION> enzyme activity was significantly higher in the DIR<ORGANIZATION> group than in the C, DA<ORGANIZATION> and DIR-A groups. TAS<ORGANIZATION> enzyme activity was significantly lower in the DIR<ORGANIZATION> group than in the C and DIR-A groups. We believe that the protective effects of apelin-13 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and its use indications can be demonstrated in detail as long as the findings we have reached in our study are supported by other studies ( Tab<ORGANIZATION>. 2, Fig<PERSON>. 10, Ref<PERSON>. 43 ).
