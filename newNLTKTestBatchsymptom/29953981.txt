 Caffeine<GPE> can exacerbate tremor. Reducing caffeine intake or switching to decaffeinated beverages can lessen tremor. Unaffected relatives of essential tremor ( ET ) cases often have mild, subclinical tremor. One question is whether the coffee and tea consumption pattern in these individuals differs from that of controls ( Co ). We ascertained the patterns of coffee and tea intake using a structured questionnaire, and compared the use in unaffected first-degree relatives of ET<ORGANIZATION> cases ( FD-ET ) to the use in age-matched Co. Three measures of relative caffeinated coffee + tea to decaffeinated coffee + tea were constructed. Caffeine<PERSON> index 1 = ( cups of caffeinated coffee + tea ) - ( cups of decaffeinated coffee + tea ) consumed on the day of evaluation. Caffeine<PERSON> index 2 = ( cups of caffeinated coffee + tea ) - ( cups of decaffeinated coffee + tea ) consumed in a typical month. The percentage of coffee and tea that was caffeinated in a typical month was also calculated. There were 263 individuals ( 190 FD-ET, 73 Co ). Caffeine<PERSON> index 1 in FD-ET was less than 1-half that of Co<GPE> ( p = 0.001 ). Caffeine<PERSON> index 2 was similarly lower in FD-ET than Co<GPE> ( p = 0.027 ). The percentage of coffee and tea that was caffeinated in a typical month was also significantly lower in FD-ET than Co<GPE> ( p = 0.018 ). The balance of caffeinated to decaffeinated beverages is different in FD-ET than Co. These data raise several intriguing questions. Among these is whether relatives of ET<ORGANIZATION> cases modify their caffeine consumption before disease onset.
