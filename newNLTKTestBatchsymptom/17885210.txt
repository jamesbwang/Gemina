 In 2014, the American Association<ORGANIZATION> of Cardiovascular<PERSON> and Pulmonary Rehabilitation Quality<PERSON> of Care Committee<ORGANIZATION> was asked to develop performance measures ( PMs<ORGANIZATION> ) to assess program quality and aid in program improvement and certification. A 3-step process was used to prioritize, develop, and then validate new PMs<ORGANIZATION> for both cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation programs. First, we surveyed national leadership, medical directors, and program directors to identify and rank various American Association<ORGANIZATION> of Cardiovascular<PERSON> and Pulmonary Rehabilitation<PERSON> potential PM topics. Then, the face validity of the drafted PMs<ORGANIZATION> was assessed in a second national survey. Finally, we assessed the inter- and intrarater reliability and feasibility of each PM by abstracting patient charts at programs throughout the United States<GPE>. At each step, modifications were made to refine and improve the measures for clarity, reliability, and consistency. Through survey answers received from 302 people ( 19 % response rate ), we identified 5 categories for PM<ORGANIZATION> development: optimal blood pressure control, tobacco use cessation, and improvement in functional capacity, depression, and sensation of dyspnea. After drafting the PMs<ORGANIZATION>, a second survey with 82 respondents ( 57 % response rate ), found that the proposed PMs<ORGANIZATION> had good face validity. Finally, we found excellent inter- and intrarater reliability for the blood pressure, functional capacity, depression, and dyspnea measures ( Îº generally > 0.80. ) However, validity concerns were raised about the tobacco intervention PM as written, and it continues to undergo further refinement and testing. We developed and validated 5 new PMs<ORGANIZATION> for use in cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation program quality assessment, improvement, and certification.
