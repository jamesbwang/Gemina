 Signal<GPE> transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3<ORGANIZATION> ) is constitutively activated in psoriatic skin inflammation and acts as a key player in the pathogenesis and progression of this autoimmune disease. Although numerous inhibitors that intervene in STAT3-associated pathways have been tested, an effective, highly specific inhibitor of STAT3<ORGANIZATION> has yet to be identified. Here, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo biological activity and therapeutic efficacy of a high-affinity peptide specific for STAT3<ORGANIZATION> ( APTstat3<ORGANIZATION> ) after topical treatment via intradermal and transcutaneous delivery. Using a preclinical model of psoriasis, we show that intradermal injection of APTstat3<ORGANIZATION> tagged with a 9-arginine cell-penetrating peptide ( APTstat3-9R ) reduced disease progression and modulated psoriasis-related cytokine signaling through inhibition of STAT3<ORGANIZATION> phosphorylation. Furthermore, by complexing APTstat3-9R with specific lipid formulations led to formation of discoidal lipid nanoparticles ( DLNPs<ORGANIZATION> ), we were able to achieve efficient skin penetration of the STAT3-inhibiting peptide after transcutaneous administration, thereby effectively inhibiting psoriatic skin inflammation. Collectively, these findings suggest that DLNP-assisted transcutaneous delivery of a STAT3-inhibiting peptide could be a promising strategy for treating psoriatic skin inflammation without causing adverse systemic events. Moreover, the DLNP<ORGANIZATION> system could be used for transdermal delivery of other therapeutic peptides.
