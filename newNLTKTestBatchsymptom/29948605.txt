 To compare oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL<ORGANIZATION> ) in children and adolescents with and without migration background, and to assess whether potential differences in OHRQoL<GPE> can be sufficiently explained by oral health characteristics. A consecutive sample of 112 children and adolescents was recruited in a German<GPE> university-based orthodontic clinic, and a convenience sample of 313 children and adolescents of German<GPE> public schools was enrolled in the study ( total N = 425, age range 7-17 years ). However, 29 participants were excluded due to insufficient information regarding migration background. Accordingly, the non-migrant group consisted of 262 participants ( 61.6 % ). For children with migration background, two groups were classified: ( i ) one parent born in a foreign country ( N = 41, 9.6 %, single-sided migration background ), and ( ii ) both parents and/or child born in a foreign country ( N= 93, 21.9 %, double-sided migration background ). OHRQoL<ORGANIZATION> was assessed using the German<GPE> 19-item version of the Child Oral Health Impact<ORGANIZATION> Profile ( COHIP-G19 ). Additionally, physical oral health of 269 children with classified migration background was determined in a dental examination. Overall, OHRQoL<ORGANIZATION> was significantly lower in the group with double-sided migration background indicated by lower COHIP-G19 summary scores ( mean: 58.6 points ) than in the group with single-sided migration background ( mean: 63.3 points ) or the non-migrant group ( mean: 63.2 points ). Likewise<PERSON>, the summary scores of the subscale `` oral health well-being '' and the subscale `` social/emotional, school, and self-image '' were also lower in the double-sided migrant group than in the other two groups. Linear<PERSON> regression analysis showed an association between double-sided migration background and impaired OHRQoL<ORGANIZATION>, even after statistically controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and oral health characteristics. Children<PERSON> and adolescents with double-sided migration background have poorer OHRQoL<ORGANIZATION> than comparably aged migrants with single-sided migration background or non-migrations. Between-group differences in OHRQoL<ORGANIZATION> could not be sufficiently explained by effects of socioeconomic status or physical oral health characteristics. Thus, other methodological, cultural, or immigration-related factors might also play an important role for the observed effects.
