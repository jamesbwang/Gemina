 After spinal cord injury ( SCI<ORGANIZATION> ), the initial goals of urological management include maintaining safe storage of urine with efficient bladder emptying, maximising urinary continence, and minimising the risk of urological complications. This review was performed according to the methodology recommended by the Joint<ORGANIZATION> SIU-ICUD International Consultation. Embase<PERSON> and Medline<GPE> databases were used to identify literature relevant to the early urological care of SCI<ORGANIZATION> patients. Recommendations were developed by consensus and graded using a modified Oxford<GPE> system which identifies level of evidence ( LOE<ORGANIZATION> ) and grade of recommendation ( GOR<ORGANIZATION> ). Clinicians<PERSON> must ensure appropriate bladder emptying immediately after SCI<ORGANIZATION> ( LOE<ORGANIZATION> 3, GOR<ORGANIZATION> A ) and perform the initial neuro-urological assessment within 3 months after injury ( LOE<ORGANIZATION> 3, GOR<ORGANIZATION> A ), including history, validated questionnaires, bladder diary, physical examination, measurement of renal function, and urinary tract imaging ( LOE<ORGANIZATION> 4, GOR<ORGANIZATION> B ). Urodynamics, if available video-urodynamics, must be performed to detect and specify lower urinary tract dysfunction ( LOE<ORGANIZATION> 1, GOR<ORGANIZATION> A ). Spontaneous voiding and/or intermittent catheterization must be considered in appropriate patients once they are medically stable ( LOE<ORGANIZATION> 3, GOR<ORGANIZATION> A ). Antimuscarinics are the first-line and intradetrusor botulinum toxin A injections are the second-line treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( LOE<ORGANIZATION> 1, GOR<ORGANIZATION> A ). Irreversible surgical interventions should be delayed until the second year after injury due to the potential for neurological recovery ( LOE<ORGANIZATION> 4, GOR<ORGANIZATION> B ). Careful<PERSON> clinical assessment and pertinent urological testing including urodynamic investigation are necessary for appropriate counselling and treatment of new SCI<ORGANIZATION> patients.
