 Modeling and simulations were used to support body weight-based dose selection for eslicarbazepine acetate ( ESL<ORGANIZATION> ) in pediatric subjects aged 4-17 years with partial-onset seizures. A one-compartment pediatric population pharmacokinetic model with formulation-specific first-order absorption, first-order elimination, and weight-based allometric scaling of clearance and distribution volume was developed with PK<ORGANIZATION> data from subjects 2-18 years of age treated with ESL<ORGANIZATION> 5-30 mg/kg/day. Covariate analysis was performed to quantify the effects of key demographic and clinical covariates ( including body weight and concomitant use of carbamazepine, levetiracetam, and phenobarbital-like antiepileptic drugs [ AEDs<ORGANIZATION> ] ) on variability in PK parameters. Model<PERSON> evaluation performed using a simulation-based visual predictive check and a non-parametric bootstrap procedure indicated no substantial bias in the overall model and in the accuracy of estimates. The model estimated that concomitant use of carbamazepine or phenobarbital-like AEDs<ORGANIZATION> with ESL<ORGANIZATION> would decrease the exposure of eslicarbazepine, and that concomitant use of levetiracetam with ESL<ORGANIZATION> would increase the exposure of eslicarbazepine, although the small effect of levetiracetam may not represent a true difference. Model-based simulations were subsequently performed to apply target exposure matching of selected ESL<ORGANIZATION> doses for pediatric subjects ( aged 4-17 years ) to attain eslicarbazepine exposures associated with effective and well-tolerated ESL<ORGANIZATION> doses in adults. Overall, model-based exposure matching allowed for extrapolation of efficacy to support pediatric dose selection as part of the submission to obtain FDA<ORGANIZATION> approval for ESL<ORGANIZATION> ( adjunctive therapy and monotherapy ) in subjects aged 4-17 years, without requiring an additional clinical study.
