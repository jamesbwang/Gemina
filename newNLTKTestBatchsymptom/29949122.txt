 Pitfall<GPE> traps are commonly used for the collection of terrestrial insects in ecology and biology studies ; they are relatively straightforward to manufacture and there is a large variety of models described in the literature. However, they present a few drawbacks: ( i ) the removal and transport of the collected material are not practical ; ( ii ) they have low resistance and durability ; ( iii ) they fail to correctly protect the attractive bait against adverse weather conditions and scavengers, and ( iv ) evaporation of the liquid used inside the trap. We proposed an optimized pitfall trap design for terrestrial insect collection made from cheap and easily accessible materials. The new design allows the transfer of the collected material to the lab by removing only that part of the trap where the insects have been captured ; the other part remains in its original place. Thus, the proposed trap allows easier operation since there is no need to transport water to replenish the traps after each transfer ; in addition, there is less volume and weight to be carried. The trap can remain in the field for months because of the durability of its material. Furthermore, the collected material is better protected against adverse weather conditions and scavengers. Currently<PERSON>, an efficient and rapid sampling strategy in the field is of global interest to understand mechanisms that can contribute to the monitor changes in phenology, succession, and biodiversity.
