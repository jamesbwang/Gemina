 Detection of focal cortical dysplasia ( FCD<ORGANIZATION> ) is of paramount importance in epilepsy presurgical evaluation. Our study aims at utilizing quantitative positron emission tomography ( QPET<ORGANIZATION> ) analysis to complement magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) postprocessing by a morphometric analysis program ( MAP<ORGANIZATION> ) to facilitate automated identification of subtle FCD<ORGANIZATION>. We retrospectively included a consecutive cohort of surgical patients who had a negative preoperative MRI by radiology report. MAP<ORGANIZATION> was performed on T1-weighted volumetric sequence and QPET<ORGANIZATION> was performed on PET/computed tomographic data, both with comparison to scanner-specific normal databases. Concordance between MAP<ORGANIZATION> and QPET<ORGANIZATION> was assessed at a lobar level, and the significance of concordant QPET-MAP A total of 104 patients were included. When QPET<ORGANIZATION> thresholds of SD<ORGANIZATION> = -1, -2, and -3 were used, complete resection of the QPET-MAP Our study demonstrates a practical and effective approach to combine quantitative analyses of functional ( QPET<ORGANIZATION> ) and structural ( MAP<ORGANIZATION> ) imaging data to improve identification of subtle epileptic abnormalities. This approach can be readily adopted by epilepsy centers to improve postresective seizure outcomes for patients without apparent lesions on MRI<ORGANIZATION>.
