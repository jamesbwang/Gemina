 To compare clinical variables, sonographic findings and pregnancy outcomes following the hysteroscopic removal of retained products of conception ( RPOC<ORGANIZATION> ) after delivery and abortion. This is a retrospective cohort of operative hysteroscopies performed between 2011 and 2015 for suspected RPOC<ORGANIZATION>, during which trophoblastic tissue was obtained. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, sonographic evaluation, subsequent infertility and pregnancy outcomes were compared between post-delivery ( n = 85 ) and post-abortion ( n = 93 ) cases. The main presenting symptom in both study groups was vaginal bleeding. On sonographic evaluation, maximal endometrial thickness was significantly higher in the post-delivery group, while irregularity and increased flow were more common in the post-abortion group. There was a similar rate of deliveries following hysteroscopy in both groups with 40 % in the post-delivery group and 39.7 % in the post-abortion group. Deliveries in the post-delivery group were characterized by a higher rate of abnormal placentation - 30.5 % - including low lying placenta and placenta accreta. A significant rate of vaginal deliveries in both groups entailed manual removal of the placenta or exploration of the uterine cavity ( 23.5 and 10.5 %, p = 0.20 ). Pregnancies following RPOC<ORGANIZATION> after delivery entail a higher rate of abnormal placentation.
