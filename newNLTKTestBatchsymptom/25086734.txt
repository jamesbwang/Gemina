 We here report a case of a 32-year-old man with genetically diagnosed myotonic dystrophy and persistent atrial fibrillation ( AF ) who underwent a low-voltage zone ( LVZ<ORGANIZATION> ) ablation. His cardiac function was normal except for a prophylactic pacemaker implantation for a high risk of complete atrioventricular block. An LVZ<ORGANIZATION> was found in the anteroseptal left atrium during sinus rhythm and was ablated during induced AF after a pulmonary vein antrum isolation, which terminated the AF<ORGANIZATION> and rendered it noninducible by rapid pacing and/or isoproterenol. During 20 months of follow-up, no atrial tachyarrhythmias were observed with pacemaker monitoring of antiarrhythmic drugs.
