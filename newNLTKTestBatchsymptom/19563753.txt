 Assisted reproductive technology ( ART<ORGANIZATION> ) has been associated with low birth weight of fresh embryo transfer ( FRESH<ORGANIZATION> ) derived and increased birth weight of frozen embryo transfer ( FET<ORGANIZATION> ) -derived newborns. Owing to that, we focused on imprinted insulin-like growth factor 2 ( A consistent trend of genotype-specific decreased methylation level was observed in paternal allele of rs10732516 paternal A/maternal G genotype, but not in paternal G/maternal A genotype, at The observed DNA<ORGANIZATION> methylation changes together with the phenotypic findings suggest that rs10732516 polymorphism associates with the effects of ART<ORGANIZATION> in a parent-of-origin manner. Therefore, this polymorphism should be considered when the effects of environmental factors on embryonic development are studied.
