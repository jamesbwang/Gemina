 Lichen<GPE> planus ( LP ) is a moderately prevalent inflammatory disorder that affects the skin and the oral mucosa, leading to a characteristic appearance and causing severe itching. To assess the potency of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS<ORGANIZATION> ) as an antipruritic line of treatment in patients with LP<ORGANIZATION>. We enrolled 30 patients with LP who had a history of recurrent relapses of confined pruritus forcing them to scratch or rub the affected area intensively. Patients were treated with TENS<ORGANIZATION> three times per week for 4 weeks. Severity of itching was estimated by visual analogue scale ( VAS<ORGANIZATION> ) and Dermatology Life Quality Index<PERSON> ( DLQI<ORGANIZATION> ). There was a statistically significant decline in mean VAS<ORGANIZATION> score at weeks 2 and 4 of treatment compared with baseline ( P<PERSON> < 0.05, with 74 % of participants having an improvement of > 50 %. Significant improvement in itching intensity also resulted in better quality of life, as there was also a significant reduction in median DLQI<ORGANIZATION> at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy compared with baseline ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ), with 65 % of patients having an improvement of > 50 % in median DLQI<ORGANIZATION> score. TENS may be an alternative safe treatment for LP-induced itching.
