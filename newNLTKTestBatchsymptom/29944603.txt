 A one-group, repeated-measures study explored the effect of repetitive practice with peer mentoring on skill competence and retention of vital signs and auscultation of breath and heart sounds in baccalaureate nursing students. Vital signs competence significantly increased after repetitive practice with peer mentoring. Skill<PERSON> competence in vital signs and auscultation of breath and heart sounds did not significantly change four months after repetitive practice with peer mentoring. This study suggests that repetitive practice with peer mentoring may show promise to enhance skill competence and retention ; however, more research is needed to support these findings.
