 The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of liver resection in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC<ORGANIZATION> ) patients with preoperative renal dysfunction ( RD ). Data from 735 patients undergoing primary liver resection for HCC<ORGANIZATION> between 2002 and 2014 were analyzed. Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between the RD<ORGANIZATION> group, defined by a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 45 mL/min/1.73 m Sixty-two patients had RD. The incidence of postoperative pleural effusion ( 24 vs. 11 % ; P<PERSON> = 0.007 ) and major complications ( Clavien-Dindo III-V ; 31 vs. 15 % ; P<PERSON> = 0.003 ) were significantly higher in RD patients. In RD patients with Child-Pugh A, 90-day mortality rate ( 1.9 % ) and median survival time ( 6.11 years ) were comparable to that of non-RD patients. In contrast, RD<ORGANIZATION> patients with Child-Pugh B had a very high 90-day mortality rate ( 22.2 % ), and a significant shorter median survival time compared to non-RD patients ( 1.19 vs. 4.84 years ; P<PERSON> = 0.001 ). Liver<PERSON> resection for Child-Pugh A patients with RD<ORGANIZATION> is safe and has comparable oncological outcomes compared to non-RD patients. However, selection of liver resection candidates from Child-Pugh B patients with RD<ORGANIZATION> should be stricter.
