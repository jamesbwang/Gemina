 Nepafenac<GPE> is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID<ORGANIZATION> ), currently only available as 0.1 % ophthalmic suspension ( Nevanac® ). This study utilized hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin ( HPBCD<ORGANIZATION> ) to increase the water solubility and trans-corneal permeation of nepafenac. The nepafenac-HPBCD complexation in the liquid and solid states were confirmed by phase solubility, differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC<ORGANIZATION> ), X-ray diffraction ( XRD<ORGANIZATION> ), Fourier<GPE> transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR ), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( NMR<ORGANIZATION> ) analyses. Nepafenac 0.1 % ophthalmic solution was formulated using HPBCD<ORGANIZATION> ( same pH and osmolality as that of Nevanac® ) and pig eye trans-corneal permeation was studied versus Nevanac®. Furthermore, nepafenac content in cornea, sclera, iris, lens, aqueous humor, choroid, ciliary body, retina, and vitreous humor was studied in a continuous isolated pig eye perfusion model in comparison to the suspension and Nevanac®. Permeation studies using porcine corneas revealed that the solution formulation had a permeation rate 18 times higher than Nevanac®. Furthermore, the solution had 11 times higher corneal retention than Nevanac®. Drug<PERSON> distribution studies using porcine eyes revealed that the solution formulation enables detectable levels in various ocular tissues while the drug was undetectable by Nevanac®. The ocular solution formulation had a significantly higher drug concentration in the cornea compared to the suspension or Nevanac®.
