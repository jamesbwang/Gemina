 We provide a review of the literature about the Androgen<ORGANIZATION> Insensitivity Syndrome ( AIS<ORGANIZATION> ), its onset and associated developmental anomalies and the genetic alterations causing it. We searched PubMed<ORGANIZATION> with a larger emphasis on the physiology, genetics and current management of AIS<ORGANIZATION>. AIS<ORGANIZATION> is an X-linked recessive Disorder of Sex Development<ORGANIZATION> ( DSD<ORGANIZATION> ). It is caused by mutations of the Androgen Receptor<ORGANIZATION>, and their large amount and heterogeneity ( missense and nonsense mutations, splicing variants, deletions, and insertions ) are responsible for the wide spectrum of possible phenotypes of patients, divided into Partial<ORGANIZATION> AIS ( PAIS<ORGANIZATION> ) and Complete<ORGANIZATION> AIS ( CAIS<ORGANIZATION> ). Once the clinical and laboratory investigations have laid the foundation for a diagnostic hypothesis, it is important to identify the actual karyotype of the individual and search for the mutation in the Androgen<ORGANIZATION> Receptor to diagnose with certainty the syndrome. Alternatively, in the absence of such evidence, the diagnosis should more properly be an AIS-like condition, which we describe as well in our report. The management of this DSD<ORGANIZATION> is based on pharmacotherapies, surgery and psychological support: all of them must be directed to facilitate the patient 's life, considering his/her sexual identity.
