 Chemotherapy-induced nausea can be distressing and difficult to manage in children with cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of ginger aromatherapy in relieving chemotherapy-induced nausea in children with cancer. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 49 children with cancer explored whether inhalation of the aroma of essential oil of ginger during chemotherapy decreased nausea compared with a placebo ( water ) or control ( Johnson<PERSON> 's baby shampoo ) measured by prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy assessment with the Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool<ORGANIZATION> ( PeNAT<ORGANIZATION> ). While well received, well tolerated, nontoxic, and noninvasive, ginger aromatherapy did not significantly decrease nausea in patients enrolled in this study. Among 21 patients who indicated feeling nausea prechemotherapy, 67 % reported improvement, 5 % worsening, and 28 % no change in their postinfusion PeNAT<ORGANIZATION> score. We failed to detect a statistical significant difference in the change in PeNAT<GPE> scores among the three groups.
