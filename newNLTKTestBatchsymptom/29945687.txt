 Human<GPE> papillomavirus ( HPV<ORGANIZATION> ) is a DNA<ORGANIZATION> virus linked to mucosal and cutaneous carcinogenesis. More than 200 different HPV<ORGANIZATION> types exist. We carried out a transversal study to investigate the prevalence of HPV<ORGANIZATION> types in two regions of Mexico<GPE>. A total of 724 genital and non-genital samples from women ( F ) and men ( M ) were studied ; 241 ( 33 % ) from North-Eastern<GPE> ( NE ) and 483 ( 66 % ) from South-Central ( SC ) Mexico<GPE>. The overall prevalence was 87 %. In genital lesions from females, the NE<ORGANIZATION> group showed a prevalence of HPV<ORGANIZATION> types 16 ( 37 % ), 6 ( 13 % ), 59 ( 6 % ), 11, 18 and 66 ( 5.4 % each ) ; and the SC<ORGANIZATION> group showed types 6 ( 17 % ), 16 ( 15 % ), 11 ( 14.5 % ), 18 ( 12 % ) and 53 ( 6 % ). In the genital lesions from males, NE<ORGANIZATION> group showed types 16 ( 38 % ), 6 ( 21 % ), 11 ( 13 % ) and 59 plus 31 ( 7.5 % ) and the SC<ORGANIZATION> group showed types 6 ( 25 % ), 11 ( 22 % ), 18 ( 17 % ) and 16 ( 11.5 % ). When the two regions were compared, a higher prevalence of low-risk HPV 6 and 11 was found in the SC<ORGANIZATION> region and of high-risk HPV 59, 31 and 66 ( the latter can also be present in benign lesions ) in the NE<ORGANIZATION> region. Our findings complement efforts to understand HPV<ORGANIZATION> demographics as a prerequisite to guide and assess the impact of preventive interventions.
