 Venous<GPE> thromboembolic events ( VTE<ORGANIZATION> ), with their life-threatening manifestation as pulmonary embolism, are potential adverse effects of intravenous methylprednisolone ( IVMP<ORGANIZATION> ) pulse therapy, partially due to a hypercoagulable state. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of IVMP<ORGANIZATION> on selected hemostatic parameters in patients with moderate-to-severe Graves ' orbitopathy ( GO ). 26 euthyroid patients with GO<ORGANIZATION> were treated with 12 pulses of IVMP<ORGANIZATION> ( 6 × 0.5, 6 × 0.25 g every week ). Hemostatic variables [ factor ( F ) II, FV<ORGANIZATION>, FVII<ORGANIZATION>, FVIII<ORGANIZATION>, fibrinogen, antithrombin, activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT<ORGANIZATION> ), prothrombin time, international normalized ratio of prothrombin time, platelets and D-dimer ] were analysed before, 24 and 48 h after 1st, 6th and 12th pulse. A constant, transient trend in changes of some hemostatic variables was observed after all assessed pulses. We discovered an increase in median activity of FVIII<ORGANIZATION> 24 and 48 h after pulses, with a shortening of aPTT<ORGANIZATION> 24 h after each IVMP pulse ( p < 0.00005 ). FVII<ORGANIZATION> decreased 24 h after each pulse ( p < 0.0005 after 1st and 12th, p < 0.00005 after 6th ). Fibrinogen level decreased 48 h after each pulse ( P<PERSON> < 0.00005 ). We did not observe any statistically significant changes in hemostatic parameters in the long-term evaluation. Therapy was concluded in one patient after the 9th pulse due to pulmonary embolism. The increase of FVIII<ORGANIZATION> activity is a consequence of treatment with IVMP<ORGANIZATION> and occurs after each pulse. In patients with additional risk factors of VTE<ORGANIZATION>, anticoagulation prophylaxis should be considered.
