 Amphotericin<PERSON> B ( AmB<ORGANIZATION> ) is an antifungal drug used for serious fungal infections and leishmaniosis. However, its clinical application is limited because of its high toxicity. To resolve this problem, herein we loaded AmB<ORGANIZATION> into methoxy poly ( ethylene glycol ) -b-poly ( l-glutamic acid-co-l-phenylalanine ) ( mPEG-b-P ( Glu-co-Phe ) ) nanoparticles ( l-AmB ) via electrostatic, hydrophobic and π-π interactions. The l-AmB has excellent stability both in PBS<ORGANIZATION> and in plasma and shows a remarkably reduced hemolysis ( 17.1 ± 1.5 %, 6 h ) compared to the free AmB ( 94.2 ± 5.3 %, 6 h ). The nephrotoxicity of l-AmB is significantly lower than that of free AmB. The maximum tolerance dose ( MTD<ORGANIZATION> ) of l-AmB is 3.0 mg kg-1, which is 3.75 fold that of free AmB ( MTD<ORGANIZATION> = 0.8 mg kg-1 ). The antimicrobial activity of the conjugate was retained in vivo, with l-AmB proving to be a more protective treatment for Aspergillus<ORGANIZATION> fumigatus infections in mice than AmB<ORGANIZATION> alone. These indicate that l-AmB is a formulation of AmB<ORGANIZATION> with low side effects.
