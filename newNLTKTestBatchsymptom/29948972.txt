 Detecting different molecular markers in primary tumors and metastases may provide therapeutic information. Here we investigated differences between primary tumors and four metastatic sites of lung adenocarcinoma in the biomarkers ' features and discussed potential therapeutic implications. A total of 228 patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed for EGFR<ORGANIZATION>, KRAS<ORGANIZATION>, BRAF<ORGANIZATION> and PIK3CA<ORGANIZATION> mutations detected by xTAG<ORGANIZATION> liquidchip technology ( xTAG-LCT ), as well as ERCC1<ORGANIZATION>, TYMS<ORGANIZATION>, RRM1<ORGANIZATION>, TUBB3<ORGANIZATION>, STMN1<ORGANIZATION>, TOP2A<ORGANIZATION> and VEGFR1-3 mRNA expression detected by branched DNA-liquidchip technology ( bDNA-LCT ). Higher rates of low ERCC1<ORGANIZATION> ( 35.6 vs. 20.3 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0105 ), RRM1<ORGANIZATION> ( 23.3 vs. 13.0 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0437 ), STMN1<GPE> ( 72.2 vs. 42.8 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0000 ) and high VEGFR2<ORGANIZATION> ( 34.4 vs. 18.8 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0078 ) mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression were found in EGFR-mutated tumors, suggesting possible benefit from platinum, gemcitabine, taxanes or VEGFR2<ORGANIZATION> inhibitors. Primary lesions showed low ERCC1<ORGANIZATION> ( 31.6 vs. 18.5 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0271 ), TYMS<ORGANIZATION> ( 17.6 vs. 7.6 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0300 ), TUBB3<GPE> ( 16.9 vs. 7.6 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0415 ), STMN1<GPE> ( 62.1 vs. 42.9 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0065 ) and high TOP2A ( 48.7 vs. 33.1 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0262 ) mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expression and higher KRAS<ORGANIZATION> mutations ( 25.7 vs. 14.1 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0350 ), suggesting platinum, taxanes, pemetrexed, anti-TOP2A agents and resistant to anti-EGFR therapies. Liver<PERSON> metastases showed absence of low TYMS<ORGANIZATION> expression, indicating insensitivity to pemetrexed-based regimen. Pleura<PERSON> metastases harbored higher rates of high VEGFR2<ORGANIZATION> expression ( 50.0 vs. 19.1 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0127 ). Lymph<PERSON> node metastases presented higher rates of high VEGFR2<ORGANIZATION> expression ( 37.5 vs. 19.1 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0253 ) and EGFR<ORGANIZATION> mutations ( 59.4 vs. 34.4 %, P<PERSON> = 0.0011 ), suggesting use of anti-VEGFR2 and anti-EGFR therapies. Molecular profiling of 228 lung adenocarcinomas determined a significant difference between biomarkers such as EGFR<ORGANIZATION> and KRAS<ORGANIZATION> subtypes at primary and metastatic sites. Our results serve as a reference for individual treatment based on different potential targets in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma directed by molecular profiling.
