 The main goal of the study was to characterize the behavioral and metabolomic profiles of repeated administration ( for 11 days ) of d-amphetamine ( AMPH<ORGANIZATION>, 3 mg/kg i. p. ), indirect agonist of dopamine ( DA<ORGANIZATION> ), in widely used 129S6/SvEvTac ( 129Sv ) and C57BL/6NTac ( Bl6 ) mouse strains. Acute<PERSON> administration of AMPH<ORGANIZATION> ( acute AMPH<ORGANIZATION> ) induced significantly stronger motor stimulation in Bl6<GPE>. However, repeated administration of AMPH<ORGANIZATION> ( repeated AMPH<ORGANIZATION> ) caused stronger motor sensitization in 129Sv compared acute AMPH<ORGANIZATION>. Body<PERSON> weight of 129Sv was reduced after repeated saline and AMPH<ORGANIZATION>, whereas no change occurred in Bl6<GPE>. In the metabolomic study, acute AMPH<ORGANIZATION> induced an elevation of isoleucine and leucine, branched chain amino acids ( BCAA<ORGANIZATION> ), whereas the level of hexoses was reduced in Bl6<GPE>. Both BCAAs<ORGANIZATION> and hexoses remained on level of acute AMPH<ORGANIZATION> after repeated AMPH<ORGANIZATION> in Bl6<GPE>. Three biogenic amines [ asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA<ORGANIZATION> ), alpha-aminoadipic acid ( alpha-AAA ), kynurenine ] were significantly reduced after repeated AMPH<ORGANIZATION>. Acute AMPH<PERSON> caused in 129Sv a significant reduction of valine, lysophosphatidylcholines ( lysoPC a C16:0, lysoPC a C18:2, lysoPC a C20:4 ), phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) diacyls ( PC<ORGANIZATION> aa C34:2, PC<ORGANIZATION> aa C36:2, PC<ORGANIZATION> aa C36:3, PC<ORGANIZATION> aa C36:4 ) and alkyl-acyls ( PC<ORGANIZATION> ae C38:4, PC<ORGANIZATION> ae C40:4 ). However, repeated AMPH<ORGANIZATION> increased the levels of valine and isoleucine, long-chain acylcarnitines ( C14<ORGANIZATION>, C14:1-OH, C16<PERSON>, C18:1 ), PC<ORGANIZATION> diacyls ( PC<ORGANIZATION> aa C38:4, PC<ORGANIZATION> aa C38:6, PC<ORGANIZATION> aa C42:6 ), PC<ORGANIZATION> acyl-alkyls ( PC<ORGANIZATION> ae C38:4, PC<ORGANIZATION> ae C40:4, PC<ORGANIZATION> ae C40:5, PC<ORGANIZATION> ae C40:6, PC<ORGANIZATION> ae C42:1, PC<ORGANIZATION> ae C42:3 ) and sphingolipids [ SM ( OH ) C22:1, SM<ORGANIZATION> C24:0 ] compared to acute AMPH<ORGANIZATION> in 129Sv. Hexoses and kynurenine were reduced after repeated AMPH<ORGANIZATION> compared to saline in 129Sv. The established changes probably reflect a shift in energy metabolism toward lipid molecules in 129Sv because of reduced level of hexoses. Pooled data from both strains showed that the elevation of isoleucine and leucine was a prominent biomarker of AMPH-induced behavioral sensitization. Simultaneously a significant decline of hexoses, citrulline, ADMA<ORGANIZATION>, and kynurenine occurred. The reduced levels of kynurenine, ADMA<ORGANIZATION>, and citrulline likely reflect altered function of N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA<ORGANIZATION> ) and NO<ORGANIZATION> systems caused by repeated AMPH<ORGANIZATION>. Altogether, 129Sv strain displays stronger sensitization toward AMPH<ORGANIZATION> and larger variance in metabolite levels than Bl6<PERSON>.
