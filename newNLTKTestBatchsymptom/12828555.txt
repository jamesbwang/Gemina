 Lenalidomide<GPE> is an analog of thalidomide, with potent anticancer activity demonstrated in several hematological malignancies. It has immunomodulatory properties, being able to enhance the activation of different types of immune cells, which results in antitumor activities. Dendritic<PERSON> cells ( DCs<ORGANIZATION> ) are pivotal in the immune response, and different immunotherapeutic approaches targeting these cells are being developed. Since little is known about the effect of lenalidomide on DCs<ORGANIZATION>, the goal of the present work was to investigate the phenotype and function of human monocyte-derived DCs<ORGANIZATION> differentiated in the presence of lenalidomide ( L-DCs ). Our results showed that L-DCs display a unique phenotype, with increased cell surface expression of some maturation markers such as CD1d<ORGANIZATION>, CD83<ORGANIZATION>, CD86<ORGANIZATION>, and HLA-DR. This phenotype correlates with a lower expression of the E3 ubiquitin-ligase MARCH-I in L-DCs, upregulating the cell surface expression of CD86<ORGANIZATION> and HLA-DR. In addition, immature L-DCs express higher amounts of DC-SIGN on the cell surface than control immature DCs<ORGANIZATION>. After LPS<ORGANIZATION> stimulation, production of IL-6 and TNF-α was severely decreased, whereas IL-12 and IL-10 secretion was dramatically upregulated in L-DCs, compared to that in the controls. Functionally, L-DCs are more effectively recognized by NKT<ORGANIZATION> cells in cytotoxicity experiments. Furthermore, L-DCs display higher opsonin-independent antigen uptake capability than control DCs<ORGANIZATION>. Mixed<PERSON> lymphocyte reaction experiments showed that L-DCs could stimulate naïve CD4<ORGANIZATION> T-cells, polarizing them toward a predominant Th1 phenotype. In summary, DCs<ORGANIZATION> derived from monocytes in the presence of lenalidomide present a semi-mature phenotype, increased phagocytic capacity, reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines, and the ability to polarize T-cells toward predominant Th1-type responses ; these are qualities that might be useful in the development of new immunotherapeutic treatments.
