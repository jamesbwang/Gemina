 The clinical impact of a decrease in impedance during radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA<ORGANIZATION> ) has not been fully clarified. The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of impedance decrease and to determine its optimal cutoff value during RFCA<ORGANIZATION>. We evaluated 34 consecutive patients ( total 3264 lesions, mean age 66 ± 8.7 years, 10 females ) who underwent their first ablation for atrial fibrillation ( AF ). The impedance decrease, average contact force ( CF ), application time, force-time integral ( FTI<ORGANIZATION> ), product of impedance decrease and application time ( PIT<ORGANIZATION> ), and the product of impedance decrease and FTI<ORGANIZATION> ( PIFT<ORGANIZATION> ) were measured for all lesions. Levels of cardiac troponin I ( TrpI<ORGANIZATION> ) were measured for assessment of myocardial injury. The incidence of intraprocedural pulmonary vein-left atrium reconnection or dormant conduction ( reconnection ) was determined. The relationships between the ablation parameters and the increase in TrpI<GPE> ( ΔTrpI<ORGANIZATION> ) were evaluated. The predictive value of the parameters for reconnection was assessed using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve analysis. Reconnection was detected in 18 patients. Average FTI<PERSON> and PIT<ORGANIZATION> were significantly correlated with ΔTrpI<ORGANIZATION> ( FTI<ORGANIZATION>: The combination of CF<ORGANIZATION> and a decrease in impedance could be important in the evaluation of myocardial lesions and reconnection during RFCA<ORGANIZATION>.
