 Gaucher<GPE> disease ( GD ) and primary myelofibrosis ( PMF<ORGANIZATION> ) share similar clinical and laboratory features, such as cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and marrow fibrosis, often resulting in a misdiagnosis. We report here the case of a young woman with hepatosplenomegaly, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Based on bone marrow ( BM ) findings and on liver biopsy showing extramedullary hematopoiesis, an initial diagnosis of PMF<ORGANIZATION> was formulated. The patient refused stem cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling. Low-dose melphalan was given, without any improvement. Two years later, a BM evaluation showed Gaucher cells. Low<PERSON> glucocerebrosidase and high chitotriosidase levels were indicative for GD<ORGANIZATION>. Molecular analysis revealed N370S/complex I mutations. Enzyme<PERSON> replacement therapy with imiglucerase was commenced, resulting in clinical and hematological improvements. Due<PERSON> to an unexpected and persistent organomegaly, PMF<ORGANIZATION> combined with GD<ORGANIZATION> were suspected. JAK2V617F<ORGANIZATION>, JAK2<ORGANIZATION> exon 12, MPL<ORGANIZATION>, calreticulin, and exon 9 mutations were negative, and BM<ORGANIZATION> examination showed no marrow fibrosis. PMF<ORGANIZATION> was excluded. Twenty years after starting treatment, the peripheral cell count and liver size were normal, whereas splenomegaly persisted. In order to avoid a misdiagnosis, a diagnostic algorithm for patients with hepatosplenomegaly combined with cytopenia is suggested.
