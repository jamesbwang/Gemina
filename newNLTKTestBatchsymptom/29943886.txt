 Low<GPE> serum chloride is common in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF<ORGANIZATION> ) and is associated with worse outcomes. We investigated the clinical and prognostic associations, including cause of death associations, of low serum chloride in patients referred to a secondary care clinic with suspected heart failure. Patients with echocardiogram and serum chloride were evaluated ( n = 5613 ). CHF<ORGANIZATION> was defined as signs and symptoms of the disease and either left ventricular systolic dysfunction ( LVSD<ORGANIZATION> ) worse than mild [ heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF<ORGANIZATION> ) ] or LVSD<ORGANIZATION> mild or better and raised amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) levels ( > 125 ng/L ) [ heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF<ORGANIZATION> ) ]. Hypochloraemia<PERSON> was defined as greater than two standard deviations below the mean in the local normal distribution ( < 96 mmol/L ). Of the 5613 patients referred, 908 patients did not have CHF<ORGANIZATION>, 1988 had HFrEF<ORGANIZATION>, and 2717 had HFpEF<ORGANIZATION>. Compared to patients in the fourth quartile ( median chloride 106 mmol/L ), patients in the first quartile ( median chloride 96 mmol/L ) had more severe symptoms ( 38 % New York<GPE> Heart Association class III<ORGANIZATION> or IV vs. 25 %, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ) and were more likely to take loop diuretics ( 79 % vs. 55 %, P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). The annual mortality rate for patients with CHF<ORGANIZATION> was 11 %. Hypochloraemia<PERSON> was associated with an increased risk of death independent of NT-proBNP. Patients in the first quartile had a two-fold increased risk of death compared to patients in the fourth quartile ( P<PERSON> < 0.001 ). Sudden<PERSON> death was a common mode of death amongst patients with hypochloraemia. Hypochloraemia<PERSON> is strongly related to an adverse prognosis and may be a therapeutic target in patients with CHF<ORGANIZATION>.
