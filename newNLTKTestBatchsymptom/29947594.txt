 RVM<ORGANIZATION> ON- and OFF<ORGANIZATION> cells are thought to facilitate and inhibit spinal nociceptive transmission, respectively. However, it is unknown how ON and OFF<ORGANIZATION> cells respond to pruritic stimuli or how they contribute to descending modulation of spinal itch signaling. In pentobarbital-anesthetized mice, single-unit recordings were made in RVM from ON<ORGANIZATION> and OFF<ORGANIZATION> cells identified by their respective increase or decrease in firing that occurred just prior to nocifensive hindlimb withdrawal elicited by paw pinch. Of RVM<ORGANIZATION> ON cells, 75 % ( 21/28 ) were excited by intradermal ( id ) histamine, 50 % ( 10/20 ) by id chloroquine, and 75 % ( 27/36 ) by id capsaicin. Most chemically-responsive units also responded to a scratch stimulus applied to the injected hindpaw. Few ON<PERSON> cells responded to id injection of vehicle ( saline: 5/32 ; Tween 2/17 ), but still responded to scratching. For OFF<ORGANIZATION> cells, id histamine and scratching inhibited 32 % ( 6/19 ) with no effect of histamine in the remainder. Id chloroquine inhibited 44 % ( 4/9 ) and id capsaicin inhibited 61 % ( 11/18 ) of OFF<ORGANIZATION> cells. Few<PERSON> OFF cells were affected by vehicles ( Tween: 1 inhibited, 7 unaffected ; saline: 3 excited, 1 inhibited, 8 unaffected ). Both ON and OFF<ORGANIZATION> cells that responded to one chemical usually also responded to others, while units unresponsive to the first-tested chemical tended not to respond to others. These results indicate that ascending pruriceptive signals activate RVM<ORGANIZATION> ON cells and inhibit RVM<ORGANIZATION> OFF cells. These effects are considered to facilitate and disinhibit spinal pain transmission, respectively. It is currently not clear if spinal itch transmission is similarly modulated.
