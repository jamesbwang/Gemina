 To evaluate the efficacy and safety of collagen biomaterial application during the 4-week follow-up of patients with diabetic foot syndrome. 75 patients with diabetic foot ( Wagner II<PERSON> ( 69.3 % ) and III<ORGANIZATION> ( 30.7 % ) ) aged 30-80 years were included in the multicenter study, among them were 50.7 % with the wound unhealed for 1.5-6 months and 49.3 % over 6-48 months. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: 1 ) standard therapy ( n=37 ), 2 ) the additional use of the collagen material Collost<GPE> ( n=38 ). Observation period was at least 4 weeks for each patient. The size of ulcers, results of general and biochemical blood tests, oximetry, microbiological testing, ultrasound of lower extremities vessels as well as a detailed medical history, social and functional status, level of cardiovascular comorbidity and ongoing therapy were estimated. Additional use of a collagen biomaterial has led to a significant reduction ulcers of all sizes from 13.5 to 2.1 cm We have proved the efficacy and safety of collagen biomaterial topical application in a diabetic foot syndrome treatment.
