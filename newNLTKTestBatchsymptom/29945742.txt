 The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the on-treatment lipid profiles and the CV<ORGANIZATION> events in CKD<ORGANIZATION> and non-CKD population. This study was a multi-center observational registry, the Taiwanese<GPE> Secondary Prevention for patients with AtheRosCLErotic<ORGANIZATION> disease ( T-SPARCLE ) Registry. This study follows up patients with CV<ORGANIZATION> diseases in Taiwan<GPE> who have secondary prevention therapies. The primary outcome is the time of first occurrence of a major adverse cardiac events ( MACEs<ORGANIZATION> ). 5388 patients with ASCVD<ORGANIZATION> were included and 1478 ( 27.4 % ) had CKD without dialysis. CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients had higher TG and lower LDL-C levels. The incidence of recurrent MACEs<ORGANIZATION> per 1000 person-years in CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients was 19.5 ( 95 % CI 15.5-24.9 ), compared with 9.1 ( 95 % CI 7.4-11.1 ) in non-CKD patients. In patients with statin therapy, there were no differences in MACE<ORGANIZATION> risk between each level of on-treatment LDL-C, TG<ORGANIZATION> and HDL-C level. Higher on-treatment non-HDL-C level was a significant predictor for higher MACE<ORGANIZATION> risk in patients without CKD<ORGANIZATION>, and borderline significant in CKD<ORGANIZATION> patients under statin therapy. Heart failure history was also associated with higher MACE<ORGANIZATION> risk in both group. Lower body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> < 23 kg/m In ASCVD<GPE> patients, on-treatment LDL-C was not a good CV outcome predictor. Instead, on-treatment non-HDL-C was a better predictor. Heart failure history was also associated with higher MACE<ORGANIZATION> risk in both group of patients. Lower BMI<ORGANIZATION> ( < 23 kg/m
