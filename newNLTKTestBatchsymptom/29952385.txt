 The low volatility of ionic liquids ( ILs<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of their most interesting physico-chemical properties ; however, the general understanding of their evaporation dynamics under vacuum is still lagging. Here, we studied the thermodynamics of IL<ORGANIZATION> evaporation by employing thermogravimetry ( TG ) measurements under vacuum. The thermodynamic parameters of ILs<ORGANIZATION>, such as the evaporation onset temperatures, enthalpies, entropies, saturation vapor pressures, and boiling points were quantified by analyzing the TG<ORGANIZATION> data. The obtained evaporation enthalpies ( 110-140 kJ mol-1 ) were higher than those of typical molecular liquids, and the entropies ( > 88 J mol-1 K-1 ) suggested that they are exceptions of the Trouton<GPE> 's rule. The obtained Clausius-Clapeyron equations demonstrated that the saturation vapor pressures of ILs<ORGANIZATION> only depend on temperature. Further, we derived the empirical equation for estimating the upper limit temperature of the liquid phase of IL<ORGANIZATION> under given external pressures. Using the evaporation behaviors of referential normal alkanes and charge-transfer complex and the evaporation entropies of the ILs<ORGANIZATION>, the vaporized IL structure was thermodynamically modelled. The ILs<ORGANIZATION> were found to evaporate as ion pairs, instead of as individual ions or higher-ordered cluster structures. By comparing a series of ILs<ORGANIZATION> with various cations and a fixed anion, it was found that the IL<ORGANIZATION> evaporation dynamics under vacuum is strongly and systematically affected by their chemical structures, charge balances between the cations and the anions, molecular weights, and the higher-ordered structures including polar and non-polar regions. Our concept, measurement method, and equation can be extended to other ILs<ORGANIZATION> and low-volatile liquids under vacuum, and help with the design of ILs<ORGANIZATION> with higher thermal stabilities.
