 Extending healthy lifespan is an emerging issue in an aging society. This study was designed to identify a dietary method of extending lifespan, promoting renoprotection, and preventing muscle weakness in aged mice, with a focus on the importance of the balance between dietary essential ( EAAs<ORGANIZATION> ) and nonessential amino acids ( NEAAs<ORGANIZATION> ) on the dietary restriction ( DR ) -induced antiaging effect. Groups of aged mice were fed ad libitum, a simple DR, or a DR with recovering NEAAs<ORGANIZATION> or EAAs<ORGANIZATION>. Simple DR<PERSON> significantly extended lifespan and ameliorated age-related kidney injury ; however, the beneficial effects of DR were canceled by recovering dietary EAA but not NEAA<ORGANIZATION>. Simple DR<PERSON> prevented the age-dependent decrease in slow-twitch<GPE> muscle fiber function but reduced absolute fast-twitch muscle fiber function. DR-induced fast-twitch muscle fiber dysfunction was improved by recovering either dietary NEAAs or EAAs<ORGANIZATION>. In the ad libitum-fed and the DR plus EAA<ORGANIZATION> groups, the renal content of methionine, an EAA<ORGANIZATION>, was significantly higher, accompanied by lower renal production of hydrogen sulfide ( H
