 Neurologic<GPE> complications are frequently seen in infective endocarditis ( IE ) and were identified in about 70 % of patients with IE<ORGANIZATION>. However, the imaging features of the cerebral septic infarction were less investigated. To demonstrate the imaging features of the cerebral septic infarction of IE<ORGANIZATION>. Two patients were clinically diagnosed as IE<ORGANIZATION> according to the modified Duke<PERSON> criterion. We studied their imaging profiles and reviewed the literature of the imaging features of neurologic complications of IE<ORGANIZATION>. The critical features are multiple ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions, most of which locate at the cortical-medullary junction. The septic infarctions are irregular patchy in shape and have characteristic imaging features indicating complications of IE<ORGANIZATION>. Magnetic<PERSON> resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) with different sequences can detect the features and provide clinical evidence to physicians to make the correct diagnoses and then the treatment plans.
