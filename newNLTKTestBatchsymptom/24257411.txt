 Economic<GPE> wealth and income inequality may impact on childhood BMI<ORGANIZATION> distribution by affecting overconsumption of food and sedentary forms of transportation and entertainment across the whole or some of the population. To determine whether BMI<ORGANIZATION> distribution of children differs by gross national income ( GNI<ORGANIZATION> ) per capita and Gini<PERSON> index derived from World Bank<ORGANIZATION> data. Secondary analysis of largely self-reported height and weight data from a multi-country, cross-sectional study ( ISAAC<ORGANIZATION> ), of 77,963 children aged 6-7 ( from 19 countries ) and 205,388 adolescents aged 13-14 ( from 36 countries ), were used to examine underweight vs obesity prevalence and BMI<ORGANIZATION> distribution skewness, median and dispersion. Children<PERSON> and adolescents from 'lower ' GNI<ORGANIZATION> countries had higher prevalence of underweight than those from 'higher ' GNI<ORGANIZATION> countries ( 6 % vs 3 %, It appears that the obesogenic impact of economic prosperity affects all children similarly. Income<PERSON> inequality may have a gender specific effect affecting BMI<ORGANIZATION> distribution in adolescent girls.
