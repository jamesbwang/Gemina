 We investigated early tumor shrinkage ( ETS<ORGANIZATION> ) and depth of response ( DpR<ORGANIZATION> ) using data from the G-SOX study comparing S-1 plus oxaliplatin with S-1 plus cisplatin as the first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer ( AGC<ORGANIZATION> ). ETS<ORGANIZATION> was determined as % decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions at the first evaluation of week 6 compared to baseline. DpR<ORGANIZATION> was the maximum % shrinkage during the study treatment. The impact of ETS<ORGANIZATION> ( cutoff value 20 % ) and DpR<ORGANIZATION> ( continuous value ) on progression-free survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) and overall survival ( OS ) were assessed by the log-rank test and Cox<PERSON> regression analysis including prognostic factors obtained in the G-SOX study ; ECOG<ORGANIZATION> performance status, baseline sum of tumor diameters, disease status ( recurrent/unresectable ), and histology ( diffuse/intestinal ). Among 685 patients enrolled in the G-SOX study, 632 patients who had the first tumor evaluation were analyzed. Patients with ETS<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 20 % had longer PFS<ORGANIZATION> ( median 4.5 vs. 2.8 months, p < 0.0001 ) and OS<ORGANIZATION> ( median 14.8 vs. 10.5 months, p < 0.0001 ) than those with ETS<ORGANIZATION> < 20 %. Adjusted hazard ratios of ETS<ORGANIZATION> < 20 vs. ≥ 20 % were 0.606 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.506-0.725 ) for PFS<ORGANIZATION> and 0.589 ( 95 % CI 0.492-0.704 ) for OS<ORGANIZATION>. DpR<ORGANIZATION> was also significantly associated with PFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS<ORGANIZATION> ( both p < 0.0001 ). These results were similar between the SOX<ORGANIZATION> and CS<ORGANIZATION> groups. In AGC<ORGANIZATION> patients receiving the first-line therapy, ETS<ORGANIZATION> and DpR<ORGANIZATION> might be predictors for PFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS<ORGANIZATION>.
