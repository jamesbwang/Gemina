 The Clean India<LOCATION> Mission is a national campaign that aims for complete elimination of open defecation from the country. In India<GPE>, 564 million people do not have access to toilets and defecate in the open environment. The 'Millennium development goals ' have given increased weightage to elimination of open defecation for improving health, nutrition and productivity of developing country populations. The Indian<GPE> economy bears an estimated annual total loss ( in terms of health, education, access time and tourism ) of US<GPE> $ 54 billion due to lack of toilets, poor hygiene and over US<GPE> $ 38.5 billion in treatment costs for diseases occurring due to poor hygiene. Out of 1415 human pathogens, at least more than 10 % of pathogens are transmitted through the faecal-oral route. The practice of open defecation helps pathogens persist in the environment and cause diseases. This review focuses on the current status and harms of open defecation, as well as the public and animal health benefits of implementing 'The Clean India<LOCATION> Mission ' in India<GPE>.
