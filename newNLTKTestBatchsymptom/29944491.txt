 Stressful<GPE> life events ( SLEs<ORGANIZATION> ) have been associated with adjustment problems in adolescence ( APA<ORGANIZATION> ) in cross-sectional studies. Using a longitudinal cohort, we examined the influence of these events and predefined covariates on APA<ORGANIZATION> and compared internalizing and externalizing trajectories among children with many versus few SLEs<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> were obtained from the Study of Early Child Care<PERSON> and Youth Development<PERSON>. One thousand three hundred sixty-four children and their families were followed from child 's birth until age 15 years. Adjustment problems at age 15 years were defined as high ( > 60 T-score ) internalizing and/or externalizing problems on the Youth<ORGANIZATION> Self-Report and Child Behavior Checklist<PERSON>. Stressful<PERSON> life events were evaluated at 54 months, and third and fifth grade. Categories created by mixture model analyses for covariates were used in logistic regressions to predict adjustment problems. Mothers<ORGANIZATION> reported higher rates of adjustment problems than adolescents ( 21.1 % vs 16.3 % ; p < 0.0001 ). Adjustment problems were associated with more SLEs<ORGANIZATION> ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.7 ; p = 0.0042 ), male sex ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.9 ; p = 0.001 ), child 's high emotional reactivity ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.6 ; p = 0.01 ), and paternal depression ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 2.1 ; p = 0.0165 ). Analysis using the mother 's report of adjustment problems showed the same predictors, as well as lower maternal education level ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 3.5 ; p = 0.0003 ), and child 's friendship quality ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.4 ; p = 0.005 ). Higher internalizing and externalizing T-scores were apparent in children with more SLEs from 2 years of age onward ( ps < 0.0001 ). After adjusting for multiple covariates, SLEs<ORGANIZATION> during childhood predicted adjustment problems. Our results suggest that emotional reactivity and paternal depression play a role in the development of APA<ORGANIZATION>.
