 Objectives The COU-AA-301 trial demonstrated that in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer using abiraterone post-docetaxel increased overall survival. This study aims to assess this conclusion in a real world context. Design Retrospective<PERSON> chart review of a provincial Pharmacy<ORGANIZATION> BDM Database ( a pharmacy dispensing software ) and a provincial Electronic<ORGANIZATION> Chart ( ARIA<ORGANIZATION> ). Dispensing data, information on the state of the disease before and after abiraterone use, and information regarding effects of abiraterone were gathered. Setting Cancer<GPE> centers in Alberta<GPE>, Canada<GPE>. Patients Metastatic<ORGANIZATION> castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC<ORGANIZATION> ) patients on abiraterone outside of a clinical trial who have previously had docetaxel chemotherapy for CRPC<ORGANIZATION> between February 2012 and May 2014. Primary outcome Overall survival from the time of abiraterone initiation. Results<PERSON> Overall survival increase of 17 months was consistent with the survival increase of 14.8 months observed in the pivotal trial. Conclusion Abiraterone is a valuable therapy post-docetaxel for metastatic CRPC<ORGANIZATION>, as in a real world context it demonstrated an increase in overall survival that was consistent with the findings of the clinical trial despite including a patient population of older age and lower performance status.
