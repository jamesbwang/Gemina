 The objective was to analyze whether socioeconomic factors related to the context and those related to the model of care-specifically the coverage of primary care by the Family Health Strategy<ORGANIZATION> ( ESF<ORGANIZATION> ) -had an impact on hospitalizations due to heart failure ( HF ) and stroke, in the State of São<ORGANIZATION> Paulo/Brazil between 1998 and 2013. A longitudinal ecological study involving 645 municipalities was conducted in the state of São<ORGANIZATION> Paulo/Brazil from 1998 to 2013, using the Hospital Information System<ORGANIZATION> ( SIH-DataSUS database ). The hospitalizations for primary care sensitive conditions: Stroke<PERSON> and heart failure ( HF ) that correspond to the International Classification<ORGANIZATION> of Diseases<GPE> ( ICD<ORGANIZATION> 10 ): I50, I63<PERSON> to I67<GPE> ; I69<PERSON>, G45<PERSON> to G46<PERSON> were analyzed longitudinally during the period indicated regarding the percentage of people covered by the Family Health Program<ORGANIZATION> ( PSF<ORGANIZATION> ) adjusted for confounders ( population size, gross domestic product -GDP and human development index- HDI ). There was a significant decrease in the number of hospitalizations for heart failure and stroke per 10000 ( inhabitants ) in the period ( p < 0.0001 ), with a significant relationship with increased proportion of ESF<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.0001 ), and this remained significant even when possible confounders ( population size, GDP<ORGANIZATION> and HDI<ORGANIZATION> ) were included in the model ( p < 0.0001 ). GDP per capita was close to or higher than that if many European<GPE> countries, which shows the relevance of the study. The health care model based on the Family Health Strategy<ORGANIZATION> positively impacted hospitalization indicators for heart failure and stroke, indicating that this model is effective in the prevention of primary care sensitive conditions.
