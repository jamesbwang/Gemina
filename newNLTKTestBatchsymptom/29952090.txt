 We investigated which patients with heart failure ( HF ) should receive specialist palliative care ( SPC<ORGANIZATION> ) by first creating a definition of need for SPC<ORGANIZATION> in patients hospitalised with HF using patient-reported outcome measures ( PROMs<ORGANIZATION> ) and then testing this definition using the outcome of days alive and out of hospital ( DAOH<ORGANIZATION> ). We also evaluated which baseline variables predicted need for SPC<ORGANIZATION> and whether those with this need received SPC<ORGANIZATION>. PROMs assessing quality of life ( QoL<ORGANIZATION> ), symptoms, and mood were administered at baseline and every 4 months. SPC<ORGANIZATION> need was defined as persistently severe impairment of any PROM without improvement ( or severe impairment immediately preceding death ). We then tested whether need for SPC<ORGANIZATION>, so defined, was reflected in DAOH<GPE>, a measure which combines length of stay, days of hospital re-admission, and days lost due to death. Of 272 patients recruited, 74 ( 27 % ) met the definition of SPC<ORGANIZATION> needs. These patients lived one third fewer DAOH than those without SPC<ORGANIZATION> need ( and less than a quarter of QoL-adjusted DAOH ). A Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire<ORGANIZATION> ( KCCQ<ORGANIZATION> ) summary score of < 29 identified patients who subsequently had SPC<ORGANIZATION> needs ( area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.78 ). Twenty-four per cent of patients with SPC<ORGANIZATION> needs actually received SPC<ORGANIZATION> ( n = 18 ). A quarter of patients hospitalised with HF<ORGANIZATION> had a need for SPC<ORGANIZATION> and were identified by a low KCCQ<ORGANIZATION> score on admission. Those with SPC<ORGANIZATION> need spent many fewer DAOH<ORGANIZATION> and their DAOH were of significantly worse quality. Very few patients with SPC<ORGANIZATION> needs accessed SPC<ORGANIZATION> services.
