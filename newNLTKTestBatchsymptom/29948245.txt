 Dimethyl-fumarate ( DMF<ORGANIZATION> ) demonstrated efficacy and safety in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( MS ) in randomized clinical trials. To track and evaluate post-market DMF<ORGANIZATION> profile in real-world setting. Patients receiving DMF<ORGANIZATION> referred to Italian<GPE> MS centres were enrolled and prospectively followed, collecting demographic clinical and radiological data. Among the 735 included patients, 45.4 % were naïve to disease-modifying therapies, 17.8 % switched to DMF<ORGANIZATION> because of tolerance, 27.4 % switched to DMF<ORGANIZATION> because of lack of efficacy, and 9.4 % switched to DMF<ORGANIZATION> because of safety concerns. Median DMF<PERSON> exposure was 17 months ( 0-33 ). DMF<ORGANIZATION> reduced the annual relapse rate ( ARR<ORGANIZATION> ) by 63.2 %. At 12 and 24 months, 85 and 76 % of patients were relapse-free. NEDA-3 status after 12 months of DMF<ORGANIZATION> treatment was maintained by 47.5 % of patients. 89 and 70 % of patients at 12 and 24 months regularly continued DMF<ORGANIZATION>. Most frequent adverse events ( AEs<ORGANIZATION> ) were flushing ( 37.2 % ) and gastro-enteric AEs<ORGANIZATION> ( 31.1 % ). Our post-market study corroborated that DMF<ORGANIZATION> is a safe and effective drug. Additionally, the study suggested that naïve patients strongly benefit from DMF<ORGANIZATION> and that DMF<ORGANIZATION> improved ARR<ORGANIZATION> also in patients who were horizontally switched from injectable therapies due to tolerability and efficacy issues.
