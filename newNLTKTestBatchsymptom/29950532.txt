 proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) is an advanced form of DR that eventually could lead to blindness. Levels<PERSON> of vitreous advanced glycation end products ( AGEs<ORGANIZATION> ) and D-dimer may reflect the pathological changes in the retina, but only few studies have assessed their correlation with blood hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> ) levels. This study aimed to find the association between blood HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> levels with vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION> and D-dimer levels in patients with proliferative DR. an analytical cross-sectional study was performed in subjects with proliferative DR who underwent vitrectomy. Subjects were divided into 2 subgroups, i.e. uncontrolled ( HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> > 7 % ) and controlled ( HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> < 7 % ) groups. Vitreous AGEs<PERSON> and D-dimer levels were assessed ; the levels were compared between uncontrolled and controlled hyperglycemic patients. Statistic correlation tests were also performed for evaluating blood HbA1c<ORGANIZATION>, vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION>, and D-dimer levels. a total of 47 patients were enrolled in this study and 32 ( 68.1 % ) of them were women. Median<GPE> vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION> level was 11.0 ( 3.0 - 48.0 ) Âµg/mL ; whereas median vitreous D-dimers level was 5,446.0 ( 44.0 - 37,394.0 ) ng/mL. The median vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION> levels was significantly higher in patients with uncontrolled vs. controlled hyperglycemia ( 14.0 vs. 4.0 mg/mL ; p < 0.001 ). There was a significant positive correlation with moderate strength between blood HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> level and vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION> level ( r=0.524 ; r2=0.130 ; p=0.0001 ). Blood HbA1c<PERSON> level could be used to predict vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION> level by using the following calculation: vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION> = -1.442+ ( 1.740xblood HbA1c ). Vitreous D-dimer levels were not significantly different between uncontrolled and controlled hyperglycemia ( median 4607.5 vs. 5701.6 ng/mL ; p = 0.458 ). There was a positive significant correlation between blood HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> and vitreous D-dimer levels ( r = 0.342 ; p = 0.019 ) ; however the correlation was weak. Vitreous AGEs<PERSON> level had a positive significant correlation with vitreous D-dimer levels ( r = 0.292 ; p = 0.046 ) and the correlation strength was also weak. median vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION> levels were significantly higher in proliferative DR patients with uncontrolled than those with controlled hyperglycemia. Blood HbA1c<PERSON> level can be used to assess vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION> level in patients with proliferative DR by using the following calculation: vitreous AGEs<ORGANIZATION> = -1.442+ ( 1.740 x HbA1c ). However, the blood HbA1c<ORGANIZATION> level can not be used to predict vitreous D-dimer level in patients with proliferative DR.
