 This prospective study of an innovative non-invasive ultrasonic cerebrovascular autoregulation ( CA ) monitoring method is based on real-time measurements of intracranial blood volume ( IBV<ORGANIZATION> ) reactions following changes in arterial blood pressure. In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical applicability of a non-invasive CA monitoring method by performing a prospective comparative clinical study of simultaneous invasive and non-invasive CA monitoring on intensive care patients. CA was monitored in 61 patients with severe traumatic brain injuries invasively by calculating the pressure reactivity index ( PRx<ORGANIZATION> ) and non-invasively by calculating the volumetric reactivity index ( VRx<ORGANIZATION> ) simultaneously. The PRx<ORGANIZATION> was calculated as a moving correlation coefficient between intracranial pressure and arterial blood pressure slow waves. The VRx<ORGANIZATION> was calculated as a moving correlation coefficient between arterial blood pressure and non-invasively-measured IBV<ORGANIZATION> slow waves. A linear regression between VRx<ORGANIZATION> and PRx<ORGANIZATION> averaged per patients ' monitoring session showed a significant correlation ( r = 0.843, p < 0.001 ; 95 % confidence interval 0.751 - 0.903 ). The standard deviation of the difference between VRx<ORGANIZATION> and PRx<ORGANIZATION> was 0.192 ; bias was - 0.065. This prospective clinical study of the non-invasive ultrasonic volumetric reactivity index VRx<ORGANIZATION> monitoring, based on ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements of IBV<ORGANIZATION> dynamics, showed significant coincidence of non-invasive VRx<ORGANIZATION> index with invasive PRx<ORGANIZATION> index. The ultrasonic time-of-flight method reflects blood volume changes inside the acoustic path, which crosses both hemispheres of the brain. This method does not reflect locally and invasively-recorded intracranial pressure slow waves, but the autoregulatory reactions of both hemispheres of the brain. Therefore, VRx<ORGANIZATION> can be used as a non-invasive cerebrovascular autoregulation index in the same way as PRx<ORGANIZATION> and can also provide information about the CA<ORGANIZATION> status encompassing all intracranial hemodynamics.
