 Administration<ORGANIZATION> of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs<ORGANIZATION> ) is frequently accompanied by severe first infusion reactions ( FIR<ORGANIZATION> ). The mechanism driving FIR<ORGANIZATION> is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms causing FIR<ORGANIZATION> in humanized mouse models and their potential for evaluating FIR<ORGANIZATION> risk in patients. Mice<PERSON> humanized for Fc gamma receptors ( FcγRs<ORGANIZATION> ) were generated by recombination-mediated genomic replacement. Body temperature, cytokine release and reactive oxygen species ( ROS<ORGANIZATION> ) were measured to assess FIR<ORGANIZATION> to mAbs. Infusion of human mAb<ORGANIZATION> specific for mouse transferrin receptor ( HamTfR<ORGANIZATION> ) into FcγR-humanized mice, produced marked transient hypothermia accompanied by an increase in inflammatory cytokines KC and MIP-2, and ROS<ORGANIZATION>. FIR were dependent on administration route and Fc-triggered effector functions mediated by neutrophils. Human<PERSON> neutrophils also induced FIR in wild type mice infused with HamTfR<ORGANIZATION>. Specific knock-in mice demonstrated that human FcγRIIIb<ORGANIZATION> on neutrophils was both necessary and sufficient to cause FIR<ORGANIZATION>. FcγRIIIb-mediated FIR<ORGANIZATION> was abolished by depleting neutrophils or blocking FcγRIIIb<ORGANIZATION> with CD11b<ORGANIZATION> antibodies. Human FcγRIIIb<PERSON> and neutrophils are primarily responsible for triggering FIR<ORGANIZATION>. Clinical<PERSON> strategies to prevent FIR<ORGANIZATION> in patients should focus on this pathway and may include transient depletion of neutrophils or blocking FcγRIIIb<ORGANIZATION> with specific mAbs<ORGANIZATION>.
