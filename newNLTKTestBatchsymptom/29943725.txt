 The efficacies of 3-day regimens of artemether-lumefantrine ( AL<ORGANIZATION> ), artesunate-amodiaquine ( AA ), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHP<ORGANIZATION> ) were evaluated in 910 children < 5 years old with uncomplicated malaria from six geographical areas of Nigeria<GPE>. Parasite<ORGANIZATION> positivity 1 day and Kaplan-Meier estimated risk of persistent parasitemia 3 days after therapy initiation were both significantly higher, and geometric mean parasite reduction ratio 1 day after treatment initiation ( PRRD1<ORGANIZATION> ) was significantly lower in AL-treated children than in AA- and DHP-treated children. No history of fever, temperature > 38°C, enrollment parasitemia > 75,000 μL
