 Some patients diagnosed as immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP<ORGANIZATION> ) have poor response to common first-line therapy such as corticosteroid and immunoglobulin. Studies in recent years have found a FC-independent platelet clearance pathway exists, which is characterized by desialylation of platelet surface glycoprotein ( GP ), recognition and phagocytosis by Ashwell-Morell<ORGANIZATION> receptor ( AMR<ORGANIZATION> ) on hepatocytes, independent on Fc receptors of the reticuloendothelial system. The up-regulation of neuraminidase-1 ( Neu1 ) expression on platelet caused by various factors, such as cold storage of platelet, septicemia and ITP<ORGANIZATION> could desialylate GPs<ORGANIZATION>. It has been found that ITP<ORGANIZATION> with positive anti-GPIbα antibody mostly has a poor response to first-line therapy and indicated that such antibody may lead to FC-independent platelet clearance. It also has been proved that anti-GPIbα antibody could desialylate GPs<ORGANIZATION> on platelet in animal experiments. Researchers have tris to use sialidase inhibitor agent to treat ITP<ORGANIZATION> and got a persistent response of platelet. Here, the desialylation of platelet and its role in ITP<ORGANIZATION> pathogensis and therapy are reviewed.
