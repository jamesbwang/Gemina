 Loss<GPE> of function of the DIS3L2<ORGANIZATION> exoribonuclease is associated with Wilms<PERSON> tumor and the Perlman<ORGANIZATION> congenital overgrowth syndrome. LIN28, a Wilms tumor oncoprotein, triggers the DIS3L2-mediated degradation of the precursor of let-7, a microRNA<ORGANIZATION> that inhibits Wilms<PERSON> tumor development. These observations have led to speculation that DIS3L2-mediated tumor suppression is attributable to let-7 regulation. Here we examine new DIS3L2-deficient cell lines and mouse models, demonstrating that DIS3L2<ORGANIZATION> loss has no effect on mature let-7 levels. Rather, analysis of
