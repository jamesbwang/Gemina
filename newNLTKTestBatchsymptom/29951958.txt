 Consensus<GSP> on appropriate outcome measures to use in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH<ORGANIZATION> ) research has not been established, although the transition toward a core outcome set ( COS<ORGANIZATION> ) would provide significant benefits. To inform COS<ORGANIZATION> development, we conducted a systematic review to identify outcome measures included in reports of randomized clinical trials ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) of interventions in patients with aSAH<ORGANIZATION>. Ovid Medline<PERSON>, EMBASE<ORGANIZATION>, CINAHL<ORGANIZATION>, and CENTRAL<ORGANIZATION> were searched. RCTs investigating aSAH published between January 1996 and May 2015 were included. The primary and secondary outcomes of RCTs<ORGANIZATION> were recorded and classified according to the OMERACT Consortium<ORGANIZATION> 's framework. We identified 1093 potential studies of which 129 met inclusion criteria representing 24 238 patients. There were 285 unique outcome measures. The Glasgow Outcome Scale<ORGANIZATION> ( GOS<ORGANIZATION> ) was the most frequently used primary outcome ( 13/129, 10.1 % ). Mortality was reported in 84 trials ( 65.1 % ) with 3 months the most common time point ( 34/129, 26.4 % ). The GOS<ORGANIZATION> ( 65/129, 50.4 % ) and the Modified Rankin Scale<ORGANIZATION> ( 51/129, 39.5 % ) were the most commonly reported functional measures ; however, these were reported at different time points and often dichotomized using different ranges. Patient-reported quality of life measures were used in 11 trials ( 8.5 % ). Transcranial Doppler<PERSON> was the most frequently used imaging modality ( 40/129, 31.0 % ). Definitions and reporting of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia and imaging modality results were highly variable. The marked heterogeneity of outcomes in reports of RCTs<ORGANIZATION> supports the development of a core outcome set for aSAH<ORGANIZATION> trials. Our study has identified a wide range of outcomes for potential inclusion in a future aSAH COS<ORGANIZATION>.
