 The ClinVar<ORGANIZATION> database is a useful tool for patients and physicians to view variant interpretations submitted by clinical and non-clinical labs. However, variants of uncertain significance ( VUS<ORGANIZATION> ) in ClinVar<ORGANIZATION> can pose a significant burden on patients. If possible, it is important to resolve discrepancies and uncertainties surrounding interpreted variants. Here we highlight a case of a family who received a report of a variant ( c.622A > G, p.Ile208Val ) in BRAF<ORGANIZATION> following prenatal RASopathy<ORGANIZATION> testing. The variant had been previously classified by our laboratory as a VUS<ORGANIZATION>, so the mother contacted our lab via ClinVar<ORGANIZATION> for further information which prompted re-evaluation of the variant. Multiple sources of case-level data as well as the presence of the variant in the general population yielded sufficient evidence to reclassify the variant as likely benign. This reclassification alleviated significant concern for the family, and the child was born healthy with no clinical manifestations of Noonan<GPE> syndrome or a RASopathy<ORGANIZATION>.
