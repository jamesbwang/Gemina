 The replisome must overcome DNA<ORGANIZATION> damage to ensure complete chromosome replication. Here, we describe the earliest events in this process by reconstituting collisions between a eukaryotic replisome, assembled with purified proteins, and DNA<ORGANIZATION> damage. Lagging-strand lesions are bypassed without delay, leaving daughter-strand gaps roughly the size of an Okazaki fragment. In contrast, leading-strand polymerase stalling significantly impacts replication fork progression. We reveal that the core replisome itself can bypass leading-strand damage by re-priming synthesis beyond it. Surprisingly, this restart activity is rare, mainly due to inefficient leading-strand re-priming, rather than single-stranded DNA<ORGANIZATION> exposure or primer extension. We find several unanticipated mechanistic distinctions between leading- and lagging-strand priming that we propose control the replisome 's initial response to DNA<ORGANIZATION> damage. Notably, leading-strand restart was specifically stimulated by RPA<ORGANIZATION> depletion, which can occur under conditions of replication stress. Our results have implications for pathway choice at stalled forks and priming at DNA<ORGANIZATION> replication origins.
