 Doxorubicin<GPE> ( DOX<ORGANIZATION> ) is a chemotherapy agent widely used in clinical practice, and it is very efficient in tumor suppression, but the use of DOX<ORGANIZATION> is limited by a strong association with the development of severe muscle atrophy and cardiotoxicity effects. Reversion or neutralization of the muscular atrophy can lead to a better prognosis. Recent studies have proposed that the negative effect of DOX<ORGANIZATION> on skeletal muscle is linked to its inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPk<ORGANIZATION> ), a key mediator of cellular metabolism. On the basis of this, our goal was to evaluate if aerobic exercise or metformin treatment, activators of AMPk<ORGANIZATION>, would be able to attenuate the deleterious effects on skeletal muscle induced by the DOX<ORGANIZATION> treatment. C57BL6<ORGANIZATION> mice received either saline ( control ) or DOX<ORGANIZATION> ( 2.5 mg/kg body weight ) intraperitoneally, twice a week. The animals on DOX<ORGANIZATION> were further divided into groups that received adjuvant treatment in the form of moderate aerobic physical exercise ( DOX+T ) or metformin gavage ( 300 mg/body weight/day ). Body<PERSON> weight, metabolism, distance run, muscle fiber cross-sectional area ( CSA<ORGANIZATION> ), and protein synthesis and degradation were assessed. We demonstrated that aerobic training, but not metformin, associated with DOX<ORGANIZATION> increased the maximal aerobic capacity without changing muscle mass or fiber CSA<ORGANIZATION>, rescuing the muscle fatigue observed with DOX<ORGANIZATION> treatment alone. This improvement was associated with AMPk<ORGANIZATION> activation, thus surpassing the negative effects of DOX<ORGANIZATION> on muscle performance and bioenergetics. In conclusion, aerobic exercise increases AMPk<ORGANIZATION> activation and improved the skeletal muscle function, reducing the side effects of DOX<ORGANIZATION>.
