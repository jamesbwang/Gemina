 Although organ-preserving operations are regarded as effective strategies for duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs<ORGANIZATION> ), laparoscopic partial sleeve duodenectomy ( lap PSD ) has not been fully evaluated. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness and technical feasibility of lap PSD<ORGANIZATION>. Between<PERSON> January 2011 and March 2016, we reviewed 13 patients who underwent laparoscopic approach among 22 patients who underwent PSD<ORGANIZATION>. PSD<ORGANIZATION> for the infra-ampullary lesions was defined as infra-ampullary duodenal resection including the first portion of the jejunum. After resection, all patients underwent reconstruction via side-to-side duodenojejunostomy. The total mean operation time was 273 min ( range 160-346 min ), and estimated mean blood loss was 80 ml ( range scanty-200 ml ). One patient was converted to open laparotomy because of mesocolonic tumor involvement. The median postoperative hospital stay was 10.5 days ( range 4-36 days ). There were no postoperative mortalities. Postoperative complications included 2 instances of delayed gastric emptying ( DGE<ORGANIZATION> ), 1 duodenojejunostomy stricture, and 2 intestinal obstructions. No patient was treated with adjuvant therapy. One patient experienced hepatic metastasis 28 months after surgery during a mean follow-up period of 48.6 months. Lap PSD<PERSON> might be an oncologically effective strategy for duodenal GIST<ORGANIZATION>, and the laparoscopic approach is a technically feasible and appealing surgical modality in terms of safety and perioperative results. However, DGE<ORGANIZATION> and anastomosis strictures are concerns for postoperative complications, which need to be further investigated.
