 Despite advancements in the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer, many patients lack a durable response to these treatments. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC<ORGANIZATION> ) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2<ORGANIZATION> ) -positive breast cancer who do not have a pathological complete response ( pCR<ORGANIZATION> ) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT<ORGANIZATION> ) have a very poor prognosis. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs<ORGANIZATION> ) have been identified as a predictive marker for pCR<ORGANIZATION> after NACT<ORGANIZATION> in TNBC<ORGANIZATION> and HER2-positive breast cancer. These patient populations could also be suitable for novel treatment strategies including neoepitope-based therapies. This work analyses the effect of TILs<ORGANIZATION> on the pCR<ORGANIZATION> in neoadjuvantly treated patients in the TILGen<ORGANIZATION> study and presents the procedures aimed at establishing neoepitope-based therapies in this study. Neoadjuvantly treated HER2-positive and TNBC<ORGANIZATION> patients were eligible for the presented analysis concerning the association between TILs<ORGANIZATION> and pCR<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 146 patients could be identified within the TILGen<ORGANIZATION> study. TILs<ORGANIZATION> were evaluated as percentage of stromal tumor tissue in core biopsies at primary diagnosis. The phenotype 'lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer ' ( LPBC<ORGANIZATION> ) was associated with pCR<ORGANIZATION> by logistic regression adjusted for estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, HER2<ORGANIZATION> status, age at diagnosis, and grading. LPBC<ORGANIZATION> was seen in 24 ( 16.4 % ) patients. In this patient group, 66.7 % achieved a pCR<ORGANIZATION>, while the pCR<ORGANIZATION> rate was 32.8 % in patients with a low TIL<ORGANIZATION> count. The adjusted odds ratio was 6.60 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.02-21.56 ; p < 0.01 ). TILs are a strong predictor of pCR<ORGANIZATION> in TNBC<ORGANIZATION> and HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Implications for the use of this information including the effect on prognosis might help to identify patients most likely to benefit from a neoepitope-based therapy approach.
