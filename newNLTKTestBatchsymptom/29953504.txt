 Neutrophil<GPE> functions have long been regarded as limited to acute inflammation and the defense against microbes. The role ( s ) of neutrophils in cancer remain poorly understood. Neutrophils infiltrate tumors and are key effector cells in the orchestration of inflammatory responses. Thyroid<PERSON> cancer ( TC ) is the most recurrent endocrine malignant tumor and is responsible for 70 % of deaths due to endocrine cancers. No studies are so far available on the role of neutrophils in TC. Our purpose was to study the involvement of tumor-associated neutrophils in TC. Highly<PERSON> purified human neutrophils ( > 99 % ) from healthy donors were stimulated in vitro with conditioned media derived from TC<ORGANIZATION> cell lines TPC1<ORGANIZATION> and 8505c ( TC-CMs ). Neutrophil functions ( e.g., chemotaxis, activation, plasticity, survival, gene expression, and protein release ) were evaluated. TC-derived soluble factors promoted neutrophil chemotaxis and survival. Neutrophil<PERSON> chemotaxis toward a TC-CM was mediated, at least in part, by CXCL8/IL-8, and survival was mediated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ). In addition, each TC-CM induced morphological changes and activation of neutrophils ( e.g., CD11b<ORGANIZATION> and CD66b<ORGANIZATION> upregulation and CD62L<ORGANIZATION> shedding ) and modified neutrophils ' kinetic properties. Furthermore, each TC-CM induced production of reactive oxygen species, expression of proinflammatory and angiogenic mediators ( CXCL8/IL-8, VEGF-A, and TNF-α ), and a release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ). Moreover, in TC patients, tumor-associated neutrophils correlated with larger tumor size. TC cell lines produce soluble factors able to `` educate '' neutrophils toward an activated functional state. These data will advance the understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of innate immunity in TC.
