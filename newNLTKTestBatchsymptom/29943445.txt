 Site-independent ratings surveillance assessed ratings reliability in a clinical trial. Inter-rater reliability was assessed at the screen visit in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of lurasidone for the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD<ORGANIZATION> ) with subthreshold hypomanic ( `` mixed '' ) symptoms ( clinicaltrials.gov NCT01421134 ). Site-based Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS<ORGANIZATION> ) and Young Mania Rating Scale<PERSON> ( YMRS<ORGANIZATION> ) interviews were paired with 184 site-independent ratings derived from audio-digital recordings. The paired MADRS<ORGANIZATION> and YMRS<ORGANIZATION> scores were highly correlated ( r = 0.708 and 0.885, respectively ) and generated minimal scoring discordance. The surveillance program identified 14 MADRS scores ( 7.6 % of this sample ) that were below the study entry criterion ( MADRS<ORGANIZATION> ≥26 ) and resulted in screen failure. When present, paired scoring discordance was associated with symptom severity, interview length, interview quality, and the level of patient cooperation. Higher severity scores ( MADRS<ORGANIZATION> ≥40 and YMRS<ORGANIZATION> ≥15 ) were associated with greater paired scoring discordance. Further<PERSON>, MADRS<ORGANIZATION> scores < 30 and short MADRS<ORGANIZATION> interviews conducted in ≤12 min revealed significantly more pairs of discordant outliers ( p = 0.04 and 0.009, respectively ). The findings suggest that MDD<ORGANIZATION> patients with mixed features can be reliably assessed, that paired site-based and site-independent assessments were generally concordant, and that ratings surveillance may reinforce ratings precision.
