 Haemodynamic<GPE> follow up in pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH<ORGANIZATION> ) is currently based on right heart catheterisation ( RHC<ORGANIZATION> ). The primary objective of the EVITA<ORGANIZATION> study is to compare the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( cMRI<ORGANIZATION> ) with RHC<ORGANIZATION> in the identification of an unfavourable hemodynamic status. The secondary objectives are to determine the role of cMRI<ORGANIZATION> in the follow up process. Patients<PERSON> will undergo at diagnosis and at follow up visits both RHC<ORGANIZATION> and cMRI<ORGANIZATION>. Patients<PERSON> will be followed and treated according to the current guidelines. The primary endpoint will be an unfavourable haemodynamic status defined by cardiac index < 2.5L/min/m
