 Chemokines are known to play a vital role in guiding and regulating the immune response to viral infections. The chemokine CXC<ORGANIZATION> subfamily is a major subfamily in the chemokine family. Outcomes of hepatitis C virus ( HCV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection, as well as the response to treatment, depend on virus and host factors. Here we recruited chronic hepatitis C ( CHC<ORGANIZATION> ) patients to perform an association study between three single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs<ORGANIZATION> ) ( CXCR2<ORGANIZATION> rs1126579, CXCL10<ORGANIZATION> rs8878 and CXCL10<ORGANIZATION> rs3921 ) and HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection outcomes and treatment responses among a Chinese<GPE> population, using primarily a TaqMan<ORGANIZATION> assay. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the influencing factors on HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection outcome and treatment response. The results showed that subjects with the CXCR2<ORGANIZATION> rs1126579 TT genotype had a significantly increased possibility of HCV<ORGANIZATION> spontaneous clearance ( Dominant<ORGANIZATION> model: adjusted OR = 1.32, 95 % CI = 1.06-1.64 ; P<PERSON> = 0.013 ). Additionally, CHC<ORGANIZATION> patients carrying the CXCR2<ORGANIZATION> rs1126579 TT genotype were also more likely to achieve a sustained virological response ( SVR<ORGANIZATION> ) ( Dominant<ORGANIZATION> model: adjusted OR = 0.49, 95 % CI = 0.29-0.84 ; P<PERSON> = 0.010 ). We also established a predictive model for HCV<ORGANIZATION> treatment response including the CXCR2<ORGANIZATION> rs1126579 SNP<ORGANIZATION> status, albumin ( ALB<ORGANIZATION> ) levels and baseline HCV<ORGANIZATION> RNA levels, which produced an area under the curve ( AUC<ORGANIZATION> ) of about 0.660. These findings highlight that variant CXCR2<ORGANIZATION> rs1126579 genotypes are associated with HCV<ORGANIZATION> clearance within the Chinese<GPE> population.
