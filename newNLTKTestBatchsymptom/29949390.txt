 We investigated whether there was a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment ( CI ) and/or physical frailty ( PF ) in persons with diabetes compared to their non-diabetic counterparts, and the individual and combined impact of CI<ORGANIZATION> and PF<ORGANIZATION> on functional and mortality outcomes among diabetic older persons. Method<PERSON> Community-living diabetic and non-diabetic participants ( N=2696 ) aged 55 and above were assessed on CI ( MMSE<ORGANIZATION> ) and PF<ORGANIZATION> ( CHS<ORGANIZATION> criteria ) status. Among 486 diabetic persons, we estimated the odds ratio and 95 % confidence intervals ( OR<ORGANIZATION>, 95 % CI ) of association of CI<ORGANIZATION> and/or PF with prevalent IADL<ORGANIZATION> and ADL<ORGANIZATION> disability and mortality from 11 years of follow up. Results Diabetes<PERSON> was associated with significantly higher prevalence of CI<ORGANIZATION> and/or PF. Adjusted for sex, age, education, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and BMI<ORGANIZATION>, diabetes was associated with higher prevalence of PF<ORGANIZATION> alone ( OR=2.24, 1.16-4.34 ) and PF with CI<ORGANIZATION> ( OR=2.01, 1.12-3.60 ), but not with CI<ORGANIZATION> alone ( OR=1.02, 0.73-1.44 ). In multivariable analyses of 486 diabetic older adults, compared to non-frail ( NF ) and cognitive normal ( CN ), CI<ORGANIZATION> alone was not significantly associated with IADL<ORGANIZATION> ( OR=1.06, 0.53-2.10 ), but PF alone was associated with considerably higher prevalence of IADL<ORGANIZATION> ( OR=6.72, 1.84-24.5 ). PF with CI<ORGANIZATION> was associated with the highest prevalence of IADL<ORGANIZATION> ( OR=17.8, 3.66-8.68 ) and ADL<ORGANIZATION> disability ( OR=93.8, 23.6-372.4 ). Whether singly or in combination, PF and/or CI were associated with worse hazard ( HR ) ratio for mortality outcomes: CI alone ( HR=2.72, 1.48-5.01 ), PF<ORGANIZATION> alone ( HR=4.30, 1.88-9.82 ) and CI with PF<ORGANIZATION> ( HR=8.41, 3.95-17.9 ). Cognitive impairment and/or physical frailty are powerful prognostic factors identifying people with diabetes at high risk of mortality.
