 Chest<GPE> tube drainage with fibrinolytics is a cost-effective treatment option for parapneumonic effusion and empyema in children. Although the additional use of ultrasound ( US<ORGANIZATION> ) guidance is recommended, this is rarely performed in real time to direct drain insertion. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of real-time US-guided, radiologically placed chest drains at a tertiary university hospital. This was a retrospective review over a 16-year period of all children with parapneumonic effusion or empyema undergoing percutaneous US-guided drainage at our centre. Three hundred and three drains were placed in 285 patients. Treatment<PERSON> was successful in 93 % of patients after a single drain ( 98.2 % success with 2 or 3 drains ). Five children had peri-insertion complications, but none was significant. The success rate improved with experience. Although five patients required surgical intervention, all children treated since 2012 were successfully treated with single-tube drainage only and none has required surgery. Our technique for inserting small-bore ( â‰¤8.5 F ) catheter drains under US<GSP> guidance is effective and appears to be a safe procedure for first-line management of complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema.
