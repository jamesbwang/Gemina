 Beryllate<GPE> structures are marginally investigated, but show intriguing structural relations to oxo- and nitridosilicates. A typical feature is the coordination of Be both in trigonal planar and tetrahedral coordination by O. A broad range of structures is accessible by variable combinations of both building units. Three novel ternary Sr-oxoberyllates are characterized by single-crystal<ORGANIZATION> X-ray diffraction analysis, density functional theory calculations and investigations on luminescence properties: α-SrBeO2, β-SrBeO2 and Sr12Be17O29 are obtained with oxoberyllate substructures made up of either BeO3 triangles or BeO4<ORGANIZATION> tetrahedra. The compounds can be described as chain- and layer-type beryllates. When excited with blue light of ( In, Ga<GPE> ) N LED chips β-SrBeO2 and Sr12Be17O29<GPE> show visible emission in the yellow and orange spectral range, respectively, upon doping with Eu2+. Exceptional narrow-band yellow emission ( λem = 564 nm, fwhm = 55 nm ) make SrBeO2<ORGANIZATION>: Eu2+ a promising phosphor for application in phosphor converted ( pc- ) LEDs<ORGANIZATION>.
