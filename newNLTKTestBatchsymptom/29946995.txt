 We report a case of subcutaneous infection caused by Exophiala<PERSON> oligosperma. Erythematous ulcerated plaque with exudate was major clinical features. Histopathological examination showed yeast-like cells and fungal hyphae. Mycological<PERSON> and molecular identification revealed E. oligosperma as etiologic agent. Local<PERSON> debridement and oral itraconazole were effective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of phaeohyphomycosis caused by E. oligosperma in mainland China<GPE>. This report highlights the potential role of E. oligosperma as an emerging cause of infection in immunocompetent patients.
