 Results to date suggest that microalgal Thraustochytrids family strains can be used to produce high-functional omega-3 rich oil ( ~ 30-70 % of dry cell weight ) and carotenoid-based antioxidant pigments simultaneously with value-added bioactive potential. In the present study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a new Thraustochytrid Schizochytrium sp. from the west coastal area of Korea<GPE>. This newly isolated Thraustochytrid<GPE>, identified as Schizochytrium<PERSON> sp. through 18S rRNA analysis and named SH104<ORGANIZATION>, simultaneously produces high levels of DHA<ORGANIZATION> and carotenoid-based antioxidant pigments. An improved Schizochytrium mutant, named SHG104<ORGANIZATION>, was obtained from the original host strain by Î³-irradiation-induced mutagenesis. Under combined temperature-shift cultivation conditions employing white-light LEDs<ORGANIZATION> ( light-emitting diodes ), Schizochytrium<PERSON> sp. SHG104<ORGANIZATION> yielded 10.8 g L
