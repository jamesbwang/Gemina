 Sarcoidosis<GPE> is believed to be caused by both genetic and environmental risk factors, but the proportion of the susceptibility to sarcoidosis which is mediated by genetics remains unknown. We aimed to estimate the familial aggregation and heritability of sarcoidosis using a case-control-family study design and population-based Swedish<GPE> registers.We identified 23 880 individuals with visits for sarcoidosis in the National Patient<ORGANIZATION> Register using ICD<ORGANIZATION> codes ( 1964‒2013 ). Information Löfgren<PERSON> 's syndrome was available for a subset diagnosed at Karolinska University Hospital<ORGANIZATION>. General population controls were matched to cases ( 10:1 ). Relatives of cases and controls were identified from the Multi-Generation Register and ascertained for sarcoidosis in the Patient Register<ORGANIZATION>. We estimated familial relative risks ( RR ) for sarcoidosis using conditional logistic regression and the heritability using biometric models.Having ≥1 first degree relative with sarcoidosis was associated with a 3.7-fold increase in the risk for sarcoidosis ( 95 % CI 3.4-4.1 ). The RR<ORGANIZATION> increased in those with ≥2 relatives ( RR 4.7 ) and in Löfgren<GPE> 's syndrome ( RR 4.1 ). The heritability was 39 % ( 95 % CI 12-65 ) .This large investigation showed that having a relative with sarcoidosis is a very strong risk factor for the disease. Genetic variation is an important, albeit partial, contributing factor to the risk for sarcoidosis.
