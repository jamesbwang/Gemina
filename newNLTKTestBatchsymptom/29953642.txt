 Myelin<GPE> sheath is critical for the proper functioning of the peripheral nervous system ( PNS<ORGANIZATION> ), which allows the effective conduction of nerve impulses. Fibroblast growth factor 9 ( FGF9<ORGANIZATION> ) is an autocrine and paracrine protein in the fibroblast growth factor family that regulates cell differentiation and proliferation. Fgf9 Schwann<PERSON> cell ( SC ) conditional knockout mice were developed to detect the role of FGF9<ORGANIZATION> in the PNS<ORGANIZATION>. In our study, the absence of Fgf9<PERSON> led to delayed myelination in early development. The expression of mature SC-related genes decreased, and the expression of genes associated with immature SCs<ORGANIZATION> increased in the Fgf9<ORGANIZATION> knockout mice. These data were consistent with the morphology and praxeology we observed during the development of the peripheral nerves. Extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) are key signals for myelination, and our results showed that Fgf9<PERSON> ablation led to the inactivation of ERK1/2. Further<PERSON> research was performed to detect the role of FGF9<ORGANIZATION> in peripheral nerve injury. In superoxide dismutase 1-G93A mice with Fgf9 SC<PERSON> knockout, we found that Fgf9<PERSON> ablation inhibited the expressions of Cd68<GPE>, Il-1Î², and Cd86<PERSON>, which contributed to the degeneration of the axon and myelin sheath.
