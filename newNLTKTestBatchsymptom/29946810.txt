 This study examines the long-term outcomes of paediatric Morquio ( MPS<ORGANIZATION> IVA ) patients undergoing cervical spine surgery and evaluates the factors that impacting this. A retrospective review was performed on all MPS<ORGANIZATION> IVA patients undergoing cervical spine surgery, since the introduction of standardised neuroradiological screening. The impact of preoperative neurological status, growth, genotype and radiological status on outcome is assessed, whilst long-term surgical, radiological and neurological outcomes are documented. Twenty-six of the eighty-two MPS<ORGANIZATION> IVA patients ( 31 % ) reviewed underwent cervical spine surgery at a median age of 6.1 years ( range, 1.45 to 15.24 ). Preoperatively, cord signal change was seen in 11 patients with 5 being myelopathic ; however, 6 clinically manifesting patients had no overt cord signal change. Postoperatively, none of the 14 preoperatively clinically asymptomatic patients followed long term progressed neurologically during a median follow-up of 77.5 months ( range = 18-161 ). Of the ten preoperatively clinically symptomatic patients who were followed up for the same duration, seven continued to deteriorate, two initially improved and one remained stable. Radiological follow-up performed for a median duration of 7 years ( range = 0.5-16 ) has shown a degree of stenosis at the level immediately caudal to the termination of the graft in 76 % of patients, though only one has become clinically symptomatic and required revision. Once clinically elicitable neurological signs become evident in patients with MPS<ORGANIZATION> IVA, they tend to progress despite surgical intervention. Referring clinicians should also not be falsely reassured by the lack of T2<GPE> spinal cord signal change but should consider surgical intervention in the face of new clinical symptomology or radiological signs of progressive canal stenosis or instability.
