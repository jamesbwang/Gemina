 There is no accepted protocol for inpatient versus ambulatory cleft lip surgery. The aim of this study was to review the safety of outpatient repair and develop guidelines. A retrospective review of patients younger than 2 years undergoing primary cleft lip repair from 2008 to 2015 at six centers was performed. Patients were divided into two groups: predominantly ambulatory ( discharged or admitted for specific concerns ) and inpatient ( admitted due to surgeon 's preference ). The impact of independent variables on admission, emergency department visits, and readmission within 1 month of discharge was analyzed. Of 546 patients, 68.1 percent were boys, 4.4 percent had syndromes, and 23.6 percent had comorbidities. One hundred forty-two patients were admitted postoperatively. Forty-nine admissions were attributable to the surgeon 's preference. After excluding this subset, our ambulatory surgery rate was 81 percent. There was no difference in emergency department visits ( 3 percent versus 2.2 percent ; p = 0.6 ) or readmissions ( 0 percent versus 1.45 percent ; p = 0.5 ) between groups. None of the ambulatory surgery patients were readmitted within 36 hours, for a successful ambulatory surgery rate of 100 percent. Female<PERSON> sex ; surgical time ; prematurity and/or postconceptional age younger than 52 weeks ; and cardiac, respiratory, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and other congenital comorbidities had significant impact on admission rates in the predominantly ambulatory group ( p < 0.05 ). Respiratory comorbidities and syndromes were risk factors for readmission if patients presented to the emergency department ( p < 0.05 ). Ambulatory<PERSON> cleft lip repair can be performed safely in most patients with no difference in emergency department visits or readmission. Patients with comorbidities should be admitted for observation. Therapeutic, IV<ORGANIZATION>.
