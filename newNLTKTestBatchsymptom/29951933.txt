 The study aimed to explore some novel diagnostic biomarkers for papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC<ORGANIZATION> ) by identifying the different expression of TROP-2, SLP-2 and CD56<ORGANIZATION> in benign and malignant thyroid lesions. We evaluated the mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expressions of TROP-2 and SLP-2 in fine needle aspirates ( FNAs<ORGANIZATION> ) which contained 10 PTCs<ORGANIZATION> and 10 benign follicular adenomas ( FAs<ORGANIZATION> ) using quantitative real-time PCR<ORGANIZATION> ( qRT-PCR ). Immunohistochemical ( IHC<ORGANIZATION> ) staining of TROP-2, SLP-2 and CD56<ORGANIZATION> was also performed on postoperative samples of 30 PTCs<ORGANIZATION> and 29 FAs. Membranous or cytoplasmic staining in > 10 % of cells was considered as positive. Diagnostic<PERSON> sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value ( NPV<ORGANIZATION> ) and diagnostic accuracy of these three biomarkers were carried out. We further analyzed the associations between the clinical features and the expressions of markers in PTCs<GPE>. The mRNA<ORGANIZATION> expressions of both TROP-2 and SLP-2 were increased substantially in PTCs<ORGANIZATION> in comparison with those in FAs<GPE> ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Similarly, IHC<ORGANIZATION> for these two proteins demonstrated higher positive staining in PTCs<ORGANIZATION> than in FAs<GPE> ( 96.5 % vs. 12.5 % for TROP-2, 83.3 % vs. 20.7 % for SLP-2, P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). Conversely, CD56<ORGANIZATION> expression was lost with 86.7 % of PTCs<ORGANIZATION>. In identifying malignancy, TROP-2 was the most sensitive marker and CD56<ORGANIZATION> was the most specific one. When the markers were combined, the sensitivity and NPV<ORGANIZATION> increased to 100 % and had better diagnostic accuracy. However, no association was found between biomarker expressions and clinicopathological factors in PTCs<GPE>. We found that TROP-2, SLP-2 and CD56<ORGANIZATION> were effective diagnostic markers for PTC<ORGANIZATION>, especially when they were combined to use.
