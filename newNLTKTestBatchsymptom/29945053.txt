 The objective of this study was to evaluate semen quality and fertility in beef bulls grazing the ergot alkaloid ( EA ) producing tall fescue cultivar, Kentucky<PERSON> 31 ( KY31<ORGANIZATION> ), compared to a novel endophyte ( NE ) cultivar lacking EA. Two studies were conducted over a 3-year period. In studies 1 ( n = 10 ; ages ≥ 24 mo ) and 2 ( n = 53 over two years ; ages 12-16 mo ), Angus<GPE> ( AN ) bulls were stratified by body weight ( BW ), body condition score ( BCS<ORGANIZATION> ), and scrotal circumference ( SC ), and then allotted to graze either KY31 or NE for 56 days. Semen samples were collected, and BW<ORGANIZATION>, BCS<ORGANIZATION>, and SC were evaluated at the start of treatment ( TRT<ORGANIZATION> ) on day ( d ) 0 and every 28 days to the end of each study. In addition, blood samples were collected on d 0 and every 28 days for assessment of circulating prolactin ( PRL<ORGANIZATION> ) levels in study 2. On d 56, for both studies, semen from bulls ( n = 2 per treatment in study 1 and n = 4 per treatment in study 2 ) with similar and acceptable quality were extended, kept at 19° C, and used for timed artificial insemination ( TAI<ORGANIZATION> ) of primi- and multiparous AN and AN- crossbred females. Pregnancy was evaluated at 35 and 90 days post-TAI via transrectal ultrasonography to determine pregnancy rates. Serum PRL<PERSON> concentrations showed a TRT by d effect ( P<PERSON> ≤ 0.05 ), with values for bulls grazing KY31<ORGANIZATION> decreased on d 28 and d 56 of grazing compared to NE. In studies 1 and 2, bull BW and BCS<ORGANIZATION> were affected by d ( P<PERSON> ≤ 0.05 ), but not by TRT<ORGANIZATION>. No TRT<PERSON> or TRT<ORGANIZATION> by d effect on semen quality was observed in either study ; however, d impacted both velocity and concentration in study 2 ( P<PERSON> ≤ 0.05 ). In study 1, TAI<ORGANIZATION> pregnancy rates at 35 days post-TAI were lower ( P<PERSON> ≤ 0.05 ) in the group inseminated with semen from bulls grazing KY31<ORGANIZATION> ; however, in study 2, pregnancy rates did not differ due to treatment 35 post-TAI ( P<PERSON> > 0.05 ). Grazing KY31<ORGANIZATION> negatively impacted serum PRL<ORGANIZATION> concentrations, supporting previous observations ; however, consumption of KY31<ORGANIZATION> had no effect on growth or semen quality of AN<ORGANIZATION> bulls ranging from 12 to ≥24 mo of age. Furthermore, fertility data is inconsistent between studies and requires further investigation.
