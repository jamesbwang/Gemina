 Understanding the differential diagnosis between moisture-associated skin damage ( MASD<ORGANIZATION> ) and pressure ulcers ( PU ) ensures appropriate management and interventions are instigated at the earliest opportunity. Most damage occurring to the buttocks or sacrum is attributed to pressure, shear, excessive moisture or a combination of these factors. MASD<ORGANIZATION> caused by excessive moisture to the sacrum/buttock area is recognised as incontinence-associated dermatitis ( IAD<ORGANIZATION> ) ; its occurrence is an identified risk factor in the development of PUs<ORGANIZATION>. Treatment for IAD<ORGANIZATION> should therefore focus on both IAD<ORGANIZATION> management and pressure ulcer prevention.
