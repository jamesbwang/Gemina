 This study aimed to investigate the possible effects and underlying mechanisms of Kangzhi<GPE> syrup on ovalbumin- ( OVA- ) induced cough variant asthma ( CVA<ORGANIZATION> ) in guinea pigs. All 48 guinea pigs were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: normal, OVA<ORGANIZATION> model with or without Kangzhi<GPE> syrup ( OVA<ORGANIZATION> and OVA<ORGANIZATION> + KZ ), and OVA<ORGANIZATION> with Dexamethasone<GPE> ( OVA<ORGANIZATION> + DM ). After sensitizing the guinea pigs, a cough challenge was performed by the inhalation of capsaicin. The antitussive effect, inflammatory cells, cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF<ORGANIZATION> ) and lung tissue, and morphological changes were examined. Compared with model group, Kangzhi<PERSON> syrup effectively exerted an antitussive effect ( The results demonstrated that Kangzhi<PERSON> syrup exerted a considerable antitussive effect in CVA<ORGANIZATION> animal model, which depended on its marked impact on the anti-anaphylactic inflammation. Additionally, it could ameliorate the airway remodeling by inhibiting NF-
