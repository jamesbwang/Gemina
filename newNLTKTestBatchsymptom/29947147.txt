 Antibody-mediated rejection is responsible for 30-50 % of renal graft failures. Differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing plasmablasts depends on the collaboration of follicular helper T cells ( Tfh ). We analysed circulating Tfh<GPE> ( cTfh<ORGANIZATION> ) in kidney recipients and studied cTfh<ORGANIZATION> relationship with anti-HLA antibody production and graft outcome. cTfh were longitudinally analysed in a prospective cohort of patients ( n=206 ), pre- and post-transplantation. Clinical<PERSON> data, HLA<ORGANIZATION> sensitization and cTfh<ORGANIZATION> function were recorded. Both pre-transplant and 6-month post-transplant cTfh were able to derive IgG-producing plasmablasts. Pre-transplant cTfh were decreased in patients, especially in those who received dialysis. However, these cells were increased in patients with previous allograft or transfusions, and in HLA-sensitized recipients. After transplantation cTfh<ORGANIZATION> expanded, significantly more in patients who developed de novo anti-HLA antibodies than in patients who remained unsensitized. Augmented pre-transplant cTfh<ORGANIZATION> positively correlated with higher intensity of pre-transplant anti-HLA class I, and de novo anti-HLA class I and anti-HLA class II antibodies. Consistently, pre-transplantation cTfh were higher in patients who experienced acute rejection ( HR=1.14 ( 1.04-1.25 ) ). Thus, we show a role for Tfh in anti-HLA sensitization and rejection. Multicentre studies with additional patient cohorts are needed to validate these results. Immunosuppressive drugs targeting Tfh<PERSON> could be useful to improve outcome.
