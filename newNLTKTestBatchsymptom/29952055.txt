 In order to investigate the effects of dietary betaine on meat quality and oxidative status of broilers under heat stress ( HS ), a total of 144 Arbor Acres<PERSON> male broilers were randomly allocated to 3 groups with 6 replicates of 8 broilers per replicate from 21 to 42 days of age. The broilers in the control group were raised at 22°C and received a basal diet, and the broilers in the other two groups were raised at 34°C from 9:00 to 17:00 and at 22°C for the rest of time and fed a basal diet with or without 1000 mg kg Dietary betaine supplementation tended ( P<PERSON> < 0.1 ) to reverse the decreased body weight gain and feed intake of broilers induced by HS<ORGANIZATION>. The decreased redness ( a* value ) of breast muscle in broilers under HS<ORGANIZATION> was restored ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) by betaine, which tended ( P<PERSON> < 0.1 ) to decrease drip loss of breast muscle. The broilers fed betaine-supplemented diets had a tendency ( P<PERSON> < 0.1 ) to increase moisture content but decrease crude protein content of breast muscle in broilers under HS. Moreover, betaine resulted in higher ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) glutathione content and activities of superoxidae dismutase and glutathione peroxidase but lower ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ) malondialdehyde content in breast muscle of broilers exposed to HS. Dietary betaine supplementation alleviated the negative effects of HS<ORGANIZATION> on some traits of meat quality and oxidative status of broilers. This article is protected by copyright.
