 There seems to be a clear correlation between antibodies against domain I ( anti-DI ) of β2Glycoprotein<ORGANIZATION> I and severe clinical profiles in antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS<ORGANIZATION> ) patients. We investigated the clinical significance of anti-DI antibodies in a cohort of aPL<ORGANIZATION> carriers. One hundred and five carriers persistently positive for IgG<ORGANIZATION> anti-β2Glycoprotein 1 antibodies ( a-β2GPI ) and/or IgG<ORGANIZATION> anticardiolipin ( aCL<ORGANIZATION> ) and/or lupus anticoagulants ( LAC<ORGANIZATION> ) were tested for the presence of anti-DI antibodies using the QUANTA<ORGANIZATION> Flash® Beta2GPI-Domain I chemiluminescence immunoassay. Anti-DI antibodies were detected in 44 aPL carriers ( 41.9 % ) and they were significantly associated to triple aPL<ORGANIZATION> positivity ( LAC<ORGANIZATION> plus IgG<ORGANIZATION> a-β2GPI plus IgG<ORGANIZATION> aCL antibodies ). Isolated LAC<ORGANIZATION> and a-β2GPI antibodies were significantly associated to anti-DI negative aPL<ORGANIZATION> carriers. During a 82.2 month mean follow-up, ten aPL<ORGANIZATION> carriers ( 9.5 % ) developed a first thrombotic event so becoming APS<ORGANIZATION> patients. Anti-DI antibodies, triple aPL<ORGANIZATION> positivity, thromboembolic risk factors and autoimmune disorders significantly prevailed in carriers becoming APS<ORGANIZATION>. Logistic regression analysis showed that anti-DI positivity was an independent risk factor for thrombosis. Anti-DI antibody positivity can be considered a new risk factor predictive of the first thrombotic event in aPL<ORGANIZATION> carriers, instead, negative anti-DI may be useful to identify low-risk aPL<ORGANIZATION> carriers.
