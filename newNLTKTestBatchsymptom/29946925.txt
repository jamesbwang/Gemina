 To investigate whether multiphasic MDCT<ORGANIZATION> enhancement profiles can help to identify PTEN<ORGANIZATION> expression in clear cell renal cell carcinomas ( ccRCCs<ORGANIZATION> ). Lack of PTEN<ORGANIZATION> expression is associated with worsened overall survival, a more advanced Fuhrman grade, and a greater likelihood of lymph mode metastasis. With IRB<ORGANIZATION> approval for this retrospective study, we derived a cohort of 103 histologically proven ccRCCs<ORGANIZATION> with preoperative 4-phase renal mass MDCT from 2001-2013. Following manual segmentation, a computer-assisted detection algorithm selected a 0.5-cm-diameter region of maximal attenuation within each lesion in each phase ; a 0.5-cm-diameter region of interest was manually placed on uninvolved renal cortex in each phase. The relative attenuation of each lesion was calculated as [ ( Maximal<ORGANIZATION> lesion attenuation - cortex attenuation ) /cortex attenuation ] Ã— 100. Absolute<PERSON> and relative attenuation in each phase were compared using t tests. The performance of multiphasic enhancement in identifying PTEN<ORGANIZATION> expression was assessed with logistic regression analysis. PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative ccRCCs both exhibited peak enhancement in the corticomedullary phase. Relative corticomedullary phase attenuation was significantly greater for PTEN-negative ccRCCs<ORGANIZATION> in comparison to PTEN-positive ccRCCs<ORGANIZATION> ( 33.7 vs. 9.5, p = 0.03 ). After controlling for lesion stage and size, relative corticomedullary phase attenuation had an accuracy of 84 % ( 86/103 ), specificity of 100 % ( 84/84 ), sensitivity of 11 % ( 2/19 ), positive predictive value of 100 % ( 2/2 ), and negative predictive value of 83 % ( 84/101 ) in identifying PTEN<ORGANIZATION> expression. Relative corticomedullary phase attenuation may help to identify PTEN<ORGANIZATION> expression in ccRCCs<GPE>, if validated prospectively.
