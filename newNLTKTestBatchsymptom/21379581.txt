 Little<GPE> is known about associations between dietary inflammation, age and anthropometric measurements. In this regard, we examine how DII<ORGANIZATION> is related to age, anthropometrics [ weight, Body<PERSON> mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ), waist to hip ratio ( WHR<ORGANIZATION> ) ] and other parameters of nutrition ( energy, protein, fats and cholesterol intake, Net Endogenous Acid<PERSON> Production ( NEAP<ORGANIZATION> ) and Phytochemical Index<ORGANIZATION> ( PI ) ) in a cross-sectional study in Pakistan<GPE>. Only men ( The results show that with increasing age, there was a significant increase in the DII<ORGANIZATION> score ( In conclusion, the present study shows direct positive correlations between the DII<ORGANIZATION>, age and indices of obesity, and thus supports the hypothesis that diet may have a role in the development of obesity through inflammatory modulation mechanisms in elderly.
