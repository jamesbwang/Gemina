 Nineteen percent of 9 years old Irish<GPE> children are overweight ; seven percent are obese. Our aims were: to examine whether differences exist between paternal self-reported and measured height, weight and BMI<ORGANIZATION> in a population representative sample ; and to explore paternal perceptions of their own weight status. Measures of height and weight for fathers and for their children from the National Longitudinal Study<ORGANIZATION> of Children<GPE> Growing Up in Ireland<GPE> were obtained using validated methods. Three quarters of fathers ( 6,263 of 8,568 study children ) with a mean age of 42 years ( SD 5.04 ) responded. The mean difference between self-reported and measured weight was -1.03kg ( SD=4.52 ), indicating that weight was underestimated. Obese fathers were more likely to have an obese son ( 9.4 % compared to 5.3 % for the full cohort ) and an obese daughter ( 12.4 % compared to 7.7 % ). These data suggest that there is a strong relationship between fathers ' weights and his childrens ' weights. A leading factor in the development of childhood obesity is parental obesity. Targeting overweight and obesity in the child should occur simultaneously with tackling overweight and obesity in the parents ; in this study, the fathers.
