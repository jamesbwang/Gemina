 This retrospective study examined the effect of voice rehabilitation training ( VRT<ORGANIZATION> ) for patients with laryngeal cancer ( LC ) after radiotherapy.Eighty-three eligible patients with LC<ORGANIZATION> were included. Forty-three patients were assigned to a treatment group, and underwent VRT<ORGANIZATION>, while the other 40 subjects were assigned to a control group, and were at waiting list. Primary outcome was measured by the Grade<GPE>, Roughness<ORGANIZATION>, Breathiness<GPE>, Asthenia<GPE>, and Strain<GPE> ( GRBAS<ORGANIZATION> ) scale. Secondary outcome was measured by Patient Perception Measures<PERSON>. All outcomes were measured before and 3 months after VRT<ORGANIZATION> intervention.Patients in the treatment group did not show better outcomes, measured by GRBAS<ORGANIZATION> scale ( Grade<PERSON>, P<PERSON> = .78 ; Roughness<ORGANIZATION>, P<PERSON> = .61 ; Breathiness<GPE>, P<PERSON> = .83 ; Ashenia<GPE>, P<PERSON> = .89 ; and Strain<GPE>, P<PERSON> = .41 ), and Patient Perception Measures<PERSON> ( Vocal<ORGANIZATION> quality, P<PERSON> = .17 ; Acceptability<GPE>, P<PERSON> = .35 ; Hoarseness<ORGANIZATION>, P<PERSON> = .23 ; Vocal<GPE> fatigue, P<PERSON> = .39 ; and Ashamed<PERSON>, P<PERSON> = .51 ), compared with patients in the control group.The results of this study did not exert better outcomes in patients received VRT<ORGANIZATION> than those at waiting list.
