 Obesity<GPE> among human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV<ORGANIZATION> ) -infected individuals is on the rise. Bariatric<PERSON> procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB<ORGANIZATION> ) and sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) alter the GI<ORGANIZATION> tract. Whether this alteration has any impact on the absorption of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART<ORGANIZATION> ), thus affecting HIV<ORGANIZATION> disease markers such as CD4<ORGANIZATION> cell count or viral load ( VL ), is not yet known. We conducted this review to look into the outcomes of bariatric surgery procedures, RYGB<ORGANIZATION>, SG<ORGANIZATION> and adjustable gastric band ( AGB<ORGANIZATION> ) and its effects on the CD4<ORGANIZATION> cell counts and VL<ORGANIZATION> and HAART<ORGANIZATION> therapy. A literature search was conducted between January and April 2017, by two independent reviewers, using Pubmed<PERSON> and Google Scholar<PERSON>. The terms 'bariatric surgery and HIV<ORGANIZATION> ', 'obesity surgery and HIV<ORGANIZATION> ', 'gastric bypass surgery and HIV<ORGANIZATION> ', 'sleeve gastrectomy and HIV<ORGANIZATION> ' and 'gastric band and HIV<ORGANIZATION> ' were used to retrieve available research. Of the 49 papers reviewed, only 12 reported the outcomes of patients with HIV<ORGANIZATION> undergoing bariatric surgery and were therefore included in this review. Six papers assessed patients undergoing RYGB<ORGANIZATION> only ( N = 18 ), 3 papers reported on SG only ( N = 18 ) and 3 papers reported on case mix, including 7 cases of RYGB<ORGANIZATION>, 4 cases of SG<ORGANIZATION> and 11 cases of AGB<ORGANIZATION>. Data<PERSON> is limited ; however, based on the available data, bariatric surgery is safe in HIV-infected individuals and does not have any adverse impact on HIV<ORGANIZATION> disease progress. Additionally, there was no difference in HIV-related outcomes between SG<ORGANIZATION> and RYGB<ORGANIZATION>.
