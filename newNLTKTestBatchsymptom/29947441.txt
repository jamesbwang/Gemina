 What is the central question of this study ? Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) is an important obesity/diabetes target, with effects dependent on circulating GLP-1 concentrations. Peripheral tissues extract GLP-1, therefore sampling venous versus arterialised blood may provide different GLP-1 concentrations. This study examined whether arterialisation alters GLP-1 concentrations during fasting and feeding. What is the main finding and its importance ? This study demonstrates that venous blood provides lower postprandial, but not fasting, GLP-1 concentrations versus arterialised blood. Therefore, when accurate assessment of postprandial peripheral availability of GLP-1 is required, blood sampling methods should be carefully considered, clearly reported, and arterialisation is recommended. Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) displays concentration-dependent effects on metabolism, appetite and angiogenesis, so accurate determination of circulating GLP-1 concentrations is important. This study compared GLP-1 concentrations in venous versus arterialised blood under both fasted and fed conditions. Venous<PERSON> and arterialised blood samples were simultaneously drawn from ten, young, healthy men before, and 30, 60 and 120 min after, ingestion of 75 g glucose. Plasma<PERSON> GLP-1 concentrations increased in response to glucose ingestion ( time effect: p < 0.01 ) and to a lesser extend in venous versus arterialised plasma ( time x arterialisation interaction: p < 0.01 ). Accordingly, the plasma incremental area under the curve was lower in venous versus arterialised plasma ( 974 ± 88 versus 1214 ± 115 pmol·L x 120 min
