 The CO2<ORGANIZATION> electroreduction reaction has been investigated on Cu<GPE> ( 100 ) and Cu<GPE> ( 111 ) surfaces in 0.1 M KClO4, KCl<ORGANIZATION>, KBr<ORGANIZATION> and KI<ORGANIZATION> electrolytes. The formation of ethylene ( C2H4<ORGANIZATION> ) and ethanol ( EtOH<ORGANIZATION> ) products on these surfaces generally increased as the electrolyte anion was changed from ClO4- → Cl- → Br- → I-. For example, on Cu<GPE> ( 100 ) at -1.23<ORGANIZATION> V vs. RHE<ORGANIZATION>, as the electrolyte anion changed from ClO4- to I-, the Faradaic<ORGANIZATION> efficiencies of ethylene ( FEethylene<ORGANIZATION> ) improved from 31 to 50 %, FEethanol<ORGANIZATION> increased from 7 to 16 %, and the current densities of ethylene and ethanol showed respectively 5 and 7 folds enhancement. A remarkable total FE up to 74 % for C2 and C3 products were also obtained in the KI<ORGANIZATION> electrolyte. Despite their roughening in the presence of the electrolytes, the Cu ( 100 ) electrode still showed a greater propensity than Cu<GPE> ( 111 ) for enhancing the formation of C2<GPE> compounds. The favorable reduction of CO2<ORGANIZATION> to C2<GPE> products in KI<GPE> electrolyte was correlated with a higher *CO population on the surface, as shown using linear sweep voltammetry. In situ Raman spectroscopy indicates that the coordination environment of *CO was altered by the electrolyte anion used. Thus, apart from affecting the morphology of the electrode and local pH, we propose that the anion plays a critical role in enhancing the formation of C2<GPE> products, by tuning the coordination environment of adsorbed *CO for more efficient C-C coupling.
