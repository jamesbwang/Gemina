 Heart<GPE> failure readmissions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Adequate<ORGANIZATION> education on adherence and self-care behaviours can affect readmission rates positively and nurses are at the frontline of patient education. Such education is valuable when establishing heart failure programmes in developing countries, in light of the challenging socioeconomic circumstances in these. This study aimed to evaluate nurses ' heart failure knowledge, to assess patients ' baseline knowledge, and to evaluate the effectiveness of structured nurse-driven education. a total of 131 cardiac centre-based nurses and 30 chronic heart failure patients participated in the study in Kuwait<GPE>. Patients were surveyed a second time 3 to 6 months later, while being followed at an advanced heart failure clinic by dedicated heart failure nurses. the majority of the nurses ( 80 % ) had not received heart failure education previously, although they were able to recognise most heart failure symptoms. Significant improvement in patients ' knowledge was noted between the initial and follow-up surveys. establishing a dedicated advanced heart failure programme to care for patients in a developing country can result in significant improvement in disease awareness and self-care behaviours when led by well-trained heart failure nurses. More research is needed to determine if these findings are shared by other countries in the Middle-East and other developing countries.
