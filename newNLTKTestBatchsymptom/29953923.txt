 There are global efforts in developing therapeutic strategies for central nervous system ( CNS<ORGANIZATION> ) injuries using multimodal approaches. Nogo<PERSON> receptor type 1 ( NgR1<ORGANIZATION> ) has been known as a primary molecule limiting neuronal regeneration in the adult CNS<ORGANIZATION>. We identified lateral olfactory tract usher substance ( LOTUS<ORGANIZATION> ) as an endogenous NgR1<ORGANIZATION> antagonist. Membrane-bound LOTUS<ORGANIZATION> interacts with NgR1<ORGANIZATION> and inhibits its function by blocking its ligand binding. Five molecules including Nogo<PERSON>, myelin-associated glycoprotein ( MAG<ORGANIZATION> ), oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein ( OMgp<ORGANIZATION> ), B lymphocyte stimulator ( BLyS<ORGANIZATION> ) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans ( CSPGs<ORGANIZATION> ) have been identified as NgR1<ORGANIZATION> ligands. These ligands bind to NgR1<ORGANIZATION> and activate NgR1<ORGANIZATION> signaling, leading to axon growth inhibition such as growth cone collapse and neurite outgrowth inhibition. We have recently reported that the soluble form of LOTUS<GPE> ( s-LOTUS ) also suppressed NgR1-mediated signaling induced by myelin axonal inhibitors ( MAIs<ORGANIZATION> ) including Nogo<PERSON>, MAG<ORGANIZATION> and OMgp<ORGANIZATION> by binding with both NgR1<ORGANIZATION> and its co-receptor p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75
