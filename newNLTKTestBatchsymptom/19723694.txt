 The aim of the study was to compare the two approaches to chronic right ventricular pacing currently adopted in clinical practice: right ventricular apical ( RVA<ORGANIZATION> ) and non-RVA pacing. Chronic RVA<PERSON> pacing is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, morbidity, and even mortality. Non-RVA pacing may yield more physiologic ventricular activation and provide potential long-term benefits and has recently been adopted as standard procedure at many implanting centers. The Right Pace<ORGANIZATION> study was a multicenter, prospective, single-blind, nonrandomized trial involving 437 patients indicated for dual-chamber pacemaker implantation with a high percentage of RV pacing. RV lead-tip target location was the apex or the interventricular septum. RVA ( 274 ) and non-RVA patients ( 163 ) did not differ in baseline characteristics. During a median follow-up of 19 months ( 25th-75th percentiles, 13-25 ), 17 patients died. The rates of the primary outcome of death due to any cause or hospitalization for heart failure were comparable between the groups ( log-rank test, In patients with indications for dual-chamber pacemaker who require a high percentage of ventricular stimulation, RVA<ORGANIZATION> or non-RVA pacing resulted in comparable outcomes.
