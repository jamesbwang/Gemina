 Low<PERSON> back pain ( LBP<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most commonly reported cause of disability in people under the age of 45 and is estimated to occur in 60-70 % of the adult population in the industrialized world. This case report describes the use of Pilates-based exercise ( PBE<ORGANIZATION> ) in the physical therapy management of a patient with persistent chronic low back pain ( CLBP<ORGANIZATION> ) following transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. The patient was a 24-year-old female with a 7-year history of LBP<ORGANIZATION> presenting 17 months following surgery. The patient remained with constant LBP<ORGANIZATION> and right hip pain at 8/10 on the Numeric Pain<ORGANIZATION> Rating Scale ( NPRS<ORGANIZATION> ) after completing a course of physical therapy following the lumbar fusion. The PBE<ORGANIZATION> intervention lasted for 22 sessions during which the patient demonstrated complete resolution of right hip pain and remained with intermittent LBP<ORGANIZATION> ( 2/10 NPRS ) at discharge. Minimally Clinically Important Difference<PERSON> levels for all self-reported outcome measure instruments were exceeded at discharge. The patient returned to work with lifting restrictions. Patients following spine surgery are often excluded in studies of spine stabilization and PBE<ORGANIZATION> interventions. This case report describes the use of PBE<ORGANIZATION> in the treatment of a patient following spine fusion. Research to elucidate the impact of PBE<ORGANIZATION> on patients with CLBP<ORGANIZATION> is needed.
