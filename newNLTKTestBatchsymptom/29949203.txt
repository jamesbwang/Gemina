 Mid-face Toddler Excoriation Syndrome<PERSON> ( MiTES<ORGANIZATION> ) is a condition recently reported in 3 unrelated children. We describe 5 further children, from 4 families, with facial lesions typical of MiTES<ORGANIZATION>, in whom mutation analysis of PRDM12<ORGANIZATION> was carried out. Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic expansions of the PRDM12<ORGANIZATION> poly-alanine tract were found in 4 of 5 affected individuals, in 3 families. Our finding of autosomal recessive mutations in PRDM12<GPE> in 4 out of 5 patients with MiTES<ORGANIZATION> extends the phenotypic spectrum of PRDM12<ORGANIZATION> mutations, which usually cause HSAN8<ORGANIZATION>, characterised by mutilating self-inflicted wounds of extremities, lips and tongue. By contrast, MiTES<ORGANIZATION> shows severe mid-facial lesions with little if any evidence of generalised pain insensitivity. The condition is probably genetically heterogeneous and other congenital insensitivity to pain ( CIP<ORGANIZATION> ) and HSAN<ORGANIZATION> genes such as SCN11A<ORGANIZATION> may be implicated. This new understanding of the nature of MiTES<ORGANIZATION>, which can masquerade as factitious disease, will facilitate appropriate management. This article is protected by copyright.
