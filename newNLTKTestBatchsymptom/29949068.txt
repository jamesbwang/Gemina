 In this report, we describe the knowledge and beliefs on causes and management of otitis media of an indigenous Filipino community with a high prevalence of otitis media that is associated with an A2ML1<ORGANIZATION> variant. Community<ORGANIZATION> lectures and individual genetic counseling were provided as intervention. Knowledge, beliefs, and health care-seeking behavior pertaining to otitis media were assessed pre- and post-genetic counseling. Twenty-five heads of households were interviewed. Beliefs regarding etiology of ear discharge varied widely, with swimming in the sea as the most commonly cited cause of ear discharge. During the post-counseling session, poor personal hygiene, dirty environment, and familial inheritance were mentioned as risk factors for otitis media or ear discharge. Knowledge about the genotypes for the A2ML1<ORGANIZATION> variant and otitis media diagnoses within the household influenced beliefs on the role of hygiene and genetic susceptibility to otitis media and attitudes towards health care-seeking behavior. Genetic counseling was associated with variable improvement in knowledge on otitis media and in their understanding of genetic susceptibility to otitis media due to the A2ML1<ORGANIZATION> variant. Language barriers, literacy level, cultural factors, and the complex nature of genetic information made genetic counseling in the particular population a challenge. Insights drawn from this experience recommend follow-up visits in the community.
