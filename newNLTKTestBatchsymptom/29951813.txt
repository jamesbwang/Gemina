 Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease ( AD ) is the most epidemic neuronal dysfunctions among elderly people. It is accompanied by neuronal disorders along with learning and memory defects, as well as massive neurodegeneration phenotype. The presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles ( NFTs<ORGANIZATION> ) and extracellular amyloid plaques, called senile plaques ( SPs<ORGANIZATION> ), and brain atrophy are typically observed in the brains of AD<ORGANIZATION> patients. It has been over 20 years since the discovery that small peptide, called beta-amyloid ( Aβ ), has pivotal role for the disease formation. Since then, a variety of drugs have been developed to cure AD<ORGANIZATION> ; however, there is currently no effective drug for the disorder. This therapeutic void reflects lacks of ideal model system, which can evaluate the progression of AD in a short period. Recently, large numbers of AD<ORGANIZATION> model system have been established using Drosophila<PERSON> melanogaster by overproducing Aβ molecules in the brain. These systems successfully reflect some of the symptoms along with AD<ORGANIZATION>. In this review, we would like to point out `` pros and cons '' of Drosophila<ORGANIZATION> AD models.
