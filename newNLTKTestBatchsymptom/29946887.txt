 Anxious<GPE> youth often have trouble regulating negative affect ( NA<ORGANIZATION> ) and tend to over-rely on parents when faced with challenges. It is unclear how social interactions with parents or peers actually helps or hinders anxious youths ' success in regulating NA<ORGANIZATION>. The aim of this study was to examine whether the success of anxious youths ' emotion regulation strategies differed according to social context. We compared the effectiveness of co-ruminating, co-problem solving and co-distracting with parents/peers for regulating anxious youth 's NA in response to stress in their daily lives. We also examined the benefit of attempting each strategy socially vs. non-socially ( e.g., co-ruminating vs. ruminating ). One-hundred-seventeen youth ( 9-14 ) with a current diagnosis of Separation Anxiety Disorder<ORGANIZATION>, Generalized Anxiety Disorder<ORGANIZATION>, and/or Social Phobia<PERSON> completed an ecological momentary assessment ( 14 calls over 5 days ), reporting on recent stressors, their affective state, presence of others, and emotion regulation strategies within the prior hour. Mixed linear models revealed that co-distracting was the most effective social strategy for reducing NA<ORGANIZATION>, but only for boys. Co-rumination was the least effective social strategy for regulating NA<ORGANIZATION>. Regarding social context, only co-distracting was more effective for regulating NA<ORGANIZATION> over distracting alone, but only among anxious boys. Results suggest that co-rumination is an ineffective use of social support for regulating NA<ORGANIZATION>. Anxious boys may benefit from social support by co-distracting with parents/peers, but improper use may reflect avoidance and contribute to long-term anxiety maintenance. Results extend research on gender differences in interpersonal relationships and emotion regulation.
