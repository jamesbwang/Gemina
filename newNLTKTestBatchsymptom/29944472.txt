 Dolutegravir<GPE> ( DTG<ORGANIZATION> ), a second-generation integrase inhibitor, is an effective treatment for HIV but its safety and efficacy are not well-established in pregnancy. Here, we assess maternal and infant outcomes of mother-infant pairs using DTG<ORGANIZATION> containing regimens during pregnancy. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of pregnant women with HIV<ORGANIZATION> on DTG from two urban clinics in the United States<GPE>, 2015-2018. Maternal outcomes included viral suppression ( viral load of < 20 copies/ml prior to delivery ), development of resistance, and tolerability to DTG<ORGANIZATION>. Infant<PERSON> outcomes included preterm delivery ( birth at < 37 weeks ), small for gestational age ( SGA<ORGANIZATION>, weight < 10th percentile ), infant HIV status at birth, birth defect ( s ), and Apgar<GPE> scores. We performed a trend analysis to assess DTG<ORGANIZATION> use over time. A total of 66 women used DTG<ORGANIZATION> during pregnancy and the proportion on DTG<ORGANIZATION> increased each year: in 2015, 8 % ( 5/60 ) of women were on DTG<ORGANIZATION>, versus 22 % ( 15/67 ) in 2016, 42 % ( 30/71 ) in 2017, and 59 % ( 16/27 ) in 2018 ( p < 0.05 ). Among women who delivered ( n = 57 ), 77.2 % were undetectable at delivery. There were no drug resistance and no reported side effects during pregnancy. Infants<PERSON> had a mean APGAR<ORGANIZATION> score of 8 ( SD 1.5 ) at 1 minute and 9 ( SD 0.8 ) at 5 minutes ; 31.6 % were born prematurely and 15.8 % were SGA<ORGANIZATION>, and 2 infants had a birth defect. No cases of HIV<ORGANIZATION> transmission occurred. Our findings suggest that DTG<ORGANIZATION> can be an effective treatment during pregnancy. Infant<PERSON> outcomes ( preterm deliveries and birth defects ) need to be investigated in larger studies.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons<ORGANIZATION> Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND ), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
