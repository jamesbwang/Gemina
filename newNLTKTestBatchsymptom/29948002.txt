 Retinopathy<GPE> in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE<ORGANIZATION> ) is associated with severe disease and poorer prognosis. We studied retinopathy in our cohort of Indian<GPE> lupus patients. Four hundred and thirty-seven patients fulfilling the Systemic Lupus International<ORGANIZATION> Collaborating Clinics-American College of Rheumatology-2012 criteria, attending the department of Clinical Immunology<PERSON> were enrolled under this cross-sectional study. A comprehensive clinical ( including ophthalmological ) examination and immunological profile were performed. Retinopathy<PERSON> was defined if cotton-wool spots, haemorrhages, vasculitis, retinal detachment or optic disc changes as papilledema, optic atrophy were present. Disease<PERSON> activity was assessed using SLE<ORGANIZATION> disease activity index ( SLEDAI<ORGANIZATION> ). Mean age of participants was 28.06 Â± 9.7 years ( 93.1 % females ) ; median disease duration 12 months ( Interquartile range-IQR 6.36 ). Forty-five ( 10.3 % ) had SLE<ORGANIZATION> associated retinopathy. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia [ 31.1 vs 14.5 %, p value 0.004, odd 's ratio-OR ( 95 % confidence interval-CI ) 2.65 ( 1.33-5.29 ) ], serositis [ 33.3 vs 18.9 %, p value 0.023, OR<GPE> ( CI ) 2.14 ( 1.11-4.10 ) ], lupus nephritis [ 62.2 vs 40.8 %, p value 0.006, OR<GPE> ( CI ) 2.38 ( 1.26-4.50 ) ], seizures [ 28.9 vs 12.8 %, p value 0.004, OR<GPE> ( CI ) 2.77 ( 1.36-5.65 ) ] and median SLEDAI<ORGANIZATION> score ( 24 vs 12, p < 0.01 ) were significantly higher in those with retinopathy. On adjusted binary logistic regression, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, lupus nephritis and presence of antibodies to Smith<GPE> antigen were predictors for retinopathy. Retinopathy<PERSON> is common in SLE<ORGANIZATION>, a marker of active disease with frequent renal involvement and should be screened for in all patients with lupus.
