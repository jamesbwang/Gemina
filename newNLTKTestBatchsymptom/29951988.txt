 FZL<ORGANIZATION> is primarily localized to the chloroplast inner envelope and not to the thylakoids, but nevertheless affects the maintenance of thylakoid membranes and photosynthetic protein complexes. The fuzzy-onion-like protein ( FZL<ORGANIZATION> ) is a membrane-bound dynamin-like GTPase<ORGANIZATION> located in the chloroplast. We have investigated the chloroplast sub-localization of the endogenous FZL<ORGANIZATION> protein and found it to be primarily localized to the inner envelope. Moreover, we observed that mature leaves of fzl mutants start to turn pale, especially in the midvein area of the leaves, 11 days after germination. We therefore assessed their photosynthetic performance as well as the accumulation of thylakoid membrane proteins and complexes after the initial appearance of the phenotype. Interestingly, we could observe a significant decrease in amounts of the cytochrome b
