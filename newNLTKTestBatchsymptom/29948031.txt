 Atrioventricular Septal Defect<ORGANIZATION> ( AVSD<ORGANIZATION> ) is a rare congenital heart defect ( CHD<ORGANIZATION> ) often associated with genetic syndromes, most commonly Down<GPE> syndrome ( DS ). Over the last four decades, surgical repair has increased survival and improved quality of life in these patients. The prevalence of bradyarrhythmias namely, atrioventricular block ( AVB<ORGANIZATION> ) and sinus node dysfunction ( SND<ORGANIZATION> ) in AVSD<ORGANIZATION> is partially known. 522 cases with both partial and complete AVSD<ORGANIZATION> ( 38.7 % with DS<ORGANIZATION> ), undergoing intracardiac repair from 1982 to 2016 at our institution, were reviewed from our system database. 38 ( 7.3 % ) patients received permanent PM implantation for AVB<ORGANIZATION> ( early or late ) or SND<ORGANIZATION>. On one hand, AVB<ORGANIZATION> requiring PM<ORGANIZATION> was found in 26 ( 4.98 % ). This was further subdivided into early-onset 14 ( 2.6 % ) and late-onset AVB 12 ( 2.2 % ) ( median 4 [ IQR<ORGANIZATION> 1-7 ] years ). On the other hand, 12 ( 2.3 % ) experienced late SND requiring PM ( median 11 [ IQR<ORGANIZATION> 3.5-15.2 ] years ). Early and late AVB were independent from the type of AVSD<ORGANIZATION> ( partial or complete ), whereas the late SND<ORGANIZATION> was remarkably observed in complete AVSD<ORGANIZATION> compared to partial AVSD<ORGANIZATION> ( p = 0.017 ). We classified the cohort into two main categories: DS ( 202, 38.7 % ) and non-DS ( 320, 61.3 % ). At Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, DS<ORGANIZATION> was significantly associated with late-onset bradyarrhythmias ( p = 0.024 ). At Cox<ORGANIZATION> regression analysis, we identified DS as an independent predictor of PM<ORGANIZATION> implantation ( HR 2.17 ). In conclusion, about 7 % of repaired AVSD<ORGANIZATION> patients need PM implantation during follow-up. There are no differences in early and late AVB<ORGANIZATION> occurrence according to the type of AVSD<ORGANIZATION>. There is a higher incidence of late SND in repaired complete AVSD<ORGANIZATION>, with a later timing onset in patients with associated DS. Moreover, DS<ORGANIZATION> seems to be an independent predictor of PM<ORGANIZATION> implantation.
