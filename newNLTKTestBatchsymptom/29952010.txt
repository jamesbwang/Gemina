 We evaluated the effect of global warming on Araucaria<GPE> angustifolia ( Bert<PERSON>. ) O. Kuntze, a critically endangered native tree of Southern Brazil<LOCATION>, by studying the effects of short-term high-temperature treatment on cell viability, respiration and DNA<ORGANIZATION> repair of embryogenic cells. Compared with control cells grown at 25°C, cell viability was reduced by 40 % after incubation at 30 and 37°C for 24 and 6h, respectively, while 2h at 40 and 42°C killed 95 % of the cells. Cell<PERSON> respiration was unaffected at 30-37°C, but dramatically reduced after 2h at 42°C. The in vitro activity of enzymes of the base excision repair ( BER ) pathway was determined. AP<ORGANIZATION> endonuclease, measured in extracts from cells incubated for 2h at 42°C, was completely inactivated while lower temperatures had no effect. The activities of three enzymes of the mitochondrial BER pathway were measured after 30 min preincubation of isolated mitochondria at 25-40°C and one of them, uracil glycosylase, was completely inhibited by 40°C. We conclude that cell viability, respiration and DNA<ORGANIZATION> repair have different temperature sensitivities between 25 and 37
