 The morbidity of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is 1 % -2 % in clinic. Radiofrequency<PERSON> catheter ablation ( RFCA<ORGANIZATION> ) is a type of radical interventional therapy for AF<ORGANIZATION>, whereas it may lead to a hypercoagulable state. This study evaluated platelet particle CD62P<ORGANIZATION> and platelet activation biomarker GP IIb/IIIa expressions in AF patients treated by RFCA<ORGANIZATION>, and aimed to analyze their relationships with the hypercoagulable state after RFCA<ORGANIZATION>. A total of 60 AF patients received RFCA<ORGANIZATION> in our hospital were enrolled. The patients were divided into group A as hypercoagulable state group and group B as non-hypercoagulable group. Healthy volunteers were selected as normal control. Serum D-Dimer<PERSON>, parathyroid activity index 1 ( PAI-1 ), and tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) content were tested by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA<ORGANIZATION> ), while peripheral CD62P<ORGANIZATION> and GP<ORGANIZATION> IIb/IIIa expressions were detected by using flow cytometry before, after, and seven days after RFCA<ORGANIZATION>. D-Dimer and PAI-1 levels increased, while t-PA reduced in group A compared with that in group B and control ( p < 0.05 ). D-Dimer and t-PA contents gradually elevated, whereas t-PA level gradually declined in group A before, after, and seven days after RFCA<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.05 ). Serum CD62P<PERSON> and GP<ORGANIZATION> IIb/IIIa expressions in group A were significantly higher compared to that in group B and control ( p < 0.05 ). CD62P<ORGANIZATION> and GP<ORGANIZATION> IIb/IIIa levels were significantly higher seven days after RFCA<ORGANIZATION> compared with immediate after RFCA<ORGANIZATION> in group A ( p < 0.05 ). CD62P<ORGANIZATION> showed a positive correlation with GP<ORGANIZATION> IIb/IIIa in hypercoagulable state patients after RFCA<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.05 ). AF patient may appear in hypercoagulable state after RFCA<ORGANIZATION>. CD62P<ORGANIZATION> and GP<ORGANIZATION> IIb/IIIa significantly increased and exhibited a positive correlation.
