 We evaluated the tolerance and pathogenesis of foodborne pathogens with a simulated gastro-intestinal tract model that simulates the chemical, physical and biological effects of human digestion process under laboratory conditions. This could be used to study the tolerance, pathogenesis, gut microbiota interaction and vaccine development of foodborne pathogens, so as to contribute to control and treatment of foodborne pathogens. This review introduces the applications of simulated gastro-intestinal tract model tp evaluate foodborne pathogens, which includes in-vitro static gastro-intestinal model, in-vitro dynamic gastro-intestinal model, conventional animal model and humanized animal model. And the concepts and characteristics of all models are described in detail. Also, the shortcomings of existing models are analyzed, and improvements of artificial gastro-intestinal tract model are prospected. In conclusion, this review could provide comprehensive data for promoting the progress of studying tolerance and pathogenesis of foodborne pathogens.
