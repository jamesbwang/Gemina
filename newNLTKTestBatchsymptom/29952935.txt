 Social<GPE> disadvantage is associated with markers of physiological dysregulation, which is linked to disease trajectories. Chronic experiences with discrimination are thought to result in the accumulation of physiological `` wear and tear '' known as allostatic load ( AL<ORGANIZATION> ) among socially marginalized populations such as sexual minorities. Using a nationally representative US<GSP> sample, we examined whether ( 1 ) people who self-identified as homosexual or bisexual display higher levels of AL<ORGANIZATION> than heterosexual individuals and ( 2 ) subgroups of sexual identity would further differ from each other as a consequence of distinct experiences of marginalization. We use data from the 2001-2010 National Health<ORGANIZATION> and Nutrition Examination Survey<ORGANIZATION>. Employing multivariate regression methods with sex-specific analyses, we examined AL<ORGANIZATION> score differences among lesbian/gay ( n = 211 ), bisexual ( n = 307 ), homosexually experienced ( n = 424 ), and exclusively heterosexual ( n = 12,969 ) individuals, adjusting for possible confounding due to demographics, health indicators, and, among men, HIV<ORGANIZATION> infection status. Results indicate that elevated AL<ORGANIZATION> was more common in bisexual men compared with exclusively heterosexual men ( adjusted β = 0.25, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.05 to 0.44 ), with significantly higher levels of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c<ORGANIZATION> ( adjusted odd ratio = 3.51, 95 % CI = 1.46-7.92 ) and systolic blood pressure ( adjusted odd ratio = 2.07, 95 % CI = 1.02 to 4.18 ). Gay-identified men evidenced significantly lower AL ( adjusted β = -0.22, 95 % CI = -0.41 to -0.04 ). No significant differences in AL were observed among women. These findings indicate that physiological dysregulation is more common in bisexual males compared with all other men. The results are discussed with regard to differences in health outcomes between individuals with different sexual orientations.
