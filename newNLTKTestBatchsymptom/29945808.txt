 Anticoagulantion therapy ( OAT<ORGANIZATION> ) represents the cornerstone to reduce thromboembolic events for atrial fibrillation ( AF ). Recent studies suggest that AF<ORGANIZATION> catheter ablation on top of OAT<ORGANIZATION> may be useful to further reduce the thromboembolic risk in AF patients. The aim of the present study is to compare the long-term risk of thromboembolic events and treatment-related complications in patients with AF<ORGANIZATION> treated by OAT<ORGANIZATION> strategies and catheter ablation. Pubmed<PERSON>, Cochrane<PERSON> and Google Scholar<PERSON> were searched for studies including > 500 patients evaluating AF patients treated with OAT<ORGANIZATION> ( VKA<ORGANIZATION>: vitamin K antagonist or DOAC: Direct oral anticoagulants ) and/or AF ablation. Pooled incidence of stroke/year was the primary end point, while that of stroke, of all cause bleeding and of major bleeding the secondary ones. All the analyses were stratified according to the CHADS Overall<ORGANIZATION>, 27 studies were selected, including 50,973 patients in the AF<ORGANIZATION> catheter ablation group ; 281,595 patients in the VKA<ORGANIZATION> group ; 54,811 patients in the DOAC<ORGANIZATION> group. After a mean follow-up of 2.4 ( 1.5-3.8 ) years, the overall incidence of stroke and thromboembolic events was 0.63 per 100 patients/year in AF<GPE> ablation group, 2.09 per 100 patients/year in VKA<ORGANIZATION> group and 1.24 per 100 patients/year in DOAC<ORGANIZATION> group ( p < 0.001 ). After stratification in 4 groups according to CHADS<ORGANIZATION> AF catheter ablation significantly reduces the incidence of long-term thromboembolic events compared to both VKA<ORGANIZATION> and DOAC<ORGANIZATION>. This reduction is maintained in all CHADS
