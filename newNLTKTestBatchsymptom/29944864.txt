 Corin<GPE> is a type II transmembrane serine protease that is highly expressed in the heart and plays a physiological role in the activation of natriuretic peptides. Corin<PERSON> is expressed primarily in myocytes, and it can enter the circulation. Circulating soluble corin has been found to be associated with various cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, preeclampsia, and stroke. All these findings indicate that circulating soluble corin has the potential to be a sensitive and specific biomarker for risk prediction and prognostic assessment of cardiovascular diseases. However, there are certain challenges hindering the incorporation of circulating soluble corin into clinical practice. To provide new ideas based on the use of corin for risk prediction, prognostic assessment, and clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases and to promote the implementation of corin as a routine laboratory index, we summarize the latest studies of the association between corin and cardiovascular diseases in recent years and offer some prospective proposals for future research on corin in this review.
