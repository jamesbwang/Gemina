 Intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most feared complication in patients treated with oral anticoagulants due to non-valvular atrial fibrillation ( NVAF<ORGANIZATION> ). Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants ( NOACs<ORGANIZATION> ) reduce the risk of ICH<ORGANIZATION> compared to vitamin K antagonists ( VKAs<ORGANIZATION> ). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of fatal NOAC-related ICH compared to VKA-related ICH. We calculated the corresponding risk ratios ( RRs<ORGANIZATION> ) in each included study to express the relative risk of fatal ICH<ORGANIZATION> among all patients receiving oral anticoagulation with either NOACs or VKAs<ORGANIZATION>. We additionally evaluated the mortality rates in NOAC-related and VKA-related ICH in patients treated with and without NOAC-specific reversal agents ( idarucizumab and factor Xa inhibitors antidote ). Case<PERSON> fatality was evaluated at 30-90 days following symptom onset. Our literature search identified 6 eligible studies ( 4 RCTs<ORGANIZATION> and 2 open-label trials of NOAC-specific reversal agents ). In pairwise analyses NOACs<ORGANIZATION> were found to have lower risk of fatal ICH<ORGANIZATION> compared to VKAs<ORGANIZATION> ( RR=0.46, 95 % CI: 0.36-0.58 ) with no heterogeneity ( I NOACs halve the risk of fatal ICH in NVAF<ORGANIZATION> patients compared to VKAs<ORGANIZATION>, while indirect comparisons indicate that NOAC-specific reversal agents may be associated with lower case fatality rate in NOAC-related ICH.
