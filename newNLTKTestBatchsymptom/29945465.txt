 A recent meta-analysis identified a prospective association between depression and cardiovascular disease ; however, there was no association for studies with long-term follow-up periods. The literature has primarily focused on baseline depression status or symptoms, which may not capture the chronic nature of depression. This study examined the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and cardiovascular disease up to 15 years later in 274 cardiovascular disease-free older adults. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, mean arterial pressure, and cardiovascular disease status were assessed. Baseline<PERSON> and chronic depressive symptoms predicted increased risk of cardiovascular disease, underscoring the importance of assessing and treating depression in older adults.
