 The procedure of apheresis in pediatric patients, particularly in those with low weight ( body weight < 10 kg ) presents an important challenge due to particularities of this group. There are no specific guidelines or enough scientific evidence to standardize the practice in this group of patients. In addition to the psychological aspect, the correct calculation of the total blood volume, the extracorporeal volume of the cell separator and an estimated decrease in hematocrit must be considered. Personalized protocols for priming of the apheresis equipment, sufficient blood flow and adequate anticoagulation are essential for patient comfort and therapeutic success. The purpose of this article is to present the results of the national study of apheresis practices in low weight group of children conducted from 2012 to 2018. Protocols and patients ' data collected from various apheresis centers in Argentina<GPE> were compared with the apheresis protocols around the world. Our protocols and data were similar to those in other countries ; however, no detailed and specific guidelines for apheresis practices in this population of patients with unique requirements have been developed to date.
