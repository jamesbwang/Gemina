 Hypertension<GPE> is an independent risk factor for diabetic retinopathy, yet anti-hypertensive medications such as blockade of angiotensin II do not completely protect against vision-threatening vascular disease. We hypothesized that the potent vasoactive factor, endothelin ( ET ), is up-regulated in diabetic retinopathy and antagonism of the ET<ORGANIZATION> type A receptor ( ETRA<ORGANIZATION> ) or ET type B receptor ( ETRB<ORGANIZATION> ) ameliorates retinal vascular leakage independently of any blood pressure lowering effects. Spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR<ORGANIZATION> ) and their normotensive and genetic controls, Wistar Kyoto<PERSON> rats, were randomized to become diabetic or non-diabetic and studied for 8 weeks. Rats were further randomized to receive by intravitreal injection the ETRA<ORGANIZATION> antagonist, BQ123<ORGANIZATION>, the ETRB<ORGANIZATION> antagonist, BQ788<ORGANIZATION>, or vehicle, 5 days after the induction of streptozotocin diabetes and 4 weeks later. The treatments had no effect on systolic blood pressure which remained elevated in SHR<ORGANIZATION>. ET-1, ET-2, ETRA<ORGANIZATION> and ETRB<ORGANIZATION> were expressed in retina and retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE<ORGANIZATION> ) /choroid and increased by hypertension or diabetes. BQ123<ORGANIZATION> reduced ET-1 and ET-2 expression in retina and RPE/choroid, while BQ788<ORGANIZATION> had a similar effect but did not influence the mRNA<ORGANIZATION> levels of ET-1 in retina. Retinal vascular leakage and MÃ¼ller<PERSON> cell stress as well as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF<ORGANIZATION> ) expression in retina and RPE/choroid, were increased by hypertension or diabetes and there was an additive effect of these conditions. Treatment with BQ123<ORGANIZATION> or BQ788<ORGANIZATION> effectively reduced these events as well as the elevated levels of inflammatory factors in the retina. Our findings indicate that local ET systems exist in the retina and RPE/choroid that are up-regulated by hypertension and diabetes. The ability of locally delivered ET receptor antagonists to supress these overactive ET systems and reduce retinal vascular leakage and VEGF<ORGANIZATION> in the presence of hypertension indicate the potential of these approaches for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
