 Sacroiliac<GPE> joint ( SIJ<ORGANIZATION> ) pain has been identified as a primary or contributing source of pain in patients with low back pain. The Laslett<ORGANIZATION> cluster of SIJ<ORGANIZATION> pain provocation tests has the strongest evidence for noninvasive clinical testing. The purpose of this report was to describe the impact of physical therapy treatments for a patient postpartum with SIJ<ORGANIZATION> pain who satisfied the Laslett<ORGANIZATION> cluster. Specifically, the goal was to assess the impact of progressive pelvic floor muscle exercise and manual therapy. The Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire<ORGANIZATION> ( MODI<ORGANIZATION> ) was the primary outcome measure used in this case. In addition, the Numeric Pain<ORGANIZATION> Rating Scale ( NRPS<ORGANIZATION> ) and Global Rating<PERSON> of Change<GPE> ( GROC<ORGANIZATION> ) were used as secondary outcome measures. In this case report, the patient responded to the combined interventions with decreases in MODI<GPE>, NRPS<ORGANIZATION> and GROC<ORGANIZATION>. Further<PERSON> research is warranted to develop stronger evidence to identify specific interventions for the treatment of SIJ<ORGANIZATION> pain.
