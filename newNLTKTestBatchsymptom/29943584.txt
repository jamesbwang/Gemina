 Recent years have seen a change in the relative prevalence of environmental and contagious intramammary pathogens, as well as a change in the relative number of total mixed ration ( TMR<ORGANIZATION> ) -based and pasture ( PAS<ORGANIZATION> ) -based dairies in South Africa<GPE>. The objectives of the study were to determine and compare the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in TMR<ORGANIZATION> and PAS<ORGANIZATION> dairies in South Africa<GPE> during 2008 and 2013 ; furthermore, the within-herd prevalence of Streptococcus<GPE> uberis in Str<GPE>. uberis-positive herds was determined and compared. The prevalence of each pathogen, as well as the within-herd prevalence of Str<GPE>. uberis, were compared between the two years and the two management systems using bacterial culture results from routinely collected composite cow milk samples submitted to the Onderstepoort Milk Laboratory<ORGANIZATION>, Faculty<PERSON> of Veterinary Science<ORGANIZATION>, University<ORGANIZATION> of Pretoria<GPE>. Coagulase-negative staphylococci had the highest prevalence in both TMR<ORGANIZATION> and PAS<ORGANIZATION> dairies for both 2008 ( 29.60 % [ 95.00 % CI: 28.80 % - 30.40 % ] and 26.90 % [ 95.00 % CI: 25.50 % - 28.30 % ], respectively ) and 2013 ( 20.20 % [ 95.00 % CI: 19.30 % - 21.10 % ] and 22.70 % [ 95.00 % CI: 22.20 % - 23.10 % ], respectively ), which decreased significantly from 2008 to 2013 in both TMR<ORGANIZATION> and PAS<ORGANIZATION> dairies ( p < 0.001 ). Streptococcus uberis showed an increase in prevalence in both TMR ( p = 0.002 ) and PAS<ORGANIZATION> dairies ( p = 0.001 ) from 2008 ( 2.36 % [ 95.00 % CI: 2.10 % - 2.65 % ] and 2.63 % [ 95.00 % CI: 2.16 % - 3.16 % ], respectively ) to 2013 ( 3.10 % [ 95.00 % CI: 2.72 % - 3.51 % ] and 3.64 % [ 95.00 % CI: 3.45 % - 3.83 % ], respectively ). Staphylococcus<PERSON> aureusshowed a significant decrease in both TMR ( p = 0.011 ) and PAS<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.001 ) dairies from 2008 ( 4.71 % [ 95.00 % CI: 4.34 % - 5.10 % ] and 5.62 % [ 95.00 % CI: 4.94 % - 6.36 % ], respectively ) to 2013 ( 3.95 % [ 95.00 % CI: 3.52 % - 4.40 % ] and 1.71 % [ 95.00 % CI: 1.58 % - 1.84 % ], respectively ). The median within-herd prevalence of Str<GPE>. uberis for the combined dairy systems showed a significant increase from 2008 ( 1.72 % [ IQR: 0.88 % - 5.00 % ] ) to 2013 ( 3.10 % [ IQR: 1.72 % - 4.70 % ] ) ( p < 0.001 ). Statistically significant differences were found in the prevalence of most of the major contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens between 2008 and 2013 and between TMR<ORGANIZATION> and PAS<ORGANIZATION> dairies. The within-herd prevalence of Str<GPE>. uberis increased from 2008 to 2013, with the highest within-herd prevalence in PAS<ORGANIZATION> dairies in 2013.
