 This study was carried out to assess the effects of a blend of herbal essential oils ( namely Thymus<GPE> vulgaris, Mentha<GPE> piperita, Rosmarinus<PERSON> offisinalis and Anethum<GPE> graveolens ) and different dietary lipid sources on the performance, ileal bacterial enumeration, intestinal histological alterations and immune responses in laying hens. For this purpose, a total of 150 laying hens were randomly allocated to six experimental treatments with five replicates of five birds each. Dietary treatments consisted of three levels of a mixture of essential oils ( 0, 100 and 200 mg/kg ) and two sources of lipid ( soybean oil and fish oil containing different ratios of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ) fed to the animals during an 80-days feeding trial. Findings<PERSON> indicated that dietary administration of fish oil not only increased significantly the spleen relative weight ( p < 0.01 ) and the antibody titre against Newcastle<GPE> virus ( p < 0.05 ) but also led to reductions in liver relative weight ( p < 0.05 ) and feed conversion ratio ( p < 0.05 ). Moreover, the mixture of herbal essential oils brought about declines in hepatic relative weight, heterophile to lymphocyte ratio ( p < 0.05 ) and intestinal pathogen populations ( p < 0.01 ). Mention<PERSON> must also be made of the improvements it made in spleen weight ( p < 0.01 ), antibody titres against SRBC<ORGANIZATION> ( p < 0.01 ) and Newcastle<GPE> virus ( p < 0.05 ), villus height to crypt depth ratio ( p < 0.01 ), goblet cell numbers ( p < 0.05 ), lamina propria lymphatic follicle diameters ( p < 0.01 ) and feed conversion ratio ( p = 0.06 ). It may be claimed that the enhancements observed in the performance of laying hens fed fish oil and 200 mg/kg of the blend of essential oils could have potentially been associated with improved intestinal health indices as well as cellular and humoral immune responses.
