 Even though the efficacy of melodic intonation therapy ( MIT<ORGANIZATION> ) with persons with aphasia ( PWA<ORGANIZATION> ) has been explored in different languages, the efficacy of MIT<ORGANIZATION> with Arabic-speaking PWA has never been explored. Aims: To explore the efficacy of MIT<ORGANIZATION>, adapted to Arabic<PERSON>, in promoting the expressive abilities of a 70-year-old Jordanian<PERSON> Arabic-speaking male subject with severe Broca<PERSON> 's aphasia 3 months post-onset. Methods: An 8-week MIT<ORGANIZATION> therapy programme with tapping ( 1.5 h daily, 6 days a week ) was used in a multiple baseline design across two types of trained phrases ( i.e. automatic and self-generated phrases ). Outcome measures included accuracy of production of trained ( at the end of each session ) and untrained phrases ( at the end of each week ). Pre- and post-treatment measures used, were the bilingual aphasia test, the American<ORGANIZATION> Speech-Language Hearing Association Functional Assessment of Communicative Skills<ORGANIZATION>, the communicative effectiveness index and the American Speech<ORGANIZATION> and Hearing Association Quality of Communication Life Scale<ORGANIZATION>. Accuracy of production for the trained and untrained phrases was also measured 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the treatment programme was finished. Results: The patient, ( MK ), improved his expressive productions post-treatment in automatic and self-generated phrases. Automatic phrases exceeded the established 75 % accuracy criterion, whereas the self-generated phrases reached criterion and remained constant at follow-up. Moreover, MK<ORGANIZATION> gradually started improving on the generalisation stimuli, once the treatment on the self-generated phrases started and maintained the gains 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-treatment. Conclusion: MIT<ORGANIZATION> appears to be a viable treatment option for Jordanian<GPE> Arabic-speaking persons with Broca<PERSON> 's aphasia. However, more research is needed with larger groups of Jordanian<GPE> Arabic-speaking persons with Broca<PERSON> 's aphasia to provide more support to the present findings. Moreover, future studies might focus on the efficacy of MIT<ORGANIZATION> with persons with Broca<PERSON> 's aphasia from different Arab<PERSON> countries and from countries where Arabic<PERSON> is part of the multicultural structure like South Africa<GPE> and other countries on the African<GPE> continent.
