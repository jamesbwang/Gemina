 An 51-year-old female presented with a headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. The lesion resembling a hemorrhagic mass was observed in the brain tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the patient. However, thrombosis was suspected in the cerebral venules adjacent to the lesion. Magnetic<PERSON> resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance perfusion data excluded neoplastic lesions. Thus, the patient was treated for venous infarction. Hemorrhagic venous infarcts may mimic hemorrhagic masses. For this reason, the distinction of the lesions is important for the treatment procedure. Advanced neuroimaging in lesions resembling hemorrhagic masses must be performed for accurate diagnosis.
