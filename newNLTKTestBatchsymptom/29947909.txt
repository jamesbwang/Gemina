 Ellagic<GPE> acid ( EGA<ORGANIZATION> ) -enriched dietary supplements are widely acclaimed, owing to its versatile bioactivities. Previously, we reported that chronic administration of EGA<ORGANIZATION> prevented the impairment of cognitive abilities in rats using the intracerebroventricular-administered streptozotocin ( STZ-ICV ) model of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease. Impairment of phosphoinositide 3 ( PI3<ORGANIZATION> ) -kinase-regulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS<ORGANIZATION> ) activity by central administration of STZ<ORGANIZATION> in rodents instigates dementia. The aim of the present study was to delineate the role of PI3-kinase-eNOS activity in the prevention of STZ-ICV-induced memory dysfunctions by EGA<ORGANIZATION>. The Morris<GPE> water maze and elevated plus maze tests were conducted, and brain oxidative stress markers ( TBARS<ORGANIZATION>, GSH<ORGANIZATION>, SOD<ORGANIZATION>, CAT<ORGANIZATION> ), nitrite, acetylcholinesterase ( AChE<ORGANIZATION> ), LDH<ORGANIZATION>, TNF-α and eNOS<ORGANIZATION> were quantified. Administration<ORGANIZATION> of EGA<ORGANIZATION> ( 35 mg/k, p.o. ) for 4 weeks daily attenuated the STZ-ICV ( 3 mg/kg ) -triggered increase of brain oxidative stress, nitrite and TNF-α levels ; AChE<ORGANIZATION> and LDH<ORGANIZATION> activity ; and decline of brain eNOS<ORGANIZATION> activity. The memory restoration by EGA<ORGANIZATION> in STZ-ICV-treated rats was conspicuously impaired by N
