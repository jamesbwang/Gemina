 Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides capable of forming inclusion complexes with a variety of molecules, and as such have been recognized as a pharmaceutical and biotechnological asset. Cyclodextrins are known to interact with the components of cell membranes, and this correlates with a significant degree of cytotoxicity. In this work, we report on the mechanism of degradation of a model dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine ( DOPC<ORGANIZATION> ) bilayer exposed to a solution with increasing concentrations of Î±-cyclodextrins. By combining optical fluorescence microscopy and quartz-crystal microbalance experiments, we study the evolution of supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs<ORGANIZATION> ) and giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs<ORGANIZATION> ). The rate of lipid removal is found to display a strong nonlinear dependence on the cyclodextrin concentration. A mechanism involving lipid aggregates is proposed.
