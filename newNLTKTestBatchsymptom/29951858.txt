 The biodegradation of polyhydroxybutyrate ( PHB<ORGANIZATION> ) has been broadly investigated, but studies typically focus on a single strain or enzyme and little attention has been paid to comparing the interaction of different PHB<ORGANIZATION> depolymerase ( PhaZ<ORGANIZATION> ) -producing strains with this biopolymer. In this work, we selected nine bacterial strains-five with demonstrated and four with predicted PhaZ<ORGANIZATION> activity-to compare their effectiveness at degrading PHB<ORGANIZATION> film provided as sole carbon source. Each of the strains with demonstrated activity were able to use the PHB<ORGANIZATION> film ( maximum mass losses ranging from 12 % after 2 days for Paucimonas<PERSON> lemoignei to 90 % after 4 days for Cupriavidus<ORGANIZATION> sp. ), and to a lower extent Marinobacter algicola DG893<ORGANIZATION> ( with a predicted PhaZ ) achieved PHB<ORGANIZATION> film mass loss of 11 % after 2 weeks of exposure. Among the strains with proven PhaZ<ORGANIZATION> activity, Ralstonia<GPE> sp. showed the highest specific activity since less biomass was required to degrade the polymer in comparison to the other strains. In the case of Ralstonia<GPE> sp., PHB<ORGANIZATION> continued to be degraded at pH<ORGANIZATION> values as low as pH<ORGANIZATION> 3.3-3.7. In addition, analysis of the extracellular fractions of the strains with demonstrated activity showed that Comamonas<ORGANIZATION> testosteroni, Cupriavidus<GPE> sp., and Ralstonia<GPE> sp. readily degraded both PHB<ORGANIZATION> film and PHB<ORGANIZATION> particles in agar suspensions. This study highlights that whole cell cultures and enzymatic ( extracellular ) fractions display different levels of activity, an important factor in the development of PHB-based applications and in understanding the fate of PHB<ORGANIZATION> and other PHAs<ORGANIZATION> released in the environment. Furthermore, predictions of PhaZ<ORGANIZATION> functionality from genome sequencing analyses remain to be validated by experimental results ; PHB-degrading ability could not be proven for three of four investigated species predicted by the polyhydroxyalkanoates ( PHA<ORGANIZATION> ) depolymerase engineering database.
