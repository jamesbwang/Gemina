 The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS<ORGANIZATION> ) on work productivity in female workers. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using eight electronic databases ( MEDLINE<ORGANIZATION>, PEDro<ORGANIZATION>, CINAHL<ORGANIZATION>, Cochrane<GPE> library, EMBASE<ORGANIZATION>, PubMed<ORGANIZATION>, Scopus<GPE>, and PsycINFO<ORGANIZATION> ) to identify articles published before July 2017 that studied the work productivity in female workers with LUTS<ORGANIZATION>. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute<ORGANIZATION>. Meta-analyses were performed on studies having measured work productivity between females with and without LUTS<ORGANIZATION>, and odds ratios ( ORs<ORGANIZATION> ) or the mean differences were used. Fourteen articles ( n = 48 223 females ) were included in the review, and meta-analyses were performed with six of those articles. Lower urinary tract symptoms were significantly associated with work productivity loss ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.11, 95 % CI = 1.06-1.15 ), presenteeism ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.10, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.14 ), and activity impairment ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.11, 95 % CI = 1.09-1.14 ). However, there was no significant difference in the probability of absenteeism between females with and without LUTS<ORGANIZATION> ( OR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.03, 95 % CI = 0.94-1.13 ). Evidence suggests that female workers with LUTS<ORGANIZATION> had significantly greater work productivity impairment compared to those without LUTS<ORGANIZATION>.
