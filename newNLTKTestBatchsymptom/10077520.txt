 Whereas<GPE> statistical association of hepatitis C virus ( HCV<ORGANIZATION> ) infection with cardiomyopathy is long known, establishment of a causal relationship has not been achieved so far. Patients with advanced heart failure ( HF ) are mostly unable to tolerate interferon ( IFN<ORGANIZATION> ) -based treatment, resulting in limited experience regarding the possible pathogenic role of HCV<ORGANIZATION> in this patient group. HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection often triggers disease in a broad spectrum of extrahepatic organs, with innate immune and autoimmune pathogenic processes involved. The fact that worldwide more than 70 million patients are chronically infected with HCV<ORGANIZATION> illustrates the possible clinical impact arising if cardiomyopathies were induced or aggravated by HCV<ORGANIZATION>, resulting in progressive HF or severe arrhythmias. A novel path has been opened to finally resolve the long-standing question of cause-effect relationship between HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection and cardiac dysfunction, by the recent development of IFN-free, highly efficient, and well tolerable anti-HCV regimens. The new direct-acting antiviral ( DAA<ORGANIZATION> ) agents are highly virus-specific and lack unspecific side-effects upon cardiac function which have always confounded the interpretation of IFN<ORGANIZATION> treatment data. The actual frequency of unexplained HF in chronic HCV<ORGANIZATION> infection will be determined from a planned large-scale study. Whereas such patients probably constitute a rather small fraction of all those harboring HCV<ORGANIZATION>, they have major clinical relevance. It is not yet known which fraction of these patients will significantly benefit from HCV<ORGANIZATION> eradication, but this issue will be addressed now in a prospective study.
