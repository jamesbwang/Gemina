 There is a dearth of obesity study among sub-Saharan African<GPE> immigrants in Seoul<GPE>, Korea<GPE>. We investigated the prevalence and perception of obesity among this population. A cross-sectional study involving 211 immigrants aged 20 years and above from sub-Saharan Africa<PERSON> was carried out, using a structured questionnaire. Obesity ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ≥ 30.0 kg/m² ) was calculated as the primary outcome variable. The overall prevalence of obesity was 27.0 % ( men 22.6 % and women 36.8 % ). In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, obesity was significantly associated with increased duration of residence. Participants were 4.03 ( 95 % CI 1.63-9.94 ) more likely to disagree than agree that obesity is a sign of wealth and that it gives respect. There is an urgent need to assess the possible factors predisposing sub-Saharan Africans to obesity and interventions should be designed targeting their lifestyle modification for healthy weight.
