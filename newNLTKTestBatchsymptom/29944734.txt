 The diagnosis of breast cancer ( BC ) is based on clinical examination in combination with imaging and confirmed by pathological assessment of core needle biopsy ( CNB<ORGANIZATION> ) or fine needle aspiration biopsy ( FNAB<ORGANIZATION> ). The biological profile of the lesion is needed to define the prognosis and establish therapy. Given the importance of an early and minimally invasive diagnosis, we aimed to verify whether the biological features detected in FNAB-derived cytological material reflect the biological characteristics of surgical specimens. We used immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH<ORGANIZATION> ) to study a panel of conventional biomarkers ( ER<ORGANIZATION>, PgR<ORGANIZATION>, Ki67<PERSON> and HER2<ORGANIZATION> ) in FNAB-derived cytological specimens included in cell blocks of 93 BC patients, comparing results with those obtained from the histological evaluation of the same parameters. Median<GPE> immunopositive values of ER<ORGANIZATION>, PgR<ORGANIZATION> and Ki67<PERSON> were similar in cell blocks and surgical samples. The concordance of ER<ORGANIZATION> and PgR<ORGANIZATION> between FNAB<ORGANIZATION> and histological samples was 98 % and 84 %, respectively. With regard to Ki67<GPE> and HER2<ORGANIZATION> status, concordance between the two specimen types was 90 % and 96 %, respectively. Tumor<PERSON> subtype classification for triple-negative and HER2-positive tumors in FNAB<ORGANIZATION> samples was always concordant with the subtype determined in surgical material. We demonstrated that biological marker determination in FNAB-derived cell blocks is feasible and provides useful information and comparable results to those obtained by histological evaluation. Given the low cost of the procedure and its minimal impact on patients, we believe that cytological samples could be used as an alternative to tissue samples for early BC biomarker evaluation.
