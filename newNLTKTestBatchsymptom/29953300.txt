 To describe with multimodal imaging a case of post-infectious unilateral outer retinopathy with choroiditis. Retrospective chart review of a case of a 67-year old male who presented following the onset of viral symptoms with an acute onset outer retinopathy, small vessel leakage on fluorescein angiography, and choroidal involvement evident on indocyanine green angiography and near infrared fundus autofluorescence ( NIR-AF ). Work up for infectious and autoimmune etiologies was negative. Treatment with IV<ORGANIZATION> methylprednisolone followed by high dose oral prednisone resulted in improvement in visual acuity, outer retinal reconstitution and resolution of the choroidal changes. Despite this presentation sharing features with both acute zonal occult outer retinopathy ( AZOOR<ORGANIZATION> ) and multifocal choroiditis ( MFC<ORGANIZATION> ), the case is highly atypical of both entities.
