 The objective of this study was to investigate the influences of filler content and size on the translucency parameter of non-layered resin composites. Three types of fillers ( 0.7 μm, 1.0 μm and 1.5 μm ) were mixed at weight contents of 60wt %, 70wt %, 75wt %, and 80wt %. The L*, a* and b* value was analyzed based on CIELab<ORGANIZATION> color space of the specimen respectively on black and white background. The results of each test were analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey<PERSON> 's HSD<ORGANIZATION> test using SPSS<ORGANIZATION> 20.0 software package. For each filler size, there was a trend of decreasing translucency parameter as the filler content increased ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). The filler size did not affect the translucency parameter of the composites in this study. When the fillers content changed from 60wt % to 80wt %, there is a trend of decreasing translucency parameter as the filler content increased, and the filler size may not influence the translucency parameter of the composites when the size changed from 0.7 μm to 1.5 μm.
