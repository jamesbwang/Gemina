 Down<GPE> syndrome, caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is the single most common risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer 's disease. Worldwide<PERSON> approximately 6 million people have Down<PERSON> syndrome, and all these individuals will develop the hallmark amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease by the age of 40 and the vast majority will go on to develop dementia. Triplication of APP<ORGANIZATION>, a gene on chromosome 21, is sufficient to cause early-onset Alzheimer 's disease in the absence of Down<GPE> syndrome. However, whether triplication of other chromosome 21 genes influences disease pathogenesis in the context of Down<GPE> syndrome is unclear. Here we show, in a mouse model, that triplication of chromosome 21 genes other than APP<ORGANIZATION> increases amyloid-β aggregation, deposition of amyloid-β plaques and worsens associated cognitive deficits. This indicates that triplication of chromosome 21 genes other than APP<ORGANIZATION> is likely to have an important role to play in Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease pathogenesis in individuals who have Down<PERSON> syndrome. We go on to show that the effect of trisomy of chromosome 21 on amyloid-β aggregation correlates with an unexpected shift in soluble amyloid-β 40/42 ratio. This alteration in amyloid-β isoform ratio occurs independently of a change in the carboxypeptidase activity of the γ-secretase complex, which cleaves the peptide from APP<ORGANIZATION>, or the rate of extracellular clearance of amyloid-β. These new mechanistic insights into the role of triplication of genes on chromosome 21, other than APP<ORGANIZATION>, in the development of Alzheimer<GPE> 's disease in individuals who have Down<PERSON> syndrome may have implications for the treatment of this common cause of neurodegeneration.
