 Based on the theory of `` overexertion leading to Qi<GPE> consumption '', this study aimed to compare the intervention factors of nervous and physical fatigue to establish a rat model of Qi<GPE> deficiency syndrome, moreover, the systematic evaluationsystem was necessary with the standard of syndrome diagnosis of Qi<GPE> deficiency. According to the clinical-mimetic principle the Qi deficiency syndrome animal model is established by the factors of sleep deprivation ( SD ) and exhaustive swimming ( ES ). Rats were randomly divided into four groups, normal group, SD<ORGANIZATION> group, ES<ORGANIZATION> group and compound group ( exhaustion swimming complex sleep deprivation ). The method of ES<ORGANIZATION> was force rats to swim until the exhaustion with 5 % of weight, and the SD<ORGANIZATION> method by using multi-platform sleep deprivation of water environment randomly 14-16 h daily, and the complex set by using of two methods was combined. The movement distance, average speed, activity time and numbers into the central area were detected by open field test, swimming exhaustion time was detected by swimming exhaustion method, the cardiac function ( LVEF<ORGANIZATION>, CO<ORGANIZATION>, FS<ORGANIZATION>, LVDd<ORGANIZATION> ) was detected by echocardiography, tongue imaging analysis and pulsedistention as the index of tongue and pulse diagnosis, the content of ATP<ORGANIZATION> and ADP<ORGANIZATION> in serum was detected by ELISA<ORGANIZATION>, the blood coagulation indexes for blood stasis syndrome as the additional. These results indicated that independent activity, body weight and exercise capacity were decreased significantly, the neurological function injured significantly, heart function was decreased significantly, the tongue surface color was pale white, and the pulse distention was decreased significantly. The content of ATP<ORGANIZATION> decreased significantly and the ADP<ORGANIZATION> increased significantly. By the method of four-diagnostic evaluation system to compare the factors of SD<ORGANIZATION> and ES<ORGANIZATION>, the Qi deficiency syndrome animalmodel could be successfully established by sleep deprivation method.
