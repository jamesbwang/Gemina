 Gastric<GPE> adenoma ( GA ) is a premalignant lesion that precedes intestinal-type gastric carcinoma ( GC ). However, genetic progression mechanisms from GA<ORGANIZATION> to GC have not been clarified. We performed whole-exome sequencing-based mutational analyses for 15 synchronous pairs of attached GAs<ORGANIZATION> and GCs<ORGANIZATION>. There was no significant difference in the number of driver mutations or copy number alterations between GAs<ORGANIZATION> and GCs<ORGANIZATION>. Well-known mutations of The preferred sequence of mutational events during GA-to-GC progression might be more context-dependent than colon adenoma progression. Our results show that non-clonal synchronous GA/GC is common, and that GA<ORGANIZATION> genomes have already acquired distinct genomic alterations, suggesting caution in the diagnosis of synchronous GA and GC<ORGANIZATION>, especially in residual or recurrent cases.
