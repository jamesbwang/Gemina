 Today, invasive and non-invasive home mechanical ventilation have become a well-established treatment option. Consequently, in 2010, the German Respiratory Society<ORGANIZATION> ( Deutsche Gesellschaft<ORGANIZATION> f√ºr Pneumologie und Beatmungsmedizin<PERSON>, DGP<ORGANIZATION> ) has leadingly published the Guidelines<ORGANIZATION> on `` Non-Invasive and Invasive Mechanical Ventilation<ORGANIZATION> for Treatment<ORGANIZATION> of Chronic Respiratory Failure<PERSON>. '' However, continuing technical evolutions, new scientific insights, and health care developments require an extensive revision of the Guidelines<ORGANIZATION>. For this reason, the updated Guidelines are now published. Thereby, the existing chapters, namely technical issues, organizational structures in Germany<GPE>, qualification criteria, disease-specific recommendations including special features in pediatrics as well as ethical aspects and palliative care, have been updated according to the current literature and the health care developments in Germany<GPE>. New chapters added to the Guidelines<ORGANIZATION> include the topics of home mechanical ventilation in paraplegic patients and in those with failure of prolonged weaning. In the current Guidelines<ORGANIZATION>, different societies as well as professional and expert associations have been involved when compared to the 2010 Guidelines. Importantly, disease-specific aspects are now covered by the German<ORGANIZATION> Interdisciplinary Society of Home Mechanical Ventilation<PERSON> ( DIGAB<ORGANIZATION> ). In addition, societies and associations directly involved in the care of patients receiving home mechanical ventilation have been included in the current process. Importantly, associations responsible for decisions on costs in the health care system and patient organizations have now been involved.
