 Targeting neuroinflammatory disturbances has been acknowledged as a potential strategy for treatment of depressive disorder in humans. Over-activation of tryptophan-degrading pathway by pro-inflammatory cytokines resulted in N-methyl-d-aspartate ( NMDA<ORGANIZATION> ) -mediated excitotoxicity, which is implicated in pathophysiology of depression. Gentiopicroside ( Gent ) has powerful anti-inflammatory property and exhibits promising antidepressant effect in an animal model of pain/depression dyad by down-regulating GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the ability of Gent to abolish depressive-like behavior induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION> ) in mice. Acute<PERSON> administration of LPS<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.5 mg/kg, i.p. ) increased immobility time in both forced swimming test ( FST<ORGANIZATION> ) and tail suspension test ( TST<ORGANIZATION> ) without affecting spontaneous locomotor activity, indicative of depressive-like behavior. Gent ( 50 mg/kg, i.p. ) administered once a day for three consecutive days prevented the development of depressive-like behavior induced by LPS<ORGANIZATION>. The antidepressant-like effect was paralleled with restoration of LPS-induced alterations in brain inflammatory mediators ( i.e. IL-1β and TNF-α ). In addition, Gent<ORGANIZATION> prevented over-activation of indoleamine 2,3-double oxygen enzyme ( IDO<ORGANIZATION> ) and recovered GluN2B<ORGANIZATION> subunit expression in the PFC<ORGANIZATION> challenged by LPS<ORGANIZATION>. In conclusion, our results suggested that Gent<ORGANIZATION> pretreatment provided protection against LPS-induced depressive-like behavior and the effect appeared to be demonstrated, at least partially, by blocking various steps of tryptophan-degrading pathway.
