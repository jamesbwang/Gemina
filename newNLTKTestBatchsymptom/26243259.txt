 Expert<GPE> clinicians and researchers in the field of spinal tuberculosis ( STB<ORGANIZATION> ) advocate for early identification and diagnosis as a key to reducing disability, severity of disease, expensive surgery and death, especially in tuberculosis ( TB ) endemic countries like South Africa<GPE>. South Africa<PERSON> has the highest incidence per capita of tuberculosis in the world, and a conservative estimate of the incidence of STB<ORGANIZATION> in South Africa<GPE> is 8-16:100 000. People living with STB<ORGANIZATION> may initially present to primary health care ( PHC<ORGANIZATION> ) centres, where the opportunity exists for early identification. Spinal pain is the most common presentation of STB<ORGANIZATION>, but even this symptom may not be present. Occasionally the only symptoms are neurological injury, dysphagia or referred pain. Computerised tomography-guided biopsy remains the diagnostic gold standard for STB<ORGANIZATION>. A narrative review was undertaken to investigate the evidence available that could assist with the early diagnosis of STB<ORGANIZATION>. Articles were searched for and retrieved from three databases and assessed for quality and relevance to primary settings in a TB endemic country. The following evidence-based, affordable and available tools could facilitate early diagnosis of STB<ORGANIZATION> at PHC<ORGANIZATION> and district hospital levels: ( 1 ) back pain screening questions, undressed spinal physical examination, HIV<ORGANIZATION> and antiretroviral therapy history, ( 2 ) erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, platelets, haemoglobin, white cell count ( WCC<ORGANIZATION> ), sputum for GeneXpert<ORGANIZATION> and accurate weight measurement, ( 3 ) physiotherapy and/or medical and/or speech therapy assessment, ( 4 ) full spinal radiograph, chest radiograph, abdominal ultrasound, urine lipoarabinomannan ( LAM<ORGANIZATION> ) if CD4<ORGANIZATION> < 200 and ultrasound-guided biopsy of superficial abscesses, ( 5 ) clear referral guidelines at all levels, ( 6 ) a positive response to treatment to confirm the diagnosis. These affordable and simple actions at PHC<ORGANIZATION> and district levels could facilitate earlier diagnosis of STB<ORGANIZATION>.
