Kim<PERSON>, Bahr Weiss<PERSON>, Victoria Ngo<PERSON> and Anna S. Lau<PERSON> ( Survey measures were administered to 375 Vietnamese American<GPE> adolescents ( 48.8 % males ; M = 15.55 years, SD<ORGANIZATION> = .59 ) at 3 time points over 6 months. Using cross-lagged path analysis, perceived acculturation conflict predicted externalizing symptoms, whereas internalizing symptoms predicted perceived acculturation conflict. Perceived<PERSON> maternal psychological control mediated the association between perceived acculturation conflict and later externalizing symptoms, whereas maternal psychological control, parental unresponsiveness, and unmet parent expectations mediated the association between internalizing symptoms and later acculturation conflict.
