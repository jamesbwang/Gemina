 To correlate interpedicular distance ( IPD<ORGANIZATION> ) with radiographic parameters, neurological deficit and posterior structures injury in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. One hundred three thoracolumbar burst fracture patients were retrospectively reviewed. IPD<ORGANIZATION> was measured from the medial sclerotic areas of the pedicles on anteroposterior plain radiographs. Data concerning local kyphosis ( LK ), the ratio of anterior to posterior vertebral height ( A/P ratio ), loss of vertebral body height ( LOVBH<ORGANIZATION> ) and spinal canal stenosis ( SCS<ORGANIZATION> ), neurological status and posterior structures ( lamina, posterior ligamentous complex and facet joint ) injury were correlated to IPD<ORGANIZATION> using correlation analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the threshold of IPD<ORGANIZATION> that is predictive of neurological deficit and posterior structures injury. A total of 95.15 % ( 98/103 ) of patients presented with increased IPD<ORGANIZATION>, ranging from 1.41 % to 41.53 %, with a mean of 10.92Â±3.37 %. Regarding radiographic parameters, both LK and SCS<ORGANIZATION> were linearly correlated with IPD<ORGANIZATION>. There was a significant correlation between IPD<ORGANIZATION> and neurological status ; logistic regression analysis showed that an IPD<ORGANIZATION> increase of greater than 20 % was an indicator for neurological deficit. In addition, both facet joint injury and lamina fracture were associated with IPD<ORGANIZATION>, with IPD<ORGANIZATION> increase exceeding 15 % being an indicator for facet joint injury and that exceeding 20 % being a predictor of lamina fracture. The results indicate that IPD<ORGANIZATION> correlates to LK, SCS<ORGANIZATION>, neurological status, facet joint injury and lamina fracture. Our data demonstrate that IPD<ORGANIZATION> measured from plain radiograph is a reliable indicator for assessment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
