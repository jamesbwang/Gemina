 Cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR<ORGANIZATION> ) can be used to calculate myocardial extracellular volume fraction ( ECV<ORGANIZATION> ) by relating the longitudinal relaxation rate in blood and myocardium before and after contrast-injection to hematocrit ( Hct ) in blood. Hematocrit<PERSON> is known to vary with body posture, which could affect the calculations of ECV<ORGANIZATION>. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that there is a significant increase in calculated ECV<ORGANIZATION> values if the Hct<ORGANIZATION> is sampled after the CMR<ORGANIZATION> examination in supine position compared to when the patient arrives at the MR department. Forty-three consecutive patients including various pathologies as well as normal findings were included in the study. Venous<PERSON> blood samples were drawn upon arrival to the MR department and directly after the examination with the patient remaining in supine position. A Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery ( MOLLI<ORGANIZATION> ) protocol was used to acquire mid-ventricular short-axis images before and after contrast injection from which motion-corrected T1 maps were derived and ECV<ORGANIZATION> was calculated. Hematocrit<PERSON> decreased from 44.0 ± 3.7 % before to 40.6 ± 4.0 % after the CMR<ORGANIZATION> examination ( p < 0.001 ). This resulted in a change in calculated ECV from 24.7 ± 3.8 % before to 26.2 ± 4.2 % after the CMR<ORGANIZATION> examination ( p < 0.001 ). All patients decreased in Hct<GPE> after the CMR<ORGANIZATION> examination compared to before except for two patients whose Hct<PERSON> remained the same. Variability in CMR-derived myocardial ECV can be reduced by standardizing the timing of Hct<GPE> measurement relative to the CMR<ORGANIZATION> examination. Thus, a standardized acquisition of blood sample for Hct after the CMR<ORGANIZATION> examination, when the patient is still in supine position, would increase the precision of ECV<ORGANIZATION> measurements.
