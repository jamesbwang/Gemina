 Adaptive<GPE> servo-ventilation ( ASV<ORGANIZATION> ) is a ventilator algorithm able to correct breathing through anticyclic support of breathing in patients with central sleep apnea ( CSA<ORGANIZATION> ). So far, very few data exist regarding the role of ASV<ORGANIZATION> on acute heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF<ORGANIZATION> ). We performed a single-center prospective, randomized, case-control study in consecutive acute HFpEF<ORGANIZATION> ( left ventricle ejection fraction, LVEF<ORGANIZATION> â‰¥ 45 % ) patients with sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB<ORGANIZATION>, apnea-hypopnea index, AHI<ORGANIZATION> > 15/h ) and prevalence of CSA<ORGANIZATION>. We included ten consecutive patients randomized for ASV<ORGANIZATION> on top of standard therapy for acute heart failure ( group 1 ) versus standard care alone ( group 2 ). ASV<ORGANIZATION> therapy significantly reduced AHI<ORGANIZATION> and CSA<ORGANIZATION>. An improvement in cardiac diastolic function was seen in group 1 compared to group 2 ( E/E ' 17.5 to 9.6, p < 0.02 vs 18.5 to 14.5, p = 0.4 ). Brain<PERSON> natriuretic peptide ( BNP<ORGANIZATION> ) markedly decreased in cases, but not in controls ( 298 to 84 pg/ml, p < 0.02 vs 280 to 120 pg/ml, p = 0.06 ). Right ventricle ( RV ) function significantly improved in group 1, differently from group 2. An acute use of ASV<ORGANIZATION> seems effective in reducing BNP<ORGANIZATION> and improving diastolic and RV<ORGANIZATION> function in acute HFpEF<ORGANIZATION> patients with SDB<ORGANIZATION> and CSA<ORGANIZATION>, compared to standard treatment.
