Half ( 48.9 % ) of the 45 participants reported bereavement overload. None of the medical students reported bereavement overload compared to 60.0 % of nurses, 75.0 % of administrative staff and 53.9 % of doctors. Nearly two-thirds ( 64.5 %, n = 29 ) stated that they suffered from compassion fatigue. The majority of participants ( 62.2 % ) used only positive coping mechanisms. The use of negative coping mechanisms correlated directly with a longer duration in the medical field. With a 49 % prevalence of bereavement overload, it is important that support systems are in place to prevent the effects of negative coping mechanisms. The desirable outcome is that health care providers, who suffer from bereavement overload, experience compassion satisfaction and become more dedicated to the patients ' well-being without expense to themselves.
