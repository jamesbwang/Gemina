 Remote<GPE> ischaemic preconditioning ( RIPC<ORGANIZATION> ) has been suggested as a means of protecting vital organs from reperfusion injury during major vascular surgery. This study was designed to determine whether RIPC<ORGANIZATION> could reduce the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction ( MI ) during open surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA<ORGANIZATION> ). Secondary aims were to see if RIPC<ORGANIZATION> could reduce 30-day mortality, multiple organ failure, acute intestinal ischaemia, acute kidney injury and ischaemic stroke. This randomized, non-blinded clinical trial was undertaken at three vascular surgery centres in Denmark<GPE>. Patients who had open surgery for ruptured AAA<ORGANIZATION> were randomized to intervention with RIPC<ORGANIZATION> or control in a 1: 1 ratio. Postoperative complications and deaths were registered, and ECG<ORGANIZATION> and blood samples were obtained daily during the hospital stay. Of 200 patients randomized, 142 ( 72 RIPC<ORGANIZATION>, 70 controls ) were included. There was no difference in rates of perioperative MI between the RIPC<ORGANIZATION> and control groups ( 36 versus 43 per cent respectively ), or in rates of organ failure. However, in the per-protocol analysis 30-day mortality was significantly reduced in the RIPC<ORGANIZATION> group ( odds ratio 0路46, 95 per cent c.i. 0路22 to 0路99 ; P<PERSON> = 0路048 ). RIPC<ORGANIZATION> did not reduce the incidence of perioperative MI in patients undergoing open surgery for ruptured AAA<ORGANIZATION>.
