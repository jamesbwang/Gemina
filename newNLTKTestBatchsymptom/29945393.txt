 To investigate the protective effect of Yiqi Huoxue<PERSON> decoction on the kidney in diabetic goto-Kaizaki ( GK ) rats. Eight Wistar<PERSON> rats were used as normal control group. According to body weight and blood glucose, 16 GK rats were randomly divided into model control group and Yiqi Huoxue<PERSON> group, with 8 rats in each group. Drugs were administrated for 6 weeks. The rats were weighed and fasting blood glucose ( FBG<ORGANIZATION> ) were measured weekly ; the glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbALc<ORGANIZATION> ) and 24 h metabolic rate were measured at the end of third and sixth weeks, at the same time, urine was collected to measure urinary glucose ( U-GLU ), urinary creatinine ( U-CREA ) and total proteinuria ( U-TP ) by biochemical method and calculate 24 h protein excretion rate ( UAER<ORGANIZATION> ). At the end of treatment, rats were sacrificed in anesthesia, and creatinin ( CREA<ORGANIZATION> ), uric acid ( UA ) and cholesterol ( CHOL<ORGANIZATION> ) were detected by biochemical method and glutathione peroxidase ( GSH-Px ) was detected by manual method with the blood drawn from heart. Both kidneys were taken and weighed to calculate the renal hypertrophy index. The kidneys were placed into neutral formalin and observed under light microscope for pathological change after Periodic Acid-Schiff<PERSON> ( PAS<ORGANIZATION> ) staining. The results showed that as compared with the normal control group, FBG<ORGANIZATION>, HbALc<ORGANIZATION>, 24 h Metabolic<ORGANIZATION> rate, U-GLU, UAER<ORGANIZATION>, serum CREA<ORGANIZATION>, UA<ORGANIZATION> and CHOL<ORGANIZATION> levels, as well as renal hypertrophy index were significantly increased (
