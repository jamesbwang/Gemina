 Demoralization syndrome is a significant condition that has not been greatly studied in Southern<GPE> European<GPE> countries. To extend the knowledge of demoralization in Southern Europe<LOCATION> by examining its prevalence according to different methods of assessment, its relationship with anxiety and depression, and its impact on quality of life among cancer patients. A convenience sample of 195 cancer outpatients from two oncology centers ( 102 from Lisbon<GPE>, Portugal<GPE> and 93 from Ferrara<GPE>, Italy<GPE> ) participated in an observational, cross-sectional study using the Diagnostic Criteria<ORGANIZATION> of Psychosomatic<ORGANIZATION> Research-Demoralization interview ( DCPR/D ) and psychometric tools ( Demoralization<ORGANIZATION> scale-DS ; Patient Health<PERSON> Questionnaire-9/PHQ-9 ; Hospital Anxiety Depression<ORGANIZATION> Scale-HADS ; and European<GPE> Quality of Life-5-EQ-5D ). A 25.1 % prevalence ( CI<ORGANIZATION> 95 % 0.19-0.31 ) of clinically-relevant demoralization was reported on the DCPR/D interview. A DS-Total cut-off score â‰¥25 maximized sensitivity ( 81.6 % ), and specificity ( 72.6 % ) in identifying DCPR/D demoralized patients. DCPR/D and DS were associated with poorer levels of QoL<ORGANIZATION>. About half of the patients who were demoralized were not clinically depressed ( PHQ-9 ). Self-reported suicidal ideation ( PHQ-9 item 9 ) was found in a minority of patients ( 8.2 % ), most of whom ( 77 % ) were cases of depression ( PHQ-9 ), but one-quarter ( 23 % ) were not depressed, yet moderately/severely demoralized ( DCPR/D and DS ). This Southern European<LOCATION> study confirms the importance of demoralization in cancer patients as a different condition with respect to depression, and its relationship with poor QoL<ORGANIZATION> and suicidal ideation.
