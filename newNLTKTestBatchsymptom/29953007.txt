 To identify magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) features in the prediction of tumor aggressiveness in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC<ORGANIZATION> ) .In this prospective study, 105 patients with 122 PTCs<ORGANIZATION> underwent MRI<ORGANIZATION> with T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced sequences prior to thyroidectomy. Based on exclusion criteria, 62 patients with 62 PTCs were finally suitable for further analysis. Tumor<PERSON> aggressiveness was defined according to the surgical histopathology. Tumor<PERSON> size, apparent diffusion coefficients ( ADC<ORGANIZATION> ) value and MRI<ORGANIZATION> features on images were obtained for each patient. Descriptive statistics for tumor aggressiveness, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of individual features were determined. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to identify features that were independently predictive for tumor aggressiveness. Analyses of receiver-operating characteristic ( ROC<ORGANIZATION> ) curve were performed.High aggressive PTC<ORGANIZATION> significantly differed from low aggressive PTC in size ( P<PERSON> = .016 ), size classification ( P<PERSON> < .001 ), ADC<ORGANIZATION> value ( P<PERSON> = .01 ), angulation on the lateral surface of the lesion ( P<PERSON> = .009 ), signal intensity heterogeneity on ADC<ORGANIZATION> maps ( P<PERSON> = .003 ), early enhancement degree ( P<PERSON> < .001 ), tumor margin on delayed contrast-enhanced images ( P<PERSON> < .001 ), and inner lining of delayed ring enhancement ( P<PERSON> = .028 ). The interobserver agreement between the 2 readers was satisfactory with Cohen<PERSON> k ranging from 0.83 to 1.00 ( P<PERSON> < .001 ). Logistic regression model showed lesion size classification and tumor margin on delayed contrast-enhanced images as strongest independent predictors of high aggressive PTC<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> = .009 and P<PERSON> = .047 ), with an accuracy of 83.9 %. The area under ROC<ORGANIZATION> curve for ADC<ORGANIZATION> value and lesion size were 0.68 and 0.81, respectively.These findings suggest that MRI<ORGANIZATION> before surgery has the potential to discriminate tumor aggressiveness in patients with PTC<ORGANIZATION>.
