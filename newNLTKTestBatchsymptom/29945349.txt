 Peripheral blood absolute monocyte count ( AMC<ORGANIZATION> ) and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio ( LMR<ORGANIZATION> ) have strong prognostic value in various forms of lymphomas. It was found that higher AMC<ORGANIZATION> and lower LMR were associated with poor prognosis in B<GPE> cell lymphoma. However, their prognostic significance in systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( sALCL<ORGANIZATION> ) remained to be determined. This study was aimed at investigating the prognostic significance of AMC<ORGANIZATION> and LMR<ORGANIZATION> in sALCL<GPE>. A total of 29 newly diagnosed patients with sALCL<ORGANIZATION> were retrospectively included in study, prognostic significance of AMC<ORGANIZATION>, LMR<ORGANIZATION>, performance status ( PS ), international prognostic index ( IPI<ORGANIZATION> ), prognostic index for T-cell lymphomas ( PIT<ORGANIZATION> ) and other indicators were analyzed. Univariate<ORGANIZATION> analysis showed high AMC<ORGANIZATION>, LMR<ORGANIZATION> < 2.5, PS<ORGANIZATION> ⩾ 2, extranodal involvement, no response to treatment and B symptoms predicted inferior PFS<ORGANIZATION> ; LMR<ORGANIZATION> < 2.5, no response to treatment, elevated LDH<ORGANIZATION>, IPI<ORGANIZATION> ⩾ 3, PIT<ORGANIZATION> ⩾ 2 and PS<ORGANIZATION> ⩾ 2 predicted inferior OS. High AMC<PERSON>, PS<ORGANIZATION> ⩾ 2 were independent prognostic factors for PFS<ORGANIZATION> ; PS<ORGANIZATION> ⩾ 2, no response to treatment and elevated LDH<ORGANIZATION> were independent prognostic factors for OS<ORGANIZATION>. AMC<ORGANIZATION> was an independent prognostic factor for PFS<ORGANIZATION> in sALCL<GPE>, and LMR<ORGANIZATION> < 2.5 also indicated poor prognosis.
