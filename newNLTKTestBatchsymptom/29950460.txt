 There is an epidemic of opioid use related to adverse events and deaths in the USA<ORGANIZATION>. The rates of chronic pain, mental illness and substance use disorder are higher at the Veterans Health Administration<ORGANIZATION> ( VHA<ORGANIZATION> ) compared with the general US<GSP> population. The 2016 Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act<PERSON> requires the VHA<ORGANIZATION> to improve opioid therapy strategies in treating patients and to ensure responsible prescribing practices. The Stratification Tool<ORGANIZATION> for Opioid Risk Mitigation<PERSON> ( STORM ) is a web-based dashboard that prioritises review of VHA<ORGANIZATION> patients receiving opioids based on their risk. The VHA Partnered<ORGANIZATION> Evidence-based Policy Resource Center is coordinating a multiyear evaluation of STORM<ORGANIZATION> and aspects of the VHA<ORGANIZATION> policy that mandate case review of patients identified by STORM<ORGANIZATION> as very high risk. This stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial will test two hypotheses: ( 1 ) VHA<ORGANIZATION> medical centres randomised to facilitation for not meeting the targeted case review rate will achieve lower opioid-related serious adverse events ( SAEs<ORGANIZATION> ), relative to facilities not randomised to facilitation and ( 2 ) Patients whose cases are required to be reviewed will have a lower rate of opioid-related SAEs<ORGANIZATION> compared with comparable risk patients whose cases are not required to be reviewed. Patients who receive an opioid prescription at VHA<ORGANIZATION> medical centres will be followed for a minimum of 3 months after their first opioid prescription. Follow-up will continue until the last day of the project or death. The data will be analysed using an intention-to-treat approach with patient-month-level Cox proportional hazards models for both interventions. Evaluation of the randomised roll-out was approved by the VA Boston Healthcare System<ORGANIZATION> Institutional Review Board ( IRB<ORGANIZATION> ) and Research & Development Committees<ORGANIZATION> ( Protocol # 3069 ). Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national conference meetings. ISRCTN16012111.
