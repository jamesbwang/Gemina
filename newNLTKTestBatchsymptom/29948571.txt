 The cost-effectiveness of screening and surveillance for Barrett<PERSON> 's esophagus continues to evolve as the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma increases, biomarkers enhance the identification of individuals at highest risk for developing cancer, and endoscopic eradication of Barrett<PERSON> 's esophagus improves. Screening to detect Barrett<PERSON> 's esophagus may be cost-effective in selected high-risk groups based on age, race, sex and other factors such as symptoms of heartburn. Currently<PERSON>, endoscopic eradication therapy for Barrett<PERSON> 's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia is a cost-effective intervention, while endoscopic therapy for non-dysplastic Barrett<PERSON> 's esophagus is not a cost-effective strategy. As diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia improves, endoscopic eradication therapy may also prove to be a cost-effective intervention.
