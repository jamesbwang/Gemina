 To report patient-reported outcomes of patients with PsA<ORGANIZATION> treated with ixekizumab up to 52 weeks. In SPIRIT-P1, biologic-naïve patients with active PsA were randomized to ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks ( IXEQ4W<ORGANIZATION> ; N = 107 ) or every 2 weeks ( IXEQ2W<ORGANIZATION> ; N = 103 ) following a 160 mg starting dose, adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks ( ADA<ORGANIZATION> ; N = 101 ) or placebo ( PBO<ORGANIZATION> ; N = 106 ) during the initial 24-week double-blind treatment period. At week 24 ( week 16 for inadequate responders ), ADA<ORGANIZATION> ( 8-week washout before starting ixekizumab ) and PBO<ORGANIZATION> patients were re-randomized to IXEQ2W<ORGANIZATION> or IXEQ4W<ORGANIZATION>. Patients receiving ixekizumab at week 24 received the same dose during the extension period ( EP ) to week 52. Patients<PERSON> completed measures including the Dermatology Life Quality Index<ORGANIZATION> ( DLQI<ORGANIZATION> ), Itch Numeric Rating Scale<PERSON>, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2, European<GPE> Quality of Life 5 Dimensions Visual Analogue Scale and Work Productivity<PERSON> and Activity Impairment<ORGANIZATION> Questionnaire-Specific Health Problem. The IXEQ4W<ORGANIZATION>, IXEQ2W<ORGANIZATION> and ADA<ORGANIZATION> groups reported significant improvements in DLQI<ORGANIZATION> at week 24 ; 22 % ( PBO<ORGANIZATION> ), 53 % ( IXEQ4W<ORGANIZATION> ), 63 % ( IXEQ2W<ORGANIZATION> ) and 54 % ( ADA<ORGANIZATION> ) of patients reported DLQI<ORGANIZATION> scores of 0/1. The IXEQ4W<ORGANIZATION>, IXEQ2W<ORGANIZATION> and ADA<ORGANIZATION> groups reported significant improvements in Itch<GPE> Numeric Rating Scale, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 physical component summary and some domain scores, and European<GPE> Quality of Life 5 Dimensions Visual Analogue Scale at weeks 12 and 24 ; and in three of four Work Productivity and Activity Impairment<ORGANIZATION> Questionnaire-Specific Health Problem domains at week 24. Results are also presented through week 52 for the EP. In biologic-naïve patients with active PsA<ORGANIZATION>, ixekizumab significantly improved skin symptoms, health-related quality of life and work productivity.
