 OBJECTIVE To assess effects of buprenorphine hydrochloride ( BH ), sustained-release buprenorphine ( SRB<ORGANIZATION> ), and high-concentration buprenorphine ( HCB<ORGANIZATION> ) formulations in healthy rats. ANIMALS 8 Sprague-Dawley rats. PROCEDURES In a crossover-design study, rats received BH ( 0.05 mg/kg ), SRB<ORGANIZATION> ( 1.2 mg/kg ), HCB<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.30 mg/kg ), or 5 % dextrose solution ( 0.2 mL/kg ), SC<ORGANIZATION>, once. Self-injurious behavior and thermal sensitivity ( hind limb withdrawal latencies ) were assessed prior to injection ( time 0 ) and 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after injection. Food<PERSON> intake, kaolin intake, and fecal output were measured over 12-hour light and dark periods before and after each treatment. Values<PERSON> were compared among treatments and time points. RESULTS Self-injurious behavior was detected with all buprenorphine treatments ; scores were greater at all time points during the 12 hours after HCB<ORGANIZATION> and 24 hours after SRB<ORGANIZATION> administration than at time 0. Percentage change in hind limb withdrawal latencies from time 0 was higher with BH<ORGANIZATION> and HCB<ORGANIZATION> 1 hour after injection than at other time points. Postinjection light-period food intake was higher ( BH<ORGANIZATION> and HCB<ORGANIZATION> ) and dark-period food intake was lower ( BH<ORGANIZATION>, HCB<ORGANIZATION>, and SRB<ORGANIZATION> ), compared with preinjection values for the same treatments. For SRB<ORGANIZATION>, postinjection light-period kaolin intake was greater than the preinjection value, and postinjection light- and dark-period kaolin intake was greater than that for other treatments. CONCLUSIONS<ORGANIZATION> AND CLINICAL<ORGANIZATION> RELEVANCE Hypoalgesic effects were briefly observed after administration of BH or HCB<ORGANIZATION> in healthy rats ; adverse effects were detected in some rats with all buprenorphine formulations. Studies comparing effects of BH<ORGANIZATION>, SRB<ORGANIZATION>, and HCB<ORGANIZATION> in rats undergoing surgery or other noxious stimuli are indicated to determine clinical benefits in this species.
