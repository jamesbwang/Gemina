 Diabetic<GPE> macular edema ( DME<ORGANIZATION> ) is one of the major causes of blindness, caused primarily by hyperglycemia and results from multiple pathological processes mostly secondary to increased levels of VEGF<ORGANIZATION> and other inflammatory cytokines. DME<ORGANIZATION> management includes control of systemic risk factors together with laser photocoagulation, frequent intraocular injections of anti-VEGF agents and steroids implants. Recent adoption of novel alternative drug delivery options has led to the development of sustained release ocular implants with longer duration of action with less injection frequency. This article will review the pharmacology and clinical data in terms of efficacy, safety and benefits of the sustained release steroid implants in treatment of DME<ORGANIZATION> with special emphasis on the fluocinolone acetonide ILUVIEN<ORGANIZATION>
