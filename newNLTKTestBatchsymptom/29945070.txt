 Vascular<GPE> dementia ( VaD<ORGANIZATION> ) is characteristic of chronic brain ischemia and progressive memory decline, which has a high incidence in the elderly. However, there are no effective treatments for VaD<ORGANIZATION>, and the underlying mechanism of its pathogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 ( WIN<ORGANIZATION> ) on VaD<ORGANIZATION>, and molecular mechanisms of the effects. VaD<ORGANIZATION> model was induced by 2-vessel occlusion ( 2VO ). Spatial reference learning was evaluated by the Morris<GPE> water maze, and recognition memory was assessed using the novel object recognition test. Autophagy-related proteins [ microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( LC-3 ) and Beclin-1 ] were examined by immunohistochemistry and Western<GPE> blot. Caspase-3 was detected by Western<GPE> blot. Inflammatory factors, tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) and interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β ), were estimated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and Western<GPE> blot. VaD<ORGANIZATION> increased the levels of LC-3, Beclin-1, and inflammatory factors, which were reversed by chronic treatment with WIN<ORGANIZATION>. WIN<ORGANIZATION> decreased the expression of Capase-3, and improved the learning and memory impairment of VaD<ORGANIZATION> rats. These data indicate that WIN<ORGANIZATION> exerts a neuroprotective effect on the cognitive deficits of VaD<ORGANIZATION> rats, which may be associated with the suppression of excessive autophagy and inflammation.
