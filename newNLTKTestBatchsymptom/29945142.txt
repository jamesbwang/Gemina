 Patients with malignant pleural effusion ( MPE<ORGANIZATION> ) secondary to lung cancer have been associated with poor prognosis historically. LENT score developed to risk-stratify unselected patients with MPE<ORGANIZATION> predicts prognosis of < 6 months in patients with lung cancer. To assess the performance of LENT<ORGANIZATION> score in predicting prognosis in selected population of MPE<ORGANIZATION> secondary to lung adenocarcinoma alone. A retrospective observational study was conducted by reviewing the medical records of patients managed for MPE<ORGANIZATION> in the year 2012. Seventy patients with lung adenocarcinoma presenting with MPE<ORGANIZATION> were studied. The median ( range ) LENT<ORGANIZATION> score at initial diagnosis was 5 ( 2-7 ), and the median survival 7.9 ( 0.13-40 ) months. Thirty-nine patients received epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKIs ). The median LENT<ORGANIZATION> score and median survival was 4 ( 2-7 ) and 14.4 months, respectively, in this group. Those in high-risk category by LENT<ORGANIZATION> in this group ( n = 19 ) had a median survival and 6-month survival of 17.4 months and 73.6 %, respectively. Thirty-one patients were treated with conventional chemotherapy. The median LENT<ORGANIZATION> score and median survival was 5 ( 2-7 ) and 4.1 ( 0.13-34.3 ) months, respectively, in this group. The median survival and 6-month survival rate in patients in high-risk category and moderate-risk category by LENT<ORGANIZATION> score was 6.2 months and 52.7 %, and 11.4 months and 70.5 %, respectively. LENT score underestimates prognosis in patients having MPE<ORGANIZATION> secondary to lung adenocarcinoma. This disparity particularly applies to the lung adenocarcinoma patients carrying EGFR<ORGANIZATION> mutation. Hence<PERSON>, LENT<ORGANIZATION> score may not be applicable to, or may need modification before applying to such patients.
