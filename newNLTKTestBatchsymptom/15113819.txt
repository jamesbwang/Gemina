 [ Purpose<PERSON> ] To investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on rehabilitation outcomes and balance in patients having hemiplegia due to ischemic stroke. [ Subjects and Methods<ORGANIZATION> ] Vitamin D<PERSON> levels of 132 patients hospitalized for hemiplegia rehabilitation due to ischemic stroke were tested. Consequently, 86/132 patients had low vitamin D levels, 72 of which met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A ( injected with 300,000 IU vitamin D ), and Group B<PERSON> ( injected intramuscularly with saline ). Each patient was tested at the baseline and at the third month using the Brunnstrom<ORGANIZATION> recovery staging, functional ambulation scale, modified Barthel<PERSON> index, and Berg<PERSON> balance scale. The findings were compared between the groups. [ Results ] By the end of the third month, The Berg<ORGANIZATION> balance scale results and modified Barthel<PERSON> index scores significantly differed between the two groups, whereas Brunnstrom recovery staging and functional ambulation scale test results did not. [ Conclusion ] This study found that vitamin D administration increased the activity levels and accelerated balance recovery but did not significantly affect ambulation or motor recovery. These results warrant confirmation by longer follow-up studies with a larger number of participants.
