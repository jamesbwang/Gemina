 This study evaluates the impact of a 3-week period of intensive pelvic floor muscles training ( PFMT<ORGANIZATION> ), with or without instrumentation, on clinical and static magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) changes of puborectalis ( PR ) and iliococcygeus ( IL ) muscles. 24 healthy young women were enrolled in the study and 17 achieved the 9 sessions of 30 min training exercises and conducted all assessments. Participants were randomly assigned in two training groups: voluntary contractions combined with hypopressive exercises ( HYPO<ORGANIZATION> ) or biofeedback exercises combined with transvaginal electrical stimulations ( ELEC<ORGANIZATION> ). Clinical<PERSON> and T2-weighted MRI<ORGANIZATION> assessments were realized before and after training. Modified Oxford Grading System<PERSON> ( MOGS<ORGANIZATION> ) scores for left PR<ORGANIZATION> and perineal body significantly increased in the two groups ( p = 0.039, p = 0.008 ), but MOGS<ORGANIZATION> score for right PR significantly increased only in HYPO<GPE> ( p = 0.020 ). Muscle<PERSON> volumes of right and left IL significantly decreased ( p = 0.040, p = 0.045 ) after training as well as signal intensities of right and left PR ( p = 0.040, p = 0.021 ) and thickness of right and left IL at mid-vagina<GPE> location ( p = 0.012, p = 0.011 ). A short period of intensive PFMT<ORGANIZATION> induces clinical and morphological changes in PFMs<ORGANIZATION> at rest suggesting a decrease in IL<GPE> volume and adipose content of PR<ORGANIZATION>. Although the results suggested that an intensive non-instrumented PFMT<ORGANIZATION> is as effective as an instrumented training, future controlled studies with greater sample sizes are needed to establish the relative and absolute effectiveness of each of the two interventions.
