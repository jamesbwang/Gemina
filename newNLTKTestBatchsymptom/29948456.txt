 Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC<ORGANIZATION> ) is the most frequent oral malignant neoplasia. As consequence of OSCC<ORGANIZATION> treatment, oral mucositis ( OM ) is one of the most common adverse effects of OSCC<ORGANIZATION> treatment. Currently, there is no consensus for OM<ORGANIZATION> treatment. The purpose of the current study was to test the combination of red and infrared low-level laser therapy ( LLLT<ORGANIZATION> ) for OM<ORGANIZATION> treatment. Primary culture of human fibroblast was performed to identify LLLT<ORGANIZATION> dose. After laboratory tests, a two-arm parallel, single-blind, controlled study was conducted. The two arms were group 1, both 660- and 808-nm wavelengths ( 300 J/cm
