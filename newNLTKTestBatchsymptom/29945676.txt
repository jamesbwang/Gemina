 Dengue<GPE> virus infection in humans can lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild fever to potentially fatal dengue shock syndrome. The incidence of dengue fever is on the rise in tropical countries. Due<PERSON> to the increasing incidence of dengue fever worldwide, atypical manifestations of the disease are increasingly reported. In this article we report a patient with dengue haemorrhagic fever who presented with reversible splenial lesion syndrome. A 24-year-old Sri Lankan man who presented with fever and confusion was eventually diagnosed to have reversible splenial lesion syndrome based on brain imaging. Clinical<PERSON>, serological and haematological parameters confirmed a diagnosis of dengue haemorrhagic fever. His presentation, assessment, and management are described in this case report. Reversible splenial lesion syndrome is a condition which is radiologically characterized by reversible lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. It is associated with infectious and non-infectious aetiologies. This case report highlights the occurrence of reversible splenial lesion syndrome as a presenting feature of the expanding list of unusual neurological manifestations of dengue infection.
