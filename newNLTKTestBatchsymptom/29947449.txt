 Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura ( HSP<ORGANIZATION> ) is a common form of vasculitis in children. It typically involves small vessels of the skin, the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract, joints, and kidneys. GI involvement is the most severe short-term complication and GI<ORGANIZATION> bleeding is a major complication of HSP<ORGANIZATION>. However, there is no established predictive marker of GI bleeding. Blood<PERSON> neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR<ORGANIZATION> ) has been proposed as a potentially useful marker of clinical outcome in diseases with an inflammatory component. We aimed to determine the association of NLR<ORGANIZATION> with HSP<ORGANIZATION> and investigate the usefulness of NLR<ORGANIZATION> as a marker to predict GI bleeding in children with HSP<ORGANIZATION>. All patients newly diagnosed as having HSP<ORGANIZATION> were reviewed retrospectively. White<PERSON> blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet counts, mean platelet volume, neutrophil and lymphocyte count were evaluated. NLR<ORGANIZATION> and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR<ORGANIZATION> ) were calculated using the results from complete blood count tests. This study included of 141 HSP patients. GI involvement was found in 65 patients ( 46.1 % ) ; of them, 15 patients ( 10.6 % ) had GI<ORGANIZATION> bleeding. The NLR<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> = 0.001 ) and PLR<ORGANIZATION> ( P<PERSON> = 0.032 ) at the time of diagnosis was significantly patients with GI bleeding than in those without GI<ORGANIZATION> bleeding. Logistic regression analysis showed that NLR<ORGANIZATION> was the only independent predictor of GI<ORGANIZATION> bleeding ( P<PERSON> = 0.004 ). The optimal cutoff value of NLR<ORGANIZATION> for predicting GI bleeding was 2.86 ( sensitivity, 73 % ; specificity, 68 % ). NLR<ORGANIZATION>, a simple and easily obtainable parameter, is a potential predictive marker of GI bleeding in children with HSP<ORGANIZATION>. This article is protected by copyright.
