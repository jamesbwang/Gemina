 Low molecular weight heparins ( LMWHs<ORGANIZATION> ) are considered the standard of care for the treatment of venous thromboembolism ( VTE<ORGANIZATION> ) associated with cancer. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants ( DOACs<ORGANIZATION> ) in patients with cancer. We systematically searched Medline<PERSON> for potential randomized-control clinical trials ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ) and post-hoc analyses. For each study, data on recurrent VTE<ORGANIZATION>, major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding ( CRNMB<ORGANIZATION> ), and major bleeding ( MB ) were extracted. Initially, a total of 1395 citations were identified. Eight studies met our eligibility criteria. The utilization of DOACs<ORGANIZATION> in patients with cancer showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of VTE<ORGANIZATION> recurrence compared to LMWH<ORGANIZATION> or warfarin ( RR<ORGANIZATION> = 0.64 ; 95 % CI 0.46-0.88 ). Similar rates of major or CRNMB<ORGANIZATION> were observed between DOACs<ORGANIZATION> and LMWH<ORGANIZATION> or warfarin ( RR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.00 ; 95 % CI 0.75-1.33 ). There was no significant difference in the rate of MB<ORGANIZATION> between DOACs<ORGANIZATION> and LMWH<ORGANIZATION> or warfarin ( RR<ORGANIZATION> = 1.31 ; 95 % CI 0.71-2.44 ). Our results suggest that DOACs<ORGANIZATION> might reduce the incidence of VTE<ORGANIZATION> recurrence in patients with cancer without putting them at high risk for MB/CRNMB or MB. Our findings were mainly driven by the results of the Hokusai<ORGANIZATION> VTE Cancer trial. Given the level of investigated evidence, our findings should be interpreted with caution since the majority of the data were originated from sub-group analyses of large ( RCTs<ORGANIZATION> ). Future studies that are adequately powered are warranted to assess efficacy and safety data of DOACs<ORGANIZATION> for the treatment of VTE<ORGANIZATION> in patients with different types of cancer. The abstract should be followed by 3-4 bullet points highlighting the major findings.
