 To evaluate health-related quality of life in asthma patients treated at a referral center in southern Brazil<PERSON>, identifying differences between male and female patients, as well as to evaluate differences between the males and females in terms of asthma control, lung function, and nutritional status. This was a cross-sectional study involving patients ≥ 18 years of age treated at an asthma outpatient clinic. We evaluated clinical parameters, lung function, nutritional status, and quality of life. A total of 198 patients completed the study. The mean age was 56.2 ± 14.8 years, and 81.8 % were female. The proportion of patients with uncontrolled asthma was higher among females than among males ( 63.0 % vs. 44.4 % ; p = 0.041 ). The body mass index ( BMI<ORGANIZATION> ) and percentage of body fat were higher in females than in males ( 30.2 ± 5.8 kg/m2 vs. 26.9 ± 4.5 kg/m2 and 37.4 ± 6.4 % vs. 26.5 ± 7.4 % ; p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively ). Quality of life was lower in females than in males in the following domains: symptoms ( 3.8 ± 1.5 vs. 4.6 ± 1.7 ; p = 0.006 ) ; activity limitation ( 3.6 ± 1.3 vs. 4.4 ± 1.5 ; p = 0.001 ) ; emotional function ( 3.6 ± 1.9 vs. 4.5 ± 1.7 ; p = 0.014 ) ; and environmental stimuli ( 3.2 ± 1.6 vs. 4.3 ± 1.9 ; p = 0.001 ). Male<PERSON> asthma patients appear to fare better than do female asthma patients in terms of health-related quality of life, asthma control, BMI<ORGANIZATION>, percentage of body fat, and comorbidities.
