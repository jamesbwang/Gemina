 The purpose of this study was to compare the satisfaction of patients regarding retention, stability and accumulation of particles with a randomized, double-blind crossed method in users with complete dentures with and without adhesive. Seventeen edentulous individuals were randomized and received new upper and lower complete dentures. After a period of adaptation, they participated in some masticatory tests and clinical revisions, after use the protheses with and without the use of two denture adhesives: Adhesive A ( Fittydent<ORGANIZATION>, Fittydent International<ORGANIZATION> GmbH ) and adhesive B ( Corega<ORGANIZATION>, GlaxoSmithKline<ORGANIZATION> ) at 0, 7 and 14 days. Satisfaction was measured immediately after each test through a survey using a VAS<ORGANIZATION> scale ( 0-10 ) and data were analyzed with McNemar<ORGANIZATION> 's test with Bonferroni<PERSON> correction. The results showed significant differences ( Complete<ORGANIZATION> denture adhesives significantly improved the satisfaction of patients because a better retention, stability and less accumulation of particles of the food substitute between the denture and the mucosa is obtained compared with non-use of complete denture adhesives.
