 To compare the pharmaco-economic effect of 3 chemotherapeutic regimens in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ). One hundred and thirty-eight newly diagnosed cases of MM in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively, and then MM patients were divided into group A, B and C group according to therapeutic regimen. Group A<PERSON> was treated with VCD<ORGANIZATION> therapeutic regimen ( bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone, 63 cases ), The patients in group B was treated with BiCTD<ORGANIZATION> therapeutic regimen ( clarithromycin+cyclophosphamide+thalidomide+dexamethasone, 44 cases ), The patients in group C was treated with CTD<ORGANIZATION> therapeutic regimen ( cyclophosphamide+ thalidomide+dexamethasone, 33 cases ). The clinical efficacy, adverse reaction, cost-effectiveness were observed and analysed after 4 courses of treatment among 3 groups. The overall response rates of group A, B and C were 96.83 %, 81.82 % and 64.52 % with statistical significant difference ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). The high efficiency response rates of 3 groups were 82.5 %, 59.09 %, 32.26 % with very significant statistical difference ( P<PERSON> < 0.01 ). The infection rate of group A was statistically and significantly higher than other 2 groups ( P=0.048 ), and the constipation rate in group A was statistically and significantly higer than that in group B and C ( P<PERSON> < 0.05 ). The cost-effectiveness ratios of 3 groups were 69567.44, 20765.12 and 21475.48, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of group A and B were 183933.21 and 22259.09, as compared with group C. The result was in accordance with sensitivity test. Clinicial<PERSON> efficacy of group A is the best, but group B has advantages on cost-effectiveness ratio as compared with other groups, otherwise, group B has low incidence of adverse reaction. In the view of safety, therapeutic efficacy and pharmacoeconomics for treatment of patients with MM<ORGANIZATION>, the BiCTD<ORGANIZATION> regimen has been confirmed to be superior to the other 2 groups.
