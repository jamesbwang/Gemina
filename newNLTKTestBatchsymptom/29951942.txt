 Hypothermia<GPE> is currently the only approved therapy for global cerebral ischemia ( GCI<ORGANIZATION> ) after cardiac arrest ; however, it unfortunately has multiple adverse effects. As a noninvasive procedure, photobiomodulation ( PBM<ORGANIZATION> ) therapy has emerged as a potential novel treatment for brain injury. PBM<ORGANIZATION> involves the use of low-level laser light therapy to influence cell behavior. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of PBM<ORGANIZATION> treatment with an 808-nm diode laser initiated 6 h after GCI<ORGANIZATION>. It was noted that PBM<ORGANIZATION> dose-dependently protected against GCI-induced neuronal death in the vulnerable hippocampal CA1<ORGANIZATION> subregion. Functional assessments demonstrated that PBM<ORGANIZATION> markedly preserved both short-term ( a week ) and long-term ( 6 months ) spatial learning and memory function following GCI<ORGANIZATION>. Further<PERSON> mechanistic studies revealed that PBM<ORGANIZATION> post-treatment ( a ) preserved healthy mitochondrial dynamics and suppressed substantial mitochondrial fragmentation of CA1<ORGANIZATION> neurons, by reducing the detrimental Drp1 GTPase<PERSON> activity and its interactions with adaptor proteins Mff<PERSON> and Fis1<PERSON> and by balancing mitochondrial targeting fission and fusion protein levels ; ( b ) reduced mitochondrial oxidative damage and excessive mitophagy and restored mitochondrial overall health status and preserved mitochondrial function ; and ( c ) suppressed mitochondria-dependent apoptosome formation/caspase-3/9 apoptosis-processing activities. Additionally, we validated, in an in vitro ischemia model, that cytochrome c oxidase served as a key PBM<ORGANIZATION> target for mitochondrial function preservation and neuroprotection. Our findings suggest that PBM<ORGANIZATION> serves as a promising therapeutic strategy for the functional recovery after GCI<ORGANIZATION>, with mechanisms involving PBM<ORGANIZATION> 's preservation on mitochondrial dynamics and functions and the inhibition of delayed apoptotic neuronal death in GCI<ORGANIZATION>.
