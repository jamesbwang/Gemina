 Anterior<GPE> temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis is a very effective measure to control seizures, and the probability of being seizure-free is approximately 70-90 %. However, 30 % of patients still experience seizures after surgery. An Aura is a subjective ictal phenomenon that may precede an observable seizure. Nevertheless, few are the studies associating the prognostic factor with aura, although, being the initial symptoms of epileptic seizures, many types of auras have significant localizing or lateralizing value. This study hypothesized that the type of preoperative aura may predict the postsurgical outcome in patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy due to mesial temporal sclerosis. Of 1214 patients evaluated for surgery in the epilepsy Center<ORGANIZATION> of Faculdade<GPE> de Medicina<GPE> de SÃ£o Jose<PERSON> do Rio Preto<PERSON> ( FAMERP<ORGANIZATION> ), a tertiary Brazilian<GPE> epilepsy center, 400 underwent ATL<ORGANIZATION> for MTS<ORGANIZATION>. Number and type of auras was analyzed and compared with Engel<PERSON> classification for outcome. Analyzing the patients by the type of aura, those who had extratemporal auras had worst result in post-surgical in Engel<GPE> classifcation. While mesial auras apparently is a good prognostic factor. Patients without aura also had worse prognosis. Simple<PERSON> and multiple aura had no difference. In order to identify the most appropriate candidates for ATL<ORGANIZATION>, is very important to consider the prognostic factors associated with favorable for counseling patients in daily practice.
