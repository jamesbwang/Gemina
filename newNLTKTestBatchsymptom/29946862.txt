 As local therapies improve, contralateral breast cancer ( CBC<ORGANIZATION> ) risk for women with ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS<ORGANIZATION> ) may exceed the risk of a second ipsilateral breast cancer. We sought to determine whether estrogen-receptor ( ER ) status influenced CBC<ORGANIZATION> risk. We identified women aged 40-79 with DCIS<ORGANIZATION> diagnosed between 1990 and 2002 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology<GPE>, and End Results<PERSON> database. We used multivariable competing risk regression to examine predictors of time from index DCIS<ORGANIZATION> to CBC<ORGANIZATION> ( invasive or in situ ). Multivariable competing risk regression found ER status to be a highly significant predictor of CBC<ORGANIZATION>. The 10-year cumulative incidence was estimated to be 5.3 % ( 95 % CI 4.8-5.8 % ) among ER positive ( ER+ ) cases and 3.3 % ( 95 % CI 2.6-4.0 % ) among ER negative ( ER- ). This finding suggests that ER+ DCIS may represent a field effect that confers increased propensity for developing cancer across breast tissue, regardless of laterality. In contrast, ER- DCIS may represent an isolated local event. Given that the majority of DCIS<ORGANIZATION> is ER+, and only a minority of DCIS<ORGANIZATION> patients receive hormonal therapy, consideration of ER<ORGANIZATION> status may influence treatment and surveillance approaches.
