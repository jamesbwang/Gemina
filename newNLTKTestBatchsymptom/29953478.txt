 Aim<PERSON> was to develop a full automatic clustering approach of the time-activity curves ( TAC<ORGANIZATION> ) from dynamic 18F-FET PET<ORGANIZATION> and evaluate its association with IDH1<ORGANIZATION> mutation status and survival in patients with gliomas. Thirty-seven patients ( mean age: 45Â±13 y ) with newly diagnosed gliomas and dynamic 18F-FET PET<ORGANIZATION> before any histopathologic investigation or treatment were retrospectively included. Each dynamic 18F-FET PET<ORGANIZATION> was realigned to the first image and spatially normalized in the Montreal Neurological Institute<ORGANIZATION> template. A tumor mask was semi-automatically generated from Z-score maps. Each brain tumor voxel was clustered in one of the 3 following centroids using dynamic time warping and k-means clustering ( centroid # 1: slowly increasing slope ; centroid # 2: rapidly increasing followed by slowly decreasing slope ; and centroid # 3: rapidly increasing followed by rapidly decreasing slope ). The percentage of each dynamic 18F-FET TAC<ORGANIZATION> within tumors and other conventional 18F-FET PET<ORGANIZATION> parameters ( maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios [ TBRmax<ORGANIZATION> and TBRmean<ORGANIZATION> ], time-to-peak [ TTP ] and slope ) was compared between wild-type and IDH1<ORGANIZATION> mutant tumors. Their prognostic value was assessed in terms of progression free-survival ( PFS<ORGANIZATION> ) and overall survival ( OS ) by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Twenty patients were IDH1<ORGANIZATION> wild-type and 17 IDH1<ORGANIZATION> mutant. Higher percentage of centroid # 1 and centroid # 3 within tumors were positively ( P<PERSON> = 0.016 ) and negatively ( P<PERSON> = 0.01 ) correlated with IDH1<ORGANIZATION> mutated status. Also, TBRmax<ORGANIZATION>, TBRmean<ORGANIZATION>, TTP<ORGANIZATION>, and slope discriminated significantly between tumors with and without IDH1<ORGANIZATION> mutation ( P range 0.01 to 0.04 ). Progression occurred in 22 patients ( 59 % ) at a median of 13.1 months ( 7.6-37.6 months ) and 13 patients ( 35 % ) died from tumor progression. Patients with a percentage of centroid # 1 > 90 % had a longer survival compared with those with a percentage of centroid # 1 < 90 % ( P = 0.003 for PFS<ORGANIZATION> and P<PERSON> = 0.028 for OS ). This remained significant after stratification on IDH1<ORGANIZATION> mutation status ( P = 0.029 for PFS<ORGANIZATION> and P<PERSON> = 0.034 for OS ). Compared to other conventional 18F-FET PET<ORGANIZATION> parameters, TTP<ORGANIZATION> and slope were associated with PFS<ORGANIZATION> and OS<ORGANIZATION> ( P range 0.009 to 0.04 ). Based on dynamic 18F-FET PET<ORGANIZATION> acquisition, we developed a full automatic clustering approach of TAC<ORGANIZATION> which appears to be a valuable noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with gliomas.
