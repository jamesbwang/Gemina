 Over activation of the endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) system in disease states contributes to endothelial dysfunction. On the other hand, ET-1 promotes proliferation and survival of endothelial cells. Regulation of programmed cell death ( PCD<ORGANIZATION> ) pathways is critical for cell survival. Recently discovered necroptosis ( regulated necrosis ) is a pathological PCD<ORGANIZATION> mechanism mediated by the activation of toll like receptor 4 ( TLR4<ORGANIZATION> ), which also happens to stimulate ET-1 production in dendritic cells. To establish the effect of ET-1 on PCD<ORGANIZATION> and survival of human brain microvascular endothelial cells ( BMVECs<ORGANIZATION> ) under control and inflammatory conditions, BMVECs<ORGANIZATION> were treated with ET-1 ( 10 nM, 100 nM and 1 microM ) or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS<ORGANIZATION>, 100 ng/ml ). ET receptors were blocked with bosentan ( 10 microM ). Under normal growth conditions, exogenous ET-1 reduced BMVEC<ORGANIZATION> viability and migration at a relatively high concentration ( 1 microM ). This was accompanied with activation of necroptosis and apoptosis marker genes. LPS<ORGANIZATION> decreased endogenous ET-1 secretion, increased ET ( B ) receptor expression and activated necroptosis. Even though ET-1 levels were low ( less than 10 nM levels used under normal growth conditions ), blocking of ET<ORGANIZATION> receptors with bosentan inhibited the necroptosis pathway and improved the cell migration ability of BMVECs<ORGANIZATION>, suggesting that under inflammatory conditions, ET-1 activates PCD<ORGANIZATION> pathways in BMVECs<GPE> even at physiological levels.
