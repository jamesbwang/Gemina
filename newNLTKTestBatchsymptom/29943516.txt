 Telomere<GPE> length is a surrogate marker of biological aging. Whether telomere length predicts the risk of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) independently of biological aging is controversial. We conducted a cohort study to examine the relationship between telomere length and paroxysmal AF ( PAF<ORGANIZATION> ), followed by a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature, incorporating our own data. DNA<ORGANIZATION> was extracted from peripheral blood. Leucocyte<PERSON> telomere length was measured by a real-time polymerase chain reaction-based method, normalized to a single copy gene, and presented as telomere/single gene ratio ( t/s ). A total of 100 non-AF patients and 50 PAF patients ( mean age: 61.0 ± 9.4 and 64.0 ± 10.7 years, respectively ) were included. T/s for subjects without AF<ORGANIZATION> tended to be shorter than for those with AF<ORGANIZATION> ( 0.21 [ 0.06-0.36 ] vs 0.28 [ 0.11-0.71 ], P<PERSON> = .077 ). T/s was associated with a 1.60-fold increase in the risk of AF but this was not significant ( 95 % CI: 0.988-2.597, P<PERSON> = .056 ). Our meta-analysis confirms no difference in telomere length between AF<ORGANIZATION> and non-AF patients and t/s was not associated with higher risk of AF in multivariate analysis. Our prospective data showed that leucocyte telomere length was similar between AF<ORGANIZATION> and non-AF patients but was significantly longer in male patients with PAF<ORGANIZATION> than those without AF in our subgroup analysis. Our meta-analysis found that t/s did not predict AF. These findings support the notion that chronological aging, but not markers of biological aging, predicts the risk of AF<ORGANIZATION>.
