 There are few cases in the literature reporting dysphagia caused by oesophageal compression by the aorta due to acute or chronic aortic pathology. This type of dysphagia is called dysphagia aortica. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is nowadays the treatment of choice for anatomically suitable patients experiencing complicated Type B<PERSON> aortic dissection. Oesophageal necrosis is a rare but fatal complication following thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Extrinsic oesophageal compression by the thrombosed aneurysmal sac, a mediastinal haematoma or extensive thrombosis in the false lumen of a dissected aorta and acute vascular occlusion of the oesophageal supply are possible mechanisms. When oesophageal necrosis is suspected, endoscopic examination and computed tomography imaging should be performed repeatedly. Oesophagoscopy<PERSON> will confirm the diagnosis revealing a black, diffusely necrotic and ulcerated oesophageal mucosa. It is critical to intervene before full-thickness oesophageal wall necrosis and mediastinitis occur. Guidelines are absent because of the rarity of this complication. Moreover, lack of a large series does not permit the establishment of guidelines either. However, oesophagectomy of the impaired oesophagus is the only chance for survival. Unfortunately, survival rates are disappointing. Prevention and awareness is the cornerstone of success. Early endoscopic examination when oesophageal necrosis is suspected due to even minimal symptoms will detect this fatal menace on time.
