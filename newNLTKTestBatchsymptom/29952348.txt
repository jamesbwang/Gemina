 Sudden<GPE> infant death syndrome mainly occurs during night-time sleep. Approximately 10 % of cases are thought to involve infants with long QT syndrome ( LQTS<ORGANIZATION> ). Autonomic<PERSON> function and QT<ORGANIZATION> interval in night-time sleep in early infancy in LQTS<ORGANIZATION> infants, however, remain controversial.Methods and Results: Holter electrocardiography was performed in 11 LQTS<ORGANIZATION> infants before medication in early infancy, and in 11 age-matched control infants. Control infants were re-evaluated in late infancy. The power spectral density was calculated and parasympathetic activity and sympathovagal balance were obtained. Electrocardiograms of a representative hour during night-time sleep, daytime sleep, and daytime activity, were chosen and QT/RR intervals were manually measured. LQTS<ORGANIZATION> infants had significantly lower parasympathetic activity and higher sympathovagal balance during night-time sleep than control infants in early infancy. These autonomic conditions in early infancy were significantly depressed compared with late infancy. Corrected QT interval ( QTc<ORGANIZATION> ) during night-time sleep ( 490±20 ms ) was significantly longer than that in daytime sleep ( 477±21 ms, P=0.04 ) or daytime activity ( 458±18 ms, P=0.003 ) in LQTS<ORGANIZATION> infants, and significantly longer than that during night-time sleep in controls. A combination of the longest QTc<ORGANIZATION> and autonomic imbalance during night-time sleep in early infancy may be responsible for development of life-threatening arrhythmia in LQTS<ORGANIZATION> infants. Critical cases should be included in future studies.
