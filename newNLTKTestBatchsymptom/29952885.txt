 The lumbar artery perforator flap is an alternative flap in breast reconstruction for those patients who are not eligible for a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator ( DIEAP<ORGANIZATION> ) flap. Shaping of this flap is easier compared with other flaps because of the quality of the lumbar fat and the gluteal extension. Between October<PERSON> of 2010 and June of 2017, a total of 100 lumbar artery perforator free flap breast reconstructions were performed in 72 patients. Patient demographics, indications, flap specifics, and complications were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-eight bilateral and 44 unilateral breast reconstructions with a lumbar artery perforator flap were performed. Mean patient age was 48 years, and the average body mass index was 23.11 kg/m. The authors report 43 preventive mastectomies for elevated cancer risk with subsequent immediate reconstruction, 34 secondary reconstructions, and 14 tertiary reconstructions. Mean operative time was 7 hours 4 minutes, including the mastectomy in primary cases. Mean<PERSON> flap weight was 499 g ( range, 77 to 1216 g ) and mean follow-up time was 30 months. The revision rate was 22 percent and nine flaps were lost. The lumbar artery perforator flap is a valuable alternative to the DIEAP<ORGANIZATION> flap in breast reconstructive surgery. It is an excellent flap for BRCA-positive patients who are typically young and have limited excess tissue at the conventional donor sites. Despite higher revision rates compared with the DIEAP<ORGANIZATION> flap, the lumbar flap is superior in mimicking the shape and feel of native breast tissue. Scarring at the donor site remains a sore point but can be easily treated and used to an advantage to contour the flanks. Therapeutic, IV<ORGANIZATION>.
