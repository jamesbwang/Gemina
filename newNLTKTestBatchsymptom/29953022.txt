 Clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion of the corpus callosum ( MERS<ORGANIZATION> ) is a recently identified clinically and radiologically distinct syndrome. Clinical<PERSON> symptoms and lesions on the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI<ORGANIZATION> ) often disappear in 1 week or a few weeks. However, MERS<ORGANIZATION> manifesting as a severe clinical course with significant sequela has not yet been reported. A 42-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of headache, fever, and irrational speech. Physical examination showed a body temperature of 39.5Â°C, dysarthria, dyscalculia, recent memory disturbance, and otherwise normal vital signs. The patient developed status epilepticus and progressive consciousness disturbance. MRI<ORGANIZATION> showed abnormal patchy signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The clinical feature and the characteristic of MRI<ORGANIZATION> are mostly consistent with MERS<ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, we made a differential diagnosis by testing the NMDARAb<ORGANIZATION>, AMPA1Ab<ORGANIZATION>, AMPA2Ab<ORGANIZATION>, LG1Ab<ORGANIZATION>, CASPR2Ab<ORGANIZATION>, GABABRAb<ORGANIZATION> in CSF<ORGANIZATION> and serum. The subject was treated with ganciclovir, antiepileptic, and antipyretic therapy. The subject was living a virtually normal life with persistent mild memory disturbance. MRI<ORGANIZATION> showed that the abnormal signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum had disappeared, but hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR<ORGANIZATION> imaging was noted in the centrum semiovale. MERS<ORGANIZATION> is a rare clinicoradiological syndrome, which can manifest as severe symptoms as well. Early diagnosis and treatment should be emphasized, and the diagnostic value of MRI<ORGANIZATION> is highlighted. Clinicians<PERSON> should be alert to the potential sequela.
