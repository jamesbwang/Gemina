 Acromioclavicular joint instability following distal clavicle resection can result in considerable pain and dysfunction. We present a review of 13 patients who underwent ACJ<ORGANIZATION> stabilization following one or more distal clavicle resection procedures. The mean Quick DASH<PERSON> and CM<ORGANIZATION> scores were 26 ( 0-57 ) and 73 ( 46-100 ) respectively. All but one patient reported an improvement in the pain component of their CM score and in the work component of the Quick<ORGANIZATION> DASH score. Open ACJ<ORGANIZATION> stabilization to treat instability following distal clavicle resection resulted in improved functional scores, pain scores and facilitated return to work in most patients.Level of evidence IV.
