 Animal<GPE> studies demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists reduce myocardial necrosis following regional ischaemia induction. This effect may improve cardiovascular outcomes after myocardial infarction. Risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure after myocardial infarction was evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk in the LEADER<ORGANIZATION> trial. Data from patients randomised to liraglutide or placebo, in addition to standard of care, in Liraglutide<GPE> Effect and Action in Diabetes<GPE>: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results<PERSON> ( LEADER<ORGANIZATION> ) ( NCT01179048<ORGANIZATION> ) were analysed post hoc. Cox<PERSON> regression, with myocardial infarction as a time-dependent covariate, was used to analyse time from randomisation to a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. Patients who experienced myocardial infarction had a sevenfold higher risk of the composite endpoint ( with myocardial infarction: n = 148, 25.0 % ; without myocardial infarction: n = 716, 8.2 % ; hazard ratio: 7.0 ; 95 % confidence interval: 5.8, 8.4 ). The risk of the composite endpoint after myocardial infarction was not significantly lower in the liraglutide group ( n = 63, 23.0 % ) compared with placebo ( n = 85, 26.7 % ; hazard ratio: 0.91 ; 95 % confidence interval: 0.66, 1.26 ). The data demonstrated that having myocardial infarction significantly increased the risk of subsequent cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. However, we did not find evidence for a reduced risk in these cardiovascular outcomes following myocardial infarction in patients treated with liraglutide versus placebo.
