 To determine the prevalence of arthritis in Kawasaki<GPE> disease ( KD ) and the clinical characteristics of children with KD<ORGANIZATION> and arthritis. This was a single-centre, 15-year, retrospective study of children admitted with KD<ORGANIZATION>. Clinical<PERSON> features ( including coronary involvement ), laboratory results and treatment response were evaluated. Of 63 children with KD<ORGANIZATION>, 60.3 % were male, with a median of age of 2.0 years. Complete<ORGANIZATION> KD was found in 68.3 %. The time from symptom onset to treatment was 7.0 days ( median ) ; 30.7 % had coronary artery aneurysms, from which 82.5 % responded to intravenous immunoglobulin. During the course of their illness, eight children developed arthritis ( 12.7 % ), which was early onset in six ( 75 % ) and oligoarticular in five ( 62.5 % ). The median number of joints was 3.5 ( P This study emphasises the value of a systematic articular examination of joints in KD. Refractory KD<PERSON> was observed in children with late-onset arthritis.
