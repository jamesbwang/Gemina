 TRIM37 gene mutations cause mulibrey ( muscle-liver-brain-eye) nanism , a severe growth disorder with prenatal onset. Although TRIM37 depletion normally induces apoptosis , patients with TRIM37 mutations have a high risk of developing tumors , suggesting that there may be an alternative pro-survival mechanism for TRIM37-deficient tumor cells. We find that TRIM37 interacts with MTOR and RRAGB proteins , enhances the MTOR-RRAGB interaction and promotes lysosomal localization of MTOR , thereby activating amino acid-stimulated MTORC1 signaling. In response to loss<symptom> of TRIM37 functions , phosphorylation of TFEB is significantly reduced , resulting in its translocation into the nucleus enabling its transcriptional activation of genes involved in lysosome biogenesis and macroautophagy/autophagy. The enhanced autophagy depends on the inhibition of MTORC1 signaling and may serve as an alternative mechanism to survive the loss of TRIM37 functions. Our study unveils a positive role of TRIM37 in regulating the MTORC1-TFEB axis and provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of mulibrey nanism , as well as potential therapeutic treatment.
