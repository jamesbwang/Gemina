 This study aimed to assess the relationship between weight<symptom> gain from early adulthood and visceral fat accumulation. The participants were 549 men aged 42 to 64 years who were randomly selected from the local resident registry for the National Institute for Longevity Sciences ' neighbourhood. They were asked to recall their weight<symptom> at 18 years of age , and then , post-18 weight-change values were calculated for each participant ( their current weight<symptom> minus their weight<symptom> at 18). The participants were divided according to their median body mass index ( BMI) at 18 years of age ( initial BMI) ( < 20.14 and â‰¥ 20.14 kg m The participants with initial BMI of < 20.14 kg m Visceral fat accumulation is affected not only by an individual 's post-18 weight<symptom> gain but also by their initial BMI. Men who were thin in early adulthood experienced greater weight<symptom> gain-associated VFA increases , but the same was not true for SFA.
