 The tick-borne bacterium<pathogen> Candidatus<pathogen> ( Ca.) Neoehrlichia ( N.) mikurensis is a cause of `` fever<symptom> of unknown origin '' because this strict intracellular pathogen escapes detection by routine blood cultures. Case reports suggest that neoehrlichiosis patients may display serological reactivity to Anaplasma (<pathogen> A.)<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen>. Since Anaplasma serology is part of the diagnostic work-up of undetermined fever<symptom> in European tick-exposed patients , we wanted to investigate ( 1) the prevalence of A.<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> seropositivity among neoehrlichiosis patients , ( 2) the frequency of misdiagnosed neoehrlichiosis patients among A.<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> seropositive patients , and ( 3) the frequency of A.<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> and Ca. N. mikurensis co-infections. Neoehrlichiosis patients ( n = 18) were analyzed for A.<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> IgM and IgG serum antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Serum samples from suspected anaplasmosis<disease> patients ( n = 101) were analyzed for bacterial DNA contents by singleplex PCR specific for A.<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> and Ca. N. mikurensis , respectively. One fifth of the neoehrlichiosis patients ( 4/18) were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG to A.<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> at the time of diagnosis. Among the patients with suspected anaplasmosis<disease> , 2 % ( 2/101) were positive for Ca. N. mikurensis by PCR whereas none ( 0/101) had detectable A.<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> DNA in the serum. To conclude , patients with suspected anaplasmosis<disease> may in fact have neoehrlichiosis. We found no evidence of A.<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> and Ca. N. mikurensis co-infections in humans with suspected anaplasmosis<disease> or confirmed neoehrlichiosis.
