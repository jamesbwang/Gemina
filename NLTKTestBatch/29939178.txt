 Pancreatic cancer ( PC) , a disease<disease> which kills approximately 40,000 patients each year in the US , has successfully evaded several therapeutic approaches including the promising immunotherapeutic strategies. Irreversible electroporation ( IRE) is a non-thermal ablation technique that induces tumor cell death without destruction of adjacent collagenous structures , thus enabling the procedure to be performed in tumors very close to blood vessels. Unlike thermal ablation techniques , IRE results in gradual apoptotic cell death , along with immediate ablation induced necrosis<symptom> , and is currently in clinical use for selected patients with locally advanced PC. An ablative , non-target specific procedure like IRE can induce a myriad of responses in the tumor microenvironment. A few studies have addressed the effects of IRE on tumor growth in other tumor types , but none have focused on PC. We have developed a syngeneic mouse model of PC in which subcutaneous ( SQ) and orthotopic tumors can be successfully treated with IRE in a highly controlled setting , facilitating various longitudinal studies post procedure. This animal model serves as a robust system to study the effects of IRE and ways to improve the clinical efficacy of IRE.
