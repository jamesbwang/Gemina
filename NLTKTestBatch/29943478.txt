 A cell is able to sense the biomechanical properties of the environment such as the rigidity of the extracellular matrix and adapt its tension via regulation of plasma membrane and underlying actomyosin meshwork properties. The cell 's ability to adapt to the changing biomechanical environment is important for cellular homeostasis and also cell dynamics such as cell growth and<symptom> motility<symptom>. Membrane trafficking has emerged as an important mechanism to regulate cell biomechanics. In this review , we summarize the current understanding of the role of cell mechanics in exocytosis , and reciprocally , the role of exocytosis in regulating cell mechanics. We also discuss how cell mechanics and membrane trafficking , particularly exocytosis , can work together to regulate cell polarity and<symptom> motility<symptom>.
