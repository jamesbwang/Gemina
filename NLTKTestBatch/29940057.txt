 The management of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) has changed dramatically over the past few years due to our expanded knowledge of the molecular basis of lung cancer ( driver mutations and immune targets) and drugs that affect these pathways , namely targeted agents and checkpoint inhibitors. Consequently , it is important to test patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC for potentially significant molecular abnormalities prior to the initiation of treatment. This requires close coordination<symptom> between the surgical pathologist , the molecular pathologist , and the medical oncologist to ensure that the biopsy specimen is used judiciously to get all necessary information. In this article , I suggest an approach to the diagnostic evaluation of patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC , in an attempt to identify the best treatment options for each.
