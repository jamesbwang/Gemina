 Temporal lobe epilepsy with amygdala enlargement ( TLE-AE) is increasingly recognized as a distinct adult electroclinical syndrome<symptom>. However , functional consequences of morphological alterations of the amygdala in TLE-AE are poorly understood. Here , two emotional stimulation designs were employed to investigate subjective emotional rating and skin conductance responses in a sample of treatment-na√Øve patients with suspected or confirmed autoimmune TLE-AE ( n = 12) in comparison to a healthy control group ( n = 16). A subgroup of patients completed follow-up measurements after treatment. As compared to healthy controls , patients with suspected or confirmed autoimmune TLE-AE showed markedly attenuated skin conductance responses and arousal ratings , especially pronounced for anxiety-inducing stimuli. The degree of right amygdala enlargement was significantly correlated with the degree of autonomic arousal attenuation. Furthermore , a decline of amygdala enlargement following prompt aggressive immunotherapy in one patient suffering from severe confirmed autoimmune TLE-AE with a very recent clinical onset was accompanied by a significant improvement of autonomic responses. Findings suggest dual impairments of autonomic and cognitive discrimination of stimulus arousal as hallmarks of emotional processing in TLE-AE. Emotional responses might , at least partially , recover after successful treatment , as implied by first single case data.
