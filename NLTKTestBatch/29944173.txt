 Renalase is a catecholamine-metabolising enzyme , but its possible association with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> remains unknown. The study aimed to evaluate plasma renalase concentration in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) undergoing pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI) with respect to AF clinical characteristics , left atrial<symptom> ( LA) remodeling and PVI efficacy. This case-control study covered 69 patients ( median age of 58 years) with either paroxysmal ( 89 %) or persistent AF ( 11 %) , subject to PVI and control group consisting of 15 equally matched patients without AF. The study involved evaluation of transthoracic echocardiography with LA speckle tracking and plasma renalase concentration using ELISA method. AF recurrence was defined as any AF episode on 7-day electrocardiographic monitoring at 6-month follow-up. Renalase level was higher in the study than control group ( 27.99 vs. 21.48 μg/mL , p = 0.004) , but lower in patients with persistent AF ( 19.05 vs. 28.77 μg/mL; p = 0.023) and among patients with AF episodes directly preceding PVI ( 24.50 vs. 29.66 μg/mL; p = 0.04). Renalase concentration within first quartile was associated with higher mean heart rate ( 70 vs. 61/min , p = 0.029) , greater AF burden ( 36.9 % vs. 9.3 % , p = 0.027) , greater LA diameter ( 41.1 vs. 37.9 mm , p = 0.011) and a trend towards less negative global LA strain ( -9.4 vs. -13.5 , p = 0.082). Logistic regression revealed global 4-chamber LA strain was the only independent predictor of renalase variability ( p = 0.0045). Renalase concentration did not predict AF recurrence at 6-month follow-up ( area under curve; AUC = 0.614 , p = 0.216). Low renalase levels may be associated with impaired rate control , higher AF burden and advanced LA remodeling in AF patients undergoing PVI but do not predict sinus rhythm maintenance.
