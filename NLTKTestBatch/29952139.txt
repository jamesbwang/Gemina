 Fibromyalgia is a complex syndrome<symptom> characterized by chronic widespread pain and a heightened response to pressure<symptom>. Most medical researches pointed out that fibromyalgia patients with endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness. A continuous-wave NIRS system is used in present study to measure the hemodynamic changes elicited by breath-holding task in patients with fibromyalgia. Each patient completed a questionnaire survey including demographics , characteristics of body<symptom> pain<symptom> , associated symptoms<symptom> , headache<symptom> profiles , and Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale. A total of twenty-seven fibromyalgia ( FM) patients and twenty-six health controls were enrolled. In comparison with healthy controls , patients with FM showed lower maximal and averaged change of oxyhemoglobin concentration in both the left ( 1.634 ± 0.890 μM and 0.810 ± 0.525 μM) and the right<symptom> ( 1.576 ± 0.897 μM and 0.811 ± 0.601 μM) prefrontal cortex than healthy controls ( p < 0.05 for both sides) during the breath-holding task. In conclusion , FM is associated with altered cerebrovascular reactivity measured by NIRS and breath-holding task , which may reflect endothelial dysfunction or arterial stiffness.
