 Insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1) signaling regulates breast cancer initiation and progression and associated cancer phenotypes. We previously identified E-cadherin ( Breast cancer cell lines were used to assess how altered E-cadherin levels regulate IGF1R signaling and<symptom> response<symptom> to two anti-IGF1R/ InsR therapies. Diminished functional E-cadherin increased both activation of IGF1R signaling and efficacy to anti-IGF1R/ InsR therapies. PLA demonstrated a direct endogenous interaction between IGF1R and E-cadherin at points of cell-cell contact. Increased expression of IGF1 ligand and levels of IGF1R/InsR phosphorylation were observed in E-cadherin deficient ER+ILC compared to IDC tumors. IGF1R pathway inhibitors were effective in inhibiting growth in ER + ILC cell lines and synergized with endocrine therapy and similarly IGF1R/InsR inhibition reduced proliferation in ILC tumor explant culture. We provide evidence that loss of E-cadherin hyperactivates the IGF1R pathway and increases sensitivity to IGF1R/InsR targeted therapy , thus identifying the IGF1R pathway as a potential novel target in E-cadherin deficient breast cancers.
