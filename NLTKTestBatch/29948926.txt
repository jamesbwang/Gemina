 Therapies may be more efficacious when targeting a patient subpopulation with specific attributes , thereby enhancing the cost-effectiveness of treatment. In the CRYSTAL study , patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC) were treated with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI alone until disease<disease> progression , unacceptable toxic effects or withdrawal<symptom> of consent. To determine if stratified use of cetuximab based on genetic biomarker detection improves cost-effectiveness. We used individual patient data from CRYSTAL to compare the cost-effectiveness , cost per life-year ( LY) and cost per quality-adjusted LY ( QALY) gained of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone in three cohorts of patients with mCRC: all randomised patients ( intent-to-treat; ITT) , tumours with no detectable mutations in codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 of the KRAS protein ( ` KRAS wt ') and no detectable mutations in exons 2 , 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons 2 , 3 and 4 of NRAS ( ` RAS wt '). Survival analysis was conducted using RStudio , and a cost-utility model was modified to allow comparison of the three cohorts. The deterministic base-case ICER ( cost per QALY gained) was # 130,929 in the ITT , # 72,053 in the KRAS wt and # 44,185 in the RAS wt cohorts for cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with FOLFIRI alone. At a # 50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold , cetuximab plus FOLFIRI has a 2.8 , 20 and 63 % probability of being cost-effective for the ITT , KRAS wt and RAS wt cohorts , respectively , versus FOLFIRI alone. Screening for mutations in both KRAS and NRAS may provide the most cost-effective approach to patient selection.
