 Occupational and environmental exposures to organophosphorus pesticides ( OPs) are associated with increased incidence of asthma and other pulmonary diseases<disease>. While the canonical mechanism of OP neurotoxicity is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) , it was previously reported that the OP chlorpyrifos ( CPF) causes airway hyperreactivity ( AHR) in guinea pigs at levels that do not inhibit lung or brain AChE. The guinea pig is considered to have inherently hyperresponsive airways , thus , cross-species validation is needed to confirm relevance to humans. Additionally , sex differences in asthma incidence have been demonstrated in the human population , but whether OP-induced AHR is sex-dependent has not been systematically studied in a preclinical model. In this study , eight-week old male and female Sprague Dawley rats were administered CPF at doses causing comparable AChE inhibition in whole lung homogenate ( 30 mg/kg in males , 7 mg/kg in females , sc) prior to assessing pulmonary mechanics in response to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves<symptom> at 24 h , 48 h , 72 h , 7 d or 14 d post-exposure in males , and 24 h or 7 d post-exposure in females. CPF significantly potentiated vagally-induced airway resistance and tissue elastance at 7 d post-exposure in males , and at 24 h and 7 d post-exposure in females. These effects occurred independent of significant AChE inhibition in cerebellum , blood , trachealis , or isolated airway , suggesting that AChE-independent OP-induced airway hyperreactivity is a cross-species phenomenon. These findings have significant implications for assessing the risk posed by CPF , and potentially other OPs , to human health and safety.
