 As the prevalence of coronary computed tomographic angiography ( CCTA) , it is meaningful that CCTA can provide not only the structural details of artery , but also functional information of vessel elasticity. Our aim was to explore the elasticity characteristics of ascending aorta ( AA) , descending aorta ( DA) , main pulmonary artery ( MPA) , left pulmonary artery ( LPA) , right pulmonary artery ( RPA) , and their relationship between each other using 640 slice-volume computed tomography ( CT). Furthermore , this study will also observe their relations with age.A total of 42 subjects that were free of cardiovascular disease<disease> , high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , diabetes , and hyperlipidemia underwent CCTA on 640 slice-volume CT and were enrolled in this study. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 , age < 46; Group 2 , age â‰¥ 46. The aortic distensibility ( AD) and aortic compliance ( AC) of aorta and pulmonary artery ( PA) of each group were compared.The AD and AC of PA decreased in the following order: MPA , RPA , and LPA. The correlation coefficients of different elastic parameters between different vessels were found to be different. The correlation coefficient of AD between AA and DA , AA and MPA , DA and MPA , RPA and MPA , LPA and MPA , and RPA and LPA were 0.689 ( P = .000) , 0.520 ( P = .000) , 0.393 ( P = .010) , 0.329 ( P = .033) , 0.579 ( P = .000) , and 0.534 ( P = .000) , respectively. The correlation coefficients of AC for the 6 groups mentioned above were 0.351 ( P = .023) , 0.470 ( P = .002) , 0.249 ( P = .112) , 0.190 ( P = .228) , 0.441 ( P = .005) , and 0.409 ( P = .010) , respectively. There was an age-dependent decrease of AD and AC in AA , DA , MPA , LPA ( P < .05) , but no difference in RPA ( P > .05). The elasticity characteristics of AA , DA , MPA , LPA , and RPA could be well shown by 640 slice-volume CT.. The elasticity relativity was observed and was different between AA and DA , AA and MPA , LPA and MPA , LPA and RPA. An obvious age-related decrease in vascular elasticity was found in AA , DA , MPA , and LPA , which should be taken into consideration in clinical trials and treatments for the elasticity-related cardiovascular diseases<disease>.
