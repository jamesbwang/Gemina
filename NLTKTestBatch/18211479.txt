 Cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> ( CL) is a world-wide health problem which currently lacks effective , affordable and easy to use therapy. Recently , the meglumine antimoniate ( MA) intralesional infiltration was included among the acceptable therapies for New World leishmaniasis<disease>. While this approach is attractive , there is currently little evidence to support its use in Americas. The aim of this study was to provide information about effectiveness and safety of a standardised MA intralesional infiltration technique for the treatment of CL. It is a single-arm phase II clinical trial conducted at a Brazilian referral centre. CL cases with parasitological confirmation presenting a maximum of three CL-compatible skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> were treated with weekly MA intralesional infiltration by using a validated technique , up to a maximum of eight infiltrations. A total of 53 patients ( 62 lesions<symptom>) were included. Overall , patients received a median of seven infiltrations ( IQR25-75 % 5-8) over a median treatment period of 43 days ( IQR25-75 % 28-52 days). The definitive cure rate at D180 was 87 % ( 95 % CI: 77-96 %). The majority of adverse events were local , with mild or moderate intensity. Bacterial secondary infection<disease> of the lesion<symptom> site was observed in 13 % of the treated patients , beside two intensity-three adverse events ( hypersensitivity<disease> reactions).
