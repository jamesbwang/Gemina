 We here report a case of a 32-year-old man with genetically diagnosed myotonic dystrophy and persistent atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) who underwent a low-voltage zone ( LVZ) ablation. His cardiac function was normal except for a prophylactic pacemaker implantation for a high risk of complete atrioventricular block. An LVZ was found in the anteroseptal left atrium during sinus rhythm and was ablated during induced AF after a pulmonary vein antrum isolation , which terminated the AF and rendered it noninducible by rapid pacing and/or isoproterenol. During 20 months of follow-up , no atrial tachyarrhythmias were observed with pacemaker monitoring of antiarrhythmic drugs.
