 Visceral artery aneurysms<disease> ( VAA) are an uncommon but well recognized condition. Hepatic artery aneurysms<disease> ( HAA) represent 14-20 % of all visceral artery aneurysms<disease>. Post traumatic hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm is an uncommon delayed complication of blunt liver trauma. Here we present a case of a 27 year old male with blunt abdominal trauma who developed a post traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery just proximal to its bifurcation into the left and right branches. The pseudoaneurysm ruptured within 12 hours of injury and he required double ligation of the hepatic artery as well as right<symptom> and left hepatic arteries. However , the bleeding continued through the retrograde flow from the gastroduodenal artery and hence , ligation of gastrodudenal artery was also done. The decision of complete devasularisation of liver was taken as an emergency lifesaving procedure. The patient recovered and was discharged without sequel.
