 There is confusion<symptom> in all of healthcare , including oculofacial surgery , as to what is ` complex ' and what is ` merely complicated '. Although in common usage , these terms tend to be interchangeable , the distinction is more than trivial. A different and somewhat unfamiliar toolset is needed to successfully navigate complex problems. This review will explore a methodology for the physician to understand what is complex in oculofacial surgery , the tools needed to optimize performance in a complex healthcare system and successfully manage patients with complex<disease> diseases<disease>. A specific understanding of complexity science in oculofacial surgery is only in its nascent beginnings at this point. Nevertheless , recent advances in closely related fields can provide concrete applications. The practice of oculofacial surgery is optimized within a healthcare network of supporting professionals. Moreover , a newer understanding of the ` complex ' nature of disease<disease> common to oculofacial surgery , such as neoplasia and inflammation<symptom> , will direct the physician to recognize the most appropriate therapies. Oculofacial surgery , like all of medicine , is a fluid mixture of problems that are complex and those that are merely complicated. As a different toolset is needed to deal with each , physicians need to recognize these differences and acquire those tools.
