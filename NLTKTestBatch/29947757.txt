 Metagenomics investigates the DNA sequences directly recovered from environmental samples. It often starts with reads assembly , which leads to contigs rather than more complete genomes. Therefore , contig binning methods are subsequently used to bin contigs into genome bins. While some clustering-based binning methods have been developed , they generally suffer from problems related to stability and robustness. We introduce BMC3C , an ensemble clustering-based method , to accurately and robustly bin contigs by making use of DNA sequence Composition , Coverage across multiple samples , and Codon usage. BMC3C begins by searching the proper number of clusters and repeatedly applying the k-means clustering with different initializations to cluster contigs. Next , a weight<symptom> graph with each node representing a contig is derived from these clusters. If two contigs are frequently grouped into the same cluster , the weight<symptom> between them is high , and otherwise low. BMC3C finally employs a graph partitioning technique to partition the weight<symptom> graph into subgraphs , each corresponding to a genome bin. We conduct experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets to evaluate BMC3C , and compare it with the state-of-the-art binning tools. We show that BMC3C has an improved performance than these tools. To our knowledge , this is the first time that the codon usage features and ensemble clustering are used in metagenomic contig binning and lead to improved performance of binning methods.
