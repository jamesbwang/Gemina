 To discuss the association of the T786C and G894T polymorphisms of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS) with the occurrence and prognosis of aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( aSAH). One hundred sixty-nine patients with aSAH were collected as the case group , which was divided into the good prognosis group and adverse prognosis group according to the condition 3 months after the treatment. One hundred fifty-six healthy volunteers were collected as the control group. The allele and genotype of T786C and G894T polymorphisms of eNOS were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP). The genotype and allele frequency of eNOS were compared between different groups. And then , the risk factors of aSAH occurrence and prognosis were analyzed by using the logistic regression model. Both the genotype and allele frequency distributions of T786C and G894T between the case group and control group were significantly different ( P < 0.05). There were significant differences in the distribution of G894T and T786C allele frequency and G894T genotype between the good prognosis group and adverse prognosis group , and there was no difference in T786C genotype. The results of the logistic regression analysis indicated that T786C and G894T polymorphisms of eNOS were independent influencing factors on the occurrence of aSAH and the G894T polymorphism was also closely related to the prognosis. T786C and G894T polymorphisms of eNOS gene were correlated with the occurrence and prognosis of aSAH , and the G894T polymorphism might be an independent influencing factor.
