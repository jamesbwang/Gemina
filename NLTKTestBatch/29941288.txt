 Hilar malignancy can occasionally be associated with high grade dysplasia ( HGD) adjacent to invasive malignancy. For patients with HGD extending into the intrapancreatic bile duct , the authors adopted intrapancreatic bile duct resection ( IP-BDR). The aims of this study were to compare the incidence of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> ( CR-POPF) , distal R0 resection and local recurrence within the distal bile duct remnant for patients undergoing extrahepatic bile duct resection without pancreaticoduodenectomy ( with or without IP-BDR). Patients who presented with hilar malignancy and underwent extrahepatic bile duct resection without pancreaticoduodenectomy between January 2005 and December 2016 were identified and the outcomes retrospectively evaluated. Of 217 patients who met the inclusion criteria 62 ( 29 %) patients underwent IP-BDR. There was a significant difference between patients undergoing standard resection vs. IP-BDR in terms of CR-POPF ( 5 % ( 8/155) patients: vs 18 % ( 11/62) , p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between two groups of R0 status<symptom> on distal margin ( 5 % ( 8/155) patients: vs 10 % ( 6/62) , p = 0.359). No patient developed recurrence within the residual intrapancreatic bile duct. The incidence of CR-POPF after IP-BDR for hilar malignancies was 18 %. IP-BDR was associated with CR-POF , but does not appear to alter survival or local recurrence rate.
