 Chiral lanthanide helical architectures have received intense attentions in recent years because of their potential applications as chiral probes and sensors and as circularly polarized luminescence ( CPL) materials. However , stereoselectivity control in the self-assembly of lanthanide helicate is challenging due to the poor stereochemical preference and variable coordination<symptom> numbers of Ln ( III) ions. Herein , we reported the employing chiral ancillary ligand R/S-BINAPO to induce achiral tripodal ligand to form a pair of homochiral lanthanide triple-helical podates ( Eu ( TTEA) ( ( R/S)- BINAPO); R/S -1) ( ( R/S)- BINAPO = ( R/ S) -2,2 '- bis ( diphenylphosphoryl) -1,1 '- binaphthyl; TTEA = tris ( ( 4- ( 4,4,4-trifluoro-1,3-dioxobutyl)- benzamido) ethyl) amine). X-ray crystallographic analysis for rac-1 reveals that the chirality of BINAPO is transferred during the self-assembly process to give either P or M helical architectures in podates. The
