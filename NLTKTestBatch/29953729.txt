 To determine the minimum clinically important difference ( MCID) of the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-22) in individuals undergoing medical management for their chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS). Prospective observational study. Academic , tertiary care center. A total of 247 adults undergoing medical management for CRS. At enrollment , participants completed a SNOT-22. At a subsequent follow-up visit , two to twelve months after enrollment , participants also completed a SNOT-22. At follow-up , participants also rated the change in their sinus symptoms<symptom> and general health as `` Much worse '' , `` A little worse '' , `` About the same '' , `` A little better '' or `` Much better '' compared to enrollment; these two questions were used as sinus symptom<symptom> and general health anchor questions , respectively. The SNOT-22 MCID was calculated using distribution-based , anchor-based , and receiver operator characteristic ( ROC) curve-based methods. Using the distribution-based method , the SNOT-22 MCID was 11.6. Using the sinus symptom<symptom> anchor question , the SNOT-22 MCID was 10.5; applying the ROC method to the sinus symptom<symptom> anchor yielded an MCID of 12.5. In comparison , using the general health anchor question , the SNOT-22 MCID was 8.3; applying the ROC method to the sinus symptom<symptom> anchor yielded an MCID of 17.5. In all cases , the calculated MCID had a sensitivity of approximately 50-60 % and specificity of approximately 80-90 %. Based on our results , we propose a SNOT-22 MCID of 12 in medically managed CRS patients. The MCID , while specific , was not sensitive for identifying CRS patients experiencing a noticeable improvement in sinus symptoms<symptom> or general health. This article is protected by copyright.
