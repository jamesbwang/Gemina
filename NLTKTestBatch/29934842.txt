 Investigating oncological outcomes in patients registered in the Japanese Prostate Cancer Outcome Study of Permanent Iodine-125 Seed Implantation ( J-POPS) in terms of biochemical relapse-free survival ( bRFS) by the Phoenix and the newly developed J-POPS definitions , exploration of predictive factors for bRFS , and preliminary verification of pitfalls of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) failure definitions. Between July 2005 and June 2007 , 2316 clinically localized patients underwent permanent seed implantation. The primary endpoint was bRFS. One of the secondary endpoints was overall survival ( OS). The median age was 69 and performance status<symptom> was 0 in 99.1 % of participants. The median biologically effective dose ( BED) was about 180 Gy The world 's largest registration study , J-POPS , consisted of patients with longevity , and a highly quality-controlled BED resulted in excellent bRFS and OS. The high likelihood of PSA bounce by the Phoenix definition should be taken into account , especially in younger patients. NCT00534196.
