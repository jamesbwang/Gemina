 The Epstein-Barr<disease> virus<pathogen> ( EBV) is a DNA lymphotropic herpesvirus<pathogen> and the causative agent of infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease>. EBV is highly prevalent since it affects more than 90 % of individuals worldwide and has been linked to several malignancies including PTLDs , which are one of the most common malignancies following transplantation. Among all the EBV genes , most of the recent investigations focused on studying the LMP-1 oncogene because of its high degree of polymorphism and association with tumorigenic activity. There are two main EBV genotypes , Type 1 and 2 , distinguished by the differences in the EBNA-2 gene. Further sub genotyping can be characterized by analyzing the LMP-1 gene variation. The virus<pathogen> primarily transmits through oral secretions and persists as a latent infection<disease> in human B-cells. However , it can be transmitted through organ transplantations and blood transfusions. In addition , symptoms<symptom> of EBV infection<disease> are not distinguishable from other viral<disease> infections<disease>infections<disease> , and therefore , it remains questionable whether there is a need to screen for EBV prior to blood transfusion. Although the process of leukoreduction decreases the viral copies present in the leukocytes , it does not eliminate the risk of EBV transmission through blood products. Here , we provide a review of the EBV epidemiology and the genetic variability of the oncogene LMP-1. Then , we underscore the findings of recent EBV seroprevalence and viremia studies among blood donors as a highly prevalent transfusion transmissible oncovirus<pathogen>.
