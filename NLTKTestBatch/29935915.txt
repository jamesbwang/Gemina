 Thyrotropin-releasing hormone ( TRH) causes a variety of thyroidal and non-thyroidal effects , the best known being the feedback regulation of thyroid hormone levels. This was employed in the TRH stimulation test , which is currently little used. The role of TRH as a cancer biomarker is minor , but exaggerated responses to TSH and prolactin levels in breast cancer led to the hypothesis of a potential role for TRH in the pathogenesis of this disease<disease>. TRH is a rapidly degraded peptide with multiple targets , limiting its suitability as a biomarker and drug candidate. Although some studies reported efficacy in neural diseases<disease> ( depression<symptom> , spinal<disease> cord injury , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , etc.) , therapeutic use of TRH is presently restricted to spinocerebellar degenerative disease<disease>. Regulation of TRH production in the hypothalamus , patterns of expression of TRH and its receptor in the body , its role in energy metabolism and in prolactin secretion are addressed in this review.
