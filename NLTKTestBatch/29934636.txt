 To evaluate the relationship between the presence of ectopic inner foveal layers ( EIFL) , choroidal thickness , and visual acuity ( VA) in patients with epiretinal membranes<symptom> ( ERM) staged by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT). A total of 242 eyes of 121 patients with unilateral idiopathic ERM were prospectively evaluated. ERM stages were defined based on the SD-OCT staging system as stage 1: negligible morphological or anatomical disruption , retinal layers , and foveal pit are identified; stage 2: characteristic stretching of the outer nuclear layer , absence of foveal depression<symptom> , retinal layers are identified; stage 3: continuous EIFL crossing the central foveal area , absence of foveal depression<symptom> , retinal layers are identified; and stage 4: anatomical disruption of the fovea , continuous EIFL crossing the entire foveal area , retinal layers are distorted. Of 121 eyes with ERM , 23.1 % had stage 1 , 26.5 % had stage 2 , 39.7 % had stage 3 , and 10.7 % had stage 4 disease<disease>. VA was better in eyes with stage 1 or 2 ERM than stage 3 or 4 ERM ( p < 0.001). VA in logMAR was positively correlated with central foveal thickness ( r = 0.557 , p < 0.001) and EIFL thickness ( r = 0.526 , p < 0.001) , but not with an outer nuclear layer thickness ( r = 0.233 , p = 0.123). In multivariate analysis , the presence of EIFL was an independent predictor of VA in eyes with ERM ( p < 0.001). The presence and stage of ERM did not have a significant effect on choroidal thickness ( p > 0.05). The SD-OCT staging system according to the presence of EIFL is effective for grading retinal damage and visual loss in eyes with ERM.
