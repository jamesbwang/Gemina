 Esophageal injury ( EI) is a serious complication that occurs after catheter ablation of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) , however predictable factor of EI is unclear. Among 308 patients who underwent AF ablation , upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy was performed the next day after ablation to examine for EI. To define the primary factor that predicts EI , patients ' characteristics , number and amount of radiofrequency energy applied to the posterior wall , ablation procedure , and the shortest distance between esophagus and posterior left atrium measured on contrast computed tomography ( SD-CT) were analyzed. EI was found in 27 patients ( 8.8 %). There were no significant differences in the patient characteristics , number and amount of radiofrequency energy applied to posterior wall or ablation procedure between patients with ( Injury Group) and without EI ( Non-Injury Group). However , SD-CT in the Injury Group was significantly shorter than that in Non-Injury Group ( 2.3 ± 0.6 mm vs 4.1 ± 0.9 mm , p < 0.001). The area under a receiver operating characteristic curve using SD-CT as a predictive marker in EI patients was 0.988 ( p < 0.001). When the cut-off value of SD-CT was set at 2.9 mm , the sensitivity and specificity for EI diagnosis were 92.3 % and 96.8 % , and the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 0.75 and 0.99 , respectively. EI observed after catheter ablation of AF was closely associated with the SD-CT. Patients with SD-CT below 2.9 mm have a potential risk of EI and thus must be strictly followed.
