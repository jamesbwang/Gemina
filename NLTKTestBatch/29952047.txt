 Women with a family history of breast cancer ( BC) often overestimate their BC risk. Heightened psychological distress may interfere with risk comprehension and screening adherence. The primary purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a 12-week manual-based supportive-expressive ( SE) group intervention for this population. Using a randomized control trial design , this study compared two interventions: a standard risk-counselling arm ( RC) compared to that plus SE group intervention. The primary study outcome was breast cancer anxiety<symptom>. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial functioning , risk comprehension , BC knowledge and screening behaviours. 161 women with a family history of BC were randomized into SE ( N = 108) or RC ( N = 53). Participants in both study arms<symptom> significantly improved on measures of BC anxiety<symptom> , psychosocial functioning , risk comprehension and BC knowledge , with no statistical difference between study arms<symptom>. Benefits were sustained at one year. BC screening rates were high in both arms<symptom> at baseline and follow-up. SE group therapy as an added intervention to the risk counselling was well-received , however , did not demonstrate superiority to RC alone. Future studies on treatment matching are needed to further our understanding of interventions that can support women with a family history of BC to work through residual issues , including loss and grief.
