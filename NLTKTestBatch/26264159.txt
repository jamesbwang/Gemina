 The objective of the present study was to investigate the survival outcome and prognostic factors of metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients treated with second-line systemic chemotherapy in real-world clinical practice. Overall , 114 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma undergoing second-line systemic chemotherapy were included in this retrospective analysis. The dominant second-line chemotherapy was a paclitaxel-based combination regimen ( 60 % , 68/114). We assessed the progression-free survival and overall survival times using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was applied to identify the factors affecting overall survival. The median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 4 and 9 months , respectively. In the multivariate analysis , an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score greater than 0 at presentation , C-reactive protein level â‰§ 1 mg/dl and poor<symptom> response<symptom> to prior chemotherapy were adverse prognostic indicators. Patients with 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 of those risk factors had a median overall survival of 17 , 12 , 7 and 3 months , respectively. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at presentation , C-reactive protein level and response to prior chemotherapy were prognostic factors for metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients undergoing second-line chemotherapy. In the future , this information might help guide the choice of salvage treatment , such as second-line chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors , after the failure of first-line chemotherapy.
