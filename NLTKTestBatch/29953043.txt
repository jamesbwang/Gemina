 Early prediction of future functional capability is crucial for stroke survivors ' care management. The purposes of this study were to test the trajectory of change across time in activities of daily living ( ADLs) and to determine whether the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS) score within 24 hours poststroke , gender , and age predict ADLs at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months poststroke. A prospective cohort design was used. Baseline characteristics and neurological deficits were measured in 1,021 stroke survivors. The 13-item NIHSS was used to examine neurological status<symptom> within 24 hours poststroke. ADLs were measured with the Barthel index at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months poststroke. A latent growth curve model was used to analyze how the dynamic changes in ADLs were related to NIHSS score , gender , and age. The latent growth curve model analyses revealed that , as the time following a stroke increases , survivors tend to gradually improve with regard to ADLs. In addition , lower levels of initial ADLs were associated with higher growth in ADLs over time. However , after 6 months poststroke , further gains in ADLs slowed. Based on further analysis , the findings indicate that a lower NIHSS score , being male , and a young age at time of stroke were associated with higher initial levels of ADLs. Having a higher NIHSS score , being female , and a young age at time of stroke predicted an increase in ADLs over time. To promote ADLs of stroke patients , NIHSS score at admission , gender , and age should be included as important predictors of stroke care management. The results highlight that the rehabilitation of stroke patients should be focused more on ADLs at 1-6 months poststroke.
