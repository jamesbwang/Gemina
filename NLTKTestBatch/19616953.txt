 Anterior knee pain ( AKP) , a multifactorial symptom<symptom> complex , can be successfully treated surgically. A specific diagnosis often can not be made , but the pain is linked to an unrecognized common factor in most patients: the mechanical behavior of the non-isometric contents of the anterior compartment of the knee-the fat pad ( FP) and infrapatellar plica ( IPP). The objective of this presentation is to describe an effective arthroscopic technique that treats AKP by addressing this common factor. The operation consists of release or resection of the IPP , or ligamentum mucosum , which tethers the FP. These highly innervated tissues act together as a hydraulic shock<symptom> absorber , filling the anterior compartment. They stretch and deform at the extremes of knee motion because of constraint centrally by the non-isometric IPP. These dynamic changes in shape are eliminated when the plica is released or resected. Pain perception is from perturbed nociceptive nerves<symptom>: pain relief results from de-tensioning these contained nerves<symptom> by untethering the fat pad. Ascribing pain causation is problematic because morphologic change , such as inflammation<symptom> , fibrosis<disease> , or contracture of these structures , is only present in a minority of cases. Nonetheless , AKP is both physically linked to these central , pain-sensitive structures and relieved by this operation.
