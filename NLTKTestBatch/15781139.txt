 Simvastatin ( SIM) , a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor widely prescribed for hypercholesterolemia , has been reported to ameliorate inflammation<symptom> and promote osteogenesis. Its clinical applications on these potential secondary indications , however , have been hampered by its lack of osteotropicity and poor water solubility. To address this challenge , we propose to design and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a novel simvastatin prodrug with better water solubility and bone affinity. The prodrug ( SIM-PPi) was synthesized by directly conjugating a SIM trimer to a pyrophosphate ( PPi). It was characterized and evaluated in vitro for its water solubility , osteotropicity , toxicity , anti-inflammatory and osteoinductive properties. It was then tested for anti-inflammatory and osteoinductive properties in vivo by three weekly injections into gingiva of a ligature-induced experimental periodontitis<disease> rat model. In vitro studies showed that SIM-PPi has greatly improved water-solubility of SIM and shows strong binding to hydroxyapatite ( HA). In macrophage culture , SIM-PPi inhibited LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1Î² , IL-6). In osteoblast culture , it was found to significantly increase alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) activity with accelerated mineral deposition , confirming the osteogenic potential of SIM-PPi. When tested in vivo on an experimental periodontal bone-loss model , SIM-PPi exhibited a superior prophylactic effect compared to dose equivalent SIM in reducing inflammatory cells and in preserving alveolar bone structure , as shown in the histological and micro-CT data. SIM-PPi may have the potential to be further developed for better clinical management of bone loss associated with periodontitis<disease>.
