 Popularity has been examined extensively in recent years , particularly regarding its behavioral correlates. However , much less is known about the social cognitive processes related to popularity and the strategies to attain popularity. This study examined the longitudinal association between popularity goal and popularity status<symptom> by focusing on the mediation effects of perceived contributing behaviors for popularity ( i.e. , popularity determinants) and actual behaviors in a sample of 5th and 6th graders ( N = 382; 47 % girls) in China. The results revealed that participants ' popularity goal indirectly related to aggression , academic performance , and prosocial behaviors through the mediation of the corresponding popularity determinant perceptions. Furthermore , participants ' popularity goal longitudinally predicted their later popularity status<symptom> changes through the mediation of perceptions of prosocial behaviors as a popularity determinant and prosocial behaviors. The findings of this study were discussed in relationship to their cultural context.
