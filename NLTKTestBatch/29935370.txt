 Nutritional status is important to elders to live without disabilities. Food Insecurity ( FI) is a risk factor associated with poorer nutritional status among elderly as well as a social determinant. This research aimed to identify FI prevalence and to explore the relation between FI , weight<symptom> status<symptom> and socio-demographic factors. This cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2015 to February 2016 in Lisbon. Malnutrition was determined using Mini<pathogen> Nutritional Assessment ( MNA). FI was assessed using FIES ( Food Insecurity Experience Scale) and social risk using Gijon 's social-familiar evaluation scale. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and anthropometric indices were measured according to Isak procedures. A sample of 337 subjects , with an average age of 78.4 years old ( range 66-99) , mostly women ( n = 210; 62.3 %) were enrolled. 70.0 % were FI , whereas 40.7 % was at risk of malnutrition , 4.7 % were malnourished and 34.7 % of participants presented high social risk. Being a woman , FI , reported Depression<symptom> , Loneliness , Acute Myocardial Infarction , Cerebrovascular Accident , Diabetes , being aged 74-85 years old , Health status and attending SC for less than 5 years were contributors to risk of malnutrition/malnutrition. Lack of money , socialization as a reason for attending SC , Social Risk and Diabetes were related to FI. There was no correlation between FI and obesity , but a positive correlation between FI and weight was found. Nutritional status and food insecurity on the studied sample were associated with their health status and also with their social circumstances , such as diabetes , loneliness and lack of economic resources.
