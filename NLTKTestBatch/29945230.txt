 Baclofen , a Î³-amino-butyric acid type-B receptor agonist with exponentially increased use at high-dose to facilitate abstinence in chronic alcoholics , is responsible for increasing poisonings<disease>. Tolerance and withdrawal<symptom> syndromes<symptom> have been reported during prolonged treatment but their contribution to the variability of baclofen-induced neurotoxicity in overdose is unknown. We studied baclofen-induced effects on rat sedation , temperature , and ventilation and modeled baclofen pharmacokinetics and effect/concentration relationships aiming to investigate the consequences of repeated baclofen pretreatment and to characterize withdrawal<symptom> syndrome<symptom>. Baclofen-induced dose-dependent sedation ( p < 0.01) , hypothermia<symptom> ( p < .001) and respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> ( p < .01) were altered in repeatedly baclofen-pretreated rats ( p < .05). Repeatedly baclofen-pretreated rats did not exhibit respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> following baclofen overdose due to limitations on baclofen-induced increase in inspiratory ( p < .01) and expiratory times ( p < .01). Only slight hypoxemia<symptom> without respiratory acidosis was observed. Baclofen discontinuation resulted in hyperlocomotion and non-anxiogenic withdrawal<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. Regarding pharmacokinetics , repeated baclofen pretreatment increased the peak concentration ( p < .05) and absorption constant rate ( p < .05) and reduced the distribution volume ( p < .0001) and elimination half-life ( p < .05). Analysis of the effect/concentration relationships indicated that plasma baclofen concentration decreases more rapidly than all studied neuro-respiratory effects , in tolerant and non-tolerant rats. Taken together , our findings supported the role of brain distribution in baclofen-induced neurotoxicity expression and its probable involvement in tolerance-related attenuation in addition to physiological adaptations of ventilation. In conclusion , repeated pretreatment attenuates baclofen-attributed neurotoxicity in overdose and results in post-discontinuation withdrawal<symptom> syndrome<symptom>. Our findings suggest both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic mechanisms whose relative contributions to the variability of baclofen-induced neurotoxicity in overdose remain to be established.
