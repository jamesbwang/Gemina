 Despite the high popularity of Latin American dance and the specific movement patterns characteristic of this dance discipline , studies on the physical effects of these dance style specific movement patterns are still lacking. The purpose of the present study is to analyze strength level differences and shortening of relevant muscle groups resulting from formation dance , taking performance standard and gender into consideration. Furthermore , the correlation between the findings of muscle function tests ( MFT) and the occurrence of lumbar spine complaints is evaluated. A total of 66 participants ( m: n = 31 , f: n = 35) volunteered for this cross-sectional study ( examination group , n = 39 , m: n = 19 , f: n = 20). The control group consisted of n = 27 participants ( m: n = 12 , f: n = 15). Besides isometric maximal strength tests ( Digi Max system , mechaTronic) , relevant muscle groups were examined for shortenings ( hip flexors<symptom> , hamstrings). The male participants in dance sport reached a significantly higher strength level in the muscles of the spine region ( p = 0.011) than the participants of the control group. The female elite dance athletes developed a significantly higher strength level in the knee flexors<symptom> on the right side than the dancers of the advanced group ( NL) ( p = 0.021). At that , muscle shortening were observed that seem to be specific to dance sport. In addition , gender specific differences were observed both in strength levels and in tendency to shortenings. The specific requirements profile of Latin American formation dance seems to produce affects in the form of muscular imbalance on both sides of the body. These differences of muscular status<symptom> were mainly observed between dance sport competitors and non-dancers rather than between performance levels. Future investigations with higher numbers of participants would be necessary here.
