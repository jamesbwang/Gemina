 To evaluate the effect of a new-generation positional device , the sleep position trainer ( SPT) , in non-apneic position-dependent snorers. Non-apneic position-dependent snorers with an apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI) < 5 events/h were included between February 2015 and September 2016. After inclusion , study subjects used the SPT at home for 6 weeks. The Snore Outcome Survey ( SOS) was filled out by the subjects at baseline and after 6 weeks , and at the same time , the Spouse/Bed Partner Survey ( SBPS) was filled out by their bed partners. A total of 36 participants were included and 30 completed the study. SOS score improved significantly after 6 weeks from 35.0 ± 13.5 to 55.3 ± 18.6 , p < 0.001. SBPS score also improved significantly after 6 weeks from 24.7 ± 16.0 versus 54.5 ± 25.2 , p < 0.001. The severity of snoring assessed with a numeric visual analogue scale ( VAS) by the bed partner decreased significantly from a median of 8.0 with an interquartile range ( IQR) of ( 7.0-8.5) to 7.0 ( 3.8-8.0) after 6 weeks ( p = 0.004). Results of this study indicate that positional therapy with the SPT improved several snoring-related outcome measures in non-apneic position-dependent snorers. The results of this non-controlled study demonstrate that this SPT could be considered as an alternative therapeutic option to improve sleep-related health status<symptom> of snorers and their bed partners.
