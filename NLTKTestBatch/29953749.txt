 The pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( ITP) has not been fully clarified. Anti-αvβ3 integrin autoantibody is detected in chronic ITP patients , but its contribution to ITP is still unclear. To clarify the potential role of anti-αvβ3 integrin autoantibody in chronic ITP and the related mechanism. Relationship between levels of anti-αvβ3 autoantibody and platelets in chronic ITP patients was evaluated. Influence of anti-αvβ3 antibody on megakaryocytes ( MKs) survival , differentiation , migration and adhesion was assessed , and the associated signal pathways were investigated. Platelet recovery and MKs distribution were observed in ITP mouse model pretreated with different antibodies. In this study , we showed that the anti-αvβ3 autoantibody usually coexists with anti-αIIbβ3 autoantibody in chronic ITP patients , and patients with both autoantibodies have lower platelets. In vitro studies , we showed that the anti-αvβ3 antibody had no significant effect on the survival and proliferation of MKs , while it decreased formations of proplatelet significantly. Anti-αvβ3 antibody impeded SDF-1 mediated migration and inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT. Anti-αvβ3 antibody significantly inhibited MKs adhesion to ECs and Fg. The phosphorylation of FAK and SRC induced by adhesion was inhibited when MKs were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 antibody. In vivo studies , we showed that injection with anti-α These findings demonstrate that the autoantibody against integrin α
