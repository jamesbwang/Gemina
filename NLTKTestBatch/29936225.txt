 Although traffic noise exposure is a well-known environmental pollutant whose negative health effect has been discussed in different aspects of the human life , only a few animal studies have tackled this issue as a cohort study , which is not feasible to be addressed in human studies. In addition to the deleterious impact of the daytime noise on well-being , chronic nocturnal noise can also disturb sleep and affects physical and mental health , but to date , little research has examined the neurobiological effects of light/dark cycles of traffic noise exposure. We investigated the effects of light/dark cycles and sex on the impact of chronic traffic noise exposure on mouse brain structure-function. The mice were randomly assigned to either one of two stress conditions or a control condition. Animals were exposed to traffic noise on either the light-cycle ( LC) or dark-cycle ( DC) for 30 days. Traffic noise exposure caused the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis hyperactivity , anxiety-like behavior , impairments in learning and memory , dysfunction in balance<symptom> and motor coordination<symptom> , and a reduction in variety of brain measures including a brain volume , medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC) area , cortical thickness , hippocampal volume , amygdala area , and the neural density in mPFC and dentate gyrus. All behavioral and brain measures revealed adverse effects of the chronic noise stress irrespective of the LC/DC exposure or sex. Our findings were a re-emphasis on the significance of noise prevention and mitigation strategies for public health.
