 Diabetes mellitus ( DM) reduces lung function and increases the risk of asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<disease> , pneumonia<disease><symptom> , and pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease>. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) plays a crucial role in the development of pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease>. The pathogenesis of pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> in diabetes remains unknown. We investigated the effects of hyperglycemia on EMT in the lungs of gerbils with streptozotocin ( STZ)- induced diabetes. Diabetic gerbils exhibited a significantly lower volume fraction of the alveolar airspace and significantly higher septal thickness , volume fraction of the alveolar wall , and lung injury scores than did nondiabetic gerbils. The percentage of 8-hydroxy-2 '- deoxyguanosine-positive cells and transforming growth factor-β-positive cells was significantly higher , the expression of E-cadherin was significantly lower , and the expression of N-cadherin was significantly higher in diabetic gerbils than in nondiabetic gerbils. These EMT characteristics were associated with a significant increase in α-smooth muscle actin ( SMA) expression and collagen deposition in the lungs of diabetic gerbils. The increased α-SMA expression was co-localized with surfactant protein-C in alveolar type II cells in hyperglycemic animals. In conclusion , our study demonstrates that hyperglycemia induces EMT and contributes to lung<disease> fibrosis<disease> in an experimental DM model.
