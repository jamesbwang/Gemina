 A self-assembled cluster of microdroplets levitating over a heated water surface is a fascinating phenomenon with potential applications for microreactors and for chemical and biological analysis of small volumes of liquids. Recently , we suggested a method to synthesize a cluster with an arbitrary number of small monodisperse droplets. However , the interactions , which control the structure of the cluster , are still not well understood. Here we propose a Langevin computational model considering the aerodynamic forces between the droplets and random diffusion-like fluctuations<symptom>. Characteristic length and time scales and scaling relationships of interactions are discussed. The model shows excellent agreement with experimental observations for a small number of droplets.
