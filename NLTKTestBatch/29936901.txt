 Lung cancer represents the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. While the prognosis remains poor , immunotherapy is giving a positive impact on survival. Cancer vaccines represent a form of active immunotherapy that historically has given modest results in terms of efficacy. The overexpression of the EGFR by tumor cells was reported in more than half of cases of lung cancer , representing a mechanism of cancerogenesis. CIMAvax-EGF , a therapeutic vaccine for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) developed in Cuba , consists of a human recombinant EGF able to induce antibodies against the autologous EGF , resulting in serum EGF withdrawal<symptom> and lower EGF-EGFR interaction. Area covered: We critically reviewed the existing literature about CIMAvax-EGF , from the Pilot studies to the efficacy controlled studies. We also overviewed the ongoing trials. Expert opinion: CIMAvax-EGF demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic. In a phase III randomized study CIMAvax-EGF , used as a switch maintenance treatment after platinum-based chemotherapy , did not significantly improve survival. Current data are not sufficient to recommend CIMAvax-EGF as a treatment option for advanced stage NSCLC. Further studies , conducted in a context of worldwide standardized clinical practice , are needed to better define if a subpopulation of patients can benefit from the vaccination.
