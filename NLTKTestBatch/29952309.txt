 Insomnia often coexists with depression<symptom> , and there is compelling evidence for a genetic component in the etiologies of both disorders. We genotyped an exonic variant , rs4290270 , in tryptophan hydroxylase-2 ( TPH-2) gene to investigate its association with primary insomnia in Han Chinese , and further with depression<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in patients with primary insomnia. Retrospective cross-sectional study. This study included 152 patients with primary insomnia and 164 age- and gender-matched normal controls. Neuropsychological tests were performed. The genotype distributions of TPH-2 gene rs4290270 met the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both patients and controls ( P > 0.05). The allele and genotype distributions of this variant were comparable between patients and controls in all subjects and by genders ( all P > 0.05). The impact of rs4290270 on SDS score changes was statistically significant ( P = 0.002) , with carriers of A/A genotype having the highest self-rating depression<symptom> scale ( SDS) score ( mean ± standard deviation: 52.73 ± 12.88) , followed by A/T genotype ( 50.94 ± 11.29 , P = 0.35) and T/T genotype ( 43.48 ± 7.78 , P < 0.01) , and this impact was more obvious in women ( P < 0.001). Our findings indicate that TPH-2 gene rs4290270 may not be a susceptibility locus for primary insomnia in Han Chinese , but may be a marker of depressive symptoms<symptom> , especially SDS score , in patients with primary insomnia.
