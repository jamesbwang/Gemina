 This study explored the feasibility of intraparenchymal delivery ( Gadoteridol and/or AAV5-GFP) into the cerebellum of nonhuman primates using real-time MRI-guided CED technology. All animals tolerated the neurosurgical procedure without any clinical sequela. Gene expression was detected within the cerebellar parenchyma at the site of infusion and resulted in transduction of neuronal cell bodies and fibers. Histopathology indicated localized damage along the stem of the cannula tract<symptom>. These findings demonstrate the potential of real-time MRI-guided CED to deliver therapeutics into the cerebellum , which has extensive reciprocal connections and may be used as a target for the treatment of neurological disorders.
