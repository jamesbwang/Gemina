 Ionic liquids ( ILs) have generated considerable attention recently because of their cytotoxicity and application as antibiotics. However , the mechanism of how they damage cell membranes<symptom> is not currently well understood. In this paper , the antibacterial activities of two imidazolium-based ILs , namely 1-butyl- 3-methylimidazolium tetrafluroborate ( ( BMIM) ( BF4)) and 1-ethyl- 3-methylimidazolium tetrafluroborate ( ( EMIM) ( BF4)) have been investigated. The activity of ( BMIM) ( BF4) on gram negative bacteria<pathogen> E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> is observed to be stronger compared with the short chained ( EMIM) ( BF4). To explain this observation , the effects of these ILs on the self-assembled structures of model cellular membranes<symptom> have been investigated. The in-plane elasticity of a monolayer formed at air-water interface by 1,2-dipalmitoyl- sn-glycero- 3-phosphocholine ( DPPC) lipids was reduced in the presence of the ILs. The x-ray reflectivity studies on polymer supported lipid bilayer have shown the bilayer to shrink and correspondingly exhibit an increase in electron density. The presence of a certain mol % of negatively charged lipid , 1,2-dipalmitoyl-rac-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine ( DPPS) , in DPPC mono- and bi-layers enhances the effect considerably.
