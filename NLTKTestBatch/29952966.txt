 The purpose of our study was to determine accuracy of CT texture analysis ( CTTA) for differentiating benign from malignant pulmonary nodules<disease> , and well-differentiated from poorly differentiated lung cancers , with histology as the standard of reference.In this IRB-approved study , 175 adult patients ( average age 66 Â± 12 years; age range 27-89 years , male 82: female 93) who underwent a noncontrast chest CT examination prior to CT-guided biopsy of pulmonary nodules<disease> were included. There were 57 benign ( 24 tumors or tumor-like lesions<symptom>; 33 inflammatory conditions) and 120 malignant ( 29 well-differentiated adenocarcinomas , 48 poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas , and 43 squamous cell carcinomas) diagnoses on pathology. CTTA was performed on the prebiopsy noncontrast CT images using a commercially available software ( TexRAD limited , UK). The CTCA features analyzed included mean HU values , percent positive pixels ( PPP) , mean value of positive pixels ( MPP) , standard deviation ( SD) , normalized SD , skewness , kurtosis , and entropy.The ROC analyses showed that normalized SD ( AUC: 0.63 , ( CI: 0.55-72) , P = .003) had moderate accuracy for differentiating between benign and malignant lesions<symptom>. For differentiating among well-differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors , the ROC analysis showed that except skewness all other parameters were statistically significant The AUC values of other CTTA parameters were: mean ( AUC: 0.73-0.76 , P = .001- < .0001). CT texture analyses can reliably predict well- and poorly differentiated lung malignancies. However , inflammatory lung lesions<symptom> with tissue heterogeneity negatively affect the performance of CTTA when it comes to differentiation between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules<disease>.
