 Consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners ( NNS) is a dietary practice used by those who wish to lose weight<symptom> or by patients on a sugar-restricted diet such as those with DM2. Although these substances are safe , possible biological interactions with the digestive tract<symptom> , particularly in relation to intestinal permeability , have not been studied. Thus , the current work sought to investigate the action of different NNS on intestinal permeability using an in vitro Caco-2 cell model. Caco-2 cells were incubated with acesulfame K , aspartame , saccharin , or sucralose at equimolar concentrations. Acesulfame K , aspartame , and sucralose did not disrupt monolayer integrity in the cells. However , saccharin increased paracellular permeability and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER) via a non-cytotoxic mechanism. The levels of the tight junction protein claudin-1 were reduced in Caco-2 cells that had previously been exposed to saccharin. The inhibition of nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) was able to prevent the reduction in TEER induced by saccharin treatment. Thalidomide , as an inhibitor of ubiquitin ligase , was able to prevent the decrease in claudin-1 protein expression and the TEER reduction in Caco-2 cells. Saccharin disrupts monolayer integrity and alters paracellular permeability in a Caco-2 cell monolayer model , via a mechanism involving NF-κB activation , resulting in the ubiquitination of the tight junction protein claudin-1. Saccharin consumption may potentially alter the intestinal integrity in humans.
