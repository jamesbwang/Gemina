 Genomic imprinting is a conspicuous feature of the endosperm , a triploid tissue nurturing the embryo and synchronizing angiosperm seed development. An unknown subset of imprinted genes ( IGs) is critical for successful seed development and should have highly conserved functions. Recent genome-wide studies have found limited conservation of IGs among distantly related species , but there is a paucity of data from closely related lineages. Moreover , most studies focused on model plants with nuclear endosperm development , and comparisons with properties of IGs in cellular-type endosperm development are lacking. Using laser-assisted microdissection , we characterized parent-specific expression in the cellular endosperm of three wild tomato lineages ( Solanum section Lycopersicon). We identified 1,025 candidate IGs and 167 with putative homologs previously identified as imprinted in distantly related taxa with nuclear-type endosperm. Forty-two maternally expressed genes ( MEGs) and 17 paternally expressed genes ( PEGs) exhibited conserved imprinting status<symptom> across all three lineages , but differences in power to assess imprinted expression imply that the actual degree of conservation might be higher than that directly estimated ( 20.7 % for PEGs and 10.4 % for MEGs). Regardless , the level of shared imprinting status<symptom> was higher for PEGs than for MEGs , indicating dissimilar evolutionary trajectories. Expression-level data suggest distinct epigenetic modulation of MEGs and PEGs , and gene ontology analyses revealed MEGs and PEGs to be enriched for different functions. Importantly , our data provide evidence that MEGs and PEGs interact in modulating both gene expression and the endosperm cell cycle , and uncovered conserved cellular functions of IGs uniting taxa with cellular- and nuclear-type endosperm.
