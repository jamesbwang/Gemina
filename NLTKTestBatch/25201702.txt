 Elucidate temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) development and pathophysiology relative to regeneration , degeneration , and adaption. The pharyngeal arch produces a highly conserved stomatognathic system that supports airway and masticatory function. An induced subperiosteal layer of fibrocartilage cushions TMJ functional and parafunctional loads. If the fibrocartilage disc is present , a fractured mandibular condyle ( MC) regenerates near the eminence of the fossa via a blastema emanating from the medial periosteal surface of the ramus. TMJ degenerative joint disease<disease> ( DJD) is a relatively painless osteoarthrosis , resulting in extensive sclerosis , disc destruction , and lytic lesions<symptom>. Facial form and symmetry may be affected , but the residual bone is vital because distraction continues to lengthen the MC with anabolic bone modeling. Extensive TMJ adaptive , healing , and regenerative potential maintains optimal , life support functions over a lifetime. Unique aspects of TMJ development , function , and pathophysiology may be useful for innovative management of other joints.
