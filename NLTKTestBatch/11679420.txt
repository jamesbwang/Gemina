 Although obesity affects approximately one in five youths , only a fraction is treated in pediatric weight<symptom> management clinics. Characteristics distinguishing youth with obesity who seek weight<symptom> management treatment from those who do not are largely unknown. Yet identification of specific health characteristics which differentiate treatment-seeking from non-treatment seeking youth with obesity may shed light on underlying motivations for pursuing treatment. Compare the cardiometabolic profiles of an obesity treatment-seeking sample of youth to a population-based sample of youth with obesity , while controlling for body mass index ( BMI). This cross-sectional study included participants , ages 12-17 years , with obesity from the Pediatric Obesity and Weight<symptom> Evaluation Registry ( POWER) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , representing the treatment-seeking and population samples , respectively. Mean differences were calculated for systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> percentiles , total cholesterol , low-density and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol , triglycerides , fasting glucose , glycated hemoglobin and alanine aminotransferase , while adjusting for age , sex , race/ethnicity , insurance status<symptom> , and multiple of the 95th BMI percentile. The POWER and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cohorts included 1,823 and 617 participants , respectively. The POWER cohort had higher systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> percentile ( mean difference 17.4 , 95 % confidence interval ( 14.6 , 20.1) , p < 0.001) , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> percentile ( 21.8 ( 19 , 24.5) , p < 0.001) , triglycerides ( 42.3 ( 28 , 56.5) , p < 0.001) and alanine aminotransferase ( 7.5 ( 5.1 , 9.8) , p < 0.001) and lower fasting glucose ( -6.9 ( -8.2 , -5.6) , p < 0.001) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( -2.3 ( -3.8 , -0.9) , p < 0.002). There were no differences in total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or clinical differences in glycated hemoglobin. For a given BMI , obesity treatment-seeking youth are more adversely affected by cardiometabolic risk factors than the general population of youth with obesity. This suggests that treatment-seeking youth may represent a distinct group that is at particularly high risk for the development of future cardiometabolic disease<disease>.
