 Uterine serous carcinoma ( USC) is a rare but aggressive subtype of endometrial carcinoma. Large-scale comprehensive efforts have resulted in an improved molecular understanding of its pathogenesis , and the p53 pathway has been proposed as a key player and is potentially targetable. Here we attempt to further portray the p53 pathway in USC by assessing p53 isoform expression. We applied quantitative Real-Time PCRs ( RT-qPCR) for expression analyses of total p53 mRNA as well as quantitative distinction of p53β , p53γ , and the total mRNA of amino-terminal truncated Δ40p53 and Δ133p53 in a retrospective cohort of 37 patients with USC. TP53 mutation status<symptom> was assessed by targeted massive parallel sequencing. Findings were correlated with clinical data. The p53 isoform expression landscape in USCs was heterogeneous and dominated by total Δ133p53 , while the distinct p53β and p53γ variants were found at much lower levels. The isoform expression profiles varied between samples , while their expression was independent of TP53 mutation status<symptom>. We found high relative p53γ expression to be associated with reduced progression-free survival ( PFS). This is the first indication that elevated p53γ expression is associated with reduced PFS in USC. This single-center study may offer some insight in the landscape of p53 isoform expression in USC , but further validation studies are crucial to understand the context-dependent and tissue-specific role of the p53 isoform network in gynecological cancer.
