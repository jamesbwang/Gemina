 Depression<symptom> is one of the most important health problems worldwide. Women are 2.5 times more likely to experience major depression<symptom> than men. Evidence suggests that some women might experience an increased risk for developing depression<symptom> during & ldquo; windows of vulnerability & rdquo; , i.e. , when exposed to intense hormone fluctuations<symptom> , such as the menopause transition. Indeed , this period is associated with different symptoms<symptom> , including vasomotor , depressive , and cognitive symptoms<symptom> , which have all been shown to worsen as women approach menopause. Even though hormonal therapy represents the most effective treatment , side effects have been reported by several studies. Therefore , an increased number of women might prefer the use of alternative medicine for treating menopausal symptoms<symptom>. N-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-3 LCPUFAs) are included among these alternative treatments. We here provide a review of studies investigating the effects of n-3 LCPUFAs on hot flashes and depressive and cognitive disorders in menopausal women. The reported results are scattered and heterogeneous. In conclusion , a beneficial role of n-3 LCPUFAs in hot flashes , and depressive and cognitive symptoms<symptom> related to menopausal transition is still far from conclusive.
