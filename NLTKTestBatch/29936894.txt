 Progeroid syndromes<symptom> induced by mutations in lamin A or in its interactors- named progeroid laminopathies- are model systems for the dissection of the molecular pathways causing physiological and premature aging. A large amount of data , based mainly on the Hutchinson Gilford Progeria syndrome<symptom> ( HGPS) , one of the best characterized progeroid laminopathy , has highlighted the role of lamins in multiple DNA activities , including replication , repair , chromatin organization and telomere function. On the other hand , the phenotypes generated by mutations affecting genes directly acting on DNA function , as mutations in the helicases WRN and BLM or in the polymerase polÎ´ , share many of the traits of progeroid laminopathies. These evidences support the hypothesis of a concerted implication of DNA function and lamins in aging. We focus here on these aspects to contribute to the comprehension of the driving forces acting in progeroid syndromes<symptom> and premature aging.
