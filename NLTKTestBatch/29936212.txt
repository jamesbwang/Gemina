 Giant ruptured paraclinoid aneurysm<disease> with concomitant bilateral internal carotid artery dissection ( CAD) could be a very difficult condition to be treated with the current surgical and endovascular techniques. Paraclinoid internal carotid artery ( ICA) aneurysms<disease> remain a major challenge for vascular neurosurgeons. There are still controversies in the management of carotid artery dissections. Surgical and endovascular treatment is recommended in cases with multi-vessel dissections or those complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH). We report a case of a 35-year-old woman presenting with clinical manifestations and tomographic findings compatible with SAH , due to rupture of a paraclinoid aneurysm<disease> in the left ICA. We had to treat the ruptured aneurysm<disease> and the concurrent dissection of both internal carotid arteries. The patient underwent high flow extracranial-intracranial ( EC-IC) arterial graft bypass and subsequent trapping of the left ICA. Complete aneurysm<disease> exclusion from the cerebral circulation was achieved and the possible embolic events from the left side were prevented. The concomitant right<symptom> internal CAD was treated conservatively with anticoagulants and antiplatelets. Dealing only with the ruptured paraclinoid aneurysm<disease> , without taking care of the underlying cerebral ischemia due to concomitant extracranial ICA dissection could be an insufficient approach for treatment. In the presented case of a giant ruptured paraclinoid aneurysm<disease> and coexistence of severe bilateral ICA dissecting stenosis , trapping with matching the bypass flow , was the proper solution for managing simultaneously with the aneurysm<disease> and the cerebral ischemia from the left side. Anticoagulants and antiplatelets were safely applied to treat the right internal CAD.
