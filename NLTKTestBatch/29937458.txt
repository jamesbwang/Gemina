 This study reports two clinical cases of avian haemosporidian infection caused by a Haemoproteus sp. , involving a snowy owl ( Bubo<symptom> scandiacus) and a goshawk ( Accipiter gentilis) , at a zoo. The snowy owl died after presenting with anorexia<symptom> , depression<symptom> and lethargy<symptom>. A blood smear with Wright 's staining confirmed Haemoproteus infection. Necropsy<disease> of the snowy owl revealed hypertrophy of the internal organs , including the liver , gallbladder , kidney and adrenal glands. The goshawk showed anorexia<symptom> , depression<symptom> and a lowered head<disease> position , and was diagnosed with a Haemoproteus infection based on a blood smear. The goshawk was completely cured by treatment with a combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. Both cases showed decreased erythrocytes , hemoglobin and hematocrit values on complete blood count.
