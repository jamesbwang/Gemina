 Loren ( Larry) H. Parsons passed away at the age of 51. In spite of his premature departure , Larry much contributed to the drug abuse field. Since his graduate studies for the Ph.D. in Chemistry in J.B. Justice lab , microdialysis is the tread that links Larry 's research topics , namely , the role of dopamine ( DA) , serotonin ( 5-HT) , gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) , glutamate and endocannabinoids ( eCBs) in drug reinforcement and dependence. Larry was the first to show that abstinence from chronic cocaine reduces extracellular DA in the NAc , consistent with the so called ` dopamine depletion hypothesis ' of cocaine addiction. Another Larry 's major contributions are the studies on 5-HT and 5-HT receptors ' role in cocaine stimulant actions , which resulted in the identification of 5-HT1B receptors as a critical substrate of cocaine reinforcement. By applying mass spectrometry to eCBs analysis in brain dialysates , Larry 's lab showed that ethanol , heroin , nicotine and cocaine differentially affect anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglicerol overflow in the NAc shell , a critical site of drugs of abuse DA stimulant actions. Larry also applied microdialysis to study GABA and glutamate 's role in ethanol dependence and heroin reinforcement , providing in vivo evidence for a sensitization of corticotropin-releasing factor-dependent release of GABA in the central amygdala in withdrawal<symptom> from chronic ethanol and for a reduction of GABA transmission in the ventral pallidum<pathogen> in heroin but not cocaine intravenous self-administration. Larry showed the wide possibilities of microdialysis as a general purpose methodology for monitoring neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the brain extracellular compartment. From this viewpoint , he stands as the best advocate for microdialysis.
