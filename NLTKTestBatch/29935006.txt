 One of the main problems of the remote complex sample analysis instrumentation is that such systems are susceptible to temperature fluctuations<symptom>. Temperature regulation is energetically ineffective , and it is not used in most of the field portable analytical systems. Separations performed in a changing temperature environment provide electropherograms with considerable baseline fluctuations<symptom> , resulting in significant errors in detection and integration of the peaks. This paper describes electropherogram baseline compensation that is suitable for the capillary electrophoresis-contactless conductivity detection analytical method. The baseline compensation utilizes linear or polynomial data processing methods , and can be programmed in-line using simple microcontroller , or on-line and off-line in data acquisition software. This method is targeted for field portable and autonomous analytical systems that are utilized in a fluctuating environment.
