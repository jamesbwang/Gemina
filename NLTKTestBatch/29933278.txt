 In soccer , unintentional and intentional ( heading) head<disease> impacts are associated with concussive symptoms<symptom> and cognitive dysfunction. We examined whether personality traits were associated with these behaviors in soccer players. Cross-sectional study. Participants completed study visits at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. A total of 307 adult amateur soccer players , recruited from New<pathogen> York City and the surrounding area , completed 737 HeadCount-2w questionnaires. Personality traits ( intellect/imagination , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism) were assessed with the Mini-International Personality Item Pool questionnaire at the baseline study visit. Participants completed an online questionnaire ( HeadCount-2w) to ascertain frequency of intentional head<disease> impacts and occurrence of unintentional head<disease> impacts every 3 to 6 months. Generalized estimating equations repeated-measures regressions determined whether personality predicted unintentional and intentional impacts. Personality traits were not associated with unintentional head<disease> impact ( s) or frequency of intentional head<disease> impacts. These findings have important clinical implications , suggesting that personality is not driving the association between high levels of unintentional and intentional head<disease> impacts and worse neuropsychological functioning and concussive symptoms<symptom>.
