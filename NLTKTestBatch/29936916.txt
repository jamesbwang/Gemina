 Vitamin D deficiency ( serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 25 nmol/l) is extremely common in Western-dwelling South Asians but evidence regarding vitamin D supplement usage in this group is very limited. This work identifies demographic , dietary and lifestyle predictors associated with vitamin D supplement use. Cross-sectional analysis of baseline vitamin D supplement use data. UK Biobank cohort. In total , 8024 South Asians ( Bangladeshi , Indian<disease> , Pakistani) , aged 40-69 years. Twenty-three per cent of men and 39 % of women ( P < 0 · 001) ( 22 % of Bangladeshis , 32 % of Indians , 25 % of Pakistanis ( P < 0 · 001)) took a vitamin-D-containing supplement. Median vitamin D intakes from diet were low at 1 · 0-3 · 0 µg/d , being highest in Bangladeshis and lowest in Indians ( P < 0 · 001). Logistic regression modelling showed that females had a higher odds of vitamin D supplement use than males ( OR = 2 · 02; 95 % CI 1 · 79 , 2 · 28). A lower supplement usage was seen in younger persons ( 40-60 years v. > 60 years: OR = 0 · 75; 95 % CI 0 · 65 , 0 · 86) and in those living outside Greater London ( OR = 0 · 53 to 0 · 77) , with borderline trends for a lower BMI , higher oily fish intake and higher household income associated with increased odds of vitamin D supplement use. Vitamin D supplements were not used by most South Asians and intakes from diet alone are likely to be insufficient to maintain adequate vitamin D status<symptom>. Public health strategies are now urgently required to promote the use of vitamin D supplements in these specific UK South Asian subgroups.
