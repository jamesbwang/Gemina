 With the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> there is a pressing need for new oral drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Herein , we describe the identification of a novel morpholino-thiophenes ( MOT) series following phenotypic screening of the Eli Lilly corporate library against M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> strain H37Rv<pathogen>. The design , synthesis and structure activity relationships of a range of analogs around the confirmed actives are described. Optimised leads with potent whole cell activity against H37Rv<pathogen> , no cytotoxicity flags and in vivo efficacy in an acute murine model of infection<disease> are described. Mode-of-action studies suggest that the novel scaffold targets QcrB , a subunit of the menaquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase , part of the bc1-aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase complex that is responsible for driving oxygen-dependent respiration<symptom>.
