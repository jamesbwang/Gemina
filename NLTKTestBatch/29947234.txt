 We want to investigate the protective effects of apelin-13 on myocardial ischemia reperfusion ( I/R) injury. 30 Wistar Albino rat were divided into 5 groups ( n: 6) , namely control group ( C) , diabetes group ( D) , diabetes + apelin-13 group ( DA) , diabetes + I/R group ( DIR) and diabetes I/R + apelin-13 group ( DIR-A). Rats were subjected to 30‑min ischemia and 90‑min reperfusion. Biochemical and histopathological parameters were measured. Caspase-3 enzyme activity was significantly higher in the DIR group than in the C , DA , and DIR-A groups. The intensity of caspase 3 enzyme activity was significantly higher in the I/R group than in all other groups. Inflammation and vascular dilatation were found significantly higher in the DIR group than in all other groups. Congestion<symptom> was significantly higher in the DIR group than in the C and D groups. TOS enzyme activity was significantly higher in the DIR group than in the C , DA and DIR-A groups. TAS enzyme activity was significantly lower in the DIR group than in the C and DIR-A groups. We believe that the protective effects of apelin-13 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and its use indications can be demonstrated in detail as long as the findings we have reached in our study are supported by other studies ( Tab. 2 , Fig. 10 , Ref. 43).
