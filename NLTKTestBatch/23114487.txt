 Rubber projectiles are used as an alternative to metal bullets owing to their lower morbidity and mortality rate. There are few reports of vascular lesions<symptom> of extremities caused by rubber projectiles in the literature. The authors report the case of a 37-year-old man who was the victim of a penetrating injury to the left thigh with a rubber projectile. He reported only pain at the site of the injury; pulses<symptom> were decreased in the affected limb. After arteriography confirmed an injury to the superficial femoral artery , he underwent an arterial and venous femorofemoral bypass using a reversed contralateral saphenous vein.
