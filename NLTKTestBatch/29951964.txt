 Autoinflammatory diseases<disease> ( AIDs) are a recently described group of conditions caused by mutations in multiple genes that code for proteins of the innate immune system. Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes<symptom> ( CAPS) are autoinflammatory diseases<disease> comprising three clinically overlapping disorders: familial cold urticarial syndrome<symptom> ( FCAS) , Muckle-Wells syndrome<symptom> ( MWS) , and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> ( NOMID). CAPS have been associated with gain-of-function variations in NLRP3 ( NOD-like receptor family , pyrin containing domain-3). However , a new class of autoinflammatory disease<disease> resembling FCAS or MWS has been described in patients with NLRP12 mutations. Here , we report a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with AID who developed an unexpected C3 glomerulopathy during attacks and carried a novel variation in NLRP12. Following treatment with IL ( interleukin) 1 targeting agents , all symptoms<symptom> and inflammation resolved. This is the first case in the literature affected by both autoinflammatory disease<disease> and C3 glomerulopathy.
