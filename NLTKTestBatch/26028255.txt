 Immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis<disease> is a rare complication with incidence estimated around 3 %. This disease<disease> is difficult to diagnose and has great morbidity. For this reason , it became a challenge for oncologists and emergencists. We reviewed the case of five patients who used anti-PD1 ( program cell death receptor antagonist 1) for antineoplastic treatment and developed treatment-induced pneumonitis<disease>. All patients had respiratory problems because of immunotherapy and presence of ground-glass radiologic change. Among all patients , only one had grade 5 pneumonitis<disease> , and delaying to begin corticosteroid therapy and worsening in clinical picture led to patient death. Other four patients with symptomatic grade 2 pneumonitis<disease> underwent corticosteroid therapy and had improvement in clinical and radiologic picture. Two patients were treated after an episode of pneumonitis<disease> , and no new pulmonary complications were observed until the end of this study. Immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis<disease> , although uncommon , can be potentially fatal. Medical team has the responsibility to pay attention for most common symptoms<symptom> of the disease<disease> such as cough<symptom> and dyspnea<symptom> and conduct an early diagnosis and effective early treatment with corticosteroids.
