 Gains and losses<symptom> in ecosystem service values ( ESV) in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province during rapid urbanization were analyzed in terms of land-use changes. Decision-making on coastal development based on ESV estimation is significant for the sustainable utilization of coastal resource. In this study , coastal land-use changes in Zhejiang Province during rapid urbanization were discussed based on remote-sensing derived land-use maps created in the years 1990 , 2000 and 2010. The ESV changes in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province from 1990 to 2010 were estimated by using the established ESV estimation model. The analysis results demonstrate the following: ( 1) with the continuous acceleration of urbanization , land-use types in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province changed significantly from 1990 to 2010 , demonstrated by considerable growth of urban construction land and reduction of forest<disease> land and farmland; ( 2) in the study period , the total ESV in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province continuously decreased in value from RMB 35.278 billion to 29.964 billion , a reduction of 15.06 %; ( 3) in terms of the spatial distribution of ESV , the ESVs in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province were generally converted from a higher ESV to a lower ESV; ( 4) estimates of ESV for the three years 1990 , 2000 and 2010 appear to be relatively stable; and ( 5) land-use intensity in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province continuously increased during the 20 years. The spatial distribution of land-use intensity was consistent with that of the ESV change rate. Disordered land-use changes from forestland and farmland to urban construction land was a major cause of ESV loss.
