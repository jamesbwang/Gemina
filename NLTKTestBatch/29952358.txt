 The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the prognostic impact of renal dysfunction ( RD) at admission in patients with preserved , moderately impaired and severely impaired left ventricular systolic function following ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI). We included 2436 patients with STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pPCI). Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock<symptom> and those on hemodyalisis were excluded. According to the left ventricular ejection fraction ( EF) , patients were divided in three groups: preserved left ventricular systolic function- EF > 50 % , moderately impaired- EF = 40 % -50 % and severely impaired left ventricular systolic function-EF < 40 %. RD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1 .73 m2 at admission. The follow-up period was 6 years. Preserved , moderately impaired and severely impaired systolic function were found in 741 ( 30.5 %) , 1367 ( 56.1 %) and 328 ( 13.4 %) patients , respectively. RD was present in 105 ( 14.2 %) patients with preserved systolic function , 247 ( 18.1 %) patients with moderately impaired , and 120 ( 36.5 %) patients with severely impaired systolic function.Regardless of the presence of RD , 6-year mortality rates in patients with preserved , moderately impaired , and severely impaired systolic function were 2.7 % , 5.2 % and 31.1 % respectively. Within each LVEF group , patients with RD had a worse outcome , both in the short- and long-term. In the Mulivariate Cox Analysis , RD remained an independent predictor of 6-year mortality in patients with moderately ( HR 2.52 , 95 % CI 1.54-3.78) and severely impaired systolic function ( HR 2.84 , 95 % CI 1.68-5.34) , but not in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function ( HR 0.59 , 95 % CI 0.14-1.41). Although patients with RD had higher 6-year mortallity following STEMI regardless of LVEF , RD at admission remained a strong independent predictor for 6-year mortality only in patients with moderately and severely impaired left ventricular systolic function.
