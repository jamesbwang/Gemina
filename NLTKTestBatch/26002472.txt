 Understanding intraspecific relationships between genetic and functional diversity is a major goal in the field of evolutionary biology and is important for conserving biodiversity. Linking intraspecific molecular patterns of plants to ecological pressures<symptom> and trait variation remains difficult due to environment-driven plasticity. Next-generation sequencing , untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS) profiling , and interdisciplinary approaches integrating population genomics , metabolomics , and community ecology permit novel strategies to tackle this problem. We analyzed six natural populations of the disease-threatened
