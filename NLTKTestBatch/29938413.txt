 Cleft lip and<symptom> palate<symptom> is a relatively common condition presenting a considerable technical challenge , especially the wide cleft ( > 8 mm) , for the surgeons. Pre-surgical orthodontics , which reduces the cleft width and facilitates definitive repair , is expensive and not universally available , especially in the third world. Lip adhesion could be a cheaper alternative to pre-surgical orthodontics. This six-year prospective observational study , from 2010 to 2016 , was conducted at the paediatric surgical units of PNS Shifa Hospital , Karachi and Military Hospital Rawalpindi. All children with wide ( 8 mm or more gap in the alveolus) complete ULCP ( unilateral cleft lip and<symptom> palate<symptom>) were included in the study. Lip adhesion with concomitant vomer flap palatal repair was followed by definitive lip repair once the desired moulding , i.e. , alveolar gap < 5 mm or adequate narrowing as per surgeon 's subjective assessment during the 3 and 6 monthly follow up , had been achieved. A total of 53 children with the mean age 4.5 ± 1.5 months were subjected to surgery , 32 ( 60.4 %) were males and 21 ( 39.6 %) were females. The mean gap in the cleft alveolus was 11.1 ± 1.7 mm , which was reduced to a mean of 3.2 ± 1.3 mm , after a follow up of 4.3 ± 1.1 months. The outcome of the lip repair , based on parental satisfaction , was excellent in 41 ( 77.3 %) , good in 10 ( 18.9 %) and poor in 2 ( 3.8 %) cases. Lip adhesion is a safe and effective substitute for pre-surgical orthodontics in wide ULCP.
