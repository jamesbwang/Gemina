 Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) are ineligible for clinical trials. However , few studies have reported on the profiles and treatment outcomes for these patients. Therefore , we investigated the characteristics , outcomes , and survival of patients with advanced NSCLC who were ineligible for clinical trials. We analyzed the data from a retrospective cohort of 786 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC. We reviewed the criteria of phase 1 to 3 clinical trials and classified patients according to the common first-line eligibility criteria for lung cancer. Of the 786 patients , 469 ( 60 %) were ineligible for clinical trials. The main reasons for ineligibility were brain metastasis ( 41 %) , poor performance status<symptom> ( 25 %) , and respiratory<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> ( 24 %). For all patients , ineligibility was identified as an independent predictor of overall survival ( hazard ratio , 0.78; 95.0 % confidence interval , 0.65-0.93; P = .008) , even in those with a good performance status<symptom> who had received chemotherapy ( hazard ratio , 0.80; 95.0 % confidence interval , 0.65-0.99; P = .037). In the subgroup analysis of ineligible patients , survival varied depending on the reasons for ineligibility. In particular , a history of cancer was not associated with a poor outcome , although this was a common reason for ineligibility. Most patients were ineligible for clinical trials and had a shorter overall survival , although this varied depending on the reason for their ineligibility. These results should be considered when applying clinical trial outcomes to real-world patients. Further studies of ineligible patients are needed to improve the treatment decisions in clinical settings.
