 Although brief alcohol interventions ( BAIs) that incorporate personalized feedback demonstrate efficacy for reducing the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption in veteran samples , little research has explored the influence of BAIs in reducing symptoms<symptom> of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD). The goal of this investigation was to understand whether PTSD symptom<symptom> severity and diagnostic status changed after exposure to an intervention that targeted alcohol misuse and integrated feedback on PTSD. Sixty-eight combat veterans ( 8.8 % female; 27.9 % African American) who screened positive for hazardous drinking were recruited from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Participants received a 1-session brief intervention that primarily targeted alcohol misuse but also included personalized feedback and psychoeducation on PTSD symptoms<symptom> and coping. Participants were randomized to receive personalized written feedback either with or without a motivational interview. A mixed-model repeated measures analysis revealed that PTSD symptom<symptom> severity was significantly lower at the 6-week ( M = 41.47 , SD = 28.94) and 6-month ( M = 35.56 SD = 26.99) follow-up appointments relative to baseline ( M = 51.22 , SD = 26.67) , F ( 2 , 127.24) = 38.32 , p < .001. Regression analyses demonstrate that the percent change in alcohol use was related to the change in PTSD severity. Further , results indicated that a motivational-interviewing-style counseling session accompanying the feedback was not significantly more efficacious than receiving feedback only. A brief alcohol intervention that integrates information on PTSD has the potential to reduce PTSD severity. Personalized alcohol and PTSD feedback may be useful as an opportunistic intervention for OEF/OIF veterans. ( PsycINFO Database Record
