 The mechanisms by which varicocele affects fertility remain undetermined. Vitamin A ( all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA)) is required for fertility and normal spermatogenesis; however , the mechanisms driving its action are not defined yet. Previously , we demonstrated in varicocele sperm a reduced RARÎ± expression and that ATRA influence sperm performance. To further define vitamin A significance in male gamete and in the physiopathology of varicocele , we tested for the first time ATRA action on human sperm metabolism and antioxidant defense systems. Evaluating triglycerides content and lipase activity , in normal sperm ATRA had a lipid lowering effect , which was not observed in varicocele sperm. The modulation of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity , concomitantly with a reduction of the glucose content , highlight an ATRA role on glucose metabolism. ATRA induced the superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and glutathione transferase activities , while it reduced the malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production both in healthy and varicocele sperm. Interestingly , SOD1 and SOD2 have been localized in the acrosome and midpiece , glutathione- S-transferase omega 2 ( GSTO2) in the acrosome , equatorial , and subacrosomial regions. SOD1 , SOD2 , and GSTO2 levels were significantly lower in varicocele with respect to healthy sperm. Herein , we discovered that ATRA treatment was able to reprogram sperm metabolism toward that of the capacitation status<symptom>. The retinol protected human sperm from ROS damage enhancing the antioxidant enzymes activity , providing evidence toward the efficacy of vitamin A as therapeutic tool in improving sperm quality. These novel findings further confirm the importance of vitamin A in male fertility adding new insights into the retinoids complex biological framework.
