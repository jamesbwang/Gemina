 Data regarding the pre-treatment inter-tumor heterogeneity of potential biomarkers in advanced-stage lung cancers is limited. A finding of such heterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesions<symptom> would prove valuable to determine if a metastatic lesion<symptom> can be a surrogate for the primary tumor , as more biomarkers will likely be used in the future to inform treatment decisions. We performed RNA sequencing to analyze inter-tumor heterogeneity in thirty specimens ( primary tumors , intra-thoracic , and extra-thoracic metastatic lesions<symptom>) obtained from five treatment-na√Øve lung cancer patients. The global unsupervised clustering analysis showed that the lesions<symptom> clustered at the individual patient level , rather than on the metastatic sites , suggesting that the characteristics of specific tumor cells have a greater impact on the gene expression signature than the microenvironment in which the metastasis develops. While , the mutational and transcriptional data highlight the presence of inter-tumor heterogeneity , showing that the primary tumors are usually distinct from metastatic lesions<symptom>. Through a comparison between metastatic lesions<symptom> and the primary tumors , we observed that pathways related to cell proliferation were upregulated , while immune-related pathways were downregulated in metastatic lesions<symptom>. These data not only provide insight into the evolution of lung cancers , but also imply possibilities and limitations of biomarker-based treatment in lung cancers.
