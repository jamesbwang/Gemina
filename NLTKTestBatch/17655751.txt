 Subcutaneous<disease> Sweet 's syndrome<symptom> ( SSS) is a rare variant of Sweet 's syndrome<symptom> ( SS) , clinically characterized by erythematous plaques or nodules<disease> with a histologic pattern demonstrating a neutrophilic panniculitis ( NP). We report a case of a 74-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome<symptom> ( MDS) who presented with persistent fever<symptom> , malaise<symptom> , and non-resolving generalized erythematous nodules<disease> and was found to have an MDS-related SSS. SSS should be entertained and other causes of NP should be excluded prior to treating a patient with systemic corticosteroids. Early diagnosis of SSS in a patient not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial as it helps to minimize unnecessary prolonged antibiotics exposure in this era of antimicrobial resistance. In patients with frequent relapses , a slow corticosteroid taper could be beneficial.
