 Studies examining perceptual and arterial occlusion responses between blood flow restricted exercise and high load exercise often prescribe an arbitrary number of repetitions , making it difficult for direct comparisons. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to compare these protocols when performed to volitional failure. Individuals completed four exercise conditions varying in load and pressure: ( i) 15 % 1RM; no restrictive pressure , ( ii) 15 % 1RM; 40 % arterial occlusion pressure , ( iii) 15 % 1RM; 80 % arterial occlusion pressure , and ( iv) 70 % 1RM; no pressure. Four sets of knee extension exercises were performed until volitional failure ( or until 90 repetitions per set) was completed. A total of 23 individuals completed the study. While all conditions increased arterial occlusion pressure , the greatest increases ( ~ 30 %) were observed in the blood flow restriction conditions. All lower load conditions resulted in greater RPE and<symptom> discomfort<symptom> than that of the high load condition , but only discomfort was increased further when adding blood flow restriction. High load exercise will likely be perceived more favourably than lower load exercise to volitional failure; however , those who are incapable or unwilling to lift heavier loads may use blood flow restriction to help reduce the volume needed to reach volitional failure , although this will likely increase discomfort.
