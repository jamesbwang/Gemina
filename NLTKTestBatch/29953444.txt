 African Americans , East Asians , and Hispanics with systemic lupus erythematous ( SLE) are more likely to develop lupus nephritis ( LN) than are SLE patients of European descent. The etiology of this difference is not clear , and this study was undertaken to investigate how genetic variants might explain this effect. In this cross-sectional study , 1244 SLE patients from multiethnic case collections were genotyped for 817,810 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) across the genome. Continental genetic ancestry was estimated utilizing the program ADMIXTURE. Gene-based testing and pathway analysis was performed within each ethnic group and meta-analyzed across ethnicities. We also performed candidate SNP association tests with SNPs previously established as risk alleles for SLE , LN , and chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD). Association testing and logistic regression models were performed with LN as the outcome , adjusted for continental ancestries , sex , disease<disease> duration , and age. We studied 255 North European , 263 South European , 238 Hispanic , 224 African American and 264 East Asian SLE patients , of whom 606 had LN ( 48.7 %). In genome-wide gene-based and candidate SNP analyses , we found distinct genes , pathways and established risk SNPs associated with LN for each ethnic group. Gene-based analyses showed significant associations between variation in ZNF546 ( p = 1.0E-06) , TRIM15 ( p = 1.0E-06) , and TRIMI0 ( p = 1.0E-06) and LN among South Europeans , and TTC34 ( p = 8.0E-06) was significantly associated with LN among Hispanics. The SNP rs8091180 in NFATC1 was associated with LN ( OR 1.43 , p = 3.3E-04) in the candidate SNP meta-analysis with the highest OR among African-Americans ( OR 2.17 , p = 0.0035). Distinct genetic factors are associated with the risk of LN in SLE patients of different ethnicities. CKD risk alleles may play a role in the development of LN in addition to SLE-associated risk variants. These findings may further explain the clinical heterogeneity of LN risk and response<symptom> to therapy observed between different ethnic groups.
