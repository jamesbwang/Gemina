 Inflammatory bowel disease<disease> ( IBD) is the name given to two inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> of the colon and/or small intestine: Crohn disease<disease> ( CD) and ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC). There is no information summarizing the complete body of evidence about IBD in developing regions , including Latin America. To estimate the burden of IBD in Latin America. We conducted a systematic review searching published and unpublished studies on major international and regional databases from January 2000 to September 2015. Outcomes considered were incidence , prevalence , mortality , hospitalization attributable , treatment patterns , comparative effectiveness , patient-reported outcomes , and adherence to treatment. Pairs of reviewers independently selected , extracted , and assessed the risk of bias of the studies. Discrepancies were solved by consensus. We retrieved 3445 references , finally including 25 studies. Only 19 % of the observational studies had a low risk of bias for participant selection and 60 % were based on registries. The incidence ranged from 0.74 to 6.76/ 100,000 person-years for UC and from 0.24 to 3.5/ 100,000 person-years for CD. The prevalence rate ranged from 0.99 to 44.3/ 100,000 inhabitants for UC and 0.24 to 16.7/ 100,000 inhabitants for CD. Mortality rates ranged from 0.60 to 1.02 for UC and from 0.23 to 0.40 for CD. Patient-reported outcomes showed a decrease in quality of life associated with depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> and correlated with the time of diagnosis. The most frequently used medication in the studies was mesalazine. The burden of IBD in Latin America seems to be important , but there is a considerable gap of high-quality evidence in the region.
