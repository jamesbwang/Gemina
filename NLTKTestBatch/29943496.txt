 Extending healthy lifespan is an emerging issue in an aging society. This study was designed to identify a dietary method of extending lifespan , promoting renoprotection , and preventing muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> in aged mice , with a focus on the importance of the balance between dietary essential ( EAAs) and nonessential amino acids ( NEAAs) on the dietary restriction ( DR)- induced antiaging effect. Groups of aged mice were fed ad libitum , a simple DR , or a DR with recovering NEAAs or EAAs. Simple DR significantly extended lifespan and ameliorated age-related kidney injury; however , the beneficial effects of DR were canceled by recovering dietary EAA but not NEAA. Simple DR prevented the age-dependent decrease in slow-twitch muscle fiber function but reduced absolute fast-twitch muscle fiber function. DR-induced fast-twitch muscle fiber dysfunction was improved by recovering either dietary NEAAs or EAAs. In the ad libitum-fed and the DR plus EAA groups , the renal content of methionine , an EAA , was significantly higher , accompanied by lower renal<symptom> production<symptom> of hydrogen sulfide ( H
