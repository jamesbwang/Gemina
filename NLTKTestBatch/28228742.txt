 Sleep fosters the consolidation of rewarded memory representations in adults. However , sleep and its memory-supporting functions change through healthy development , and it is unclear whether sleep benefits the consolidation of rewarded memory representations in children as it does in adults. Based on previous findings , we expected sleep to benefit the consolidation of rewarded memory representations in children more than it does in adults. For that reason , 16 children ( 7-11 years) and 20 adults ( 21-29 years) participated in this experiment. During the encoding session , participants were asked to learn the location of 18 object pairs. Thereafter , one-half of the object locations were allocated to a high-rewarded condition and the other half to a low-rewarded condition. In the sleep condition , the encoding session took place in the evening ( for children 7-8 pm , for adults 8-9 pm). After a fixed retention<symptom> interval of 12 h the retrieval session was conducted the next morning ( for children 7-8 am , for adults 8-9 am). In the wake condition , the time schedule was the same but reversed: the encoding session started in the morning ( for children 7-8 am , for adults 8-9 am) , and retrieval took place in the evening ( for children 7-8 pm , for adults 8-9 pm). Sleep/wake had no impact on the memory performance regarding the low-rewarded memory items. In contrast , wakefulness in comparison to sleep reduced the memory performance on high-rewarded memory items. The interaction between sleep/wake and the degree of reward on memory performance was only significant in children. These results show that 12 h of wakefulness can deteriorate the memory performance for high-rewarded representations , whereas sleep can prevent the forgetting of these rewarded representations. It is discussed whether ontogenetic changes in sleep may play a role in conserving relevant but fragile memory representation.
