 Bariatric surgery is the best method for treating obesity and its comorbidities. Our aim was to provide a detailed analysis of the perioperative outcomes in Mexican patients that underwent surgery at a high-volume hospital center. A retrospective study was conducted on all the patients that underwent bariatric surgery at a single hospital center within a time frame of 4 and one-half years. Demographics , the perioperative variables , complications ( early and late) , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , failure , and type 2 diabetes mellitus remission were all analyzed. Five hundred patients were included in the study , 83.2 % of whom were women. Mean patient age was 38.8 years and BMI was 44.1 kg/m In our experience at a high-volume hospital center , bariatric surgery is safe and effective , based on the low number of adverse effects and consequent weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and type 2 diabetes mellitus control. Long-term studies with a larger number of patients are needed to determine the final impact of those procedures.
