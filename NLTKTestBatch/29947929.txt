 Acute ischemic stroke is a treatable disease<disease>. Moreover , there is increasing evidence supporting mechanical recanalization for large-vessel occlusion , even beyond a strict time window. However , only small numbers of patients receive causal treatment. One of the main reasons that patients do not receive causal therapy is their late arrival at the correct target hospital , which , depending on the type of stroke , is either a regional stroke unit or a comprehensive stroke center for interventional treatment. In order to triage patients correctly , a fast and complex diagnostic work-up is necessary , allowing a stroke specialist to decide on the best therapy option. As treatment possibilities become more comprehensive with the need for individualized decisions , the gap between treatment options and practical implementation is increasing. The `` mobile stroke unit '' concept encompasses the administration of prehospital acute stroke diagnostic work-up , therapy initiation , and triage to the correct hospital using a specially equipped ambulance , staffed with a team specialized in stroke. The concept , which was conceived and first put into practice in Homburg/Saar , Germany , in 2008 , is currently spreading with more than 20 active mobile stroke unit centers worldwide. The use of mobile stroke units can reduce the time until stroke treatment by 50 % with a tenfold increase of patients treated within the first 60 min of symptom<symptom> onset. The mobile stroke unit concept for acute stroke prehospital management is spreading worldwide. Intensive research is still needed to analyze the best setting for prehospital stroke management.
