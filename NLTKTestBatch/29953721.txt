 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) is the leading cause of recurrent infections<disease> in humans including endocarditis<disease> , pneumonia<disease> , and toxic shock<symptom> syndrome<symptom>. Novel therapeutics to treat MRSA and other resistant bacteria<pathogen> are urgently needed. Adjuvant therapy , which uses a non-toxic compound to repotentiate the toxic effects of an existing antibiotic , is an attractive response to the growing resistance crisis. Herein we describe the evaluation of structurally-related , FDA-approved tricyclic amine antidepressants that selectively repotentiate MRSA to β-lactam antibiotics. Our results identify important structural features of the tricyclic amine class for β-lactam adjuvant activity. Furthermore , we describe the mechanism of action for our lead compound , amoxapine , and illustrate that it represses the mRNA levels of key β-lactam resistance genes in response to β-lactam treatment. This work is novel in that it highlights an important class of small molecules with the ability to simultaneously inhibit production of both β-lactamase and penicillin-binding protein 2a.
