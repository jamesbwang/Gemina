 Lifestyle interventions remain the cornerstone therapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease<disease> ( NAFLD). This randomised controlled single-blind clinical trial investigated the effect of Mediterranean diet ( MD) or Mediterranean lifestyle , along with weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , in NAFLD patients. In all , sixty-three overweight/obese patients ( 50 ( sd 11) years , BMI = 31 · 8 ( sd 4 · 5) kg/m2 , 68 % men) with ultrasonography-proven NAFLD ( and elevated alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) and/or γ-glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT) levels) were randomised to the following groups: ( A) control group ( CG) , ( B) Mediterranean diet group ( MDG) or ( C) Mediterranean lifestyle group ( MLG). Participants of MDG and MLG attended seven 60-min group sessions for 6 months , aiming at weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and increasing adherence to MD.. In the MLG , additional guidance for increasing physical activity and improving sleep habits were given. Patients in CG received only written information for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of 6 months , 88 · 8 % of participants completed the study. On the basis of intention-to-treat analysis , both MDG and MLG showed greater weight<symptom> reduction and higher adherence to MD compared with the CG ( all P < 0 · 05) at the end of intervention. In addition , MLG increased vigorous exercise compared with the other two study groups ( P < 0 · 001) and mid-day rest/naps compared with CG ( P = 0 · 04). MLG showed significant improvements in ALT levels ( i.e. ALT < 40 U/l ( P = 0 · 03) and 50 % reduction of ALT levels ( P = 0 · 009)) and liver stiffness ( P = 0 · 004) compared with CG after adjusting for % weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and baseline values. MDG improved only liver stiffness compared with CG ( P < 0 · 001) after adjusting for the aforementioned variables. Small changes towards the Mediterranean lifestyle , along with weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , can be a treatment option for patients with NAFLD.
