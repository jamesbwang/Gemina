 Uptake of contraceptives is generally low in low-income settings. For women with HIV<pathogen> , contraception is a reliable and affordable method of minimizing vertical transmission. We investigated the factors that affect contraceptive use among Kenyan women using data collected during the Kenya Demographic & Health Survey ( KDHS) of 2014. Data on contraceptive use were extracted from the 2014 KDHS database. Records of 31,079 Kenyan women of reproductive age ( 15-49 years) were analyzed. Frequencies were calculated; cross-tabulations and bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Twelve thousand thirty-two women ( 39 %) reported using a contraceptive method. Region , religion , education , number of living children , marital status<symptom> , and prior testing for HIV<pathogen> were significantly associated with contraceptive use among women ( P < 0.001). Social , economic , and demographic factors predict contraceptive use among Kenyan women and should be addressed in order to increase contraceptive uptake.
