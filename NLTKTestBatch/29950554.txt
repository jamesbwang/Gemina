 Although crizotinib is standard chemotherapy for advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK)- positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , clinical factors affecting progression-free survival ( PFS) have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to identify clinical factors affecting PFS of crizotinib and develop a prognostic model for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. Clinicopathologic features of patients enrolled in PROFILE 1001 , 1005 , 1007 , and 1014 ( training cohort) were reviewed. We conducted multivariate Cox analysis for PFS and overall survival ( OS) in the training cohort ( n = 159) and generated a proportional hazards model based on significant clinicopathologic factors , and then validated the model in an independent validation cohort ( n = 40). In the training cohort , the objective response rate was 81.5 %. Median PFS and OS from the start of crizotinib were 12.4 and 31.3 months , respectively. Multivariate Cox analysis showed poor performance status<symptom> , number of metastatic organs ( â‰¥ 3) , and no response to crizotinib independently associated shorter PFS. Based on a score derived from these three factors , median PFS and OS of patients with one or two factors were significantly shorter compared to those without these factors ( median PFS , 22.4 months vs. 10.5 months vs. 6.5 months; median OS , not reached vs. 29.1 months vs. 11.8 months , respectively; p < 0.001 for each group). This model also had validated in an independent validation cohort. Performance status<symptom> , number of metastatic organs , and response<symptom> to crizotinib affected PFS of crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. Based on these factors , we developed a simple and useful prediction model for PFS.
