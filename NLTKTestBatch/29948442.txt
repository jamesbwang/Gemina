 Despite the high efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF)/ tacrolimus-based multitarget treatment , risks of infections<disease> are a matter of concern. In the present study , we clarified the potential of multitarget therapy using mizoribine opposed to MMF. A total of 36 patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis were treated with mizoribine , tacrolimus , and glucocorticoids and then retrospectively evaluated. To determine the efficacy , proteinuria<symptom> remission ( â‰¤ 0.2 g/day) , complete remission ( Liu et al. in Ann Intern Med 162:18-26 , 2015) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease<disease> Activity Index ( SLEDAI) remission rates , and the prednisolone dose at months 6 and 12 were evaluated. The associations between serum mizoribine/tacrolimus levels and clinical parameters were investigated. To assess safety , adverse events were inspected. All patients could continue the original treatment regimen without withdrawal<symptom> or exacerbations through month 12. At month 6 , the proteinuria<symptom> remission , complete remission , SLEDAI remission rates , and prednisolone dose were 69 , 53 , 36 % , and 12.1 mg/day , respectively , whereas the values at 12 months were 92 , 67 , 50 % , and 8.8 mg/day , respectively. The treatment was efficacious for every histologic type of nephritis and non-renal manifestations of SLE. Excluding one patient who was hospitalized due to upper respiratory<disease> tract<symptom><disease> infection<disease>infection<disease> , serious infections<disease> , including pneumonia<disease> and cytomegalovirus<pathogen> disease<disease> , were not observed. Higher trough tacrolimus levels were associated with normalization of complement , whereas higher peak mizoribine levels with prevention of cytomegalovirus<pathogen> viremia. Our results suggest that multitarget therapy using mizoribine opposed to MMF is highly safe and effective through 12 months. The therapy may enable faster dose reduction of concomitant glucocorticoids.
