 The mutation rate of an organism is influenced by the interaction of evolutionary forces such as natural selection and genetic drift. However , the mutation spectrum ( i.e. the distribution of different types of mutations) can be heavily influenced by DNA repair. Using mutation-accumulation lines of the extremophile bacterium<pathogen> Deinococcus radiodurans Î”mutS1 and the model soil bacterium<pathogen> Pseudomonas<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> wild-type and MMR- ( Methyl-dependent Mismatch Repair-deficient) strains , we report the mutational features of these two important bacteria<pathogen>. We find that P.<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> has one of the highest MMR repair efficiencies among tested bacteria<pathogen>. We also discover that MMR of D. radiodurans preferentially repairs deletions , contrary to all other bacteria<pathogen> examined. We then , for the first time , quantify genome-wide efficiency and specificity of MMR in repairing different genomic regions and mutation types , by evaluating the P.<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> and D. radiodurans mutation datasets , along with previously-reported ones of Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> subsp. subtilis<pathogen> , Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom> , Vibrio<pathogen> cholerae<pathogen><disease> , and V. fischeri<pathogen>. MMR in all six bacteria<pathogen> shares two general features: 1) repair efficiency is influenced by the neighboring base composition for both transitions and transversions , not limited to transversions as previously reported; and ( 2) MMR only recognizes indels < 4 bp in length. This study demonstrates the power of mutation accumulation lines in quantifying DNA repair and mutagenesis patterns.
