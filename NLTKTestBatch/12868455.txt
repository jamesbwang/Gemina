 Pelvic exenteration ( PE) for primary and recurrent cervical cancer has resulted in favorable survival outcomes , but there are controversies about specific prognosis factors , and up to now , there have been no published reports from China. This study aimed to share our experiences of PE , which were performed in a single institution. From January 2009 to January 2016 , 38 patients with recurrent or persistent cervical cancer were included in the study , and they were followed up until January 2017. Epidemiological and clinicopathological characteristics of patients were compared for survival outcomes in univariate and Cox hazard regression analysis. There were thirty-one and seven patients with recurrent and persistent cervical cancer , respectively. The median age of patients was 45 years ( range 29-65 years). Total , anterior , and posterior PE consisted of 52.6 % , 28.9 % , and 18.4 % of cases , respectively. Early and late complications occurred in 21 ( 55.3 %) patients and 15 ( 39.5 %) patients , respectively. Two ( 5.3 %) patients died due to complications related to surgeries within 3 months after PE. The median overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS) were 28.5 months ( range 9-96 months) and 23 months ( range 4-96 months) , respectively , and 5-year OS and DFS were 48 % and 40 % , respectively. Cox hazard regression analysis showed that , the margin status<symptom> of the incision and mesorectal lymph node status<symptom> were independent risk factors for OS and DFS. In our patients with recurrent and persistent cervical cancer , the practice of PE might achieve favorable survival outcomes.
