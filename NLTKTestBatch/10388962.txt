 This study was conducted to determine the risk factors of major lower extremity amputations in type 2 diabetic patients referred for hospital care with diabetic foot syndrome<symptom>. This retrospective study involved 225 type 2 diabetic patients referred for management of diabetic foot syndrome<symptom> at King Abdullah University Hospital in the period between January 2014 and December 2015. A structured customized diabetic foot data collection form with diabetic foot characteristics chart was used for documentation of relevant information , which checks for age , sex , body mass index , smoking , duration of diabetes , diabetic control therapy , associated hypertension , cardiac diseases<disease> , stroke , chronic renal impairment , renal replacement therapy ( hem-dialysis) , and history of diabetes-related complication in both feet prior to the study period. The predictors for major lower limb amputations were compared between groups using chi-square test , and binary logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with major amputation. Twenty-seven limbs underwent major amputations with an overall rate of major amputation of 11.6 %. The following predictors were found to be associated with the higher incidence of major lower limb amputations: duration of diabetes ≥ 15 years , HbA1c ≥ 8 % , patients on insulin , with hypertension , cardiac diseases<disease> , chronic renal impairment , stroke , having gangrene<disease> , higher number of components , higher Wagner classification , and ischemia. However , the rate did not differ significantly between men and women. Presentation with gangrenous tissue and poor glycemic control are the important risks and significant predictive factors for type 2 diabetes-related major lower limb amputations.
