 Fear of pain plays an important role in the maintenance of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. It may be reduced through exposure therapy. This 2-arm parallel samples , randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate whether interoceptive exposure ( IE) therapy enhances reductions in fear of pain ( primary outcome) , pain ( pain intensity , pain-related disability , school absence) and emotional characteristics ( anxiety<symptom> , catastrophizing) when implemented as an adjunctive treatment in the context of intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment ( IIPT) for pediatric chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> patients. N = 126 adolescents , aged 11-17 years , who were receiving standard IIPT were randomly assigned to either receive additional IE ( n = 64) or additional relaxation therapy ( RT) ( n = 62). All patients were assessed at admission , discharge and three months after discharge. The data of N = 104 patients were analyzed. Significant large reductions were found in the total score and subscale scores of the Fear of Pain Questionnaire for Children in both study groups ( e.g. , total score ( range 0-60; IE/RT): admission M = 23.5/ 24.9; discharge M = 16.0/ 19.7; p < .001 , ŋp = .27) and mainly large reductions in pain characteristics. There were no greater decreases in the IE-group ( p > .1). The exploratory analyses revealed that the patients with high fear of pain before treatment ( p < .05 , ŋp > .03) and the patients with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( p < .04 , ŋp > .25) showed greater decreases in their fear of pain ( total and subscale score) in the IE-group than in the RT-group. In conclusion , the results suggest that IE is not particularly effective for all pediatric chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> patients , but patients with high fear of pain before treatment and with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> strongly benefit from this intervention. This randomized controlled clinical trial was registered in the `` German Clinical Trials Register '' ( trial number: DRKS00010030; name: Randomisiert kontrollierte Studie zur Wirksamkeit der Schmerzprovokation bei Jugendlichen mit chronischen Schmerzstörungen).
