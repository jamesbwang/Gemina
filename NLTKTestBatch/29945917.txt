 Left ventricular ( LV) hypertrophy is associated with cerebrovascular disease<disease> and cognitive decline. Increased LV mass index is a subclinical imaging marker that precedes overt LV hypertrophy. This study relates LV mass index to white matter microstructure and cognition among older adults with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment. Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project participants free of clinical stroke , dementia , and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( n = 318 , 73 Â± 7 years , 58 % male , 39 % mild cognitive impairment) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging , cardiac magnetic resonance , and neuropsychological assessment. Voxelwise analyses related LV mass index ( g/m In the absence of prevalent heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and clinical stroke , increased LV mass index corresponds to altered white matter microstructure , particularly among older adults with clinical symptoms<symptom> of prodromal dementia. Findings highlight the potential link between subclinical LV remodeling and cerebral white matter microstructure vulnerability.
