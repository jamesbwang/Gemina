 Diverticular colitis<disease> , also known as segmental colitis<disease> associated with diverticulosis , is a colonic inflammatory disorder on the spectrum of inflammatory bowel disease<disease> ( IBD). The disease<disease> consists of macroscopic and microscopic inflammation<symptom> affecting inter-diverticular mucosa , sparing peri-diverticular mucosa , with inflammation<symptom> confined to the descending and sigmoid colon. The disease<disease> likely arises from the altered immune response of an individual , genetically susceptible to the IBD spectrum of diseases<disease>. Patients with segmental colitis<disease> associated with diverticulosis ( SCAD) are typically older , and likely represent a subgroup of IBD-susceptible patients who lacked an environmental trigger until that point in their life. Most patients remain in remission with initial treatments of mesalamine or topical steroids , and maintenance mesalamine afterwards. Only the most severe form of the disease<disease> necessitates immunomodulatory therapy and the consideration of surgery.
