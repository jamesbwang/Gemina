 Modulation of the collagen-rich extracellular matrix ( ECM) in solid tumors by the treatment with collagenase has been proved effective in enhancement of the interstitial transport and antitumor efficacy of antibodies. We , therefore , developed a PLGA-PEG-PLGA polymer-based thermosensitive hydrogel , which incorporated a HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and collagenase ( Col/Tra/Gel) for peritumoral administration. HER2-positvie BT474 tumor-bearing mice were selected as a model. The Col/Tra/Gel showed the continuous and biphasic release of protein drugs for 9 days in vitro. NIR imaging studies demonstrated a long-term retention<symptom> of Col/Tra/Gel hydrogel in the peritumoral area for over 20 days. Treatment with Col/Tra/Gel reduced the collagen density and enhanced apoptotic cell death in tumor tissue , resulting in superior treatments with increased efficacy and reduced toxicity compared with other control groups. Moreover , a quarter-dose of Col/Tra/Gel exhibited a better antitumor efficacy than that of intravenous injection of clinical trastuzumab formulation. This localized co-delivery system offers a potential strategy for the modulation of dense ECM and enhancement of antibody efficacy.
