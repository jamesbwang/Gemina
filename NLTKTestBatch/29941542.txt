 Post-translational modifications in intestinal epithelial cells ( IECs) allow for precise control in intestinal homeostasis , the breakdown of which may precipitate the pathological damage and inflammation<symptom> in inflammatory bowel disease<disease>. The O-linked Î²-N-acetylglucosamine ( O-GlcNAc) modification on intracellular proteins controls diverse biological processes; however , its roles in intestinal homeostasis are still largely unexplored. Here , we found that levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation and the expression of O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT) , the enzyme adding the O-GlcNAc moiety , were reduced in IECs in human IBD patients. Deletion of OGT specifically in IECs resulted in disrupted epithelial barrier , microbial dysbiosis , Paneth cell dysfunction , and intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in mice. Using fecal microbiota transplantation in mice , we demonstrated that microbial dysbiosis although was insufficient to induce spontaneous inflammation<symptom> but exacerbated chemical-induced colitis<disease>. Paneth cell-specific deletion of OGT led to Paneth cell dysfunction , which might predispose mice to chemical-induced colitis<disease>. On the other hand , the augmentation of O-GlcNAc signaling by inhibiting O-GlcNAcase , the enzyme removing O-GlcNAcylation , alleviated chemical-induced colitis<disease>. Our data reveal that protein O-GlcNAcylation in IECs controls key regulatory mechanisms to maintain mucosal homeostasis.
