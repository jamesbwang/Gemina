 Spontaneous coronary artery dissection ( SCAD) is an unusual cause of acute coronary syndrome<symptom> ( ACS). Better recognition and diagnosis has raised awareness of this condition. However , the pathophysiology of SCAD and its prognosis are still little understood. We aimed to investigate the characteristics and prognosis of patients with SCAD , and subsequently performed a review of literature. Single-center , retrospective study performed in patients hospitalized from January 2010 to December 2016 with suspected ACS ( n = 5002) whose final diagnosis was SCAD ( n = 27; 0.5 %). Patients with SCAD were mainly female ( 81.5 %; n = 22) , with median age of 56. Predisposing factors were identified in 12 ( 44 %) patients and precipitating factors in three ( 11.1 %). Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI) was the main form of presentation ( 51.9 %). The left anterior descending artery ( LAD) territory was the most commonly involved ( n = 12 , 44.4 %). Type 2 dissection was the most prevalent angiographic pattern ( n = 17 , 63 %). The majority of patients ( n = 15; 55.6 %) were managed medically and the remaining patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) with drug-eluting stents. Seven patients re-infarcted while in the hospital. Over the median follow-up period of 20 months , 7.4 % of patients ( n = 2) had symptoms<symptom> of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) and 14.8 % developed ACS ( in three patients the event occurred in a coronary territory other than that of the index case , and in one patient it occurred in the previously affected territory). There were no deaths. In the studied population , SCAD was more prevalent in middle-aged women. Despite the high prevalence of in-hospital re-infarction or during follow-up , the prognosis was good overall.
