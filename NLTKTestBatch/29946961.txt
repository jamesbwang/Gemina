 Opioid dependence is a chronic mental disease<disease> with multifactorial etiology. The neurobiological theory of addiction focuses on the manipulation of the dopaminergic reward system as a basic property of substances with addictive potential including opioids. With regular opioid intake , the manipulation of the reward system results in a cognitive bias towards drug-related stimuli. In addition , opioids inhibit the locus caeruleus , resulting in symptoms<symptom> of sympathetic rebound during opioid detoxification. The pharmacokinetics of opioids also influence the risk of addiction. These biological factors are independent of the legal status<symptom> of the individual opioid. Genetics also significantly influence the etiology. However , the assignment of this genetic influence is difficult because not only basic biological functions , but also personality traits and mental illnesses are genetically determined.
