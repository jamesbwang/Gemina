 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) can retard the progression of early infantile Krabbe disease<disease> ( EIKD). Superior outcomes are achieved if HSCT is performed before the onset of symptoms<symptom>; however , little information is available about the long-term outcomes in surviving patients. We now describe functional outcomes in presymptomatic infants who underwent HSCT for EIKD at ≤ 2 months of age. Records of the 19 patients who underwent HSCT for EIKD at ≤ 2 months of age from 1996 to 2010 were reviewed. Long-term functional outcomes were compared between those transplanted at < 30days and ≥ 30days of life. Median age at transplant was 27days ( range , 19 to 61). Median follow-up of the cohort was 12.6 years. Overall survival at 5 and 10 years post-transplant was 84.2 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 58.7 % to 94.6 %) and 78.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 52.5 % to 91.4 %) , respectively. More favorable outcomes were seen in patients who underwent HSCT at < 30days of age , particularly in domains of mobility ( P = .01) , communication ( P = .02) , and feeding ( P = .008). Improved functional outcomes were observed when HSCT was performed in the first month of life , defining a critical period for intervention. These results support the implementation of newborn screening to enable rapid diagnosis and early treatment of infants with EIKD.
