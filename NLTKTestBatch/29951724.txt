 Obesity is a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD). However , it remains to be fully examined whether fatness is more useful in predicting incident CKD. We aimed this study to determine the association of body fat , body mass index and waist circumference ( WC) with subsequent changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) and incident CKD in young- to middle-aged working men. We analyzed data from annual health check-up in male workers aged from 20 to 60 years with basal eGFR of 60-90 mL/min/1 .73 m There were 8,015 men participants. During the 5-year follow-up , 11.0 % of the participants ( N = 878) had developed to incident CKD. When basal WC was greater than 80.0 cm , which was decided by Youden 's Index , there was a significantly higher risk of incident CKD ( OR 1.57 ( 95 % confident interval 1.35-1.84)). Changes in WC over 5 years were significantly related to eGFR decline in young men ( < 40 years old) with normal blood<symptom> pressures<symptom> and normoglycemia. These findings suggest that WC > 80.0 cm is a risk factor for incident CKD and strongly associated with a decline in eGFR in the young- to middle-aged working healthy men.
