 The functional outcome in schizophrenia spectrum disorders is affected by multiple factors such as cognitive performance and clinical symptoms<symptom>. Psychiatric disability may be another important determinant of functional outcome. The purpose of this study was to test whether schizophrenia symptoms<symptom> and psychiatric disability mediated the association between cognition and functioning. Between April 2013 and July 2017 , we included 108 community-dwelling adults with stable schizophrenia spectrum disorder in a multicenter study. Psychiatric disability was assessed with the Evaluation of Cognitive Processes involved in Disability in Schizophrenia ( ECPDS) scale by relatives of patients. ECPDS focused on the broad array of motivational , neurocognitive , sociocognitive , and metacognitive impairments that result in activity restrictions. We used a battery of tests to assess seven cognition domains ( processing speed , attention/vigilance , working , verbal and visual memory , reasoning and problem solving , and executive functioning) and cross-sectional structural equation modeling ( SEM) for the mediation analyses. We estimated the one-year temporal stability of ECPDS scores in 45 participants. The model provided showed good fit and explained 43.9 % of the variance in functioning. The effect of neurocognition on functioning was fully mediated by symptoms<symptom> ( proportion mediated: 36.5 %) and psychiatric disability ( proportion mediated: 31.3 %). The ECPDS score had acceptable one-year temporal stability. The ECPDS scale has satisfactory psychometric properties , and shows significant convergence with neurocognition and functioning , suggesting a role for this tool in the routine evaluation of cognitive remediation needs. Our model validates psychiatric disability as a crucial step from cognitive impairment to restricted participation in life situations.
