 Endosomes have emerged as a central hub and pathogenic driver of Alzheimer 's disease<disease> ( AD). The earliest brain cytopathology in neurodegeneration , occurring decades before amyloid plaques and cognitive decline , is an expansion in the size and number of endosomal compartments. The strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE4). Previous studies have shown that ApoE4 potentiates presymptomatic endosomal dysfunction and defective endocytic clearance of amyloid beta ( Aβ) , although how these two pathways are linked at a cellular and mechanistic level has been unclear. Here , we show that aberrant endosomal acidification in ApoE4 astrocytes traps the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein ( LRP1) within intracellular compartments , leading to loss<symptom> of surface expression and Aβ clearance. Pathological endosome acidification is caused by ε4 risk allele-selective down-regulation of the Na
