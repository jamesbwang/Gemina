 Pulmonary localisation represents only 15 % of all cases of actinomycosis<disease>. The clinical symptoms<symptom> and radiological changes of this disease<disease> are non-specific and sometimes it can be misdiagnosed , usually as tuberculosis<disease> , lung cancer or lung abscess<symptom>. In the reported case , what might look like the lung cancer , finally turned out to be actinomycosis<disease>. The interesting case is presented of lung actinomycosis<disease> in a 77-year-old farmer , admitted to the Department of Pneumonology , Oncology and Allegology in Lublin due to a massive haemoptysis. CT scan of the chest showed , apart from other changes , the spicular consolidation in the right lung which aroused oncology vigilance. The diagnostic path , which was a real medical challenge , led to the diagnosis of actinomycosis<disease>. The process of diagnosis and consequent treatment , which led to the complete regression of clinical and radiological changes , is presented.
