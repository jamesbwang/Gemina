 Inflammatory processes have been shown to play an important role in the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Innate and adaptive immune responses participate in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> elevation and end-organ damage. Here we discuss recent studies focusing on novel inflammatory and immune mechanisms that play roles in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> elevation. Different subpopulations of cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses , such as dendritic cells , monocytes/macrophages and natural killer cells on the one hand , and B and T lymphocytes on the other , contribute to vascular and kidney injury in hypertension. Unconventional innate-like T cells such as γδ T cells also participate in hypertensive mechanisms by priming both innate and adaptive immune cells contributing to trigger vascular inflammation and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> elevation. These cells exert their effects in part via production of various cytokines including pro-inflammatory interferon γand interleukin 17 , and anti-inflammatory interleukin 10. The present review summarizes some of these immune mechanisms that participate in the pathophysiology of hypertension.
