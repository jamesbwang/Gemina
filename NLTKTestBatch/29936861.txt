 Ranpirnase ( RNP) is a low molecular weight<symptom> type III endoribonuclease , which demonstrates broad antiviral and antitumor properties. We sought to characterize the antiviral activity of RNP against HIV-1 and to determine if RNP modulates local inflammatory changes associated with HIV<pathogen> infection<disease> in the colorectal explant model. Colorectal explants were incubated for 2 hours with HIV-1BaL , in the presence of increasing concentrations of RNP ( 0-60 g/mL). After washing , explants were cultured for 14 days , with supernatant collected at Days 3 , 7 , 10 and 14. All samples were assayed for HIV-1 p24. Additionally , 30 soluble inflammatory biomarkers were assayed in the Day 3 supernatant sample. Additional biopsies were stimulated with LPS ( 10μg/mL) in the presence of RNP and soluble biomarkers assayed at Day 3. RNP inhibited productive infection<disease> of the colorectal explants with HIV-1 <sub> BaL </sub> and induced a dose-dependent decrease in 15/30 biomarkers. Affected biomarkers included IP-10 , MDC , MIP-1α , MIP-1β , TARC , IL12-p40 , IL-15 , IL-17 , IL-1α , IL-7 , IFN-γ , IL12-p70 , IL-1β , IL-4 , IL-5 and TNF-β. Similarly , RNP dose dependent inhibition was demonstrated in 7/30 biomarkers after LPS stimulation , all of which overlapped with HIV-1BaL induced biomarker changes. The ability of RNP to inhibit both colorectal explant HIV-1 <sub> BaL </sub> infection<disease> and inflammatory changes associated with HIV-1 infection<disease> , makes RPN a promising agent for topical rectal pre-exposure prophylaxis.
