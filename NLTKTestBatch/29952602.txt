 During adolescence , a positive outlook toward the future ( i.e. , future orientation) can protect youth from the risks conferred by childhood adversity. Research to date , however , has largely considered future orientation as a static attribute. Developmental systems perspectives suggest that future orientation , when considered across time , will exhibit dynamic trajectories with levels changing in response to the varying balance<symptom> of risks and resources in youths ' environments. Investigating the developmental course and consequences of future orientation is particularly germane to maltreated youth who may benefit from programs that target this protective mechanism. The present study tested hypotheses regarding the developmental course of future orientation , including the association of distinct future orientation trajectories with time-varying risk factors and resources , and the association of continuity and change<symptom> in future orientation trajectories with young adult psychosocial functioning. Hypotheses were investigated with longitudinal ( T1
