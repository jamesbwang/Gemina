 Activity trackers are designed to support individuals in monitoring and increasing their physical activity. The use of activity trackers among individuals diagnosed with depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> has not yet been examined. This pilot study investigates how this target group engages with an activity tracker during a 10-week health intervention aimed to increase their physical activity level and improve their physical and mental health. Two groups of 11 young adults ( aged 18-29 years) diagnosed with depression<symptom> or anxiety<symptom> participated in the digital health intervention. The study used mixed methods to investigate the research question. Quantitative health data were used to assess the intervention 's influence on the participants ' health and qualitative data provided insights into the participants ' digital health experience. The study demonstrated an ambiguous influence from the use of an activity tracker with positive physical and mental health results , but a fading and even negative digital health engagement and counterproductive competition. The ambiguous results identify a need for ( 1) developing strategies for health professionals to provide supervised use of activity trackers and support the target groups ' abilities to convert health information about physical activity into positive health strategies , and ( 2) designing alternatives for health promoting IT targeted users who face challenges and need motivation beyond self-tracking and competition.
