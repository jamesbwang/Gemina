 Recent years have witnessed impressive advances in our understanding of iron metabolism. A number of studies of iron disorders and of their animal models have provided landmark insights into the mechanisms of iron trafficking , distribution and homeostatic regulation , the latter essential to prevent both iron deficiency and iron excess<symptom>. Our perception of iron metabolism has been completely changed by an improved definition of cellular and systemic iron homeostasis , of the molecular pathogenesis of iron disorders , the fine tuning of the iron hormone hepcidin by activators and inhibitors and the dissection of the components of the hepcidin regulatory pathway. Important for haematology , the crosstalk of erythropoiesis , the most important iron consumer , and the hepcidin pathway has been at least partially clarified. Novel potential biomarkers are available and novel therapeutic targets for iron-related disorders have been tested in murine models. These preclinical studies provided proofs of principle and are laying the ground for clinical trials. Understanding iron control in tissues other than erythropoiesis remains a challenge for the future.
