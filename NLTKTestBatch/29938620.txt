 The aim of this review is to present , critically appraise and qualitatively synthesize current evidence on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) development during menopause , the management of climacteric symptoms<symptom> in women with T2DM and the management of T2DM in postmenopausal women. Menopause represents the end of reproductive life in women , as a result of ovarian aging. It is characterized by substantial decrease in the endogenous oestrogen concentrations and it is accompanied by alterations in body<symptom> weight , adipose tissue distribution and energy expenditure , as well as insulin secretion , insulin sensitivity and activity that can predispose to the development of T2DM , independently of , and additively to , aging. Many women in midlife experience climacteric symptoms<symptom> , including hot flushes and night<symptom> sweats<symptom> , resulting in an indication to receive Hormone Replacement Treatment ( HRT). HRT has a favourable effect on glucose homeostasis both in women without and with T2DM. The latter was considered in the past as a cardiovascular disease<disease> ( CVD) equivalent , which would suggest that women with the disease<disease> should not receive HRT. However , nowadays evidence exists to support an individualized approach of women based on their CVD risk , as some women with T2DM may be excellent candidates for HRT. Regarding T2DM management for women in menopause , lifestyle intervention , including diet and exercise , constitutes its cornerstone. However , most of these women will eventually require pharmacologic therapy. The most suitable agents should be selected according to their metabolic , cardiovascular and bone effects , taking into consideration the specific characteristics and comorbidities of each postmenopausal woman.
