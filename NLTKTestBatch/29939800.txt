 Limited research exists regarding physical therapy management for patients with cervical dystonia ( CD). The purpose of this case report is to describe the clinical management of a patient with CD using manual techniques , cervical traction , and laser-guided postural reeducation. The patient was a 75-year-old female with CD , diagnosed 40 years prior , with a 10-year history of botulinum<pathogen> neurotoxin injections. She reported a 1-year history of worsening neck<symptom> pain<symptom> and cervical range of motion loss which was significantly affecting her ability to sleep and drive. The patient was seen for 12 visits over a 6-week period. Discharge scores indicated marked improvements in active range of motion , neck disability index , and the CDIP-58 questionnaire. Improvement in motor control as measured during the SenMorCor â„¢ Laser Functional Error Assessment was demonstrated in the motions of `` looking right<symptom> '' ( 53 %) and up ( 48 %). This case report indicates that a physical therapy program consisting of a daily laser-guided home program for head<disease> postural reeducation in conjunction with classic physical therapy techniques may be an option for patients with CD; however , further research is needed prior to adoption of these techniques as standard of care for patients with CD.
