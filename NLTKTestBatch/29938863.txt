 The paradox of high genetic variation observed in traits under stabilizing selection is a long-standing problem in evolutionary theory , as mutation rates appear too low<symptom> to explain observed levels of standing genetic variation under classic models of mutation-selection balance<symptom>. Spatially or temporally heterogeneous environments can maintain more standing genetic variation within populations than homogeneous environments , but it is unclear whether such conditions can resolve the above discrepancy between theory and observation. Here , we use individual-based simulations to explore the effect of various types of environmental heterogeneity on the maintenance of genetic variation ( V
