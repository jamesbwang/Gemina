Different parts of the plant are rich with various phytoconstituents which include diterpenoids ( ceriopsin A-G) , triterpenoids ( lupeol , Î±-amyrin , oleanolic acid , ursolic acid) , and phenolics ( catechin , procyanidins). These phytoconstituents and their derivatives could form a new basis for developing new drugs against various diseases<disease>. The objective of the present study is to compile the phytochemical , ethnobotanical , biological , and pharmacological significance of the plant to provide directions for future research to find out therapeutically active lead compounds for developing new drugs against diseases<disease> of current interest including diabetes , inflammation<symptom> , and cancer.
