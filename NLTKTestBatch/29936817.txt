 Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> E<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HEV<pathogen>) , the last of the five hepatotropic viruses<pathogen> to be discovered , was originally considered to cause an acute , travel-associated self-limiting illness restricted to humans; however , new research shows that there are animal reservoirs and zoonotic transmission. Additionally , HEV<pathogen> is now considered as a major health burden worldwide , leading to significant morbidity and mortality; therefore , the topic of hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> E<pathogen><disease> is of re-emerging importance , having brought to light important questions such as the transmission of HEV<pathogen> , especially in developed countries , as well as treatment and vaccination options. HEV<pathogen> belongs to the genus Hepevirus<pathogen> in the <i> Hepeviridae </i> family. The HEV<pathogen> genome sequence is relatively stable; however , there is a diversity of genotypes which are helpful in comprehending the epidemiological phenomena. HEV<pathogen> is classified based on the nucleotide sequences of the genome and is now characterised as a single serotype with four major genotypes ( HEV<pathogen> 1-4). Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> E<pathogen><disease> cases are not clinically distinguishable from other types of acute viral hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> , although diagnosis can be strongly suspected in certain epidemiological settings. It is imperative to raise awareness among physicians about the importance of HEV<pathogen> , with the aim of helping recognise , prevent and treat HEV<pathogen> infections. This review article highlights the current developments of HEV<pathogen> in microbiology , epidemiology , clinical features , treatment and prophylaxis.
