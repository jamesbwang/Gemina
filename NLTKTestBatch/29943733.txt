 Hepatic mitochondrial function ( HMF) assessed by the < sup > 13 </ sup > C-ketoisocaproate breath test ( < sup > 13 </ sup > C-KICA BT) has been previously shown to be significantly associated with the severity of biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease<disease> ( NAFLD). However , it is uncertain whether any perturbation in HMF relates specifically to severity of liver disease<disease> or factors associated with metabolic syndrome<symptom> within non-alcoholic fatty liver disease<disease> ( NAFLD). Our aim was to investigate whether there was any change in HMF assessed by < sup > 13 </ sup > C-KICA BT in patients with NAFLD compared to control subjects , and to assess the factors that are independently associated with HMF. 77 patients with NAFLD and 11 healthy control subjects were studied. HMF was assessed using < sup > 13 </ sup > C-KICA BT and expressed as cumulative % < sup > 13 </ sup > C-dose recovered on breath over 1 hr ( cPDR over 1 hr). Liver fat and fibrosis<disease> was assessed by transient elastography. Multi-variable linear regression modelling was undertaken to test the independence of associations with HMF. HMF ( cPDR over 1 hr) was lower in NAFLD compared to controls ( 13.4 % ( 4.8) v. 21.0 % ( 6.3); p < 0.0001)). In NAFLD , HMF was lower in patients with diabetes versus no diabetes ( 12.7 % ( 3.4) v. 14.3 % ( 6.1); p = 0.003)). Regression modelling showed age ( β = -0.08; p = 0.01) , waist circumference ( β = -0.08; p = 0.01) , hip circumference ( β = -0.04; p = 0.01) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) ( β = -0.05; p = 0.01) and diabetes status<symptom> ( β = -1.81; p = 0.01) were independently associated with HMF ( R < sup > 2 </ sup > = 41.5 %; p < 0.0001). In patients with NAFLD ( compared to healthy subjects) , there was a reduction in HMF assessed by the < sup > 13 </ sup > C-KICA BT. Furthermore , in patients with NAFLD , HMF is independent and inversely associated with age , waist and hip circumference , AST and diabetes status<symptom>.
