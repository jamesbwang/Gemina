 Little data exist on acute kidney injury ( AKI) risk factors in pediatric sepsis<disease>. We identified risk factors and inpatient outcomes associated with AKI at sepsis<disease> recognition in children with severe sepsis<disease>. Retrospective , cross-sectional study with inpatient outcome description of 315 patients > 1 month to < 20 years old with severe sepsis<disease> in a pediatric intensive care unit over 3 years. Exposures included demographics , vitals , and laboratory data. The primary outcome was kidney disease<disease>: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine-defined AKI within 24 h of sepsis<disease> recognition. Factors associated with AKI and AKI severity were identified using multivariable Poisson and multinomial logistic regression , respectively. AKI was present in 42 % ( 133/315) of severe sepsis<disease> patients , and 26 % ( 83/315) had severe ( stage 2/3) AKI. In multivariable-adjusted analysis , hematologic/immunologic comorbidities , malignancies , chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD) , abdominal<disease> infection<disease>infection<disease> , admission illness severity , and minimum systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) ≤ 5th percentile for age and sex within 24 h of sepsis<disease> recognition were associated with AKI. Factors associated with mild AKI were CKD and abdominal<disease> infection<disease>infection<disease> , while factors associated with severe AKI were younger age , hematologic/immunologic comorbidities , malignancy , abdominal<disease> infection<disease>infection<disease> , and minimum SBP ≤ 5th percentile. Patients with AKI had increased hospital mortality ( 17 vs. 8 % , P = 0.02) and length of stay ( median 20 ( IQR 10-47) vs. 16 days ( IQR 7-37) , P = 0.03). In pediatric severe sepsis<disease> , AKI is associated with age , comorbidities , infection<disease> characteristics , and hypotension<symptom>. Future evaluation of risk factors for AKI progression during sepsis<disease> is warranted to minimize AKI progression in this high-risk population.
