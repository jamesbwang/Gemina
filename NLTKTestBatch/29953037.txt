 Brucellosis<disease> , an endemic zoonosis in Portugal , is a multisystem disease<disease> , presenting with neurological manifestations in up to 25 % of cases. Neurobrucellosis diagnostic criteria include evidence of central nervous system invasion , either by documenting increased blood-brain barrier permeability that normalizes after treatment or by Brucella isolation. We report 2 patients with systemic brucellosis<disease> presenting with neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom>: A 28-year-old female with progressive hemiparesis<symptom> associated with severe refractory thoracic and lumbar pain , whose spinal magnetic resonance imaging identified longitudinally extensive myelitis. Brucella agglutination test was positive in blood; however , cerebrospinal fluid cytochemical , serological testing , and cultures were negative. A 58-year-old male with intermittent fever<symptom> in the evening , associated with severe refractory cervical and lumbar spinal and radicular pain. Blood workup identified leukocytosis , elevated inflammatory markers and positive Brucella agglutination test. Cerebrospinal fluid presented mild protein increase and negative serological testing and cultures. Electromyogram revealed demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. In both cases , antibiotic therapy induced symptom<symptom> resolution. Despite the neurological presentation , no evidence of direct nervous system infection<disease> was found. An indirect mechanism appears to be involved , such as a parainfectious syndrome<symptom> or circulating endotoxins release by the bacteria<pathogen>. Brucellosis<disease> should be considered in patients presenting with inflammatory neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in endemic regions. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important as chronic<disease> infection<disease>infection<disease> has significant morbidity.
