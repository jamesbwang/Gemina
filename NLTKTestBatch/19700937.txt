 Management of advanced/recurrent low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma ( LGOSC) is often challenging. Effective treatment options remain limited for hormone and chemotherapy-resistant LGSOC.CASE: A 65-year-old woman with recurrent widespread LGSOC harboring the KRAS-G12 V hotspot mutation experienced a dramatic clinical response to Binimetinib ( MEK162) , a mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MEK) inhibitor , after failing multiple chemotherapy and hormonal treatments. An 81 % reduction of target lesions<symptom> by RECIST 1.1 over 31 months of response duration was confirmed with serial CT scans. Episodes of drug-related toxicity ( pneumonitis<disease>) easily resolved without sequelae with the use of oral steroids. Binimetinib may present a new treatment option for hormone- and chemotherapy-resistant LGSOC harboring
