 In this study the M- and L-edge X-ray absorption spectra of a series of open- and closed-shell solids ( TiO2 rutile , Î±-Fe2O3 hematite , FeS2 pyrite , and the spinel Co3O4) are investigated with the restricted open-shell configuration interaction singles methods ( ROCIS/DFT and PNO-ROCIS/DFT) using the embedded cluster approach. ROCIS/DFT type of methods are grounded in wavefunction-based ab initio electronic structure theory and has shown great performance in the field of X-ray spectroscopy in particular in the field of transition metal L-edge spectroscopy. In this work we show that ROCIS/DFT can be used to calculate and interpret metal M- and L-edge XAS spectra of solids. To this end , clusters with up to 52 metal centers are considered. In all cases good to excellent agreement between theory and experiment is obtained. The experimentally probed local coordination<symptom> environments are discussed in detail. The physical origin of the observed spectral features is explored through the machinery of natural difference orbitals ( NDOs). This analysis provides valuable information with respect to the core to valence , metal to metal charge transfer ( MMCT) and metal to ligand charge transfer ( MLCT) characters of the relativistically corrected many particle states. The influence of the above electronic effects to the spectral shapes and the size of the treated clusters are thoroughly investigated.
