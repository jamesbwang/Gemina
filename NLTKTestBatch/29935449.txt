 In this study , the simulations generated by two of the most widely used hydrological basin-scale models , the Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source ( AnnAGNPS) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ( SWAT) , were compared in a Mediterranean watershed , the Carapelle ( Apulia , Southern Italy). Input data requirements , time and efforts needed for input preparation , strength and weakness<symptom> points of each model , ease of use and limitations were evaluated in order to give information to users. Models were calibrated and validated at monthly time scale for hydrology and sediment load using a four year period of observations ( streamflow and suspended sediment concentrations). In the driest year , the specific sediment load measured at the outlet was 0.89 t ha
