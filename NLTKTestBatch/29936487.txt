 Peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian cancer is unfortunately a very common finding , especially in patients diagnosed in very late stages of the disease<disease>. Nonetheless , it is not the only pathological condition inducing a diffuse involvement of the peritoneum; other entities can have an infectious or miscellaneous origin. However , the association of peritoneal carcinomatosis and parasitic infection has never been reported so far. We present the case of a 50-year-old patient who had been submitted to surgery for a hepatic hydatid cyst<disease><symptom>. Four years later , the patient was diagnosed with disseminated peritoneal lesions<symptom> , which proved to have both parasite and neoplastic origin. The patient was re-submitted to surgery , and debulking resection of all pathological lesions<symptom> was achieved. Although it is very rare , the association of peritoneal carcinomatosis and peritoneal hydatidosis should be taken into consideration whenever the patient reports a suggestive medical history for those two pathological findings.
