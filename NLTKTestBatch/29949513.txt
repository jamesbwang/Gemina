 Vitamin D regulates the concentrations of calcium and phosphate in blood and promotes the growth and remodeling of bones. The circulating active form of vitamin D , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , binds to the vitamin D receptor ( VDR) , which heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor to regulate the expression of target genes. Inactivating mutations in the VDR gene cause hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets ( HVDRR) , a rare disorder characterized by an early onset of rickets , growth retardation , skeletal deformities , hypocalcemia , hypophosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism , and in some cases alopecia. We describe eight new HVDRR patients from four unrelated consanguineous families. The VDR gene was sequenced to identify mutations. The management of patients over a period of up to 11 years following the initial diagnosis is assessed. Although all patients exhibit main features of HVDRR and carry the same c. 885C > A ( p.Y295 *) loss of function mutation in the VDR gene , there was heterogeneity of the manifestations of HVDRR-associated phenotypes and developmental milestones. These eight patients were successfully treated over a period of 11 years. All clinical symptoms<symptom> were improved except alopecia. The study concludes that VDR sequencing and laboratory tests are essential to confirm HVDRR and to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.
