 From 2003 to date there has been a rising number of reports from developed countries on cases of lymphogranuloma<disease> venereum<disease> with anorectal localization in HIV-infected men who have sex with men. This localization differs from the classical inguinal abscesses<symptom> which are typical of the disease<disease> in the tropics. The objective of this work is to document the presence of anorectal lymphogranuloma<disease> venereum<disease> in Buenos Aires and to describe its varied clinical manifestations. In the context of a systematic survey of rectal chlamydial infection , in just one trimester , eight cases of lymphogranuloma<disease> venereum<disease> caused by Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> biovar<pathogen> LGV were identified in HIV-infected men who have sex with men. The most frequent anorectal manifestations were pus , tenesmus<symptom> , rectal urgency , and mucous or haemopurulent discharge. The proctitis<disease> was mostly mild or moderate and , in some cases , it was accompanied by perianal lesions<symptom>. Given the great polymorphism and unspecificity of the clinical manifestations of the disease<disease> , we warn on the presence of this form of rectal lymphogranuloma<disease> venereum<disease> in our setting. If Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> is detected , it should be genotyped , not only for the correct diagnosis and treatment but also for epidemiological surveillance. Where genotyping is not available , the disease<disease> must be considered as caused by the LGV biovar<pathogen> and treated accordingly.
