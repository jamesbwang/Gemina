 Aggressive lymphomas exhibit the Warburg effect. Lactic acidosis is a result of overproduction of lactate and leads to a fatal prognosis. Mutation of p53 helps cancer cells survive glutamine deprivation. PI3K regulates fatty acid synthesis ( FAS) in primary effusion<symptom> lymphoma ( PEL) and other B-NHLs. AMPK regulates NADPH balance for fatty acid oxidation as a means of supplementing the TCA cycle. PRPS2 couples protein and nucleotide biosynthesis to drive lymphomagenesis. mTOR activation promotes fatty acid synthesis ( FAS). MYC regulates cancer cell metabolism under glucose-deprived and hypoxic conditions. HIF-1 acts as a regulator in hypoxia adaption and the related metabolic change.
