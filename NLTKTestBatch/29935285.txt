 Tolls and Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) were the first pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs) identified to play key roles in host innate immunity. However , relatively little is known about other types of Toll-like receptors in Scylla<pathogen> paramamosain<pathogen> , although a Toll-like receptor ( SpToll1) has recently been cloned. In this study , we cloned and characterized another novel Toll-like receptor 2 ( SpToll2) from S.<pathogen> paramamosain<pathogen>. The full-length cDNA of SpToll2 is 3391 bp with a 2646 bp open reading frame ( ORF<pathogen>) encoding a putative protein of 881 amino acids , and predicted to contain six extracellular leucine-rich repeat ( LRR) domains , a transmembrane domain and an intracellular Toll/IL -1 receptor ( TIR) domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SpToll2 clustered with Drosophila Toll1 , and shared high homology with PtToll4. Real-time qPCR analysis showed that SpToll2 was widely expressed in all tissues tested , with the highest level found in hemocytes and hepatopancreas while the lowest in heart and muscle. The transcript levels of both SpToll1 and SpToll2 in mud<disease> crabs hemocytes was induced following challenge with Vibrio<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> , Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid ( Poly I: C) and white spot syndrome<symptom> virus<pathogen> ( WSSV). In addition , recombinant SpToll1-LRR and SpToll2-LRR proteins could bind to V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> , S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , and Beta Streptococcus<pathogen>. In order to study the signaling pathway of AMPs ' expression in mud<disease> crab , RNA interference were used to test the expression of SpAMPs after the challenges with V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> or S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. The data suggested that SpToll1and SpToll2 could regulate the transcripts of several AMPs and four immune related mediators ( SpMyD88 , SpTube , SpPelle and SpTRAF6) at different scale. While silencing of SpToll1 post pathogens challenge attenuated the expression of SpHistin , SpALF1 and SpALF5 in mud<disease> crab 's hemocytes , depletion of SpToll2 post pathogens challenge inhibited the expression of SpALF1-6 , SpGRP , SpArasin and SpHyastastin. Furthermore , the results of overexpression assay also showed SpToll1 and SpToll2 could enhance the promoter activities of SpALFs in mud<disease> crab. Taken together , these results indicated that SpToll1 and SpToll2 might play important roles in host defense against pathogen invasions in S.<pathogen> paramamosain<pathogen>.
