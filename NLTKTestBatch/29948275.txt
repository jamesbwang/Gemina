 The aim of this double-blind , randomized trial was to evaluate the 1-year clinical performance of a bulk-fill flowable and a regular nanofilled composite in non-carious cervical<symptom> lesions<symptom> ( NCCLs). Twenty-two subjects with at least two NCCLs were enrolled in the study. A total of 89 restorations were performed by a single operator using Filtek Supreme ( FS) Ultra Universal or Filtek Bulk ( FB) Fill Flowable. A universal adhesive ( Scotchbond ™ Universal Adhesive) was used with a self-etching approach in dentin. The restorations were evaluated by two independent and previously calibrated examiners at baseline ( 7 days) , 6 months and 1 year , according to the USPHS modified criteria. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the differences between composites and Wilcoxon signed rank test for comparisons between the baseline and follow-ups ( α = 5 %). One restoration was considered clinically unacceptable due to loss<symptom> of retention<symptom> after 6 months in the FS group. FS presented statistically high scores for surface roughness when compared to FB after 1 year ( p < 0.05) , but both were considered clinically acceptable. After 1 year , the frequency of clinically unacceptable rates was 3.3 % for anatomical form in the FB group , 1.1 % for retention<symptom> in the FS group , and 2.2 % for marginal adaptation in both groups. All restorations , in both groups , presented score 0 over the 1-year period for marginal staining , postoperative sensitivity , and secondary caries<disease>. Both composite resins showed acceptable clinical performances for the restoration of NCCLs after 1 year. Both bulk-fill flowable and regular nanofilled composites showed good clinical performances for the restoration of NCCLs after 1 year.
