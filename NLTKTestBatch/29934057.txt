 This study was aimed to longitudinally assess memory function and whole-brain memory circuit reorganization in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE) by comparing activation potentials before versus after anterior temporal lobe ( ATL) resection. Nineteen patients with medically-intractable TLE ( 10 left TLE , 9 right<symptom> TLE) and 15 healthy controls were enrolled. Group analyses were conducted pre- and post-ATL of a novelty complex scene-encoding paradigm comparing areas of blood oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD) signal activations on functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI). None of the pre-operative patient characteristics we studied predicted the extent of pre- to post-operative memory<symptom> loss<symptom>. On fMRI , extra-temporal activations were detected pre-operatively in both LTLE and RTLE , particularly in the frontal lobe. Greater activations also were noted in the contralateral hippocampus and parahippocampus in both groups. Performing within-subject comparisons , post-op relative to pre-op , pronounced ipsilateral activations were identified in the left parahippocampal gyrus in LTLE , versus the right middle temporal gyrus in RTLE patients. Memory function was impaired pre-operatively but declined after ATL resection in both RTLE and LTLE patients. Post-operative fMRI results indicate possible functional adaptations to ATL loss , primarily occurring within the left parahippocampal gyrus versus right<symptom> middle temporal gyrus in LTLE versus RTLE patients , respectively.
