 Chronic psychological stress is associated with accelerated biological aging , immune dysfunction , and premature morbidity and mortality. Changes in the relative proportions of T cell subpopulations are thought to be a characteristic of immunological aging; however , understanding of whether these changes are associated with chronic psychological stress is incomplete. This study investigated associations between chronic caregiving stress and distributions of T cell phenotypes in a sample of high stress mothers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ( caregivers; n = 91) and low stress mothers of neurotypical children ( controls; n = 88). Immune markers assessed were naïve ( CD45RA + CD62L +) , central memory ( CD45RA-CD62L +) , and effector memory ( CD45RA-CD62L-) CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. We also examined the ratio of effector to naïve ( E: N) CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. In models adjusted for age , body mass index , race/ethnicity , and antidepressant use , caregivers displayed higher percentages of effector memory CD8 + and CD4 + T cells as well as lower percentages of naïve CD8 + T cells and central memory CD8 + and CD4 + T cells compared to controls. Caregivers also displayed significantly higher E: N ratios for both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. These findings were also independent of cytomegalovirus<pathogen> infection<disease> status<symptom>. Furthermore , higher parental stress , across both groups , was related to several immune parameters. These findings provide preliminary evidence that chronic parental caregiving stress is associated with changes in relative proportions of T cell subpopulations that are consistent with accelerated immunological aging.
