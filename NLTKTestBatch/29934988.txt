 Community psychology is central to understanding how immigrants and more established residents of their new settings join together to develop a shared sense of community and membership. In our present study , we explored how newer ( i.e. , first- and second-generation immigrants) and more established community members form multiple positive psychological sense of community ( PSOC) with one another. We conducted a multinational , qualitative study of PSOC through interviews with 201 first- and second-generation immigrants and third generation or more `` receiving community members '' in three contexts ( Baltimore-Washington corridor of the U.S.; Torino , Italy; Lecce , Italy). Results indicated numerous similarities among the ways in which participants constructed PSOC in shared and nonshared communities , regardless of immigration/citizenship status<symptom> , length of community residence , city , country , age , or gender. Small , proximal , and salient communities were often particularly important to building positive PSOC , which was formed around diverse membership boundaries. As intersectional beings , members converged and diverged on many characteristics , providing multiple opportunities for members to bring diversity to their communities while sharing other characteristics deemed essential to membership. Nonetheless , findings point to significant , structural challenges rooted in power and privilege that must be confronted to bridge the community-diversity dialectic and build strong , shared sense of community.
