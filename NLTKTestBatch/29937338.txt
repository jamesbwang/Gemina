 The proximally based medial plantar flap is considered to be the reference standard for heel reconstruction. Although less well-studied , a distally based medial plantar flap is a suitable alternative when used to cover a distal foot defect , especially of the hallux , first metatarsal , or metatarsophalangeal joint. Our objective was to provide a complete description and propose a classification of the different surgical procedures used to harvest this flap. A review of the data reported in the MEDLINE database until May 2017 concerning the distally based medial plantar flap was performed. We have illustrated the different surgical procedures through a case series. Three approaches or `` types '' of flap have been described , and we have proposed a classification for reconstructive surgeons. In type 1 , the plantar pedicle is ligatured before division into the medial and lateral plantar artery. In type 2 , the medial plantar pedicle is cut proximally just after division. In type 3 , the flap is harvested to include the fasciocutaneous perforator vessels , as an advancement flap or a propeller perforator flap. A distally based medial plantar flap affords adequate and reliable coverage of the weightbearing zone. Because the donor site drawbacks are minimal , this flap is a useful option for distal foot reconstruction , and reconstructive surgeons should remember this flap. The type 1 flap appears to be associated with a minimal risk of flap necrosis<symptom> , even in those with diabetes or arteriopathy , and can cover even the most distal defect.
