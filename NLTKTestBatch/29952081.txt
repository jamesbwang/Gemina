 Living organisms produced nanopolymers ( nanobiopolymers for short) , such as nanocellulose , nanochitin , nanosilk , nanobiotch , and microbial nanobiopolymers , having received widely scientific and engineering interests in recent years. Compare with petroleum-based polymers , biopolymers are sustainable and biodegradable. The unique structural features that stem from nanosized effects , such as ultrahigh aspect ratio and length-diameter ratio , further endow nanobiopolymers with high transparence and versatile processability. To fabricate these nanobiopolymers , a variety of mechanical , chemical , and synthetic biology techniques have been developed. The applications of the isolated nanobiopolymers have been extended from polymer fillers into wide emerging high-tech fields , such as biomedical devices , bioplastics , display panels , ultrafiltration membranes<symptom> , energy storage devices and catalytic supports. Accordingly , in the review , we first introduce isolation techniques to fabricate nanocellulose , nanochitin , nanosilk and nanobiotch. Then , we summarized the nanobiopolymers produced from biosynthetic pathway , including microbial polyamides , polysaccharides and polyesters. On the other hand , most of these techniques require high energy consumption and usage of chemical reagents. In this regard , life cycle assessment offered a quantitative route to precisely evaluate and compare environmental benefits of different artificial isolation approaches , which are also summarized in the second section of the review.
