 Temporal and spatial compartmentalization of biological processes is facilitated by tissue-specific uncoupled circadian clocks in plants. However , interactions among tissue-specific circadian clocks have not been well established. The primary objective of this study was to describe both organ-specific circadian behaviors and centralized actions of the root clock. We analyzed transcript accumulation of circadianly-oscillating genes in roots and shoots. Expression of many clock components was different in roots and shoots. In particular , evening-expressed clock components were highly expressed in roots and likely play important roles in oscillation of the root clock. Consistent with this , the root and shoot clocks responded differentially to circadian gene mutations. The root clock was even dampened in gi-2 mutant. Circadian clocks basically oscillate in an organ-specific manner in plants , but the root clock also requires shoot-derived signals for organism-level coordination<symptom> of circadian activity.
