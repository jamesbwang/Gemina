 Ovarian ependymomas are rare glial neoplasms that typically occur in females on their 3rd to 4th decade of life. They are histologically similar to ependymomas of the central nervous system ( CNS) but may have a broader immunophenotype. We describe a 27 year old female who presented to the emergency room with a 3week history of cough<symptom> and shortness of breath. Further workup disclosed a left pelvic mass and extensive intra-abdominal metastases. Pathology revealed sheets of monomorphic cells within a fibrillary stroma , papillary projections , true ependymal rosettes , and pseudorosettes consistent with an ependymoma of ovarian origin. Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS) showed ATRX and NF2 copy number losses<symptom>. Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) for EWSR1 demonstrated monosomy of 22q in greater than 90 % of cells. These molecular alterations have not been previously reported in ovarian or extra-CNS ependymomas.
