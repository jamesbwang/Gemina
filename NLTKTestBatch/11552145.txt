 Salivary changes and proliferation of specific bacterial communities are known to result in oral disease<disease> which may adversely impact on systemic conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases<disease>. This study reports on the changes in oral ecology of healthy and diseased adults and the possible role in disease<disease> causation. The study comprised 150 participants divided into control ( healthy) , diabetic and cardiac groups. After dental examination for ( Decayed Missing Filled Teeth ( DMFT) and Oral Rating Index ( ORI) , stimulated saliva was sampled to determine flow rate and buffering capacity. Salivary microbial load of DMFT , ORI , buffering capacity and flow rate were inferior for both diabetic and cardiac patients , who had higher bacterial counts ( p < 0.05). Long standing diabetics harboured a higher load of Disruption in the salivary environment and<symptom> changes<symptom> in microbial ecology with increased load of cariogenic bacteria<pathogen> were found in diabetic and cardiac patients. This study brings forward new evidence of a markedly higher load of
