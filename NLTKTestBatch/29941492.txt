 Activation of adaptive response to cellular stress orchestrated by heat shock<symptom> factor 1 ( HSF1) , which is an evolutionary conserved transcriptional regulator of chaperone response and cellular bioenergetics in diverse model systems , is a central feature of organismal defense from environmental and cellular stress. HSF1 activity induced by proteostatic , metabolic and growth factor signals , is regulated by post-transcriptional modifications , yet the mechanisms , which regulate HSF1 and particularly the functional significance of these modifications in modulating its biological activity
