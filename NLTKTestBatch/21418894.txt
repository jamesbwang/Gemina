 Poststroke cognitive impairment is one of the most common complications in stroke survivors , and > 65 % of these patients suffer from cognitive impairment at 12 months following onset , which strongly affects the rehabilitation of their motor function and quality of life. Therefore , it is important to improve the cognitive ability of stroke survivors. As an important component of traditional Chinese Qigong exercises , characterised by the coordination<symptom> of mind and body with a low exercise intensity , Baduanjin has the potential benefit of improving cognitive ability for patients who had a stroke with cognitive impairment. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of Baduanjin training on the cognitive function of stroke survivors. This study is designed as a randomised , two-arm parallel controlled trial with allocation concealment and assessors blinding. A total of 48 participants will be recruited and randomly allocated into the Baduanjin exercise intervention or control group. Baduanjin intervention will last 24 weeks with a frequency of 3 days a week and 40 min a day. Global cognitive function and the specific domains of cognition ( ie , memory , processing speed , execution , attention and visuospatial ability) will be measured at baseline , 8 , 16 and , 24 weeks after intervention and after an additional 4-week follow-up period , while the motor function and quality of life will be measured at baseline , 24 weeks after intervention and after an additional 4-week follow-up period. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Subsidiary Rehabilitation Hospital ( approval number: 2016KY-022-01). The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and at scientific conferences. ChiCTR-INR-16009364; Pre-results.
