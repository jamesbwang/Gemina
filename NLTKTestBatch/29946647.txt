 The present study was aimed to clinically evaluate transitional treatment of pulpitis during pregnancy. Sixty pregnant women with pulpitis were divided into the first , second and third trimester. They were anesthetized locally using STA system combined with psychological intervention during treatment. The teeth were given one-appointment root canal preparation and filled with vitapex pasta. Normal obturation of the root canal was conducted after delivery. The effects of dental treatment , pregnancy outcomes and neonatal health status<symptom> were observed. Data of the survey were analyzed by SPSS 20.0 software package , including Student 's t test and chi-square test. The symptoms<symptom> of pulpitis were significantly improved 24h after treatment , and the effective rate was 96.7 %. The difference of VAS before and after treatment was statistically significant ( P < 0.05). Patients had no discomfort till the end of pregnancy , and the success rate was 98.3 %. No adverse pregnancy outcomes were observed after treatment during different periods of pregnancy. Neonatal health was good. Significant differences were not found in birth gestational age , body<symptom> weight<symptom> , malformations , and neonatal complications between three treatment periods ( P > 0.05). Transitional treatment of pulpitis during pregnancy is a safe and effective procedure and worthy of wide use clinically.
