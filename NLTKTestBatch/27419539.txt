 A 60-year-old male presented with a 6-month-old history of a left upper lid mass. The mass was excised , and histopathological evaluation showed a well-circumscribed , multinodular , intradermal tumor consisting of round-to-oval cells with round nuclei and mucin filled cysts<disease><symptom>. On immunohistochemical analysis , the tumor cells stained positively for cytokeratin ( CK) -7 , CK-8 , estrogen receptor ( ER) , progesterone receptor ( PR) , mucicarmine , synaptophysin , gross cystic disease<disease> fluid protein-15 ( GCDFP-15) , and neuron-specific enolase ( NSE). A diagnosis of endocrine mucin-producing sweat<symptom> gland carcinoma ( EMPSGC) of the eyelid was made and at 6-month follow-up , no recurrence was noted. In this communication , we discuss the pathology and treatment options of EMPSGC of the eyelid. Although an uncommon entity , EMPSGC may be considered as a differential when encountered with a suspicious , potentially malignant eyelid mass.
