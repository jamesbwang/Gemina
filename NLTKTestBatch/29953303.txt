 To report a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada ( VKH) disease<disease> associated with hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> vaccination. Case report. A 43-year-old Caucasian male presented with a three-week history of blurry vision , pain , photophobia<symptom> , and redness in both eyes. Three days prior to the onset of symptoms<symptom> , he had received the hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> vaccine. Clinical evaluation revealed multifocal placoid lesions<symptom> in the posterior pole , choroidal thickening , and serous macular detachment. Targeted laboratory investigations were negative for infectious or autoimmune markers. After treatment with oral corticosteroids , the patient had resolution of symptoms<symptom> with near-total recovery of visual function. The patient later reported systemic findings of hearing loss , tinnitus<symptom> , and integumentary changes. A diagnosis of VKH disease<disease> was made and inflammation was managed with oral corticosteroids followed by methotrexate for long-term disease<disease> control. VKH disease<disease> is an inflammatory condition primarily affecting the choroid , retinal pigment epithelium , and outer retina. The underlying etiology is unclear , but it can be associated with a viral prodrome suggesting an infectious trigger in a genetically susceptible individual. Our case suggests that hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> vaccination may trigger a similar inflammatory response.
