 Laparoscopic greater curvature plication ( LGP) has recently emerged as a new bariatric procedure. This surgery provides gastric restriction without resection , which could potentially provide a lower risk alternative , with fewer complications. The real benefit of this technique in the short and long term is unknown. This systematic review aims to compare laparoscopic gastric plication and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for obesity treatment. Clinical trials were identified in MEDLINE , Embase , Cochrane , LILACS , BVS , SCOPUS , and CINAHL databases. Comparison of LGP and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( SG) included hospital stay , operative time , loss of hunger feeling , body mass index loss ( BMIL) , percentage of excess weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( % EWL) , complications , symptoms<symptom> in the postoperative period , and comorbidity remission or improvement. This systematic review search included 17,423 records. Eight studies were selected for meta-analysis. There is no difference in operative time , hospital stay , and complications. Patients in the SG group had improved loss of hunger feeling. BMIL was better in the SG group at 12 and 24 months ( mean difference ( MD)- 2.19 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI)- 3.10 to- 1.28 , and MD- 4.59 , 95 % CI- 5.55 to- 3.63 , respectively). SG showed improved % EWL compared with gastric plication in 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months. However , no difference was found in % EWL long-term results ( 24 and 36 months). Patients who underwent LGP had more sialorrhea. SG showed better results in diabetes remission. SG showed improved weight<symptom> loss<symptom> when compared with LGP , with better satiety , fewer symptoms<symptom> in the postoperative period , and improved diabetes remission.
