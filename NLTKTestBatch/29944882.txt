 Non-typeable Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen> ( NTHi) is a human-adapted bacterial pathogen , responsible for infections<disease> of the human respiratory<disease> tract<symptom>. This pathogen expresses a range of adhesins that mediate binding to host cells. Most NTHi strains can express the related adhesins HMW1 and HMW2. Expression of HMW proteins is phase-variable: changes in the length of simple-sequence repeats located in the encoding genes promoter regions results in changes in expression levels of these adhesins. HMW expression is also controlled by epigenetic regulation. HMW1 has been previously demonstrated to bind Î± 2-3 sialyl-lactosamine , but affinity of this interaction has not been investigated. The host receptor ( s) for HMW2 is currently unknown. We hypothesized that host glycans may act as receptors for HMW2-mediated adherence. We examined the glycan-binding activity of HMW2 using glycan arrays and Surface Plasmon Resonance ( SPR). These studies demonstrate that HMW2 binds 2-6 linked N-acetylneuraminic acid with high affinity. HMW2 did not bind glycan structures containing the non-human form of sialic acid , N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Thus , the specificity of HMW1 and HMW2 have complementary lectin activities that may allow NTHi distinct niches in the human host.
