 Clinically , erythropoietin ( EPO) is known to increase systemic vascular resistance and arterial blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. However , EPO stimulates the production of the potent vasodilator , nitric oxide ( NO) , in culture endothelial cells. The mechanism by which EPO causes vasoconstriction despite stimulating NO production may be dependent on its ability to activate two receptor complexes , the homodimeric EPO ( EPOR
