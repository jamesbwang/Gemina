 Obstetric hemorrhage<symptom> is one of the leading , as well as one of the most treatable , causes of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. As obstetric hemorrhage<symptom> often occurs in patients without risk factors , there is virtually unanimous agreement from obstetric professional societies to establish obstetric hemorrhage<symptom> protocols in anticipation of these emergencies. These protocols involve multidisciplinary teams in which the transfusion service plays an essential and vital role. This manuscript will examine the epidemiology of obstetric hemorrhage<symptom> , risk factors that may be present , and recommendations for these protocols , with a focus on massive transfusion protocols , laboratory testing , cell salvage and use of pharmacologic adjuvant therapy including tranexamic acid and factor concentrates.
