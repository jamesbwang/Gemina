 RVM ON- and OFF cells are thought to facilitate and inhibit spinal nociceptive transmission , respectively. However , it is unknown how ON and OFF cells respond to pruritic stimuli or how they contribute to descending modulation of spinal itch signaling. In pentobarbital-anesthetized mice , single-unit recordings were made in RVM from ON and OFF cells identified by their respective increase or decrease in firing that occurred just prior to nocifensive hindlimb withdrawal<symptom> elicited by paw pinch. Of RVM ON cells , 75 % ( 21/28) were excited by intradermal ( id) histamine , 50 % ( 10/20) by id chloroquine , and 75 % ( 27/36) by id capsaicin. Most chemically-responsive units also responded to a scratch stimulus applied to the injected hindpaw. Few ON cells responded to id injection of vehicle ( saline: 5/32; Tween 2/17) , but still responded to scratching. For OFF cells , id histamine and scratching inhibited 32 % ( 6/19) with no effect of histamine in the remainder. Id chloroquine inhibited 44 % ( 4/9) and id capsaicin inhibited 61 % ( 11/18) of OFF cells. Few OFF cells were affected by vehicles ( Tween: 1 inhibited , 7 unaffected; saline: 3 excited , 1 inhibited , 8 unaffected). Both ON and OFF cells that responded to one chemical usually also responded to others , while units unresponsive to the first-tested chemical tended not to respond to others. These results indicate that ascending pruriceptive signals activate RVM ON cells and inhibit RVM OFF cells. These effects are considered to facilitate and disinhibit spinal pain transmission , respectively. It is currently not clear if spinal itch transmission is similarly modulated.
