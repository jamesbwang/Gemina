 The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Pycnogenol ® supplementation in terms of safety and tolerability in the setting of preclinical or borderline , initial symptoms<symptom> of benign prostatic hyperthrophy ( BPH) , in otherwise healthy subjects , using Pycnogenol ® over a period of 60 days. Seventy-five healthy men with symptoms<symptom> and signs of initial BPH were included. The subjects were divided into three groups: 1) control group using only the standard management ( SM); 2) a group using SM plus Pycnogenol ® 150 mg/day; 3) a group using standard pharmacological management. BPH symptoms<symptom> like emptying , frequency , intermittency , urgency , weak flow , straining , nocturia , were all significantly improved with Pycnogenol ® ( P < 0.05) and the difference with both control groups was statistically significant ( P < 0.05). Pycnogenol ® may be an important option for self-management of BPH in otherwise healthy men.
