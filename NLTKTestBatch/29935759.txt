 To investigate demographic , epidemiologic and psychiatric features suggestive of the coexistence epilepsy ( ES) and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures<symptom> ( PNES) that may contribute to precocious suspicion of the association. In this exploratory study , all patients older than 16 years admitted to prolonged video-electroencephalogram monitoring were evaluated about demographic , epileptological and psychiatric features. Detailed psychiatric assessment using M.I.N.I.-plus 5.0 , Beck Anxiety<symptom> Inventory , Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire ( CTQ) was performed. Data were collected previous to the final diagnosis and patients with ES-only , PNES-only or coexistence of ES/PNES were compared. Of 122 patients admitted to epilepsy monitoring unit , 86 patients were included and 25 ( 29 %) had PNES. Twelve ( 14 %) had PNES-only , 13 ( 15 %) had ES/PNES and the remaining 61 ( 71 %) had only ES. A coexistence of ES and PNES was associated with clinical report of more than one seizure<symptom> type ( pË‚0 .001) , nonspecific white matter hyperintensities on MRI ( p < .001) and a past of psychotic disorder ( p = .005). In addition , these patients had significantly more emotional abuse and neglect ( p < .002 and 0.001 , respectively). Somatization ( including conversion disorder) was the most common diagnosis in patients with PNES- only ( 83 %) and co-existing of PNES and ES ( 69.2 %) , differentiating both from ES-only patients ( p < .001). The high prevalence of this coexistence ES/PNES in this study reinforces a need to properly investigate PNES , especially in patients with confirmed ES who become refractory to medical treatment with antiepileptic drugs. The neuropsychiatric assessment may help to diagnostic suspicion and in the planning of therapeutic interventions.
