 Hypotension<symptom> or low<symptom> blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) is a common problem in preterm neonates and has been associated with adverse short and long-term neurological outcomes. Deciding when and whether to treat hypotension<symptom> relies on an understanding of the relationship between BP and brain functioning. This study aims to investigate the interaction ( coupling) between BP and continuous multichannel unedited EEG recordings in preterm infants less than 32 weeks of gestational age. The EEG was represented by spectral power in four frequency sub-bands: 0.3-3 Hz , 3-8 Hz , 8-15 Hz and 15-30 Hz. BP was represented as mean arterial pressure ( MAP). The level of coupling between the two physiological systems was estimated using linear and nonlinear methods such as correlation , coherence and mutual information. Causality of interaction was measured using transfer entropy. The illness severity was represented by the clinical risk index for babies ( CRIB II score) and contrasted to the computed level of interaction. It is shown here that correlation and coherence , which are linear measures of the coupling between EEG and MAP , do not correlate with CRIB values , whereas adjusted mutual information , a nonlinear measure , is associated with CRIB scores ( r = -0.57 , p = 0.003). Mutual information is independent of the absolute values of MAP and EEG powers and quantifies the level of coupling between the short-term dynamics in both signals. The analysis indicated that the dominant causality is from changes in EEG producing changes in MAP. Transfer entropy ( EEG to MAP) is associated with the CRIB score ( 0.3-3 Hz: r = 0.428 , p = 0.033 , 3-8 Hz: r = 0.44 , p = 0.028 , 8-15 Hz: r = 0.416 , p = 0.038) and indicates that a higher level of directed coupling from brain activity to blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> is associated with increased illness in preterm infants. This is the first study to present the nonlinear measure of interaction between brain activity and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and to demonstrate its relation to the initial illness severity in the preterm infant. The obtained results allow us to hypothesise that the normal wellbeing of a preterm neonate can be characterised by a nonlinear coupling between brain activity and MAP , whereas the presence of weak coupling with distinctive directionality of information flow is associated with an increased mortality rate in preterms.
