 Short foetal femur length ( FL) is a normal variant but may also be a marker for disorders such as skeletal dysplasia , Trisomy 21 ( T21) , Turners syndrome<symptom> , congenital infection<disease> ( TORCH) and foetal growth restriction ( FGR). Our aim was to review outcomes in our population following a diagnosis of isolated short FL ( FL < 5th centile) when detected at the time of mid trimester foetal anomaly scan ( FAS). All women within NHS Tayside who attended for routine mid trimester foetal anomaly scan at 18-21 weeks gestation ( Range = 18 72 women were identified. The median maternal age was 30 years ( range = 17-45 years). 39/72 ( 54.2 %) women were primigravid. 41/72 ( 56.9 %) women had Down 's syndrome<symptom> screening ( DSS). 12/72 ( 16.7 %) women were offered TORCH screens , none of which were positive for recent or current infection<disease>. Invasive testing was performed in 8/72 ( 11 %) women; 1 had previously had first trimester chorionic villus sampling ( CVS) for raised maternal age. 7 women had amniocentesis ( 1 prior to FAS for increased DSS risk). All those that had invasive testing had normal foetal karyotype. Median gestational age at delivery was 38 weeks ( range = 26-41 weeks). 10/72 ( 13.9 %) had genetic testing after birth , 6 were performed shortly after birth due to dysmorphic features. 4/72 ( 5.5 %) had Trisomy 21 and 3 of these had VSD that had not been identified antenatally. For those with T21 , 3 mothers had declined DSS and 1 had a low risk DSS result. Fifty out of seventy two ( 69.4 %) babies had constitutionally short femurs. 13/72 ( 18 %) had FGR and 3/72 ( 4.2 %) had skeletal dysplasia. One baby had William 's syndrome<symptom> , one had Klinefelter syndrome<symptom> and two had genetic deletions of uncertain significance. Knowledge of outcomes will enable better counselling for women with isolated short foetal femur. In our local population , more than two-thirds of the babies with isolated short femur will be normal. Women must , however , be informed of the potential for foetal aneuploidy and foetal skeletal dysplasia. In view of this , women should be offered invasive testing and follow-up ultrasound scans to assess the foetal skeleton. Furthermore isolated short foetal femur is a marker for FGR and all women with isolated short femur should be offered serial ultrasound scans to assess foetal growth and well-being in the third trimester.
