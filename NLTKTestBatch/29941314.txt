 This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the high shear rate of flow in the area of carotid stenosis is associated with the incidence of ischemic symptoms<symptom> in patients with a high degree of carotid stenosis. This is a case-control study of patients with > 70 % stenosis of the internal carotid artery ( ICA) identified by duplex ultrasound in an Intersocietal Accreditation Commission-accredited laboratory during 1 year. Symptomatic patients were included in the study group , and asymptomatic patients served as controls. Shear rates were calculated from high-resolution ultrasound images. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to account for confounding factors. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare diagnostic values of shear rate , velocities , and diameters of the ICA. The study included 308 patients ( 55.5 % male; mean age , 73 Â± 10 years); 209 of them were asymptomatic and 99 were symptomatic. The mean shear rate was 7930 s In patients with > 70 % ICA stenosis , the shear rate is associated with the prevalence of symptomatic cerebrovascular ischemic events. A shear rate of 8000 s
