 Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB) may increase the risk of postoperative complications in patients after cardiac surgery. This study evaluated the length of hospital stay as well as postoperative cardiac , respiratory , and renal complications after elective coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) in patients without SDB , with central sleep apnea ( CSA) , or with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA). The presence and type of SDB had been assessed with polygraphic recordings in 100 patients the night before elective CABG surgery. SDB was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI) of ≥ 15/h. Prolonged length of hospital stay ( LOS) and postoperative hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> due to any cause were retrospectively evaluated as primary endpoints and cardiac , respiratory , and renal complications as secondary endpoints. 37 % of patients had SDB , 14 % CSA , and 23 % OSA. LOS differed significantly between patients without SDB and those with CSA and OSA ( median ( 25; 75. percentile): 8.0 days ( 7.5; 11.0) vs. 9.5 days ( 7.0; 12.5) vs. 12.0 days ( 9.0; 17.0) , Kruskal-Wallis test between three groups: p = 0.023; OSA vs. no SDB: p = 0.005). AHI was significantly associated with prolonged LOS ( > 9 days; odds ratio ( OR) ( 95 % confidence interval): 1.047 ( 1.001; 1.095) , p = 0.044). Prolonged need of vasopressors ( ≥ 48 h) was observed in 36 % of patients without SDB , in 64 % with CSA , and in 62 % with OSA ( p = 0.037). AHI was significantly associated with prolonged ( ≥ 48 h) need of vasopressors ( OR ( 95 % CI): 1.052 ( 1.002; 1.104) , p = 0.040) , independent of any confounders. SDB , particularly OSA , is associated with prolonged LOS after CABG , independent of known confounders. Prolonged LOS in patients with SDB may be due to increased postoperative hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> due to any cause.
