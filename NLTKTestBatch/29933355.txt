J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of caffeine on an upper-body resistance exercise workout. Fifteen men ( mean ± SD: age , 23.1 ± 1.9 years; body mass , 89.1 ± 13.9 kg; height , 175 ± 6.1 cm) volunteered to come to the laboratory 3 times. During visit 1 , 1-repetition maximum ( RM) values were determined for the barbell bench press , incline barbell bench press , and dumbbell bench press exercises. For visit 2 , subjects consumed either 800-mg caffeine or a placebo. Subjects then completed 3 sets to failure<symptom> of each exercise using 80 % of their 1RM. Visit 3 was the same as visit 2; however , participants consumed the opposite treatment as visit 2. Various perceptual measures were recorded before , during , and after the workouts. The results indicated that participants completed significantly more repetitions per set for the barbell bench press ( 4.80 ± 2.66) and incline barbell bench press ( 4.91 ± 2.29) in the caffeine condition compared with the placebo condition ( 4.42 ± 2.56 and 4.36 ± 2.11 , respectively). Higher arousal scores were found in the caffeine condition. For vigor , participants reported higher scores with caffeine before warming up ( caffeine = 10.20 ± 4.11 , placebo = 6.20 ± 3.23) and mid workout ( caffeine = 13.53 ± 2.29 , placebo = 11.13 ± 2.79). These results suggest that caffeine has an ergogenic effect on strength workout performance due , at least in part , to positive effects on workout perception. Athletes and recreational lifters may want to consider the ingestion of caffeine before a resistance exercise workout.
