 Simple metabolites released during physical exercise and fasting like lactate ( Lac) and β-hydroxybutyrate ( BHB) have recently been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. However , the effects of these metabolites in immune mediated hepatitis<pathogen> are still unknown. Accordingly , we investigated the role of Lac , BHB and their combination on experimentally induced hepatic inflammation. Adult male mice were administered concanavalin A ( Con A , 15 mg/kg , intravenous) for 12 h. In the treatment groups , mice were treated 1 h after Con A-intoxication with Lac ( 500 mg/kg , intraperitoneal) , BHB ( 300 mg/kg , intraperitoneal) and their combination. The results demonstrated that Lac and BHB , especially when combined together , alleviated Con A-induced hepatocellular injury ( ALT , AST and LDH) and necrosis<symptom> ( hematoxylin-eosin and electron microscopy). These beneficial effects correlated with attenuating Con A-induced elevation in hepatic oxidative stress parameters ( MDA and NOx). Mechanistically , administration of Lac and BHB led to inhibition of Con A-induced phosphorylation of JNK and AMPK proteins in the liver to the same extent. These effects were concordant with curbing Con A-mediated overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α , IL-6 and IL-12 and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. The marked anti-inflammatory properties of combining Lac and BHB were attributed to their cooperation in repressing immune cells ( monocytes and neutrophils) infiltration to the liver. Unlike BHB , Lac administration markedly induced the reparative STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation in the livers of Con A-intoxicated mice at the early time point. In conclusion , the simultaneous use of Lac and BHB might be an auspicious strategy for limiting immune mediated hepatitis<pathogen>.
