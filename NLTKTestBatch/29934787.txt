 For human beings , monitoring others ' errors is essential for efficient goal-directed behavior. Indeed , the mere observation of other individuals ' errors provides a rich source of information that can be used to avoid potential errors and improve our performance without direct experience. Recent studies have outlined that vicarious experience of errors influences the observer 's overt behavior. This observational posterror slowing ( oPES) is supposed to reflect a strategic increase in control aimed at reducing the probability of an error. Because the consequences of error observation have been exclusively investigated by means of arbitrary button-press responses , which limit the investigation to premovement processes , it is unclear whether the observation of an error also influences the online control of goal-directed actions. In the present study , for the first time , we investigated the effect of error observation on the reach-to-grasp movement by means of kinematical analysis. The results revealed that error-observation effects are not confined to premovement processes-they also strategically affect spatial movement trajectories. Our findings add substantially to previous literature , showing that the oPES spreads to movement<symptom> execution when a more realistic , ecologically valid task is employed.
