 Cerebral ischemia is a common neurological disease<disease> , and its pathological process remains elusive. This study focused on the protective mechanism of Apelin-12 protein on the nervous system of mice during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through JNK and P38MAPK signaling pathway. The mouse model with an ischemia-reperfusion injury in middle cerebral artery was prepared by the modified thread-occlusion method and divided into 4 groups randomly. Before implantation of the mice , we assessed the neurological function and evaluated the cerebral edema<symptom> by the wet-dry weight<symptom> method. Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) kit was used to assess the degree of cell injury. Malondialdehyde ( MDA) kit was used to measure the level of neuron MDA. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the neuronal cell in the ischemic brain. Protein expressions of JNK and P38MAPK and apoptosis-related molecules , including Bax , Bcl-2 , caspase-3 , and cleaved caspase-3 , were measured by Western blot assay. After focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion , a significant decrease in neurobehavioral score , brain edema<symptom> and neuron injury in mice occurred. Apelin-12 significantly improved the neurobehavioral score of the mice with ischemia-reperfusion injury , alleviated brain edema<symptom> and the damage to neurons. In addition , Apelin-12 inhibited the morphological changes and apoptosis of neuronal cells in the ischemic penumbra of mice. Apelin-12 could downregulate the expression of Bax and caspase-3 , inhibit the activity of caspase-3 and upregulate the expression of Bcl-2 , an anti-apoptotic protein. A significant reduction in the protein expression of p-JNK and p-p38 was observed in the Apelin-12 group compared with that in the I/R or Vehicle group ( p < 0.05). When an ischemia-reperfusion injury occurred , Apelin-12 can inhibit the JNK and P38MAPK signaling pathway of the apoptosis-related MAPKs family , thus offering protection to neurons.
