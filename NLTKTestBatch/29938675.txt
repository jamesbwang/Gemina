 Given the fact that oxidative stress response induced by training/detraining has still not been clarified and may be influenced by gender , the aim of our investigation was to compare the effects of swimming training and detraining on oxidative and antioxidative parameters in rats , with a special focus on sex differences. Wistar albino rats ( n = 64) were divided into 4 groups: control , trained group , groups exposed to 2 and 4 weeks of detraining. Each group included two subgroups: males and females. After sacrificing , hearts<symptom> were isolated and retrogradely perfused according to Langendorff technique. Levels of superoxide anion radical , hydrogen peroxide , nitrites and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were measured in plasma and coronary venous effluent , while reduced glutathione , activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were measured in erythrocytes. Our results indicate that swimming training does n't promote oxidative damage , nor act protectively within the heart. However , 2 and 4 weeks of detraining led to a partial lost in exercise-induced adaptation. It seems that moderate-intensity physical exercise of sufficient duration leads to beneficial adaptations , which may be partially lost during detraining period. Positive antioxidative effects of training remained longer in males. Findings of present study may help in elucidation of training and detraining effects on modulation of redox homeostasis , especially from aspect of gender differences.
