 Fragile X syndrome<symptom> ( FXS) is the most prevalent inherited intellectual disability , resulting from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein ( FMRP). Patients with FXS suffer lifelong cognitive disabilities , but the function of FMRP in the adult brain and the mechanism underlying age-related cognitive decline in FXS is not fully understood. Here , we report that a loss of FMRP results in increased protein synthesis of histone acetyltransferase EP300 and ubiquitination-mediated degradation of histone deacetylase HDAC1 in adult hippocampal neural stem cells ( NSCs). Consequently , FMRP-deficient NSCs exhibit elevated histone acetylation and age-related NSC depletion , leading to cognitive impairment in mature adult mice. Reducing histone acetylation rescues both neurogenesis and cognitive deficits in mature adult FMRP-deficient mice. Our work reveals a role for FMRP and histone acetylation in cognition and presents a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating adult FXS patients.
