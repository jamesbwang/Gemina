 There are global efforts in developing therapeutic strategies for central nervous system ( CNS) injuries using multimodal approaches. Nogo receptor type 1 ( NgR1) has been known as a primary molecule limiting neuronal regeneration in the adult CNS. We identified lateral olfactory tract<symptom> usher substance ( LOTUS) as an endogenous NgR1 antagonist. Membrane-bound LOTUS interacts with NgR1 and inhibits its function by blocking its ligand binding. Five molecules including Nogo , myelin-associated glycoprotein ( MAG) , oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein ( OMgp) , B lymphocyte<symptom> stimulator ( BLyS) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans ( CSPGs) have been identified as NgR1 ligands. These ligands bind to NgR1 and activate NgR1 signaling , leading to axon growth inhibition such as growth cone collapse and neurite outgrowth inhibition. We have recently reported that the soluble form of LOTUS ( s-LOTUS) also suppressed NgR1-mediated signaling induced by myelin axonal inhibitors ( MAIs) including Nogo , MAG and OMgp by binding with both NgR1 and its co-receptor p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75
