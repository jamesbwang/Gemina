 Hyperhomocysteinemia has been associated with different pathologies , including cardiovascular diseases<disease> , hypertension , diabetes , and breast cancer ( BC). To examine the differences in total homocysteine ( tHcy) plasma levels , we compared healthy women to BC patients from a Mexican population. The tHcy plasma levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector in 89 female controls and 261 BC patients. The observed plasma tHcy levels were significantly higher among the BC patients ( 11.1019 ± 5.9161 µmol/l) compared to the controls ( 9.1046 ± 1.3213 µmol/l) ( p = 0.002) , and these differences were evident when stratified by age ( ≥ 50 years old) , menopause status<symptom> , overweight and obesity , miscarriages , node metastases , progression , subtype classification ( luminal , Her2 and triple negative) and nonresponse to chemotherapy. The tHcy plasma levels could be a good marker for the progression and chemosensitivity of BC in the analyzed sample from a Mexican population.
