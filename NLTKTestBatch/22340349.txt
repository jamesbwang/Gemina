 Osteoid osteoma is an uncommon benign tumor and causes severe<symptom> pain<symptom> , being worse at night , that responds dramatically to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. An osteoid osteoma of the patella is very rare and if it arise close to chondral surface differential diagnosis may be challenging. In three patients the osteoid osteoma was completely excised by nidus removal by mosaicoplasty set with open surgical technique. The patients were followed up in average for 31 ( 16-48 months) months with annual clinical and radiographic evaluations. There were no relapse of the pain and no residual recurrent tumor. The aim of the treatment for osteoid osteoma is to remove entire nidus by open surgical excision or by percutaneous procedures such as percutaneous radiofrequency and laser ablation. Mosaicoplasty is a good alternative for treatment of osteoid osteoma of the patella in the subchondral bone.
