 There are few cases in the literature reporting dysphagia<symptom> caused by oesophageal compression by the aorta due to acute or chronic aortic pathology. This type of dysphagia<symptom> is called dysphagia<symptom> aortica. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is nowadays the treatment of choice for anatomically suitable patients experiencing complicated Type B aortic dissection. Oesophageal necrosis<symptom> is a rare but fatal complication following thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Extrinsic oesophageal compression by the thrombosed aneurysmal sac , a mediastinal haematoma or extensive thrombosis in the false lumen of a dissected aorta and acute vascular occlusion of the oesophageal supply are possible mechanisms. When oesophageal necrosis<symptom> is suspected , endoscopic examination and computed tomography imaging should be performed repeatedly. Oesophagoscopy will confirm the diagnosis revealing a black , diffusely necrotic and ulcerated oesophageal mucosa<pathogen>. It is critical to intervene before full-thickness oesophageal wall necrosis<symptom> and mediastinitis<disease> occur. Guidelines are absent because of the rarity of this complication. Moreover , lack of a large series does not permit the establishment of guidelines either. However , oesophagectomy of the impaired oesophagus is the only chance for survival. Unfortunately , survival rates are disappointing. Prevention and awareness is the cornerstone of success. Early endoscopic examination when oesophageal necrosis<symptom> is suspected due to even minimal symptoms<symptom> will detect this fatal menace on time.
