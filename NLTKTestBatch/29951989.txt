 Freeze tolerance is an adaptive response utilized by the wood frog Rana sylvatica to endure the sub-zero temperatures of winter. Survival of whole body freezing requires wood frogs to trigger cryoprotective mechanisms to deal with potential injuries associated with conversion of 65-70 % of total body water into ice , including multiple consequences of ice formation such as cessation of blood flow and cell dehydration<symptom> caused by water loss into ice masses. To understand how wood frogs defend against these stressors , we measured the expression of proteins known to be involved in the antioxidant defense and protein chaperone stress responses in brain and heart of wood frogs comparing freezing , anoxia , and dehydration<symptom> stress. Our results showed that most stress proteins were regulated in a tissue- and stress-specific manner. Notably , protein levels of the cytosolic superoxide dismutase ( SOD1) were upregulated by 1.37 ± 0.11-fold in frozen brain , whereas the mitochondrial SOD2 isoform rose by 1.38 ± 0.37-fold in the heart during freezing. Catalase protein levels were upregulated by 3.01 ± 0.47-fold in the brain under anoxia stress , but remained unchanged in the heart. Similar context-specific regulatory patterns were also observed for the heat shock<symptom> protein ( Hsp) molecular chaperones. Hsp27 protein was down-regulated in the brain across the three stress conditions , whereas the mitochondrial Hsp60 was upregulated in anoxic brain by 1.73 ± 0.38-fold and by 2.13 ± 0.57-fold in the frozen heart. Overall , our study provides a snapshot of the regulatory expression of stress proteins in wood frogs under harsh environment conditions and shows that they are controlled in a tissue- and stress-specific manner.
