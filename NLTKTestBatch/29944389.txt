 We have reported that hypertrophic adipocytes release extracellular vesicles ( EVs) and that number of circulating adipocyte-derived EVs correlated with insulin and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) in a pilot study using obese patients. Here , we explored the association between circulating EV level and various metabolic parameters , including obesity and lipid and glucose metabolisms among 203 subjects ( 76 men , 127 women; median age , 54 years) with or without risk factor for metabolic diseases<disease> , who received a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT). Circulating EV number was significantly higher in men than in women ( p < 0.001). Circulating EV number in individuals with impaired OGTT pattern was significantly higher compared to those with normal OGTT pattern ( p < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that circulating EV number correlated most strongly and significantly with elevated triglyceride ( TG) ( t = 8.55 , p < 0.001). Additionally , circulating EV number correlated significantly with homeostasis model assessment-beta cell function ( HOMA-β) ( t = 2.38 , p < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed the cut off value of EV numbers in individuals with elevated serum TG levels ( ≧ 150mg/dL) was identified ( 136,738 EVs/μl of plasma , p < 0.001 , sensitivity 0.842 , false positive rate 0.257). Perilipin and asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 were detected on a part of isolated circulating EVs , indicating EV release from adipocytes and hepatocytes , which were related to lipid and glucose metabolism. Circulating EVs represent a promising metabolic biomarker for lipid and glucose metabolism and have potential for monitoring metabolic status<symptom> in humans , including individuals without metabolic risk factors.
