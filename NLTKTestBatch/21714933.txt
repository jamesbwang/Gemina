 Synovial adipose stem cells ( sASC) can be differentiated into catecholamine-expressing sympathetic neuron-like cells to treat experimental arthritis<disease><symptom>. However , the pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) is known to be toxic to catecholaminergic cells ( see Parkinson disease<disease>) , and this may prevent anti-inflammatory effects in inflamed tissue. We hypothesized that TNF exhibits inhibitory effects on human differentiated sympathetic tyrosine hydroxylase-positive ( TH +) neuron-like cells. For the first time , iTH + neuron-like sympathetic cells were generated from sACSs of rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA) and osteoarthritis ( OA) synovial tissue. Compared to untreated controls in both OA and RA , TNF-treated iTH + cells demonstrated a weaker staining of catecholaminergic markers in cell cultures of RA/OA patients , and the amount of produced noradrenaline was markedly lower. These effects were reversed by etanercept. Exposure of iTH + cells to synovial fluid of RA patients showed similar inhibitory effects. In mixed synovial cells , significant effects of TNF on catecholamine release were observed only in OA. This study shows that TNF inhibits iTH + synovial cells leading to the decrease of secreted noradrenaline. This might be a reason why discovered newly appearing TH + cells in the synovium are not able to develop their possible full anti-inflammatory role in arthritis<disease><symptom>.
