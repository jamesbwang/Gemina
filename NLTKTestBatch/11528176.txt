 The objective of surgery for acetabular fractures is to achieve precise reduction to restore joint congruence , fix internal bone fragments , avoid displacement of the fracture and allow rapid rehabilitation.Open reduction and internal fixation is the benchmark method for displaced acetabular fractures , but open reductions can increase morbidity , causing neurovascular injury , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , heterotopic bone formation , infection<disease> and poor wound<disease> healing.An anatomical reduction with a gap of 2 mm or less is a predictor of good joint function and reduced risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.The percutaneous approach is associated with fewer complications than open techniques , but acetabular geometry makes percutaneous screw insertion a challenging procedure.The percutaneous technique is recommended for non-displaced or slightly displaced fractures , and in obese , osteoporotic and elderly patients who can not receive total joint arthroplasty.We recommend the use of intramedullary cannulated screws.Fracture reductions are achieved by manual traction of the affected bones. If some fracture displacement remains , accessory windows can be used to introduce a ball spike pusher , a hook or a Steinmann pin which can be used as a joystick to rotate the fracture.In this paper , we describe the accessory windows for the anterior column , the quadrilateral plate and the posterior column. We detail the position , direction and kind of screws used to stabilize the anterior and posterior columns. Cite this article:
