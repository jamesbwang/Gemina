 The intercellular binding of desmosomal junctions is mediated by cadherins of the desmoglein ( Dsg) and desmocollin ( Dsc) type. Dsg2 mutant mice with deletion of a substantial segment of the extracellular EC1-EC2 domain , which is believed to participate in homo- and heterophilic desmosomal cadherin interactions , develop cardiac fibrosis<disease> and ventricular dilation. Widening of the intercellular cleft and complete intercalated disc ruptures can be observed in the hearts<symptom> of these mice. Since a reduced litter size of homozygous Dsg2 mutant mice was noted and a functional correlation between desmosomes and embryo implantation has been deduced from animal studies , we looked for an alteration of desmosomes in uterine endometrial epithelium. Shape and number of desmosomes as well as the expression of Dsg2 and the desmosomal plaque protein desmoplakin ( Dsp) were investigated by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in 12 oestrous-dated mice ( 7 wild type and 5 homozygous Dsg2 mutant mice) at the age of 9-17 weeks. The immunohistochemical detection of Dsg2 was diminished in the mutants and the number of desmosomes was significantly reduced as revealed by electron microscopy. In addition , the intercellular desmosomal space measured in electron micrographs was considerably widened in the Dsg2 mutants. The increased intercellular spacing can be explained by the partial deletion of the extracellular EC1-EC2 domain of Dsg2. Whether these changes explain the reduced number of offspring of homozygous Dsg2 mutant mice remains to be further investigated.
