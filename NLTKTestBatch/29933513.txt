 Aura symptoms<symptom> have been reported in up to 23 % of cluster headache<symptom> patients , but it is not known whether clinical characteristics are different in participants with and without aura. Using validated web-based questionnaires we assessed the presence and characteristics of attack-related aura and other clinical features in 629 subjects available for analysis from an initial cohort of 756 cluster headache<symptom> subjects. Participants who screened positive for aura were contacted by telephone for confirmation of the ICHD-III criteria for aura. Typical aura symptoms<symptom> before or during cluster headache<symptom> attacks were found in 44/629 participants ( 7.0 %) mainly involving visual symptoms<symptom> ( 61.4 %). Except for lower alcohol consumption and higher prevalence of frontal<symptom> pain<symptom> in participants with aura , no differences in clinical characteristics were found compared with participants without aura. At least 7.0 % of the participants with cluster headache<symptom> in our large cohort reported typical aura symptoms<symptom> , which most often involved visual symptoms<symptom>. No major clinical differences were found between participants with and without aura.
