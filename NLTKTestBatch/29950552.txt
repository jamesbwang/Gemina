 Osteoporosis is one of chief complications of anorexia<symptom> nervosa. Their calcium intake decreases and 84 % are lack of vitamin D. The abnormal bone metabolism in severely emaciated patients with anorexia<symptom> nervosa involves both a reduction in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption. The annual change in lumbar bone mineral density ( BMD) is significantly correlated with body mass index ( BMI) at the entry. The critical BMI for a positive increase in BMD was 16.4 ± 0.3 kg/m2. Since 30 % of patients are lack of vitamin K , their bone quality deteriorates. The risk factors of a decrease in lumbar vertebrae BMD is a duration of emaciation<symptom> when both serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-Ⅰ as a potent osteogenic factor and estradiol as a powerful bone resorption inhibitor decrease. Therefore , the prevention and the treatment are weight<symptom> gain. However , the patient does not accept weight<symptom> gain easily. Active form vitamin D3 of 0.5 μg/day or 30-45 mg/day of vitamin K2 preparation prevents the further decrease in bone mineral density. Eldecalcitol of 0.5 μg/day shows about 5 % increase in lumbar vertebrae BMD in first year. Bisphosphonate and a RANK ligand inhibitors , denosumab should not be used for young patients and women in hope of the pregnancy.
