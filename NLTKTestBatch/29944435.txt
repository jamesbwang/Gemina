 To investigate the use of electronic patient-reported outcomes ( PROs) to assess symptoms<symptom> and how they can provide opportunities to clinicians to address symptoms<symptom> in a timely manner to improve clinical care. As part of a larger study to evaluate whether providing standardized symptom<symptom> reports to the medical team would decrease the time to treatment of reported symptoms<symptom> in hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients , we assessed nurses ' and providers ' perceptions of electronic symptom<symptom> reporting. Semistructured interviews of RNs , MDs , NPs and PAs were conducted at an academic cancer center in the southeastern United States. Nurses ' and providers ' perceptions of electronic symptom<symptom> reporting were explored. Interviews were audio-recorded , transcribed , and coded by two investigators to identify major themes. Fourteen RNs and seven providers ( MDs , PAs , and NPs) participated in the interviews. Three main themes emerged from the interviews: electronic symptom<symptom> reporting may improve assessment and care , integrating symptom<symptom> reporting into nurse workflow presents difficulties , and there are barriers for completion of surveys. The majority of nurses and providers believed that the inclusion of electronic symptom<symptom> reporting in bone<disease> marrow transplantation inpatient units has the potential to improve care but that barriers to implementation remain.
