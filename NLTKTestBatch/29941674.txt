 Von Willebrand factor ( VWF) is an adhesive ligand , and its activity is proteolytically regulated by the metalloprotease ADAMTS-13. An elevated level of plasma VWF has been widely considered a marker for endothelial cell activation in trauma and inflammation<symptom> , but its causal role in these pathological conditions remains poorly defined. Using a fluid percussion injury mouse model , we demonstrated that VWF released during acute traumatic brain injury ( TBI) was activated and became microvesicle-bound. The VWF-bound microvesicles promoted systemic vascular leakage and coagulation. Recombinant ADAMTS-13 given either before or after TBI reduced the VWF reactivity with minimal influence on VWF secretion. rADAMTS-13 protected the integrity of endothelial cell barriers and prevented TBI-induced coagulopathy by enhancing VWF cleavage , without impairing basal hemostasis. Promoting microvesicle clearance by lactadherin had efficacy similar to that of rADAMTS-13. This study uncovers a novel synergistic action between VWF and cellular microvesicles in TBI-induced vascular leakage and coagulopathy , and demonstrates protective effects of rADAMTS-13.
