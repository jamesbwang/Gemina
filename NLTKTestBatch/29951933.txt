 The study aimed to explore some novel diagnostic biomarkers for papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC) by identifying the different expression of TROP-2 , SLP-2 and CD56 in benign and malignant thyroid lesions<symptom>. We evaluated the mRNA expressions of TROP-2 and SLP-2 in fine needle aspirates ( FNAs) which contained 10 PTCs and 10 benign follicular adenomas ( FAs) using quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR). Immunohistochemical ( IHC) staining of TROP-2 , SLP-2 and CD56 was also performed on postoperative samples of 30 PTCs and 29 FAs. Membranous or cytoplasmic staining in > 10 % of cells was considered as positive. Diagnostic sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value ( NPV) and diagnostic accuracy of these three biomarkers were carried out. We further analyzed the associations between the clinical features and the expressions of markers in PTCs. The mRNA expressions of both TROP-2 and SLP-2 were increased substantially in PTCs in comparison with those in FAs ( P < 0.05). Similarly , IHC for these two proteins demonstrated higher positive staining in PTCs than in FAs ( 96.5 % vs. 12.5 % for TROP-2 , 83.3 % vs. 20.7 % for SLP-2 , P < 0.05). Conversely , CD56 expression was lost with 86.7 % of PTCs. In identifying malignancy , TROP-2 was the most sensitive marker and CD56 was the most specific one. When the markers were combined , the sensitivity and NPV increased to 100 % and had better diagnostic accuracy. However , no association was found between biomarker expressions and clinicopathological factors in PTCs. We found that TROP-2 , SLP-2 and CD56 were effective diagnostic markers for PTC , especially when they were combined to use.
