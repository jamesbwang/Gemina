 This study examined the remineralization potential of arginine ( Arg) in NaF toothpaste. Fifty enamel specimens allocated to five groups ( n = 10) were subjected to artificial caries<disease> formation. A 10-day pH-cycling was performed to treat specimens as per group- ( 1): 2 % Arg- NaF , ( 2): 4 % Arg- NaF , ( 3): 8 % Arg- NaF , ( 4): NaF and ( 5): deionized water. The test solutions were subjected to pH measurement , fluoride estimation , Na-Cl element analysis using ICP-EOS and FTIR analyses. Mineral density of the specimens were assessed using micro-CT; while Ca/P ratio and surface fluorine concentration were determined using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( EDS) and enamel fluoride uptake ( EFU) by acid-etch method. pH , fluoride concentration and Na-Cl ratio exhibited significant difference amongst groups ( p < 0.001). FTIR analysis showed presence of free amino acids in 2 % and 4 % Arg-NaF group. The mean mineral gain ( 0.40 Â± 0.07 g/cm Incorporation of 2 % arginine in NaF toothpaste significantly increased the remineralization of enamel caries-like lesion<symptom> when compared to NaF toothpaste; while 4 % and 8 % arginine in NaF toothpastes were ineffective in improving enamel remineralization. In high-risk patients , daily use of 2 % arginine in NaF toothpaste might provide a synergistic anti-caries effect given the proven prebiotic benefits of arginine in caries<disease> prevention and the demonstrated remineralization effect in the present study.
