 Pathogen burden accelerates atherosclerosis , but the mechanisms remain unresolved. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is linked to atherogenesis. Here we investigated whether Chlamydia<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom> ( C.pn) infection engages NLRP3 in promoting atherosclerosis. C.pn potentiated hyperlipidemia-induced inflammasome activity in cultured macrophages and in foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions<symptom> of Ldlr
