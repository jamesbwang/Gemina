 To investigate the effects of serum procalcitonin ( PCT) levels for predicting the outcome of bacteria<pathogen> bloodstream infection<disease> in acute leukemia<disease> patients. Clinical data from 236 patients with acute leukemia<disease> accompanied by bacterial bloodstream infection<disease> during July 2014 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed , 236 patients were divided into 5 groups ( < 0.05 ng/ml , 0.05- < 0.5 ng/ml , 0.5- < 2.0 ng/ml , 2.0- < 10.0 ng/ml and > 10.0 ng/ml) according to PCT concentrations. The median age of patients was 40 ( 13-73) years old. The male 123 cases ( 52.1 %) and female 113 cases ( 47.9 %) in 236 patients. The incidence of infection-related dealth in 5 groups was 0 % , 1.4 % , 13.8 % , 25.0 % and 33.3 % , respectively; the incidence of septic shock<symptom> and other serious complications in 5 groups was 0 % , 2.1 % , 13.8 % , 25.0 % , 33.3 % and 6.4 % , 7.0 % , 24.1 % , 41.7 % , 50.0 % , respectively , showing the concentration dependent manner and statistically significant difference ( u = 2127 , P = 0.000; u = 2234 , P = 0.000; u = 4102 , P = 0.000). Further analysis showed that with the increase of PCT concentration , the cumulative incidence of septic shock<symptom> , infection-related death and other serious complications was gradually increased with statistically significance ( HR = 2.887 , P = 0.000 , 95 % CI: 1.960-4.260; HR = 3.158 , P = 0.000 , 95 % CI: 2.100-4.740; HR = 2.158 , P = 0.000 , 95 % CI: 1.550-3.000) respectively. Increased procalcitonin level is an independent risk factor for septic shock<symptom> and infection-related death ( HR = 2.517 , P = 0.000 , 95 % CI: 1.520-4.168; HR = 2.881 , P = 0.000 , 95 % CI: 1.692-4.904) respectively. Serum procalcitonin level positively correlates with the incidence of serious bacteria<pathogen> bloodstream infection<disease> complications in the patients with acute leukemia<disease>. Increased procalcitonin level is an independent risk factor for septic shock<symptom> and infection-related death , indicating that procalcitonin may be an important prognostic factor for infection<disease> outcome in acute leukemia<disease> patients with bacteremia.
