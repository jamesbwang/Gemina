 Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy ( LADG) for gastric cancer has been widely applied; however , its oncologic efficacy has yet been well established. The study aimed to compare the long-term oncologic outcomes of LADG versus open distal gastrectomy ( ODG) on gastric cancer. The clinicopathologic data of gastric cancer patients who underwent distal gastrectomy with curative intent from October 2004 through September 2014 were included and analyzed in a retrospective cohort. The last follow-up was September 2016. 769 eligible patients ( LADG 414 vs. ODG 355) were included in the study. No significant difference was observed between the groups in 5-year DFS ( LADG 61.2 % vs. ODG 59.1 %; p = 0.384) and OS rates ( LADG 65.8 % vs. ODG 66.3 %; p = 0.750). During surgery , though LADG group had longer operating time , the blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was less than ODG group. LADG group had faster postoperative recovery course including shorter time to oral intake , ambulation , and discharge time. Postoperative complication rate within 30 days showed no significant difference between the groups ( LADG 15.7 % vs. ODG 13.0 %; p = 0.281). Age over 65 years old , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> > 200 ml , postoperative complication , and advanced T and N stage were identified as independent risk factors for DFS and OS. LADG could yield similar oncologic outcomes compared with ODG in treating distal gastric cancer. However , the findings need to be further confirmed through ongoing prospective randomized controlled trials.
