 To investigate the frequency of oral paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> from representative geographic regions of Brazil , and to compare data with a literature review. A retrospective study was conducted on 108,304 biopsies obtained from 1953 to 2016 at six Brazilian oral and maxillofacial pathology services. Demographic data and clinical and histopathological diagnosis of oral paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> were evaluated. A literature review of oral paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> studies published in three electronic databases was carried out. Data were analysed descriptively. A total of 320 cases of oral paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> were surveyed ( 0.3 % of the oral lesions<symptom> at the centres studied). The lesions<symptom> were more frequent among male patients. The gingiva/alveolar ridge was the most affected site. Mean age of affected individuals was 51.3 years ( Â± 11.7). The literature review showed a higher incidence of oral paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> in the South-East and South regions of Brazil. Male individuals and individuals between 50 and 59 years were most affected. Oral paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> is an uncommon lesion<symptom> observed in oral biopsy samples. The differences in the relative frequency of oral paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> are related to geographic variations. Men between 50 and 59 years are more affected. This study provides helpful information for clinicians in the diagnosis of oral paracoccidioidomycosis<disease>. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
