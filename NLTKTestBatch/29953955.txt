 The electrophysiological features and roles of persistent left superior vena cava ( PLSVC) in supraventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( SVT) are not known. To elucidate the electrophysiological features and roles of PLSVC in patients with SVT. We included 37 patients ( age: 43.5 ± 17.1 years; men: 35.1 %) with PLSVC and 510 patients ( age: 43.9 ± 18.8 years; men: 48.2 %) without PLSVC who underwent an electrophysiological study for SVT. The number of induced tachycardias<symptom> , location of the slow pathway ( SP) or accessory pathway ( AP) , and radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA) outcomes were compared between patients with and without PLSVC. During RFCA of the left AP , a coronary sinus ( CS) catheter was placed into the left superior vena cava ( LSVC group) or the great cardiac vein ( GCV group). The RFCA outcomes were compared between the groups. In the patients with PLSVC , 40 tachycardias<symptom> were induced: atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia<symptom> ( AVNRT) ( n = 19) , atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia<symptom> ( n = 17) , and focal atrial tachycardia<symptom> ( n = 4). Among patients with AVNRT , an SP in the CS was significantly more frequent in patients with PLSVC than in those without PLSVC ( 47.4 % versus 3.8 % , P < .001). In patients with the left AP , the number of RFCA attempts and recurrence were lower in the GCV group than in the LSVC group. An SP in the CS is prevalent in patients with AVNRT and PLSVC. It is useful to place a CS catheter into the great cardiac vein in patients with a left AP and PLSVC.
