 The method of liquid nitrogen quick-freezing combined with dilute acid rapid-thawing was applied as a pretreatment to extract gelatins from pigskins , and the influence of HCl concentration ( 0-2 % ( v/v)) on the gelatinization of collagen in pigskins was observed. The freezing-thawing using liquid nitrogen and water did not effectively induce the gelatinization of collagen , and the replacement of water with dilute HCl solutions improved this situation. The gelatin pretreated with liquid nitrogen and 1 % HCl showed the highest yield and strongest gel properties , since the hydrogen bonds balance<symptom> and the triple-helical structure in collagen were damaged moderately after this pretreatment to promote the release of subunit components in collagen during gelatin extraction. The surface of the gelatinized collagen via freezing-thawing pretreatment with liquid nitrogen and 1 % HCl showed a similar honeycomb shape as traditional acid pretreatment. However , the pretreatment time could be shortened from 6 h ( traditional acid method) to 20 min. Therefore , the freezing-thawing method combined with liquid nitrogen and dilute acid could be potentially used in gelatin preparation.
