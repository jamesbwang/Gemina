 To evaluate how age-related trends in nutritional status , physical health , and parental well-being in females with Rett syndrome<symptom> may be related to gastrostomy placement and to examine the impact of the procedure on mortality. We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome<symptom> Study and analyzed their demographic , genetic , and child and parental health data collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures of outcomes and age , gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals with gastrostomy. Nearly one-third ( 30.3 %) of the cases underwent gastrostomy placement. Nutritional status based on weight , height , and body mass index ( BMI) improved over time , and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement than in those without ( adjusted Î² = 0.87 , 95 % CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association between gastrostomy placement and individual 's physical health outcomes or parental physical and mental health , nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy insertion status. Nevertheless , among those at risk of suboptimal weight , the all-cause mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with those who had not ( hazard ratio 4.07 , 95 % CI 1.96-8.45). Gastrostomy placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome<symptom> , but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear.
