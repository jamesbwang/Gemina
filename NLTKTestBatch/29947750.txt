 Pulmonary hypertension ( PH) and pulmonary vascular disease<disease> ( PVD) are common and associated with adverse outcomes in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF). Little is known about the impact of PVD on the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction patients ( n = 161) with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( â‰¥ 15 mmHg) at rest were classified into three groups: non-PH-HFpEF ( n = 21); PH but no PVD ( isolated post-capillary PH , IpcPH; n = 95); and PH with PVD ( combined post- and pre-capillary PH , CpcPH; n = 45). At rest , CpcPH-HFpEF patients had more right ventricular ( RV) dysfunction and lower pulmonary arterial ( PA) compliance compared to all other groups. While right atrial pressure ( RAP) and left ventricular transmural pressure ( LVTMP) were similar in HFpEF with and without PH or PVD at rest , CpcPH-HFpEF patients demonstrated greater increase in RAP , enhanced ventricular interdependence , and paradoxical reduction in LVTMP during exercise , differing from all other groups ( P < 0.05). Lower PA compliance was correlated with greater increase in RAP with exercise. During exercise , CpcPH-HFpEF patients displayed an inability to enhance cardiac output , reduction in forward stroke volume , and blunted augmentation in RV systolic performance , changes that were coupled with marked limitation in aerobic capacity. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction patients with PVD demonstrate unique haemodynamic limitations during exercise that constrain aerobic capacity , including impaired recruitment of LV preload due to excessive right heart congestion<symptom> and blunted RV systolic reserve. Interventions targeted to this distinct pathophysiology require testing in patients with HFpEF and PVD.
