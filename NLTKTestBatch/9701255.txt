 Graft-versus-host disease<disease> ( GVHD) is among the most frequent complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT). GVHD has several clinical manifestations in the oral cavity , including painful desquamative erythema , ulcerative mucosal lesions<symptom> , and lichenoid lesions<symptom>. The patients presenting with oral GVHD complain of oral sensitivity , pain , dysgeusia , and xerostomia. The treatment of oral GVHD includes a proper systemic therapy combined with a good oral hygiene and the use of local and topical steroids. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are used for the treatment of chronic oral GVHD; however , they are associated with different complications. Evidence shows that curcumin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The treatment of lichen planus and oral mucositis with curcumin has been successful. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of topical curcumin in Orabase and triamcinolone in Orabase in the patients affected by oral GVHD. Twenty-six patients presenting with oral GVHD were randomly divided into two groups of 13 using block randomization. The control group used triamcinolone in Orabase , and the case group received curcumin in Orabase. The two groups were not significantly different in terms of the alleviated severity of the lesions<symptom> at the end of the treatment ( P = 0.052). The comparison of the pain score via the visual analog scale ( VAS) at the onset of the treatment and at days 14 and 28 ( completion of the treatment) showed no significant difference between the two groups ( P > 0.05). Curcumin has comparable efficacy to that of triamcinolone and may be prescribed for the patients presenting with oral GVHD.
