 Purpose The Work Rehabilitation Questionnaire ( WORQ) is a patient-reported instrument to assess work related functioning in vocational rehabilitation ( VR) and work , based on the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health ( ICF) core set for VR. The objective of this study was to cross-culturally adapt WORQ to French and to evaluate its psychometric properties. Methods The cross-cultural adaptation followed a dual-panel approach. Psychometrics was examined in one VR-centre in the French speaking part of Switzerland. Test-retest reliability was analyzed with intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) , internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach 's alpha. Construct validity was determined by convergence to the self-reported general functioning scale and the Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scales ( HADS). The association of patient 's return-to-work expectation within 6-months and having a case manager was examined. The usability of WORQ-French was tested in 10 VR patients. Results Eighty-nine patients with musculoskeletal injuries were included. WORQ-French showed excellent internal consistency ( 0.968) and a high test-retest reliability ( 0.935). WORQ-French was positively associated with self-reported general functioning ( r = 0.662) and both HADS scales ( r = 0.56-0.57). Neither the patient 's return-to-work expectation nor having a case manager were significantly correlated with WORQ-French. Usability in terms of understandability of questions and response<symptom> options was found to be good. Seven patients rated the length of WORQ-French as good , while two found the instrument a little too long and one found it too long. Conclusions WORQ French is a valid , reliable , and easy to administer instrument to assess self-reported work functioning given our study setting and sample characteristics.
