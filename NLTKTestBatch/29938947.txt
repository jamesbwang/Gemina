 5-20 wt % trimethoxysilylpropyl octadecyldimethyl ammonium chloride ( QAS) was used to modify Poly ( Îµ-caprolactone) ( PCL)- gelatin hybrid to fabricate non-leaching antibacterial nanofiber membranes<symptom> ( PG-Q) by electrospinning. The results from scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) indicated that the QAS leaded to phase separation between the QAS and PCL. Hydrophilic test demonstrated that the PG-Q nanofiber membranes<symptom> had hydrophobic surface , which was help for peeling off the dressing from the wound<disease>. Additionally , the physical and chemical cross-linking between the QAS/PCL and QAS/gelatin were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR) , which were good for long lasting antibacterial effect. The PG-Q membranes<symptom> also showed excellent cell-biocompatibility. Furthermore , compared with pure PCL nanofiber membrane , the PG-Q nanofiber membranes<symptom> , especially PG-Q15 ( QAS: 15 wt %) and PG-Q20 ( QAS: 20 wt %) , showed a considerable increase in the bacteriostatic rate of
