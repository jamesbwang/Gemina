 The effects of climate change constitute a major concern in Arctic waters due to the rapid decline of sea ice , which may strongly alter the movements and habitat availability of Arctic marine mammals. We tracked 98 bowhead whales by satellite over an 11-year period ( 2001-2011) in Baffin Bay - West Greenland to investigate the environmental drivers ( specifically sea surface temperature and sea ice) involved in bowhead whale 's movements. Movement<symptom> patterns differed according to season , with aggregations of whales found at higher latitudes during spring and summer likely in response to sea-ice retreat and increasing sea temperature ( SST) facilitated by the warm West Greenland Current. In contrast , the whales moved further south in response to sea temperature decrease during autumn and winter. Statistical models indicated that the whales targeted a narrow range of SSTs from -0.5 to 2 Â°C. Sea surface temperatures are predicted to undergo a marked increase in the Arctic , which could expose bowhead whales to both thermal stress and altered stratification and vertical transport of water masses. With such profound changes , bowhead whales may face extensive habitat loss. Our results highlight the need for closer investigation and monitoring in order to predict the extent of future distribution changes.
