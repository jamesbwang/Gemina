 Currently approved inhibitors of the PD-1/ PD-L1 pathway represent a major advance for the treatment of lung cancers , yet they are ineffective in a majority of patients due to lack of pre-existing T cell reactivity. Here we show that a TLR9 agonist delivered by inhalation is able to prime T cell responses against poorly immunogenic lung tumors and to complement the effects of PD-1 blockade. Inhaled TLR9 agonist causes profound remodeling in tumor-bearing lungs , leading to formation of tertiary lymphoid structures adjacent to the tumors , CD8 + T cell infiltration into the tumors , dendritic cell expansion and antibody production. Inhalation of TLR9 agonist also increased the pool of functional PD-1lowT-bethigh effector CD8 + T in tumor-bearing lungs. Effector CD8 + T cells generated by inhaled TLR9 agonist treatment were licensed by PD-1 blockade to become highly functional CTL , leading to a durable rejection of both lung tumors and tumor lesions<symptom> outside the lungs. CD4 + T cells activated in response to inhaled TLR9 play a critical role in this process by controlling the proliferation , preventing exhaustion<symptom> , and guiding the differentiation of optimally functional CTL. This study characterizes a strategy to apply localized TLR9 stimulation to a tumor type not accessible for direct injection , a strategy that may expand the therapeutic potential of PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer.
