 The aim of this study was to measure changes in epithelial thickness in the lingual mucosa<pathogen> of golden hamsters submitted to the topical application of distilled alcoholic beverages. Forty golden hamsters were randomly divided into: Group 1-cachaça 48 ° GL and Group 2-whisky 40 ° GL. Alcohol was applied to the right side of the tongue , the left side served as control. Seventy microscopic fields were evaluated. The data were submitted to descriptive statistics , the Wilcoxon test and the Mann-Whitney U test ( p < 0.05). In Group 1 , there was a significant difference in mean total epithelial thickness between the test side and control side ( p = 0.044) , with significant reductions in the thickness of the epithelial and corneal layers ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.021 , respectively). At 13 weeks , statistically significant reductions were found in the thickness of both the corneal and epithelial layers ( p = 0.032 and p < 001 , respectively). At 20 weeks , a statistically significant reduction was found in only the epithelial layer ( p = 0.002). In the whisky group , significant increases were found in the thickness of the corneal and epithelial layers ( p = 0.015 and p = 0.012 , respectively) at 13 weeks. Cachaça 48 ° GL promoted epithelial atrophy , whereas whisky 40 ° GL promoted epithelial<disease> hyperplasia<disease>. Based on the present findings , different types of distilled alcoholic beverages cause different morphometric and morphological changes in the lingual mucosa<pathogen>. Cachaça caused epithelial atrophy , which may facilitate the penetration of carcinogenic agents , whereas whisky caused epithelial<disease> hyperplasia<disease> , especially in the basal layer , which suggests the onset of the development of premalignant lesions<symptom>.
