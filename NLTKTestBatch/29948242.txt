 Brain imaging is one of the most important diagnostic methods for evaluating headache<symptom> during pregnancy. In this study , we aimed to identify anamnestic and clinical predictors for pathological brain imaging findings in pregnant women suffering from acute<symptom> headache<symptom>. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 151 pregnant women with acute<symptom> headache<symptom> between 2010 and 2016. We screened the medical records of these patients and analyzed radiological variables , including brain imaging frequency and modality , delay to imaging and imaging findings. In patients with brain imaging , we compared several anamnestic and clinical features between those with and without symptomatic pathological findings. Half of the patients ( 50.3 %) underwent brain imaging , mainly magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) including venography ( 53.9 %) or MRI including both venography and arteriography ( 31.6 %). Symptomatic pathological results could be observed in 27.6 % of the patients with a brain scan. Patients in the first trimester with acute<symptom> headache<symptom> had a statistically higher risk for a symptomatic pathological imaging finding ( p = 0.024). Strong pain intensity , a reduced level of consciousness<symptom> and seizures<symptom> were significantly associated with a symptomatic pathological imaging outcome across all stages of pregnancy. Brain imaging may reveal a secondary headache<symptom> etiology in more than 25 % of pregnant women presenting with acute<symptom> headache<symptom>. In particular , when the acute<symptom> headache<symptom> is of severe intensity , and the headache<symptom> is accompanied by seizures<symptom> or a change in consciousness<symptom> , brain imaging is required.
