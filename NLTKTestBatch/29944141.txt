 This study analyzed whether the loss of repetition velocity during a resistance exercise set was a reliable indicator of the number of repetitions left in reserve. Following the assessment of one-repetition ( 1RM) strength and full load-velocity relationship , thirty men were divided into three groups according to their 1RM strength/body mass: novice , well-trained and highly-trained. On two separate occasions and in random order , subjects performed tests of maximal number of repetitions to failure<symptom> against loads of 65 % , 75 % and 85 % 1RM in four exercises: bench press , full squat , prone bench pull and shoulder press. For each exercise , and regardless of the load being used , the absolute velocities associated to stopping a set before failure , leaving a certain number of repetitions ( 2 , 4 , 6 or 8) in reserve , were very similar and showed a high reliability ( CV 4.4-8.0 %). No significant differences in these stopping velocities were observed for any resistance training exercise analyzed between the novice , well-trained and highly-trained groups. These results indicate that by monitoring repetition velocity one can estimate with high accuracy the proximity of muscle<symptom> failure<symptom> and , therefore , to more objectively quantify the level of effort and fatigue<symptom> being incurred during resistance training. This method emerges as a substantial improvement over the use of perceived exertion to gauge the number of repetitions left in reserve.
