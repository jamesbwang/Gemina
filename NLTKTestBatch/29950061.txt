 `` Only one syndrome<symptom> is evident for disease<disease> '' , a clinical guiding ideology in the Treatise on Febrile Diseases<disease> proposed by Zhang Zhongjing , has caused widespread controversy among physicians over the ages. The core lies in the divergence of the understanding of `` one syndrome<symptom> ''. The reason is that although many physicians sum up experience on the basis of their clinical experience , the premise of the clinical environment is ignored when interpreting the connotation. On the one hand , `` only one syndrome<symptom> is evident for disease<disease> '' emphasizes the flexibility of grasping the main symptoms<symptom> clinically. On the other hand , it emphasizes the evidence sufficiency of `` one syndrome<symptom> '' as the basis for diagnosis. Generally speaking , specific symptoms<symptom> are higher evidence as a basis for diagnosis. However , because of the clinical complexity , the symptoms<symptom> with lower specificity , less targeting and lower evidence strength in common cases may become the key points of the final prescription selection in specific cases sometimes , increasing the strength of evidence and becoming the only important factor in determining the overall situation. In addition to the objective clinical conditions , some subjective factors such as clinical level and academic quality of the physicians are also important factors that affect the clinical application of `` only one syndrome<symptom> is evident for disease<disease> ''. Therefore , it is necessary to not only pay attention to the clinical objective conditions , but also try to improve the physicians ' clinical level , appreciate the `` only one syndrome<symptom> is evident for disease<disease> '' thought in the clinical environment , which is the key to solve this problem.
