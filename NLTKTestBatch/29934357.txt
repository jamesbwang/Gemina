 Growth hormone-releasing hormone ( GHRH) plays an important role in brain functions. The aim of this study was to examine cognitive functions and emotional behaviour in a mouse model of isolated GH deficiency due to bi-allelic ablation of the GHRH gene ( GHRH knockout , GHRHKO). Learning , memory and emotional behaviour were evaluated using a series of validated tests ( Morris water maze , eight-arm radial maze , open field , elevated plus maze test , forced swim tests) in 2 , 5 , and 12 months old male mice either homozygous (-/-) or heterozygous ( +/-) for the GHRHKO allele. Compared with age-matched +/- mice ,-/- mice showed decreased cognitive performance in Morris water and eight-arm radial maze tests. By comparing the effects of aging in each genotype , we observed an age-related impairment in +/- mice , while in-/- mice a significant decline in cognitive function was found only in 12 months compared with 2 months old mice , but no difference was found between 5 months old vs. 2 months old.-/- mice showed increased exploration activity compared to age-matched +/- controls , while both strains of mice had an age-related decrease in exploration activity. When evaluated through open field , elevated plus maze and forced swim tests ,-/- mice demonstrated a decrease in anxiety<symptom> and depression-related behaviour compared to age-matched +/- controls. Homozygous ablation of GHRH gene is associated with decreased performance in learning and memory tests , possibly linked to increased spontaneous locomotor activity. Additionally , we observed an age-related decline in cognitive functions in both genotypes.
