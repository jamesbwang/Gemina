 To correlate interpedicular distance ( IPD) with radiographic parameters , neurological deficit and posterior structures injury in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. One hundred three thoracolumbar burst fracture patients were retrospectively reviewed. IPD was measured from the medial sclerotic areas of the pedicles on anteroposterior plain radiographs. Data concerning local kyphosis ( LK) , the ratio of anterior to posterior vertebral height ( A/P ratio) , loss of vertebral body height ( LOVBH) and spinal canal stenosis ( SCS) , neurological status<symptom> and posterior structures ( lamina , posterior ligamentous complex and facet joint) injury were correlated to IPD using correlation analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the threshold of IPD that is predictive of neurological deficit and posterior structures injury. A total of 95.15 % ( 98/103) of patients presented with increased IPD , ranging from 1.41 % to 41.53 % , with a mean of 10.92 Â± 3.37 %. Regarding radiographic parameters , both LK and SCS were linearly correlated with IPD. There was a significant correlation between IPD and neurological status<symptom>; logistic regression analysis showed that an IPD increase of greater than 20 % was an indicator for neurological deficit. In addition , both facet joint injury and lamina fracture were associated with IPD , with IPD increase exceeding 15 % being an indicator for facet joint injury and that exceeding 20 % being a predictor of lamina fracture. The results indicate that IPD correlates to LK , SCS , neurological status<symptom> , facet joint injury and lamina fracture. Our data demonstrate that IPD measured from plain radiograph is a reliable indicator for assessment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
