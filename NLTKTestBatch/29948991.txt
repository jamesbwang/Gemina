 There is insufficient data from India regarding clinical predictors of dyssynergic defecation. To identify demography , symptom<symptom> , and colonoscopic parameters that can predict dyssynergic defecation ( DD) among patients with chronic constipation<symptom> ( CC) and to compare the profile among male and female patients with DD. Data collected from three centers during June 2014 to May 2017 included age , gender , symptom<symptom> duration , form and consistency of stools<symptom> , digital examination , colonoscopy , and anorectal manometry ( ARM). Patients were grouped based on ARM diagnosis: group I ( normal study) and group II ( DD). The two groups were compared for demography , symptom<symptom> profile , and colonoscopy findings. Gender-wise subset analysis was done for those with the normal and abnormal ARM using chi-square and unpaired t tests. Of 236 patients with CC evaluated , 130 ( 55 %) had normal ARM and 106 ( 45 %) had DD. Male sex , straining during defecation , bleeding per rectum , and abnormal colonoscopic diagnosis were significantly more common in group II. While bleeding per rectum and absence of urge to defecate were more common in males ( p < 0.02) , straining , digital evacuation , and hard stools<symptom> were commoner in females with DD. Straining during defecation , bleeding per rectum , and abnormal colonoscopy findings were more common in patients with DD. Symptoms<symptom> of bleeding per rectum and absence of urge to defecate in men and straining during defecation in female patients were significantly associated with DD. Symptoms<symptom> differ in males and females with DD.
