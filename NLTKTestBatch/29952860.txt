 Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) modulates spontaneous neuronal activity that can generate long-term neuroplastic changes. It has been used in numerous therapeutic trials showing significant clinical effects especially when combined with other behavioral therapies. One area of intensive tDCS research is chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Since the initial tDCS trials for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> treatment using current parameters of stimulation , more than 60 clinical trials have been published testing its effects in different pain syndromes<symptom>. However , as the field moves in the direction of clinical application , several aspects need to be taken into consideration regarding tDCS effectiveness and parameters of stimulation. In this article , we reviewed the evidence of tDCS effects for the treatment of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and critically analyzed the literature pertaining its safety and efficacy , and how to optimize tDCS clinical effects in a therapeutic setting. We discuss optimization of tDCS effects in 3 different domains: ( i) parameters of stimulation , ( ii) combination therapies , and ( iii) subject selection. This article aims to provide insights for the development of future tDCS clinical trials.
