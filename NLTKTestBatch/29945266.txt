 Susceptibility to Candida spp. infection<disease> is largely determined by the status<symptom> of host immunity , whether immunocompromised/immunodeficient or immunocompetent. Interleukin-2 ( IL-2) , a potent lymphoid cell growth factor , is a four-Î±-helix bundle cytokine induced by activated T cells with two important roles: the activation and maintenance of immune responses , and lymphocyte<symptom> production and differentiation. We reviewed the roles of cytokines as immune stimulators and suppressors of Candida spp. infections<disease> as an update on this continuously evolving field. We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , Medline ( PubMed) , and Embase databases for articles published from March 2010 to March 2016 using the following search terms: interleukins , interleukin-2 , Candida spp. , and immunosuppression. Data from our own studies were also reviewed. Here , we provide an overview focusing on the ability of IL-2 to induce a large panel of trafficking receptors in skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and control T helper ( Th) 2 cytokine production in response to contact with Candida spp.. Immunocompromised patients have reduced capacity to secrete Th1-related cytokines such as IL-2. The ability to secrete the Th1-related cytokine IL-2 is low in immunocompromised patients. This prevents an efficient Th1 immune response to Candida spp. antigens , making immunocompromised patients more susceptible to candidal infections<disease>.
