 Although inaccurate , non-reproducible blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> values can result from non-standardized assessments , recommended approaches to standardize blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measurement are often not followed in research studies. An expert consensus of national and international health and scientific organizations developed recommended minimum standards for assessing blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in research subjects where: 1) blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> or hypertension is a major endpoint , or 2) blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> is likely a major mediator of the research outcome. Minimum research standards are presented for training of observers , technical aspects of assessing blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and equipment for both adults and children. The standards are based on prior recommendations some of which did not conform to the current evidence based methods. All new research should require adherence to these minimum standards on the patient populations described above. Readers need to use caution in interpreting studies if the standards are not met in the defined populations.
