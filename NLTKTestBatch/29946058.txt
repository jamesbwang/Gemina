 BACKGROUND Pediatric condition falsification ( PCF) is a rare form of child abuse in which a caregiver fabricates or induces illness in the child. The diagnosis is difficult and controversial and can easily include false positives. CASE REPORT A boy , 3.18 kg birthweight ( P25 curve) , lost weight<symptom> between age 56 to120 days. Cow milk allergy was suspected , feeding was changed to elementary formula , and he started catch-up weight<symptom> growth while remaining significantly underweight. His pediatrician continuously interpreted his low<symptom> weight<symptom> as insufficient growth , despite prescribing 3 times the normal caloric intake , concluded that the mother purposely malnourished her son , diagnosed PCF , and the boy was separated from his family ( days 502-755 of age). PCF was confirmed by 2 other pediatricians and 3 child protection physicians and was supported by 4 child protection agencies and 6 judges. However , proper analysis of the weight<symptom> growth ( kg/year) from the weight<symptom> curve showed a normal weight<symptom> gain. Beyond 120 days of age , weight<symptom> gain at home was significantly above normal ( during 347-489 days: 6.2 versus 3 kg/year of the P50). He reached P25 again at around 516 days. CONCLUSIONS The question `` How could so many physicians misjudge weight<symptom> gain? '' has scientific and sociologic aspects. Scientifically , low<symptom> weight<symptom> was wrongly interpreted as insufficient weight<symptom> growth , requiring that physicians learn how to assess weight<symptom> gain from weight<symptom> curves. Sociologically , physicians seem to follow a diagnosis made by a colleague without proper evaluation. Arguments provided by the parents against this diagnosis seemed to be neglected. Confirmation bias occurs when any information against PCF is disregarded.
