 In patients with psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( PsA) , limited data exist regarding patterns of biologic therapy use. To examine treatment patterns and therapy modifications in U.S. patients with PsA receiving a tumor necrosis<symptom> factor inhibitor ( TNFi) or an anti-interleukin ( IL) -12/ 23 inhibitor. Adults with PsA who newly initiated a biologic therapy ( index biologic) between January 1 , 2013 , and January 31 , 2015 , were included from the Optum Research Database. Biologic therapies comprised those that were approved by the FDA for the treatment of PsA at the time of the study initiation ( adalimumab , certolizumab pegol , etanercept , golimumab , infliximab , or ustekinumab). Outcomes included adherence , persistence , and discontinuation of the index biologic; initiation of adjunctive medications ( nonbiologics , including those commonly used for pain and/or inflammation); and dose escalation of the index biologic during the 12-month follow-up period. Of the 1,235 patients included , 52.5 % were female , and mean ( SD) age was 50.3 ( 12.1) years. The mean ( SD) duration of persistence with a newly initiated index biologic ( etanercept ( 48.1 %) , adalimumab ( 24.0 %) , infliximab ( 10.4 %) , golimumab ( 8.3 %) , ustekinumab ( 7.2 %) , or certolizumab pegol ( 2.0 %)) was 246 ( 128) days; 44.5 % of patients persisted with the index biologic for ≥ 12 months. During the 12-month follow-up period , 22.9 % of patients switched to a different biologic , 26.8 % discontinued without switching or restarting , and 5.8 % discontinued and restarted the index biologic. Of the 1,010 patients who persisted with the index biologic for > 90 days , 45.6 % received ≥ 1 adjunctive medication during the period from 90 days after the index date to the end of persistence or 12 months. The most commonly initiated adjunctive medications were corticosteroids ( 22.0 %) , opioids ( 17.1 %) , and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( 12.9 %). Overall , 9.6 % of patients had a dose escalation of the index biologic in the immediate 12-month post-index period. This real-world study of treatment patterns for PsA , which used a large U.S. claims database , demonstrated that the majority of patients with PsA discontinued their index biologic ( TNFi or anti-IL-12/ 23 inhibitor) before 12 months. Nearly half of patients initiated an adjunctive medication , many of which were pain and conventional anti-inflammatory medications. This study was sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.
