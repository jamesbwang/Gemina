 To determine the prognostic role of high PD-L1 in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. Electronic databases , such as PubMed , Embase and Cochrane library , were searched to identify studies evaluating PD-L1 expression and overall survival ( OS) in these patients. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. A total of 12 studies that involved 1595 patients were included. Pooled hazard ratio ( HR) 1.02 ( 95 % CI = 0.93-1.11 , P = 0.71) indicated that the association between PD-L1 expression and overall survival ( OS) was not significant. The pooled odds ratios ( ORs) indicated that PD-L1 expression was associated with gender ( OR = 0.64 , 95 % CI = 0.48-0.85 , P = 0.002) , differentiation ( OR = 0.58 , 95 % CI = 0.37-0.90 , P = 0.01) and HPV infection<disease> ( OR = 1.91 , 95 % CI = 1.13-3.23 , P = 0.02). However , PD-L1 had no correlation with tumour size , and lymph node status<symptom>. PD-L1 expression may not be an independent predictor of prognosis of patients with OSCC. Well-designed large cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings.
