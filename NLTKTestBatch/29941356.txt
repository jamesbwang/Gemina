 Many pediatric surgeons have limited experience of esophageal replacement. This study reports outcomes of esophageal replacement by gastric transposition performed by a single UK-based pediatric surgeon. Consecutive patients were identified who underwent esophageal replacement by gastric transposition over a 28 year period. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Weight-for-age Z-scores were calculated for esophageal atresia patients. Nineteen patients were identified. Indication in the majority was long-gap esophageal atresia ( n = 17; 10 with tracheoesophageal fistula<disease>). At surgery , median age was 8.5 months ( range 2-55); median weight<symptom> was 7.4 kg ( range 4.0-17.4 kg). A right-sided thoracotomy or transhiatal approach was used. Median postoperative length of stay was 17.5 days ( range 7-130); median intensive care stay was three days ( range 1-63). There were no deaths. Anastomotic leak rate at 30 days was 10.5 % ( n = 2). One patient required early stricture dilatation. Median weight-for-age Z-score increased from -2.17 at one year of age to -1.86 , -1.70 and -1.93 at 5 , 10 and 15 years. Esophageal replacement by gastric transposition offers a potentially life-changing treatment; however , it is associated with significant morbidity. The majority of patients eventually achieve full oral feeding and maintenance of weight<symptom> gain trajectory. A right-sided approach to the esophagus is feasible. Treatment Study. IV.
