 Thromboelastography with platelet mapping ( TEG-PM) is a modality to measure platelet function , especially in patients taking antiplatelet medications. It consists of two components: arachidonic acid ( AA) , which is sensitive to aspirin , and adenosine diphosphate ( ADP) , which is sensitive to clopidogrel. In patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages<symptom> ( sICH) , the clinical interpretation of platelet mapping is unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate TEG-PM in patients with sICH on aspirin and/or clopidogrel who receive platelet transfusions. This study was an IRB-approved , retrospective case-control study over three years at an academic medical center. Adult patients with sICH were included if they had an admission computed tomography head<disease> ( CTH) and platelet mapping followed by a repeat platelet mapping and CTH post platelet transfusion. A threshold of 50 % inhibition was used as the benchmark for both ADP and AA inhibition. Around 248 subjects with sICH were identified , and 107 were excluded for incomplete documentation , leaving 141 for analysis. Of these , nine met our inclusion criteria. No statistical significance was found on the antithrombotic effects of aspirin or clopidogrel on TEG-PM ( p = 1.00 for both). Sensitivity and specificity of TEG-PM for clopidogrel was 100 % and 42.9 % , respectively , and 80 % and 0 % , respectively , for aspirin. Platelet transfusion did not significantly change AA or ADP inhibition ( p = 1.00). Hemorrhagic expansion on CTH was not associated with a decrease AA or ADP inhibition ( p = 1.00). TEG-PM is not an effective measure of platelet inhibition in sICH patients who were on antiplatelet medications and is not a reliable measurement following platelet transfusion.
