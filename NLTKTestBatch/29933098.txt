 Nonspecific lower back pain ( LBP) has been a major public health problem in western countries since the second half of the 20 t h century. The trend has expanded to non-western countries , and LBP is currently a significant cause of disability in the working population. To investigate the prevalence of nonspecific lower back pain ( LBP) and its risk factors among soldiers in the Chinese army. A total of 2876 Chinese army soldiers were requested to complete a self-administered questionnaire on demographic , anthropometric factors , and their non-specific LBP symptoms<symptom>. The LBP evaluation and risk factor analysis were based on the self-questionnaire survey. The prevalence of non-specific LBP with physical state , one-child family , educational status , resident location and ethnicity were not associated ( P > 0.05); while smoking , LBP history , LBP family history , nightmare frequency , sleep quality , and self-perceived fitness had significant effects on LBP ( P < 0.05 , Table 2). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that smoking ( OR = 2.153,95 % CI = 1.045-4.433) , History of LBP ( OR = 2.503,95 % CI = 1.580-3.966) , LBP family history ( OR = 1.615,95 % CI = 1.015-2.572) , nightmare frequency ( OR = 3.386 , 95 % CI = 2.047-5.603) , sleep quality ( OR = 2.391 , 95 % CI = 1.085-5.269) and self-perceived fitness ( OR = 1.93,95 % CI = 1.045-3.765) had significant effects on LBP ( P < 0.05)) ( Table 3). Smoking , history of LBP , LBP family history , nightmare frequency , sleep quality , self-perceived fitness were important factors in the occurrence and persistence of LBP.
