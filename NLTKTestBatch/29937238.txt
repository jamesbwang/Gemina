 We compare the effectiveness of 2 nontargeted HIV<pathogen> and hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> screening protocols integrated consecutively into care in an urban emergency department: a nurse-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm followed by an automated-laboratory-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm programmed into the electronic health record. This was a before-after comparative effectiveness cohort study. All patients aged 18 to 75 years who received treatment during 5-month periods were eligible for participation. The main outcome measures were the number of patients screened and the number with newly diagnosed HIV<pathogen> and hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> infection. Of the eligible patients , 6,736 ( 33.9 %) completed HIV<pathogen> screening during the automated-laboratory-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm , whereas 4,121 ( 19.6 %) completed HIV<pathogen> screening during the nurse-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm ( difference 14.3 %; 95 % confidence interval 13.4 % to 15.1 %); and 6,972 ( 35.1 %) completed hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> screening during the automated-laboratory-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm , whereas 2,968 ( 14.2 %) completed hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> screening during the nurse-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm ( difference 20.9 %; 95 % confidence interval 20.1 % to 21.7 %). More patients had newly diagnosed HIV<pathogen> ( 23 versus 17) and hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> infection ( 101 versus 29) during the automated-laboratory-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm than the nurse-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm. Results were more often available before discharge ( HIV<pathogen> 87.2 % versus 65.1 %; hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> 90.0 % versus 65.4 %) and fewer patients underwent repeated screening ( HIV<pathogen> 1.6 % versus 5.8 %; hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> 1.3 % versus 4.5 %) during the automated-laboratory-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm than the nurse-order HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening algorithm. An electronic health record algorithm that automatically links HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> screening to laboratory ordering for adult patients is more effective than a nurse-driven protocol. With widespread use of electronic health record systems , this model can be easily replicated and should be considered the standard for future programs.
