 Age-related events , such as cardiopulmonary complications , delirium<symptom> , transfer to rehabilitation facility , and dependency are a major problem after hepatic resection in elderly. This prospective multicenter study aimed to preoperatively evaluate frailty in the elderly according to a phenotypic frail index , named the `` Kihon Checklist ( KCL) , '' to predict `` age-related events '' after hepatic resection. Between May 2016 and September 2017 , 217 independently living patients who consented among all patients aged ≥ 65 years who planned to undergo hepatic resection were included in the study. Preoperative frailty was defined as a total KCL score ≥ 8. We analyzed clinical characteristics and outcomes , including age-related events ( major respiratory and cardiac complications , delirium<symptom> medication needed , transfer to rehabilitation facility , and dependency) between patients with and without frailty. Of the 217 patients , 63 and 154 were classified into the frail and non-frail groups , respectively. The incidences of age-related events ( 31.7 % vs. 7.8 % , P < 0.001) were higher in the frail group. Multivariate analysis indicated that frailty ( P < 0.001 , hazard ratio 5.16) and resection of ≥ 2 sectors ( P = 0.014 , hazard ratio 2.98) were independent risk factors for age-related events. Frailty evaluated by KCL in the elderly can predict postoperative age-related events after hepatic resection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
