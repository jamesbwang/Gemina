 Predicting episodes or severity of cardiorespiratory decompensation has proved to be challenging in patients with stable surgical or medical conditions , recovering on the general care floor ( ward). Critical cardiorespiratory events on hospital floors may be prevented by early detection of deterioration using continuous , electronic cardiorespiratory monitoring ( CEM). The PRediction of Opioid-induced Respiratory<symptom> Depression<symptom> In Patients Monitored by capnoGraphY ( PRODIGY) trial investigates CEM using pulse oximetry and capnography in 1650 patients at 16 centers in North<pathogen> America , Europe , and Asia ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02811302). The primary goal of the study is to derive a risk prediction score for respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> ( RD) on the ward. The validation-derivation cohort design will derive this score from RD detected by continuous , blinded , multiparameter cardiorespiratory ( heart rate , respiratory rate , end tidal carbon dioxide , and pulse oximetry) monitoring of patients on the ward receiving parenteral ( including epidural) opioids for primary analgesia. This review provides a comprehensive synopsis on respiratory compromise in lower acuity hospital settings ( ward) and describes the protocol of the PRODIGY trial as a means to enable prediction and early response to these events.
