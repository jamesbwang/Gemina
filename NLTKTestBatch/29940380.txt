 Intraoperative neuromonitoring ( ION) signal changes during spine surgery may portend a potentially catastrophic neurologic injury which , if identified and addressed expediently , may allow the surgeon to take correction actively and prevent permanent neurologic injury. We report a case of transient<symptom> loss<symptom> in somatosensory evoked potentials signals during anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF) C4-7 , which , was mainly attributed to shoulder traction using a special device. The signal loss returned immediately after the release of should traction. We discuss the importance of ION in ACDF , establishing proper baseline signals , and discuss steps to handle intraoperative signal changes.
