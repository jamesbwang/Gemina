 The natural history of postinjury among elderly trauma patients has not been well described. We hypothesized that elderly trauma patients would have lower admission hemoglobin ( Hb) levels , higher transfusion rates , and worse outcomes than young trauma patients. We performed a propensity-matched retrospective cohort analysis comparing elderly ( age â‰¥ 65 y) to young ( age 18-64) trauma patients matched by sex , mechanism of injury , Injury Severity Score , base deficit , comorbidities , operative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , and phlebotomy blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( n = 41/group). Outcomes included Hb trends , packed red blood cell ( PRBC) transfusion , length of stay , and mortality. Elderly patients had lower admission Hb ( 11.3 versus 10.2 g/dL , P = 0.012) , received more PRBC transfusions within 24 h ( 3.6 versus 1.8 units , P = 0.046) , and during admission ( 6.9 versus 4.3 units , P = 0.008). Despite receiving more PRBC transfusions and having similar operative and phlebotomy blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , elderly subjects had lower discharge Hb ( 9.0 versus 9.7 g/dL , P = 0.013). Elderly subjects had fewer ICU-free days ( 2.0 versus 6.0 d , P < 0.001) and higher in-hospital mortality ( 15 % versus 0 % , P = 0.026). Elderly trauma patients had lower admission Hb , received more transfusions , and had persistently lower Hb on discharge when controlling for injury severity , comorbid conditions , and blood<symptom> loss<symptom>. Aging may have a negative impact on postinjury anemia<symptom>.
