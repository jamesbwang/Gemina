 Although positive psychology interventions ( PPIs) show beneficial effects on mental health in non-clinical populations , the current literature is inconclusive regarding its effectiveness in clinical settings. We aimed to examine the effects of PPIs on well-being ( primary outcome) , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and stress ( secondary outcomes) in clinical samples with psychiatric or somatic disorders. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PsycINFO , PubMed , and Scopus were searched for controlled studies of PPIs in clinical samples between Jan 1 , 1998 and May 31 , 2017. Methodological quality of each study was rated. We used Hedges ' adjusted g to calculate effect sizes and pooled results using random-effect models. Thirty studies were included , representing 1864 patients with clinical disorders. At post-intervention , PPIs showed significant , small effect sizes for well-being ( Hedges ' g = 0.24) and depression<symptom> ( g = 0.23) compared to control conditions when omitting outliers. Significant moderate improvements were observed for anxiety<symptom> ( g = 0.36). Effect sizes for stress were not significant. Follow-up effects ( 8-12 weeks) , when available , yielded similar effect sizes. Quality of the studies was low to moderate. These findings indicate that PPIs , wherein the focus is on eliciting positive feelings , cognitions or behaviors , not only have the potential to improve well-being , but can also reduce distress in populations with clinical disorders. Given the growing interest for PPIs in clinical settings , more high quality research is warranted as to determine the effectiveness of PPIs in clinical samples. PROSPERO CRD42016037451.
