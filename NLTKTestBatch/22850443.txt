 The long-term effect of weight<symptom> reduction on skeletal health is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of an intensive medical weight<symptom> loss<symptom> intervention using very low energy diet ( VLED) ( ~ 800 cal/day) that result in significant changes in body<symptom> weight<symptom> , on total body bone mineral density ( BMD) over 2 years. We examined the impact of VLED-induced weight<symptom> loss<symptom> on BMD and FFM ( Fat-free Mass) after 3-6 months and again while in weight<symptom> maintenance at 2 years in 49 subjects. The effects of absolute and relative rate of weight<symptom> reduction assessed by change in weight<symptom> in kilograms were assessed using general linear modeling , with baseline BMD ( or FFM) as a covariate , and age , sex and changes<symptom> in body<symptom> weight<symptom> as primary model predictors. At the end of 2 years , the average weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was greater for men ( weight<symptom>: 23.51 ± 12.5 kg) than women ( weight<symptom>: 16.8 ± 19.2 kg) and BMD loss was greater among women ( 0.03 ± 0.04 g/cm Despite significant weight<symptom> loss<symptom> with VLED , there was only a small loss is BMD.
