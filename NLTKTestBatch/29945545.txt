 Low LET Ionizing radiation is known to alter intracellular redox balance by inducing free radical generation , which may cause oxidative modification of various cellular biomolecules. The extent of biomolecule-modifications/ damages and changes<symptom> in vital processes ( viz. cellular homeostasis , inter-/ intra-cellular signaling , mitochondrial physiology/dynamics antioxidant defence systems) are crucial which in turn determine fate of cells. In the present study , we expended TLR expressing ( normal/ transformed) and TLR null cells; and we have shown that mannan pretreatment in TLR expressing normal cells offers survival advantage against lethal doses of ionizing radiation. On the contrary , mannan pretreatment does not offer any protection against radiation to TLR null cells , NKE ρ ° cells and transformed cells. In normal cells , abrupt decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and endogenous ROS levels occurs following treatment with mannan. We intend to irradiate mannan-pretreated cells at a specific stage of perturbed mitochondrial functioning and ROS levels to comprehend if mannan pretreatment offers any survival advantage against radiation exposure to cells. Interestingly , pre-irradiation treatment of cells with mannan activates NFκB , p38 and JNK , alters mitochondrial physiology , increases expression of Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD , minimizes oxidation of mitochondrial phospholipids and offers survival advantage in comparison to irradiated group , in TLR expressing normal cells. The study demonstrates that TLR and mitochondrial ETC functions are inevitable in radio-protective efficacy exhibited by mannan.
