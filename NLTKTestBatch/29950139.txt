 Needle procedures are among the most distressing aspects of pediatric cancer-related treatment. Virtual reality ( VR) distraction offers promise for needle-related pain and distress given its highly immersive and interactive virtual environment. This study assessed the usability ( ease of use and understanding , acceptability) of a custom VR intervention for children with cancer undergoing implantable venous access device ( IVAD) needle insertion. Three iterative cycles of mixed-method usability testing with semistructured interviews were undertaken to refine the VR. Participants included 17 children and adolescents ( 8-18 years old) with cancer who used the VR intervention prior to or during IVAD access. Most participants reported the VR as easy to use ( 82 %) and understand ( 94 %) , and would like to use it during subsequent needle procedures ( 94 %). Based on usability testing , refinements were made to VR hardware , software , and clinical implementation. Refinements focused on increasing responsiveness , interaction , and immersion of the VR program , reducing head<disease><symptom> movement<symptom> for VR interaction , and enabling participant alerts to steps of the procedure by clinical staff. No adverse events of nausea<symptom> or dizziness<symptom> were reported. The VR intervention was deemed acceptable and safe. Next steps include assessing feasibility and effectiveness of the VR intervention for pain and distress.
