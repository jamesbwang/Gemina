 In this article , we review the cerebrovascular complications of sleep apnea ( SA). SA is the major sleep disorder associated with stroke and vascular dementia. Sleep apnea syndrome<symptom> of moderate<symptom> to severe intensity affects 17 % of 50-70-year-old men and 9 % of 50-70-year-old women , making SA a notorious and prevalent disorder. SA increases the risk of hypertension , stroke , myocardial infarction , and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) and is closely linked to vascular dementia. In addition , SA may worsen the neurologic outcome in acute stroke patients and interferes with rehabilitation after stroke. Proper management of SA may decrease the clinical impact of stroke risk factors , improve neurologic outcome after stroke , and lessen the progression of subcortical ischemic vascular disease<disease>. In this article , we will cover the most salient pathologies that associate SA and cerebrovascular pathology.
