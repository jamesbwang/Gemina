 High-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) can be divided into subfractions , which may have variable effects in atherogenesis. The results about the association between HDL-C subfractions and risk factors for cardiovascular disease<disease> are mixed. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between HDL-C subfractions and each metabolic syndrome<symptom> component , homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) and C-reactive protein ( CRP). Four thousand five hundred thirty-two individuals between 35 and 74 years old without previous manifest cardiovascular disease<disease> not using fibrates were enrolled. HDL-C subfractions were separated by vertical ultracentrifugation ( vertical auto profile-in mg/dL) into HDL Mean age of participants was 51 Â± 9 years , and 54.8 % were women. In univariate analysis , HDL-C , HDL HDL-C and its subfractions ( HDL
