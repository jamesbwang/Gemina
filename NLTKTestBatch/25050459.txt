 The effect of microchip pulsed electric field ( MPEF) treatment on lethal and sublethal injury of Pichia<pathogen> rhodanensis ( P. rhodanensis) were employed under 100-500 V for 20-100 pulses<symptom> and the underlying mechanism of MPEF treatment was investigated as well. A 6.48 log10 reduction of P. rhodanensis was achieved at 500V for 80 pulse. The fluorescent staining with Propidium Iodide ( PI) verified that the rate of sublethal injury cells maximum up to 27.2 % under 200 V. MPEF can cause the damage of cell morphology and ultrastructure , meanwhile causing a decrease in cellular enzymes , antioxidant enzyme activity and cell membrane fluidity. The leakage of intracellular compounds ( protein , nucleic acid , K + , Mg2 +) and Ca2 +- ATPase gradually increased as the growth of voltage , especially the proportion of protein in the supernatants increased from 2.0 % to 26.4 %. Flow cytometry analysis showed that MPEF has significant effect on membrane potential , but no obvious influence on non-specific esterase. MPEF can cause the changing of the secondary structure of protein , at the same time , double helix structure of DNA became loose and unwinding. These results provide a theoretical guidance for the widespread using of MPEF technology in the application of a non-thermal processing technique for food.
