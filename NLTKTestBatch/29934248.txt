 Performance in the executive function ( EF) domain has been linked to symptoms<symptom> and functional outcomes in psychosis. Studies have found that UHR populations have difficulty with verbal fluency , which involves multiple facets of EF. Two potentially implicated EF facets were examined to explore whether these could be dissociated in UHR populations: selection among alternatives ( measured by selection costs) and retrieval from semantic memory retrieval ( measured by retrieval costs). A total of 45 UHR individuals and 46 healthy controls ( HVs) were assessed with a verb generation task. Differences in selection cost ( RT difference between high and low selection demand conditions) and retrieval cost ( RT difference between high and low retrieval demand conditions) were examined and participants were also assessed for clinical symptoms<symptom>. The UHR group showed greater selection costs relative to HVs , F ( 1 , 91) = 4.39 , p = 0.039. However , there were no group differences on retrieval cost , F ( 1 , 91) = 0.63 , p = 0.43. A positive association ( r = 0.41) was found between disorganized and negative symptoms<symptom> and selection costs ( but not retrieval costs) in the UHR group. There was no significant association between selection costs and positive symptoms<symptom>. Increased selection costs may reflect impaired performance in the neural inhibition domain of EF in the UHR population , potentially underlying a mechanistically distinct EF subdomain that affects the group 's ability to efficiently select between competing options. Findings suggest that UHR individuals may exhibit impairment in selecting among alternatives , but not in retrieval from semantic memory.
