 Primary care physicians lack access to an objective cardiac function test. This study for the first time describes a novel cardiac output response to stress ( CORS) test developed to improve diagnosis and monitoring of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in primary care and investigates its reproducibility. Prospective observational study recruited 32 consecutive primary care patients ( age , 63 Â± 9 years; female , n = 18). Cardiac output was measured continuously using the bioreactance method in supine and standing positions and during two 3 min stages of a step-exercise protocol ( 10 and 15 steps per minute) using a 15 cm height bench. The CORS test was performed on two occasions , i.e. Test 1 and Test 2. There was no significant difference between repeated measures of cardiac output and stroke volume at supine standing and Stage 1 and Stage 2 step exercises ( all P > 0.3). There was a significant positive relationship between Test 1 and Test 2 cardiac outputs ( r = 0.92 , P = 0.01 with coefficient of variation of 7.1 %). The mean difference in cardiac output ( with upper and lower limits of agreement) between Test 1 and Test 2 was 0.1 ( -1.9 to 2.1) L/min , combining supine , standing , and step-exercise data. The CORS , as a novel test for objective evaluation of cardiac function , demonstrates acceptable reproducibility and can potentially be implemented in primary care.
