 Family-focused practice improves outcomes for families where parents have a mental illness. However , there is limited understanding regarding the factors that predict and enable these practices. This study aimed to identify factors that predict and enable mental health nurses ' family-focused practice. A sequential mixed methods design was used. A total of 343 mental health nurses , practicing in 12 mental health services ( in acute inpatient and community settings) , throughout Ireland completed the Family Focused Mental<symptom> Health Practice Questionnaire , measuring family-focused behaviours and other factors that impact family-focused activities. Hierarchical multiple regression identified 14 predictors of family-focused practice. The most important predictors noted were nurses ' skill and knowledge , own parenting experience , and work setting ( i.e. community). Fourteen nurses , who achieved high scores on the questionnaire , subsequently participated in semistructured interviews to elaborate on enablers of family-focused practice. Participants described drawing on their parenting experiences to normalize parenting challenges , encouraging service users to disclose parenting concerns , and promoting trust. The opportunity to visit a service user 's home allowed them to observe how the parent was coping and forge a close relationship with them. Nurses ' personal characteristics and work setting are key factors in determining family-focused practice. This study extends current research by clearly highlighting predictors of family-focused practice and reporting how various enablers promoted family-focused practice. The capacity of nurses to support families has training , organizational and policy implications within adult mental health services in Ireland and elsewhere.
