 High rates of depression<symptom> are observed in Parkinson 's disease<disease> , and limited access to care complicates management. The purpose of this pilot project was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of a personalized cognitive-behavioral telemedicine program for depression<symptom> in Parkinson 's disease<disease> ( dPD). Thirty-four individuals with dPD and their carepartners participated in this pilot study. A 10-module self-help workbook , tailored to the unique needs of the dPD population , was created to be used as either a stand-alone intervention , with minimal therapist support , or a supplement to formal telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions. Improvements in depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , quality of life , sleep , negative thoughts , and caregiver burden were observed over the course of the 4-month study , independent of treatment modality ( guided self-help vs formal telephone-based psychotherapy). Future research will utilize randomized controlled designs and continue to focus on delivery models that can improve access to this and other evidence-based mental health interventions for dPD.
