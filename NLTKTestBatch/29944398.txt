 Streptococcal bacterial species represent common inhabitants of the intestinal tract<symptom> of animals and humans with a potential for opportunistic infections<disease>. Streptococcosis has been identified in turkey poults ( Meleagris gallopavo) , ducklings and goslings ( Anatidae) , broiler chickens , semimature-adult chickens ( Gallus gallus domesticus) , and young and adult pigeons ( Columbidae). However , the exact underlying factors that lead to bacterial invasion of the blood stream and tissue colonization have not been completely elucidated. The electronic database of the California Animal Health and Food Safety laboratory ( Fresno , Tulare , and Turlock branches) was searched for necropsy<disease> cases in which streptococcosis was diagnosed in different avian species between January 2000 and August 2017. A total of 95 cases , involving both commercial operations and noncommercial premises , were analyzed. Streptococcus<pathogen> spp. , Streptococcus<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> , and Streptococcus<pathogen> gallolyticus<pathogen> were identified from multiple<symptom> organs , with macroscopic or histopathologic lesions<symptom> ( or both) indicative of septicemia<disease> in 23 ( 24 %) , 40 ( 42 %) , and 30 ( 32 %) cases , respectively. Streptococcus<pathogen> pluranimalium and Streptococcus<pathogen> lutetiensis<pathogen> were also isolated from one ( 1 %) and two ( 2 %) cases , respectively. Turkey poults , broiler chickens , and ducklings were the most-commonly affected species with streptococcosis. Splenitis and hepatitis<pathogen> were the most-common lesions<symptom> observed and these were the organs with the highest isolation rate. An overview of the clinical and pathologic presentation , and possible predisposing conditions associated with this bacterial infection<disease> , is provided.
