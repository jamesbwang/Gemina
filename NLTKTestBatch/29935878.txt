 To assess whether prolonged neonatal cholestasis , described in congenital hypopituitarism and septo-optic dysplasia ( SOD) , is associated with altered expression of selected canalicular ectoenzymes and canalicular transport proteins. Children with congenital hypopituitarism ( n = 21) , SOD ( n = 18) , and cholestasis seen in our center over 26 years were reviewed. Histopathologic findings in archival liver biopsy specimens were assessed ( n = 10) and in those with low/normal levels of serum γ-glutamyltransferase ( GGT) activity despite conjugated hyperbilirubinemia , expression of canalicular ectoenzymes and canalicular transport proteins was evaluated immunohistochemically. Patients presented at a median age of 8 weeks ( range 3-20 weeks) with median total bilirubin 116 µmol/L ( 45-287 µmol/L) , GGT 95 IU/L ( 25-707 UI/L) , and serum cortisol 51 nmol/L ( 17-240 nmol/L). All but 3 had low free thyroxin ( median 9.6 pmol/L ( 6.8-26.9)) with increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels ( median 5.95 mU/L ( < 0.1-9.24)). Liver histologic features included moderate-to-severe intralobular cholestasis with nonspecific hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> , giant-cell transformation of hepatocytes , and fibrosis<disease>. In all , immunohistochemical staining for canalicular ectoenzymes and canalicular transport proteins revealed a degree of reduced expression , associated with normal serum GGT values in 6 of the 10 patients , and another 6 nonbiopsied infants with cholestasis also had low/normal serum GGT activity. Sequencing of ABCB11 and ATP8B1 performed in 6 of the biopsied patients did not identify pathogenic mutations. Following replacement therapy , biochemical evidence of hepatobiliary injury resolved in all children within a median period of 6 months. Hepatobiliary involvement in congenital hypopituitarism associated with SOD has a good prognosis , but its etiology remains uncertain. Immunohistochemical expression of canalicular transport proteins was reduced in available liver samples.
