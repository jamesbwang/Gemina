 Tenecteplase ( TNK-tPA) is a promising third-generation plasminogen activator , because of its greater fibrin specificity and longer half-life than alteplase. There is a paucity of studies on intravenous thrombolysis using TNK-tPA in developing countries. The present study has been undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of TNK-tPA with alteplase. Two studies were conducted. Study I was an open-label , randomized study in which two doses of TNK-tPA ( 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) were compared. Study II was an open-label study in which TNK-tPA 0.2 mg/kg bolus was compared with historical controls. The primary endpoint for study I and study II was an improvement of ≥ 8 points or a score of 0 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS) ( major neurological improvement ( MNI)) at 24 h. Secondary endpoints for both studies were neurological improvement as assessed using the NIHSS score , modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) score and the Barthel Index ( BI) on days 7 , 30 and 90. Minimal disability was defined as an mRS score of 0 or 1 and good functional recovery as a BI score of 50-90. Safety was assessed by the proportion of patients having symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( sICH) within 36 h and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> at 48 h after treatment. In study I , 20 patients received 0.1 mg/kg and 30 received 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA. There was no significant difference in MNI at 24 h between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA doses. The patients given 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA had a significantly better 3-month outcome ( minimal disability , p = 0.007). There was no sICH in study I. In study II , 62 patients ( one lost to follow-up) received 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA. MNI was noted in ten patients ( 16.4 %) , 3-month minimal disability was noted in 37 patients ( 60.7 %) , and good functional recovery was seen in 33 patients ( 54.1 %). sICH occurred in one patient , and four patients died. Pooled data of patients in study I and study II receiving 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA were compared with data from the historical National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ( NINDS) trial. For comparison , the primary endpoint of the NINDS trial ( improvement on NIHSS of ≥ 4 points or a score of 0 at 24 h) was taken. The primary endpoint though was not significantly different ( 58.2 % vs. 47 % , p = 0.08) , but with TNK-tPA , greater neurological improvement , minimal disability ( 70.3 vs. 39 % , p < 0.001) and good functional recovery ( 36.3 vs. 16 % , p < 0.001) was noted at 3 months. There was a lower incidence of sICH ( 1.1 vs. 6.4 % , p = 0.05) and lower 3-month mortality ( 5.5 vs. 17 % , p = 0.01) noted with TNK-tPA compared with alteplase. Intravenous TNK-tPA 0.2 mg/kg administered within 3 hours of symptom<symptom> onset seems to be well tolerated and effective option in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
