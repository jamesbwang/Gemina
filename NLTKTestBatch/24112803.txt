 The tumor microenvironment ( TME) plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and cancer cell metastasis. Accordingly , a drug-delivery system ( DDS) that is capable of targeting tumor and releasing drugs in response to TME-associated stimuli should lead to potent antitumor efficacy. Here , a cancer targeting , reactive oxygen species ( ROS)- responsive drug delivery vehicle as an example of a TME-targeting DDS is reported. Tumor targeting is achieved using biotin as a ligand for `` biotin transporter ''- overexpressing malignant tumors , and bilirubin-based nanoparticles ( BRNPs) are used as a drug-delivery carrier that enables ROS-responsive drug release. Doxorubicin-loaded , biotinylated BRNPs ( Dox@bt-BRNPs) with size of â‰ˆ 100 nm are prepared by a one-step self-assembly process. Dox@bt-BRNPs exhibit accelerated Dox-release behavior in response to ROS and show specific binding as well as anticancer activity against biotin transporter-overexpressing HeLa cells in vitro. bt-BRNPs labeled with cypate , near-infrared dye , show much greater accumulation at tumor sites in HeLa tumor-bearing mice than BRNPs lacking the biotin ligand. Finally , intravenous injection of Dox@bt-BRNPs into HeLa tumor-bearing mice results in greater antitumor efficacy compared with free Dox , bt-BRNPs only , and Dox@BRNPs without causing any appreciable body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. Collectively , these findings suggest that bt-BRNPs hold potential as a new TME-responsive DDS for effectively treating various tumors.
