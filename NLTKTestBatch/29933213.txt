 Frontal EEG asymmetry , relatively greater left-than-right frontal activity ( rLFA) , has been associated with mood symptoms<symptom> and approach versus withdrawal behaviors. Distress tolerance ( DT) , a transdiagnostic behavior , has yet to be examined as an approach behavior using rLFA. Adolescents ( N = 20; M age = 14.53 , SD = 2.09) completed a frustrating mirror-tracing task which provided an index of DT. Higher resting rLFA was associated with lower DT. The results are the first to identify a relationship between cortical activation and distress tolerance in adolescents. rLFA appears to be a neurophysiological index of behaviors associated with approach motivation and escape from punishment or aversive situations.
