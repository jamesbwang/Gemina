 Oxidative stress and inflammation are intricately interlinked as aetiological factors in the context of ageing and chronic disease-related accelerated ageing. Previous research by our group has highlighted the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of grape-derived polyphenols in the context of acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and oxidative stress. The aim here was to add to this by assessing efficacy of the treatment ( acutely) to address ageing-associated cumulative pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory changes in an in vitro model. Blood from young and aged humans was analysed for baseline oxidative stress and inflammatory status<symptom>. Isolated neutrophils were acutely exposed to the polyphenol treatment in vitro. The chemokinetic capacity of treated and control neutrophils in response to fMLP was subsequently determined in a Dunn chamber , using live cell imaging. Neutrophils were also analysed for the expression of selected molecular markers associated with functional capacity and oxidative stress. Results indicate that the aged population had significantly worse oxidative stress and inflammatory profiles ( higher plasma conjugated dienes and MPO) than young controls. Neutrophils isolated from both young and aged individuals had improved chemokinetic accuracy and capacity after in vitro polyphenol treatment. Additionally , increased shedding of CD16 and expression of CD66b suggested sites via which the polyphenol achieved improved neutrophil motility. We conclude that grape seed-derived polyphenols facilitated improved neutrophil functionality by acting on the molecular targets elucidated here.
