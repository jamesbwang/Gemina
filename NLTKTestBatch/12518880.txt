 Inactivated and subunit bovine viral diarrhea<disease><symptom> virus<pathogen> ( BVDV) vaccines have shown limited protective efficacy. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine containing both inactivated BVDV ( iBVDV) and baculovirus-expressed recombinant E2 ( rE2) , an important BVDV antigen with strongly neutralizing epitopes. Four groups of goats were immunized twice with one of four vaccine preparations: 1) iBVDV + rE2 , 2) rE2 , 3) iBVDV , and 4) saline , and challenged with BVDV. For goats vaccinated with the iBVDV + rE2 vaccine , no viremia was observed after challenge , and clinical signs , pyrexia , and leukopenia<symptom> were reduced compared to the saline group. In contrast , for goats vaccinated with either iBVDV or rE2 alone , viremia was still detectable. The combination of iBVDV and rE2 elicited stronger protective immune responses against BVDV than iBVDV or rE2 alone.
