 Multiple Sclerosis ( MS) is a chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> of the central nervous system ( CNS) characterized by demyelination and axonal loss. Demyelinating lesions<symptom> are associated with infiltrating T lymphocytes , bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM) , and activated resident microglia. Tissue damage is thought to be mediated by T cell produced cytokines and chemokines , which activate microglia and/or BMDM to both strip myelin and produce toxic factors , ultimately damaging axons and promoting disability. However , the relative contributions of BMDM and microglia to demyelinating pathology are unclear , as their identification in MS tissue is difficult due to similar morphology and indistinguishable surface markers when activated. The CD4 T cell-induced autoimmune murine model of MS , experimental autoimmune encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> ( EAE) , in which BMDM are essential for demyelination , has revealed pathogenic and repair-promoting phenotypes associated with BMDM and microglia , respectively. Using a murine model of demyelination induced by a gliatropic coronavirus<pathogen> , in which BMDM are redundant for demyelination , we herein characterize gene expression profiles of BMDM versus microglia associated with demyelination. While gene expression in CNS infiltrating BMDM was upregulated early following infection and subsequently sustained , microglia expressed a more dynamic gene profile with extensive mRNA upregulation coinciding with peak demyelination after viral control. This delayed microglia response comprised a highly pro-inflammatory and phagocytic profile. Furthermore , while BMDM exhibited a mixed phenotype of M1 and M2 markers , microglia repressed the vast majority of M2-markers. Overall , these data support a pro-inflammatory and pathogenic role of microglia temporally remote from viral control , whereas BMDM retained their gene expression profile independent of the changing environment. As demyelination is caused by multifactorial insults , our results highlight the plasticity of microglia in responding to distinct inflammatory settings , which may be relevant for MS pathogenesis.
