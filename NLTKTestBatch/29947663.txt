 This study aimed to describe the growth parameters of Anchoa tricolor in a subtropical estuary. From August 2010 to July 2011 , 10.009 specimens of the anchovy Anchoa tricolor , mean total length 4.2 cm ( ± 1.45) , were captured in the intertidal region of the Estuarine Complex of Paranaguá ( 25º 15 '- 25 ° 35 ' S and 48 ° 20 '- 48 ° 45 ' W). Species 's weight/length relationship for grouped genders was described as follow: W = 0.0000591. Lt3 .282 ( length in centimeters; weight<symptom> in grams) showing a positive allometric growth pattern ( b > 3; P = 0.000). Significant differences concerning weight/length relationship for males , females and unsexed individuals were identified. Parameters of the length to age growth curve were estimated by adjusting a von Bertalanffy growth equation from aged individuals from a length-frequency distribution: L ∞ = 10.06 ( 1-e-17715 ( t + 0.205)) ( length in centimeters , age in years). The age to attain 95 % of the asymptotic length ( A95; longevity sensu Taylor) was estimated at 1.7 years. Size frequency distributions indicate that A. tricolor uses the estuarine area as reproductive and growing grounds , especially during the first year of the life cycle , where the species represent a key element for ecosystem functioning due to relatively high abundance and energy transference from plankton to top predators.
