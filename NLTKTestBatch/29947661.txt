 This study aimed to identify birth clusters according to type of hospital ( SUS vs. non-SUS) and the existence of differences in socioeconomic , maternal , neonatal , and healthcare access characteristics , measured by the distance between the mothers ' homes and the hospitals where they gave birth. Births<symptom> to mothers residing in the city of São Paulo , Brazil , in 2010 were georeferenced and allocated in 310 weighting areas from the population census , in addition to classifying them according to hospital of birth ( SUS vs. non-SUS). Spatial clusters were identified through the spatial sweep technique for spatial dependence of SUS and non-SUS births<symptom> , leading to the formation of ten SUS clusters and seven non-SUS clusters. Births<symptom> in non-SUS hospitals formed clusters in the city 's central area , with a lower proportion of low-income households. The SUS birth clusters were located on the outskirts of the city , where there are more households in subnormal clusters. Both SUS and non-SUS clusters were not internally homogeneous , showing differences in maternal age , schooling , and number of prenatal visits and very premature newborns. The theoretical mean distance traveled by mothers to the hospital was 51.8 % lower in the SUS clusters ( 5.1 km) than in the non-SUS clusters ( 9.8 km). The formation of birth clusters showed differences in maternal , pregnancy , childbirth , and neonatal characteristics , in addition to displaying a radial-concentric spatial distribution , reflecting the city 's prevailing socioeconomic differences. The shorter distance in SUS births<symptom> indicates regionalization of childbirth care in the city of São Paulo.
