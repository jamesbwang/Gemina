 We used vignettes to explore hospitalized HF patients ' self-care decisions. Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> ( HF) self-care is integral to maintain and manage health , and may prevent unnecessary HF hospitalizations. Nevertheless , self-care remains challenging for patients , and using vignettes offers a new perspective to understand patient HF self-care decision making. This qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted as part of a mixed methods study. We conducted semi-structured interviews ( N = 20) to elicit patient decisions about self-care in responses to three vignettes , which varied in symptom<symptom> severity. Content analysis was used to extract quotes describing participant responses. Participants were on average 60 years old , primarily male , African American , unemployed , and highly symptomatic ( NYHA Class III or IV). Overall , participants were able to identify when symptoms<symptom> required a decision to seek urgent medical attention , but had difficulty identifying the appropriate decision to make in response to less acute symptoms<symptom> such as swelling. Symptoms<symptom> other than shortness of breath were challenging for patients to interpret and manage appropriately. Understanding how to apply HF knowledge to alleviate symptoms<symptom> was also difficult. Vignettes may be a helpful tool to prompt patient-health care provider communication about self-care management , and prompt discussions about appropriate self-care decisions in response to varying levels of symptom<symptom> severity.
