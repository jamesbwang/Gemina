 Down syndrome<symptom> , caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 , is the single most common risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer 's disease<disease>. Worldwide approximately 6 million people have Down syndrome<symptom> , and all these individuals will develop the hallmark amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer 's disease<disease> by the age of 40 and the vast majority will go on to develop dementia. Triplication of APP , a gene on chromosome 21 , is sufficient to cause early-onset Alzheimer 's disease<disease> in the absence of Down syndrome<symptom>. However , whether triplication of other chromosome 21 genes influences disease<disease> pathogenesis in the context of Down syndrome<symptom> is unclear. Here we show , in a mouse model , that triplication of chromosome 21 genes other than APP increases amyloid-β aggregation , deposition of amyloid-β plaques and worsens associated cognitive deficits. This indicates that triplication of chromosome 21 genes other than APP is likely to have an important role to play in Alzheimer 's disease<disease> pathogenesis in individuals who have Down syndrome<symptom>. We go on to show that the effect of trisomy of chromosome 21 on amyloid-β aggregation correlates with an unexpected shift in soluble amyloid-β 40/42 ratio. This alteration in amyloid-β isoform ratio occurs independently of a change in the carboxypeptidase activity of the γ-secretase complex , which cleaves the peptide from APP , or the rate of extracellular clearance of amyloid-β. These new mechanistic insights into the role of triplication of genes on chromosome 21 , other than APP , in the development of Alzheimer 's disease<disease> in individuals who have Down syndrome<symptom> may have implications for the treatment of this common cause of neurodegeneration.
