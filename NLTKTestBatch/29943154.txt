 Psoriasis is an immune-mediated dermatosis with a wide genetic predisposition. The immunogenetic background , specifically interactions between human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) class I ligands and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ( KIRs) , have functional significance in modulating natural killer ( NK) cells and can influence susceptibility and response to biological therapy. The main aim of this study was to correlate HLA-A and- B KIR ligands with response to biological therapy in patients with psoriasis. HLA-A and- B polymorphisms were determined in 48 patients ( 35 males and 13 females) , with a mean of 22 years of disease<disease> ( range 8-55). All patients were treated with biological therapy ( adalimumab , etanercept , infliximab , or ustekinumab) for at least 6 months. This study identifies , with statistical significance , the presence of at least one ligand HLA-A Bw4-80I in the `` poor-responder '' population ( patients who needed two or more biologics) compared with the `` responder '' population ( patients with good response after a single biological drug) ( 47.62 vs. 11.11 %; p = 0.006) as well as in `` non-responders to etanercept '' compared with `` responders to etanercept '' ( 52.63 vs. 5 %; p = 0.001). Our preliminary results suggest that at least one ligand HLA-A Bw4-80I could be associated with `` difficult-to-treat '' psoriasis and that this ligand may reduce the probability of response to etanercept , producing more tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- Î± and neutralizing NK activity through a predominance of activating KIR. The ab initio identification of genetic markers of response to biologic therapy could improve the efficacy and economic impact of these agents.
