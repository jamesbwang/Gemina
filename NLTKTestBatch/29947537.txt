 Hypertension in obesity is associated with increased insulin resistance , vascular mass and body mass index ( BMI). The purpose of the study was to visualize endothelin-1 ( ET-1) mediated constriction in arteries isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese hypertensive women previously operated by gastric bypass. Functional studies were conducted in a microvascular myograph. Expressed as percentage of contraction elicited by 124 mM KCl concentration-response curves for ET-1 were shifted leftward in arteries from obese hypertensive patients compared to healthy normotensive subjects. The vasodilator response to the ET-1 antagonist BQ123 ( 1 microM) was significantly higher in arteries from obese hypertensive patients ( p < 0.001). BQ123 induced relaxation was inhibited by NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME ( 0.1 nM). Preincubation with BQ123 enhanced the relaxation induced by acetylcholine ( ACh; 0.1 nM- 0.1 mM) ( p < 0.001) , but not that induced by NO donor sodium nitroprusside ( SNP; 0.1 nM- 0.1 mM) , in arteries from obese hypertensive patients. The present study show that hypertension yet prevail after gastric bypass surgery and the ET ( A) receptor antagonist BQ123 may be a useful tool in reducing blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in obese hypertensive patients.
