 Previous studies have shown that in many wireless sensor network applications the IEEE 802.15.4 carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance ( CSMA/CA) mechanism with default parameters can not guarantee the constraints of reliability , time efficiency , or energy efficiency. Although many adaptive parameter tuning algorithms have been proposed , many of them can not correctly identify the changes of the network condition and are unable to effectively perform the parameter tuning operation. Considering the randomness that CSMA/CA brings about , for most of the proposed algorithms , it is a challenge to distinguish significant violations that were caused by actual changes of the network from the general fluctuations<symptom> that were due to CSMA/CA. In this paper , we propose a lightweight algorithm called the network equivalent adaptive parameter tuning ( NEAPT) algorithm. It is fully distributed and can work without any predefined information or acknowledgement. NEAPT not only takes reliability as an evaluation of a network condition , but it proposes a synthetic value , called the
