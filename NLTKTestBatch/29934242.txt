 Depression<symptom> poses a significant public health burden , with varying prevalence by race/ethnicity , gender , and socioeconomic status ( SES). It is unclear whether race/ethnicity and gender modify relationships between SES and depression<symptom>. The purpose of this study was to investigate such effect modification. A cross-sectional analysis was performed on Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis participants at the baseline ( n = 5559). Multivariable logistic regression models stratified by race/ethnicity and gender were performed to evaluate associations between income , education , occupation , and neighborhood SES with depressive symptoms<symptom> , defined by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression<symptom> Scale values of 16 or greater. Depressive symptom<symptom> odds were lower with increasing income , and this was pronounced in white women , black men , and Hispanic women. Lower odds of depressive symptoms<symptom> were seen in management/professional occupations for Hispanic men , and in blacks as neighborhood SES increased. Education was not associated with odds of depressive symptoms<symptom>. Multiplicative interaction terms were significant for gender-income ( P = .028) and race/ethnicity-neighborhood ( P = .010). Race/ethnicity-neighborhood interaction was also observed on the additive scale. Associations varied across races/ethnicities and gender , and evidence for effect modification was seen by gender with income , and by race/ethnicity with neighborhood SES. These findings provide a nuanced understanding of race/ethnicity and gender differences in SES related to depressive symptoms<symptom>.
