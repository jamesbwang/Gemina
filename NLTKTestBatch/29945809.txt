 Osteochondroplastic tracheobronchopathy ( OCTB) is a rare disorder of unknown cause that affects the tracheobronchial tree. It is characterized by multiple cartilaginous formations or bone nodules<disease> projecting into the tracheal or proximal bronchial lumen. It is usually asymptomatic because of the slow progression of the nodules<disease>. However , chronic<symptom> cough<symptom> , recurrent hemoptysis<symptom> or recurrent respiratory<disease> infections<disease>infections<disease> have been reported. We describe the cases of three patients with symptomatic OCTB: two men and one woman consulting for bronchial infections<disease> or pneumonia<disease> with sputum<symptom> difficulties ( 2 cases) or simply for chronic<symptom> cough<symptom> ( 1 case). In all three cases , the diagnosis was suspected because of irregularities of the tracheal or bronchial wall with calcification seen on imaging and confirmed at bronchoscopy with biopsy specimens. No specific therapy was initiated in these patients except for the treatment of associated complications or comorbidities. OCTB is a benign pathology which can lead to bronchial symptoms<symptom> ranging from mild<symptom> cough<symptom> to severe airway obstruction due to tracheobronchial stenosis. A key to diagnosis , limiting non-essential examinations and biopsies , is to consider OCTB based on CT scan or bronchoscopy based on irregularities of the tracheal or bronchial wall with calcification.
