 14-3-3s are phospho-binding proteins with scaffolding activity that play central roles in the regulation of enzymes and signaling complexes in eukaryotes. In plants , 14-3-3 isoforms are required for disease<disease> resistance and key targets of pathogen effectors. Here , we examined the requirement of the tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum) 14-3-3 ( TFT) protein family for Xv3 disease<disease> resistance in response to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas<pathogen> euvesicatoria. In addition , we determined if tomato 14-3-3 proteins interact with the repertoire of X. euvesicatoria type III secretion effector proteins , including AvrXv3 the elicitor of Xv3 resistance. We show that multiple tomato 14-3-3 isoforms contribute to Xv3 resistance. We also show that one or more tomato 14-3-3s physically interact with multiple effectors ( AvrXv3 , XopE1 , XopE2 , XopN , XopO , XopQ , and XopAU). Genetic analyses indicate that none of the identified effectors interfere with AvrXv3-elicited resistance into Xv3 tomato leaves; however , XopE1 , XopE2 and XopO are required to suppress symptom<symptom> development in susceptible tomato leaves. Phospho-peptide mapping revealed that XopE2 is phosphorylated at multiple residues in planta and residues T66 , T131 and S334 are required for maximal binding to TFT10. Together , our data support the hypothesis that multiple tomato 14-3-3 isoforms are involved in immune signaling during X. euvesicatoria infection<disease>.
