 Adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH)- dependent Cushing syndrome<symptom> is rarely caused by a pheochromocytoma. We present a case of a 46-year-old woman who developed severe hypertension , hypokalemia , and typical Cushingoid features. Investigations revealed extremely high metanephrine , cortisol , and ACTH levels. Imaging showed a 3.8-cm left adrenal mass. Preoperative control of hypertension and hypokalemia was very challenging. The patient was cured after surgical removal of the adrenal mass. We followed this by a review of the literature using the databases Google Scholar and PubMed. A total of 58 cases have been reported to date. In summary , ACTH-producing pheochromocytoma is a rare condition that poses a clinical challenge in the perioperative period. It is important that physicians be aware of such a condition because early recognition and treatment are crucial to decrease morbidity and mortality.
