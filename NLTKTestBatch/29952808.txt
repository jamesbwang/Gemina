 This study aimed to analyze the isolated role of unsupported arm activities and the physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> and dynamic hyperinflation ( DH) induced by activities of daily living in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<disease>. Physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> and DH were compared using the Glittre activities of daily living test ( TGlittre) and a modified protocol that emphasized unsupported arm activities and excluded squats and bending down to move objects on shelves ( TGlittre-M). Data were also compared from the isolated shelf tasks of TGlittre ( TSHELF) and TGlittre-M ( TSHELF-M). This cross-sectional study included 30 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<disease> who performed the TGlittre , TGlittre-M , TSHELF and TSHELF-M. The physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> were evaluated during the 4 protocols and inspiratory capacity was measured before and immediately after the tests for evaluation of DH. Patients had higher oxygen uptake , ventilatory demand , dyspnea<symptom> , and DH in the TGlittre than in the TGlittre-M ( mean differences: 123 ± 119 mL/min; 0.11 ± 0.10 , 1 ( -1 to 3) , and- 0.14 ± 0.22 , respectively; P < .05 for all). Oxygen uptake , ventilatory demand , and dyspnea<symptom> were also higher in the TSHELF than in the TSHELF-M ( mean differences: 408 ± 185 mL/min; 0.26 ± 0.17; 1 ( -1 to 3) , respectively; P < .05 for all). However , DH was similar for both tasks ( P > .05). In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<disease> , the physiological demands during unsupported arm activities were lower than during the task performed with squatting and bending down; however , the magnitude of DH did not differ between them. These results suggest that the isolated arm activities contribute less to the TGlittre 's physiological requirement than the lower-limb and trunk activities.
