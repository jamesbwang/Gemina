 The aim of this study was to apply texture analysis ( TA) on paraspinal musculature in T2-weighted ( T2w) magnetic resonance images ( MRI) of symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS) patients and correlate the findings with clinical outcome measures. Ninety patients were prospectively enrolled in the multi-centric Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study ( LSOS). All patients received a T2w MRI , from which we selected axial images perpendicular to the intervertebral disc at level L3/4 for TA. Regions-of-interest ( ROI) were drawn of the paraspinal musculature and 304 TA features/ ROI were calculated. As clinical outcome measurements , we analysed three commonly applied measures: Spinal Stenosis Measure ( SSM) , Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ) , as well as the Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS). We used two machine learning-based classifiers: Decision table , and k-nearest neighbours ( k-NN). We observed no meaningful correlation between TA in paraspinal musculature and the two clinical outcome measures SSM symptoms<symptom> and SSM function , while a moderate correlation was observed regarding the outcome measures RMDQ ( k-NN: r = 0.56) and NRS ( Decision Table: r = 0.72). In conclusion , MR TA is a viable tool to quantify medical images and illustrate correlations of microarchitectural changes invisible to a human reader with potential clinical impact. • TA is feasible on paraspinal musculature using MRI. • TA on paraspinal musculature correlates with SSM and RMDQ. • TA may enable a statement regarding clinical impact of imaging findings.
