 A recent randomized controlled trial found that an intervention focused on developing an exercise habit increased weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA) over 8 wk compared to a control group. The purpose of the current study was to test if changes in habit , as well as other behavioral strategy constructs from the Multi-Process Action Control Test , mediated between group condition and MVPA ( self-report and accelerometry). Inactive new gym members ( N = 94) were randomized into control or experimental ( habit-building) groups. No construct entirely explained mediation condition ( experimental and control) and changes<symptom> in MVPA measured by accelerometry. Self-report MVPA found affective judgments , behavioral regulation , and preparatory habit to be mediated between group ( experimental/control conditions) and changes<symptom> in behavior ( Î² = 0.36 , 95 % confidence interval ( .05-.78)). Self-reported and objectively measured behavior models demonstrated complete and partial mediation , respectively. New gym members could benefit from successful behavioral enactment by developing constructs to support habit formation.
