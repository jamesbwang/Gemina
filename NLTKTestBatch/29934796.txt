 Mycoplasma<pathogen> ovis is a small , pleiotropic bacterium<pathogen> , which parasitizes the external surface of erythrocytes of several species of artiodactyl mammals , especially sheep and goats. We here report an outbreak of ovine mycoplasmosis in a sheep flock of a private ranch ( Universidad Veracruzana) in Veracruz , Mexico. For the identification of Mycoplasma<pathogen> and other hemoparasitic bacterial agents , we stained blood smears with the DiffQuick Â® technique and additionally amplified several fragments of 16S rDNA gene. We detected the presence of morulas in erythrocytes from 30 sick female adult sheep , and found Mycoplasma<pathogen> ovis DNA in all of them. Furthermore , three of these animals also tested positive for Anaplasma<pathogen> ovis. Our findings represent the first record of M. ovis and A. ovis in an outbreak of hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> in a sheep flock , leading to severe livestock loss in a ranch of Mexico. This study highlights the importance of establishing an active surveillance of both pathogens in the country.
