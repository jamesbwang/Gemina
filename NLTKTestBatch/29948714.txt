 As a universal environmental contaminant , the herbicide cyhalofop-butyl is considered to have infested effects on the embryonic development of aquatic species. The present study focused on an assessment of the impacts of cyhalofop-butyl on Yellow River carp embryos. It was found that cyhalofop-butyl inhibited the hatching of the embryos , and the hatching rate decreased with higher concentrations of the herbicide. The mortality rate was increased on exposure to cyhalofop-butyl and was significantly higher in the 1.6 and 2 mg/L treatment groups over 48 h. All of the embryos of the 2 mg/L treatment group died within the 48 h post-hatching stage. And the transcription of several embryos related to apoptosis was also influenced by cyhalofop-butyl exposure. Further , cyhalofop-butyl exposure leads to a series of morphological changes ( pericardial<symptom> edema<symptom> , tail deformation , and spine deformation) in embryos , which were consistent with significant modifications in the associated genes. These results provided a scientific basis for further studies into the effects of cyhalofop-butyl on aquatic organisms.
