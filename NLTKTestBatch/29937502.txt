 A plenoptic cameras is a sensor that records the 4D light-field distribution of target scenes. The surface errors of a microlens array ( MLA) can cause the degradation and distortion of the raw image captured by a plenoptic camera , resulting in the confusion<symptom> or loss of light-field information. To address this issue , we propose a method for the local rectification of distorted images using white light-field images. The method consists of microlens center calibration , geometric rectification , and grayscale rectification. The scope of its application to different sized errors and the rectification accuracy of three basic surface errors , including the overall accuracy and the local accuracy , are analyzed through simulation of imaging experiments. The rectified images have a significant improvement in quality , demonstrating the provision of precise light-field data for reconstruction of real objects.
