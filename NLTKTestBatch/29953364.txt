 Solid-state fermentation ( SSF) with the medicinal higher Basidiomycete Ganoderma lucidum was studied as a strategy to use pine ( Pinus radiata D. Don) and poplar ( Populus nigra L.) wood chips and sawdust. Fruiting bodies were produced and the value of the biotransformed substrate was assessed. The highest mushroom yield ( 63 g dry<symptom> weight<symptom> per kilogram of dry substrate) was obtained with poplar sawdust and wood chips. Immersion of the bioreactors was a simple watering method that obtained suitable yields. Two morphological types were induced using 2 different incandescent light intensities. High light irradiation induced the highest valued mushroom morphology ( as a whole product). Time course study of substrate biodegradation and mycelial growth dynamics indicated that the trophophase lasted 20 days and presented laccase activity of 0.01-0.03 units Â· g-1. The activity at idiophase was 10 times higher. Aqueous and alkali extracts , as well as carbohydrase enzyme profile activity , revealed differences in the properties of the residual substrate; some related to the substrate source are considered to be of concern for further use of this pretreated biomass. In view of the results obtained , we propose use of SSF of pine and poplar with G. lucidum to profitably recycle softwood by-products from the timber industry.
