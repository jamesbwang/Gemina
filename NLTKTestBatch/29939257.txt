 Although the endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD) has been established to be more efficacious in the treatment of superficial gastrointestinal neoplasia than the piecemeal resection , its use is still limited due to the concern about serious adverse events particularly in the west<disease>. Newer ESD knives have been developed that have been said to be safer than the first-generation devices. We aimed to report a Western single center experience regarding the initial safety and performance of ESD for superficial esophageal neoplasia treated with the Clutch Cutter ( DP2618DT; Fujifilm Corporation , Tokyo , Japan). Our main outcome was safety in terms of bleeding or perforation. Secondary outcomes included en bloc resection and the R0 resection. Fourteen patients with superficial esophageal neoplasia underwent 15 ESDs using the Clutch Cutter. The mean age was 65 ± 16.7 years and 10 ( 71.4 %) males. Eight ( 57 %) patients had esophageal adenocarcinoma , 3 ( 21.4 %) had high-grade dysplasia , 1 ( 7 %) had nodular low-grade dysplasia , and 2 ( 14.3 %) had squamous cell carcinoma. Mild anticipated intraprocedural bleeding was present with most procedures. However , no significant postoperative bleeding or perforation was encountered. One patient had mild<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom> postprocedure. En bloc resection was achieved in all lesions<symptom> 100 %. Histological R0 was achieved in 5/12 lesions<symptom> ( 41.6 %). The mean length of the resected area was 24.8 ± 13 mm ( IQR: 17-30 mm). All patients were safely discharged home after overnight observation. In conclusion , this is the largest series of esophageal ESD using the multimodal Clutch Cutter in the United States; we found that the device effectively achieved en bloc resection of superficial esophageal neoplasia without significant adverse events. The use of the Clutch Cutter should be considered as one option to minimize adverse events during ESD in the Western population.
