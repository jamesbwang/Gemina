 There is no evidence of the practices of obstetricians and gynecologists ( OB/GYNs) regarding contraceptive use and determinants influencing contraceptive choices , including emergency methods such as combined oral contraceptives ( COCs) and levonorgestrel intrauterine system ( LNGIUS). This survey determines the practices and knowledge among Chinese female OB/GYNs regarding modern contraceptive methods. A multicenter questionnaire was completed by 2000 female OB/GYNs participating in training courses organized by the gynecological endocrinology training committee of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association from February to May 2013. This survey achieved a response rate of 51.4 %. The rate of induced abortion<disease><symptom> among this group was 56.3 %; this may be attributable to unreliable contraceptive methods ( 55.5 %) and failure of reliable contraceptive methods ( 18.9 %). Intrauterine devices ( IUDs) were more commonly used by parous women than nulliparous women ( 42.6 % vs 1.7 %; p < 0.0001) , followed by condom and rhythm method ( 24.2 % vs 20.8 %). However , nulliparous women commonly used rhythm method ( 48.3 % vs 3.3 %; p < 0.0001) and condoms ( 19.2 % vs 10.5 %; p = 0.008). OB/GYNs demonstrated misconceptions of OB/GYNs about COCs , such as the risk of breast cancer , amenorrhea and premature ovarian failure , and decreased fertility as reported by 37.10 , 10.6 , and 7.5 % of the respondents , respectively. IUDs were commonly used by parous Chinese OB/GYNs. Unreliable contraceptive methods and misconceptions about the side effects of COCs may result in the high rate of unintended pregnancies. Hence , awareness of safe and effective contraceptive methods should be strengthened among OB/GYNs in China.
