 Following the bomb attack on the government quarter on 22 July 2011 , many of the injured were treated at the accident and emergency department in Oslo. The patients ( n = 79) were sent a questionnaire ten months after their treatment and again after three years. A total of 42 patients responded on one or both occasions. Post-traumatic stress reactions were measured using PTSD-RI ( University of California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index). Symptoms<symptom> of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> were measured with the aid of HSCL-8 ( Hopkins Symptom<symptom> Checklist). Physical symptoms<symptom> were surveyed using twelve questions. Satisfaction with follow-up was measured with eight questions on a five-point scale. After ten months , the average score for PTSD-RI was 1.4 ( 95 % CI 1.0-1.7) , and 31 % of the responses were at a clinical PTSD level. After three years , the average score was 1.3 ( 95 % CI 0.9-1.7) , and 25 % were at a clinical PTSD level. Symptom<symptom> score for anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> after ten months was 0.9 ( 95 % CI 0.6-1.2) and after three years 0.8 ( 95 % CI 0.5-1.2). The most frequent physical symptom<symptom> was headache<symptom>. The satisfaction with follow-up varied somewhat but was generally good. Several patients who received treatment for injuries at the accident and emergency department in Oslo had mental symptoms<symptom> for a long period following the terror attack. The patients were satisfied with the follow-up , which was mainly provided by the primary healthcare service.
