 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACE-inhibitors) are widely prescribed for several cardiovascular indications. This study investigated patterns of ACE-inhibitor use for various indications. A descriptive , retrospective population-based study was conducted using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Patients starting ACE-inhibitors ( 2007-2014) were selected and ACE-inhibitor indications were retrieved from electronically recorded medical records. Stratified by indication , we distinguished between persistent and non-persistent ACE-inhibitor use , considering a six-month interval between two prescription periods as a maximum for persistent use. Five-year persistence rates for various indications were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared in a log-rank test. Non-persistent users were subdivided into three groups: 1) stop , 2) restart , and 3) switch to an angiotensin II-receptor blocker ( ARB). Patients who received ACE-inhibitors for hypertension who switched to other classes of antihypertensive medications were further investigated. In total , 254,002 ACE-inhibitor initiators were identified with hypertension ( 57.6 %) , myocardial infarction ( MI) ( 4.2 %) , renal disease<disease> ( RD) ( 3.7 %) , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) ( 1.5 %) , combinations of the above ( 17.2 %) , or none of the above ( 15.8 %). Five-year persistence rates ranged from 43.2 % ( RD) to 68.2 % ( MI) ( p < 0.0001). RD and HF patients used ACE-inhibitors for the shortest time ( average 23.6 and 25.0 months , respectively). For the non-persistent group , the percentage of switchers to ARBs ranged from 27.6 % ( RD) to 42.2 % ( MI) and the restarters ranged from 15.0 % ( HF) to 18.1 % ( group without indication). Depending on the indication , there are various rates of ACE-inhibitor non-persistence. Patients with RD are most likely to discontinue treatment.
