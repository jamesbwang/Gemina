 Postoperative delirium<symptom> ( POD) has a high prevalence among vascular surgery patients , increasing morbidity , mortality , and length of stay. We prospectively studied preoperative risk factors for delirium<symptom> that can be assessed by the surgical team to identify high-risk patients and assessed its impact on hospital costs. There were 173 elective vascular surgery patients assessed preoperatively for cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA) and the Confusion<symptom> Assessment Method for POD , which was verified by chart and clinical review. Demographic information , medications , and a history of substance abuse , psychiatric disorders , and previous delirium<symptom> were prospectively recorded. An accompanying retrospective chart review of an additional 434 ( elective and emergency) vascular surgery patients provided supplemental cost information related to sitter use and prolonged hospitalization secondary to three factors: delirium<symptom> alone , dementia alone , and delirium<symptom> and dementia. Prospective screening of 173 patients ( 73.4 % male; age , 69.9 ± 10.97 years) identified that 119 ( 68.8 %) had MoCA scores < 24 , indicating cognitive impairment , with 7.5 % having severe impairment ( dementia). Patients who underwent amputation had significantly ( P < .000) lower MoCA scores ( 17 of 30) compared with open surgery and endovascular aneurysm<disease> repair patients ( 23.7 of 30). The incidence of delirium<symptom> was 11.6 % in the elective cohort. Regression analysis identified predictors of delirium<symptom> to be type of surgical procedure , including lower limb amputation ( odds ratio ( OR) , 16.67; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 3.41-71.54; P < .000) and open aortic repair ( OR , 5.33; 95 % CI , 1.91-14.89; P < .000); cognitive variables ( dementia: OR , 5.63; 95 % CI , 2.08-15.01; P < .001); MoCA scores ≤ 15 , indicating moderate<symptom> to severe impairment ( OR , 6.13; 95 % CI , 1.56-24.02; P = .02); and previous delirium<symptom> ( OR , 2.98; 95 % CI , 1.11-7.96; P = .03). Retrospective review ( N = 434) identified differences in sitter needs for patients with both delirium<symptom> and dementia ( mean , 13.6 days) , delirium<symptom> alone ( mean , 3.9 days) , or dementia alone ( mean , < 1 day ( 17.7 hours)). Fifteen patients required > 200 hours ( 8.3 days) , accounting for 69.7 % of sitter costs for the surgical unit; 43.7 % of costs were accounted for by patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment. POD is predicted by type of vascular surgery procedure , impaired cognition ( MoCA) , and previous delirium<symptom>. Costs and morbidity related to delirium<symptom> are greatest for those with impaired cognitive burden. Preoperative MoCA screening can identify those at highest risk , allowing procedure modification and informed care.
