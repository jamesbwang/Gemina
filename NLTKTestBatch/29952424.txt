 Evaluation of the results of surgical treatment in patients with hyperparathyroidism related to MEN syndrome<symptom> MATERIALS AND METHODS: The group of three women and two men aged between 17 and 72 years ( av. 38.6) with MEN- related hyperparathyroidism within 419 patients were operated between 2010-2016. MEN1 syndrome<symptom> was diagnosed in four patients and MEN2 only once. Pre- and postoperative results of PTH levels and serum calcium values were compared. The mean preoperative serum PTH level was 215,56 pg/ml , whereas calcium concentration was 1.40 mmol/l. Three Patients with MEN1 syndrome<symptom> had three and two thirds of parathyroid gland taken , and one had a single parathyroid gland excised with biopsy of the rest glands performed. A patient with MEN2 syndrome<symptom> had one parathyroid gland excised. Postoperatively , we reported decreased secretion of both PTH ( a mean serum PTH concentration 6.72 pg/ml) , and serum calcium concentration 1.11 mmol/l. One patient ( 25 %) with MEN 1 developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism after five years from the surgery. The patient was reoperated. The rest of the parathyroid gland was removed with an implantation into separated muscle pockets in the anterior forearm muscles. 1. MEN syndrome<symptom> is a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. 2. Subtotal parathyroidectomy helps to bring back a normal calcium metabolism. 3. Recurrence of hyperparathyroidism in patients with MEN syndrome<symptom> requires total parathyroidectomy with an autotransplantation into the anterior forearm muscles.
