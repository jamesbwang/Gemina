 Extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas ( EP-NEC) are rare tumours that require expertise for correct and timely diagnosis , which is essential for clinical decision making. The number of patients affected , treatment given , and the proportion surviving the disease<disease> is based on limited evidence. The aim of this study is to retrospectively analyse the incidence , treatment , and relative survival ( RS) of EP-NEC patients in the Netherlands. Patients diagnosed between 2008-2012 with EP-NEC or NEC with unknown primary site ( UP-NEC) were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry based on combinations of tumour localisation and morphology code. Incidence was studied using the European standardised ( ESR) and world standardised rates , and RS was calculated using the Ederer II method. In total , 1,544 cases were analysed , 1,045 EP-NEC and 499 UP-NEC. For EP-NEC , the incidence was 1.0 per 100,000 person-years ( ESR) , the mean age was 68 years , and the male to female ratio was 1: 0.6. Most frequent EP-NEC localisations were the bladder and the gastrointestinal tract<symptom> , and the treatment most frequently given was surgery in combination with chemotherapy. The overall 5-year RS was 38 % for patients with local/regional disease<disease> ( n = 447) , and 7 % for patients with extensive disease<disease> ( n = 582). For UP-NEC patients ( n = 499) , the 5-year RS was 6 %. This study is the first nationwide study presenting an increase in the incidence of EP-NEC patients from 196 to 260 cases annually in the Netherlands. The best 5-year RS was found for EP-NEC patients with local disease<disease> located in the bladder , where the worst 5-year RS was found for patients with disease<disease> located in the oesophagus.
