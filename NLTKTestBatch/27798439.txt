 Obstructive bowel disorders ( OBD) are characterized by lumen distention<symptom> due to mechanical or functional obstruction in the gut. Abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> is one of the main symptoms<symptom> in OBD. In this article , we aim to critically review the potential mechanisms for acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in bowel obstruction ( BO). While clustered contractions and associated increase of intraluminal pressure may account for colicky<symptom> pain<symptom> in simple obstruction , ischemia may be involved in acute<symptom> pain<symptom> in severe conditions such as closed loop obstruction. Recent preclinical studies discovered that visceral sensitivity is increased in BO , and visceral hypersensitivity<disease> may underlie the mechanisms of chronic<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> in BO. Mounting evidence suggests that lumen distension , as a circumferential mechanical stretch , alters gene expression ( mechano-transcription) in the distended bowel , and mechano-transcription of nociceptive and inflammatory mediators plays a critical role in the development of visceral hypersensitivity<disease> in BO. Mechano-transcription of nerve growth factor ( NGF) in gut smooth muscle cells is found to increase voltage-gated Na
