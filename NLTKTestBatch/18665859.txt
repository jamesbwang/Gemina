 Prevalence of atopic diseases<disease> is progressively increasing in children with unclear clinical picture in oral cavity. This study aimed to find correlation between the total antioxidant and periodontal status<symptom> in the saliva of periodontally compromised with atopy. The groups consisted of patients of atopic diseases<disease> and gingivitis<disease> ( ADG) , of atopic diseases<disease> without gingivitis<disease> ( AD) , and healthy controls ( HC). The level of gingival inflammation was evaluated using the sulcus bleeding index ( SBI) reported by MÃ¼hlemann and Son. Glutathione ( GSH) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , and superoxide dismutase ( SOD) were estimated in saliva. The mean salivary MDA levels of group HC was significantly lower compared with group ADG and AD ( As there was no significant difference in the level of SOD concentration between groups , we suggest that antioxidant imbalance is primarily explained by atopic disease<disease>. The results showed changes in antioxidant balance<symptom> in children with atopy.
