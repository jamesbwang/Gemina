 The microlayer thin film is visualized in situ in a vapor bubble during pool boiling. Contrary to current understanding , bubbles originate on hydrophilic and silane-coated hydrophobic surfaces without a three-phase contact line , i.e. , the microlayer completely covers the bubble base. The occurrence of such a wetted bubble base is found to be dependent on the liquid-solid interaction. As the bubble grows in time , the film decreases in thickness , eventually forming the contact line and dry region. During this drying out process , curvature at the center of the microlayer shows a cyclical behavior due to competing Marangoni and capillary flows , and is characterized as a `` dryout viscosity ''. After the dry region forms , the mechanism of contact line/microlayer movement of a single bubble on the hydrophilic surface is experimentally determined , and a generalized expression of energy required for its unpinning and<symptom> movement<symptom> is defined.
