 Deep eutectic solvents ( DESs) are , at room temperature , about dozens to hundreds of times more viscous than water , which brings pretty thick residues on solid surfaces , for example , causing drag-out and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> in the transfer process. Unfortunately , until now little work had been done for solving this knotty problem. In this study , the super antiwetting surface , i.e. , super-DES-phobic surface ( defined as DES contact angle > 150 °) is proposed and fabricated successfully by a facile coating technique. Hierarchical silver dendrites on copper foam substrate provide effective dual-roughness surfaces showing stable superDESphobicity. The superDESphobic surface can repel the DESs and their derived solutions even under elevated temperature of about 120 °C and the impact attack of drops. It is also found that the superDESphobic surface can significantly delay the DESs freezing and reduce the adhesion strength of the frozen DESs. Interestingly , the superDESphobic surface can be applied as an effective tool for gauging the density of DES using an ∼ 2 μL droplet in virtue of its super antiwetting property. The super antiwetting surfaces show promise for potential applications in DES self-cleaning and antifreezing.
