 Endothelin-1 ( ET-1) acts on ET ( A) and ET ( B) receptors and has been implicated in hemorrhagic shock<symptom> ( shock<symptom>). We determined effect of shock<symptom> and resuscitation by hypertonic saline ( saline) or centhaquin on ET ( A) and ET ( B) receptor expression. Rats were anesthetized , a pressure catheter was placed in the left femoral artery; blood was withdrawn from the right femoral artery to bring mean arterial pressure ( MAP) to 35 mm Hg for 30 min , resuscitation was performed and 90 min later sacrificed to collect samples for biochemical estimations. Resuscitation with centhaquin decreased blood lactate and increased MAP. Protein levels of ET ( A) or ET ( B) receptor were unaltered in the brain , heart , lung and liver following shock<symptom> or resuscitation. In the abdominal aorta , shock<symptom> produced an increase ( 140 %) in ET ( A) expression which was attenuated by saline and centhaquin; ET ( B) expression was unaltered following shock<symptom> but was increased ( 79 %) by centhaquin. In renal medulla , ET ( A) expression was unaltered following shock<symptom> , but was decreased ( -61 %) by centhaquin; shock<symptom> produced a decrease ( -34 %) in ET ( B) expression which was completely attenuated by centhaquin and not saline. Shock<symptom> induced changes in ET ( A) and ET ( B) receptors in the aorta and renal medulla are reversed by centhaquin and may be contributing to its efficacy.
