 In growing elderly populations , there is a heavy burden of comorbidity and a high rate of geriatric syndromes<symptom> ( GS) including chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. To assess the prevalence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> among individuals aged â‰¥ 65 years in the Southern District of Israel and to evaluate associations between chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and other GS. A telephone interview was conducted on a sample of older adults who live in the community. The interview included the Brief Pain Inventory and a questionnaire on common geriatric problems. Of 419 elderly individuals who agreed to be interviewed 232 ( 55.2 %) suffered from chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Of those who reported chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , 136 participants ( 68.6 %) noted that they had very severe or unbearable pain. There were statistically significant associations between the pain itself and decline in patient 's functional status<symptom> , increased falls , reduced mood , and cognitive decline. The results of this study show that chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is very common in older adults and that it is associated with other GS. There is a need to increase awareness of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in older adults and to emphasize the important role that it plays in their care.
