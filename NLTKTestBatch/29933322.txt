 Although several autoantibodies have been identified for polymyositis/dermatomyositis ( PM/DM) diagnosis , the clinical impact of these antibodies is yet to be elucidated. Patients with PM/DM at Okayama University Hospital from 2012 to 2016 were historically enrolled , and antibody profiles were analyzed using line immunoassay. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed based on serological analysis of anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ( ARS) antibodies , including anti-Jo-1 , PL-7 , PL-12 , EJ , OJ , and SS-A/Ro -52 antibodies. Clinical symptoms<symptom> and relapse proportions were compared among these clusters. Sixty-one patients were enrolled in this study: 28 were diagnosed with PM , and 33 were diagnosed with DM. The following 3 clusters were determined: 1 ( n = 10) , anti-Jo-1 and anti-SS-A/Ro -52 antibodies double positive ( 10/10 , 100 %); 2 ( n = 24) , anti-SS-A/Ro -52 antibody positive ( 20/24 , 83 %) , anti-Jo-1 antibody negative ( 24/24 , 100 %) , and anti-ARS antibodies ( excluding anti-Jo-1 antibody) positive ( 15/24 , 63 %); and 3 ( n = 27) , anti-Jo-1 and anti-SS-A/Ro52 antibodies double negative ( 26/27 , 96 %). The proportion of patients who relapsed was significantly lower in cluster 3 than it was in clusters 1 and 2 ( risk ratio , 0.37; 95 % confidence interval , 0.17-0.83; P = 0.026 and risk ratio , 0.42; 95 % confidence interval , 0.20-0.89; P = 0.019 , respectively). There was no difference in the proportion of relapsed patients between clusters 1 and 2. Our cluster analysis shows that anti-SS-A/Ro52 or any anti-ARS antibodies or both might be relevant to clinical outcomes.
