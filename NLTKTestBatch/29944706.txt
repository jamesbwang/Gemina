 Daily self-weighing ( DSW) and daily activity tracking ( DAT) are useful strategies for preventing weight<symptom> gain among African American breast cancer survivors. However , self-monitoring behaviors vary over time , increasing risk of weight<symptom> gain. This study explored the association of nonadherence to DSW and DAT with corresponding weight<symptom> fluctuations<symptom> among African American breast cancer survivors. Using data from a 6-month randomized controlled trial , we conducted a secondary data analysis among women randomized into a DSW group ( n = 13) and a DSW+DAT group ( n = 11). DSW and DAT were captured from wireless scale and activity tracker data. Nonadherence to DSW was defined as one or more days without a weight<symptom> measurement , and nonadherence to DAT was defined as one or more days without activity tracking. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine weight<symptom> fluctuations<symptom> in relation to nonadherence to DSW and DAT. Data analysis occurred from September 2016-April 2017. Over the 6-month study period , women provided 119.2 ± 46.0 weight<symptom> measurements and 121.9 ± 53.2 days of physical activity tracking. Nonadherence to DSW was associated with weight<symptom> fluctuations<symptom>. For every 1-day increase in nonadherence to DSW , weight<symptom> increased by 0.031 kg ( 95 % CI: 0.012 , 0.050; p < 0.01). Additionally , during periods of DSW and DAT weight<symptom> decreased by 0.028 kg ( 95 % CI: -0.042 , -0.014; p < 0.001) and 0.017 kg ( 95 % CI: -0.030; -0.004) respectively. Our findings suggest that nonadherence to DSW was associated with weight<symptom> gain among breast cancer survivors. Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was enhanced during periods of DSW and DAT.
