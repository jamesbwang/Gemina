 Cordyceps<pathogen> sinensis<pathogen> ( = Ophiocordyceps sinensis<pathogen>) and Ganoderma lucidum are 2 medicinal mushrooms that have been suggested to have the potential to enhance exercise capacity. We used a commercial supplement combining a traditional Chinese medicine and G. lucidum and tested its effects on human physical , aerobic , and anaerobic capacities. Physical education students ( n = 96; 43 women , 53 men; mean ± standard deviation age , 26.3 ± 3.21 years) were randomly divided into 3 groups: low-dose treatment , high-dose treatment , and placebo. Participants received the supplement or the placebo for 28-33 days. Both before and after the intervention , the participants performed a graded maximum oxygen consumption ( Vo2max) test on a treadmill and a Wingate anaerobic cycle test ( on a different day). The following parameters were measured and recorded during the maximal graded treadmill test: heart rate , oxygen consumption , respiratory exchange ratio , and ventilation. The following parameters were calculated from the Wingate anaerobic cycle test: maximal anaerobic power , mean anaerobic power , and fatigue<symptom> index. The supplements did not affect Vo2max or the physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> upon maximal exercise during the graded treadmill test. In a similar way , they had no effect on peak or mean power , or fatigue<symptom> index , as measured by the Wingate anaerobic test. A borderline interaction indicated a somewhat lower heart rate at rest after treatment; however , post hoc analysis did not reveal any further statistically significant differences ( P = 0.047; F = 3.169). The findings indicate that dual supplementation with C. sinensis<pathogen> and G. lucidum had no effect on Vo2max , on physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> at peak exercise load during a graded maximal treadmill test , or on the parameters of anaerobic capacity.
