 Evaluating the auditory function in patients with chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin. This study involved 80 patients with chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> who agreed to receive sofosbuvir and ribavirin. All participants were subjected to baseline otological and audiological assessment just before treatment. The audiological assessment included standard pure tone audiometry , extended high-frequency audiometry , immitancemetry and otoacoustic emissions ( OAEs) ( transient and distortion product). According to baseline hearing threshold measurements , the study population was divided into 2 groups. Group 1 included 42 patients with normal hearing sensitivity ( 250-8000 Hz) , and Group 2 included 38 patients with sensorineural hearing loss. After 24 weeks of therapy , otological and audiological assessments were repeated and compared between the two groups and before and after therapy. Post-treatment hearing threshold evaluation showed no significant difference from pretreatment evaluation at all tested frequencies. There was no statistically significant difference between pre and post-treatment otoacoustic emissions results. Therapy with sofosbuvir and ribavirin in chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> has no noticeable effects on cochlear functions.
