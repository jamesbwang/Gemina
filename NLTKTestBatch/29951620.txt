 The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH) and severity of acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) measured by the revised Atlanta classification ( RAC) and determinant-based classification ( DBC). Secondary objectives were to assess IAH as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in the ICU. This prospective international observational study included patients admitted to the ICU with AP and at least one organ<symptom> failure<symptom>. Information was collected on demographics , severity scores at admission using RAC and DBC , organ<symptom> failure<symptom> , mechanical ventilation , continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT) , surgery and mortality. Maximum intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP) during ICU stay was used for analysis. Some 374 patients were included. The hospital mortality rate was 28 · 9 per cent. IAP was measured in 301 patients ( 80 · 5 per cent) , of whom 274 ( 91 · 0 per cent) had IAH and 103 ( 34 · 2 per cent) acute compartment syndrome<symptom>. A higher IAH grade was more likely in patients with severe AP ( 42 per cent for grade I versus 84 per cent for grade IV) and acute critical pancreatitis<disease> ( 9 versus 25 per cent; P = 0 · 001). Compared with grade I IAH , patients with grade IV had more infected necrosis<symptom> ( 16 versus 28 per cent; P = 0 · 005) , need for surgery ( 27 versus 50 per cent; P = 0 · 006) , mechanical ventilation ( 53 versus 84 per cent; P = 0 · 007) and requirement for CRRT ( 22 versus 66 per cent; P < 0 · 001). IAH predicted shock<symptom> ( area under receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve ( AUC) 0 · 79 , 95 per cent c.i. 0 · 73 to 0 · 84) , respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AUC 0 · 82 , 0 · 77 to 0 · 87) , renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AUC 0 · 93 , 0 · 89 to 0 · 96) and mortality ( AUC 0 · 89 , 0 · 86 to 0 · 93). IAH was associated with severity of AP classified according to both RAC and DBC systems. IAP grade can predict outcome of AP during ICU stay.
