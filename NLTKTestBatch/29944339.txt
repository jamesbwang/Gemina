 There is a paucity of efficacious novel drugs to address high rates of treatment resistance and refractory symptoms<symptom> in schizophrenia. The identification of novel therapeutic indications for approved drugs , drug repurposing , has the potential to expedite clinical trials and reduce the costly risk of failure which currently limits CNS drug discovery efforts. In the present review we discuss the historical role of drug repurposing in schizophrenia drug discovery and review the main classes of repurposing candidates currently in clinical trials for schizophrenia in terms of their therapeutic rationale , mechanisms of action and preliminary results from clinical trials. Subsequently we outline the challenges and limitations which face the clinical repurposing pipeline and how novel technologies might serve to address these.
