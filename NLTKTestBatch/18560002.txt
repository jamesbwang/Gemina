 Depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> could seriously affect the quality of life of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) subjects. Currently , little is known about the efficacy and acceptability of agomelatine versus fluoxetine in treating these symptoms<symptom> in T2DM subjects. Therefore , this study was performed to find out which one was better in treating these symptoms<symptom> in T2DM subjects. T2DM subjects with depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> were randomly assigned to receive either fluoxetine ( 30-40 mg/day) or agomelatine ( 25-50 mg/day). The treatment was continued for 12 weeks. The data of the Hamilton Depression<symptom> Rating Scale ( HDRS) and Hamilton Anxiety<symptom> Rating Scale ( HARS) were collected ( at baseline and also at weeks 4 , 8 and 12) to assess the depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , respectively. The metabolic parameters , including body mass index ( BMI) , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG) and hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) , were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. The treatment-related adverse events during the scheduled treatment period were recorded to compare the acceptability of these two drugs. After 12 weeks of treatment , the average HDRS and HARS scores were significantly decreased in both groups. The average HDRS scores were not significantly different between the two groups , although the agomelatine group had a lower average HDRS score. The response and remission rates were similar between the two groups , and these two drugs had no significant effects on BMI and FPG. However , compared with the fluoxetine group , the agomelatine group had the significantly lower average HARS score ( Both fluoxetine and agomelatine could effectively reduce depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in T2DM subjects , but agomelatine might be more effective and acceptable. Future studies with more subjects are needed to support and validate our conclusion.
