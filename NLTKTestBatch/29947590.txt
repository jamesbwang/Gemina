 Individuals with cerebral palsy ( CP) experience impairments in the control of head<disease> and neck<symptom> movements<symptom> , suggesting dysfunction in brainstem circuitry. To examine if brainstem circuitry is altered in CP we compared reflexes evoked in the sternocleidomastoid ( SCM) muscle by trigeminal nerve stimulation in adults with CP and age/sex-matched controls. Increasing the intensity of trigeminal nerve stimulation produced progressive increases in the long-latency suppression of ongoing SCM EMG in controls. In contrast , participants with CP showed progressively increased facilitation around the same reflex window , suggesting heightened excitability of brainstem pathways. We also examined if there was altered activation of cortico-brainstem pathways in response to pre-natal injury of the brain. Motor-evoked potentials ( MEPs) in the SCM that were conditioned by a prior trigeminal afferent stimulation were more facilitated in CP compared to controls , especially in ipsilateral MEPs that are likely mediated by cortico-reticulospinal pathways. In some participants with CP , but not in controls , a combined trigeminal nerve and cortical stimulation near threshold intensities produced large , long-lasting responses in both the SCM and biceps brachii muscles. We propose that the enhanced excitatory responses evoked from trigeminal and cortical inputs in CP are produced by heightened excitability of brainstem circuits , resulting in the augmented activation of reticulospinal pathways. Enhanced activation of reticulospinal pathways in response to early injury of the corticospinal tract<symptom> may provide a compensated activation of the spinal<disease> cord , or alternatively , contribute to impairments in the precise control of head<disease> and neck functions.
