 Research on the syndemic health threats facing sexual minority men suggests that the elevated risk of HIV<pathogen> among this population co-occurs with other psychosocial health disparities. This study aimed to conduct a population-based examination of clinically assessed syndemic predictors of HIV<pathogen> infection among gay and bisexual , compared with heterosexual , men. The sample comprised adult men in the Stockholm Public Health Cohort. A total of 29,328 ( 91.9 %) self-identified as heterosexual , 535 ( 1.7 %) as gay , and 396 ( 1.2 %) as bisexual. We linked survey responses to national health registry data. Gay men had vastly elevated risk of HIV<pathogen> infection ( > 150 times) compared with heterosexuals. Gay men also had an elevated risk of depression<symptom> , suicidality , and violent assaults compared with heterosexuals. Bisexual men had 16 times higher risk of being HIV-positive than heterosexual men. The number of psychosocial syndemic conditions was significantly associated with HIV<pathogen> infection among gay men ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) = 1.67; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI): 1.18 to 2.36) , but not among bisexual and heterosexual men ( AOR = 0.51; 95 % CI: 0.07 to 3.59; AOR = 1.92; 95 % CI: 0.96 to 3.84). Among gay men , the association between co-occurring syndemic conditions and odds of HIV<pathogen> infection was synergistic ( ie , more than additive). This study confirms emerging evidence of the syndemic health threats affecting sexual minority men , finds stronger evidence for syndemics among gay compared with bisexual men , and suggests the need for HIV-prevention interventions that comprehensively address the co-occurring , and synergistically perpetuating , disparities affecting this population.
