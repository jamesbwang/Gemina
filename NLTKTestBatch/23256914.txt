 The length of time between symptom<symptom> onset and reperfusion therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI) is a key determinant of mortality. Information on this delay is scarce , particularly for developing countries. The objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate the individual components of reperfusion time ( RT) in patients with STEMI treated at a University Hospital in 2012. Medical records were reviewed to determine RT , its main ( patient delay time ( PDT) and system delay time ( SDT)) and secondary components and hospital access variables. Cognitive responses were evaluated using a semi-structured questionnaire. A total of 50 patients with a mean age of 59 years ( SD = 10.5) were included , 64 % of whom were male. The median RT was 430 min , with an interquartile range of 315-750 min. Regarding the composition of RT in the sample , PDT corresponded to 18.9 % and SDT to 81.1 %. Emergency medical services were used in 23.5 % of cases. Patients treated in intermediate care units showed a significant increase in SDT ( p = 0.008). Regarding cognitive variables , PDT was approximately 40 min longer among those who answered `` I did n't think it was serious '' ( p = 0.024). In a Brazilian tertiary public hospital , RT was higher than that recommended by international guidelines , mainly because of long SDT , which was negatively affected by time spent in intermediate care units. Emergency Medical Services underutilization was noted. A patient 's low perception of severity increased PDT.
