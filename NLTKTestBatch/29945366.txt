 As a basic syndrome<symptom> of Chinese medicine , the study of characteristic syndrome<symptom> spectrum of Qi deficiency syndrome<symptom> is of great significance for the standardization of clinical diagnosis and modern material basis research. Suitable operators and algorithms were chosen to dig out the relationship between diseases<disease> , syndromes<symptom> , symptoms<symptom> , detection indicators and etiologist from the literature of Chinese clinical and basic research by literature mining method of frequency statistics , association rules and complex network analysis. Moreover , the information system of Institute of Information on Traditional Chinese Medicine , China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences was taken as the tools of data mining. The objective was to study the characteristic spectrum of Qi deficiency syndrome<symptom> and to explore the characteristics of Qi deficiency syndrome<symptom>. The results showed that the syndrome<symptom> of fatigue<symptom> , dietary were the main factors. The main pathogenesis of coronary heart disease<disease> , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<disease> , diabetes and stroke the disease<disease> were Qi deficiency. The clinical features of Qi deficiency syndrome<symptom> were fatigue<symptom> , shortness of breath and pale tongue. The biological indicators of Qi deficiency related were blood lipids , ECG , blood rheology , inflammatory reaction , NO , ET and NF-ÎºB signalling pathway. The Qi deficiency syndrome<symptom> on the level of syndrome<symptom> spectrum was studied by the method of literature mining , which would provide reliable characteristic guidance data for the research on the substantial basis of Qi deficiency , the research on standard of diagnosis , establishment of syndrome<symptom> model , the study on combination of disease<disease> and syndrome<symptom> and the mechanism of prescriptions.
