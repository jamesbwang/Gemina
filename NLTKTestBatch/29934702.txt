 The aim of the study was to assess the long-term outcome of a Malone antegrade continence enema ( MACE) procedure for fecal incontinence or constipation<symptom> in adults. This retrospective single-center study assessed the long-term outcome and quality of life ( QoL) of patients who underwent a MACE procedure between 2005 and 2014 at the Maastricht University Medical Centre. Success rate was quantified by using Malone 's continence scale. Quality of life was assessed by validated questionnaires covering general quality of life ( SF-36 and Karnofsky scale) , current pain level ( visual analog scale) , fecal incontinence ( Vaizey incontinence survey) , or constipation<symptom> ( Cleveland Clinic Constipation Score). Based on patients ' records , 22 out of 30 patients ( 73 %; 95 % CI 54-87 %) were still using their MACE. Mean follow-up was 43 months ( SD 25.9) since time of surgery. According to the Malone continence scale , the overall success rate was 37 % ( 95 % CI 20.0-53.3). Nine patients developed a postoperative complication. Eighteen out of 22 patients ( 13 with constipation<symptom> and 5 with fecal incontinence) returned the QoL questionnaires ( 82 % response rate). Long-term quality of life of patients with a MACE did not differ from the general Dutch population. In our cohort of patients with fecal incontinence or constipation<symptom> , MACE resulted in a disappointed overall success rate of 37 %. However , it may be indicated in patients who do not prefer more invasive surgical procedures or a definite stoma. The success and morbidity rate should be thoroughly discussed with the patients preoperatively.
