 Several conventions have been established in order to define and characterize Mixed<disease> Phenotype Acute Leukemia<disease> ( MPAL). However , megakaryocytic markers have not been included in the definition of MPAL neither in the European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias ( EGIL) proposal nor in any of the WHO Classification of Tumors issues. We report four pediatric acute leukemia<disease> ( AL) cases ( prevalence: 0.18 %) with megakaryoblasts co-expressing the T-specific antigen CD3 ( cytoplasmic) , together with a very homogeneous antigen profile of immature cells and other lymphoid traits. In one case , the presence of epsilon CD3 mRNA was confirmed as well on sorted CD34 + blasts. All four cases were infants , and two of them disclosed trisomy 21 in the blast population ( not constitutional) without being children with Down Syndrome<symptom>. They were homogeneously treated with AML schemes , achieving all four CR. However , 3 patients relapsed early. Only one patient is alive and remain disease-free , with a long follow-up. Even though cyCD3 was the only T cell marker expressed , its specificity entails the consideration of these cases as a new subtype of MPAL Megakaryoblastic/T , keeping this in mind when designing diagnostic panels. Detection and report of these cases are necessary so as to further characterize them in order to define the most appropriate treatment.
