 An 8-week feeding trial was performed to assess the effects of dietary white button mushroom ( Agaricus bisporus) powder ( WBMP) on the mucosal immunity and growth of rainbow<disease> trout ( Oncorhynchus<pathogen> mykiss). Trout ( n = 192; weight<symptom> 13.76 ± 1.17 g) were stocked in 12 cages ( 65 × 65 × 65 cm) placed in 4 raceways with a flow-through water system. Trout were fed a basal diet ( control group) or a basal diet supplemented with 0.5 % , 1 % , or 2 % WBMP for 8 weeks. Evaluation of total protein levels and lysozyme activity in skin mucus revealed noticeable increases in trout fed 1 % or 2 % WBMP ( P < 0.05) , but no significant difference was observed with 0.5 % WBMP administration ( P > 0.05). The results of sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed alterations in the protein profile of skin mucus following dietary administration of WBMP. Molecular studies showed a noticeable increase ( P < 0.05) in tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α messenger RNA in the intestine of WBMP-fed trout , regardless of the inclusion level. Also , fish receiving the 1 % or 2 % WBMP treatments had a remarkable increase in interleukin ( IL) -1 β expression compared with the control group ( P < 0.05). In a similar way , intestinal IL-8 expression was upregulated with the 1 % and 2 % WBMP treatments ( P < 0.05). However , no significant difference was found between the control group and the 0.5 % WBMP treatment group in the case of IL-8 gene expression ( P > 0.05). Furthermore , after 8 weeks of WBMP feeding , no improvement was seen in the growth parameters of trout compared with those fish fed the nonsupplemented diet ( P > 0.05). These results hint at the potential immunomodulatory effects of dietary WBMP.
