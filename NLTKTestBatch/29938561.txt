 Follow-up studies of weight<symptom> gain related to antipsychotic treatment beyond a year are limited in number. We compared weight<symptom> change in the three most commonly prescribed antipsychotics in a representative UK General Practice database. We conducted a cohort study in United Kingdom primary care records of people newly prescribed olanzapine , quetiapine or risperidone. The primary outcome was weight<symptom> in each six month period for two years after treatment initiation. Weight<symptom> changes were compared using linear regression , adjusted for age , baseline weight<symptom> and diagnosis. N = 6338 people received olanzapine , 12,984 quetiapine and 6556 risperidone. Baseline weight<symptom> was lowest for men treated with olanzapine ( 80.8 kg versus 83.5 kg quetiapine , 82.0 kg risperidone) and women treated with olanzapine ( 67.7 kg versus 71.5 kg quetiapine 68.4 kg risperidone. Weight<symptom> gain occurred during treatment with all three drugs. Compared with risperidone mean weight<symptom> gain was higher with olanzapine ( adjusted co-efficient +1.24 kg ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.69-1.79 kg per six months) for men and +0.77 kg ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.29-1.24 kg) for women). Weight<symptom> gain with quetiapine was lower in unadjusted models compared with risperidone , but this difference was not significant after adjustment. Olanzapine is more commonly prescribed to people with lower weight<symptom>. However , after accounting for baseline weight<symptom> , age , sex and diagnosis , olanzapine is still associated with greater weight<symptom> gain over two years than risperidone or quetiapine. Baseline weight<symptom> does not ameliorate the risks of weight<symptom> gain associated with antipsychotic medication. Weight<symptom> gain should be assertively discussed and managed for people prescribed antipsychotics , especially olanzapine.
