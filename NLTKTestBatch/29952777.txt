 We present 2 unique cases of exertional supraspinatus syndrome<symptom> related to overexertion in 2 young men. In both cases , the diagnosis was delayed because the symptom<symptom> was nonspecific shoulder pain; however , progressive<symptom> pain<symptom> , an elevated creatine kinase ( CK) level , and either increased compartmental pressures<symptom> or findings on magnetic resonance imaging eventually led to the appropriate diagnosis. The terms `` supraspinatus compartment syndrome<symptom> '' and `` supraspinatus rhabdomyolysis '' are inappropriately used interchangeably. We believe that both conditions are part of a spectrum of pathology called exertional supraspinatus syndrome<symptom>. It is important to differentiate between these conditions because a patient with supraspinatus compartment syndrome<symptom> , which is distinguished by elevated compartment pressures<symptom> , requires an immediate fasciotomy.
