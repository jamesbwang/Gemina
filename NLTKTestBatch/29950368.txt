 Steroid-induced ocular hypertension ( SIOH) is a challenging entity in paediatric age , with many being refractory to medical therapy. Literature is scarce about surgical options in these cases. A 14-year-old girl with bilateral uveitis and macular oedema had received an intravitreal and subconjunctival triamcinolone injection in the right<symptom> ( OD) and left ( OS) eye , respectively. While the steroid was effective in resolving the oedema , intraocular pressure ( IOP) increased to about 40 mm Hg OD and 34 mm Hg OS , despite being under maximal IOP-lowering therapy. An initial conservative approach was preferred due to the young patient age and given that most cases of SIOH are transient. However , progressive structural changes were documented , and bilateral sequential minimally invasive glaucoma surgery ( MIGS: XEN gel stent) was taken. With a follow-up of 6 months , the patient is drug-free with IOP around 14 mm Hg. This report discusses the role and efficacy of MIGS in a paediatric case of SIOH.
