 To evaluate the extent to which the population of Polish preadolescents is vitamin D deficient and to assess seasonal variations in vitamin D status<symptom>. A total of 720 healthy children aged 9-13 years ( 409 girls , 311 boys) residing in 6 representative geographical locations in Poland were studied. A parental-assisted questionnaire provided data on nutritional habits , vitamin D supplements and sun exposure. Serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin was determined twice , after the winter in March and after the summer in October. In March , vitamin D deficiency ( 25-50 nmol/L) was found in 64 % , and severe deficiency ( < 25 nmol/L) in 20.2 % of children. In October , the deficiency and severe deficiency were still noticed in 25.9 and 0.1 % of children , respectively. The mean serum concentration of 25-OHD was 52 % higher in October ( 55.4 ± 14.0 nmol/L) than in March ( 36.4 ± 13.5 nmol/L) , ( p < 0.01). In children with 25-OHD < 50 nmol/L in March , their 25-OHD concentration increased by 64 % through March to October ( 32.5 ± 8.2 vs. 53.2 ± 7.9 nmol/L , p < 0.01). An association was found between 25-OHD concentration and regular consumption of vitamin D supplements , cod-liver oil and fish. The majority of preadolescent Polish boys and girls show vitamin D deficiency after the winter period , although a distinct amelioration over summertime is found in this age group. There is a need to implement effective prevention and intervention strategies in the management of vitamin D deficiency among schoolchildren in Poland , with the supplementation throughout the entire year.
