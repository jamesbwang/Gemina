 Formulation of a global Unified Dosimetry Index ( gUDI) for the evaluation of prostate simultaneous integrated boost Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy ( VMAT by RapidArc) radiotherapy plans. Dose coverage , conformity , homogeneity and dose gradient index could be included in the Unified Dosimetry Index ( UDI). We developed a global UDI to evaluate treatment plans containing volumes irradiated with different dose prescriptions: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy with simultaneous integrated boost ( IMRT-SIB) with 2 dose levels ( 36.25 Gy/5 fz for the whole prostate gland and 37.5 Gy/5 fz for Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion<symptom> ( DIL)). To validate gUDI scoring system , 65 prostate cancer patients were evaluated. Mean ( µ) and standard deviations ( σ) were calculated for all dosimetry indices and gUDI. Furthermore , gUDI µ and σ were analyzed to compare and classify treatment plans: plans can be ranked as `` excellent '' , `` good '' , `` average '' or `` poor ''. Prostate Dose Gradient , Prostate Conformity and DIL Conformity indices had highlighted a major deviation from ideal scores. gUDI index classification showed most of the plans scored as `` average '' and `` good ''. gUDI score can be a useful tool to quantify treatment plans quality also when volumes with different dose-prescription are treated.
