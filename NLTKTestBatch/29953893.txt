 Combined delivery of a therapeutic small interfering RNA ( siRNA) and a chemotherapeutic agent to cancer cells is promising as anticancer therapy , which could offer enhanced cell killing potential and low side effect. However , simultaneous delivery to tumor is challenging. In our study , cholesterol-modified low molecular weight<symptom> chitosan ( MW ~ 15 kDa) was employed as a self-assembled delivery system for both siRNA and a hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agent , curcumin to cancer cells. The siRNA/curcumin loaded nanoparticles ( C-CCM/siRNA) were physico-chemically characterized for particle size ( 165 ± 2.6 nm) and zeta potential ( +24.8 ± 2.2 mV). The ability of CCM to condense siRNA was determined by ethidium bromide exclusion and gel retardation assay using electrophoresis. The result demonstrated that the condensation of C-CCM with siRNA was optimum at minimum N/P ratio of 40. C-CCM/siRNA was stable at 4 °C for a period of > 1 month. C-CCM/siRNA was taken up efficiently by human lung carcinoma cells , A549 in a time-dependent manner. The cellular internalization of C-CCM/siRNA was observed via clathrin-mediated endocytosis as determined by using specific endocytosis inhibitors. The study demonstrated the feasibility of the use of cholesterol conjugated chitosan as a co-delivery system for both siRNA and a hydrophobic drug for combination cancer therapy.
