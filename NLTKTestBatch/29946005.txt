 We assessed safety and tolerability of treatment with pirfenidone ( 1602-2403 mg/day) and nintedanib ( 200-300 mg/day) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF). This 24-week , single-arm , open-label Phase IV study ( NCT02598193) enrolled patients with IPF with forced vital capacity ( FVC) ≥ 50 % and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity ( DLco) ≥ 30 %. Before initiating nintedanib , patients had received pirfenidone for ≥ 16 weeks and tolerated a stable dose of ≥ 1602 mg/day for ≥ 28 days. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients who completed 24 weeks of combination treatment on pirfenidone ( 1602-2403 mg/day) and nintedanib ( 200-300 mg/day). Investigators recorded treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) , attributing them to pirfenidone , nintedanib , both or neither.Eighty-nine patients were enrolled; 73 completed 24 weeks of treatment ( 69 meeting the primary endpoint) and 16 discontinued treatment prematurely ( 13 due to TEAEs). Seventy-four patients had 418 treatment-related TEAEs , of which diarrhoea<disease> , nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> were the most common. Two patients had serious treatment-related TEAEs.Combined pirfenidone and nintedanib use for 24 weeks was tolerated by the majority of patients with IPF and associated with a similar pattern of TEAEs expected for either treatment alone. These results encourage further study of combination treatment with pirfenidone and nintedanib in patients with IPF.
