 Elderly individuals who are hospitalized due to emergency abdominal surgery spend over 80 % of their recovery time in bed , resulting in early and rapid muscle<symptom> loss<symptom>. As these elderly individuals have a lower physiological reserve , the impact of muscle wasting on function may be profound. The objectives of this study are to ( 1) create an independently led post-surgical reconditioning program and ( 2) pilot its implementation , while assessing the feasibility and safety of the program. The BE FIT program was generated with hospital rehabilitation staff to target lower limb strength , balance<symptom> , and endurance. This pilot study was assessed using a sequential before and after trial , with a cohort of patients aged â‰¥ 65 years enrolled in the Elder-friendly Approaches to the Surgical Environment ( EASE) study. Change in 30-s sit-to-stand performance between postoperative day 2 and discharge was compared between Usual Care pre- and post-BE FIT participants. A total of 66 patients participated in the sub-study , 33 Usual Care and 33 BE FIT. Mean ( SD) age was 76.2 ( 8.78); 44 ( 67 %) were female , with 11 ( 17 %) reporting mild/moderate frailty on the CHSA Clinical Frailty Scale. BE FIT participants had a median of three rehab days and self-reported completing an average of 83 % of the exercises. The adjusted between group difference showed that the BE FIT patients were able to complete more stands than the Usual Care ( 1.9 stands ( 0.94) , The reconditioning program was shown to be safe and feasible within the hospital setting for the elderly emergency abdominal surgery patients. More rigorous assessment is needed to confirm this effectiveness and to better assess patient adherence to self-directed exercise. Registration #NCT02233153 through ClinicalTrials.gov.
