 We conducted a cross-sectional study to compare the horizontal and vertical methods used in the surgical closure of the neo-pharynx after total laryngectomy in terms of their effect on swallowing function , swallowing-related quality of life ( QOL) , and overall QOL. We also assessed the potential influence of age ( ≤ 64 vs. ≥ 65 yr) and the type of treatment modality ( primary , salvage , or total laryngectomy with radiotherapy) on outcomes. Our final study population was made up of 34 patients-31 men and 3 women , aged 49 to 89 years ( mean: 66.8)- who had undergone a total laryngectomy. One year after surgery , all patients were asked to complete the M.D. Anderson dysphagia<symptom> inventory ( MDADI) , which quantifies swallowing function and swallowing-related QOL , and the University of Washington quality-of-life questionnaire ( UW-QOL) , which quantifies overall QOL. Of the 34 patients , 16 had undergone a horizontal surgical closure of their neo-pharynx and 18 a vertical closure. According to the MDADI , patients in the horizontal group experienced significantly better swallowing function/QOL; the mean composite MDADI scores were 91.5 in the horizontal group and 68.3 in the vertical group ( p = 0.005). We found no significant difference in terms of overall QOL , as the respective mean UW-QOL scores were 81.0 and 80.8 ( p = 0.93). The population correlation coefficient was positive in both groups , but more so in the horizontal group ( ρ
