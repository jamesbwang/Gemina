 Current level of asthma control can be easily assessed by validated instruments , but it is currently difficult to assess individuals ' level of future risk. Develop , and validate , a risk prediction score for level of future risk , including patient characteristics and information on early treatment response. We used data of 304 adult patients with asthma from a 12-month primary care randomized controlled trial with 3-monthly assessments. With logistic regression we modeled the association between the level of future risk and patient characteristics including early treatment response. Future risk was defined as Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ) score of 1.5 or more at 12 months or the experience of at least 1 exacerbation during the final 6 months. We developed a risk prediction score on the basis of regression coefficients. Performance of the risk prediction score improved , taking into account data on early treatment response ( area under receiver-operating curve ( AUROC) = 0.84) compared with a model containing only baseline characteristics ( AUROC = 0.78). The score includes 6 easy-to-obtain predictors: sex , ACQ score and exacerbations in the previous year at baseline and at first follow-up , and smoking status<symptom> and exacerbations in the previous 3 months ( indicating early treatment response). External validation yielded an AUROC of 0.77. The risk prediction score classified patients into 3 risk groups: low ( absolute risk , 11.7 %) , intermediate ( 47.0 %) , and high ( 72.7 %). We developed and externally validated a risk prediction score , quantifying both level of current asthma control and the guideline-defined future risk. Patients ' individual risk can now be estimated in an easy way , as proposed but not specified , by asthma management guidelines.
