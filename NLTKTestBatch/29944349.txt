 Group 10 metal catalysts have shown much promise for the copolymerization of non-polar with polar alkenes to directly generate functional materials , but access to high copolymer molecular weights nevertheless remains a key challenge toward practical applications in this field. In the context of identifying new strategies for molecular weight<symptom> control , we report a series of highly polarized P ( V)- P ( III) chelating ligands that manifest unique space filling and electrostatic effects within the coordination<symptom> sphere of single component Pd polymerization catalysts and exert important influences on ( co) polymer molecular weights. Single component , cationic phosphonic diamide-phosphine ( PDAP) Pd catalysts are competent to generate linear , functional polyethylenes with Mw up to ca. 2 Ã— 105 g mol-1 , significantly higher than prototypical catalysts in this field , and with polar content up to ca. 9 mol %. Functional groups are positioned by these catalysts almost exclusively along the main chain , not at chain ends or ends of branches , which mimics the microstructures of commercial linear low-density polyethylenes. Spectroscopic , X-ray crystallographic , and computational data indicate PDAP coordination<symptom> to Pd manifests cationic yet electron-rich active species , which may correlate to their complimentary catalytic properties versus privileged catalysts such as electrophilic- diimine ( Broohart-type) or neutral phosphine-sulfonato ( Drent type) complexes. While steric blocking within the catalyst coordination<symptom> sphere has long been a reliable strategy for catalyst molecular weight<symptom> control , data from this study suggest electronic control should be considered as a complimentary concept less prone to suppression of comonomer enchainment that can occur with highly sterically congested catalysts.
