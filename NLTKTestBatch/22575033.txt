 Congenital auditory neuropathy ( AN) affects hearing and<symptom> speech<symptom> development. The degree of hearing difficulty in congenital AN varies as a function of pathology at the inner ear hair cell ( IHC) synapses or the auditory nerve. We report a case of a Chinese girl with AN revealed by OTOF ( otoferlin) gene mutation analysis who had only a mild hearing loss. A 13-year-old Chinese girl was diagnosed as having congenital AN on the basis of OTOF gene mutation analysis. She manifest a mild sensorineural hearing loss with 50 % maximum monosyllable speech discrimination rate , normal DPOAEs ( distortion product otoacoustic emissions) beyond ambient noise levels , only SPs ( summating potentials) evoked during ECoG ( electrocochleography) and absent ABRs ( auditory evoked brainstem responses) bilaterally to clicks presented at 100 dBnHL. She was able to effectively communicate with others by speech reading owing to her mild hearing loss. Moreover , bilateral hearing aids helped her to communicate. Our patient was demonstrated to have a mutation on the OTOF gene. Nevertheless , she was able to communicate using auditory visual speech reading in spite of a mild auditory threshold elevation probably due to partial pathology at the IHC synapses or in the auditory nerve.
