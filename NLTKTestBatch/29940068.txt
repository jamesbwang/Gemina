 Maintenance of the complex phenotype of primary hepatocytes in vitro represents a limitation for developing liver support systems and reliable tools for biomedical research and drug screening. We herein aimed at developing a biosystem able to preserve human and rodent hepatocytes phenotype in vitro based on the main characteristics of the liver sinusoid: unique cellular architecture , endothelial biodynamic stimulation , and parenchymal zonation. Primary hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ( LSEC) were isolated from control and cirrhotic human or control rat livers and cultured in conventional in vitro platforms or within our liver-resembling device. Hepatocytes phenotype , function , and<symptom> response<symptom> to hepatotoxic drugs were analyzed. Results evidenced that mimicking the in vivo sinusoidal environment within our biosystem , primary human and rat hepatocytes cocultured with functional LSEC maintained morphology and showed high albumin and urea production , enhanced cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 4 ( CYP3A4) activity , and maintained expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha ( hnf4Î±) and transporters , showing delayed hepatocyte dedifferentiation. In addition , differentiated hepatocytes cultured within this liver-resembling device responded to acute treatment with known hepatotoxic drugs significantly different from those seen in conventional culture platforms. In conclusion , this study describes a new bioengineered device that mimics the human sinusoid in vitro , representing a novel method to study liver diseases<disease> and toxicology.
