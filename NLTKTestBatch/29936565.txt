 T-cell exhaustion<symptom> reportedly leads to dysfunctional immune responses of antigen-specific T cells. Investigations have revealed that T cells expand into functionally defective phenotypes with poor recall/memory abilities to parasitic antigens. The exploitation of co-inhibitory pathways represent a highly viable area of translational research that has very well been utilized against certain cancerous conditions. Malaria<disease> , at times , evolve into a sustained chronic state where T cells express several co-inhibitory molecules ( negative immune checkpoints) facilitating parasite escape and sub-optimal protective responses. Experimental evidence suggests that blockade of co-inhibitory molecules on T cells in malaria<disease> could result in the sustenance of protective responses together with dramatic parasite clearance. The role of several co-inhibitory molecules in malaria<disease> infection largely remain unclear , and here we discussed the potential applicability of co-inhibitory molecules in the management of malaria<disease> with a view to harness protective host responses against chronic<disease> disease<disease> and associated consequences.
