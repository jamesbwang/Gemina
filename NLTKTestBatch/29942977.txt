 Re-worsening left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) is observed in some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM) despite initial improvements in LVEF. We analyzed cardiac outcomes and clinical variables associated with this re-worsening LVEF. A total of 180 newly diagnosed DCM patients who received only pharmacotherapy were enrolled. Echocardiography was performed after 6 , 12 , 24 , and 36 months after initiation of pharmacotherapy. Patients were divided into three groups: ( 1) Improved: ( n = 113 , 63 %) , defined as those > 10 % increase in LVEF after 12 months and no decrease ( > 10 %) between 12 and 36 months; ( 2) Re-worse: ( n = 12 , 7 %) , those with > 10 % increase in LVEF after 12 months but with decrease ( > 10 %) between 12 and 36 months; and ( 3) Not-improved: ( n = 55: 30 %) , those with no increase in LVEF ( > 10 %) after 12 months. Patients with re-worse group were older ( P = 0.04) and had higher brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP) levels after 12 months ( P = 0.002) than those in the Improved group. Major cardiac events ( sudden death , implantation of a ventricular assist device , and death due to heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ,) were observed in 13 ( 7 %) patients after 36 months of pharmacotherapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that the Re-worse group had a higher risk for cardiac events ( hazard ratio 11.7 , 95 % confidence interval 1.9-90.7 , P = 0.01) than the Improved group , but had a similar risk compared with the Not-improved group. Re-worsening LVEF was associated with poor cardiac outcomes in newly diagnosed DCM patients. Age and persistently high-BNP levels after improvement in LVEF were significantly associated with re-worsening LVEF.
