 Exogenous stressors resulting from air pollution can lead to depression<symptom> and chronic<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease>. Chinese levels of air pollution are among the highest in the world , and although associated adverse health effects are gradually emerging , research determining individual vulnerability is limited. This study estimated the association between air pollution and depressive symptoms<symptom> and identified whether chronic<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> influences an individual 's susceptibility to depressive symptoms<symptom> relating to air pollution. Individual sample data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study and a group of city-level variables in 2011 and 2013 were used with the random effects model and Tobit model. Adjustments were made for demographic , socioeconomic status<symptom> , health behavior , and city-level climate variables with respect to living areas. Analysis was also stratified using chronic<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> characteristics. The total Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression<symptom> scale evaluating depressive symptoms<symptom> ranged between 7 and 28 ( average 11.623 ( SD = 4.664)). An 1 % increase in sulfur dioxide and total suspended particulate emission intensities was associated with depressive symptoms<symptom> scores that were 1.266 ( SE = 0.107 , P < 0.001 , 95 % CI 1.057-1.475) and 1.318 ( SE = 0.082 , P < 0.001 , 95 % CI 1.157-1.480) higher , respectively. Compared to respondents without chronic<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> , those with chronic<disease> diseases<disease>diseases<disease> such as hypertension , dyslipidemia , diabetes or high blood sugar , cardiovascular diseases<disease> , cancer or malignant tumor , liver disease<disease> , chronic lung diseases<disease> , kidney disease<disease> , stomach or other digestive disease<disease> , arthritis<disease> or rheumatism , and asthma had scores that were higher for depressive symptoms<symptom>. Results confirm that the adverse health effects of air pollution should be considered when developing air pollution policies. Findings also provide justification for mental health interventions targeting air pollution exposure , especially for people with chronic<disease> diseases<disease>diseases<disease>.
