 There is no consensus on the use of cytomegalovirus<pathogen> ( CMV)- specific hyperimmunoglobulins ( CSHIGs) for suspected congenital CMV infections during pregnancy , but this therapy is currently used in some countries. The objectives of this study were to describe tolerability and pregnancy outcome following treatment with monthly intravenous CSHIG and compare rates of positive PCR and postnatal symptoms<symptom> according to whether CSHIGs were given or not. This retrospective cohort study included all pregnant women who were diagnosed with primary CMV infection or congenital CMV infection at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine ( Montreal , QC) between 2005 and 2016. CSHIG was discussed with pregnant women who received positive CMV PCR results from amniotic fluid or if ultrasound anomalies suggested congenital infection and there was serologic evidence of maternal primary infection ( therapeutic group). CSHIG was also offered as prophylaxis in pregnant women without fetal ultrasound anomalies but with evidence of maternal primary infection , when amniocentesis either had negative results or was not performed ( prophylactic group). A matched analysis was performed to control for timing of maternal infection , amniocentesis , and type and timing of ultrasound anomaly. Sixteen women received CSHIG , and 55 had no CMV-specific treatment. CSHIG treatment was well tolerated. In bivariate analyses , the risk of congenital CMV infection and postnatal symptoms<symptom> did not significantly decrease with CSHIG treatment , in both the therapeutic and the prophylactic groups. After matching , there was still no difference in outcomes between CSHIG-treated and untreated women. The effectiveness of CSHIG in preventing congenital CMV infection and its clinical manifestations could not be demonstrated.
