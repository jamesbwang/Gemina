 The peritoneum protects the intraabdominal organs. This function is exploited by aggressive cancers originating from organs within the abdomen , resulting in peritoneal metastasis. We discuss genomic variants that may lead to peritoneal metastasis from multiple cancers. Peritoneal malignancies are attributed to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These metastatic lesions<symptom> harbor similar genetic mutations to the primary tumor yet may manifest clone-specific aberrations that promote propagation. Peritoneal metastasis are increasingly being treated with surgical resection as an adjunct to radiation , chemotherapy , and other biologic therapies. We describe genetic and genomic variances that are predictive markers for metastasis and burgeoning indicators for peritoneal malignancies.
