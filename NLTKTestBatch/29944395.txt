 In an effort to produce more stable vaccines for infectious laryngotracheitis virus<pathogen> ( ILTV) , recombinant strains with deletion of genes associated with virulence have been evaluated for attenuation and protection efficacy. Among viral genes associated with virulence , a cluster of five open reading frames ( ORFs; A through E) have been identified. An attenuated ILTV recombinant strain with deletion of the ORF<pathogen> C gene induced protection comparable to that elicited by the tissue culture origin ( TCO) vaccine when administered via eyedrop. The objective of this study was to evaluate the attenuation and protection efficacy of the ΔORF C strain when delivered in ovo to maternal antibody negative ( MAb-) and maternal antibody positive ( MAb +) embryos. In ovo delivery of the ΔORF C strain did not affected hatchability or body<symptom> weight<symptom> gain , while virus<pathogen> transmission to contact chickens was minor. Nevertheless , nine of ninety ( 10 %) of MAb- chickens vaccinated with the ΔORF C strain showed marked dyspnea<symptom> , and upon postmortem examination bloody mucoid plugs and high viral genome load were detected in their tracheas. Moreover , the ΔORF C strain induced satisfactory protection in MAb- chickens , but marginal protection in MAb + chickens after challenge. The reduced protection observed for MAb + groups of chickens was likely caused by the interference of maternally derived antibodies. This report presents the use of a genetically attenuated ILTV strain delivered in ovo as a potential new approach in the control of ILTV.
