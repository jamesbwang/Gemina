 Development assistance for health ( DAH) remains a significant and important source of health financing in many low and lower middle-income countries. However , this assistance has not been fully effective. This study explores the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations<symptom> on volatility of DAH in Zambia using a mixed methods approach. Data covering the period 1997-2008 were collected from various financial and programmatic reports , while six key informant interviews were conducted to validate and translate findings from the quantitative analysis. Results show fluctuations<symptom> in the volume of funds disbursed to the Ministry of Health by donors due to changes in the exchange rates between non-US $ currencies and the US$ , ranging from -11.1 % to +13.4 % during the period 1997-2008. The overall effect was a loss of US$ 13.4 million over the period 1997-2008 which is equivalent to an annual average loss of US$ 1.1 million per annum. There were also fluctuations<symptom> in the US$ amount that was converted to the Zambian Kwacha to fund districts ranging from -22 % to +22 % over the same period. The monthly average loss that was incurred was US$ 302 214 per month , but large gains and losses<symptom> were observed when individual months were analysed. Information from key informants suggest that currency exchange rate losses<symptom> contribute to reductions in the health workforce , quantity and quality of health services , while currency exchange rate gains can contribute to reduced absorption capacity and/or low utilization of financial resources. The study concludes that fluctuations<symptom> in currency exchange rates contribute to volatility in DAH , reduces financial stability and leads to unpredictability of DAH which ultimately affects health service delivery. For DAH to be effective , governments and donors should increase awareness and work systematically to mitigate currency exchange risks.
