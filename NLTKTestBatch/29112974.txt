 Treatment duration , treatment interval , formulation and type of antimicrobial ( antibiotic) are modifiable factors that will influence antimicrobial selection pressure. Currently , the impact of the route of administration on the occurrence of resistance in humans is unclear. In this retrospective multi-center cohort study , we assessed the impact of different variables on antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) in pathogens isolated from the urinary<disease> tract<symptom> in older adults. A generalized estimating equations ( GEE) model was constructed using 7397 Resistance in Our model describing shows a dose-response relation between antibiotic use and AMR in Retrospectively registered.
