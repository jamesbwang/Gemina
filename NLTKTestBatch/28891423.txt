 Cancer immunotherapy has greatly advanced in recent years , and PD-1/ PD-L1 blocking therapy has become a major pillar of immunotherapy. Successful clinical trials of PD-1/ PD-L1 blocking therapies in cancer treatments have benefited many patients , which promoted the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approval of PD-1/ PD-L1 blocking drugs. In this review , we provide a detailed introduction of five PD-1/ PD-L1 blocking drugs , with indications and studies , as a valuable reference for doctors and medical investigators. Moreover , the characteristics of PD-1/ PD-L1 blocking therapies , including their universality and sustainability , are discussed in this review. Furthermore , we also discuss and predict the possibility of PD-L1 as an indication marker of PD-1/ PD-L1 blocking therapy for pan-cancer treatment , and the current status<symptom> of combination therapies.
