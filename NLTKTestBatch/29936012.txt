 To investigate whether the relationship between heart rate and neurological outcome is independent of therapeutic hypothermia<symptom> ( TH) and whether heart rate is related to hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> post-cardiac arrest. Retrospective review of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry was performed. The primary exposure was heart rate quartiles at 24 h post-cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was a poor<symptom> neurological outcome , which was defined as having a cerebral performance category ( CPC) of 3-5 at 28 days. Secondary outcomes were mean blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and serum lactate at 24 h and Sequential Organ<symptom> Failure Assessment ( SOFA) scores at admission. In total , 155 patients were enrolled. The proportion of patients with a poor CPC was significantly greater in higher heart rate quartiles; similar results were observed in patients who did and did not undergo TH. Serum lactate levels at 24 h were significantly higher in the 3rd and 4th quartile groups than in the 1st quartile group. Additionally , SOFA scores were significantly higher in the 4th quartile group than in the 1st and 3rd quartile groups. Relative tachycardia<symptom> is associated with poor<symptom> neurological outcomes in post-cardiac arrest patients , independent of TH , and with higher serum lactate levels and admission SOFA scores.
