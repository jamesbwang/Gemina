 Hernia repair is one of the most frequently performed operations. In search of the ideal mesh for hernia repair , animal research is required. Although rats are most often used in experimental mesh experiments , no correlation with clinical findings in humans has ever been shown. Therefore , the aim of our study was to investigate whether adhesion formation and foreign body reactions to meshes in rats are comparable with the reactions in humans. A fixed type of mesh was implanted intraperitoneally in a group of 10 rats and 10 patients undergoing elective , temporary stoma formation. In case of the latter , meshes were placed around the stoma. After a follow-up period of 12 wk in rats and after a median follow-up of 6 mo in humans , samples of the mesh were collected. Adhesion assessments were performed , and ( immuno-) histochemical evaluation was performed by a specialized experimental pathologist and an experienced clinical pathologist. After the follow-up period , adhesion formation did not differ significantly between rats and humans. Moreover , general inflammation<symptom> scores were comparable , although granulocytes and giant cells were more present in rats , compared with humans. On the other hand , the presence of fibrosis<disease> was more evident in humans compared with rats. To our knowledge , this is the first study , which showed that a specific animal model , namely a rat model , correlates with adhesion formation and the foreign body reaction to meshes in humans. It can be recommended to use rats in future experimental mesh for incisional hernia research.
