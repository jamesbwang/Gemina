 We aimed to identify the adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) and antithrombotics on the upper gastrointestinal ( GI) mucosa<pathogen> in a clinical setting as a case-control study using a large-scale medical database in Japan. We evaluated the risk of upper GI mucosal injuries in patients receiving NSAIDs and antithrombotics using the Japan Medical Data Center claims database with data for 13 million accumulated patients , from January 2009 to December 2014. Endoscopically evaluated upper GI mucosal injuries were peptic ulcers<disease> ( n = 143,271) , upper GI bleeding<symptom> ( n = 10,545) , and gastroesophageal reflux disease<disease> ( n = 154,755). For each patient , ten controls were matched by age , sex , and diagnosis month. The odds ratio ( OR) for peptic ulcers<disease> was 1.45 , 1.31 , 1.50 , 1.53 , and 1.62; for upper GI bleeding<symptom>: 1.76 , 1.62 , 1.96 , 1.82 , and 2.38; and for gastroesophageal reflux disease<disease>: 1.54 , 1.41 , 1.89 , 1.67 , and 1.91 for NSAIDs , COX-2 selective inhibitors , low-dose aspirin , antiplatelet drugs , and anticoagulants , respectively ( all statistically significant: P < 0.001). Polypharmacy with NSAIDs and antithrombotic drugs increased the risk of upper GI injuries compared with single-drug therapy. The injury risk was also increased by lifestyle-related diseases<disease> , including diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. This case-control study using the large organized Japanese claims database provided the risk of upper GI mucosal injuries in patients receiving NSAIDs and antithrombotic drugs.
