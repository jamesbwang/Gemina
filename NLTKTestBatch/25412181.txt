 Tembusu<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( TMUV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus<pathogen>. Outbreak of this virus<pathogen> infection in duck flocks was first observed in China in April 2010 , causing severe egg drop and neurological signs in laying ducks. Recently reported duck infections in southeastern Asia highlighted the need for well-validated diagnostic methods of TMUV surveillance to understand its epidemiological characteristics and maintenance in nature. Several enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs) for the detection of TMUV infection have been reported , but none have been applied to high-throughput diagnostics. In this study , a monoclonal antibody ( MAb) against TMUV was generated and characterized. MAb 9E4 was shown to bind specifically to a disulfide bond-dependent epitope on the domain I/II of TMUV E protein , and a blocking ELISA was established based on this MAb. The cut-off percentage inhibition value for negative sera was set at 30 %. By comparison with the virus<pathogen> neutralization test , the specificity and sensitivity of the blocking ELISA were 96.37 % and 100 % , respectively , and the kappa value was 0.966 , based on 416 serum samples collected from both experimentally and clinically infected ducks , geese and chickens. A good correlation ( r Our MAb-based blocking ELISA provides a reliable and rapid diagnostic tool for serological monitoring of TMUV infection and evaluation of immune status<symptom> following TMUV vaccination in multiple poultry species.
