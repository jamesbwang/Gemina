 Dedicated control of axial light emission from light-guides enables a new generation of functional light sources for volumetric illumination. A primary challenge is to ensure homogeneous emission intensity across the full length of the device. Here , we introduce an approach towards homogeneously side-emitting waveguides which do not rely on imposing local scattering centers such as bubbles , micro-/ nanoparticles , and rough or abrupt interfaces , but on modulated core radius. Previous quantitative studies of the relationship between structural parameters and radiation losses<symptom> provide initial conditions for tailoring side-emission through core-diameter modulations , however , with strongly limited amplitude of modulation. We now employ and verify numerical simulation to overcome this limitation towards meter-long homogeneously side-emitting waveguides in which the amplitude of core-diameter modulation is of the same order of magnitude as the core diameter itself. Similar emission properties can be obtained through modulation of the core refractive index instead of the core diameter , or through a combination of both approaches. Using the present model , we deduce exemplary conditions for homogeneous side-emission in which the power flow within the waveguides decays linearly , what may present another interesting feature for applications beyond illumination.
