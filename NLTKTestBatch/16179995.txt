 Scoliosis is a complex three-dimensional deformity. While the frontal profile is well understood , increasing attention has turned to balance in the sagittal plane. The present study evaluated changes in sagittal spino-pelvic parameters in a large Hungarian population with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. EOS 2D/3D images of 458 scoliotic and 69 control cases were analyzed. After performing 3D reconstructions , the sagittal parameters were assessed as a whole and by curve type using independent sample Patients with scoliosis had significantly decreased thoracic kyphosis ( Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients showed a significant decrease in thoracic kyphosis , and the magnitude of the decrease was directly related to the Cobb angle. Changes in pelvic incidence were minimal but were also significantly correlated with thoracic changes. Changes were similar though not identical to those seen in other Caucasian studies and differed from those in other ethnicities. Scoliotic curves and their effect on pelvic balance<symptom> must still be regarded as individual to each patient , necessitating individual assessment , although changes perhaps can be predicted by patient ethnicity.
