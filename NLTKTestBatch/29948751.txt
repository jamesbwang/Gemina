 Mammary epithelial cells ( MEC) are exfoliated from the epithelium into milk , influencing the number of MEC present in the udder. This process is associated with epithelium integrity. The release of oxytocin ( OT) induced by milking causes myoepithelial cell contraction , which , in turn , may stimulate MEC exfoliation through mechanical forces. To investigate the role of OT in MEC exfoliation , we inhibited or induced myoepithelial cell contraction by injecting the OT receptor antagonist atosiban ( Ato) or a supraphysiological dose of OT , respectively. Eight cows were assigned to 2 treatments during 2 milkings according to a crossover experimental design: Control + OT ( cows were first milked to collect standard milk and then received 5 IU of OT to collect residual milk through a second milking) and Ato + OT ( cows were injected with Ato ( 50 Î¼g/kg of body<symptom> weight<symptom>) and milked to collect cisternal milk , then received 5 IU of OT to collect alveolar milk through a second milking). Milk MEC were purified to determine their concentration and number in milk. Mammary epithelium integrity was assessed by measuring the kinetics of plasma lactose concentration. Inhibiting myoepithelial cell contraction by Ato injection decreased the number of exfoliated MEC in milk. In contrast , OT injection increased the concentration of MEC in the residual milk and the number of MEC in the alveolar milk. Ato injection reduced plasma lactose concentration , whereas , in both treatments , OT injections increased it. Our results suggested that myoepithelial cell contraction caused by OT could stimulate MEC exfoliation into milk and was associated with epithelium disruption.
