 To determine if certain patient , clinical , and disease<disease> factors are associated with against medical advice ( AMA) discharge among patients admitted for treatment of alcohol withdrawal<symptom>. Data from admissions to a dedicated unit for treatment of substance withdrawal<symptom> were collected over a 6-month period. Patients with AMA and planned discharge were compared with regard to demographics , clinical data , and substance use disorder disease<disease> characteristics. A stepwise logistic regression was used to find the best model. The study population included 655 patient encounters. A total of 93 ( 14 %) discharges were AMA. Bivariate analysis showed patients with AMA discharge were younger ( mean age 43 vs 46 years; P < 0.05) , more likely to leave on a Tuesday to Thursday , and to have an initial withdrawal<symptom> score at or above the median ( AMA 69 % vs planned 56 %; P = 0.02). Emergency department ( ED) admissions had an AMA discharge rate of 21 % compared with 10 % of community admissions ( P < 0.05). Regression analysis found AMA discharge was significantly associated with admission from the ED ( odds ratio ( OR) 2.03 , confidence interval ( CI) 1.27-3.25) and younger age ( OR 0.97 , CI 0.95-0.99). There was no significant difference in discharge disposition among patients with concurrent opioid use disorder who were on opioid agonist therapy. AMA discharges occurred in 1 of every 7 admissions. Being admitted from the ED and younger age was associated with AMA discharge. No other patient or clinical factors were found to be associated with AMA discharge.
