 Neuroma formation after amputation as a long-term deficiency leads to spontaneous neuropathic pain that reduces quality of life of patients. To prevent neuroma formation , capping techniques are implemented as effective treatments. However , an ideal , biocompatible material covering the nerves<symptom> is an unmet clinical need. In this study , biocompatible characteristics presented by the poly ( D,L-lactic acid)/ arginylglycylaspartic acid ( RGD peptide) modification of poly ( ( lactic acid)-
