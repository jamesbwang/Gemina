 Background Since the Food and Drug Administration approval of balloon sinuplasty ( BSP) in 2005 , no nationally representative population-based studies have examined the outcomes and adverse events of BSP. Objective To assess the rates of complications and revision surgery in patients who received BSP , functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS) , or a hybrid procedure. Methods Using one of the nation 's largest commercial insurance databases , we conducted a retrospective cohort study of pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis between 2011 and 2014 who underwent BSP , conventional FESS , or a hybrid procedure. The primary outcomes were surgical complication and revision rates within 6 months of initial surgery. Results A total of 16,040 patients who underwent sinus surgery were included. Overall , 2,851 patients underwent BSP , 11,955 underwent conventional FESS , and 1 234 underwent a hybrid procedure. BSP surgery was more likely to have been performed in an office setting ( 86.53 %) compared to FESS ( 0.74 %). The complication rate was 5.26 % for BSP and 7.35 % for conventional FESS. Revision rates were 7.89 % for BSP , 16.85 % for FESS , and 15.15 % for a hybrid procedure. Conclusion Despite the low overall risk , major complications occur with BSP including cerebrospinal fluid leak , pneumocephalus , orbital complications , and severe<symptom> bleeding<symptom>. Otolaryngologists should discuss these risks with their patients. Prospective studies are still needed to compare outcomes of BSP with those of FESS.
