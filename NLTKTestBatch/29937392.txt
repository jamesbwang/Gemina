 Neurodegenerative diseases<disease> share a common pathogenetic mechanism involving aggregation and deposition of misfolded proteins , oxidative stress , metal dyshomeostasis , and glutamate exicitotoxicity , which lead to progressive dysfunction of central nervous system ( CNS). A potential strategy to counteract these deleterious events at neuronal level is represented by the employment of a novel class of multi-target therapeutic agents that selectively and simultaneously hit these targets In this paper , we report the metal binding and antioxidant properties of a novel metal-protein attenuating peptide , GSH-LD , a tetrapeptide obtained by linking glutathione , a well-known antioxidant tripeptide , to L-Dopa. Results demonstrated that GSH-LD possesses chelating capabilities in order to selectively target the excess<symptom> of metals without interfere with metal-containing antioxidant enzymes. Moreover , antioxidant assays revealed a large contribution of GSH-LD to restore the antioxidant defences of damaged neuronal cells.
