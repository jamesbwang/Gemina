 OBJECTIVE To assess effects of buprenorphine hydrochloride ( BH) , sustained-release buprenorphine ( SRB) , and high-concentration buprenorphine ( HCB) formulations in healthy rats. ANIMALS 8 Sprague-Dawley rats. PROCEDURES In a crossover-design study , rats received BH ( 0.05 mg/kg) , SRB ( 1.2 mg/kg) , HCB ( 0.30 mg/kg) , or 5 % dextrose solution ( 0.2 mL/kg) , SC , once. Self-injurious behavior and thermal sensitivity ( hind<symptom> limb<symptom> withdrawal<symptom> latencies) were assessed prior to injection<symptom> ( time 0) and 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 hours after injection. Food intake , kaolin intake , and fecal output were measured over 12-hour light and dark periods before and after each treatment. Values were compared among treatments and time points. RESULTS Self-injurious behavior was detected with all buprenorphine treatments; scores were greater at all time points during the 12 hours after HCB and 24 hours after SRB administration than at time 0. Percentage change in hind<symptom> limb<symptom> withdrawal<symptom> latencies from time 0 was higher with BH and HCB 1 hour after injection than at other time points. Postinjection light-period food intake was higher ( BH and HCB) and dark-period food intake was lower ( BH , HCB , and SRB) , compared with preinjection values for the same treatments. For SRB , postinjection light-period kaolin intake was greater than the preinjection value , and postinjection light- and dark-period kaolin intake was greater than that for other treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Hypoalgesic effects were briefly observed after administration of BH or HCB in healthy rats; adverse effects were detected in some rats with all buprenorphine formulations. Studies comparing effects of BH , SRB , and HCB in rats undergoing surgery or other noxious stimuli are indicated to determine clinical benefits in this species.
