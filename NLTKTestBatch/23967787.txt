 Dyspnea<symptom> is one of the most distressing symptoms<symptom> experienced by dying patients , and it is a common reason for such patients to seek care in the emergency department. Many underlying disease<disease> states and acute illnesses cause shortness of breath at the end of life , and management tends to be symptomatic rather than diagnostic , particularly in those for whom comfort is the most important goal. Opioids are the most effective and widely studied agents available for palliation of dyspnea<symptom> in this population , while adjuvant therapies such as oxygen , noninvasive positive pressure ventilation , and hand-held fans may also be used. Benzodiazepines may also be helpful in select patients. The early involvement of palliative medicine specialists and/or hospice services for dying patients can facilitate optimal symptom<symptom> management and transitions of care.
