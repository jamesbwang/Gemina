 Imaging of a 53-year-old Japanese man revealed two tumors in the liver and a tumor in the head<disease> of the pancreas with a swelling lymph node. A needle biopsy for the liver tumors was performed , revealing a neuroendocrine tumor. Enucleation , lymphadenectomy , and partial hepatectomy were performed. The microscopic examination identified many tumor cells with intracytoplasmic inclusions<disease> arranged in a nested , cord , or tubular fashion. The intracytoplasmic inclusions<disease> displayed densely eosinophilic globules and displaced the nuclei toward the periphery , which constitutes `` rhabdoid '' features. The tumor cells were positive for synaptophysin and weakly positive for NCAM , but negative for chromogranin A. Epithelial markers ( AE1/AE3 and CAM5 .2) accentuated intracytoplasmic globules. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with rhabdoid features are very rare. Generally , rhabdoid features are aggressive and dedifferentiated characteristics of various types of tumor. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors containing rhabdoid cells tend to display extrapancreatic spread at the time of presentation , although some of these tumors with rhabdoid features are not always associated with aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom>.
