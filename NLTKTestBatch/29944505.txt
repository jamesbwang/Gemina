 To determine whether silicone hydrogel ( SH) contact lens ( CL) use , with or without meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD) , promotes ocular surface inflammation. Subjects wearing SH-CL for at least 6 months who also had coexisting MGD ( group 1 , n = 20) , SH-CL users who did not have MGD ( group 2 , n = 20) , patients who had MGD but did not use CL ( group 3 , n = 20) , and healthy CL-naive individuals with no known systemic or ocular diseases<disease> ( group 4 , n = 20) were included in this cross-sectional , single-center study. All subjects underwent tear function tests consisting of tear break-up time ( tBUT) , ocular surface staining , Schirmer test , and the Ocular Surface Disease<disease> Index ( OSDI) questionnaire , as well as determination of tear IL-1RA , IL-1β , IL-2 , IL-2R , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-7 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , IL-13 , IL-15 , IL-17 , IFN-α , IFN-γ , TNF-α , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , IP-10 , monokine induced by gamma interferon , RANTES , eotaxin , MIP-1α , MIP-1β , and MCP-1 levels using Luminex multicytokine immunobead assay. Intergroup comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test. The tBUT was lower ( P = 0.048) and ocular surface staining ( P = 0.032) as well as OSDI scores ( P = 0.001) were higher in group 1 but not in groups 2 or 3 when compared with those in the control group. Tear cytokine levels were similar across all groups. None of the tear cytokine levels were elevated in CL wearers ( groups 1 and 2) or those with MGD ( groups 1 and 3) as compared to those in control subjects. Silicone hydrogel contact lens use with concomitant MGD is not associated with cytokine-driven ocular surface inflammation but may impact tear function leading to dry<symptom> eye symptoms<symptom>.
