 Attention control abilities are relevant for learning success. Little is known about the development of audio-visual attention in early childhood. Four groups of children between the ages of 4 and 10 years and adults performed an audio-visual distraction paradigm ( N = 106). Multilevel analyses revealed increased reaction times in a visual categorization task when task-irrelevant novel sounds<symptom> were presented , demonstrating involuntary distraction of attention. This distraction effect decreased with age and significantly differed between age groups. In addition , the two youngest age groups responded with a delay in trials following a distractor trial , indicating delayed reallocation of attention to the task at hand. Results indicate a significant maturation of audio-visual attention control within a few years during early childhood that continues throughout middle childhood.
