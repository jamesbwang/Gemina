 Sensory processing deficits are frequently co-morbid with neurodevelopmental disorders. For example , patients with fragile X syndrome<symptom> ( FXS) , caused by a silencing of the FMR1 gene , exhibit impairments in visual function specific to the dorsal system , which processes motion information. However , the developmental and circuit mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Recently , the superior colliculus ( SC) , a midbrain structure regulating head<disease> and eye<symptom> movements<symptom> , has emerged as a model for dissecting visual circuit development and function. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for activity-dependent processes in the development of visual circuitry in the SC. Based on the known role of the FMR1 gene product in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity , we explored the function and organization of visual circuits in the SC of a mouse model of FXS ( Fmr1 We utilized in vivo extracellular electrophysiology in combination with computer-controlled visual stimuli to determine the receptive field properties of visual neurons in the SC of control and Fmr1 Receptive fields of visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1 Fmr1 is required for the proper development of visual circuit organization and function in the SC. We find that visual dysfunction is heterogeneously manifested in a subcircuit-specific manner in Fmr1
