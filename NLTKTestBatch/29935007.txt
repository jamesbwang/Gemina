 The relative movement of juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus<pathogen> mykiss reared on two treatments was investigated to provide insight on the effect of structure in the rearing environment on the behaviour of the fish before potential release into a natural river<disease> system. The progeny of wild broodstock were reared either in the presence or absence of structure in the tank environment for 7 months at the Oregon Hatchery Research Center located in Oregon , U.S.A. Behavioural assessments , including movement response<symptom> to a simulated predator , showed that fish reared on structure moved a similar amount ( based on line crosses) as fish reared in bare hatchery tanks. No significant difference was observed in the proportion of time spent near a small structure within the behavioural test tank between the two treatments , but all fish showed decreased movement over time with each subsequent predation event. Fish from both treatments spent c. 30 % percent of their time in the section of the tank containing the structure , which was 1 section out of a total of 8 sections. In both treatments , fish foraged 20 % of the time in the 2 min following the introduction of live tubifex prey ( 2 separate events). Overall , similar movement and foraging responses occurred following mock predation events for juveniles reared either with or without structure. Developing assessment tools such as these , that measures behaviours related to survival based on rearing environment should allow managers to better predict the survival and effect of rearing conditions on the release of hatchery-origin fish into the wild.
