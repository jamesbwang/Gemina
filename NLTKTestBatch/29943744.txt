 There is a need to develop and periodically evaluate new treatment strategies in major depression<symptom> due to the high burden of nonresponse and inadequate response to antidepressants. We aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression<symptom> symptom<symptom> scores among individuals with clinically diagnosed major depression<symptom>. Electronic search of databases was carried out for published randomized controlled trials in English language , peer-reviewed journals from inception till August 2017. Outcome measure used for effect size calculation was depression<symptom> symptom<symptom> scores. Effect sizes for the trials were computed using standardized mean difference ( Cohen 's d) , and I A total of four trials involving 948 participants were included in the study. In three trials , the intervention group received oral vitamin D supplementation whereas in one parenteral vitamin D was given. Pooled mean effect size for vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptom<symptom> ratings in major depression<symptom> was 0.58 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.45-0.72). The I Vitamin D supplementation favorably impacted depression<symptom> ratings in major depression<symptom> with a moderate effect size. These findings must be considered tentative owing to the limited number of trials available and inherent methodological bias noted in few of them.
