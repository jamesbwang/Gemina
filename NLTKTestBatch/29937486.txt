 Chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD) affects 8 ‚Åª 16 % of the population worldwide. In developed countries , the most important risk factors for CKD are diabetes , hypertension , and obesity , calling into question the importance of educating and acting on lifestyles and nutrition. A balanced diet and supplementation can indeed support the maintenance of a general health status , including preservation of renal function , and can help to manage and curb the main risk factors for renal damage. While the concept of protein and salt restriction in nephrology is historically acknowledged , the role of some nutrients in renal health and the importance of nutrition as a preventative measure for renal care are less known. In this narrative review , we provide an overview of the demonstrated and potential actions of some selected nutrients , nutraceuticals , and xenobiotics on renal health and function. The direct and indirect effects of fiber , protein , fatty acids , curcumin , steviol glycosides , green tea , coffee , nitrates , nitrites , and alcohol on kidney health are reviewed here. In view of functional and personalized nutrition , understanding the renal and systemic effects of dietary components is essential since many chronic conditions , including CKD , are related to systemic dysfunctions such as chronic low-grade inflammation<symptom>.
