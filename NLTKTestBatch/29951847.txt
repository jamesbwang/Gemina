 To evaluate signal changes in the hippocampus of epileptic<symptom> seizure<symptom> rat models , based on quantified creatine chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CrCEST) signals. CEST data and Measured CrCEST signals were exhibited significant differences between before and after KA injection in the ES group. At each time point , CrCEST signals showed significant correlations with PCr concentration ( all | r | > 0.59; all P < 0.05); no significant correlations were found between CrCEST signals and tCr concentrations ( all | r | < 0.22; all P > 0.05). CrCEST can adequately detect changes in the concentration of Cr as a result of energy metabolism , and may serve as a potentially useful tool for diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in epilepsy.
