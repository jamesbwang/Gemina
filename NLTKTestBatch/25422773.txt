 Diabetic foot is one of the most significant and devastating complication of diabetes. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of diabetic foot syndrome<symptom> ( DFS) and the associated risk factors among people with diabetes mellitus. A community based cross-sectional study was carried out among 620 subjects with diabetes mellitus ( DM) in rural areas of Udupi district. The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument was used to identify peripheral neuropathy. Ankle brachial index was used to identify peripheral arterial disease<disease> ( PAD). Subjects with diabetic foot syndrome<symptom> were classified according to the International Working Group on Diabetic Foot ( IWGDF) classification system. The overall prevalence of DFS was 51.8 %. Among them 31.3 , 11.9 and 8.5 % belonged to category 1 , 2 and 3 respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed advancing age , low socio-economic status , sedentary physical activity and longer duration of DM were significant independent correlates of DFS. The overall prevalence of DFS was high among the study population; hence the screening for foot complications should start at the time of diagnosis of diabetes integrated with sustainable patient education at primary care level by training of health care providers at primary care level.
