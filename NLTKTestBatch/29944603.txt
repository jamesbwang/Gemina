 A one-group , repeated-measures study explored the effect of repetitive practice with peer mentoring on skill competence and<symptom> retention<symptom> of vital signs and auscultation of breath and<symptom> heart sounds in baccalaureate nursing students. Vital signs competence significantly increased after repetitive practice with peer mentoring. Skill competence in vital signs and auscultation of breath and<symptom> heart<symptom> sounds<symptom> did not significantly change four months after repetitive practice with peer mentoring. This study suggests that repetitive practice with peer mentoring may show promise to enhance skill competence and<symptom> retention<symptom>; however , more research is needed to support these findings.
