 The pelvic incidence defines the amount of lordosis required in the lumbar spine , and a lumbar lordosis within 11 Â° of the pelvic incidence defines alignment of the lumbo-pelvic region. Pelvic tilt is a compensatory mechanism that allows patients to achieve sagittal balance<symptom> in the setting of decreased lumbar lordosis with the primary compensatory mechanisms being hip extension and knee flexion. Planning an adult lumbar deformity operation requires a comprehensive history and physical examination and thorough radiographic evaluation with the goal of restoring alignment between the pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis and restoring a normal pelvic tilt.
