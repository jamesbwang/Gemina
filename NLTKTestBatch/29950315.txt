 Macrophages are key immune cells for the initiation and development of atherosclerotic lesions<symptom>. However , the macrophage regulatory nodes that determine how lesions<symptom> progress in response to dietary challenges are not fully understood. Liver X receptors ( LXRs) are sterol-regulated transcription factors that play a central role in atherosclerosis by integrating cholesterol homeostasis and immunity. LXR pharmacological activation elicits a robust antiatherosclerotic transcriptional program in macrophages that can be affected by LXRÎ± S196 phosphorylation in vitro. To investigate the impact of these transcriptional changes in atherosclerosis development , we have generated mice carrying a Ser-to-Ala mutation in myeloid cells in the LDL receptor ( LDLR)- deficient atherosclerotic background ( M-S196A
