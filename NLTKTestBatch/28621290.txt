 Laparoscopic or robotic surgery is the main method of treating renal cell carcinoma ( RCC). Laparoscopic surgery can accurately target lesions<symptom> and shorten patient recovery time. Renal endogenous tumors or inferior vena cava tumor thrombi are very difficult to remove using the laparoscopic approach. The emergence of laparoscopic ultrasonography ( LUS) has solved this problem. LUS can assist in the detection of tumor boundaries and the extent of tumor thrombi. The lack of tactile feedback may hinder the development of laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of renal cancer. LUS has become an important tool that has improved the rates of successful surgery. LUS is applied in not only early and locally advanced RCC treatment but also in monitoring ablation therapy , testing renal<symptom> blood perfusion , and exposing renal pedicles. Sonographic techniques used for LUS include initial B-mode , Doppler , and contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS). Contrast agents applied for CEUS do not induce nephrotoxicity and can display renal perfusion more accurately than the regular color Doppler ultrasound. According to current literature , LUS is a promising technique for the treatment of RCC , especially for endogenous RCC or RCC with thrombosis , and for monitoring the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation , although further well-designed studies are warranted.
