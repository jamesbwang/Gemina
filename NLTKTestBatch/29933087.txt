 Chiari malformation type I is typified by the downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum<pathogen> , which can impede cerebrospinal fluid circulation and may lead to syringomyelia. The usual symptoms<symptom> of this condition are neck<symptom> pain<symptom> and posterior headaches<symptom> on Valsalva maneuver. Different surgical procedures have been described for cranio-cervical decompression ( CCD) , without a consensus being reached about the best suited technique. The primary end point of this study was to compare efficacy and complications rate of CCD using dural peeling ( DPe) versus duraplasty ( DP). The secondary end point was to find predictive factors of success of DPe. Twenty-eight consecutive patients with Chiari malformation type I ( 12 women and 16 men) requiring CCD were enrolled at our institution between August 2011 and November 2015. Ten patients ( 35.7 %) underwent DP , and 18 ( 64.3 %) DPe. A standardized magnetic resonance imaging protocol was performed before and at least 3 months after surgery. Symptomatic outcome was evaluated at the last follow-up visit. Overall complications were more frequent in the DP ( 4 patients , 70 %) group than in the DPe ( none) group ( P < 0.05). All patients in the DP group improved clinically but only 12 patients ( 66.7 %) in the DPe group ( P = 0.1). Morphologic evolution at magnetic resonance imaging was similar in both groups. A moderate trend for changes in cerebellar tonsil conformation was shown in patients with clinical improvement ( P = 0.07). Predictive factors of clinical improvement after DPe can not be identified. CCD with DPe was less risky than with DP but had a lower responsive rate ( 66.7 % vs. 100). Larger studies are therefore warranted to assess predictive factors of success of CCD with DPe.
