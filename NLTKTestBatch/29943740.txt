 Moyamoya disease<disease> is an idiopathic , nonatherosclerotic , noninflammatory , chronic progressive cerebrovascular disease<disease> characterized by bilateral stenosis or occlusion of the arteries around the circle of Willis , typically the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries , followed by extensive collateralization , which are prone to thrombosis , aneurysm<disease> , and hemorrhage<symptom>. Secondary moyamoya phenomenon or moyamoya syndrome<symptom> ( MMS) occurs in a wide range of clinical scenarios including prothrombotic states such as sickle cell anemia<symptom> , but the association with other hemoglobinopathies is less frequently observed. We describe a case of a 25-year-old female with hemoglobin E-beta thalassemia who had a rare presentation of MMS in the form of choreoathetoid movements in the left upper and lower extremities. We describe this association , primarily to emphasize thalassemia as an extremely rare but a potential etiology of MMS. Since MMS is a progressive disease<disease> , it is important to diagnose and initiate treatment to prevent worsening of the disease<disease> and recurrence of stroke.
