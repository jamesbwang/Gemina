 Osteochondral resurfacing implants are a promising treatment for focal cartilage defects. Several implant-factors may affect the clinical outcome of this treatment , such as the implant material stiffness and the accuracy of implant placement , known to be challenging. In general , softer implants are expected to be more accommodating for implant misalignment than stiffer implants , and motion is expected to increase effects from implant misalignment and stiffness. 3D finite element models of cartilage/cartilage contact were employed in which implantation angle ( 0 ° , 5 ° , 10 °) and implant material stiffness ( E = 5 MPa , 100 MPa , 2 GPa) were varied. A creep loading ( 0.6 MPa) was simulated , followed by a sliding motion. Creep loading resulted in low maximum collagen strains of 2.5 % in the intact case compared to 11.7 % with an empty defect. Implants mostly positively affected collagen strains , deviatoric strains and hydrostatic pressures<symptom> in the adjacent cartilage , but these effects were superior for correct alignment ( 0 °). The main effect of implant misalignment was bulging of opposing cartilage tissue into the gap caused by the misalignment. This increased collagen strains and hydrostatic pressures<symptom>. Deviatoric strains were increased adjacent to the gap. Subsequent sliding initially increased strains for a stiff , misaligned implant , but generally sliding decreased strains. In conclusion , implants can decrease the detrimental effect of defects , but correct implant alignment is crucial , more than implant material stiffness. Implant misalignment causes a gap , causing potentially damaging cartilage deformation during prolonged loading , e.g. standing , even for soft implants. Mild motion may positively affect the cartilage. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
