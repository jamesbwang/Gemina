 Pressure ulcers<disease><symptom> are frequently observed in spinal<disease> cord injury ( SCI) patients. They can be life-threatening and are a major medico-economic burden. Despite their frequency , their pathophysiology and optimal management are still poorly understood. Most available data comes from non-comparative studies , especially in terms of antimicrobial use. We performed a critical review of the literature and opinions of infectious<disease> disease<disease> specialists based in a French expert center for this disease<disease>. We mainly focused on antimicrobial treatments prescribed in this situation. These infections are usually clinically diagnosed. Microbiological samples are not the gold standard for this assessment. Furthermore , reliable microbiological identification is a major challenge but should help select antimicrobial treatment. Imaging technique could be helpful but can not replace the physical examination. The choice of antimicrobials must consider the potential ecological collateral damages in this vulnerable population. Antimicrobial therapy should be as short as possible , adapted to the microbiological identification , and must have suitable bioavailability. Management of infected pressure ulcers<disease><symptom> is a major concern in disabled patients already highly exposed to antimicrobial treatment and multidrug-resistant organisms colonization. Extensive data is required.
