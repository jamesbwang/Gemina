 Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Diseases<disease> ( EGIDs) are a rare group of disorders that can have varied clinical presentations dependent on the involved segment within the gastrointestinal tract. Eosinophilic gastritis<disease> presents with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> or vomiting<symptom>; Eosinophilic gastroenteritis<disease><symptom> presents with diarrhea<disease><symptom> and anemia/hypoalbuminemia and Eosinophilic colitis<disease> can present with diarrhea<disease><symptom> or bloody<symptom> stools<symptom>. These nonspecific symptoms<symptom> remain poorly understood as to their relationship to the underlying pathogenesis but a significant percentage of patients are atopic. Here we discuss the current literature on EGIDs to promote a practical approach to the diagnosis and care. Review of published literature STUDY SELECTIONS: Clinically relevant literature from 1900-2018 was obtained from a PubMed search. Those which addressed prevalence , diagnosis , clinical manifestations , natural history and treatment of EGID 's were reviewed and are summarized here. Of the total 485 articles found in the search , majority of which were case reports , 71 were selected for review. The natural history of EGIDs is based primarily on case series and small numbers of patients making therapeutic decisions difficult. Treatment remains limited to dietary restriction that is not effective in many patients and topical or systemic corticosteroids whose long-term use is to be avoided if possible. With the seeming increase in all types of EGIDs , phenotypic descriptions are emerging that will likely promote better understanding of the pathogenesis and identification of novel therapeutic targets.
