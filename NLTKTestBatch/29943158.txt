 Overview of current understanding of epigenetic alterations after abiotic stresses during reproductive development in cereals. Abiotic stresses , including heat , drought , cold , flooding , and salinity , negatively impact crop productivity. Various stages during reproductive development are especially sensitive to environmental stresses , which may lead to complete sterility and severe yield losses<symptom>. Plants exhibit diverse responses to ameliorate stress damage. Changes in DNA methylation , histone modification as well as regulation of small RNA and long noncoding RNA pathways have been shown to represent key modulators in plant stress responses. During reproductive development in cereals , various protein complexes controlling histone and DNA methylation have been identified , revealing conserved and novel mechanisms regulating abiotic stress responses in cereals and other plant species. New findings highlight the role of transposable elements during stress periods. Here , we review our current understanding of epigenetic stress responses during male and female gametophyte formation ( germline development) , fertilization , early seed devolvement , and seed maturation in cereals. An integrative model of epigenetic responses during reproductive development in cereals is proposed , emphasizing the role of DNA methylation and histone modifications during abiotic stresses.
