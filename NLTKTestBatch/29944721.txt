 Recent success with B cell depletion therapies has revitalized efforts to understand the pathogenic role of B cells in Multiple Sclerosis ( MS). Using the adoptive transfer system of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<pathogen> ( EAE) , a murine model of MS , we have previously shown that mice in which B cells are the only MHCII-expressing antigen presenting cell ( APC) are susceptible to EAE. However , a reproducible delay in the day of onset of disease<disease> driven by exclusive B cell antigen presentation suggests that B cells require optimal conditions to function as APCs in EAE. In this study , we utilize an in vivo genetic system to conditionally and temporally regulate expression of MHCII to test the hypothesis that B cell APCs mediate attenuated and delayed neuroinflammatory T cell responses during EAE. Remarkably , induction of MHCII on B cells following the transfer of encephalitogenic CD4 T cells induced a rapid and robust form of EAE , while no change in the time to disease<disease> onset occurred for recipient mice in which MHCII is induced on a normal complement of APC subsets. Changes in CD4 T cell activation over time did not account for more rapid onset of EAE symptoms<symptom> in this new B cell-mediated EAE model. Our system represents a novel model to study how the timing of pathogenic cognate interactions between lymphocytes facilitates the development of autoimmune attacks within the CNS.
