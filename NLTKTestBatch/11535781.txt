 Upon nutritional stress , the metabolic status<symptom> of cells is changed by nutrient signaling pathways to ensure survival. Altered metabolism by nutrient signaling pathways has been suggested to influence cellular lifespan. However , it remains unclear how chromatin regulation is involved in this process. Here , we found that histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation ( H3pT11) functions as a marker for nutritional stress and aging. Sch9 and CK2 kinases cooperatively regulate H3pT11 under stress conditions. Importantly , H3pT11 defective mutants prolonged chronological lifespan ( CLS) by altering nutritional stress responses. Thus , the phosphorylation of H3T11 by Sch9 and CK2 links a nutritional stress response to chromatin in the regulation of CLS.
