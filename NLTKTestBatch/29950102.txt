 Persons with and without a family history of dementia report concerns for developing this syndrome<symptom>; yet , less is known about the specific aspects of dementia that are feared. The Fear of Dementia ( FOD) scale was created to assess these concerns. This study examined the psychometric properties of the FOD scale using a sample of middle-aged and older adults ( N = 734). We then explored the factor structure of the scale 2 years later using a smaller sample from the first study ( N = 226). Three factors emerged , highlighting several main areas of concern: Burden and Loss , Quality of Life , and Perceived Social and Cognitive Loss. Preliminary data suggest that the FOD scale is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the multidimensional nature of the concern about developing dementia. Attention to what specifically is feared may help further our understanding of health behaviors , coping , and targeted supports.
