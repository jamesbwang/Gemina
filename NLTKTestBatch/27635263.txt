 The study was to classify lesions<symptom> identified on mammograms using Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System ( BIRADS) grading method. This was in view of ascertaining the rate of occurrence of breast malignancy of the studied population. A retrospective cohort study of 416 mammographic reports of women was undertaken. The reports were written by consultant radiologists of 10 years ' experience and above. The reports were evaluated and characterised using Breast Imaging Reporting and Data system ( BIRADS). Demographic data of patients were sourced from the request cards. The data was entered into a proforma and analysed using SPSS version 17. All request cards with incomplete data were excluded from the study. Using the BI-RADS Classification , the mammographic reports shows that 29.57 % of the lesions<symptom> were benign , and 4.57 % were suspicious and biopsy recommended , while 3.60 % were highly suggestive of malignancy. The right breast was predominantly affected with 42.7 % of the patients ( P < 0.05). Classification of breast lesion<symptom> using BI-RADS grading system is a veritable tool in the diagnosis of the breast lesion<symptom>. The present study shows that 3.6 % of the population has a high index of malignancy.
