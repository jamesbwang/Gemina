 Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome<symptom> is a rare and probably underdiagnosed condition. Renal and ocular manifestations may not occur simultaneously , making the diagnosis more difficult. Nephritis may be asymptomatic; therefore , renal function evaluation is essential for diagnosis. Urinary Î²2-microglobulin levels may be particularly useful. Uveitis , mostly anterior , nongranulomatous and bilateral , occurs usually after the onset of nephritis. Treatment includes corticosteroids and , eventually , other immunosuppressant agents. Renal disease<disease> is usually benign and resolves spontaneously or after treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Uveitis , however , may be chronic or recurrent. The authors described the cases of three pediatric patients diagnosed with tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome<symptom>. The goal of this paper was to warn the medical community over the need to screen patients with uveitis for renal disease<disease>.
