 This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of Se supplementation on metabolic profiles in patients with congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF). This randomised double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was performed among fifty-three subjects with CHF , aged 45-85 years old. Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups to take either 200 µg/d of Se as Se yeast ( n 26) or placebo ( n 27) for 12 weeks. Metabolic profiles were assessed at baseline and at the end of trial. Compared with the placebo , Se supplementation led to significant reductions in serum insulin ( -18 · 41 ( sd 27 · 53) v. +13 · 73 ( sd 23 · 63) pmol/l , P < 0 · 001) , homoeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance ( -1 · 01 ( sd 1 · 61) v. +0 · 55 ( sd 1 · 20) , P < 0 · 001) and a significant increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( QUICKI) ( +0 · 007 ( sd 0 · 03) v. -0 · 01 ( sd 0 · 01) , P = 0 · 007). In addition , Se supplementation significantly decreased LDL-cholesterol ( -0 · 23 ( sd 0 · 29) v. -0 · 04 ( sd 0 · 28) mmol/l , P = 0 · 03) and total-: HDL-cholesterol ratio ( -0 · 47 ( sd 0 · 31) v. -0 · 06 ( sd 0 · 42) , P < 0 · 001) , and significantly increased HDL-cholesterol levels ( +0 · 18 ( sd 0 · 19) v. +0 · 02 ( sd 0 · 13) mmol/l , P = 0 · 001) compared with the placebo. In addition , taking Se supplements was associated with a significant reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP) ( -1880 · 8 ( sd 3437 · 5) v. +415 · 3 ( sd 2116 · 5) ng/ml , P = 0 · 01) , and a significant elevation in plasma total antioxidant capacity ( TAC) ( +30 · 9 ( sd 118 · 0) v. -187 · 9 ( sd 412 · 7) mmol/l , P = 0 · 004) and total glutathione levels ( +33 · 7 ( sd 130 · 4) v. -39 · 2 ( sd 132 · 8) µmol/l , P = 0 · 003) compared with the placebo. When we applied Bonferroni correction for multiple outcome testing , QUICKI ( P = 0 · 11) , LDL-cholesterol ( P = 0 · 51) , hs-CRP ( P = 0 · 17) , TAC ( P = 0 · 06) and GSH ( P = 0 · 05) became non-significant , and other metabolic profiles did not alter. Overall , our study supported that Se supplementation for 12 weeks to patients with CHF had beneficial effects on insulin metabolism and few markers of cardio-metabolic risk.
