 Premature birth affects 10 % of live births<symptom> in the United States , and is associated with alveolar simplification and altered pulmonary microvascular development. However , little is known about the long-term impact prematurity has on the pulmonary vasculature. Determine the long-term effects of prematurity on right ventricular and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics. Preterm subjects ( n = 11) were recruited from the Newborn Lung Project , a prospectively followed cohort at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , born preterm with very low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight<symptom> ( ≤ 1500g; average gestational age 28 weeks) between 1988 and 1991. Control subjects ( n = 10) from the same birth years were recruited from the general population. All subjects had no known adult cardiopulmonary disease<disease>. Right heart catheterization was performed to assess right ventricular and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics at rest and during hypoxic and exercise stress. Preterm subjects had higher mean pulmonary arterial pressures<symptom> ( mPAP) , with 27 % ( 3/11) meeting criteria for borderline pulmonary hypertension ( mPAP 19-24 mmHg) and 18 % ( 2/11) meeting criteria for overt pulmonary hypertension ( mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg). Pulmonary vascular resistance and elastance were higher at rest and during exercise , suggesting a stiffer vascular bed. Preterm subjects were significantly less able to augment cardiac index or right ventricular stroke work during exercise. Among neonatal characteristics , total ventilatory support days was the strongest predictor of adult pulmonary pressure. Young adults born preterm demonstrate early pulmonary vascular disease<disease> , characterized by elevated pulmonary pressures<symptom> , a stiffer pulmonary vascular bed , and right ventricular dysfunction , consistent with an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension.
