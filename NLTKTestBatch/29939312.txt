 Emerging evidence suggests that intestinal dysbiosis is associated with diverse pathological processes. In this study we demonstrated intestinal barrier disruption and aberrant mucosal immunity in 5/6 nephrectomized mice and the effect of probiotics on chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD). CKD was induced in 6-week-old mice by 5/6 nephrectomy. They were fed a lactobacilli mixture for 8 weeks. Serum , urine and stool<symptom> samples were collected for renal function assessments and gut microbiome analyses. Gut permeability , colon heat shock<symptom> protein 70 ( HSP70) and colon epithelial integrity were evaluated and cytokine levels in colon and kidney were measured. Colon leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry and bone marrow-derived cells were cocultured with lactobacilli mixture. In CKD mice , ` leaky gut ' was accompanied by decreased colon HSP70 and claudin-1 expression , whereas it increased pore-forming claudin-2 expression and apoptosis. Although the percentage of regulatory T cells did not differ between CKD and control mice , cytokine expression and the ratio of CX3CR1intermediate: CX3CR1high pro-inflammatory/resident macrophages increased in the colon of CKD mice. Orally administered lactobacilli partially mitigated the CKD-induced ` leaky gut '; restored colon epithelial HSP70 , claudin-1 and claudin-2 expression and decreased apoptosis. Probiotic treatment also restored the CX3CR1intermediate: CX3CR1high macrophage ratio and increased circular dichroism ( CD) 103 + CD11c + regulatory dendritic cells in the colon. These changes suppressed systemic inflammation<symptom> and kidney fibrosis<disease>. Our results suggest that intestinal dysbiosis-associated gut barrier disruption and aberrant mucosal immunity are important for the systemic inflammation<symptom> and progressive fibrosis<disease> of CKD. Targeting the intestine might provide novel therapeutic opportunities for CKD.
