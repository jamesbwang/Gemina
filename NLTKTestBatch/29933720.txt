 Individuals diagnosed with HIV<pathogen> before 1996 had poor prognoses. Few HIV<pathogen> care centers can track patients continuously from the 1980s to present. We determined the sociodemographic , clinical , and health care utilization characteristics of patients diagnosed and followed for > 20 years ( i.e. long-term HIV/AIDS survivors) to understand what factors contributed to survival. All HIV-positive patients diagnosed before 1996 were categorized as active , moved/lost , or died as of 1 January 2016. Baseline sociodemographic , clinical characteristics , antiretroviral therapy ( ART) usage , retention<symptom> , HIV<pathogen> care costs , and health status were analyzed. Of 876 patients , 49.5 % died , 30.3 % moved or left , 20.3 % remained active in care for a median of 23.4 years. At diagnosis , continuously-followed patients were younger with a higher CD4 cell count , attended regular clinic visits at higher frequencies , and had received more ART than patients who moved or died. As of 1 January 2016 , their median age was 57 years ( interquartile range 53-62) , 15 % were aged > 65 years , median CD4 cell count was 591 cells/mm
