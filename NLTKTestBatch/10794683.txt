 We performed acute and chronic studies in healthy and diet-induced obese animals using mouse-specific or monkey-specific dual GLP-1R/ GCGR agonists to investigate their effects on food intake , body<symptom> weight<symptom> , blood glucose control and insulin secretion. The selective GLP-1R agonist liraglutide was used as comparator. The mouse-specific dual agonist and liraglutide were tested in lean wild type , GLP-1R knockout and diet-induced obese mice at different doses. A chronic study was performed in DIO mice to investigate the effect on body<symptom> weight<symptom> , food consumption and total energy expenditure ( TEE) in obese and diabetic monkeys with a focus on body<symptom> weight<symptom> and energy intake. The mouse-specific dual agonist and liraglutide similarly affected glycaemic control. A higher loss in body<symptom> weight<symptom> was measured in dual agonist-treated obese mice. The dual agonist significantly enhanced plasma glucose excursion in overnight fed GLP-1R In DIO mice and non-human primates , dual agonists elicited robust glycaemic control , similar to the marketed GLP-1R agonist , while eliciting greater effects on body<symptom> weight<symptom>. Results from DIO mice suggest that the increase in TEE is caused not only by increased fat oxidation but also by an increase in carbohydrate oxidation.
