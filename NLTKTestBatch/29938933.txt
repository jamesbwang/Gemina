 Cilia are widely distributed throughout the human body , and have numerous roles in physiology , development , and disease<disease>. Ciliary ultrastructure is complex , consisting of nine parallel microtubules doublets , with or without motor dynein arms<symptom> and a central pair of microtubules. Classification of cilia has evolved over time , and currently , four main classes are described: motile and non-motile cilia with a `` 9 + 2 '' structure , and motile and non-motile cilia with a `` 9 + 0 '' structure , which depend on the presence or absence of dynein arms<symptom> and a central pair. Ciliopathies are inherited multisystem disorders of cilia , and may present with a varied spectrum of genotypes and phenotypes. Motor and sensory ciliopathies were historically considered as distinct dysfunctions of motile and non-motile cilia , but recent data indicate that the classical features of motor and sensory cilia may overlap.
