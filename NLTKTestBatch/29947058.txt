 Many chronic health concerns ( obesity , addiction , stress , chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , and depression<symptom>) have garnered recent attention for their increasing frequency , intractability , and serious health consequences. Because they are often difficult to treat and there are not always effective pharmacological treatments , many patients are pursuing behavioral interventions for these conditions. Experimental behavioral intervention studies have shown some efficacy for health , but the mechanisms for these treatments are not well understood. Health neuroscience is a burgeoning field that seeks to link neural function and structure with physical and mental health. Through this lens , initial studies have begun to investigate how behavioral interventions modulate neural function in ways that lead to improvements in health markers and outcomes. Here , we provide a review of these studies in terms of how they modulate key neurobiological systems , and how modulation of these systems relates to physical health and disease<disease> outcomes. We conclude with discussion of opportunities for future research in this promising area of study.
