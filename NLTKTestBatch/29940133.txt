 We sought to evaluate population-based costs variations and predictors of outlier costs for percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL) in the U.S. Using the Premier Healthcare Database , we identified all patients diagnosed with kidney/ureter calculus who underwent PCNL from 2003-2015. We evaluated 90-day direct hospital costs , defining high- and low-cost surgery as those > 90th and < 10th percentile , respectively. We constructed a multilevel , hierarchical regression model and calculated the pseudo-R A total of 114 581 patients underwent PCNL during the 12-year study period. Mean cost in the low-cost group was $ 5787 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 5716-5856) vs. $ 38 590 ( 95 % CI 37 357-39 923) in the high-cost group. Cost variations were substantially impacted by patient ( 63.7 %) and surgical ( 18.5 %) characteristics and less so by hospital characteristics ( 3.9 %). Significant predictors of high costs included more comorbidities ( ≥ 2 vs. 0: odds ratio ( OR) 1.81; p = 0.01) and hospital region ( Northeast vs. Midwest: OR 2.04; p = 0.03). Predictors of low cost were hospital bed size of 300-499 beds ( OR 1.35; p < 0.01) and urban hospitals ( OR 2.77; p = 0.01). Factors less likely to be associated with low-cost PCNL were more comorbidities ( Charlson Comorbidity Index ( CCI) ≥ 2: OR 0.69; p < 0.0001) , larger hospitals ( OR 0.61; p = 0.01) , and teaching hospitals ( OR 0.33; p < 0.0001). Our contemporary analysis demonstrates that patient and surgical characteristics had a significant effect on costs associated with PCNL. Poor<symptom> comorbidity status contributed to high costs , highlighting the importance of patient selection.
