 Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is an immune-mediated disease<disease> with no known cure and insufficient evidence to support a special therapeutic diet to alter symptom<symptom> management or disease<disease> progression. Several studies have reported dietary changes made by people with MS , but there has been limited investigation into experiences surrounding diet in those recently diagnosed. This study explored responses to diet after a recent diagnosis of MS in people living in Western Australia. Eleven adults with MS ( mean time since diagnosis 8 months) participated in semi-structured interviews focusing on responses to diet since MS diagnosis. Interviews were transcribed , coded and analysed using grounded theory principles. Three theme responses emerged; ( 1) the perceived incompatibility of lack of/or generalised dietary advice with disease<disease> seriousness at the time of diagnosis; ( 2) extensive personal research and information seeking with difficulty judging credibility , and ( 3) self-experimentation with diet to either control MS symptoms<symptom> or to cure MS. Given the seriousness of the disease<disease> , there is a perceived gap in dietary information provided at the time of diagnosis. Healthcare professionals should address concerns with alternative therapeutic diets advertised to treat or cure MS , and clearly convey the reasoning for the general healthy dietary recommendations. This would better align advice with the perceptions about the role of diet in MS , assist people with MS in need of information and minimise dietary self-experimentation. Future research should explore the importance of diet for those who have had MS for a longer period of time.
