 We designed and synthesized two room temperature fluorescent π-conjugated liquids 1 and 2 based on N-heteroacene framework , which have one and two thiophene rings. Two π-conjugated liquids showed different electronic properties and rheology behavior. For dithiophene-appended molecule 4 , single-crystallographic X-ray analysis revealed that two thiophene rings hindered acid-recognizing imino-N atoms as well as S atoms of thiophene rings interacted with imino-N atoms on pyradine. On the other hand , monothiophene-appended molecule 1 and 3 had an unhindered imino-N atom located on opposite site for thiophene ring. Upon dissolving acid substances having various pKa values , these slight differences for 1 and 2 gave rise to marked differences in acid-responsive behavior , resulting in various fluorescent colors<symptom> in liquid states. Also , when acid with lower pKa value was dissolved in 1 and 2 , phase transition occurred from isotropic liquid states to self-organized liquid-crystalline phases.
