 The calyxes of roselle ( Hibiscus sabdariffa) are recognized for their high nutraceutical value , since they decrease body<symptom> weight<symptom> and obesity complications , these effects have been attributed mainly to anthocyanins. However , the calyxes comprise important concentration of flavonoids , phenolic and organic acids , which could also contribute to these effects. The objective of this work was to determine the effect of white roselle variety ( Alma Blanca) on obesity and hepatic steatosis in high fat-high fructose diet-fed rats and compare its beneficial effects with the more studied red variety ( Criolla). Aqueous and methanolic extracts were prepared from two roselle varieties , Alma Blanca ( white) and Criolla ( red). The phytochemical profiles were determined using an HPLC-MS , Criolla extracts contain principally anthocyanins , phenolic acids and flavonoids; anthocyanins were not detected in Alma Blanca. The aqueous extracts of both varieties prevented the body<symptom> weight<symptom> gain and decreased adipocytes hyperplasia<disease> on rats fed a hypercaloric diet , in addition , these extracts protected against hepatic steatosis. These benefits were associated with hibiscus , dimethyl hibiscus and hydroxycitric acid. These results demonstrated that calyxes from Hibiscus sabdariffa contain compounds different to anthocyanins with potential benefits to health. The organic acids had the major association with these health benefic effects. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
