 To comparatively examine in-hospital mortality among different underweight body mass index ( BMI) categories in pancreatic cancer patients after pancreatectomy in Japan. We conducted a large-scale multi-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreatectomy between April 1 , 2010 and March 31 , 2016. Patients were classified according to BMI as follows: normal BMI ( 18.50-24.99 kg/m We analyzed 6173 patients from 332 hospitals. The results showed that the severe thinness group had a longer postoperative hospital stay ( 34.4 Â± 25.6 days) and higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia<disease><symptom> ( 5.5 %) than the other groups. The generalized estimating equations accounted for patient demographics , surgical procedure , anesthetic technique , activities of daily living score , and Charlson comorbidity index as covariates. Relative to the normal BMI group , the odds ratios for in-hospital mortality were 0.57 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.26-1.24; P = 0.16) in the mild thinness group , 1.49 ( 0.64-3.48; P = 0.36) in the moderate thinness group , and 2.54 ( 1.05-6.08; P = 0.04) in the severe thinness group. Severe thinness was significantly associated with a higher risk of mortality , and extremely low BMI should be considered a risk factor in pancreatectomy patients.
