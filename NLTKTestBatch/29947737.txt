 Tissue biopsy is commonly used in cancer diagnosis and molecular studies. However , advanced skills are required for determining cancerous status<symptom> of biopsies and tissue origin of tumor for cancerous ones. Correct classification is essential for downstream experiment design and result interpretation , especially in molecular cancer studies. Methods for accurate classification of cancerous status<symptom> and tissue origin for pan-cancer biopsies are thus urgently needed. We developed a deep learning-based classifier , named GeneCT , for predicting cancerous status<symptom> and tissue origin of pan-cancer biopsies. GeneCT showed high performance on pan-cancer datasets from various sources and outperformed existing tools. We believe that GeneCT can potentially facilitate cancer diagnosis , tumor origin determination and molecular cancer studies. GeneCT is implemented in Perl/R on GNU/Linux platforms.
