 Consensus on the definition of airflow obstruction to diagnose COPD remains unresolved. We undertook systematic case finding for COPD in primary care using the fixed ratio ( FR) criterion ( forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ( FEV A total of 3,721 individuals reporting respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> were invited for spirometry. A total of 2,607 attended ( mean age 60.4 years , 52.8 % male , 29.8 % current smokers) and 32.6 % had airflow obstruction by FR ( `` FR + '') and 20.2 % by LLN ( `` LLN + ''). Compared with the LLN +/ FR + group , the LLN-/ FR + group ( 12.4 %) was significantly older , had higher FEV In symptomatic individuals , defining airflow obstruction by FR instead of LLN identifies a significant number of individuals who have less respiratory and more cardiac clinical characteristics.
