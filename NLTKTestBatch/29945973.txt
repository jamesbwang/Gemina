 Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia<symptom> of Charlevoix-Saguenay ( ARSACS) is a neurodegenerative disease<disease> that is caused by mutations in the SACS gene. The product of this gene is a very large 520 kDa cytoplasmic protein , sacsin , with an ubiquitin-like domain ( Ubl) at the N-terminus followed by three large sacsin internal repeats ( SIRPTs) supradomains and C-terminal J and HEPN domains. The SIRPTs are predicted to contain Hsp90-like domains suggesting a potential chaperone activity. In this work , we report the structures of the Hsp90-like Sr1 domain of SIRPT1 and the N-terminal Ubl domain determined at 1.55 Å and 2.1 Å resolution , respectively. The Ubl domain crystallized as a swapped dimer that could be relevant in the context of full-length protein. The Sr1 domain displays the Bergerat protein fold with a characteristic nucleotide-binding pocket , though it binds nucleotides with very low affinity. The Sr1 structure reveals that ARSACS-causing missense mutations ( R272H , R272C and T201K) disrupt protein folding most likely leading to sacsin degradation. This work lends a structural support to the view of sacsin as a molecular chaperone and provides a framework for future studies of this protein.
