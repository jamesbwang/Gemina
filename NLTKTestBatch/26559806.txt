 From September 2016-April 2017 , Am Timan , Chad , experienced a large HEV outbreak in an urban setting with a limited impact in terms of morbidity and mortality. To better understand HEV epidemiology in this context , we estimated the seroprevalence of anti-HEV antibodies ( IgM and IgG) and assessed the risk factors for recent HEV infections ( positive anti-HEV IgM) during this outbreak. A serological survey using simple random sampling was implemented in Am Timan at the tail-end of the outbreak ( sample size aim = 384 household). Household members provided us with blood samples and household heads<symptom> answered questions around water , sanitation and hygiene practices and animal ownership. Blood samples were tested for HEV IgG and IgM antibodies using Enzyme-Immune-Assay ( EIA). We calculated weighted prevalence estimates and prevalence ratios ( PRs) for possible risk factors for recent infection using multivariate Cox regression. We included 241 households ( 1529 participants). IgM prevalence decreased with age: 12.6 % ( < 5 years) to 4.3 % ( > 15 years). IgG prevalence increased with age: 23.5 % ( < 5 years) to 75.9 % ( > 15 years). Risk factors for recent HEV infections included: sharing the sanitation facility with other HHs ( PR 1.72; 95 % CI: 1.08-2.73) , not systematically using soap for HW ( PR 1.85; 95 % CI: 1.30-2.63) and having animals sleeping inside the compound ( PR 1.69; 95 % CI: 1.15-2.50). Evidence suggests that Am Timan was already highly endemic for HEV before the outbreak , potentially explaining the limited extent of the outbreak. Recent infection with HEV was linked to household level exposures. Future HEV outbreak response must include ensuring access to safe water , and reducing household level transmission through active hygiene and sanitation promotion activities.
