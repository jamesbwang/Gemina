 Sepsis<disease> is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused the dysregulation of host inflammatory response and immunosuppression to infection Early recognition and intervention are hence of paramount importance. In this respect the `` sepsis<disease> bundle '' was proposed in 2004 to be instituted in cases of suspected sepsis<disease>. We hypothesised that a combination treatment of the sepsis<disease> bundle with cyclophosphamide would improve the function of the intestinal mucosa<pathogen><symptom> and enhance survival in rats with induced sepsis<disease>. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 different groups: sham , cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP) , cyclophosphamide ( CTX) , imipenem + normal saline ( NS) and imipenem + NS+CTX. Cecal ligation and puncture were used for inducing the polymicrobial sepsis<disease>. Western-blot was used to measure the occludin protein , and ELISA for examining the plasma level of cytokines IL-6 , IL-10 and TNF-Î±. TUNEL assay for testing the intestinal mucosal apoptosis , and hematoxylin-eosin staining for observing the intestinal mucosal changes. The permeability of intestinal mucosa<pathogen><symptom> was determined by the plasma level of FD-70. The results showed that the combination treatment of the sepsis<disease> bundle with cyclophosphamide attenuated cytokine levels , inhibited epithelial cell apoptosis and improved the function of the intestinal barrier. The survival rate of the group treated with the combined therapy was significantly higher than that of the other groups. The combination treatment of sepsis<disease> bundle with cyclophosphamide improves the function of the intestinal barrier and enhances survival in septic rats.
