 Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis<disease><symptom> and is caused by hyperuricaemia. Some studies have found a reduction in plasma urate with vitamin C supplementation. We tested the hypothesis that high plasma vitamin C is causally associated with low plasma urate and low risk of hyperuricaemia , using a Mendelian randomization approach. We measured plasma urate and genotyped for the SLC23A1 rs33972313 vitamin C variant in 106 147 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study , of which 24 099 had hyperuricaemia. We measured plasma vitamin C in 9234 individuals and genotyped for the SLC2A9 rs7442295 urate variant in 102 345 individuals. Each 10 µmol/l higher plasma vitamin C was associated with a -2.3 ( 95 % CI: -0.69 to -3.9) µmol/l lower plasma urate after multivariable adjustments. The SLC23A1 rs33972313 GG genotype was associated with a 9 % ( 5.6 % , 11.9 %) higher plasma vitamin C compared with AA and AG combined but was not associated with plasma urate ( P = 0.31). Likewise , for each 10 µmol/l higher plasma vitamin C the odds ratios for hyperuricaemia were 0.92 ( 0.86 , 0.98) observationally after multivariable adjustments , but 1.01 ( 0.84 , 1.23) genetically. High plasma vitamin C was associated with low plasma urate and with low risk of hyperuricaemia. However , the SLC23A1 genetic variant causing lifelong high plasma vitamin C was not associated with plasma urate levels or with risk of hyperuricaemia. Thus , our data do not support a causal relationship between high plasma vitamin C and low plasma urate.
