 The fate of indigenous surface-water and wastewater antibiotic resistant bacteria<pathogen> in a mild slope stream simulated through a hydraulic channel was investigated in outdoor experiments. The effect of ( i) natural ( dark) decay , ( ii) sunlight , ( iii) cloudy cover , ( iv) adsorption to the sediment , ( v) hydraulic conditions , ( vi) discharge of urban wastewater treatment plant ( UWTP) effluent and ( vii) bacterial species ( presumptive Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom> and enterococci) was evaluated. Half-life time ( T
