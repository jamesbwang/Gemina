 Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT) had become a therapeutic modality in patients with primary tumors , locally recurrent as well as oligometastasis involving the lung. Some modalities of SBRT require fiducial marker ( FM) for dynamic tumor tracking. Previous studies have focused on evaluating bronchoscopic-guided FM placement for peripheral lung nodules<disease>. We describe the safety and feasibility of placing FM using real-time convex probe endobronchial ultrasound ( CP-EBUS) for SBRT in patients with centrally located hilar/mediastinal masses or lymph nodes. This is a retrospective review of patients who were referred to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 's multidisciplinary thoracic oncology program for FM placement to pursue SBRT. Thirty-seven patients who underwent real-time CP-EBUS were included. Patients had a median age of 71 years ( interquartile range ( IQR) , 59.5 to 80.5). The median size of the lesion<symptom> was 2.2 cm ( IQR , 1.4 to 3.3 cm). The median distance from the central airway was 2.4 cm ( IQR , 0 to 3.4 cm). A total of 51 FMs ( median of 1 per patient) were deployed in 37 patients. At the time of SBRT planning , 46 ( 90.2 %) were confirmed radiologically in 32 patients. Patients with unsuccessful fiducial deployment ( n = 5) underwent a second procedure using the same technique. Of those , 3 patients had a successful fiducial placement via bronchoscopy , 1 patient required FM placement by percutaneous computed tomography-guided approach and 1 patient required FM placement through EUS by gastroenterology. CP-EBUS-guided FM placement for patients with malignant lymph nodes and central parenchymal lung lesions<symptom> appears to be safe and feasible.
