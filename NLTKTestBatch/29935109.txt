 Spinal implants are commonly used in the treatment of spinal disorders or injuries. However , the biomechanical analyses of them are rarely investigated in terms of both biomechanical and clinical perspectives. Therefore , the main purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of rod diameter on the biomechanical behavior of spinal implants and to make a comparison among them. For this purpose , three spinal implants composed of pedicle screws , setscrews and rods , which were manufactured from Ti6Al4V , with diameters of 5.5 mm , 6 mm and 6.35 mm were used and a bilateral vertebrectomy model was applied to spinal systems. Then , the obtained spinal systems were tested under static tension-compression and fatigue<symptom> ( dynamic compression) conditions. Also , failure analyses were performed to investigate the fatigue<symptom> behavior<symptom> of spinal implants. After static tension-compression and fatigue<symptom> tests , it was found that the yield loads , stiffness values , load carrying capacities and fatigue<symptom> performances of spinal implants enhanced with increasing spinal rod diameter. In comparison to spinal implants with 5.5 mm rods , the fatigue<symptom> limits of implants showed 13 % and 33 % improvements in spinal implants having 6 mm and 6.35 mm rods , respectively. The highest static and fatigue<symptom> test results were obtained from spinal implants having 6.35 mm rods among the tested implants. Also , it was observed that the increasing yield load and stiffness values caused an increase in the fatigue<symptom> limits of spinal implants.
