 Arterial compliance ( AC) is an index of the elasticity of large arteries. Endothelial dysfunction has been reported to result in reduced arterial compliance , which represents increased arterial stiffness. A reduction in AC is elicited by high-intensity resistance training , however the mechanisms are obscure. Because a single bout of resistance exercise causes a transient increase in circulating plasma endothelin-1 in humans , some vasoconstrictors may play a role in the mechanisms. The present study aimed to investigate whether resistance training-induced decrease in AC is associated with changes in circulating vasoconstrictors levels in young men. Young sedentary men were assigned to control ( n = 5) or training ( n = 9) groups. The training group performed four-week high-intensity resistance training ( weight<symptom> training exercise; three sessions/week). We measured AC and plasma levels of endothelin-1 , angiotensin II , and norepinephrine before and after intervention. Resistance training significantly decreased AC , whereas the changes in plasma levels of neither endothelin-1 , nor angiotensin II , nor norepinephrine were significantly different between the control and the training groups. Moreover , we found no significant correlations between changes in circulating plasma levels ( endothelin-1 , angiotensin II , and norepinephrine) and in the AC. Despite of no alteration of the resting circulating plasma levels ( endothelin-1 , etc.) , we can not exclude a possibility that the tissue/local concentrations of vasoconstrictors ( endothelin-1 , etc.) around the vessels might be increased and also involved in a reduction of AC in the training group. Taken together , the present results suggest that circulating vasoconstrictors ( endothelin-1 , etc.) in plasma are not involved in a reduction in AC by the resistance training.
