 Various risk stratifications in asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome<symptom> ( BrS) have been proposed , but the electrophysiological change that promotes ventricular fibrillation ( VF) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the changes of ECG at the onset of VF compared to ECGs recorded when patients were still asymptomatic. The subjects were composed of 14 patients with VF and 48 consecutive asymptomatic patients with BrS. We compared ECGs before the initial VF ( > 6 months , early phase) with ECGs at the initial VF episode ( late phase). In asymptomatic patients , we evaluated ECGs at two time points with an interval of more than 6 months. We evaluated various ECG markers including type 1 ECG , fragmented QRS ( fQRS , multiple spikes within the QRS complex). ECG parameters of the early and late phases were not different except for decreased ST level and low incidence of type 1 ECG in asymptomatic patients. There were no differences in ECG parameters of the early phase between VF and asymptomatic patients. In VF patients , ECG at the late phase had longer QRS and Tpeak-Tend ( Tpe) intervals and more frequent type 1 ECG and fQRS than did ECG at the early phase. Those changes were associated with initial VF events ( odds ratio ( OR): QRS widening: 11.5 , p < 0.01 , Tpe: 11.6 , p < 0.01 , fQRS: 15.3 , p < 0.01 , type 1 ECG: 6.6 , p < 0.05). QRS and ST-T abnormalities developed in association with the initial VF onset. Aggravation of the conduction disturbance in addition to BrS-ECG promotes VF.
