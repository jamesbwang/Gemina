 Both household food insecurity and household dietary diversity have been found reliable in describing the dietary intake of a population. However , it had not been proven as reliable instrument for assessing nutritional status<symptom> of individuals in a clinical context. There has been a need for evidence on the validity of using proxy and easy dietary indicators for nutritional status<symptom>. A facility based cross sectional study design was employed on 423 people with HIV<pathogen> infection<disease> visiting all ART clinics in Bahir Dar , North Ethiopia. Nutritional status<symptom> was determined by computing BMI. Food insecurity was assessed using household food insecurity access scale. Dietary diversity was measured using a tool adopted from Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance Project. Data were entered to Epidata version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Reliability analysis , sensitivity and specificity analysis were determined. The sensitivity of the household food insecurity access scale and dietary diversity score was 87.9 % and 79.8 % , respectively , while their specificity was 56.2 % and 70.2 %. The AUC at 95 % CI for the household food insecurity access scale and household dietary diversity score were 73.4 ( 68.4-78.4) and 73.1 ( 68.1-78.2) while their cut of point that maximized their sensitivity and specificity was 1 and 6 respectively. Household food insecurity access scale and household dietary diversity score were found to be reliable tools with a Cronbach 's Alpha of 0.926 and 0.799 , respectively. In assessing under nutrition among PLHIV especially in limited resource settings , both the household food insecurity access scale and household dietary diversity score were found valid and reliable proxy indicators for measuring nutritional status<symptom>.
