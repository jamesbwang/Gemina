 Appendiceal lymphomas are exceedingly rare , constituting around 0.015 % of all gastrointestinal lymphoma cases. Burkitt 's lymphoma is the second most prevalent pathology , diagnosed in 25.9 % of patients. We report a case of a 36-year-old male admitted with acute<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> with 2 days of evolution , localized in the right<symptom> lower quadrant<symptom> associated with hyporexia , but no fever<symptom>. On examination he presented abdominal<symptom> tenderness<symptom> on the right iliac fossa. A diagnosis of acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease><symptom> was made clinically. At the post-operative follow up , 2 weeks later , he presented a low<symptom> back<symptom> pain<symptom> of high intensity , associated with swelling of the abdomen , night<symptom> sweats<symptom> , daily fevers<symptom> and weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. The histopathological exam of the appendix revealed diffuse and transmural lymphoid proliferation. Immunohistochemistry suggested high grade B-cell lymphoma indicative of Burkitt 's lymphoma. This patient was staged as a IVxB lymphoma and was submitted into polychemotherapy with a complete clinical response in 8 months.
