 In this research , the aim was to compare hematological data for the differentiation of subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> , migraine attack , and other headache<symptom> syndromes<symptom> during consultation in emergency service. In this research , which was designed as retrospective case control study , hematological parameters ( WBC , HgB , HCT , PLT , lymphocyte<symptom> and neutrophile counts and neutrophile/lymphocyte rates) of the patients consulting to emergency service with SAH and migraine and other consulting patients complaining mainly from headache<symptom> and having normal cranial CT were analysed. Sixty migraine attack patients ( F/M: 47/13) , 57 SAH patients ( F/M: 30/27) , and 53 patients except migraine having normal brain CT ( F/M: 36/17) who were consulted to emergency service with headache<symptom> complaint were included in our research. WBC , Hct , HgB , MCV , PLT , MPV , LY , Neu counts , and NY/LY rates were found to differentiate between SAH and migraine. WBC , PLT , MPV , LY , and Neu rates were found to differentiate between SAH and HS patients. Only Hct , HgB , MCV , and NY/LY rates were found to differ meaningfully between SAH and migraine patients but these rates were not found to have meaningful difference between SAH and HS patients. In addition , an increase in WBC counts and NY/LY rates and decrease in MPV counts in ROC analysis were found to be more specific for SAH. WBC , HgB , HCT , PLT , lymphocyte<symptom> and Neu counts , and NY/LY rates can indicate distinguishing SAH and migraine. WBC , HgB , HCT , PLT , lymphocyte<symptom> and Neu counts can indicate to the clinician a differentiation of SAH and other headache<symptom> syndromes<symptom>.
