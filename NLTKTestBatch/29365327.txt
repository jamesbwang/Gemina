 To evaluate the association between subclinical and clinical chorioamnionitis<disease> and risk of preterm birth ( PTB). Demographic and clinical characteristics were abstracted from medical records and placental examinations performed ( N = 1371 pregnancies including spontaneous and medically-indicated PTBs). Pregnancies were classified as having clinical chorioamnionitis<disease> ( with or without histologic chorioamnionitis<disease>) , subclinical chorioamnionitis<disease> ( histologic , but not clinical , chorioamnionitis<disease>) , or no chorioamnionitis<disease>; pregnancies with histologic chorioamnionitis<disease> were further evaluated for fetal vasculitis. Relative risks for PTB , early and late PTB , and PTB Â± premature rupture of membranes<symptom> ( PROM) were adjusted for maternal characteristics. Clinical ( 4.3 %) and subclinical ( 24.5 %) chorioamnionitis<disease> were not associated with PTB overall. In pregnancies without clinical or subclinical chorioamnionitis<disease> , the risk of PTB with PROM and early PTB was 2.2 % and 8.6 % , respectively. In comparison , clinical chorioamnionitis<disease> was associated with an increased risk of PTB with PROM ( aRR: 3.42 ( 95 % CI: 1.07 , 10.98) , whereas subclinical chorioamnionitis<disease> was associated with increased risk of PTB with PROM ( aRR: 3.92 ( 95 % CI: 2.15 , 7.12)) and early PTB ( aRR: 1.77 ( 95 % CI: 1.18 , 2.64)). Histologic chorioamnionitis<disease> with fetal vasculitis was associated with increased risk of PTB with PROM ( aRR: 7.44 ( 95 % CI: 3.68 , 15.05)) and early PTB ( aRR: 2.94 ( 95 % CI: 1.78 , 4.87)) , whereas histologic chorioamnionitis<disease> without fetal vasculitis was associated with increased risk of PTB with PROM only ( aRR: 2.64 , 95 % CI: 1.27 , 5.50). Subclinical chorioamnionitis<disease> and histologic chorioamnionitis<disease> with fetal vasculitis were associated with early PTB and PTB with PROM but not with PTB overall , likely due to inclusion of indicated PTBs.
