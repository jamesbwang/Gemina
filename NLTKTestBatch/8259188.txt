 Co-infection with hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) and hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> D<disease> ( HDV<pathogen>) is common among human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infected individuals in developing countries and it aggressively accelerates progression of liver disease<disease> to cirrhosis and other complications. There is scarcity of data on HDV<pathogen> in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the sero-prevalence and factors associated with HDV<pathogen> antibody among HIV/HBV co-infected patients attending a large urban HIV<pathogen> clinic in Uganda. We screened 189 HIV/HBV co-infected individuals for anti-HDV immunoglobulin G ( IgG) and performed logistic regression to determine the associated factors. Socio-demographic , clinical data , immunological status , and liver fibrosis<disease> ( as determined by the Aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index and transient elastography) were included. Participants were predominately young and of sound immunologic status ( median age 40 years , median CD4 440 cells/Âµl). 98 % were on ART regimens containing anti-HBV active medications ( 95.2 % were on TDF/3TC while 4.8 % on 3TC containing regimen). Median duration on ART was 36 months ( IQR 22-72). Anti-HDV was detected in 6/198 , 3.2 % ( 95 % CI 1.14-6.92 %) , associated with male gender and a duration of more than 5 years since HIV<pathogen> diagnosis. The sero-prevalence of HDV<pathogen> antibodies among the HIV/HBV co-infected patients is low in a Ugandan urban cohort.
