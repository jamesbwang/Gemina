 Dehydration<symptom> ( DEH) is believed to impair cognitive performance but which domains are affected and at what magnitude of body mass loss ( BML) remains unclear. To conduct systematic literature review and meta-analysis to determine the effect size ( ES) of DEH on cognitive performance and influence of experimental design factors ( e.g. , DEH > 2 % BML). Thirty-three studies were identified , providing 280 ES estimates from 413 subjects with DEH ranging from 1-6 % BML. Outcome variables ( accuracy , reaction time) , cognitive domains , and methods to induce DEH varied. ES were calculated using standardized mean differences and multivariate meta-analysis. Impairment of cognitive performance ( all domains/outcomes) with DEH was small but significant ( ES = -0.21; 95 % CI: ( -0.31 , -0.11) , p < 0.0001) with significant heterogeneity ( Q ( 279) = 696.0 , p < 0.0001; I = 37.6 %). Tasks of executive function ( ES = -0.24; ( -0.37 , -0.12)) , attention ( ES = -0.52; 95 % CI: ( -0.66 , -0.37)) , and motor coordination<symptom> ( ES = -0.40; ( -0.63 , -0.17)) were significantly impaired ( p ≤ 0.01) following DEH; and , attention/motor coordination<symptom> was different ( p < 0.001) from reaction time specific tasks ( ES = -0.10; ( -0.23 , 0.02)). BML was associated with the ES for cognitive impairment ( p = 0.04); consequently , impairment was greater ( p = 0.04) for studies reporting > 2 % BML ( ES = -0.28 , 95 % CI: ( -0.41 , -0.16) compared to ≤ 2 % ( ES = -0.14 , 95 % CI: ( -0.27 , -0.00)). Despite variability among studies , DEH impairs cognitive performance , particularly for tasks involving attention , executive function , and motor coordination<symptom> when water deficits exceed 2 % body mass loss.
