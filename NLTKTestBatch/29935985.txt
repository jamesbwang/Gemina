 The proto-oncogene c-kit , as a marker of interstitial cells of Cajal ( ICCs) in the gastrointestinal tract , plays an important role in the ICCs. Although limited evidences showed c-kit is present in the colonic epithelium but its roles remain unclear. In the present study , we aimed to investigate the expression , location and function of c-kit in the intestinal epithelium. Immunofluorescence , western blotting , and RT-PCR were performed to detect the expression and location of c-kit in the intestinal mucosa<pathogen><symptom> of WT mice. We investigated intestinal epithelial proliferation and migration in vivo by performing 5-Bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) incorporation and Ki-67 staining in WT and Wads
