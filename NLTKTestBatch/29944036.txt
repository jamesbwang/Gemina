 Low back<symptom> pain<symptom> ( LBP) is the most commonly reported cause of disability in people under the age of 45 and is estimated to occur in 60-70 % of the adult population in the industrialized world. This case report describes the use of Pilates-based exercise ( PBE) in the physical therapy management of a patient with persistent chronic low back<symptom> pain<symptom> ( CLBP) following transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. The patient was a 24-year-old female with a 7-year history of LBP presenting 17 months following surgery. The patient remained with constant LBP and right hip<symptom> pain<symptom> at 8/10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS) after completing a course of physical therapy following the lumbar fusion. The PBE intervention lasted for 22 sessions during which the patient demonstrated complete resolution of right hip<symptom> pain<symptom> and remained with intermittent LBP ( 2/10 NPRS) at discharge. Minimally Clinically Important Difference levels for all self-reported outcome measure instruments were exceeded at discharge. The patient returned to work with lifting restrictions. Patients following spine surgery are often excluded in studies of spine stabilization and PBE interventions. This case report describes the use of PBE in the treatment of a patient following spine fusion. Research to elucidate the impact of PBE on patients with CLBP is needed.
