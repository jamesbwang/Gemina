 Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy ( MIDP) has gained in popularity recently. However , the consensus whether to preserve the spleen or not remains inconsistent. In this study , we compared MIDP outcomes between spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy ( SPDP) and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy ( DPS); as well as outcomes between splenic vessel preservation ( SVP) and Warshaw 's technique ( WT). A systematic search of PubMed ( MEDLINE) and Cochrane Library was conducted and the reference lists of review articles were hand-searched. Fifteen relevant studies with 769 patients were selected for meta-analyses of DPS and SPDP; while another 15 studies with 841 patients were used for the analysis between SVP and WT. Compared with the DPS group , SPDP patients had significantly lower incidences of infectious complications ( P = 0.006) and pancreatic fistula<disease> ( P = 0.002) , shorter operative time ( P < 0.001) and less blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( P = 0.01). Compared with WT , SVP patients had significantly lower incidences of splenic infarction ( P < 0.001) and secondary splenectomy ( P = 0.003). Sub-analysis for laparoscopic surgery alone had similar results. Based on this study , SPDP has significantly superior outcomes compared to DPS. When a spleen is preserved , SVP has better outcomes over WT for reducing splenic complications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
