 To determine whether a combination of anti-rheumatic drugs is associated with the risk of coronary artery diseases<disease> ( CAD) in incident rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA) patients. This population-based cohort study used administrative data to identify 6260 newly-diagnosed patients with RA ( age â‰¥ 20 years) as the study group. The study end-point was occurrence of CAD according to the ICD-9-CM codes. Exposure to different combinations of drugs and the risk of CAD was assessed. These included different combinatiosn of celecoxib ( Cx) , hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ) , methotrexate ( MTX) , and sulfasalazine ( SSZ). Patients who never used Cx , HCQ , MTX , or SSZ were used as a reference group. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio ( HR) of disease<disease> after controlling for demographic and other co-morbidities. When the proportionality assumption was violated , the spline curve of the Scaled Schoenfeld residuals was fitted to demonstrate the estimated effect on CAD over time for drug usage. Among RA patients , the adjusted HR ( 95 % confidence interval) of CAD for `` Cx only '' , `` Cx and HCQ ever '' , and `` Cx , HCQ , MTX , and SSZ ever '' , were 0.29 ( 0.19-0.44) , 0.46 ( 0.24-0.88) , and 0.42 ( 0.24- 0.75) , respectively , during the first period of 0-3 , 4 , or 7 years. However , they became 1.04 ( 0.78-1.38) , 1.16 ( 0.62-2.19) , and 0.59 ( 0.32-1.08) , respectively , during the second time period of 3 , 4 , or 7-10 years. The adjusted HR ( 95 % CI) of CAD for `` Cx , MTX , and SSZ ever '' remains constant at 0.12 ( 0.02-0.89). Celecoxib-DMARDs drug combinations were associated with reduced CAD risk on incident RA patients , and some of them exhibited the time-varying drug effect.
