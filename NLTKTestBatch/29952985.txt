 Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> is distributed worldwide , infecting a large population. It can cause focal necrotic retinitis or retinochoroiditis in the human eyes and is one of the most common causes of posterior uveitis. A 68-year-old patient with normal immunity was complained about blurred vision and black shadow in the right eye for 1 week. Combined Yellow-and-white bulged lesions<symptom> in the fundus of the right eye with the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient = 2 and based on the serological indicators , we considered the diagnosis of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> infection-induced retinochondritis. Acetylspiramycin 0.4 QID Ã— 3 weeks , concussive 20 days treatment after 3 days , for a total of 3 months , prednisone 20 mg/day with a weekly reduction of 5 mg for 1 month. After oral acetylspiramycin , topical and systemic corticosteroids for 3 months , the retinal lesions<symptom> were scarred , and inflammation of the anterior chamber and vitreum disappeared. After a 9-month follow-up , the visual acuity was 0.6 , and no active lesions<symptom> were observed in the fundus. The immunocompetent elderly who are in contact with domestic cats may have an opportunistic infection<disease> with toxoplasmosis<disease> leading to primary retinochoroiditis. Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment can get a good clinical prognosis.
