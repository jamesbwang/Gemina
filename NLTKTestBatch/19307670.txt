 Acromioclavicular joint<symptom> instability<symptom> following distal clavicle resection can result in considerable pain and dysfunction<symptom>. We present a review of 13 patients who underwent ACJ stabilization following one or more distal clavicle resection procedures. The mean Quick DASH and CM scores were 26 ( 0-57) and 73 ( 46-100) respectively. All but one patient reported an improvement in the pain component of their CM score and in the work component of the Quick DASH score. Open ACJ stabilization to treat instability following distal clavicle resection resulted in improved functional scores , pain scores and facilitated return to work in most patients.Level of evidence IV.
