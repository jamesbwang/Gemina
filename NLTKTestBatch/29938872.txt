 This study was conducted to correlate and compare the immunoexpression of sex-determining region Y-box 2 ( SOX-2) in oral leukoplakia ( OL) lesions<symptom> with that in normal buccal mucosa ( control). In this observational study , OL with low-risk ( n = 34) and high-risk ( n = 33) dysplasia and control samples ( n = 25) were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for SOX-2. In the epithelium , SOX-2 positive and negative cells , as well as semiautomatic segmentation of the immunopositive nuclear area were counted. Statistical tests included chi-square , one-way analysis of variance , Tukey , and Games-Howell. The level of significance was 5 %. Groups with OL lesions<symptom> ( low and high-risk) showed higher mean numbers of SOX-2 positive cells ( 63.47 ± 25.70 and 68.18 ± 21.17) compared to the control group ( 45.85 ± 27.38) ( p = 0.00). Groups with OL lesions<symptom> ( low and high-risk) exhibited higher mean positive nuclear area ( 0.24 ± 0.47 and 1.09 ± 2.06) compared to the control group ( 0.00 ± 0.01) ( p = 0.01). Oral leukoplakia lesions<symptom> showed a higher expression of SOX-2 , suggesting its contribution to the pathogenesis of OL.
