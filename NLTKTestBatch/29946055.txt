 In patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<disease> rhinovirus<pathogen> infections<disease> can provoke acute worsening of disease<disease> and limited treatment options exist. Viral replication in the host cell induces significant remodeling of intracellular membranes<symptom> , but few studies have explored this mechanistically or as a therapeutic opportunity. We performed unbiased lipidomic analysis on human bronchial epithelial cells infected over a 6 hour period with the RV-A1b strain of rhinovirus<pathogen> to determine changes in 493 distinct lipid species. Through pathway and network analysis we identified temporal changes in the apparent activities of a number of lipid metabolizing and signaling enzymes. In particular , analysis highlighted fatty acid synthesis and ceramide metabolism as potential anti-rhinoviral targets. To validate the importance of these enzymes in viral replication , we explored the effects of commercially-available enzyme inhibitors upon RV-A1b infection<disease> and replication. Ceranib-1 , D609 and C75 were the most potent inhibitors , which confirmed that fatty acid synthase and ceramidase are potential inhibitory targets in rhinoviral infections<disease>. More broadly , this study demonstrates the potential of lipidomics and pathway analysis to identify novel targets to treat human disorders.
