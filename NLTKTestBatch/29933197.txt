 Adolescents who are unemployed and do not attend school or other education face a variety of short- and long-term challenges ranging from economic instability to increased drug and alcohol abuse to loss<symptom> of quality adjusted life years. Intervention programs that reinforce positive youth behaviors may provide more effective solutions to adolescent challenges than programs that attempt to curb maladaptive behaviors. We conducted a longitudinal randomized trial of a residential positive youth development program including a six-month job internship with youth in Jamaica ( N = 785 , 59.3 % Female , Mean Age = 18.3 , SD = 1.7) , which revealed significant main effects on the acquisition of workplace skills and career self-efficacy. Smaller effects were noted for youth assets in unattached Jamaican adolescents based on follow-up six months post treatment.
