 The role of corynebacteria<pathogen> in canine and feline otitis<disease> has not been investigated in detail; however , members of this genus are increasingly recognized as pathogens of otitis<disease> in both human and veterinary medicine. Here we report the first case of feline otitis<disease> associated with the recently described species Corynebacterium<pathogen> provencense. A seven-month old cat presented with a head<disease> tilt and ataxia<symptom> was diagnosed with peripheral vestibular syndrome<symptom> associated with an otitis<disease> media/interna. This took place 6 weeks after resection of a polyp , having initially shown a full recovery with topical ofloxacin and glucocorticoid treatment. Bacteriology of an ear swab yielded a pure culture of corynebacteria<pathogen> , which could not be identified at the species level using routine methods. However , the 16S rRNA gene sequence was 100 % identical to the recently published novel corynebacterium<pathogen> species , Corynebacterium<pathogen> provencense. Whole genome sequencing of the cat isolate and calculation of average nucleotide identity ( 99.1 %) confirmed this finding. The cat isolate was found to contain additional presumptive iron acquisition genes that are likely to encode virulence factors. Furthermore , the strain tested resistant to clindamycin , penicillin and ciprofloxacin. The cat was subsequently treated with chloramphenicol , which lead to clinical improvement. Corynebacteria<pathogen> from otitis<disease> cases are not routinely identified at the species level and not tested for antimicrobial susceptibility in veterinary laboratories , as they are not considered major pathogens. This may lead to underreporting of this genus or animals being treated with inappropriate antimicrobials since corynebacteria<pathogen> are often resistant to multiple drugs.
