 The well-known sensory deficit in lateral medullary syndrome<symptom> ( LMS) involves crossed ipsilateral trigeminal area and contralateral spinothalamic tract area. A 45 year old man was admitted for sudden onset slurring of speech , unsteadiness and sensory complaints. The diagnosis was right lateral medullary syndrome<symptom> due to right Vertebral Artery occlusion. In addition to typical lateral medullary syndromes<symptom> , his sensory deficit involved contralateral half of the face , trunk and limbs. We report this atypical sensory presentation and discuss its neuroanatomical correlation.
