 The major in vitro permeation studies are currently performed in Franz-type diffusion cells because of their simplicity , cost effectiveness and because the experimental conditions can be easily controlled. Apart from the skin , Franz-type diffusion cells can be used with synthetic membranes<symptom>. Nevertheless , they do not emulate the nature of the lipidic matrix , which is responsible for the topical barrier function. This paper offers two new approaches combining different synthetic membranes<symptom> ( Strat-M The molecular structure of lanolin was studied in membranes<symptom> by attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy ( ATR-IR). The water permeability and absorption of lidocaine , diclofenac sodium and betamethasone dipropionate were also studied and compared against free-lanolin membranes<symptom> and skin. The results showed an increasing barrier function after lanolin application in both membranes<symptom> , resulting in a decrease in water permeability. Observing the IR spectra , the lateral packaging of the lipid in the synthetic membranes<symptom> seems to emulate the orthorhombic disposition from the stratum corneum. Moreover , the three substances applied to the lanolin-containing membranes<symptom> have a similar absorption to that of the skin. In conclusion , combining synthetic membranes<symptom> with lanolin may be a useful approach to mimic topical actives & rsquo; absorption.
