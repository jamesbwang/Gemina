 Macrophage activation syndrome<symptom> ( MAS) is a potentially lethal complication of chronic rheumatological conditions like ankylosing spondylitis , rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> , and adult-onset Still 's disease<disease> ( AOSD). It is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome<symptom> caused by immense cytokine release from activated lymphocytes and macrophages. We give an account of the incidence of a twenty years old Asian girl suffering from non-remitting fever<symptom> and an evanescent rash<symptom> for last ten weeks. Physical examination and laboratory work-up suggested high grade fever<symptom> , pancytopenia , hyperferritinemia , hypertriglyceridemia , hypofibrinogenemia and impaired liver function. Bone<disease> marrow biopsy was also done. It showed active hemophagocytosis. She was diagnosed as a case of Macrophage Activation Syndrome<symptom> associated with Adult<disease> Onset Still 's disease<disease>. She was treated with high dose steroids and cyclosporine and recovered completely.
