 For animals , injury is inevitable. Because of this , organisms possess efficient wound<disease> healing mechanisms that can repair damaged tissues. However , the molecular and genetic mechanisms by which epidermal repair is accomplished remain poorly defined. Drosophila has become a valuable model to study epidermal wound<disease> healing because of the comprehensive genetic toolkit available in this organism and the similarities of wound<disease> healing processes between Drosophila and vertebrates. Other reviews in this Special Issue cover wound<disease> healing assays and pathways in Drosophila embryos , pupae and adults , as well as regenerative processes that occur in tissues such as imaginal discs and the gut. In this review , we will focus on the molecular/genetic control of wound-induced cellular processes such as inflammation<symptom> , cell migration and epithelial cell-cell fusion in Drosophila larvae. We will give a brief overview of the three wounding assays , pinch , puncture , and laser ablation , and the cellular responses that ensue following wounding. We will highlight the actin regulators , signaling pathways and transcriptional mediators found so far to be involved in larval epidermal wound<disease> closure and what is known about how they act. We will also discuss wound-induced epidermal cell-cell fusion and possible directions for future research in this exciting system.
