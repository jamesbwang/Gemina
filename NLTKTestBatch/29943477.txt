 Paediatric emergency tapes provide drug dosing based on the patient 's estimated body<symptom> weight<symptom>. Unfortunately , published data revealed an unsatisfactory accuracy. A newly developed digital algorithm for weight<symptom> estimation ( CLAWAR) allowing a three-staged habitus adaptation ( normal , obese , or cachectic; CLAWAR-3) demonstrated a higher accuracy for weight<symptom> estimation compared to paediatric emergency tapes. However , the incidence of incorrectly evaluated habitus was 27 %. A five-staged habitus adaptation with figural images was suggested by Wells et al to improve habitus and weight<symptom> estimation. Therefore , CLAWAR was modified with five habitus stages including figural images ( CLAWAR-5). We hypothized CLAWAR-5 improves the accuracy of weight<symptom> estimation. After obtaining informed written parental consent patients were included in this single centre , prospective clinical observation trial. Body<symptom> weight<symptom> estimations by CLAWAR-3 and CLAWAR-5 within ± 10 % of the actual body<symptom> weight<symptom> were compared. Furthermore , the incidence of correct evaluated habitus was calculated. McNemar Tests were used for statistical analysis. Results presented as median ( interquartiles) , P < .003 considered significant. In total , 312 patients aged 3.3 years ( 0.7-6.6) , with a body length of 95.9 cm ( 70.0-121.2) , weighing 14.8 kg ( 8.1-22.5) , were included. Both CLAWAR-3 and CLAWAR-5 showed equivalent accuracy for weight<symptom> estimation within the ± 10 % interval ( 62.2 % vs 60.6 % , P = .609). Despite adding figural images , the incidence of correct evaluated habitus with CLAWAR-5 ( 46.8 %) was worse than with CLAWAR-3 ( 66.7 %). The five-staged habitus-adapted method could not improve the accuracy of weight<symptom> estimation. Furthermore , the error rate of habitus classification was not reduced by the implementation of figural images.
