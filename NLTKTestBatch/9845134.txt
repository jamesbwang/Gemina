 Abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( AAA) associated with periaortic malignant lymphoma is difficult to differentiate from aneurysmal rupture because of similarities in their clinical presentation and appearance on computed tomography images. We here report a case of AAA associated with periaortic malignant lymphoma diagnosed preoperatively with an absence of typical symptoms<symptom> , showing that AAA in periaortic malignant lymphoma can present without any clinical correlates. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was treated by endovascular repair , which may be safer and more effective than open surgery for AAA associated with malignant lymphoma because of the tight adhesion between the aneurysm<disease> and the lymphoid tissue.
