 <i> Chlamydia<pathogen> psittaci<pathogen> </i> is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium<pathogen> causing respiratory<disease> disease<disease> ( chlamydiosis) or asymptomatic carriage in poultry. In humans , it is a zoonotic agent of ornithosis/psittacosis. Due to low awareness of the disease<disease> and variable clinical presentation , psittacosis<disease> is often remains unrecognised as such by general practitioners. Zoonotic transfer occurs through inhalation of contaminated aerosols , and originates from feathers<symptom> , faecal material and respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom> exudates<symptom>. The aim of this study was to investigate chickens for the presence of <i> Chlamydia<pathogen> sp </i>. from pharyngeal<symptom> and cloacal swabs and review the zoonotic risk for humans. 138 clinically healthy chickens from farms in Slovakia were examined for the presence of <i> Chlamydia<pathogen> sp </i>. The age of the chickens was 6 months. Two different samples were used- pharyngeal swabs and cloacal swabs. Each sample was examined by the molecular PCR method , and in the case of a positive result the identity of the obtained sequences was examined by a BLAST search. Of the total number of 276 examined samples from 138 chickens , 19 ( 6.9 %) showed positivity for <i> C.<pathogen> psittaci<pathogen> </i> infection , 12 ( 8.7 %) which were positive from pharyngeal swabs and 7 ( 5.1 %) from cloacal swabs. None of the chickens were positive in both samples. Phylogenetic examination of the 19 isolates identified in the study , based on the 23S rRNA gene sequence , revealed that the isolates obtained were identical with <i> C.<pathogen> psittaci<pathogen> </i> , and genetically very close to genotypes B and genotype E. <i> C.<pathogen> psittaci<pathogen> </i> infections are apparently emerging in chickens. Chicken-processing plant employees should be considered a risk group for human psittacosis<disease>. There is a need for higher awareness and for efficient risk assessment and management.
