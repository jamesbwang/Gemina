 Pigment nephropathy represents one of the most severe complications of rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis<symptom>. We performed a retrospective observational study to analyze the etiology , clinical manifestation , laboratory profile and outcome in patients with biopsy-proven pigment-induced nephropathy between January 2011 and December 2016. History , clinical examination findings , laboratory investigations and outcome were recorded. A total of 46 patients were included with mean follow-up of 14 ± 5.5 months. Mean age was 40.15 ± 12.3 years , 65 % were males ( male: female , 1.8:1) and ∼ 37 ( 80.4 %) had oliguria. Mean serum creatinine at presentation and peak creatinine were 7.5 ± 2.2 and 12.1 ± 4.3 mg/dL , respectively. Evidence of rhabdomyolysis was noted in 26 patients ( 64 %) and hemolysis<symptom> in 20 patients ( 36 %). Etiology of rhabdomyolysis include snake envenomation ( 10 patients) , seizures<symptom> ( 7) , strenuous exercise ( 5) , wasp sting ( 2) and rifampicin induced ( 2). The causes of hemolysis<symptom> include rifampicin induced ( 7 patients) , sepsis<disease> ( 5) , malaria<disease> ( 3) , mismatched blood transfusion/transfusion reaction ( 3) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( 2). On renal biopsy , two patients had acute interstitial nephritis and two had immunoglobulin A deposits in addition to pigment nephropathy. All except one ( 97.8 %) required hemodialysis ( HD) during hospital stay and mean number of HD sessions was 9 ± 2. A total of three patients with sepsis/disseminated intravascular coagulation died , all had associated hemolysis<symptom>. On statistical analysis , there was no difference between AKI due to rhabdomyolysis and hemolysis<symptom> except for high creatine phosphokinase in patients with rhabdomyolysis and Lactate dehydrogenase level in patients with hemolysis<symptom>. At mean follow-up , five patients ( 12 %) progressed to chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD). Pigment nephropathy due to rhabdomyolysis and hemolysis<symptom> is an important cause of renal<symptom> failure<symptom> requiring HD. The prognosis was relatively good and depends on the etiology; however , long-term studies and follow-up are needed to assess the true incidence of CKD due to pigment nephropathy.
