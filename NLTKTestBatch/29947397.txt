 Organelles play crucial roles in cellular activities and the functions of organelles are related greatly to the pH values , therefore , the bio-imaging of targeted organelles and their related pH sensing is of great importance in biological assays. Herein we report the fluorescence imaging of specific organelles , i.e. , lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum , and their pH sensing with surface regulated carbon dots ( CDs). Carbon dots functionalized with amine groups ( ACDs) are first prepared by hydrothermal treatment of citric acid and urea , and then laurylamine functionalized CDs ( LCDs) are obtained via the conjugation of laurylamine with ACDs. The as-prepared ACDs and LCDs provide clear and bright imaging results for the lysosome and endoplasmic reticulum , respectively. The subcellular targeting features of the two CDs are attributed to their surface chemistries and cellular uptake pathways. Moreover , both the CDs are pH responsive within a certain pH range , i.e. , 4.0-5.4 for ACDs and 6.2-7.2 for LCDs. The ACDs and LCDs are thus successfully applied to visualize the pH fluctuations<symptom> of the lysosome and endoplasmic reticulum in MCF-7 cells.
