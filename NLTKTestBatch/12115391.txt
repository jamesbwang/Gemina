 Most adults with auditory processing disorder ( APD) often have trouble at work. It is possible that these listening problems in adults with APD influence their mental health. Thus , we have to take the subject 's personality and mental<symptom> status<symptom> into consideration when supporting subjects with APD. However , studies on APD in adults are comparatively rare. In this study , we aimed to evaluate the relationships between the results of auditory tests , APD symptoms<symptom> , and psychological status in subjects with APD. This study included 22 adults who complained of listening problems in everyday life , and they underwent auditory processing tests and were questioned regarding their psychological characteristics. From the results of the auditory processing tests , all subjects showed low scores on at least one test; therefore , they were suspected of having APD. Especially , the scores were low on the auditory memory test. Furthermore , subjects with APD show relatively similar psychological characteristics to each other. However , there was no significant relationship between the results of the auditory processing tests and psychological characteristics. We have to take notice of a subject 's psychological state when they perceive their listening difficulties as a large-scale problem and feel anxious as a result. For this purpose , we should take psychological characteristics into consideration at the time of the medical examination interview before audio-psychological testing.
