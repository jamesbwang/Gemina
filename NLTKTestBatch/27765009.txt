 Physicians across specialties need to be skilled at diagnosing and treating depression<symptom> , yet studies show underrecognition and inadequate treatment. Understanding the reasons requires specifying the influence of patient presentation , screening , and physician competence. We deployed an unannounced standardized patient ( SP) case to assess clinic screening and internal medicine ( IM) residents ' practices in identifying , documenting , and treating depression<symptom>. The SP represented a new patient presenting to the outpatient clinic , complaining of fatigue<symptom> , with positive Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ) items 2 and 9 and a family history of depression<symptom>. The SPs assessed clinic screening and IM resident practices; appropriate treatment was assessed through chart review and defined as the resident doing at least 1 of the following: prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI) , making a referral , or scheduling a 2-week follow-up. Of 129 IM residents , 85 ( 66 %) provided appropriate treatment , 79 ( 61 %) appropriately referred , 59 ( 46 %) prescribed an SSRI , and 49 ( 38 %) scheduled a 2-week follow-up , while 40 ( 31 %) did not add depression<symptom> to the problem list. The IM residents who used PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 were more likely to appropriately ( 89 %) versus inappropriately ( 50 %) treat ( The use of unannounced SPs helps identify targets for training residents to provide evidence-based treatment of depression<symptom>.
