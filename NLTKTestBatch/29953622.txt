 ERBB family cell surface receptors , including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR/ERBB1) , are phosphorylated upon binding by various EGF family ligands and signal via multiple kinase pathways. EGFR signaling is enhanced due to mutational activation of EGFR in almost half of glioblastomas , the most common malignant primary brain tumor. Therapeutic targeting of EGFR in glioblastoma has remained largely unsuccessful. Here we profiled 9 long-term ( LTC) and 5 glioma-initiating ( GIC) cell lines for expression and activation of ERBB family receptors and expression of their ligands. Receptors and ligands were abundantly expressed , with patterns overall similar to glioblastoma expression profiles in vivo as deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) database. No differences between LTC and GIC emerged. Irrespective of ligand or receptor expression , neither an EGFR antibody , erbitux , nor an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) , gefitinib , were particularly active against LTC or GIC at clinically relevant concentrations. Self-renewal capacity of GIC was severely compromised by EGF withdrawal<symptom> , but rescued by transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF- Î±) , although not by neuregulin-1 ( NRG-1). Subcellular fractionation indicated high levels of nuclear phosphorylated EGFR in all LTC and GIC. In LN-229 cells , pERBB2 and pERBB3 were also detected in the nucleus. Nuclear pERBB2 was less sensitive , whereas pERBB3 was induced , in response to gefitinib. This study provides an extensive characterization of human glioma cell models , including stem-like models , with regard to ERBB receptor/ligand expression and signaling. Redundant signaling involving multiple ERBB family ligands and receptors may contribute to the challenges of developing more effective EGFR-targeted therapies for glioblastoma.
