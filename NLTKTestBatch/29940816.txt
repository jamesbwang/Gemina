 Although endovascular therapy is becoming an alternative to open surgical repair of splenic artery aneurysms<disease> ( SAAs) , reports on the use of stent grafts for SAA repair are limited. We present our experience of endovascular therapy using a stent graft for the treatment of an SAA that had ruptured into the gastric lumen. We also reviewed 18 cases of stent graft repair for SAAs , including the present case. A 43-year-old man was admitted due to hematemesis<symptom>. Endoscopic examination and contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CT) revealed a dissecting SAA that had ruptured into the stomach. Two 10 Ã— 100 mm Viabahn ( W.L. Gore , Flagstaff , Arizona) stent grafts were used to exclude the aneurysm<disease>. No complications occurred during the procedure. Although postoperative CT showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm<disease> , endoscopic examination showed a discharge of purulent matter from the aneurysm<disease>. Therefore , surgical debridement and omental implantation were added to avoid stent graft infection. Follow-up CT obtained 1 year later showed the residual aneurysm<disease> almost disappeared without any evidence of infection. A literature search in the PubMed database returned 17 cases with sufficient data. Review of these cases , together with the present case , revealed a 100 % technical success rate , 11 % splenic infarction rate , 94 % graft patency rate , and 0 % reintervention rate. Endovascular repair of SAAs using stent grafts appears to be safe and effective. In terms of preserving the blood flow and avoiding splenic infarction , it may be superior to coil embolization. Even in a case with aneurysm<disease> infection , stent graft repair may be an acceptable method to minimize invasion of concomitant surgical intervention.
