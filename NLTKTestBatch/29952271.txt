 Action potential is a form of electric signaling responsibly for conducting neural firing in organisms. Voltage-gated sodium channels ( VGSCs) are key molecules dedicating to the initiation and propagation of action potentials , playing an indispensable role in processing excitable activity. The foundational sensory of human covering vision , auditory , olfactory , taste and tactile perceive the outer world rely on normal physiological function of VGSCs , which play as a root dancing in music of life. The aberrant genetics and endogenous regulation of VGSCs in most cases give rise to related clinical symptom<symptom> such as hyperpselaphesia , parosphresia , and so on. This review highlights recent advances in the study of VGSCs in sensory systems which may facilitate the fresh understanding of VGSCs in sensory information processing and provide a novel pharmacological target for treatment of sensory system related clinical disease<disease>.
