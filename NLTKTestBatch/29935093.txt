 The aim was to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of nebivolol on renal damage in Zucker diabetic fatty ( ZDF) rats , in comparison with those of atenolol and captopril. Animals were divided into: control lean Zucker rats , ZDF rats , ZDF rats orally treated with nebivolol ( 10 mg/kg) , atenolol ( 100 mg/kg) or captopril ( 40 mg/kg) for 6 months. Systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) , blood glucose , kidney structure and function , plasma and kidney levels of nitric oxide ( NO) and asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA) , and oxidant status were evaluated. Kidney expressions of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) , NADPH oxidase ( NOX) isoforms 2 and 4 and subunit p22
