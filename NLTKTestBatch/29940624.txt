 Most percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures are being performed in order to relieve pain in patients with severe osteoporosis and associated stable fractures of one or more vertebral bodies. In addition , vertebroplasty is also recommended for patients suffering from post-traumatic symptoms<symptom> associated with vertebral fractures , patients with large angiomas positioned inside the vertebral body , with an increased risk for collapse fracture and also patients presenting with pain associated with vertebral body metastatic disease<disease>. On another aspect , it is possible that in isolated cases , an orthopedic surgeon confronted with a vertebra plana presentation will recommend bone cement injection into the vertebral bodies adjacent to the fractured one , in order to have a better and more robust substrate for placement of screws or other fixation devices. The aim of our study is to compare results attained by the Department of Interventional Radiology , in performing this procedure , with results attained by following the classical orthopedic treatment procedure , involving non-operative treatment , using medication and bracing varying from simple extension orthoses in order to limit spinal flexion , light bracing for contiguous fractures , presenting either angulation or compression , and for severe cases standard thoracolumbosacral orthoses ( TLSOs).
