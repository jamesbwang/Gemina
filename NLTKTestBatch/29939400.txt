 To define the symptoms<symptom> , signs and treatment outcomes in a population of older patients with Cushing 's disease<disease> ( CD). We analysed the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes in 45 CD patients older than 60 years , in comparison with 90 CD patients younger than 60 , and a control group of 45 older patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. We reviewed preoperative clinical characteristics , medical comorbidities , imaging findings and endocrine testing as well as surgical and endocrine outcomes. Older CD patients had significantly lower body mass index ( BMI) ( P = 0.031) , were more likely to have muscle wasting ( P = 0.006) and women were less likely to have hirsutism ( P = 0.033). Older patients with CD had more medical comorbidities than younger patients , which correlated with a higher ASA grade ( P < 0.001) , but the surgical complication rates were similar in both groups. Surgical remission was achieved in 38/45 ( 84.4 %) older patients and 78/90 ( 86.7 %) younger patients ( P = NS). Recurrent disease<disease> was more frequent in younger patients ( 19.2 %) in comparison with older patients ( 2.6 % , P = 0.019). Older patients with CD appear to have a distinct phenotype with a more catabolic picture , including a lower BMI and greater prevalence of muscle wasting. Surgical outcomes are similar without a significant age-related increase in complications.
