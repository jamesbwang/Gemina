 Pantoea<pathogen> ananatis<pathogen> , a cause of center rot of onion , is problematic in the USA and elsewhere. The bacterium<pathogen> lacks disease<disease> determinants common to most other bacterial pathogens of plants. A genomic island containing the gene pepM was detected within many onion-pathogenic strains of P.<pathogen> ananatis<pathogen> of diverse origins. The pepM gene of P. ananatis putatively encodes a protein that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate , the first step in the biosynthesis of phosphonates and related molecules. This gene appears to be essential for center rot disease<disease>. Deletion of pepM rendered the mutant strain unable to cause lesions<symptom> in leaves of growing onions and water-soaking of inoculated yellow onion bulbs. Furthermore , growth of the deletion mutant in onion leaves was significantly diminished compared to wild-type bacteria<pathogen> , and the mutant failed to cause cell death in tobacco. Complementation of the mutated strain with pepM restored the phenotype to wild-type capability. The pepM gene is the first pathogenicity gene identified that affects bacterial fitness as well as symptom<symptom> development in both leaves and bulbs in a pathogen causing center rot of onion.
