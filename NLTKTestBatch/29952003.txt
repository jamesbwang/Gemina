 Geminin , a DNA replication licensing inhibitor , ensures faithful DNA replication in vertebrates. Several studies have shown that Geminin depletion in vitro results in rereplication and DNA damage , while increased expression of Geminin has been observed in human cancers. However , conditional inactivation of Geminin during embryogenesis has not revealed any detectable DNA replication defects. In order to examine its role in vivo , we conditionally inactivated Geminin in the murine colon and lung and assessed chemically induced carcinogenesis. We show here that mice lacking Geminin develop a significantly higher number of tumors and bear a larger tumor burden compared to sham-treated controls , in urethane-induced lung and AOM/DSS-induced colon carcinogenesis. Survival is also significantly reduced in mice lacking Geminin during lung carcinogenesis. A significant increase in the total number and grade of lesions<symptom> ( hyperplasias<disease> , adenomas and carcinomas) was also confirmed by H&E. Moreover , increased genomic aberrations , identified by increased ATR and γH2AX expression , was detected through immunohistochemistry analysis. In addition , we further analyzed Geminin expression in human colon cancer and found increased expression , as well as positive correlation with ATM/ATR levels and a non-monotonic association with γH2AX. Taken together , our data demonstrate that Geminin acts as a tumor suppressor by safeguarding genome stability , while its overexpression is also associated with genomic instability.
