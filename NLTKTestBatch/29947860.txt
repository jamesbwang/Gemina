 The purpose of this study was to identify posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) symptom<symptom> groups and assess their longitudinal progression during their first year of reintegration among United States ( US) National Guard ( NG) service members. A cohort of NG service members ( n = 886) completed surveys at 6 and 12 months following their return from deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. Latent class analysis ( LCA) and latent transition analysis ( LTA) were used to empirically derive groups based on their PTSD symptoms<symptom> and examine their longitudinal course , respectively. The best fitting model at both assessments was the four-class model , comprising an asymptomatic class ( 6 months = 54 %; 12 months = 55 %) , a mild symptom<symptom> class with elevated hyperarousal symptoms<symptom> ( 6 months = 22 %; 12 months = 17 %) , a moderate symptom<symptom> class ( 6 months = 15 %; 12 months = 15 %) , and a severe<symptom> symptom<symptom> class ( 6 months = 10 %; 12 months = 13 %). Based on LTA , stability of class membership at the two assessments was 0.797 for the asymptomatic class , 0.453 for the mild class , 0.560 for the moderate class , and 0.580 for the severe class. Estimated transition probabilities were greater with respect to transitioning to less severe , rather than more severe , classes over time. The four latent PTSD classes were distinguished primarily by severity; however , the mild symptom<symptom> class was characterized by higher levels of hyperarousal than other symptoms<symptom>. Although the absolute number of individuals within classes remained fairly constant between 6 and 12 months , there was movement between severity classes. Most NG service members without symptoms<symptom> continued to do well during the first year , with only an estimated 7 % moving to the moderate or severe class.
