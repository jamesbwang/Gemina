 Antibody-mediated rejection is responsible for 30-50 % of renal graft failures<symptom>. Differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing plasmablasts depends on the collaboration of follicular helper T cells ( Tfh). We analysed circulating Tfh ( cTfh) in kidney recipients and studied cTfh relationship with anti-HLA antibody production and graft outcome. cTfh were longitudinally analysed in a prospective cohort of patients ( n = 206) , pre- and post-transplantation. Clinical data , HLA sensitization and cTfh function were recorded. Both pre-transplant and 6-month post-transplant cTfh were able to derive IgG-producing plasmablasts. Pre-transplant cTfh were decreased in patients , especially in those who received dialysis. However , these cells were increased in patients with previous allograft or transfusions , and in HLA-sensitized recipients. After transplantation cTfh expanded , significantly more in patients who developed de novo anti-HLA antibodies than in patients who remained unsensitized. Augmented pre-transplant cTfh positively correlated with higher intensity of pre-transplant anti-HLA class I , and de novo anti-HLA class I and anti-HLA class II antibodies. Consistently , pre-transplantation cTfh were higher in patients who experienced acute rejection ( HR = 1.14 ( 1.04-1.25)). Thus , we show a role for Tfh in anti-HLA sensitization and rejection. Multicentre studies with additional patient cohorts are needed to validate these results. Immunosuppressive drugs targeting Tfh could be useful to improve outcome.
