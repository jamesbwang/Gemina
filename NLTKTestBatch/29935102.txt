 Prognostication of patients with cirrhosis is complex , depending on more than just the severity of liver disease<disease>. Scores such as the model for end-stage liver disease<disease> ( MELD) and Child Pugh can assist with prognostication , yet by focusing on physiological parameters they fail to completely capture the elements contributing to a patient 's clinical status<symptom>. Evidence is increasing to support an important role for physical functioning in patient outcomes. Frailty has been increasingly recognised in medical literature over recent years , including in hepatology where it is identified in nearly half of cirrhosis patients. It is a complex construct consisting of multisystemic physiological decline and increased vulnerability to stressors. Diagnosis is complicated by lack of a consensus definition and measurement tool for frailty in cirrhosis. Frailty heralds a poor prognosis , predicting increased morbidity and mortality both pre- and postliver transplant , independent of MELD score. It is thought to be reversible , with promising data supporting prehabilitation and lifestyle intervention programs. In the future , assessment of patients with cirrhosis is likely to incorporate a measure of frailty , however , further research is required.
