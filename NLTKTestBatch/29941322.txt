 Conventionally , pelvic fracture-related acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage<symptom> ( ARH) is life threatening and difficult to control. However , the use of angioembolization to treat fracture-associated ARH improves the hemodynamic stability of patients with pelvic fractures. The role of angioembolization in the management of patients with pelvic fracture-related ARH was examined. We retrospectively reviewed a large case series of patients with pelvic fractures between January 2010 and December 2014. Comparisons were made between patients with and without ARH. In addition , the characteristics of mortality were delineated , whereas the causes of death in patients with pelvic fracture were discussed and analyzed. A total of 1070 patient records were reviewed during the 60-month study period , and the overall mortality rate of pelvic fracture was 7.7 % ( 82/1070). However , there were only seven patients who died due to uncontrolled ARH ( 0.7 %). The patients with ARH had more injuries to other organs than did the patients without ARH ( head<disease>: 79.7 % vs. 31.7 % , p < 0.001; chest: 50.3 % vs. 10.9 % , p < 0.001; abdomen: 72.0 % vs. 22.7 % , p < 0.001; spine: 12.6 % vs. 4.4 % , p < 0.001; extremities: 69.2 % vs. 44.3 % , p < 0.001). The treatment for pelvic fracture patients declared dead upon arrival remains limited. However , pelvic fracture-related ARH could be controlled effectively with angioembolization. In addition to ARH , injuries to other organs may play a key role in the mortality of patients with pelvic fractures.
