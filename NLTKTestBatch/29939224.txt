 Regulation of vascular tone by 3 ' ,5 '- cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP) involves many effectors , including the large conductance , Ca2 +- activated , K + ( BKCa) channels. In arteries , cAMP is mainly hydrolyzed by type 3 and 4 phosphodiesterases ( PDE3 , PDE4). Here , we examined the specific contribution of BKCa channels to tone regulation by these PDEs in rat coronary arteries , and how this is altered in heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Concomitant application of PDE3 ( cilostamide) and PDE4 ( Ro-20-1724) inhibitors increased BKCa unitary channel activity in isolated myocytes from rat coronary arteries. Myography was conducted in isolated , U46619-contracted coronary arteries. Cilostamide or Ro-20-1724 induced a vasorelaxation that was greatly reduced by iberiotoxin , a BKCa channel blocker. Ro-20-1724 and cilostamide potentiated the relaxation induced by the β-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline or the adenylyl cyclase activator L-858051. Iberiotoxin abolished the effect of PDE inhibitors on isoprenaline but did not on L-858051. In coronary arteries from rats with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> induced by aortic stenosis , contractility and response to acetylcholine were dramatically reduced compared to arteries from sham rats , but relaxation to PDE inhibitors was retained. Interestingly , however , iberiotoxin had no effect on Ro-20-1724- and cilostamide-induced vasorelaxations in heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Expression of the BKCa channel α-subunit , of a 98 kDa PDE3A and of a 80 kDa PDE4D were lower in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> compared to sham coronary arteries while that of a 70 kDa PDE4B was increased. Proximity ligation assays demonstrated that PDE3 and PDE4 were localized in the vicinity of the channel. BKCa channels mediate the relaxation of coronary artery induced by PDE3 and PDE4 inhibition. This is achieved by co-localization of both PDEs with BKCa channels , enabling tight control of cAMP available for channel opening. Contribution of the channel is prominent at rest and on β-adrenergic stimulation. This coupling is lost in heart<symptom> failure<symptom>.
