 A scalable electrophoretic deposition ( EPD) approach is used to create novel thin , flexible and lightweight carbon nanotube-based textile pressure sensors. The pressure sensors can be produced using an extensive variety of natural and synthetic fibers. These piezoresistive sensors are sensitive to pressures<symptom> ranging from the tactile range ( < 10 kPa) , in the body<symptom> weight<symptom> range ( ~ 500 kPa) , and very high pressures<symptom> ( ~ 40 MPa). The EPD technique enables the creation of a uniform carbon nanotube-based nanocomposite coating , in the range of 250-750 nm thick , of polyethyleneimine ( PEI) functionalized carbon nanotubes on non-conductive fibers. In this work , non-woven aramid fibers are coated by EPD onto a backing electrode followed by film formation onto the fibers creating a conductive network. The electrically conductive nanocomposite coating is firmly bonded to the fiber surface and shows piezoresistive electrical/mechanical coupling. The pressure sensor displays a large in-plane change in electrical conductivity with applied out-of-plane pressure. In-plane conductivity change results from fiber/fiber contact as well as the formation of a sponge-like piezoresistive nanocomposite `` interphase '' between the fibers. The resilience of the nanocomposite interphase enables sensing of high pressures<symptom> without permanent changes to the sensor response , showing high repeatability.
