 The burden of non-communicable diseases<disease> ( NCDs) is increasing in low and middle-income countries ( LMIC). According to the World Health Organization ( WHO) the largest increase occurs in Africa. Obesity , diabetes mellitus and hypertension ( ODH) are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases<disease> , causing nearly 18 million deaths worldwide. Various risks associated with mining as an occupational activity are implicated in NCDs ' occurrence. This study describes the baseline prevalence of ODH and associated risk factors in the workforce of Tenke Fungurume Mining ( TFM) , in southern Democratic Republic of Congo. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 2,749 employees ' and contractor 's occupational health examination files for 2010. Socio-demographic , occupational , medical , anthropometric and behavioral characteristics were collected and assessed. Disease<disease> status<symptom> regards ODH was based on WHO criteria. A multivariate logistic regression model was used. Overall prevalence of ODH was 4.5 % , 11.7 % , and 18.2 % respectively. Proportions of pre-ODH individuals were 19.7 % , 16.5 % , and 47.8 % respectively. Prevalence of ODH increased with age , professional grade , nature of work , gender and reported alcohol use. Smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day increased risk of diabetes and hypertension , while decreasing obesity. Rates of ODH and associated risk factors are higher in the TFM workforce , than in the general DRC population. This is likely reflective of other mining sites in the country and region. It is evident that ODH are associated with various socio-demographic , occupational , anthropometric , biomedical and behavioral risk factors. A NCD prevention program and close monitoring of disease<disease> and risk factors trends are needed in this population.
