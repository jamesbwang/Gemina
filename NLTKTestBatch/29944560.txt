 The purpose of this study was to review the clinical characteristics , treatment methods , and surgical outcomes of sphenoid sinus mucocele after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. A total of 404 patients who underwent transsphenoidal pituitary surgery between January 2010 and December 2016 were identified. Among them , 5 patients with sphenoid sinus mucocele were included in this study. In our hospital , a single-nostril endonasal endoscopic wide sphenoidotomy is routinely used for pituitary tumor surgery. The occurrence rate of sphenoid sinus mucocele was 1.2 % ( 5/404). Of the 5 patients , 2 were males and 3 were females. Four lesions<symptom> ( 80.0 %) were located in the right sphenoid sinus and 1 lesion<symptom> ( 20.0 %) was located in the left sphenoid sinus. Endoscopic marsupialization for sphenoid sinus mucocele was performed under local anesthesia in all patients. There were no major complications resulting from the surgical intervention , and there was no recurrence at the time of the last follow-up. Sphenoid sinus mucocele after endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is an extremely rare complication. Nasal endoscopy and MRI are useful for diagnosing this lesion<symptom>. Endoscopic marsupialization is a safe and effective procedure for sphenoid sinus mucocele after endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.
