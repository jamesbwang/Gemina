 Accurate detection and classification of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia episodes such as ventricular fibrillation ( VF) and rapid ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( VT) from electrocardiogram ( ECG) is a challenging problem for patient monitoring and defibrillation therapy. This paper introduces a novel method for detection and classification of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia episodes. The ECG signal is decomposed into various oscillatory modes using digital Taylor-Fourier transform ( DTFT). The magnitude feature and a novel phase feature namely the phase difference ( PD) are evaluated from the mode Taylor-Fourier coefficients of ECG signal. The least square support vector machine ( LS-SVM) classifier with linear and radial basis function ( RBF) kernels is employed for detection and classification of VT vs. VF , non-shock vs. shock<symptom> and VF vs. non-VF arrhythmia episodes. The accuracy , sensitivity , and specificity values obtained using the proposed method are 89.81 , 86.38 , and 93.97 % , respectively for the classification of Non-VF and VF episodes. Comparison with the performance of the state-of-the-art features demonstrate the advantages of the proposition.
