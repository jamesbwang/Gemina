 The purpose of the study is to compare the newborns weight<symptom> in singleton term birth following transfer of thawed blastocysts-frozen on either day 5 or day 6 after in vitro fertilization. The retrospective study included 1444 frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer ( FBT) cycles resulting in live singleton births<symptom> between Jan 2013 and Dec 2016. The main outcomes measured were absolute birth weight<symptom> , z-score adjusted for gestational age and gender , and incidence of large-for-gestational-age ( LGA) newborns. Generalized linear model ( GLM) and logistic regression were used in multivariate analyses. Both the absolute birth weight<symptom> ( 3416.49 ± 404.74 vs 3349.22 ± 416.17) and the z-score ( 0.6 ± 0.93 vs 0.41 ± 0.93) were significantly higher on day 6 FBT in comparison with day 5 FBT. The incidence of LGA newborns was also increased on day 6 FBT ( 22.8 vs 14.7 % , P = 0.006). Adjusted for maternal age , BMI , PCOS diagnosis , present of vanishing twin , and embryo quality , the odds ratio ( 95 % confidence interval) for LGA on day 6 FBT comparing with day 5 FBT was 1.76 ( 1.18-2.64). Day 6 FBT is associated with increased birth weight<symptom> and contributes to the incidence of LGA newborns in FBT.
