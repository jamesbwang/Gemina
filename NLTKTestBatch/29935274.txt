 Based on findings from transrectal ultrasound guided ( TRUS) biopsies series , standard sampling of the prostate targets the posterior/peripheral zone. However , a substantial proportion of PCa suspicious MRI PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions<symptom> is located in the anterior segment of the prostate , requiring a deeper placement and targeting of the biopsy needle. Overall , 1,161 patients underwent MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided targeted biopsy. PCa suspicious MRI lesions<symptom> were dichotomized into anterior vs. posterior prostate segments. Patients were stratified according to number of prior negative systematic biopsy ( SB) sessions. Descriptive statistics included frequencies and proportions of mpMRI findings and corresponding histologic results. Targeted biopsy was performed in 513 ( 44 %) SB naïve patients , 396 ( 34 %) patients with one prior negative SB and 252 ( 22 %) patients ≥ 2 prior negative SB. The proportion of patients with exclusively anterior located MRI PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions<symptom> increased from 3.5 to 9.1 % ( p = 0.006) , when patients were stratified according to number of prior SB sessions. Unfavorable primary Gleason patterns 3 +4 and ≥ 4 +3 were more often identified in exclusively- anterior vs. posterior located lesions<symptom> in 31 vs. 21 % ( each , p = 0.016) in 448 patients with either exclusively- anterior ( n = 64) vs. posterior ( n = 384) located MRI PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions<symptom>. Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed these findings. After multiple previous negative SB sessions , the proportion of anterior located MRI lesions<symptom> increase. Such lesions<symptom> harbor a higher amount of unfavorable PCa. Therefore , image-guidance for precise targeting should be considered especially after initial negative TRUS guided SB.
