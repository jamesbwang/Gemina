 The objective of the present study was to compare the clinical performance of screw-retained , monolithic , zirconia , and cemented porcelain-fused-to-metal ( PFM) implant crowns. In a prospective , randomized , clinical , split-mouth trial , 22 patients ' bilateral premolar or molar single-gap were restored with either screw-retained ( test group) or cemented supraconstruction ( control group). Clinical parameters , soft-tissue health , crestal bone-level changes , technical complications , and patient 's subjective feelings were recorded during a follow-up period of 12 months. No implant was lost during the follow-up period. Of the crowns , 4.5 % ( test) and 9.1 % ( control) showed bleeding on probing ( P = 1.000) , and plaque was visible in 13.6 % ( test) and 27.3 % ( control) of the crowns ( P = 0.240). Changes in bone crest level seemed to have no correlation with the restoration method ( P = 0.77/ 0.79). Technical failures<symptom> were observed in three restorations of the test and four of the control group. Evaluation of patients ' satisfaction revealed high acceptance regarding fit , esthetics , and chewing effectiveness in both groups. Over a 12-month follow-up , screw-retained and cemented crowns could show comparable clinical and radiological results regarding soft<disease> tissue health , marginal bone level , and patient satisfaction. Duration of treatment alone was significantly shorter in screw-retained crowns. Prosthetic retention<symptom> methods are related with the occurrence of complications , such as peri-implantitis. However , scientific valuable data that proof superiority of a specific retention<symptom> technique are rare. In single-gap implants , screw retention<symptom> and cementation seemed to achieved comparable results.
