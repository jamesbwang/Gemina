 Both silicone and latex single-balloon Foley catheters are available for cervical ripening but no literature exists to compare them. Local experience suggested more frequent insertion-related accidental rupture of the membranes<symptom> ( acROM) with silicone. To compare the performance of silicone versus latex catheters with respect to acROM and other outcomes. Women undergoing outpatient Foley catheter cervical ripening were randomised to a silicone or latex catheter. Data were collected on the primary outcome , acROM , and secondary outcomes including catheter insertion failure , unplanned hospital admission and patient-reported discomfort , together with intrapartum fever<symptom> and antibiotics for suspected chorioamnionitis<disease> along with general obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Among 534 recruited women , acROM was significantly more common with a silicone compared to a latex catheter at 7.2 % ( 19/265) versus 1.5 % ( 4/269) ( relative risk ( RR) 4.8; 95 % CI 1.7-14.0). Insertion failure was significantly less common with silicone than latex at 2.6 % ( 7/265) versus 9.3 % ( 25/269) ( RR 0.3; 95 % CI 0.1-0.6). However , when the alternative catheter was subsequently tried , the final failure rates were 1.9 % silicone ( 5/265) versus 2.6 % latex ( 7/269). Insertion-related hospital admission was higher with silicone at 9.4 % ( 25/265) than latex at 4.8 % ( 13/269) ( RR 2.1; 95 % CI 1.1-4.1). All other obstetric outcomes were similar between the groups. When used for cervical ripening , a silicone Foley catheter is associated with a higher rate of acROM than a latex catheter but a lower rate of insertion failure. It may , therefore , be reasonable to attempt insertion with a latex catheter initially and manage insertion failures<symptom> with a silicone catheter.
