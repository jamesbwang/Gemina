 REV-ERBα , the NR1D1 ( nuclear receptor subfamily 1 , group D , member 1) gene product , is a dominant transcriptional silencer that represses the expression of genes involved in numerous physiological functions , including circadian rhythm , inflammation , and metabolism , and plays a crucial role in maintaining immune functions. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is tightly associated with various neurodegenerative diseases<disease> and psychiatric disorders. However , the role of REV-ERBα in neuroinflammation is largely unclear. In this study , we investigated whether and how pharmacological activation of REV-ERBα affected lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced neuroinflammation in mouse microglia in vitro and in vivo. In BV2 cells or primary mouse cultured microglia , application of REV-ERBα agonist GSK4112 or SR9011 dose-dependently suppressed LPS-induced microglial activation through the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB) pathway. In BV2 cells , pretreatment with GSK4112 inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB alpha ( IκBα) kinase ( IκK) , thus restraining the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα , and blocked the nuclear translocation of p65 , a NF-κB subunit , thereby suppressing the expression and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines , such as interleukin 6 ( IL-6) and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNFα). Moreover , REV-ERBα agonist-induced inhibition on neuroinflammation protected neurons from microglial activation-induced damage , which were also demonstrated in mice with their ventral midbrain microinjected with GSK4112 , and then stimulated with LPS. Our results reveal that enhanced REV-ERBα activity suppresses microglial activation through the NF-κB pathway in the central nervous system.
