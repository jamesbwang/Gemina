 To determine the association of differential leukocyte counts on admission with efficacy and safety outcomes in acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis ( IVT). Consecutive AIS patients receiving IVT were evaluated at two stroke centers. Differential leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) were determined during initial 12 hours of admission. Efficacy outcomes involved favorable functional outcome ( FFO) ( mRS-scores of 0-1) and functional independence ( FI) ( mRS-scores of 0-2) at three months; whereas safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( sICH) and three-month mortality. Among 657 IVT-treated AIS patients , mean age was 64 ± 14 , 50 % were female and median NIHSS was 7 points ( IQR 4-13). Lower neutrophil , leukocyte and NLR counts were observed in patients with 3-month FFO and FI , whereas higher counts were observed in patients who expired at three months. The best discriminative factor for 3-month FFO and FI were NLR < 2.2 ( sensitivity 51.4 % , specificity 63.1 %) and leukocyte < 8,100/ μL ( sensitivity 57.5 % , specificity 55.1 %) , respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders , NLR < 2.2 was associated with higher odds of FFO ( OR: 1.56; 95 % CI: 1.08-2.24; p = 0.018) , leukocyte count < 8,100/ μL was associated with higher odds of 3-month FI ( OR: 1.69; 95 % CI: 1.11-2.57; p = 0.014) and lower odds of 3-month mortality ( OR: 0.31; 95 % CI: 0.16-0.60; p = 0.001) , whereas combined neutrophil ( < 6,800/ μL) and leukocyte ( < 8,100/ μL) counts were associated with 3-month FI ( OR: 1.73; 95 % CI: 1.13-2.67; p = 0.012). Admission differential leukocyte counts are independently associated with clinical outcomes in AIS patients treated with IVT and might represent potential inflammatory targets for adjunctive neuroprotection in this stroke subgroup.
