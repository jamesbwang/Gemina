 Electronic health records ( EHR) might be a useful resource to study the risk factors and clinical care of people with dementia. We sought to determine the diagnostic validity of dementia captured in linked EHR. A cohort of adults in linked primary care , hospital , disease<disease> registry and mortality records in England , ( CALIBER ( CArdiovascular disease<disease> research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records)). The proportion of individuals with dementia , Alzheimer 's disease<disease> , vascular and rare dementia in each data source was determined. A comparison was made of symptoms<symptom> and care between people with dementia and age- , sex- and general practice-matched controls , using conditional logistic regression. The lifetime risk and prevalence of dementia and mortality rates in people with and without dementia were estimated with random-effects Poisson models. There were 47,386 people with dementia: 12,633 with Alzheimer 's disease<disease> , 9540 with vascular and 1539 with rare dementia. Seventy-four percent of cases had corroborating evidence of dementia. People with dementia were more likely to live in a deprived area ( conditional OR 1.26; 95 % CI: 1.20-1.31 most vs least deprived) , have documented memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> ( cOR = 11.97; 95 % CI: 11.24-12.75) , falls ( cOR = 2.36; 95 % CI: 2.31-2.41) , depression<symptom> ( cOR = 2.03; 95 % CI: 1.98-2.09) or anxiety<symptom> ( cOR = 1.27; 95 % CI: 1.23-1.32). The lifetime risk of dementia at age 65 was 9.2 % ( 95 % CI: 9.0 % -9.4 %) , in men and 14.9 % ( 95 % CI: 14.7 % -15.1 %) in women. The population prevalence of recorded dementia increased from 0.3 % in 2000 to 0.7 % in 2010. A higher mortality rate was observed in people with than without dementia ( IRR = 1.56; 95 % CI: 1.54-1.58). Most people with a record of dementia in linked UK EHR had some corroborating evidence for diagnosis. The estimated 10-year risk of dementia was higher than published population-based estimations. EHR are therefore a promising source of data for dementia research.
