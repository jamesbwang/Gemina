 Large granular lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( LGLL) is a chronic proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes in which over 70 % of patients develop cytopenia<symptom> ( s) requiring therapy. LGLL includes T-cell LGLL ( T-LGLL) and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK-cells ( CLPD-NK). The neoplastic cells in LGLL usually exhibit a single immunophenotype in a patient , with CD8-positive/αβ T-cell type being the most common , followed by NK-cell , γδ T-cell , and CD4-positive/αβ T-cell types. We investigated a total of 220 LGLL cases and identified 12 mixed-phenotype LGLLs ( 5 %): 7 cases with coexistent αβ T-cell and NK-cell clones and 5 with coexistent αβ and γδ T-cell clones. With a median follow-up of 48 months , the clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients appeared similar to those of typical LGLL patients. Treatment was instituted in 9 patients and 5 patients ( 55 %) attained complete hematologic response ( CR) or partial response ( PR). The therapeutic response rate of this cohort is comparable to the reported overall response rate of 40-60 % in typical LGLL patients. Three patients who did not receive any treatment had progressive or persistent cytopenias<symptom>. Interestingly , inverted proportions of two clones at disease<disease> recurrence were identified in 4 patients ( 36 %) and stable clonal proportions in 7 patients ( 64 %). Mixed-phenotype LGLL is rare , and this study underscores the importance of recognizing this rare type of LGLL in patients who may benefit from LGLL treatment.
