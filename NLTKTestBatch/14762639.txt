 Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and disability is common in whiplash-associated disorders ( WAD) , leading to personal suffering , sick leave , and social cost. The cervical spine is heavily dependent on muscular support and whiplash injury can cause damage to the neck<symptom> muscles , but diagnostic tools to measure neck<symptom> muscle impairment and evaluate exercise interventions are lacking. Therefore , the present study investigated ventral neck<symptom> muscle interactions in 26 individuals with chronic WAD randomized to neck-specific exercise ( NSE) or remaining on a waiting list ( WL) in 3 months. We performed real-time , non-invasive ultrasound measurements with speckle tracking analysis and calculated the deformation area and deformation rate in three ventral neck<symptom> muscles. Multivariate statistics were used to analyse interactions between the muscles. After 3 months of NSE , significant improvements were observed in neck<symptom> muscle interactions and pain intensity in the NSE group compared to the WL group. Thus , this study demonstrates that non-invasive ultrasound can be a diagnostic tool for muscle impairment and used to evaluate exercise interventions in WAD and stands to make a breakthrough for better management in chronic WAD.
