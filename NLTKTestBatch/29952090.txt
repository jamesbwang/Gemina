 We investigated which patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) should receive specialist palliative care ( SPC) by first creating a definition of need for SPC in patients hospitalised with HF using patient-reported outcome measures ( PROMs) and then testing this definition using the outcome of days alive and out of hospital ( DAOH). We also evaluated which baseline variables predicted need for SPC and whether those with this need received SPC. PROMs assessing quality of life ( QoL) , symptoms<symptom> , and mood were administered at baseline and every 4 months. SPC need was defined as persistently severe impairment of any PROM without improvement ( or severe impairment immediately preceding death). We then tested whether need for SPC , so defined , was reflected in DAOH , a measure which combines length of stay , days of hospital re-admission , and days lost due to death. Of 272 patients recruited , 74 ( 27 %) met the definition of SPC needs. These patients lived one third fewer DAOH than those without SPC need ( and less than a quarter of QoL-adjusted DAOH). A Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( KCCQ) summary score of < 29 identified patients who subsequently had SPC needs ( area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.78). Twenty-four per cent of patients with SPC needs actually received SPC ( n = 18). A quarter of patients hospitalised with HF had a need for SPC and were identified by a low KCCQ score on admission. Those with SPC need spent many fewer DAOH and their DAOH were of significantly worse quality. Very few patients with SPC needs accessed SPC services.
