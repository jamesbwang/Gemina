 Breast cancer is the most common cancer disease<disease> of women in industrialized countries. Neurotoxic chemotherapy drugs are known to harm peripheral nerves<symptom> and cause a chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN). CIPN is one of the most common adverse events associated with Paclitaxel chemotherapy and may remain present long after the termination of chemotherapy. Thus , it reduces the patients ' quality of life ( QoL) both during chemotherapy and onwards , and can impose a danger on breast cancer survivors due to an increased risk of falling and fall-related injuries. The aim of this randomized-controlled trial ( RCT) ( n = 36) ( IG: intervention group , n = 17) ( CG: control group , n = 19) was to determine whether sensorimotor exercises have a positive effect on physical and psychological parameters in breast cancer patients undergoing neurotoxic chemotherapy ( Paclitaxel). As a result , we were able to show significant improvements in postural stability in monopedal stance ( left leg 16.17 ± 3.67 vs. 21.55 ± 5.33 ( p < 0.001) and right leg 15.14 ± 2.30 vs. 20.85 ± 5.05 ( p < 0.001)) and in bipedal stance ( T1 vs. T0 ,- 0.49 ( IG) vs. + 1.14 ( CG) p = 0.039). These results in posturography correlate with the clinical presentation with intervention group patients scoring significantly better on the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale ( 37.71 ± 2.73 vs. 34.47 ± 3.98 ( p = 0.004)). Moderate strength training successfully prevented a strength loss in the IG that was remarkable in the CG (- 1.60 vs. 0.60 , p = 0.029). Concerning the psychological parameters assessed via EORTC- and MFI-questionnaires , no significant improvements were found. Future studies should focus on the correlation of clinical and posturometry findings and subjective QOL such as the long-term-development of CIPN.
