 Vonoprazan , potassium-competitive acid blocker , is expected to reduce incidence of delayed bleeding after gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD); however , preliminary data to design a large-scale comparative study are lacking. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of vonoprazan in preventing delayed bleeding after gastric ESD. In this single-center randomized phase II trial , a modified screened selection design was used with a threshold non-bleeding rate of 89 % and an expected rate of 97 %. In this design , Simon 's optimal two-stage design was first applied for each parallel group , and efficacy was evaluated in comparison with the threshold rate using binomial testing. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vonoprazan 20 mg ( VPZ group) or lansoprazole 30 mg ( PPI group) for 8 weeks from the day before gastric ESD. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delayed bleeding , defined as endoscopically confirmed bleeding accompanied by hematemesis<symptom> , melena<symptom> , or a decrease in hemoglobin of â‰¥ 2 g/dl. Delayed bleeding occurred in three of 69 patients ( 4.3 % , 95 % CI 0.9-12.2 % , p = 0.047) in the VPZ group , and four of 70 ( 5.7 % , 95 % CI 1.6-14.0 % , p = 0.104) in the PPI group. As only vonoprazan showed significant reduction in delayed bleeding compared with the threshold rate , it was determined to be efficacious treatment. Vonoprazan efficaciously reduced the delayed bleeding rate in patients with an ESD-induced gastric ulcer<disease><symptom>. A large-scale , randomized , phase III study is warranted to definitively test the effectiveness of vonoprazan compared with proton pump inhibitors.
