 ( Purpose) This study aimed to investigate the effect of active vibration exercise using a Flexi-Bar on the balance<symptom> and gait of chronic stroke patients. ( Subjects and Methods) Twenty-two patients with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group ( n = 11 each). The experimental group performed active vibration exercise using a Flexi-Bar. Balance<symptom> was measured using the Berg Balance<symptom> Scale and Functional Reach Test. Gait was measured with the 10-meter Walk Test and Timed Up and Go Test. ( Results) Intragroup comparisons in the experimental group showed significant differences in Berg Balance Scale , Functional Reach Test , 10-meter Walk Test , and Timed Up and Go Test results , whereas intergroup comparisons showed significant differences in Berg Balance Scale , Functional test , 10-meter Walk Test , and TUGT results. ( Conclusion) On the basis of these results , it was concluded that active vibration exercise using a Flexi-Bar effectively improves the balance and gait of patients with chronic stroke.
