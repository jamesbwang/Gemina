 Disordered eating behaviors and cognitions have been extensively examined in samples of individuals with eating disorders , as well as in non-clinical samples. However , such examinations are lacking in the general population. We investigated disordered eating behaviors and cognitions in a community representative sample of 6052 participants in South Australia , aged 15-99 years. Participants were interviewed regarding weight/shape overvaluation , strict dieting , binge eating , purging , low mood and body mass index ( BMI). Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the direct effects between these features. Steiger 's Z test was used to compare the difference between the semi-partial associations of low mood and strict dieting with binge eating. Our findings suggest that similar relationships between strict dieting , low mood , purging and binge eating to those shown in the trans-diagnostic cognitive-behavioral model of eating disorders in clinical samples occur in the general community. However , in the general population , strict dieting was associated with elevated BMIs ( and not with low BMIs as predicated by the model). Although this study does not ascertain any causal relationships in the observed associations , public health messages or services for weight<symptom> reduction in people with higher body weights could potentially benefit from integration with messages addressing mood disorders and purging , in order to reduce potential adverse effects on disordered eating behaviors.
