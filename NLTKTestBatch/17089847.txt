 For positioning a moving target , a maximum intensity projection ( MIP) or average intensity projection ( AIP) image derived from 4DCT is often used as the reference image which is matched to free breathing cone-beam CT ( FBCBCT) before treatment. This method can be highly accurate if the respiratory motion of the patient is stable. However , a patient 's breathing pattern is often irregular. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of irregular respiration<symptom> on positioning accuracy for a moving target aligned with FBCBCT. Nine patients ' respiratory motion curves were selected to drive a Quasar motion phantom with one embedded cubic and two spherical targets. A 4DCT of the phantom was acquired on a CT scanner ( Philips Brilliance 16) equipped with a Varian RPM system. The phase binned 4DCT images and the corresponding MIP and AIP images were transferred into Eclipse for analysis. FBCBCTs of the phantom driven by the same respiratory curves were also acquired on a Varian TrueBeam and fused such that both CBCT and MIP/AIP images share the same target zero positions. The sphere and cube volumes and centroid differences ( alignment error) determined by MIP , AIP and FBCBCT images were calculated , respectively. Compared to the volume determined by MIP , the volumes of the cube , large sphere , and small sphere in AIP and FBCBCT images were smaller. The alignment errors for the cube , large sphere and small sphere with center to center matches between MIP and FBCBCT were 2.5 ± 1.8 mm , 2.4 ± 2.1 mm , and 3.8 ± 2.8 mm , and the alignment errors between AIP and FBCBCT were 0.5 ± 1.1 mm , 0.3 ± 0.8 mm , and 1.8 ± 2.0 mm , respectively. AIP images appear to be superior reference images to MIP images. However , irregular respiratory pattern could compromise the positioning accuracy , especially for smaller targets.
