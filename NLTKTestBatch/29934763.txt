 Temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE) represents a devastating neurological condition , in which approximately 4/5 of patients remain refractory for anti-convulsive drugs. Epilepsy surgery biopsies often reveal the damage pattern of `` hippocampal sclerosis '' ( HS) characterized not only by neuronal loss but also pronounced astrogliosis and inflammatory changes. Since TLE shares distinct pathogenetic aspects with multiple sclerosis ( MS) , we have here scrutinized therapeutic effects in experimental TLE of the immunmodulator fingolimod , which is established in MS therapy. Fingolimod targets sphingosine-phosphate receptors ( S1PRs). mRNAs of fingolimod target S1PRs were augmented in two experimental post status epilepticus ( SE) TLE mouse models ( suprahippocampal kainate/pilocarpine). SE frequently induces chronic recurrent seizures<symptom> after an extended latency referred to as epileptogenesis. Transient fingolimod treatment of mice during epileptogenesis after suprahippocampal kainate-induced SE revealed substantial reduction of chronic<symptom> seizure<symptom> activity despite lacking acute attenuation of SE itself. Intriguingly , fingolimod exerted robust anti-convulsive activity in kainate-induced SE mice treated in the chronic TLE stage and had neuroprotective and anti-gliotic effects and reduced cytotoxic T cell infiltrates. Finally , the expression profile of fingolimod target-S1PRs in human hippocampal biopsy tissue of pharmacoresistant TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for seizure<symptom> relief suggests repurposing of fingolimod as novel therapeutic perspective in focal epilepsies.
