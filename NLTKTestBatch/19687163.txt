 This study was conducted to determine the role of obesity and race in intracerebral haemorrhage ( ICH) outcomes. The Get with the guideline-Stroke database was queried for all admitted patients with spontaneous ICH. Secondary causes of ICH were excluded. Body mass index ( BMI) was classified using the Center for Disease<disease> Control guidelines. Race was classified as White<symptom> or non-White. Demographics , clinical , imaging data were retrieved. Outcome measures were hematoma expansion at 24 h and discharge disposition. A total of 428 patients were included in our analysis. Female gender , past history of congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , diabetes mellitus , HbA1c , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , ICH volume , ICH location , intraventricular haemorrhage and hospital length of stay deferred across BMI categories. On multivariate analysis , along with obese categories , age , ICH location and ICH volume were independent predictors of poor outcomes ( hematoma expansion and poor discharge disposition). After adjusting for these variables , obesity remained a predictor of poor disposition outcome compared with normal and overweight subjects; Normal vs. Obese OR 0.26 CI 0.115-0.593 p = 0.0014; Obese vs. Overweight OR 3.79 CI 1.68-8.52 p = 0.0013. Nonetheless , obesity did not influence hematoma expansion. Overall , BMI-race classification did not influence outcomes. However , among non-Whites , the obese category had higher odds of a poor disposition outcome than normal ( OR 6.84 CI 2.12-22.22 p = 0.0013) or overweight ( OR 8.45 CI 2.6-27.49 p = 0.0004) categories. An obesity paradox in ICH was not observed in our cohort. In the non-White population , patients with obesity were likely to be associated with poor disposition outcome. Similar findings were not observed in White<symptom> population.
