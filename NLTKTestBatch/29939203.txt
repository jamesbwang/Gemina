 Familial cortical myoclonic tremor<symptom> with epilepsy is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease<disease> , characterized by cortical tremor<symptom> and epileptic<symptom> seizures<symptom>. Although four subtypes ( types 1-4) mapped on different chromosomes ( 8q24 , 2p11.1-q12.2 , 5p15.31-p15.1 and 3q26.32-3q28) have been reported , the causative gene has not yet been identified. Here , we report the genetic study in a cohort of 20 Chinese pedigrees with familial cortical myoclonic tremor<symptom> with epilepsy. Linkage and haplotype analysis in 11 pedigrees revealed maximum two-point logarithm of the odds ( LOD) scores from 1.64 to 3.77 ( LOD scores in five pedigrees were > 3.0) in chromosomal region 8q24 and narrowed the candidate region to an interval of 4.9 Mb. Using whole-genome sequencing , long-range polymerase chain reaction and repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction , we identified an intronic pentanucleotide ( TTTCA) n insertion in the SAMD12 gene as the cause , which co-segregated with the disease<disease> among the 11 pedigrees mapped on 8q24 and additional seven unmapped pedigrees. Only two pedigrees did not contain the ( TTTCA) n insertion. Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction revealed that the sizes of ( TTTCA) n insertion in all affected members were larger than 105 repeats. The same pentanucleotide insertion ( ATTTCATTTC) 58 has been reported to form RNA foci resulting in neurotoxicity in spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> type 37 , which suggests the similar pathogenic process in familial cortical myoclonic tremor<symptom> with epilepsy type 1.
