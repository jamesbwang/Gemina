 Laminar heterotopia is a rare condition consisting in an extra layer of gray matter under properly migrated cortex; it configures an atypical presentation of periventricular nodular heterotopia ( PNH) or a double cortex ( DC) syndrome<symptom>. We conducted an original functional MRI ( fMRI) analysis in a drug-resistant epilepsy patient with `` double-cortex ''- like malformation to reveal her functional connectivity ( FC) as well as a wide genetic analysis to identify possible genetic substrates. Heterotopias were segmented into region of interests ( ROIs) , whose voxel-wise FC was compared to that of ( i) its normally migrated counterpart , ( ii) its contralateral homologous , and ( iii) those of 30 age-matched healthy controls. Extensive genetic analysis was conducted to screen cortical malformations-associated genes. Compared to healthy controls , both laminar heterotopias and the overlying cortex showed significant reduction of FC with the contralateral hemisphere. Two heterozygous variants of uncertain clinical significance were found , involving autosomal recessive disease-causing genes , FAT4 and COL18A1. This first FC analysis of a unique case of `` double-cortex ''- like malformation revealed a hemispheric connectivity segregation both in the laminar cortex as in the correctly migrated one , with a new pattern of genes ' mutations. Our study suggests the altered FC could have an electrophysiological and functional impact on large-scale brain networks , and the involvement of not yet identified genes in `` double-cortex ''- like malformation with a possible role of rare variants in recessive genes as pathogenic cofactors.
