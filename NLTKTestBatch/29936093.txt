 Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> ( H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen>) is a human pathogen affecting over 50 % of the world population. This pathogen is usually associated with chronic inflammation<symptom> of the gastric mucosa that can lead to peptic ulcer<disease><symptom> disease<disease> ( PUD) and gastric cancer ( GC) , especially in susceptible individuals. These outcomes have been attributed to the interaction of several factors , including host genetic susceptibility , local innate and adaptive immune responses , virulence factors of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> , and environmental factors. T helper ( Th) cell subsets and their signature cytokines especially IFN-Î³ , contribute to anti-bacterial response , but at the mean time sustaining chronic<disease> inflammatory responses in the site of infection. It has been acknowledged that H. pylori-infection results in a Th1-dominant response and that inflammation<symptom> of the gastric mucosa depends mainly on Th1 cell responses. But , the mechanism of the role of Th1 cell responses in H. pylori-infection has not yet been clearly explained. In this review , we will focus on the role of Th1 involved in H. pylori-infection , its interaction with Th17/Treg cells and its association with the clinical consequences of the infection.
