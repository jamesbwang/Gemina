 People with psychotic disorders account for most acute admissions to psychiatric wards. Psychological therapies are a treatment adjunct to standard medication and nursing care , but the evidence base for such therapies within in-patient settings is unclear.AimsTo conduct a systematic scoping review of the current evidence base for psychological therapies for psychosis delivered within acute in-patient settings ( PROSPERO: CRD42015025623). All study designs , and therapy models , were eligible for inclusion in the review. We searched PubMed , PsycINFO , EThOS , ProQuest , conference abstracts and trial registries. We found 65 studies that met criteria for inclusion in the review , 21 of which were randomised controlled trials ( RCTs). The majority of studies evaluated cognitive-behavioural interventions. Quality was variable across all study types. The RCTs were mostly small ( n < 25 in the treatment arm) , and many had methodological limitations including poorly described randomisation methods , inadequate allocation concealment and non-masked outcome assessments. We found studies used a wide range of different outcome measures , and relatively few studies reported affective symptoms<symptom> or recovery-based outcomes. Many studies described adaptations to treatment delivery within in-patient settings , including increased frequency of sessions , briefer interventions and use of single-session formats. Based on these findings , there is a clear need to improve methodological rigour within in-patient research. Interpretation of the current evidence base is challenging given the wide range of different therapies , outcome measures and models of delivery described in the literature.Declaration of interestNone.
