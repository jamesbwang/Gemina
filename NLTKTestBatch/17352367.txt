 Postural orthostatic tachycardia<symptom> syndrome<symptom> ( POTS) is a debilitating disease<disease> that predominantly affects young women. It is a multifactorial disorder that is characterized by severe tachycardia<symptom> and orthostatic intolerance. Patients with POTS experience a variety of cardiac , neurological , and immunological symptoms<symptom> that significantly reduce quality of life. In this review , a comprehensive framework is provided to aid in helping identify and treat patients with POTS. Given its heterogenous nature , it is crucial to understand each component of POTS in relation to one another instead of distinct parts. The framework highlights the overlap among the five main subtypes of POTS based on its pathophysiology ( neuropathic , hypovolemic , primary hyperadrenergic , joint-hypermobility-related , and immune-related). Emphasis is placed on incorporating a multidisciplinary approach when treating patients with POTS , especially with a new focus towards immunotherapy. Although research has advanced our knowledge of POTS , there is still a critically unmet need to further our understanding and provide patients with the relief they need.
