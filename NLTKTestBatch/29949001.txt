 We aimed to provide a systematic description of our 2-year experience using a standardized bedside , single burr hole approach to intracranial multimodality monitoring ( MMM) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury ( sTBI) , focusing on safety and probe reliability. We performed this observational cohort study at a university-affiliated , Level I trauma center with dedicated 20-bed neuroscience intensive care unit. We included 43 consecutive sTBI patients who required MMM to guide clinical care based on institutional protocol and had a four-lumen bolt placed to measure intracranial pressure , brain tissue oxygen , regional cerebral blood flow , brain temperature , and intracranial electroencephalography. sTBI patients were aged 41.6 ± 17.5 years ( mean ± SD) and 84 % were men. MMM devices were placed at a median of 12.5 h ( interquartile range ( IQR) 9.0-21.4 h) after injury and in non-dominant frontal lobe in 72.1 % of cases. Monitoring was conducted for a median of 97.1 h ( IQR 46.9-124.6 h) per patient. While minor hemorrhage<symptom> , pneumocephalus , or small bone chips were common , only one ( 2.4 %) patient experienced significant hemorrhage<symptom> related to device placement. Radiographically , device malpositioning was noted in 13.9 % of patients. Inadvertent device discontinuation occurred for at least one device in 58 % of patients and was significantly associated with the frequency of travel for procedures or imaging. Devices remained in place for > 80 % of the total monitoring period and generated usable data > 50 % of that time. A standardized , bedside single burr hole approach to MMM was safe. Despite some probe-specific recording limitations , MMM provided real-time measurements of intracranial pressure , oxygenation , regional cerebral blood flow , brain temperature , and function.
