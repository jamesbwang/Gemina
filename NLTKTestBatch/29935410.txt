 To assess the clinical outcome and evolution of recurrent afebrile seizures<symptom> in children initially diagnosed with benign convulsions<symptom> associated with mild gastroenteritis<disease><symptom> ( CwG). We reviewed and analyzed the medical records of 37 patients who were diagnosed as CwG at onset , followed by recurrent afebrile seizures<symptom> and followed up for at least 24 months. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 7 years ( median , 40.1 months). Three patterns of recurrent afebrile seizures<symptom> were recorded: afebrile seizures<symptom> associated with gastrointestinal<disease> infection<disease> ( AS-GI , n = 25) , afebrile seizures<symptom> associated with non-gastrointestinal infection ( AS-nGI , n = 9) , and unprovoked seizures<symptom> ( US , n = 3). Twenty eight patients ( 75.7 %) had a second episode within 6 months after the first seizures<symptom>. Five cases ( 13.5 %) suffered three episodes of afebrile seizures<symptom>. Seizure<symptom> characteristics of the three patterns were similar , manifesting as clustered seizures<symptom> in the majority. Focal epileptic activities in interictal EEG were found in 3 cases ( 9.4 %) at onset , 10 cases ( 28.6 %) at the second episode , respectively. Six patients were prescribed anti-epileptic drugs with apparently good responses. During at least 2 years ' follow-up , all the cases showed normal psychomotor development. Only one patient was diagnosed with epilepsy. All the recurrent afebrile seizures<symptom> initially diagnosed as CwG , irrespective of the kinds and frequency of relapses , showed favorable prognoses. CwG maybe falls within the category of situation-related seizures<symptom> , rather than epilepsy.
