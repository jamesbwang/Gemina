 This case report demonstrates the feasibility of using allograft bone with a resorbable collagen membrane to correct an alveolar ridge defect and achieve a highly esthetic restoration. A 30-year-old woman with generalized aggressive periodontitis<disease> and advanced periodontal vertical bone loss in periodontally hopeless upper left right premolar which required a fixed restoration. A staged surgical strategy was devised. First , a resorbable collagen membrane and allograft bone grafts were used to guide bone regeneration in the vertical alveolar defect. After 6 months , complete bone regeneration was achieved and the dental implants were submerged in the bone. Three months later , the implants were exposed and subsequently restored with a crown. The vertical guided bone regeneration strategy of using allograft bone and a resorbable collagen membrane has the potential to eliminate the need for additional procedures , which are required with non-resorbable membranes<symptom> , sinus lift procedures , and extensive block graft procedures.
