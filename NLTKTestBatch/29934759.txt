 Case reports have linked influenza<pathogen><disease> infections to the development of type 1 diabetes. We investigated whether pandemic and seasonal influenza<pathogen><disease> infections were associated with subsequent increased risk of type 1 diabetes. In this population-based registry study , we linked individual-level data from national health registries for the entire Norwegian population under the age of 30 years for the years 2006-2014 ( 2.5 million individuals). Data were obtained from the National Registry ( population data) , the Norwegian Patient Registry ( data on inpatient and outpatient specialist care) , the Primary Care Database , the Norwegian Prescription Database and the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases<disease>. Pandemic influenza<pathogen><disease> was defined as either a clinical influenza<pathogen><disease> diagnosis during the main pandemic period or a laboratory-confirmed test. Seasonal influenza<pathogen><disease> was defined by a clinical diagnosis of influenza<pathogen><disease> between 2006 and 2014. We used Cox regression to estimate HRs for new-onset type 1 diabetes after an influenza<pathogen><disease> infection , adjusted for year of birth , sex , place of birth and education. The adjusted HR for type 1 diabetes after pandemic influenza<pathogen><disease> infection was 1.19 ( 95 % CI 0.97 , 1.46). In the subgroup with laboratory-confirmed influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>) , influenza<pathogen><disease> was associated with a twofold higher risk of subsequent type 1 diabetes before age 30 years ( adjusted HR: 2.26 , 95 % CI 1.51 , 3.38). Overall , we could not demonstrate a clear association between clinically reported pandemic influenza<pathogen><disease> infection and incident type 1 diabetes. However , we found a twofold excess<symptom> of incident diabetes in the subgroup with laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> ( H1N1<pathogen>).
