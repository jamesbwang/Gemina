 Hypogonadism is highly prevalent among obese men with metabolic syndrome<symptom>. Chronic low-grade inflammation<symptom> is suspected to be a major cause for low testosterone levels in obese individuals. To test the inflammatory hypothesis of testosterone deficiency in metabolic syndrome<symptom>. In this randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial involving men with metabolic syndrome<symptom> , we randomly assigned 33 patients to receive 100 mg of anakinra ( recombinant human interleukin-1-receptor antagonist) subcutaneously twice daily for 4 weeks and 34 patients to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total testosterone levels after 4 weeks. The mean age was 54 years and baseline total testosterone levels were 9.3 nmol/L ( 95 % CI , 8.7-10.0). At 4 weeks , total testosterone levels increased by 1.2 nmol/L ( 95 % CI , 0.3-2.0; P = 0.01) in the anakinra group as compared to no change in the placebo group ( 0.01 nmol/L; 95 % CI , ( -0.5) -0.5; P = 0.99) , resulting in a between-group difference of 0.96 nmol/L ( 95 % CI , 0.3-1.9; P = 0.04). The effects were most pronounced with baseline c-reactive protein > 2 mg/L ( between-group-difference 2.14 nmol/L; 95 % CI , 0.11-4.17; P = 0.04) and body mass index > 40 kg/m2 ( between-group-difference 2.64 nmol/L; 95 % CI , 0.19-5.09; P = 0.04). Anakinra treatment did not exert benefits on fatigue<symptom> and sexual dysfunction , but improved grip strength of non-dominant hand by 3.5 kg ( 95 % CI 0.23-6.81; P = 0.04) and reduced mean arterial blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> by 2.9 mmHg ( 95 % CI , ( -5.99) -0.19; P = 0.07). Antiinflammatory treatment with an antagonist of Interleukin-1 led to a modest increase in testosterone levels in obese men with testosterone deficiency.
