Immune response related with skin thermal pattern in judokas: A new application for infrared thermography? J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study investigated the association between body<symptom> skin temperature ( BST) and immune response after judo training , and compared the immune responses considering 2 post-training skin thermal pattern ( `` spots ''- SPT and `` localized ''- LOC). For this , we evaluated 32 ( 25-male) black-belt judokas from the Spanish Junior National Team ( 18.0 ± 3.5 years , 72.4 ± 18.4 kg , and 17.1 ± 7.5 % body fat). White<symptom> blood cell and BST measurements were performed at pre-training , immediately , 1 , and 24-hour post-training. Body<symptom> skin temperature ( ° C) was estimated by skin temperature from 4 regions of interest ( chest , upper arm , thigh , and calf). The main results indicated that 13 judokas were classified as SPT and 19 as LOC. In comparison with LOC , SPT had a significantly lower BST post-training ( SPT = 33.0 ± 0.4 vs. LOC = 33.6 ± 0.8 ° C; p = 0.016) , lower blood concentration of leukocytes ( SPT = 7.9 ± 1.9 vs. LOC = 8.9 ± 1.9 cells × 10 per mm; p ≤ 0.001) , and neutrophils ( SPT = 5.5 ± 1.7 vs. LOC = 6.1 ± 2.2 cells × 10 per mm; p ≤ 0.001). In conclusion , the BST and immune response after judo training seem to be not associated. However , when the skin thermal pattern is considered , the SPT skin thermal pattern presented a lower post-training BST , blood leukocytes , and neutrophils in comparison with the LOC group. These results show a possible relationship between skin thermal pattern and immune responses for the first time; however , further studies are needed to confirm the evidence presented here.
