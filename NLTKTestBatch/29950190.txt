 The long-term outcomes of bipolar disorder range from lasting remission to chronic course or frequent recurrences requiring admissions. The distinction between bipolar I and II disorders has limited utility in outcome prediction. It is unclear to what extent the clinical course of bipolar disorder predicts long-term outcomes. A representative sample of 191 individuals diagnosed with bipolar I or II disorder was recruited and followed for up to 5 years using a life-chart method. We previously described the clinical course over the first 18 months with dimensional course characteristics and latent classes. Now we test if these course characteristics predict long-term outcomes , including time ill ( time with any mood symptoms<symptom>) and hospital admissions over a second non-overlapping follow-up period in 111 individuals with available data from both 18 months and 5 years follow-ups. Dimensional course characteristics from the first 18 months prospectively predicted outcomes over the following 3.5 years. The proportion of time depressed , the severity of depressive symptoms<symptom> and the proportion of time manic predicted more time ill. The proportion of time manic , the severity of manic symptoms<symptom> and depression-to-mania switching predicted a greater likelihood of hospital admissions. All predictions remained significant after controlling for age , sex and bipolar I v. II disorder. Differential associations with long-term outcomes suggest that course characteristics may facilitate care planning with greater predictive validity than established types of bipolar disorders. A clinical course dominated by depressive symptoms<symptom> predicts a greater proportion of time ill. A clinical course characterized by manic episodes predicts hospital admissions.
