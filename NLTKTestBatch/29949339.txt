 The importation of construction principles or even constituents from biology into materials science is a prevailing concept. Vice versa , the cellular level modification of living systems with nonnatural components is much more difficult to achieve. It has been done for analytical purposes , for example , imaging , to learn something about intracellular processes. Cases describing the improvement of a biological function by the integration of a nonnatural ( nano) constituent are extremely rare. Because biological membranes<symptom> contain some kind of a surfactant , for example , phospholipids , our idea is to modify cells with a newly synthesized surfactant. However , this surfactant is intended to possess an additional functionality , which is the reduction of oxidative stress. We report the synthesis of a surfactant with Janus-type head<disease> group architecture , a fullerene C
