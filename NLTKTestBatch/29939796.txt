 Time reference , which has been found to be selectively impaired in agrammatic aphasia<symptom> , is often interwoven with grammatical aspect. A recent study on Russian aphasia<symptom> found that time reference and aspect interact: Past reference was less impaired when tested within a perfective aspect context ( compared to when tested within an imperfective aspect context) , and reference to the non-past was less impaired when tested within an imperfective aspect context ( compared to when tested within a perfective aspect context). To explain this pattern , the authors argued that there are prototypical associations between time frames and aspectual values. The present study explores the relationship between time reference and aspect focusing on Greek aphasia<symptom> and healthy ageing and using a sentence completion task that crosses time reference and aspect. The findings do not support prototypical matches between different time frames and aspectual values. Building on relevant studies , we propose that patterns of performance of healthy or language-impaired speakers on constrained tasks tapping different combinations of time frames with aspectual values should reflect the relative frequency of these combinations in a given language. The analysis of the results at the individual level revealed a double dissociation , which indicates that a given time frame-aspectual value combination may be relatively easy to process for some persons with aphasia<symptom> but demanding for some others.
