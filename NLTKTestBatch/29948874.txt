 Obesity among human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>)- infected individuals is on the rise. Bariatric procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy ( SG) alter the GI tract<symptom>. Whether this alteration has any impact on the absorption of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART) , thus affecting HIV<pathogen> disease<disease> markers such as CD4 cell count or viral load ( VL) , is not yet known. We conducted this review to look into the outcomes of bariatric surgery procedures , RYGB , SG and adjustable gastric band ( AGB) and its effects on the CD4 cell counts and VL and HAART therapy. A literature search was conducted between January and April 2017 , by two independent reviewers , using Pubmed and Google Scholar. The terms ` bariatric surgery and HIV<pathogen> ' , ` obesity surgery and HIV<pathogen> ' , ` gastric bypass surgery and HIV<pathogen> ' , ` sleeve gastrectomy and HIV<pathogen> ' and ` gastric band and HIV<pathogen> ' were used to retrieve available research. Of the 49 papers reviewed , only 12 reported the outcomes of patients with HIV<pathogen> undergoing bariatric surgery and were therefore included in this review. Six papers assessed patients undergoing RYGB only ( N = 18) , 3 papers reported on SG only ( N = 18) and 3 papers reported on case mix , including 7 cases of RYGB , 4 cases of SG and 11 cases of AGB. Data is limited; however , based on the available data , bariatric surgery is safe in HIV-infected individuals and does not have any adverse impact on HIV<pathogen> disease<disease> progress. Additionally , there was no difference in HIV-related outcomes between SG and RYGB.
