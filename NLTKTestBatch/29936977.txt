 The association between regional breast cancer diagnostic rates , treatments , and outcomes is unclear. We sought to investigate the management and survival of women with invasive ductal carcinoma ( IDC) from geographic regions with variable rates of diagnosis. Data on women diagnosed with IDC years 2009-2010 were obtained from the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results database. Patients were divided into quartiles based on the IDC diagnostic rate within their county of residence. Chi-square and one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) analyses tested the association between patient and clinical characteristics and the diagnostic rate quartiles. Cox regression analyses compared survival between the quartiles. Among the 83,375 patients included , the mean age was 60.8 y and 70.9 % were white. Patients residing in counties with the highest diagnostic rates were more frequently white , employed , educated , and wealthier and more often received adjuvant radiation following both partial mastectomy for localized disease<disease> and complete mastectomy for advanced disease<disease> compared to patients in counties with the lowest diagnostic rates. The highest diagnostic rate quartile had 10 % decreased odds of death compared to the lower quartile ( hazard ratio: 0.897; 95 % confidence interval: 0.832-0.966). However , after adjustment for socioeconomic variables , survival was comparable ( hazard ratio: 0.916; 95 % confidence interval: 0.835-1.003). Regional variation in IDC diagnostic rates is associated with differences in socioeconomic status<symptom> , grade , stage , and treatment. Patients from regions with the highest rates of diagnosis may have improved access to evidence-based care and resultant superior survival. Enhancing access to care may improve outcomes of patients residing in regions where breast cancer is diagnosed less frequently.
