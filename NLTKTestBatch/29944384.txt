 Individuals diagnosed with cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) as adults represent a growing sub-population of CF cases but there are limited studies describing their characteristics and prognosis. The objectives of this study were to describe the clinical characteristics , estimate survival , and identify clinical predictors of reduced survival at baseline in individuals with adult-diagnosed CF. The Canadian CF Patient Registry was utilized to identify CF patients that were â‰¥ 18 years of age at diagnosis and newly diagnosed between 1990 and 2014. Clinical characteristics were described and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate lung transplant-free survival. Multivariable Cox regression analysis and adjusted survival curves were employed to identify important predictors of reduced survival at the time of diagnosis ( i.e. baseline) and to produce adjusted effects. 362 adults were diagnosed with CF during the study period. The median follow-up time was 7.7 years and 48 individuals experienced an event ( 15 transplants , 33 deaths without transplant). The median age at diagnosis was 34.3 years with the majority of individuals presenting with pulmonary and/or gastrointestinal symptoms<symptom> ( 71 %). Lung transplant-free survival was 88 % at 10 years and 86 % at 15 years. Age at diagnosis ( HR: 1.24 per 5-year increase , 95 % CI: 1.09-1.43) , diabetes ( HR: 4.19 , 95 % CI: 1.35-13.01) , and lung function ( HR: 1.35 per 5 % decrease in FEV1 % predicted , 95 % CI: 1.24-1.48) at baseline were important predictors of reduced survival. CF care providers can use this information to inform individuals diagnosed with CF as adults about their prognosis and to guide the necessity of treatments , specifically for those who are at high-risk for a worse prognosis.
