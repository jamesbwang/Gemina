 Relatively little research has been conducted that can reliably be used by psychiatrists , psychologists and general practitioners to estimate the recovery time of their patients suffering from depression<symptom>. The treatment guideline for depression<symptom> submits that half of those with mdd will recover within three months. <br /> AIM: To present the findings from nemesis-2 ( the Netherlands Mental<symptom> Health Survey and Incidence Study-2) on both the duration of depressive episodes in the general population and associated risk indicators. <br /> METHOD: The respondents that had developed a depressive episode between the first two follow-up assessments were selected; 286 with a clinical depression<symptom> according to dsm-iv criteria ( mdd) and 107 with a subclinical depression<symptom> ( MinDD). The episode duration was assessed with the Life Chart Interview. <br /> RESULTS: Half of the patients with mdd recovered within 6 months and 12 % had not recovered after 3 years. The mean duration for mdd was 10.7 months. Better physical and mental health before depression<symptom> onset predicted shorter duration. Longer duration was associated with comorbid dysthymia or anxiety<symptom> disorder. In comparison , the median duration of MinDD was half the length of mdd ( 3 months) , whereas the mean duration ( 8.7 months) , the percentage that had not recovered after 3 years ( 10 %) and risk indicators for episode duration hardly differed. <br /> CONCLUSION: In the guideline for depression<symptom> it is assumed that half of those with mdd will recover within three months. Our study , however , found the median duration of mdd to be twice as long. Consequently , only a short period without active treatment can be justified. This paper also concludes that MinDD can not be regarded as a transient , self-limiting mood state.
