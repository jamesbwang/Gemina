 Oxygen saturation targets in premature infants have been investigated in multiple international randomized controlled trials. Some trials have shown increased mortality with targeting lower ( 85 % to 89 %) compared to higher ( 91 % to 95 %) oxygen saturation ranges , while others have not. We will review the mortality outcomes of the largest multi-centered trials and a post hoc study that observed increased mortality at lower target ranges among small for gestational age infants. The planned Neonatal Oxygen Prospective Meta-analysis ( NeOProM) collaborative will hopefully provide further insight into patient-specific risks , which include growth status<symptom>.
