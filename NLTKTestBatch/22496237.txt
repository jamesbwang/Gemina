 Immune exhaustion<symptom> is an important feature of chronic<disease> infections<disease> , such as HIV<pathogen> , and a barrier to effective immunity against cancer. This dysfunction is in part controlled by inhibitory immune checkpoints. Blockade of the PD-1 or IL-10 pathways can reinvigorate HIV-specific CD4 T cell function in vitro , as measured by cytokine secretion and proliferative responses upon Ag stimulation. However , whether this restoration of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can improve help to other cell subsets impaired in HIV<pathogen> infection remains to be determined. In this study , we examine a cohort of chronically infected subjects prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy ( ART) and individuals with suppressed viral load on ART. We show that IFN-Î³ induction in NK cells upon PBMC stimulation by HIV<pathogen> Ag varies inversely with viremia and depends on HIV-specific CD4 T cell help. We demonstrate in both untreated and ART-suppressed individuals that dual PD-1 and IL-10 blockade enhances cytokine secretion of NK cells via restored HIV-specific CD4 T cell function , that soluble factors contribute to these immunotherapeutic effects , and that they depend on IL-2 and IL-12 signaling. Importantly , we show that inhibition of the PD-1 and IL-10 pathways also increases NK degranulation and killing of target cells. This study demonstrates a previously underappreciated relationship between CD4 T cell impairment and NK cell exhaustion<symptom> in HIV<pathogen> infection , provides a proof of principle that reversal of adaptive immunity exhaustion<symptom> can improve the innate immune response , and suggests that immune checkpoint modulation that improves CD4/NK cell cooperation can be used as adjuvant therapy in HIV<pathogen> infection.
