 Classical swine fever<symptom> ( CSF) is one of the most devastating and highly contagious viral<disease> diseases<disease> in the world. Since late 2014 , outbreaks of a new sub-genotype 2.1 d CSF virus<pathogen> ( CSFV) had caused substantial economic losses<symptom> in numbers of C-strain vaccinated swine farms in China. The objective of the present study was to explore the genomic characteristics and pathogenicity of the newly emerged CSFV isolates in China during 2014-2015. All the new 8 CSFV isolates belonged to genetic sub-genotype 2.1 d. Some genomic variations or deletions were found in the UTRs and E2 of these new isolates. In addition , the pathogenicity of HLJ1 was less than Shimen , suggesting the HLJ1 of sub-genotype 2.1 d may be a moderated pathogenic isolate and the C-strain vaccine can supply complete protection. The new CSFV isolates with unique genomic characteristics and moderate pathogenicity can be epidemic in many large-scale C-strain vaccinated swine farms. This study provides the information should be merited special attention on establishing prevention and control policies for CSF.
