 We performed this study to compare the sensitivity and specificity of multi-slice computed tomography ( MSCT) to coronary angiography ( CA) in detecting coronary total occlusion ( CTO) lesion<symptom> characteristics. Moreover , we analyzed the association between these characteristics and the risk of revascularization failure. Fifty patients with confirmed CTO diagnosis were tried for revascularization using the antegrade ( all 50) or retrograde ( in failed nine antegrade interventions) approaches. Each patient underwent CA and MSCT before the intervention and data from both modalities were compared using the SPSS software. Successful revascularization occurred in 36 ( 72 %) and 6 ( 66.7 %) patients of the antegrade and retrograde groups , respectively. Compared to CA , MSCT exhibited high sensitivity in detecting CTO segment calcification ( 100 %) , size of the affected vessel ( 100 % , area under the curve ( AUC) = 0.82) , distal filling of the affected segment ( 97.7 %) and side-branching at the CTO segment ( 93.3 %). However , it had lower sensitivity in detecting collaterals ( 75 %) and the length of the affected segment ( 87.5 % , AUC = 0.77). According to MSCT data , increased occlusion length > 18 mm ( p = 0.01) , atherosclerotic vessel wall ( p = 0.02) , small distal vessel size â‰¤ 2.75 mm ( p = 0.002) , proximal side-branching ( p = 0.01) and calcification of the proximal cap ( p = 0.007) or distal stump ( p = 0.01) were associated with an increased risk of revascularization failure. MSCT exhibited high sensitivity in identifying several CTO lesion<symptom> characteristics , such as lesional calcification and size of the affected vessel. However , further research is needed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of this modality and define the predictors of revascularization failure in CTO patients.
