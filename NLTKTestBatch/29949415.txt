 In this article , we review the literature on PET/CT in the management of dementia , present evidence for best clinical practices , and discuss recent advances in the field. Standard-of-care imaging for dementia includes CT and MRI , primarily for excluding vascular lesions<symptom> or masses , detecting atrophy , and monitoring disease<disease> severity. PET/CT is a powerful functional modality that can differentiate dementia types and influence management. Fluorine-18-FDG PET/CT reveals the spatial pattern of glucose metabolism in the brain. More recently , radiotracers for PET have been developed that bind to amyloid protein , tau protein , and neuroinflammatory markers.
