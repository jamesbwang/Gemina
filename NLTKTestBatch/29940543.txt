 The relationship between higher body mass index ( BMI) , decreased morbidity and mortality is known as the `` obesity paradox '' , and has been described in cohorts of patients with hypertension , diabetes , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , coronary and peripheral artery diseases<disease> , non-cardiac surgery , and end-stage renal disease<disease>. Here we investigated the relationship between BMI and short-term outcomes after adult cardiac surgery to explore the existence of an obesity paradoxical effect. A secondary objective was to perform an updated systematic review to further analyze the association between BMI and 30-day in-hospital mortality after cardiac surgery. A retrospective analysis was performed from a consecutive series of 1823 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery , that were assigned to five BMI groups: normal weight ( 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) , overweight ( 25-29.9 kg/m2) , class I obese ( 30-34.9 kg/m2) , class II obese ( 35-39.9 kg/m2) , and class III obese or morbidly obese ( 40-49.9 kg/m2). A systematic review search was performed including controlled trials and observational studies identified in MEDLINE , Embase , SCOPUS , and the Cochrane library ( to the end of June 2017). In the present series , overweight and obese patients had similar or slightly lower in-hospital mortality rates after cardiac surgery compared with normal-weight individuals. Conversely , postoperative complication rates increased with higher BMI levels. Most studies included in the review showed that overweight and obese patients had at least the same mortality rate as normal-weight patients , or even a lower death risk. Pooled-data of the meta-analysis provided evidence on the association between higher BMI levels and a lower all-cause in-hospital mortality rate after cardiac surgery.
