 For the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis<disease> ( SBP) in cirrhotic patients with ascites , norfloxacin 400 mg per day is recommended as a standard regimen. This study aims to investigate whether ciprofloxacin once weekly administration is not inferior to norfloxacin once daily administration for the prevention of SBP. This is an investigator-initiated open-label randomized controlled trial conducted at seven tertiary hospitals in South Korea. Liver cirrhosis patients with ascites were screened , and enrolled in this randomized controlled trial if ascitic protein â‰¤ 1.5 g/dL or the presence of history of SBP. Ascitic polymorphonucleated cell count needed to be < 250/mm One hundred twenty-four patients met enrollment criteria and were assigned into each group by 1:1 ratio ( 62:62). Seven patients in the norfloxacin group and five patients in the ciprofloxacin group were lost to follow-up. SBP developed in four patients ( 4/55) and in three patients ( 3/57) in each group , respectively ( 7.3 % vs. 5.3 % , P = 0.712). The transplant-free survival rates at 1 year were comparable between the groups ( 72.7 % vs. 73.7 % , P = 0.970). Incidence of infectious complication , hepatorenal syndrome<symptom> , hepatic encephalopathy , and variceal bleeding rates were not significantly different ( all P = ns). The factors related to survival were models representing underlying liver function. Once weekly ciprofloxacin was as effective as daily norfloxacin for the prevention of SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
