 The mechanisms explaining the positive relationship between television ( TV) viewing and body mass index ( BMI) are unclear. ` Mindless eating ' and ` physical activity displacement ' theories have been suggested , but have not been tested longitudinally among young adults. This study aimed to determine whether longitudinal associations between young adults ' TV viewing and BMI are explained by changes in TV-related food and beverage consumption ( FBC) and/or leisure-time physical activity ( LTPA) over 5 years among young adults. A cohort of young Australian adults ( n = 1068) was assessed in 2004-6 ( T1) and 2009-2011 ( T2) , height and weight<symptom> were measured ( T1) or self-reported ( T2) , and participants self-reported TV viewing time ( hours/day) , weekly TV-related FBC and LTPA ( mins/week). Linear regression was used to examine direct pathways between TV viewing and BMI , adjusting for TV-related FBC and LTPA to examine indirect pathways. The association between TV viewing time and BMI ( β: 0.41 , 95 % CI 0.03 , 0.78 for > 1-h increase in TV viewing/day) was not explained by TV-related FBC ( β: 0.37 , 95 % CI -0.18 , 0.91) or LTPA ( β: 0.38 , 95 % CI -0.17 , 0.93) hypotheses. Increased TV-related FBC was associated with increased TV viewing ( 0.39 ± 1.54 h/day) and greater increases in BMI ( 0.92 ± 2.28 kg/m Factors other than changes in TV-related FBC or LTPA may explain the longitudinal relationship between TV viewing and increasing BMI among young adults. Findings confirm that TV viewing is a risk factor for weight<symptom> gain in young adults but the underlying causal mechanisms remain unclear.
