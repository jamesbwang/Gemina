 Resistant hypertension is defined by the inability to maintain within normal limits the blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> values of an individual , while he is under treatment with maximal tolerated doses of three antihypertensive agents. One of the most common types of resistant hypertension is renovascular hypertension ( RVH) , which is caused by the narrowing of the renal arteries , in the context of existing atherosclerotic plaques at that level. We are presenting the case of a hypertensive 56-year-old man admitted in the Clinic of Cardiology for a sudden rise of his blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> values , despite undergoing the scheduled treatment. The abdominal bruit discovered at the clinical examination and the hypokalemia , together with the mild impairment of the renal function raised the suspicion of an existing stenosis of the main renal<symptom> blood vessels. Simple grey scale kidney ultrasound , Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries , abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography of the renal arteries , along with invasive renal angiography demonstrated a smaller right kidney , adrenal incidentalomas , reduced vascular diameter of renal arteries due to atheromatous lesions<symptom> , thrombosis of the infrarenal segment of the abdominal aorta , and reduced vascular hemodynamics in the same territories. After the renal arteries revascularization and with minimal antihypertensive treatment , the patient had a favorable outcome , with normalization of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and renal function. Atherosclerotic disease<disease> causing renal artery stenosis is essential to be taken into consideration in the etiopathogenesis of resistant hypertension especially because RVH is a potentially curable disease<disease>.
