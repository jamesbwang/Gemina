 Assisted reproductive technology ( ART) has been associated with low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight<symptom> of fresh embryo transfer ( FRESH) derived and increased birth weight<symptom> of frozen embryo transfer ( FET)- derived newborns. Owing to that , we focused on imprinted insulin-like growth factor 2 ( A consistent trend of genotype-specific decreased methylation level was observed in paternal allele of rs10732516 paternal A/maternal G genotype , but not in paternal G/maternal A genotype , at The observed DNA methylation changes together with the phenotypic findings suggest that rs10732516 polymorphism associates with the effects of ART in a parent-of-origin manner. Therefore , this polymorphism should be considered when the effects of environmental factors on embryonic development are studied.
