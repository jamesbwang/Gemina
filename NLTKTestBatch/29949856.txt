 Despite the importance of vitamin D in early stages of life , data are lacking on the levels of vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25- ( OH) D) among Chinese school-age children. The aims of this study were to investigate the vitamin D intake and serum 25- ( OH) D concentration of children aged 7 to 12 years in China , and to measure the associations between vitamin D status<symptom> and children & rsquo; s growth and development parameters. We obtained data on vitamin D intake , serum 25- ( OH) D concentration , and anthropometric measurements from a cross-sectional study on school-aged children in China. Multiple linear regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed the associations mentioned above. A total of 563 children ( 9.5 Â± 1.6 years) from six areas of China were included. Among them , 86.1 % had a vitamin D intake below the recommended nutrient intake ( 10 & mu; g/day) , and 54.7 % had vitamin D deficiency ( serum 25- ( OH) D < 15 ng/mL). We also found that high vitamin D intake was inversely associated with the risk of vitamin D deficiency ( OR = 0.836 , 95 % confidence interval: 0.713 , 0.980) , and serum 25- ( OH) D concentration was positively associated with the intelligence score and body mass index-for-age
