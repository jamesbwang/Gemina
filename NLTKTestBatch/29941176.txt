 Human maternal placentophagy , the behavior of ingesting the own raw or processed placenta postpartum , is a growing trend by women of western societies. This study aims to identify the impact of dehydration<symptom> and steaming on hormone and trace element concentration as well as microbial contamination of placental tissue. A total of nine placentas have been processed: six were studied for hormone and trace element concentrations; eight were studied for microbial contamination. The concentrations of CRH , hPL , oxytocin and ACTH in samples of raw , steamed dehydrated and raw dehydrated placental tissue were detected using ELISA. A yeast bioassay was performed in order to detect estrogen equivalent ( EEQ) and gestagen equivalent ( PEQ) active substances. Elements ( As , Cd , Fe , Pb , Se , Hg) were analyzed using ICP-MS. Isolated colonies from tissue and placenta swab samples were identified using Vitek MS. Following mean hormone concentrations were detected in raw placental tissue: CRH ( 177.88 ng/g) , hPL ( 17.99 mg/g) , oxytocin ( 85.10 pg/g) , ACTH ( 2.07 ng/g) , estrogen equivalent active substances ( 46.95 ng/g) and gestagen equivalent active substances ( 2.12 Î¼g/g). All hormones were sensitive to processing with a significant concentration reduction through steaming and dehydration<symptom>. Microorganisms mainly from the vaginal flora were detected on placenta swab samples and samples from raw , steamed , dehydrated and steamed dehydrated tissue and mostly disappeared after dehydration<symptom>. According to regulations of the European Union the concentrations of potentially toxic elements ( As , Cd , Hg , Pb) were below the toxicity threshold for foodstuffs. The commonly used protocols for preparation of placenta for its individual oral ingestion reduce hormone concentrations and bacterial contamination.
