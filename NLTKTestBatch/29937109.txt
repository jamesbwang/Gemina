 Obesity is a major public health problem. Pregnant women are also affected by this epidemic. In pregnant women , obesity increases obstetric and neonatal complications , and is associated with alterations in the quality of labor that could be explained by reduced myometrial contractility. This leads to an increase in the rate of caesarean sections and postpartum haemorrhages in this population at risk. Adipokines , hormones secreted by adipose tissue , may have a role in altering the myometrial contractility. Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> in these patients is based on dietary management and on physical activity , which could be a way to improve adipokines action and uterine contractility. The objective of this literature review was to review current knowledge about the role of adipokines on uterine contractility in obese pregnant women and to assess the interest of sport in improving contractility and in reducing obstetric complications in these women.
