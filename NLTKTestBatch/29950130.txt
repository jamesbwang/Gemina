 Previous studies indicated that gestational weight<symptom> gain-related disorders share many similarities with feeding and eating disorders. To examine the association of prepregnancy Body Mass Index ( BMI) , defined according to 2009 Institute of Medicine ( IOM) , and its shift across gestation with symptoms<symptom> of feeding and eating disorders , defined by EDE-Q ( Fairburn & Beglin , 2008). This prospective cohort study took place at the Division of Perinatal Medicine of Policlinico Abano Terme , Italy , from Jannuary 2015 to October 2015. the sample included 655 healthy at term puerperae. We correlated gestational BMI in different women categories to EDE-Q Global score and Restrain , Eating concern , Shape concern , and Weight<symptom> concern subscales , by Spearman 's correlation test. Among 655 women , 59 ( 9.0 %) were categorized as underweight , 463 ( 70.7 %) normal weight<symptom> , 98 ( 15.0 %) overweight , and 35 ( 5.3 %) as obese in prepregnancy period. At the end of gestation , underweight women category disappeared , normal weight<symptom> women lightened to one third , overweight women tripled , and obese women doubled. At the same time , EDE-Q global scores increased from normal weight<symptom> ( 0.25 ± 0.41) , to overweigh ( 0.47 ± 0.58) , and to obese ( 0.72 ± 0.70) puerperae. In addition , EDE-Q global scores were significantly correlated with gestational BMI increase in Global score ( rho = 0.326; p < 0.001) and in the four subscales: restrain ( rho = 0.161; p < 0.001) , Eating concern ( rho = 0.193; p < 0.001) , Shape concern ( rho = 0.335; p < 0.001) , and Weight<symptom> concern ( rho = 0.365; p < 0.001) , respectively. It was found that the shift of woman BMI across an uncomplicated pregnancy is a warning indicator of unhealthy eating and feeding symptoms<symptom>.
