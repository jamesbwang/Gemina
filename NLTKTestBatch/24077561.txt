 Inflammation<symptom> is a characteristic feature of Parkinson 's disease<disease> ( PD). We examined the role of TLR9 and its regulation by glucocorticoid receptors ( GRs) in degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine neurons ( DNs). TLR9 agonist , CpG-ODN , induced DN degeneration in mice lacking GR in microglia but not in controls. TLR9 deletion reduced DN loss in neurotoxin , 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP) mouse model of PD. GR regulates TLR9 activation during MPTP neurotoxicity as TLR9 antagonist suppressed increased DN loss in microglia/macrophage GR mutant mice. GR absence in microglia enhanced TLR9 translocation to endolysosomes and facilitated its cleavage leading to pro-inflammatory gene expression. GR-dependent TLR9 activation also triggered DN loss following intranigral injection of mitochondrial DNA. Finally , microglial GR sensitivity to A53T-alpha-synuclein induced DN degeneration as well as decreased microglial GR expression observed in SN of PD brain samples , all suggest that reduced microglial GR activity in SN can stimulate TLR9 activation and DN loss in PD pathology.
