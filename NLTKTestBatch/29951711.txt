 To investigate the association between iron supplementation during early pregnancy and the presence of de novo hypertension after 20 weeks ' gestation ( either gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia). Retrospective cohort study. This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of non-anemic pregnant women who received first antenatal care at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital , Navamindradhiraj University , Bangkok , Thailand , during the June 2009-December 2010 study period. All included women had blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and urine albumin level data that were recorded at each antenatal visit. The study population was divided into one of the two following groups: iron supplementation starting at gestational age ( GA) < 16 weeks ( study group) or GA â‰¥ 16 weeks ( control group). A comparison of the proportion of de novo hypertension arising after 20 weeks ' gestation was then performed between groups. Four hundred non-anemic pregnant women were included , with 200 patients allocated to each groups. The overall incidence of de novo hypertension after 20 weeks ' gestation was 10 % ( 40/400) , with significantly higher prevalence in the study group than that in the control group ( 13.5 % ( 27/200) vs. 6.5 % ( 13/200); relative risk: 2.14 , 95 % , CI 1.22-3.73; p = 0.008). None of the women in this study developed anemia<symptom> at time of delivery. There was no significant difference between groups for GA at delivery , birth weight<symptom> , or birth asphyxia. In our study population , iron supplementation before 16 weeks ' GA was significantly associated with increased risk of developing de novo hypertension after 20 weeks ' gestation.
