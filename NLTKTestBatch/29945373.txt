 In order to explore appropriate measures to promote germination after the harvest of Epimedium pseudowushanense , 6-BA , urea , ammonium bicarbonate and GA ₃ were chosen to spray on the root and rhizomes , and then the biological indicators such as branches , leaf length , leaf width , plant height and so on , were measured in different periods , and the contents of epimedin A , epimedin B , epimedin C and icariin in the dry leaves were detected by HPLC. Results showed that 6-BA 90 mg · L ⁻¹ ( B1) , 6-BA 60 mg · L ⁻¹ ( B2) ,6-BA 30 mg · L ⁻¹ + urea 300 mg · L ⁻¹ ( C1) , 6-BA 60 mg · L ⁻¹ + urea 300 mg · L ⁻¹ ( C2) ,6-BA 60 mg · L ⁻¹ + ammonium bicarbonate 300 mg · L ⁻¹ ( C4) significantly increased bud germination in the early period , and the plants quickly set up new system of photosynthesis , the branches in a month of which were higher than the control group respectively by 165.9 % , 115.76 % , 103.86 % , 104.50 % , 81.67 %. However the branches developed the next year and the dry<symptom> weight<symptom> of leaves per plant in group B1 and B2 were much lower than that in control group. The groups that use 6-BA and nitrogen at the same time reaped a good yield of leaves even though the treatment had no significant influence on the branches developed the next year. The dry<symptom> weight<symptom> of leaves of C1 , C2 , C4 treatments were 36.80 % , 32.84 % , 45.97 % more than the control group respectively. Therefore , C1 , C2 and C4 treatments are the more appropriate to promote recovery after harvest. Furthermore , different groups , except 10 mg · L ⁻¹ 6-BA treatment significantly reduced the content of epimedin C , other groups did n't have any significant effect on the contents of such flavonoids.
