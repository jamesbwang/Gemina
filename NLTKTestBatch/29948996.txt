 Avian eggshell membranes<symptom> are good candidates as a matrix for immobilization procedures. Chicken eggshell , a waste material available from the poultry industry as a byproduct , is a very safe and cheap raw material. While pieces of eggshell membrane , or even particles from whole eggshell , have been previously used for these purposes , we report here the use of eggshell membrane powder for E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> Î²-galactosidase immobilization with glutaraldehyde as cross-linker. A kinetic characterization is provided for eggshell membrane powder-bound enzyme compared to free enzyme. Results show a remarkable similarity between bound and free enzyme and also that the immobilized enzyme is stable and can be reused several times. Moreover , bound enzyme is able to produce glucose from skim milk serum.
