 Epstein-Barr<disease> virus<pathogen> ( EBV)- positive gastric cancers represent a distinct subtype of gastric cancers and account for nearly 10 % of the gastric cancer burden , yet risk detection strategies for this cancer subtype are lacking. We conducted a nested case-control study where we assayed 4 EBV antigens ( viral capsid antigen ( VCA) , early antigen ( EA) , Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen ( EBNA) , and BZLF1-encoded replication activator protein ( ZEBRA)) in either sera or plasma from 1447 gastric cancer cases and 1797 controls obtained from seven prospective cohorts representing individuals from the high gastric cancer-risk countries of China , Japan , and Korea. The prevalence of EBV sero-positivity was universal with the exception of one sero-negative individual , and the highest titers of the EBV antigens VCA ( OR 0.95 , 95 % CI 0.78-1.17) , EBNA ( OR 0.88 , 95 % CI 0.72-1.08) , EA ( OR 0.97 , 95 % CI 0.79-1.19) , and ZEBRA ( OR 0.87 , 95 % CI 0.71-1.07) were not associated with risk of incident gastric cancer. When we stratified these data by H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> status<symptom> , there was no change in the association. Multiplex serology of the aforementioned EBV antigens in serum may not be a suitable biomarker for predicting gastric cancer risk in East Asian populations.
