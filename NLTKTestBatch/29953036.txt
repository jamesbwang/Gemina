 Patients with overlapping Miller Fisher syndrome<symptom> ( MFS) , Guillain-Barr√© syndrome<symptom> ( GBS) , and the Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis<disease> ( BBE) have rarely been reported , and the diverse clinical features and sequelae are challenging for physicians. Through this case report , we present the clinical course , treatment , recovery , and sequelae of an overlapping MFS , GBS , and BBE syndrome<symptom> and provide a review of the literature. A 76-year-old woman was initially presented with diplopia<symptom> , ophthalmoplegia<symptom> , and ataxia<symptom> , but she later developed weakness<symptom> of limbs , respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> , deterioration of consciousness<symptom> , and cognitive impairment. After IV immunoglobulin and corticosteroid therapy , she began to recover consciousness<symptom> and from the weakness<symptom> from day 18. After 8 months of rehabilitative therapy , she was able to swallow food without difficulty , but she still can not walk without assistance , showed cognitive impairment , and the tracheostomy remained in place because of persistent respiratory<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom>. As the clinical course of MFS-GBS-BBE overlapping syndrome<symptom> is variable , involving not only the peripheral but also the central nervous system , the establishment of a comprehensive therapeutic strategy is warranted.
