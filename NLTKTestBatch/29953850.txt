 There seems to be a clear correlation between antibodies against domain I ( anti-DI) of β2Glycoprotein I and severe clinical profiles in antiphospholipid syndrome<symptom> ( APS) patients. We investigated the clinical significance of anti-DI antibodies in a cohort of aPL carriers. One hundred and five carriers persistently positive for IgG anti-β2Glycoprotein 1 antibodies ( a-β2GPI) and/or IgG anticardiolipin ( aCL) and/or lupus anticoagulants ( LAC) were tested for the presence of anti-DI antibodies using the QUANTA Flash ® Beta2GPI-Domain I chemiluminescence immunoassay. Anti-DI antibodies were detected in 44 aPL carriers ( 41.9 %) and they were significantly associated to triple aPL positivity ( LAC plus IgG a-β2GPI plus IgG aCL antibodies). Isolated LAC and a-β2GPI antibodies were significantly associated to anti-DI negative aPL carriers. During a 82.2 month mean follow-up , ten aPL carriers ( 9.5 %) developed a first thrombotic event so becoming APS patients. Anti-DI antibodies , triple aPL positivity , thromboembolic risk factors and autoimmune disorders significantly prevailed in carriers becoming APS. Logistic regression analysis showed that anti-DI positivity was an independent risk factor for thrombosis. Anti-DI antibody positivity can be considered a new risk factor predictive of the first thrombotic event in aPL carriers , instead , negative anti-DI may be useful to identify low-risk aPL carriers.
