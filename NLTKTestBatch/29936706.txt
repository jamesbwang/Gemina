 No consensus exists regarding the best surgical strategy to achieve clear surgical margins while minimizing tissue excision when definitely excising lentigo maligna melanoma in situ ( LM). The staged margin controlled excision ( SMEX) technique is a modification of the spaghetti technique that allows surgeons to minimize margins and ensure complete excision of LM. Our objectives were twofold: a) to evaluate the effectiveness of SMEX for treatment of LM and b) detail the SMEX technique. A retrospective chart review of adult patients who underwent the SMEX technique for treatment of LM from 2011 to 2016 was conducted. Twenty-four patients were identified with predominantly facial lesions<symptom>. The mean defect size was 12.1 cm SMEX offers a reliable surgical excision method that ensures complete excision of LM in a cosmetically sensitive manner. The recurrence outcomes of SMEX are comparable , if not better , than those of alternative excision techniques in the literature.
