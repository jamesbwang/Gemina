 Developmental delay in very young children is trending upward. Maternal depressive symptoms<symptom> are known to negatively impact child development and may also impact family management of the child 's condition. Research on family management guided this second phase of a sequential mixed methods study. The purpose of this study was to explore mothers ' perceptions of family management of their children 's developmental delays. Mothers of very young children who received early intervention services were interviewed. A team-based content analysis approach revealed key findings: ( a) views of the child that were not holistic , ( b) condition management ability was informed by what the mother thought her child needed , ( c) views of condition impact were related to adapting to possible child outcomes and experiences of isolation , and ( d) parental/caregiver mutuality was impaired by conflict. Understanding perceptions of family management and influence of depressive symptoms<symptom> in this context is essential to extend assessment and intervention.
