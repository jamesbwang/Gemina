 This pilot study was performed to investigate safety and local tumor control following transarterial embolization with small-size particles loaded with irinotecan ( DEB-IRI) in patients with colorectal liver metastases ( CRLM). Patients with pretreated CRLM with mono- or bilobar lesions<symptom> involving less than 60 % of the liver parenchyma and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status<symptom> 0 or 1 underwent superselective DEB-IRI embolization with 40 Âµm diameter embolic microspheres. Eighteen patients ( 11 males , 7 females , median age 61 years) underwent 80 embolization procedures ( mean 4.4 , range 2-12 per patient). No serious adverse events were reported within 30 days. A total of 39 treatment-related AEs occurred across all embolization procedures. No G4 or G5 treatment-related AEs occurred. Local tumor control , defined as complete response , partial response , or stable disease<disease> , was achieved in 16/18 ( 88.9 %) , 7/17 ( 41.2 %) , and 3/17 ( 17.6 %) patients at 3 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively. Median liver progression-free survival was 5.9 months ( range 27-409 days) , and median overall survival was 13.5 months. In this small series , DEB-IRI embolization with small beads was demonstrated a safe procedure in the treatment of patients with CRLM. The promising results in terms of liver-specific progression-free survival and overall survival reported deserve further confirmation in larger prospective trials. Level 4 , case series.
