 The major apple allergen Mal d 1 cross-reacts with the homologous birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and causes immunoglobulin E ( IgE)- mediated immediate-type allergic reactions. In some patients , delayed-type hypersensitivity<disease> to apples may develop within 72 hours without evidence of specific IgE or a positive skin prick test ( SPT). The aim of the study was to evaluate the concomitance of delayed-type hypersensitivity<disease> reactions and immediate IgE-mediated reactions against high- and low-allergenic apple cultivars in patients with birch pollen allergy. Data were obtained from 45 adults with clinical symptoms<symptom> of birch pollen allergy. Patients were exposed to apple pulp via atopy patch tests ( APTs) and SPTs. Levels of IgE specific to Bet v 1 and Mal d 1 were measured with a radioallergosorbent test. Patients allergic to birch pollen showed the highest rate of positive SPT responses to Golden Delicious apples and the lowest rate to low-allergenic cultivar Grey French Reinette. Among these patients , 9 % developed delayed hypersensitivity<disease> reactions to either Golden Delicious or Grey French Reinette apples; these reactions manifested clinically as erythema with papules ( class + +). Fifty percent of APT-positive patients were concomitantly SPT-negative. Here , we show for the first time the clinical relevance of T cell-driven allergic reactions to apples. APTs may reveal type IV sensitization in patients who are negative for the corresponding type I sensitization tests. Thus , utilization of the APT procedure with fresh apple appears to be a valuable tool for the diagnosis of apple allergy and may improve the accuracy of food allergy diagnoses.
