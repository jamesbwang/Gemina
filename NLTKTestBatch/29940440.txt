 Ecosystem service ( ES) hotspot mapping is a promising method to spatially identify priority areas for conservation planning. Our study aims to develop a decision-making framework for ES conservation across administrative levels based on ES hotspot and interaction analyses on multiple spatial scales. To demonstrate the framework , we used the Dianchi Lake watershed and the Kunming Prefecture in Southwestern China as examples. We quantified six ES: crop productivity , water yield , habitat quality , soil conservation , total phosphorus retention<symptom> , and recreation potential. In addition , we produced hotspot maps of single and multiple ES on the pixel , sub-river basin , and river<disease> basin scales and calculated the correlation coefficients between the services on these three scales. The decision-making framework was developed based on answering four questions: Who should make conservation decisions? Where should conservation be implemented? What should be conserved? How can ES be conserved? The results demonstrated that the spatial patterns of hotspots of single ES and the interactions among services were dependent on the scale in the Dianchi Lake watershed. In addition , the hotspot overlaps between ES were very poor and the spatial pattern of hotspot overlaps was dependent on what services were chosen. The framework developed in this study can be used to determine the decision-makers , find high priority conservation areas , identify the services that should be conserved , and find the way in which the services can be conserved. The framework provides ES information on multiple spatial scales and can thus facilitate the decision-making process at different administrative levels. In addition , the framework fits into the top-down decision-making system and may help decision-makers generate policies tailored to local realities; therefore , the framework has potential to be used by regional and local administrative decision-makers.
