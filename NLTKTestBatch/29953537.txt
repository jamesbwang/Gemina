 Perceived social support relates to infertility-related distress in couples undergoing assisted reproductive technology ( ART) treatment. Studies examining the effect of other support types on both positive and negative adjustment among infertile couples are scarce or non-existent. Therefore , this study investigated the effects of support receipt , provision , invisibility ( the discrepancy between one partner 's received and the other partner 's provided support) , and equity ( the discrepancy between each partner 's received and provided support) on the positive ( life purpose) and negative ( depressive symptoms<symptom>) indices of well-being in couples undergoing ART treatment. Depressive symptoms<symptom> ( CES-D) , life purpose ( PIL) , and social support ( BSSS) were assessed among 31 married couples ( mean age 32.67 years) undergoing ART treatment. Data were analyzed by applying the Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model ( APIM) using multilevel modeling. Both receiving and providing support had beneficial effects in women and men. However , sub-analysis showed differences according to gender and the support exchange effects. Women reported higher depression<symptom> and lower life purpose but benefited more from support , and their well-being was more dependent on their own perception of support provision and receipt. Men demonstrated higher adjustment to infertility<symptom> but benefited less from support , and their well-being was mostly correlated with supportive behaviors of their wives. Adjustment mechanisms of women and men undergoing ART treatment vary considerably; thus , gender should be taken into consideration in interventions. Future studies should focus on costs/benefits and gender differences of visible and invisible support in infertility<symptom> settings.
