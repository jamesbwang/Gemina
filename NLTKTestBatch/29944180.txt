 Beryllate structures are marginally investigated , but show intriguing structural relations to oxo- and nitridosilicates. A typical feature is the coordination<symptom> of Be both in trigonal planar and tetrahedral coordination<symptom> by O. A broad range of structures is accessible by variable combinations of both building units. Three novel ternary Sr-oxoberyllates are characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis , density functional theory calculations and investigations on luminescence properties: α-SrBeO2 , β-SrBeO2 and Sr12Be17O29 are obtained with oxoberyllate substructures made up of either BeO3 triangles or BeO4 tetrahedra. The compounds can be described as chain- and layer-type beryllates. When excited with blue light of ( In , Ga) N LED chips β-SrBeO2 and Sr12Be17O29 show visible emission in the yellow and orange spectral range , respectively , upon doping with Eu2 +. Exceptional narrow-band yellow emission ( λem = 564 nm , fwhm = 55 nm) make SrBeO2: Eu2 + a promising phosphor for application in phosphor converted ( pc-) LEDs.
