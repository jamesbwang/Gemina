 To explore the correlation between JAK/STAT signaling pathways and pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( ITP). Twenty-six newly-diagnosed ITP patients was included in this study. They all meet the clinical and hematological criteria for the diagnosis of ITP , and patients with coronary heart disease<disease> , severe refractory hypertension , diabetes or with severe liver or kidney function incompetence were ruled out. 24 healthy control without autoimmune diseases<disease> , viral infectious<disease> diseases<disease>diseases<disease> and with normal liver and kidney functions were also included. The expressions of Jak3 , p-Jak3 mRNA , Stat3 , and p-Stat3 were tested and the changes in levels of IL-21 mRNA , IL-21 cell secretion after DEX intervention and AG490 blockade were measured. Compared with the healthy control , patients with ITP had significantly high expressions of Jak3 , p-Jak3 mRNA , Stat3 and p-Stat3 protein , which significantly reduced after AG490 blocking ( P < 0.01). The expression of IL-21 mRNA and the secretion of IL-21 obviously decreased after DEX intervention , but increased after AG490 blocking ( P < 0.01). The pathogenesis of ITP associates with the activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathways , and IL-21-mediated JAK/STAT signaling pathways play regulatory role in ITP.
