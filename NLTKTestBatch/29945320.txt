 Cold agglutinin disease<disease> is a very rare condition associated with agglutination of erythrocytes in cold environment usually due to IgM type antibodies. Other than hemolytic<symptom> anemias<symptom> , it may interfere with routine hemogram tests due to miscalculation of red blood cell count ( RBC) and other hemogram parameters calculated with involvement of RBC. Awareness of the condition is important to overcome laboratory errors. We studied a peripheral blood smear and repeated the hemogram test at 37 °C to establish the diagnosis of cold agglutinin disease<disease>. Initial hemogram test results of the fifty-eight year-old man was as follows: RBC: 1.34 M/µL , hemoglobin ( Hb): 12.4 g/dL , hematocrit ( Htc): 11.8 % , mean corpuscular hemoglobin ( MCH): 92.4 pg , and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration ( MCHC): 105 gr/dL. Despite the standard indirect Coombs test being negative , repeated tests at room temperature was 4 +. We suspected cold agglutinin disease<disease> and repeated the hemogram test using the Bain-Marie method at 37 °C and the test results showed RBC: 3.4 M/µL , hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL , hematocrit: 30.2 % , MCH: 31.7 pg , and MCHC: 41.8 g/dL. Inappropriate hemogram results may be a sign of underlying cold agglutinin disease<disease>. Hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> not always accompanies the disease<disease>; however , cold exposure may trigger erythrocyte agglutination in vitro and may cause erratic laboratory results.
