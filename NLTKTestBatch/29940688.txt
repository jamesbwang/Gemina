 Esthesioneuroblastoma ( ENB) is an uncommon sinonasal tract<symptom> tumor , and it is even more uncommon among all neoplasms. Literature regarding the incidence and spread of the disease<disease> is limited. The prognosis of metastatic disease<disease> is poor. In this report , we present a case of recurrent ENB in a young woman involving metastasis to the neck , lungs , and ovary. Metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes is relatively common , but metastasis to the lungs is rare. Furthermore , to our knowledge , no cases of ovarian metastases of ENB have been reported. This case highlights the potential for widespread metastatic disease<disease> , suggesting the need for more frequent and thorough surveillance of patients diagnosed with recurrences of this tumor.
