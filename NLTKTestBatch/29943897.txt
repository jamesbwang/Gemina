 It is unclear whether exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH) affects lung function in children with asthma. Whether vitamin D insufficiency enhances any detrimental effects of PAH on lung function in asthmatic children is also unknown. Cross-sectional study of 2459 children ( 6-17 years) who participated in the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze the relation between molar mass of urinary PAH metabolites ( sum of all PAH ( ΣmolPAH) , sum of PAH with 2 benzene rings ( Σmol2-PAH) , or sum of PAH with 3 or 4 benzene rings ( Σmol3,4-PAH)) and lung function or exhaled fraction of nitric oxide ( FeNO) in children with and without asthma. In this multivariable analysis , we tested whether vitamin D insufficiency ( a serum 25 ( OH) D level < 30 ng/mL) interacts with PAH exposure on lung function in children with asthma. Among children with asthma , higher ΣmolPAH , and Σmol2-PAH were significantly associated with decreased % predicted FEV1 ( by 3.5-3.8 %). Urinary PAH were not associated with lung function in children without asthma or with FeNO. Given a significant interaction between vitamin D insufficiency and PAH metabolites on lung function in asthmatic children , we stratified the analysis by vitamin D status<symptom>. In this analysis , urinary PAH metabolites were significantly associated with 2.0-5.6 % reduced % predicted FEV1 and % predicted FEV1/FVC in children with asthma and vitamin D insufficiency , but not in those with asthma and vitamin D sufficiency. Vitamin D insufficiency and PAH exposure may have synergistic detrimental effects on lung function in asthmatic children.
