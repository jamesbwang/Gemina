 SYP-14288 is a novel fungicide developed by the Shenyang Research Institute of Chemical Industry in China. Although preliminary studies indicate that SYP-14288 is highly effective against 32 important plant pathogens belonging to a range of taxonomic groups , its mode of action remains unknown. In this study , we documented that SYP-14288 has excellent activity against all of the asexual life stages of the plant-pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora capsici , and is especially effective in blocking cyst<disease><symptom> germination and other life stages that require high energy consumption. In assays designed to determine the fungicide 's mode of action , addition of ATP reduced SYP-14288 inhibition of P. capsici , which suggested that SYP-14288 inhibits ATP synthesis of the pathogen. This inference was confirmed in that treatment with SYP-14288 sharply reduced the ATP content in P. capsici. The respiration<symptom> rate of P. capsici was positively correlated with the concentration of SYP-14288 or of the fungicide fluazinam ( an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation) , but increases in respiration<symptom> were greater with SYP-14288 than with fluazinam. These results indicate that SYP-14288 is a promising fungicide that functions as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation.
