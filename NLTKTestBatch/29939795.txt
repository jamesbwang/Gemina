 Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) commonly experience difficulties in reading and in fluid reasoning ( Gf). According to Cattell 's Investment Theory ( 1987) , Gf is a causal factor in the development of crystallized knowledge ( Gc) and academic skills; therefore , the co-occurrence of reading and Gf difficulties within ADHD may not be coincidental. In the present study with children with both ADHD and reading difficulties ( n = 187; 61 % male; M The direct effect of Gf on all reading skills was nonsignificant; however , significant indirect effects were observed. Specifically , Gf exerted an effect indirectly onto all reading skills through a serial and joint mechanism comprised of Gc and phonemic awareness ( i.e. , Gf → Gc → phonemic awareness → reading achievement). Gf also exerted an effect indirectly onto untimed word recognition and phonemic decoding through phonemic awareness ( i.e. , Gf → phonemic awareness → untimed word recognition/untimed phonemic decoding). Results build upon Cattell 's Investment Theory by linking Gf with reading difficulties among children with ADHD , suggesting that such difficulties may arise from weaknesses<symptom> in Gf and insufficient investment of Gf into reading through Gc and phonemic awareness.
