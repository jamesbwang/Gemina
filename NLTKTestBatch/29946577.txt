 The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of oral health related quality of life ( OHRQoL) on general health in patients suffering of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). Ninty-one patients with RA ( mean age 52.82 ± 11 years , 75.82 % female , 20.87 % smoker) and 30 systemically healthy patients ( control) were evaluated for their OHRQoL by means of Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index ( GOHAI) and Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP) -14 questionnaires. Self-perceived RA status<symptom> was assessed using the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 ( RAPID<symptom> 3). Mean SC-GOHAI score was 3.69 ± 2.47 for RA subjects and 1.36 ± 2.69 in the control group. Statistically significant differences were seen between RA and control ( p < 0.05). RA patients with and without periodontitis<disease> ( PA) exhibited similar SC-GOHAI ( Simple Count GOHAI) scores ( p = 0.980). No statistically significant differences were observed between any of the groups neither for the OHIP 14-extent nor for the OHIP 14-prevalence. RAPID 3 scores showed that the majority of the RA patients ( 65.93 %) had high disease<disease> severity ( RAPID<symptom> 3 > 12 , mean RAPID 3 score 14.39 ± 5.14) Statistically significant higher values were recorded for general health assessment ( PTGE , p = 0.009) and fatigue<symptom> ( FT , p = 0.004) in RA with PA as compared to those without. SC-GOHAI with values between 5-8 was statistically significantly associated with high severity health impairment ( RAPID<symptom> 3 > 12 , p = 0.014 , OR: 8.64). Within their limits , the present findings indicate that: a) moderate OHRQoL as assessed by GOHAI may contribute to the high severity impairment of health in RA patients and b) the GOHAI questionnaire may represent a more adequate tool than OHIP-14 for assessing OHRQoL in patients suffering of RA.
