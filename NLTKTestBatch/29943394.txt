 Endocrine mucin-producing sweat<symptom> gland carcinoma ( EMPSGC) is a rare , low-grade adnexal neoplasm that most commonly involves the eyelid. Analogous to solid papillary carcinoma of the breast , it probably represents a precursor lesion<symptom> to mucinous carcinoma. Here , we describe 11 cases of EMPSGC with molecular analysis. We performed a retrospective search of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute pathology database and identified 11 cases of EMPSGC. Immunohistochemistry was performed for chromogranin , synaptophysin , neuron specific enolase , estrogen receptor ( ER) , epithelial membrane antigen ( EMA) , cytokeratin 7 ( CK7) , and cytokeratin 20 ( CK20). Array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH) and BRAF We observed a strong female predilection ( 73 % females , 8/11 cases) with an average age of 66 years ( range , 56-83 years). EMPSGCs were associated with adjacent benign sweat<symptom> gland cysts<disease><symptom> ( 3/11) , atypical intraductal proliferation ( 1/11) , and mucinous carcinoma ( 1/11). Immunohistochemically , all tumors expressed at least one neuroendocrine marker , ER , EMA , and CK7 , and were negative for CK20. aCGH demonstrated a 6p11 .2 to 6q16 .1 deletion ( 1/2 cases). All cases were negative for BRAF This series provides further histopathologic support that EMPSGC represents a multistage progression to mucinous carcinoma. Additional studies are needed to understand its molecular mechanisms.
