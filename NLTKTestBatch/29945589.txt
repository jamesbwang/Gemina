 Emergency Department ( ED) revisits have often been used as an indicator of medical care quality. This study aimed to quantify the frequency of ED revisits within 72 h of discharge and identify its factors among children with chronic<disease> diseases<disease>diseases<disease>. We designed a retrospective cohort study of children with at least one chronic<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> who were also under 18 years of age and had attended and were discharged from the ED at King Abdullah Specialist Children 's Hospital ( KASCH-RD) , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia between April 19 , 2015 and July 29 , 2017. The outcome measure was the frequency of ED revisits during a period of 72 h after discharge. The study included 11,057 ED discharges of children with at least one chronic<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease>. Their revisit rate was 1211 ( 11 %) , with 83 ( 6.9 %) having had a second ED revisit within 72 h of ED discharge. According to ICD-10 codes , the most common causes of ED revisits were respiratory , digestive , genitourinary , symptoms<symptom> , and external causes. Factors of frequent ED revisits within 72 h were young age , institutional health insurance coverage , year of new health information system ( 2015) , external causes , and genitourinary. The rate of 72-h ED revisits after discharge of children with chronic<disease> diseases<disease>diseases<disease> treated at KASCH-RD was relatively high , and was associated with young age , institutional health insurance coverage , year of a new health information system implementation , and external causes of ED visit. These study findings amplify the need for intervention to reduce the rate of early ED revisits among children with chronic<disease> diseases<disease>diseases<disease>.
