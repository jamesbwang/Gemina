 To provide insights into the long-term impact of radical retro-pubic prostatectomy ( ORRP) on LUTS which are age and prostate dependent and adversely impact quality of life. 1,995 men undergoing ORRP enrolled in a prospective longitudinal outcomes study. The American Urological Association symptom<symptom> index ( AUASI) was self-administered before ORRP and at pre-determined time-points after surgery. A multivariate generalized linear model was used to evaluate the association of time since ORRP with AUASS. McNemar 's test and paired sample t-tests were used to assess whether the proportion of men with clinically significant LUTS ( CSLUTS) defined by an American Urological Association symptom<symptom> score ( AUASS) > 7 or mean AUASS differed significantly between the time-dependent assessments , respectively. The 15 year mean adjusted AUASS was similar to baseline ( 7.00 vs. 6.85 , p = 0.66). Throughout the 15 years of follow-up , the proportion of men with CSLUTS was lower than baseline with the exception of the 3 month and 15 year assessments. Among men with baseline clinically insignificant LUTS ( CILUTS) , the mean adjusted AUASS at 15 years was significantly greater than baseline ( 6.09 vs. 3.19 , p < 0.001). Among men with baseline CSLUTS , ORRP led to a significant decrease in mean adjusted AUASS between baseline and 15 years ( 13.26 vs. 8.67 , p < 0.001). ORRP favorably affects the long-term natural history of LUTS. The long-term economic and quality of life benefits of ORRP on LUTS should inform the risks and benefits of RP for treatment of localized prostate cancer.
