 Most available scoring system to predict outcome after acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) were established in Western countries. We aimed to develop a simple prediction score of 1-month severe disability/death after onset in AIS patients ineligible for recanalization therapy based on readily and widely obtainable on-admission clinical , laboratory and radiological examinations in Asian developing countries. Using the Shiga Stroke Registry , a large population-based registry in Japan , multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted in 1617 AIS patients ineligible for recanalization therapy to yield ß-coefficients of significant predictors of 1-month modified Rankin Scale score of 5-6 , which were then multiplied by a specific constant and rounded to nearest integer to develop 0-10 points system. Model discrimination and calibration were evaluated in the original and bootstrapped population. Japan Coma<symptom> Scale score ( J) , age ( A) , random glucose ( G) , untimely onset-to-arrival time ( U) , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( A) , and preadmission dependency status according to the modified Rankin Scale score ( R) , were recognized as independent predictors of outcome. Each of their β-coefficients was multiplied by 1.3 creating the JAGUAR score. Its area under the curve ( 95 % confidence interval) was .901 ( .880- .922) and .901 ( .900- .901) in the original and bootstrapped population , respectively. It was found to have good calibration in both study population ( P = .27). The JAGUAR score can be an important prediction tool of severe disability/death in AIS patients ineligible for recanalization therapy that can be applied on admission with no complicated calculation and multimodal neuroimaging necessary , thus suitable for Asian developing countries.
