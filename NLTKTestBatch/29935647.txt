 To study the reason ( s) why insured patients discontinue in vitro fertilization ( IVF) before achieving a live birth. Cross-sectional study. Private academically affiliated infertility<symptom> center. A total of 893 insured women who had completed one IVF cycle but did not return for treatment for at least 1 year and who had not achieved a live birth were identified; 312 eligible women completed the survey. None. Reasons for treatment termination. Two-thirds of the participants ( 65.2 %) did not seek care elsewhere and discontinued treatment. When asked why they discontinued treatment , these women indicated that further treatment was too stressful ( 40.2 %) , they could not afford out-of-pocket costs ( 25.1 %) , they had lost insurance coverage ( 24.6 %) , or they had conceived spontaneously ( 24.1 %). Among those citing stress as a reason for discontinuing treatment ( n = 80) , the top sources of stress included already having given IVF their best chance ( 65.0 %) , feeling too stressed to continue ( 47.5 %) , and infertility<symptom> taking too much of a toll on their relationship ( 36.3 %). When participants were asked what could have made their experience better , the most common suggestions were evening/weekend office hours ( 47.4 %) and easy access to a mental health professional ( 39.4 %). Of the 34.8 % of women who sought care elsewhere , the most common reason given was wanting a second opinion ( 55.7 %). Psychologic burden was the most common reason why insured patients reported discontinuing IVF treatment. Stress reduction strategies are desired by patients and could affect the decision to terminate treatment.
