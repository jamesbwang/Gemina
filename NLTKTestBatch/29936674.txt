 Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia<symptom> ( CDA) is a heterogeneous group of rare congenital disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and dysplastic changes in erythroblasts. Diagnosis of CDA is based primarily on the morphology of bone<disease> marrow erythroblasts; however , genetic tests have recently become more important. Here , we performed genetic analysis of 10 Japanese patients who had been diagnosed with CDA based on laboratory findings and morphological characteristics. We examined 10 CDA patients via central review of bone<disease> marrow morphology and genetic analysis for congenital bone<disease> marrow failure syndromes<symptom>. Sanger sequencing for CDAN1 , SEC23B , and KLF1 was performed for all patients. We performed whole-exome sequencing in patients without mutation in these genes. Three patients carried pathogenic CDAN1 mutations , whereas no SEC23B mutations were identified in our cohort. WES unexpectedly identified gene mutations known to cause congenital hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> in two patients: canonical G6PD p.Val394Leu mutation and SPTA1 p.Arg28His mutation. Comprehensive genetic analysis is warranted for more effective diagnosis of patients with suspected CDA.
