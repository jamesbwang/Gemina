 We aimed to determine the benefits/efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions ( MBIs) implemented among adolescents with chronic<disease> diseases<disease> in clinical settings. An electronic search of PubMed , CINAHL , and PsycINFO databases was conducted in November 2017 to identify studies in which mindfulness was the primary intervention delivered for adolescents with chronic<disease> diseases<disease> to improve psychological and physical health. Nineteen eligible studies were included in this review. Fifteen studies included adolescents with psychiatric or pain disorders , and four included adolescents with a chronic physical disorders. Psychological outcomes and<symptom> pain<symptom> were examined in most studies with effect sizes for MBIs ranging from small to large. MBI studies conducted in clinical settings mainly engaged adolescents with psychiatric or pain disorders. The effectiveness of MBIs on improving psychological outcomes were inconsistent. Large randomized trials are needed to examine the effectiveness of MBIs and should expand to include adolescents with chronic physical diseases<disease>.
