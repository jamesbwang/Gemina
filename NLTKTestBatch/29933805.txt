 High-grade dysplastic spondylolisthesis ( HGDS) is a subset of L5-S1 spondylolisthesis that occurs due to dysmorphic anatomy at the lumbosacral junction , often resulting in sagittal imbalance. Enhanced understanding of global sagittal alignment has led many to preferentially treat HGDS with reduction and fusion to restore sagittal balance<symptom>. The purpose of this article is to review published surgical techniques for obtaining sagittal correction in HGDS and to evaluate the current evidence regarding the associated surgical complications.
