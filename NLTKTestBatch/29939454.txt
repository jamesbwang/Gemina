 Ions transport through confined space with characteristic dimensions comparable to the Debye length has many applications , for example , in water desalination , dialysis , and energy conversion. However , existing 2D/3D smart porous membranes<symptom> for ions transport and further applications are fragile , thermolabile , and/or difficult to scale up , limiting their practical applicability. Now , polymeric carbon nitride alternatively allows the creation of an ultrathin free-standing carbon nitride membrane ( UFSCNM) , which can be fabricated by simple CVD polymerization and exhibits excellent nanofluidic ion-transport properties. The surface-charge-governed ion transport also endows such UFSCNMs with the function of converting salinity gradients into electric energy. With advantages of low cost , facile fabrication , and the ease of scale up while supporting high ionic currents , UFSCNM can be considered as an alternative for energy conversion systems and new ionic devices.
