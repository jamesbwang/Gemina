 Material flow analysis shows that soil is a key repository for silver ( Ag) from ( nano) silver-functionalised consumer products , but the potential effects of Ag toxicity , via Ag + release , on soil microbial communities and their ecosystem services remains largely unknown. We examined the responses of multiple microbial biomarkers to increasing Ag + doses ( nine concentrations , 0-2000 mg kg-1) in nine different soils representing a wide range of soil properties. Analyses included substrate-induced microbial respiration<symptom> , nine different soil enzyme activities , and quantification of bacterial 16S-rRNA ( SSU) and fungal intergenic spacer ( ITS) gene copies. The resulting half maximal effective concentrations ( EC50) for Ag ranged from ~ 1 to > 500 mg kg -1 and showed soil-specific responses , including some hormesis-type responses. Carbon cycle-associated enzyme activities ( e.g. cellobiohydrolase , xylosidase , and α/β-glucosidase) responded similarly to Ag. Sulfatase and leucine-aminopeptidase activities ( linked to the sulfur and nitrogen cycles) were the most sensitive to Ag. Total organic carbon , and to a lesser extent pH , were identified as potentially useful response predictors , but only for some biomarkers; this reflects the complexity of soil Ag chemistry. Our results show Ag toxicity is highly dependent on soil characteristics and the specific microbial parameter under investigation , but endpoint redundancies also indicated that representative parameters for key microbial functions can be identified for risk assessment purposes. Sulfatase activity may be an important Ag toxicity biomarker; its response was highly sensitive and not correlated with that of other biomarkers.
