 Litter size is an important economic traits in pigs. SLA-11 gene is a member of SLA ( swine leukocyte antigen) complex. In our previous study , the SLA-11 gene was differentially expressed in PMSG-hCG stimulated preovulatory ovarian follicles of Chinese Taihu and Large White<symptom> sows. Here , we identified two mutations ( c.754-132 T > C and c. 1421 + 38 T > C) in SLA-11 gene and analyzed the associations of two SNPs with litter size traits in Large White<symptom> ( n = 263) and DIV ( n = 117) sows. The results showed that in Large White<symptom> pigs , SLA-11 c.754-132 CC sows produced 0.74 and 0.87 more pigs per litter for TNB and NBA of all parities than did TT sows ( p < .05); In DIV pigs , SLA-11 c.754-132 CC sows produced 1.17 more pigs per litter for TNB of all parities than did TC sows ( p < .05). In Large White<symptom> pigs , SLA-11 c. 1421 + 38 CC sows produced 0.9 more pigs per litter for TNB of all parities than did TT sows ( p < .05) , while in DIV pigs SLA-11 c. 1421 + 38 CC sows produced 0.84 and 0.7 less pigs per litter for TNB and NBA of all parities than did TT sows ( p < .05). Our research indicated that SLA-11 mutations were potential molecular markers for improving the litter size traits in pigs.
