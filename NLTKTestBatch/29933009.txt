 Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion ( CCH) has been associated with aging-related vascular dementia , including Alzheimer 's disease<disease>. It can be induced by the four-vessel occlusion/internal carotid artery ( 4VO/ICA) model in aged rats , resulting in persistent memory deficits , white matter injury , and significant neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor ( PDE4-I) roflumilast has been reported to have pro-cognitive effects in several behavioral paradigms. The present study evaluated the effects of repeated roflumilast treatment in aged rats that were subjected to CCH. After surgery , roflumilast ( 0.003 and 0.01 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally once per day for 29 days. Memory performance was assessed in the aversive radial maze ( AvRM) 7 , 14 , and 21 days after CCH. The effects of roflumilast on hippocampal neurodegeneration and white matter injury were investigated using Nissl and Kluver-Barrera staining , respectively. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to explore microglial polarization using M1 ( Iba-1 and iNOS) and M2 ( Arginase-1) markers. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion caused persistent memory deficits , hippocampal neurodegeneration , and vacuolization and fiber disarrangement in white matter. Repeated roflumilast treatment restored CCH-induced cognitive impairments in aged rats but in the absence of the rescue of hippocampal neurons. Attenuation of white matter injury was detected in the optic tract<symptom> in aged CCH rats that were treated with roflumilast. In vitro , roflumilast increased Arg-1 gene expression in myelin-laden primary microglia. The present data suggest that roflumilast might be useful for the treatment of cognitive sequelae associated with CCH.
