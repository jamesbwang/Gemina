 Yeast nucleotides are a fine functional additive in human and animals. The effects of dietary yeast nucleotides supplementation on intestinal development , expression of intestinal barrier-related genes , intestinal microbiota , and infectious bronchitis<symptom> virus<pathogen> ( IBV) antibody titer of specific pathogen-free ( SPF) chickens were investigated. A total of 60 1-d-old chickens were divided into 4 groups , each of which included 3 replicates of 5 chickens. Group 1 served as a control that was fed a basal diet. Groups 2 to 4 were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.1 % , 0.3 % and 0.5 % yeast nucleotides , respectively. All chickens were inoculated intranasally with inactivated IBV vaccine at day 1 and day 10. At day 17 , the intestinal development , expression of intestinal barrier-related genes and microbiota were evaluated. There was a significant increased ileal villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in group 2 ( P < 0.05). Moreover , group 4 exhibited higher expression of zonula occludens-1 ( ZO-1) and Occludin gene in ileum ( P < 0.05) , whereas groups 2 and 3 exhibited higher expression of Mucin 2 ( MUC2) and trefoil factor 2 ( TFF2) gene ( P < 0.05) , group 2 showed lower expression of IFN-Î± gene ( P < 0.05). Dietary yeast nucleotides increased intestinal bacterial diversity ( P < 0.05) , and the abundance of Lactobacillus ( P < 0.05). At day 10 , 17 , 24 , 31 , 38 , and 45 , the serum IBV antibody titers were tested. Group 2 exhibited higher IBV antibody titer at day 17 ( P < 0.05) , furthermore , groups 2 to 4 reached the effective levels 1 wk earlier than control group. In conclusion , dietary yeast nucleotides supplementation can help birds to mount a faster and stronger antibody response to IBV vaccine. In addition , dietary yeast nucleotides supplementation can also promote the intestinal development and barrier-related genes expression , and diversity and richness of intestinal microbiota.
