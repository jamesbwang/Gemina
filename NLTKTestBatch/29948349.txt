 Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) patients have a high risk for cardiovascular events , but few studies have evaluated the recognition and none have evaluated the control of cardiovascular risk factors ( RF) in SLE patients. The study aims to describe the recognition and control frequencies of systemic arterial hypertension ( SAH) , dyslipidemia , and diabetes mellitus ( DM) in SLE patients. Of the female patients with SLE , 137 answered a questionnaire focused on general knowledge of the RF for coronary artery disease<disease> ( CAD) and on recognition of the risk factors that they possess. The patient 's information collected on a structured medical record was reviewed to evaluate the RF control. The mean age was 29.1 ( 9.6) years. Seventy patients had SAH; 85.7 % recognized their condition and 71.4 % had desirable blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) control ( < 140 Ã— 90 mmHg). From a group of 63 patients with dyslipidemia , 68.3 % recognized that they had dyslipidemia and 69.8 % had desirable LDL-cholesterol ( < 130 mg/dL). Sixteen patients had DM; 87.5 % admitted being diabetic and 50.0 % had desirable glycemic control ( HbA1C < 7 %). Most patients were aware of presenting SAH , DM , or dyslipidemia , and the recognition frequency was higher in comparison to general population. The SAH and dyslipidemia control frequencies were higher than that described for the general population.
