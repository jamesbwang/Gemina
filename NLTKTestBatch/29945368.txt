 Chinese medicine Buyang Huanwu decoction ( BYHW) is widely used in treating cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome<symptom> , but the pharmacological basis is still not clear. This study aims to uncover the biological basis of BYHW therapy for cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome<symptom> using label-free proteomic technology. Using Qi deficiency and blood stasis rat cerebral infarction model as the research object , the protein expression of rat brain tissue was compared among the sham operation group , the model group and the drug group. Quantitative analysis of the 3 groups of tissue samples detected 3 959 , 3 996 and 4 055 proteins in the sham operation group , the model group and the drug group , respectively. Take model group as the control group , 391 proteins were identified to be upregulated or downregulated for more than 2 folds. Biological analysis and functional enrichment of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that BYHW may treat cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome<symptom> through energy metabolism , nervous system and several signal pathways. This study preliminarily revealed the pharmacological mechanism of BYHW at the protein level , and provided a molecular basis for clinical treatment and traditional Chinese medicine research on cerebral infarction combined with Qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome<symptom>.
