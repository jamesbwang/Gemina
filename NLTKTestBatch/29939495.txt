 Metabotyping describes the grouping of metabolically similar individuals. We aimed to identify valid metabotypes in a large cohort for targeted dietary intervention , e.g. for disease<disease> prevention. We grouped 1729 adults aged 32-77 years of the German population-based KORA F4 study ( 2006-2008) using k-means cluster analysis based on 34 biochemical and anthropometric parameters. We identified three metabolically distinct clusters showing significantly different biochemical parameter concentrations. Cardiometabolic disease<disease> status<symptom> was determined at baseline in the F4 study and at the 7-year follow-up termed FF4 ( 2013/2014) to compare disease<disease> prevalence and incidence between clusters. Cluster 3 showed the most unfavorable marker profile with the highest prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases<disease>. Also , disease<disease> incidence was higher in cluster 3 compared to clusters 2 and 1 , respectively , for hypertension ( 41.2 %/ 25.3 %/ 18.2 %) , type 2 diabetes ( 28.3 %/ 5.1 %/ 2.0 %) , hyperuricemia/gout ( 10.8 %/ 2.3 %/ 0.7 %) , dyslipidemia ( 19.2 %/ 18.3 %/ 5.6 %) , all metabolic ( 54.5 %/ 36.8 %/ 19.7 %) and all cardiovascular ( 6.3 %/ 5.5 %/ 2.3 %) diseases<disease> together. Cluster analysis based on an extensive set of biochemical and anthropometric parameters allows the identification of comprehensive metabotypes that were distinctly different in cardiometabolic disease<disease> occurrence. As a next step , targeted dietary strategies should be developed with the goal of preventing diseases<disease> , especially in cluster 3. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
