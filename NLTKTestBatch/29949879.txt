 PPAR & gamma; belongs to the group of nuclear receptors which is expressed in the trophoblast and together with other factors is responsible for the maintenance of pregnancy. Apart from that PPAR & gamma; is also a main factor for macrophage polarization. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined expression pattern and frequency of PPAR & gamma; under physiological circumstances and in spontaneous and recurrent miscarriages in the trophoblast and in maternal macrophages of the decidua. Human placental tissues of the first trimester ( 15 physiologic pregnancies , 15 spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> and 16 recurrent miscarriage placentas) were analyzed for expression of the nuclear receptor PPAR & gamma;. Expression changes were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and real time PCR ( RT-PCR) in trophoblast and in maternal macrophages of the decidua. Maternal macrophages were identified by double immunofluorescence using cluster of differentiation 68 ( CD68) as marker for macrophages and further characterized regarding their M1/M2 polarization status<symptom>. The intermediate villous trophoblast revealed a significantly lower PPAR & gamma; expression in spontaneous and recurrent abortion<disease>. Maternal macrophages express PPAR & gamma;. Their number is significantly enhanced in the decidua of spontaneous miscarriages whereas in recurrent miscarriages maternal macrophages seem to express PPAR & gamma; only in very few cases. PPAR & gamma; is associated with an M2 polarization state that is common for decidual macrophages. The lack of PPAR & gamma; in recurrent miscarriage decidual macrophages seems to be associated with a specific inflammatory response against the fetus.
