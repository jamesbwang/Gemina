 The structure of paramagnetic surface species is notoriously difficult to determine. For Ti ( III) centers related to Ziegler-Natta catalysis , we demonstrate here that detailed structural information can be obtained by advanced EPR spectroscopy and DFT computations , benchmarked on molecular analogues. The hyperfine sublevel correlation ( HYSCORE) spectra obtained after reaction with 13C-labelled ethylene provides information about the coupling for a proton in the first coordination<symptom> sphere of Ti ( III) as well as significant 13C hyperfine coupling and thereby allows structural assignment of the surface species.
