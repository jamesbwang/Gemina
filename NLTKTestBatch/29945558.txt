 Management of stable patients with abdominal stab wound<disease> remains controversial , particularly for those with no clear indications for explorative laparotomy. We evaluated the risk of intra-abdominal injury in stab wound<disease> victims concomitantly stabbed in other anatomical body areas. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with abdominal stab wounds<disease> recorded in the Israeli<disease> National Trauma Registry from January 1st , 1997 , to December 31st , 2013. Patients with an isolated abdominal stab wound<disease> were compared to those with concomitant stab wounds<disease> to other anatomical areas. Intra-abdominal organ injury was defined by imaging or surgery findings. Multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model was conducted to assess independent risk for intra-abdominal organ injury. The study included 3964 patients. After controlling for age , gender and hypotension<symptom> on arrival , patients with multi-regional stab wounds<disease> had an increased risk of intra-abdominal injury ( OR = 1.3 , CI 95 % 1.1-1.6 , p < 0.001). These patients also had a higher rate of injury to the solid organs than patients with an isolated abdominal stab wound<disease>. Patients with multi-regional stab wounds<disease> have an increased risk of intra-abdominal injury. Worldwide accepted `` clinical follow up '' protocol may not be appropriate in management of patients with multi-regional stab wounds<disease>.
