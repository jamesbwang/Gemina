 The major pandemics caused by chronic viral<disease> infections<disease> is produced by HIV<pathogen> , hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) , and hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) , with estimates of 38 , 70 , and 250 million people worldwide , respectively ( Fig. 1). During the last couple of years , the advent of direct oral antivirals has allowed pursuing global HCV<pathogen> eradication. In an unprecedented manner , these drugs cure more than 95 % of hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> patients when given for only 2-3 months. The enthusiasm on HCV<pathogen> has renewed the interest for curative strategies for both HIV<pathogen> and HBV. However , important biological differences between all three viruses<pathogen> may preclude envisioning a similar rapid success for either HIV<pathogen> or HBV<pathogen> than for HCV<pathogen> infection. As shown in figure 1 , once infection of targeted cells has occurred , the viral genetic material only replicates in the cytosol for HCV<pathogen> whereas it enters the nucleus and integrates into the chromosomes as provirus<pathogen> for HIV<pathogen> or is converted in a circular covalently closed form ( cccDNA) for HBV<pathogen> ( Fig. 1). Blocking viral nucleic acid replication for a minimum lag of time allows definitive clearance of HCV<pathogen> infection , with degradation of residual cytoplasmic HCV-RNA strands. In contrast , blocking viral replication has only a transient effect on HIV<pathogen> or HBV , as mRNA expression resumes following treatment discontinuation , given the stability of the HIV<pathogen> provirus<pathogen> or the HBV cccDNA , respectively. The European Liver meeting took held in Paris on April 2018. A relatively large number of presentations addressed distinct new hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> therapeutic strategies. Table 1 summarizes some of the molecules that have been investigated so far with more promising results , grouping them into distinct drug classes ( Soriano et al.. Exp Op Inv Drugs 2017; 26:843-51) , based on their distinct mechanism of action and targeted steps in the HBV life cycle ( Fig. 2). Considering the pros and cons of novel HBV<pathogen> therapeutic candidates , it has become apparent new HBV<pathogen> gene therapies among the most attractive. Several advances have contributed to position gene therapy in front within the experimental HBV<pathogen> armamentarium. First , progresses in delivery systems , including the use of polymers and nanoformulations have allowed developing easier forms of administration that now are becoming subcutaneous and monthly. Second , the synthetic production of oligonucleotide formulations has reduced costs. Third , the specificity against HBV is higher than for other experimental agents , as immune modulators that enhance innate immunity , such as TLR agonists ( i.e. , GS-9620) or checkpoint inhibitors ( i.e. , nivolumab). Fourth , significant declines in serum hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> surface antigen ( HBsAg) are demonstrated during gene therapy , which have never been seen using the most potent polymerase inhibitors ( i.e. , tenofovir or entecavir). Finally , unanticipated significant reductions in cccDNA are seen with HBV<pathogen> gene therapy , most likely as prove of an indirect benefit of waning the immunosuppressive effect of large over amounts of HBsAg released by infected hepatocytes that contributes to T-cell exhaustion<symptom>. In a pioneering study , Roche was the first to publish the potent effect of an oral small molecule that blocked HBV<pathogen> gene expression ( Mueller et al.. J Hepatol 2018; 68:412-20). The drug belonged to the dihydroquinolizinone class , and directly or indirectly modified viral RNAs , promoting their degradation. This posttranscriptional silencing was accompanied by rapid drops in HBV-DNA and more importantly in serum HBsAg in the humanized mice. However , Roche decided to discontinue any further clinical development of the drug. Nowadays , two major groups of agents are being developed as HBV<pathogen> gene therapies. At this time , interference RNA ( iRNA) molecules and nucleic acid polymers ( NAPs) are the most promising. Overall , iRNA is double-stranded RNA molecules , 20 nucleotides long. One strand matches a segment of specific HBV<pathogen> mRNA and induces its degradation. Several iRNA molecules have entered into Phase II clinical trials ( Flisiak et al.. Exp Op Biol Ther , in press) , including ARB-1467 and AB-729 ( Arbutus) , ARO-HBV ( Arrowhead) , ALN-HBV ( Alnylam) , and IONIS-HBVRx ( Ionis). In most cases , they are tested as part of combination therapy with nucleos ( t) ide analogs and/or peginterferon. NAPs are phosphorothioate 40 length oligonucleotides that no map any HBV<pathogen> sequence. However , they interact with a liver host target protein ( apolipoprotein-like) and result in specific inhibition of HBV<pathogen> mRNAs. This is followed by rapid suppression of HBsAg release ( Roehl et al.. Mol Ther Nuc Acids 2017; 8:1-12). In a pilot study with intravenous REP-2139 , investigators from Replicor demonstrated strong reductions in HBV-DNA along with significant drops in HBsAg and seroconversion in some patients. More interestingly was the recognition of significant reductions in hepatic cccDNA , most likely a result of an indirect effect following the removal of large amounts of HBsAg from the bloodstream that contributes to impaired T-cell responses in chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> patients ( Bazinet et al.. EASL , Paris 2018; abstract FRI-343). An improved NAP , named REP-2165 and subcutaneous administration are currently being tested.
