 Metronidazole is a drug of choice for amebic liver abscess<symptom> ( ALA) , but has long course and significant side effects. Thus , drugs like tinidazole with a better tolerability record need evaluation. We conducted a randomized controlled trial at the Department of Gastroenterology , SMS Hospital , Jaipur , India. One hundred and fifty admitted patients were randomized into two treatment groups , metronidazole ( group M , n = 75) and tinidazole ( group T , n = 75). Patients were observed for clinical response , laboratory parameters , imaging , and side effects. Early clinical response ( ECR) was defined as the absence of fever<symptom> and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> within 72 h of treatment. Symptomatic clinical response ( SCR) was defined as the absence of fever<symptom> and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> irrespective of duration of treatment required. Follow up was done at 1 , 3 , and 6 months. ECR was 62.3 % in group T vs. 37.7 % in group M ( p = 0.02). SCR was shorter in group T than group M ( 3.29 ± 1.61 days vs. 5.67 ± 2.93 , p ≤ 0.001). Mean residual volume at the end of 1 month was lower in group T ( 130.7 ± 108.1 vs. 184.7 ± 143.3 mL , p = 0.01) and no significant difference was seen at 3 and 6 months. Tinidazole was better tolerated with fewer side effects. Low socioeconomic status<symptom> , baseline abscess<symptom> volume > 500 mL , hypoalbuminemia , pleural effusion<symptom> , and history of ethanol use were associated with a late clinical response on univariate analysis of which low socioeconomic status<symptom> was the only associated factor. Tinidazole , as compared to metronidazole , has early clinical response , shorter treatment course , favorable rate of recovery , and high tolerability; thus , tinidazole can be preferred over metronidazole in ALA..
