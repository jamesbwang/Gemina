 Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA) influence learned behaviors and neuropsychiatric diseases<disease> including addiction. The stress peptide corticotrophin-releasing factor ( CRF) contributes to relapse to drug and alcohol seeking following withdrawal<symptom> , although the cellular actions are poorly understood. In this study , we show that presynaptic CRF type 1 receptors ( CRF-R1) potentiate GABA release onto mouse VTA dopamine neurons via a PKC-Ca
