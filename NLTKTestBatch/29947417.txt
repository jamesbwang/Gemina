 Several Cinnamomum species ' barks are generally labeled as cinnamon although only Cinnamomum verum carries the common name of true cinnamon. Cassia , a common name for a related species , is rarely used on labels; instead various cassia types may also be labeled cinnamon. Confusion<symptom> of true cinnamon and cassia spices in foods generally does not present a risk to health , except possibly at the highest intake levels. However , clinical studies with Cinnamomum investigational products have been published that inadequately describe or lack botanical identification information. The results of such studies are confounded by an inability to determine which species was responsible for the observed effects. Due to differences in the quality and composition of various Cinnamomum species , safety and efficacy data are not generalizable or transferable. Pharmacopeial monographs for characterizing the identity , composition , purity , quality and strength of Cinnamomum investigational products should be applied to remove the ambiguity of cinnamon.
