 Intracranial delivery of therapeutic agents is limited by penetration beyond the blood-brain barrier ( BBB) and rapid metabolism of the drugs that are delivered. Convection-enhanced delivery ( CED) of drug-loaded nanoparticles ( NPs) provides for local administration , control of distribution , and sustained drug release. While some investigators have shown that repeated CED procedures are possible , longer periods of sustained release could eliminate the need for repeated infusions , which would enhance safety and translatability of the approach. Here , we demonstrate that nanoparticles formed from poly ( ethylene glycol)- poly ( Ï‰-pentadecalactone-co-p-dioxanone) block copolymers ( PEG-poly ( PDL-co-DO)) are highly efficient nanocarriers that provide long-term release: small nanoparticles ( less than 100 nm in diameter) continuously released a radiosensitizer ( VE822) over a period of several weeks in vitro , provided widespread intracranial drug distribution during CED , and yielded significant drug retention<symptom> within the brain for over 1 week. One advantage of PEG-poly ( PDL-co-DO) nanoparticles is that hydrophobicity can be tuned by adjusting the ratio of hydrophobic PDL to hydrophilic DO monomers , thus making it possible to achieve a wide range of drug release rates and drug distribution profiles. When administered by CED to rats with intracranial RG2 tumors , and combined with a 5-day course of fractionated radiation therapy , VE822-loaded PEG-poly ( PDL-co-DO) NPs significantly prolonged survival when compared to free VE822. Thus , PEG-poly ( PDL-co-DO) NPs represent a new type of versatile nanocarrier system with potential for sustained intracranial delivery of therapeutic agents to treat brain tumors.
