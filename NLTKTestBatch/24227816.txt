 Specific genetic deficiencies are a rare cause that should be included in the diagnostic algorithm of disseminated herpetic<symptom> lesions<symptom>. The aim of this article is to describe the ocular herpetic manifestations in a rare genetic disorder called GATA2 deficiency. We present the clinical case of a 26-year-old male with dendritic ulcers<disease><symptom> in his cornea , marrow aplasia and idiopathic chronic lymphedema. He was diagnosed with GATA2 deficiency. GATA2 gene is critical for the genesis and function of hematopoietic stem cells. Its deficiency can cause myelodysplastic syndromes<symptom> , congenital lymphedema and severe viral<disease> infections<disease>. Our patient presented these three manifestations , added to a deletion in 20q12 that confirmed the suspicion of GATA2 mutation. A bone<disease> marrow transplant was suggested as definitive treatment. The corneal herpetic epithelial lesion<symptom> was analogous to a regular hepetic keratitis<disease><symptom> with none stromal keratitis<disease><symptom>.
