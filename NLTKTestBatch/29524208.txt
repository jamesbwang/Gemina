 Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is one of the most diagnosed cancers in the world. Even though screening , surgery and oncology have greatly advanced , CRC is still one of the leading causes of cancer deaths , with 700,000 annual mortalities in both men and women. Environmental and lifestyle factors brought up by industrialization , such as an altered diet , lack of physical activity , increase in alcohol consumption , and circadian disruption , have greatly affected the burden of CRC. These factors increase the CRC risk , at least partly , by pathologically altering the colonic environment , including composition of the gut microbiota , referred to as dysbiosis. Colonic dysbiosis can promote pro-carcinogenic immune signaling cascades , leading to pro-tumorigenic inflammation<symptom> , carcinogen production , and altered cellular responses in susceptible host resulting to development and/or progression of CRC. Nutraceuticals such as prebiotic molecules and probiotic bacterial species can help maintain intestinal microbial homeostasis and thus mitigate this pathological processes. Therefore , prebiotics and probiotics can hinder the effects of dysbiosis by encouraging anti-carcinogenic , anti-inflammatory immunity , the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier , pro-apoptotic mechanisms , and carcinogen inactivation. In addition to its implications in preventing CRC , because of the mechanisms affected , nutraceuticals are being discovered as potential adjuncts to immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of CRC. In this review , we provide an overview of the potential implications of prebiotics and probiotics in the prevention and treatment of CRC.
