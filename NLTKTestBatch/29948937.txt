 Bisphosphonate drug therapy provides benefits in the case of osteoporosis and carcinomas metastasizing to the bones , but it exposes patients to important side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and the appropriate surgical treatment of bone lesions<symptom> and fractures due to antiresorptive drug-related osteonecrosis of the jaws ( ARONJ). Patients presenting with osteonecrosis lesions<symptom> of the jaw , who were referred to the Maxillo-Facial unit of the University of L'Aquila , were considered for inclusion. Grade of the lesion<symptom> and treatment choice was recorded for each patient. Descriptive statistics were calculated and the data were analysed with Chi-squared tests. A representative case of a fracture reduction with a supra-periostal approach is reported. Among the 165 patients with ARONJ lesions<symptom> , 112 were female and 53 were male. In total , 115 patients received intra-venous bisphosphonate therapy and 50 received oral bisphosphonate therapy. Five stage 2 lesions<symptom> , three stage 2 lesions<symptom> and two stage 3 lesions<symptom> were not a consequence of dental procedures. Eighteen surgical bone excisions were performed and four pathological fractures were reduced. In one case ( the reported one) , the combined use of platelet-rich plasma and the supra-periostal approach leads to a successful 1-year follow-up. ARONJ lesions<symptom> are a type of pathological bone disease<disease> affecting the jawbones. The pathology pathway remains a controversial and frequently discussed topic. A surgically conservative strategy seems to be the best way to assure a comfortable quality of life to those patients negatively affected by this condition.
