 Adolescents with excess weight<symptom> suffer social stress more frequently than their peers with normal weight<symptom>. To examine the impact of social stress , specifically negative social evaluation , on executive functions in adolescents with excess weight<symptom>. We also examined associations between subjective stress , autonomic reactivity , and executive functioning. Sixty adolescents ( aged 13-18 years) classified into excess weight<symptom> or normal weight<symptom> groups participated. We assessed executive functioning ( working memory , inhibition , and shifting) and subjective stress levels before and after the Trier Social Stress Task ( TSST). The TSST was divided into two phases according to the feedback of the audience: positive and negative social evaluation. Heart rate and<symptom> skin conductance were recorded. Adolescents with excess weight<symptom> showed poorer executive functioning after exposure to TSST compared with adolescents with normal weight<symptom>. Subjective stress and autonomic reactivity were also greater in adolescents with excess weight<symptom> than adolescents with normal weight<symptom>. Negative social evaluation was associated with worse executive functioning and increased autonomic reactivity in adolescents with excess weight<symptom>. The findings suggest that adolescents with excess weight<symptom> are more sensitive to social stress triggered by negative evaluations. Social stress elicited deterioration of executive functioning in adolescents with excess weight<symptom>. Evoked increases in subjective stress and autonomic responses predicted decreased executive function. Deficits in executive skills could reduce cognitive control abilities and lead to overeating in adolescents with excess weight<symptom>. Strategies to cope with social stress to prevent executive deficits could be useful to prevent future obesity in this population.
