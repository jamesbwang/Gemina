 Four dimeric lanthanide alkoxide complexes bearing ONNO bipyrrolidine salan ligands ( LMeH2/LtBuH2) have been prepared with Nd , Sm and Yb. Depending on the metal and substituents , these complexes adopt varying coordination<symptom> geometries. While investigating the hydrolytic degradation of these complexes , three dimeric mixed alkoxide/hydroxide and bis-hydroxide products were also prepared , isolated and characterised. Despite paramagnetism , 1H NMR and diffusion ordered spectroscopy ( DOSY) allowed additional characterisation alongside elemental and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. These systems were very active for the controlled ring-opening polymerisation ( ROP) of rac-lactide ( LA) , under industrially relevant melt conditions and in solution , yielding complete conversion within 5 minutes at ( Ln): ( LA) ratios of up to 3000: 1 in toluene , and at 80 °C , whilst retaining low dispersities ( Đ = 1.1). 1H DOSY NMR spectroscopy was employed to monitor polymer growth from the metal centres in situ , and revealed a dinuclear catalytically active species.
