 Hematidrosis is an eccrine sweat<symptom> disorder characterized by one or more episodes of spontaneous , bloody sweating from non-traumatized skin. The author carried out a systematic review of all cases of hematidrosis reported in PubMed over the past 20 years. A total of 25 cases were reviewed; 21 were women ( 84 %) , the median age was 13 years ( range 9-72) , and the majority ( 62 %) were from Asia , mainly India. Hematidrosis was located on the face-including the forehead ( 40 %) , eyes ( 40 %) , and ears<disease> ( 36 %)- in 96 % of the cases and on the umbilicus in 24 % and the palms in 20 %. Prodromal symptoms<symptom> were reported by almost 30 % of the patients. Possible triggering factors were identified in 56 % of the cases; most of these ( 86 %) were stress factors within families ( conflicts or abuse) or at school. In two cases , platelet dysfunction and epilepsy were suspected as culprits. Nine patients had a psychiatric diagnosis associated with hematidrosis. The outcome was favorable in most of the cases with medical treatment ( e.g. , beta-blocker , anxiolytics) and psychological support. The number of cases has increased in recent years. Hematidrosis appears to be a somatization disorder that mainly affects children from developing countries. Its physiopathology remains largely unknown. It deserves better recognition because it is usually a temporary condition when managed properly.
