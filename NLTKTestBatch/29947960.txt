 Lung cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide. Despite significant advances in diagnosis and treatment , mortality rates remain extremely high , close to incidence rates. Several targeted therapies have been recently introduced for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , the most common type of lung cancer. Nivolumab , a monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death-1 ( PD-1) , was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC not responding to platinum-based chemotherapy. Biomarkers predicting response to these therapies would allow early identification of non-responders and timely implementation of appropriate combination strategies , avoiding inadequate and expensive therapies. The role of the neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio and other blood cell count indexes as possible biomarkers of response has been recently investigated. We discuss the encouraging results reported on the topic , provide new data from our personal experience , and discuss opportunities for further research.
