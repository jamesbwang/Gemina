 Patients with chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD) are at high risk for developing cardiovascular events. However , limited evidence is available regarding the use of aspirin in CKD patients to decrease cardiovascular risk and to slow renal disease<disease> progression. Prospective , multicenter , open-label randomized controlled trial. One hundred eleven patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) 15-60 ml/min/1 .73 m Aspirin treatment ( 100 mg/day) ( n = 50) or usual therapy ( n = 61). Mean follow-up time was 64.8 ± 16.4 months. The primary endpoint was composed of cardiovascular death , acute coronary syndrome<symptom> ( nonfatal MI , coronary revascularization , or unstable angina pectoris) , cerebrovascular disease<disease> , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , or nonfatal peripheral arterial disease<disease>. Secondary endpoints were fatal and nonfatal coronary events , renal events ( defined as doubling of serum creatinine , ≥ 50 % decrease in eGFR , or renal replacement therapy) , and bleeding episodes. During follow-up , 17 and 5 participants suffered from a primary endpoint in the control and aspirin groups , respectively. Aspirin did not significantly reduce primary composite endpoint ( HR , 0.396 ( 0.146-1.076) , p = 0.069. Eight patients suffered from a fatal or nonfatal coronary event in the control group compared to no patients in the aspirin group. Aspirin significantly reduced the risk of coronary events ( log-rank , 5.997; p = 0.014). Seventeen patients in the control group reached the renal outcome in comparison with 3 patients in the aspirin group. Aspirin treatment decreased renal disease<disease> progression in a model adjusted for age , baseline kidney function , and diabetes mellitus ( HR , 0.272; 95 % CI , 0.077-0.955; p = 0.043) but did not when adjusted for albuminuria. No differences were found in minor bleeding episodes between groups and no major bleeding was registered. Small sample size and open-label trial. Long-term treatment with low-dose aspirin did not reduce the composite primary endpoint; however , there were reductions in secondary endpoints with fewer coronary events and renal outcomes.
