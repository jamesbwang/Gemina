 Regression to the mean ( RTM) can occur whenever an extreme observation is selected from a population and a later observation is closer to the population mean. A consequence of this phenomenon is that natural variability can be mistaken as real change. Simple expressions are available to quantify RTM when the underlying distribution is bivariate normal. However , there are many real-world situations , which are better approximated as a Poisson process. Examples include the number of hard disk failures<symptom> during a year , the number of cargo ships damaged by waves , daily homicide counts in California , and the number of deaths per quarter attributable to acquired immune deficiency syndrome<symptom> in Australia. In this paper , we derive expressions for quantifying RTM effects for the bivariate Poisson distribution for both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases. Statistical properties of our derivations have been evaluated through a simulation study. The asymptotic distributions of RTM estimators have been derived. The RTM effect for the number of people killed in road accidents in different regions of New South Wales ( Australia) is estimated using maximum likelihood.
