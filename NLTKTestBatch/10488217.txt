 Schizophyllum<pathogen> commune<pathogen> , a basidiomycetous fungus , is a common invader of rotten wood. This fungus rarely causes mycotic disease<disease> in humans , especially cutaneous<disease> infection<disease>. In this paper , we describe the first case of cutaneous granuloma<disease> caused by S.<pathogen> commune<pathogen> in a Chinese woman. A 25-year-old female with a two-year history of erythema , papules , nodules<disease> , and scales on her sole of left foot was presented to our outpatient center. Samples were obtained by the scraping of lesion<symptom> and for light microscopy. Hyphae were observed by microscopic examination. We carried out a skin tissue biopsy , which showed multiple granulomatous nodules<disease>. Biopsy specimens were also inoculated onto media. After being cultured on SDA at 27 Â°C for 7 days , spreading-woolly-white colonies grew on the inoculation sites of media containing chloramphenicol only and there We describe the first case of cutaneous granuloma<disease> caused by Schizophyllum<pathogen> commune<pathogen> , which illustrates the importance of recognizing uncommon pathogenic fungal infections.
