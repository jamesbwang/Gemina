 Appendiceal duplication is a rare congenital anomaly with an estimated incidence ranging from 0.004 to 0.009 %. Preoperative diagnosis of a duplicated appendix is often difficult and is usually done intraoperatively. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen is mandatory to confirm the presence of two appendices. In this case we report a female patient with acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in one of her two appendices. Surgeons should always bear in mind this rare anomaly to avoid serious ethical and legal consequences.
