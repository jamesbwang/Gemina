 The mechanism by which tumors escape the immune system has been actively investigated and is partly explained by the programmed death-1 ( PD-1) and its ligand ( PD-L1) pathway. This study is aimed at clarifying the prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression in patients with surgically resected pulmonary metastases of head<disease> and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC). A retrospective review was conducted of 26 HNSCC patients who underwent complete resection of pulmonary metastases. PD-L1 expression in both the primary and metastatic tumors was evaluated using immunohistochemistry ( anti-PD-L1 antibody , clone SP263). High PD-L1 expression was defined as â‰¥ 50 % of tumor cells with positive staining. Survival and prognostic impacts following pulmonary metastasectomy were analyzed based on the PD-L1 expression level. The patients included 23 men and 3 women , with a median age of 65 years. Six ( 23 %) of the pulmonary metastatic cases showed high PD-L1 expression , while their corresponding primary lesions<symptom> had low PD-L1 expression. The 5-year overall survival rate after pulmonary metastasectomy was 57.6 % in all cases. The 5-year overall survival rates were 72.5 % and 16.7 % in the low and high PD-L1 groups , respectively ( p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high PD-L1 expression and older age ( > 65 years) correlated independently with a shorter overall survival ( p < 0.001). High PD-L1 expression in pulmonary metastases could be an independent predictor of poor outcome in HNSCC patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy. This is the first report evaluating the prognostic implication of PD-L1 expression in metastatic HNSCC.
