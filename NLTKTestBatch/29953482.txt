 Skeletal muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> has been shown to be associated with hyperphosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor 1 at serine 2843 ( pRyR1Ser2843) , due to chronic overloading exercise. We investigated whether pRyR1Ser2843 , is a mechanism relevant for muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> also under acute , in contrast to chronic , muscle loading. 24 male subjects ( age: 24,8 ± 3,8; height: 182,8 ± 7,2 cm; weight<symptom>: 82,5 ± 9,9 kg) were evenly ( n = 6) assigned to the following four different resistance exercise ( RE) groups: hypertrophy- ( HYP) , strength endurance- ( SE) , maximum power- ( MAX) at the subjects ' 10 , 25 and 3 repetition maximum , respectively , and low intensity ( LI) RE with 70 % of the 10 repetition maximum. Each group completed three different RE volumes ( 1 set , 5 , and 10 sets). Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken before and after exercise , analyzed for pRyR1Ser2843 and examined for association with RE-induced muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> which was determined as reduction in maximum isometric force ( isoFmax) in the quadriceps femoris muscle also before and after exercise.The degree of RE-induced muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> was specific in terms of set volume as well as of RE mode. isoFmax was not reduced in any group after one set of RE. Five sets led to a significant reduction of isoFmax in HYP and SE but not in LI and MAX ( p < 0,05). Ten sets of RE , as compared to five sets , exclusively induced further muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> in LI. In terms of RE mode differences , isoFmax reduction was generally higher in HYP and SE than in MAX and Li after five and ten sets of RE ( p < 0,05). However , pRyR1Ser2843 did not show any significant regulation , regardless of exercise condition. We conclude that despite its relevance in reducing muscle contractility in chronic overloading , pRyR1Ser2843 does not reflect the degree of muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> exerted by acute hypertrophy- , strength endurance- , maximum power and low intensity-oriented exercise.
