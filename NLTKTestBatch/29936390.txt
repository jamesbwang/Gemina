 Previous research has suggested that individuals tend to become more religious with age. Research has also shown that as individuals become more religious , they report decreases in depressive symptoms<symptom> , suggesting that increased levels of religiosity might help to improve one 's mental health. The following study aimed to examine the effect of age on the relation between religiosity and depressive symptoms<symptom>. Data was gathered using a religiosity questionnaire and depression<symptom> questionnaire. The sample consisted of 201 adults , ranging from 21-67 years of age , recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk ( MTURK) marketplace. Hays ' PROCESS model for SPSS ( Hayes , 2013) was used to test age as a moderator between depressive symptoms<symptom> and religiosity. Correlations showed that religiosity was positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms<symptom>. Further analysis of the data suggested that age serves as a moderator in the relation between religiosity and depressive symptoms<symptom> for both middle-aged and younger adults. Participants included in the study were limited in age , further studies should consider including individuals > 67 years of age to better test proposed relations. High levels of religiosity were related to lower levels of depression<symptom> in middle-aged and younger adults. Though further research on the development of such evidence-based programs is needed , involvement in religious activities may have a preventative role in both the development and duration of depressive symptoms<symptom> in middle and older aged adults.
