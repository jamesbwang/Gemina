 Exposure to particulate matter ( PM) is associated with hospitalizations due to respiratory<disease> diseases<disease>diseases<disease> among children. An ecological time series study was carried out to identify the role of coarse fractions of particulate matter ( PM10-2.5) in hospitalizations among children up to 10 years of age , in Piracicaba ( SP) in the year 2015. A generalized additive model of Poisson regression was used to estimate the risk of hospitalization due to acute laryngitis and tracheitis<disease> , pneumonia<disease> , bronchitis<symptom> , bronchiolitis<disease> and asthma. Lags of 0 to 7 days were considered , and the model was adjusted for the temperature and relative humidity of the air and controlled for short and long-term exposure. Proportional attributable ratios , population-attributable fractions and hospital costs were calculated with increasing concentrations of these pollutants. 638 hospitalizations were evaluated during this period , with a mean of 1.75 cases per day ( standard deviation , SD = 1.86). The daily averages were 22.45 µg/m3 ( SD = 13.25) for the coarse fraction ( PM10-2.5) and 13.32 µg/m3 ( SD = 6.38) for the fine fraction. Significant risks of PM10-2.5 exposure were only observed at lag 0 , with relative risk ( RR) = 1.012 , and at lag 6 , with RR = 1.011. An increase of 5 µg/m3 in the coarse fraction concentration implied an increase in the relative risk of hospitalizations of up to 4.8 % , with an excess<symptom> of 72 hospitalizations and excess expenditure of US$ 17,000 per year. This study showed the impact of coarse-fraction exposure on hospital admissions among children due to respiratory<disease> diseases<disease>diseases<disease>.
