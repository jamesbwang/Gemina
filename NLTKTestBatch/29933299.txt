 Foam sclerotherapy is an effective treatment strategy for venous malformations ( VMs). Stability is one of the characteristics of sclerosant foams that determine the sclerosing power. To evaluate the clinical outcomes of sclerotherapy with prolonged half-life of hyaluronic acid ( HA)- polidocanol ( POL) foam for treating head<disease> and neck VMs. Seventy patients with head<disease> and neck VMs were enrolled between October 2013 and January 2015 in Qilu Hospital Shandong University. Sclerotherapy was performed with prolonged half-life POL foam by addition of 0.05 % HA. All patients were followed up at 1 , 3 , and 6 months. Reviews on the site and size of the lesion<symptom> , times and duration of treatments , therapeutic response , and complications were performed to evaluate the end result. Sites of lesions<symptom> included face , bucca , parotid<symptom> region , neck , tongue , floor of mouth<symptom> , lip , forehead , palate , and nose. An overall average of 2.5 treatments was required. Total response rate was 100 %. `` Resolution '' was achieved in 21 cases ( 30 %) and a significant response in 49 patients ( 70 %). Immediate swelling was the most common complication. Epidermal extravasation was seen in 1 patient. Mucosal ulcer<disease><symptom> was observed in 1 patient. No generalized complications occurred. The prolonged half-life of HA-POL foam sclerotherapy of VMs in the head<disease> and neck is safe and effective.
