 Copper-containing composite is a cupric ions release system to prepare a novel copper intrauterine devices ( Cu-IUDs) , its biocompatibility and weight<symptom> of the prepared composite Cu-IUDs are directly relevant to its such side-effects as pain and bleeding. To improve its biocompatibility and reduce its weight<symptom> of such a composite Cu-IUDs , a copper-containing composite based on polymer alloy of poly ( ethylene oxide) ( PEO) and low-density polyethylene ( LDPE) is developed. Here the role of its PEO in this novel cupric ions release system is reported. The results show that its cupric ions release rate can be adjusted easily by only changing its PEO content , and it increases remarkably with the increase of its PEO content. Our study also show that this influence is caused by the improvement of its hydrophilicity and the formation of its porous structure owing to the introduction of PEO. The improvement of its hydrophilicity make it easier for the surrounding aqueous solution to infiltrate into the composite , and the formation of its porous structure provide more routes for entry of the aqueous solution and diffusion of the released cupric ions. All these results indicate that the Cu/PEO/LDPE composite is a potential material that can be used to prepare such cupric ions release micro-devices as Cu-IUDs with slighter side-effects through its smaller weight<symptom>.
