 Remote ischaemic preconditioning ( RIPC) has been suggested as a means of protecting vital organs from reperfusion injury during major vascular surgery. This study was designed to determine whether RIPC could reduce the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction ( MI) during open surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( AAA). Secondary aims were to see if RIPC could reduce 30-day mortality , multiple<symptom> organ<symptom> failure<symptom> , acute intestinal ischaemia , acute kidney injury and ischaemic stroke. This randomized , non-blinded clinical trial was undertaken at three vascular surgery centres in Denmark. Patients who had open surgery for ruptured AAA were randomized to intervention with RIPC or control in a 1: 1 ratio. Postoperative complications and deaths were registered , and ECG and blood samples were obtained daily during the hospital stay. Of 200 patients randomized , 142 ( 72 RIPC , 70 controls) were included. There was no difference in rates of perioperative MI between the RIPC and control groups ( 36 versus 43 per cent respectively) , or in rates of organ<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , in the per-protocol analysis 30-day mortality was significantly reduced in the RIPC group ( odds ratio 0 路 46 , 95 per cent c.i. 0 路 22 to 0 路 99; P = 0 路 048). RIPC did not reduce the incidence of perioperative MI in patients undergoing open surgery for ruptured AAA. Registration number: NCT00883363 ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).
