 Children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions are at increased risk of psychological problems , particularly anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> , and they have limited access to evidence-based treatment for these issues. Biofeedback interventions may be useful for treating symptoms<symptom> of both psychological and physical conditions. A systematic review of studies of biofeedback interventions that addressed anxiety<symptom> or depression<symptom> in this population was undertaken via MEDLINE , EMBASE , PsycINFO , CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. Primary outcomes included changes in anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms<symptom> and ` caseness '. Secondary outcomes included changes in symptoms<symptom> of the associated physical condition and acceptability of the biofeedback intervention. Of 1876 identified citations , 9 studies ( 4 RCTs , 5 non-RCTs; of which all measured changes in anxiety<symptom> and 3 of which measured changes in depression<symptom>) were included in the final analysis and involved participants aged 8-25 years with a range of long-term physical conditions. Due to the heterogeneity of study design and reporting , risk of bias was judged as unclear for all studies and meta-analysis of findings was not undertaken. Within the identified sample , multiple modalities of biofeedback including heart rate variability ( HRV) , biofeedback assisted relaxation therapy and electroencephalography were found to be effective in reducing symptoms<symptom> of anxiety<symptom>. HRV was also found to be effective in reducing symptoms<symptom> of depression<symptom> in two studies. A range of modalities was effective in improving symptoms<symptom> of long-term physical conditions. Two studies that assessed acceptability provided generally positive feedback. There is currently limited evidence to support the use of biofeedback interventions for addressing anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions. Although promising , further research using more stringent methodology and reporting is required before biofeedback interventions can be recommended for clinical use instead or in addition to existing evidence-based modalities of treatment.
