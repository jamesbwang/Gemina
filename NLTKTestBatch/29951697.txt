 RNA binding proteins ( RBPs) can regulate the stability , localization , and translation of their target mRNAs. Among them , Puf3p is a well-known Pumilio<pathogen> family RBP whose biology has been intensively studied. Nevertheless , the impact of Puf3p on the translational regulation of its downstream genes still remains to be investigated at the genome-wide level. In this study , we combined ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq in budding yeast ( Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen>) to investigate Puf3p 's functions in translational regulation. Comparison of translational efficiency ( TE) between wild-type and puf3Î” strains demonstrates extensive translational modulation in the absence of Puf3p ( over 27 % genes are affected at the genome level). Besides confirming its known role in regulating mitochondrial metabolism , our data demonstrate that Puf3p serves as a key post-transcriptional regulator of downstream RBPs by regulating their translational efficiencies , indicating a network of interactions among RBPs at the post-transcriptional level. Furthermore , Puf3p switches the balance<symptom> of translational flux between mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosome biogenesis to adapt to changes in cellular metabolism. In summary , our results indicate that TE can be utilized as an informative index to interrogate the mechanism underlying RBP functions , and provide novel insights into Puf3p 's mode-of-action.
