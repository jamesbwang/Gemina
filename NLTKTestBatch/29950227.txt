 To compare the pharmaco-economic effect of 3 chemotherapeutic regimens in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma ( MM). One hundred and thirty-eight newly diagnosed cases of MM in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively , and then MM patients were divided into group A , B and C group according to therapeutic regimen. Group A was treated with VCD therapeutic regimen ( bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone , 63 cases) , The patients in group B was treated with BiCTD therapeutic regimen ( clarithromycin + cyclophosphamide + thalidomide + dexamethasone , 44 cases) , The patients in group C was treated with CTD therapeutic regimen ( cyclophosphamide + thalidomide + dexamethasone , 33 cases). The clinical efficacy , adverse reaction , cost-effectiveness were observed and analysed after 4 courses of treatment among 3 groups. The overall response rates of group A , B and C were 96.83 % , 81.82 % and 64.52 % with statistical significant difference ( P < 0.01). The high efficiency response rates of 3 groups were 82.5 % , 59.09 % , 32.26 % with very significant statistical difference ( P < 0.01). The infection<disease> rate of group A was statistically and significantly higher than other 2 groups ( P = 0.048) , and the constipation<symptom> rate in group A was statistically and significantly higer than that in group B and C ( P < 0.05). The cost-effectiveness ratios of 3 groups were 69567.44 , 20765.12 and 21475.48 , respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of group A and B were 183933.21 and 22259.09 , as compared with group C. The result was in accordance with sensitivity test. Clinicial efficacy of group A is the best , but group B has advantages on cost-effectiveness ratio as compared with other groups , otherwise , group B has low incidence of adverse reaction. In the view of safety , therapeutic efficacy and pharmacoeconomics for treatment of patients with MM , the BiCTD regimen has been confirmed to be superior to the other 2 groups.
