 Psoriasis is a very prevalent systemic chronic inflammatory<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease>. Major cardiovascular events are the main cause of mortality in these patients which suggests an association between psoriasis and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Identify classic cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome<symptom> ( MS) in patients with psoriasis , their possible association with its severity and compare it with the non-psoriatic population. This is an observational and cross-sectional population study in Lleida ( Spain) from a joint hospital/ primary care database. The database comprised 398,701 individuals. There were 6,868 cases registered as psoriasis ( 1.7 %) , and 499 of them ( 7.3 %) were classified as moderate-severe psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis had a higher prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors than non-psoriatic population: diabetes mellitus 2 ( 13.9 % vs 7.4 % , OR 2.01) , dyslipidemia ( 28.8 % vs 17.4 % , OR 1.92) , arterial hypertension ( 31.2 % vs 19.0 % , OR 1.93) , obesity ( 33.7 % vs 28.1 % , OR 1.30) , altered fasting basal glycaemia ( 21.4 % vs 15.1 % , OR 1.54) , low cholesterol-HDL ( 38.1 % vs 32.3 % , OR 1.29) , hypertriglyceridemia ( 45.7 % vs 35.2 % , OR 1.55) and high waist circumference ( 75.7 % vs 72.3 % , OR 1.19). MS was more prevalent in psoriatic patients ( 28.3 % vs 15.1 % , OR 2.21) and cardiovascular risk factors were similar between psoriasis severity groups. Psoriatic patients had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease<disease> ( 3.3 % vs 1.8 % , OR 1.87) and vascular-cerebral accidents ( 1.8 % vs 1.2 % , OR 1.55). A model for MS showed a significant non-linear relationship with age and sex , and significant differences between patients with and without psoriasis. We found statistically differences in relation to the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors , MS and major cardiovascular events in psoriatic patients. However , differences were not seen between psoriasis severity groups. Our work reinforces the need for a multidisciplinary approach and close monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors in these patients to prevent a cardiovascular event.
