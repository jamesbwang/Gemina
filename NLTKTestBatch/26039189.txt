 Maternal depression<symptom> may affect child feeding practice which is an important determinant of child nutritional status. The objective of this study was to explore the association between maternal depression<symptom> and WHO complementary feeding indicators ( minimum dietary diversity ( MDD) , minimum meal frequency ( MMF) and minimum acceptable diet ( MAD)) or stunting status of children ( 6-23 months) in Tamale Metropolis , Ghana. A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out involving 200 mother-child pairs randomly sampled from three communities in Tamale Metropolis , Ghana. The prevalence of MDD , MMF , and MAD were 56.5 , 65.0 , and 44.0 % respectively and 41.0 % of the children sampled were stunted. A third of the mothers ( 33.5 %) screened positive for depression<symptom>. Maternal depression<symptom> did not influence significantly MDD ( p = 0.245) , MMF ( p = 0.442) , and MAD ( p = 0.885) or children 's risk of stunting ( p = 0.872). In conclusion maternal depression<symptom> and child stunting are prevalent in Northern Ghana but there is a lack of evidence of an association between maternal depression<symptom> and child feeding practices or nutritional status in this study population. Further research is needed to assess the effect of maternal depression<symptom> on feeding practices and growth of young children.
