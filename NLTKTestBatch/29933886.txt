 Immune checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1 , anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 have been in development in several indications and have changed the face of cancer patients ' management. Cancer immunotherapy was central in ASCO 's meeting 2017. The identification of patients who could benefit most from immune checkpoint inhibitors is essential. The predictive value of PD-L1 status<symptom> remains insufficient to select patients who could respond to immunotherapy. An extended search for new biomarkers predictive of response ( INF-Î³ , mutational load) is ongoing , in order to better select responders. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have mainly been developed as monotherapy. However , the low response rate , between 10 and 30 % , and the occurrence of resistance , contributes to the increment of new therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes the results of combination trials of two immune checkpoint inhibitors , combination of immunotherapy with conventional chemotherapy , radiotherapy or targeted therapies active on the oncogenic addiction pathway.
