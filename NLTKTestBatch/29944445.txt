 Pattern recognition receptors ( PRR) are plasma membrane ( PM) proteins that recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns ( MAMPs) , triggering an immune response. PRR are classified as receptor like kinases ( RLKs) or receptor like proteins ( RLPs). The PM localization of PRRs , which is crucial for their availability to sense MAMPs , depends on their appropriate trafficking through the endomembrane system. Recently , we have identified SlPRA1A , a prenylated RAB acceptor type-1 ( PRA1) from S. lycopersicum , as a regulator of RLP-PRR localization and protein levels. SlPRA1A overexpression strongly decreases RLP-PRR protein levels , particularly those of LeEIX2 , redirecting it to the vacuole for degradation. Interestingly , SlPRA1A does not affect RLK-PRRs , indicating its activity to be specific to RLP-PRR systems. As PRA1 proteins stabilize RABs on membranes<symptom> , promoting RABs activity , we aimed to identify a RAB target of SlPRA1A. Screening of a set of A. thaliana RABs revealed that AtRABA1e is able to mimic SlPRA1A activity. Through live cell imaging , we observed that SlPRA1A enhances AtRABA1e localization on SlPRA1A positive punctuated structures. These results indicate that AtRABA1e is a putative target of SlPRA1 , and a co-regulator of LeEIX2 trafficking and degradation.
