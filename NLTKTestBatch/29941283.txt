 Among the procedures for severe gonarthrosis , total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) is considered a successful method patient satisfaction and functional improvement; however , TKA is commonly associated with incompletely recovered gait function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of TKA and physiotherapy programmes on gait features and patient-reported functional status and the relationship between them , leading to broader knowledge of the origins of long-term gait disturbances. Walking speed , step length and single support time were analysed by GAITRite system in 60 healthy controls and 21 TKA patients analysed at four time points: one day before and five days after surgery and before and after a three-week rehabilitation ( 12 and 15 weeks after surgery). Functional status was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC). At all time points , the TKA subjects walked significantly slower than the controls , but walking speed continuously increased after surgery. Gait asymmetries were observed in single support time ( before surgery) and step length ( after surgery). Partial restoration of gait function was observed 12 weeks after surgery and completion of the rehabilitation programme. An indirect correlation between gait velocity and function WOMAC subscores was found. Patients after TKA were characterised by significant improvements in self-reported functionality and progressive reduction of gait abnormalities , probably related to pain<symptom> reduction. However , at 15 weeks after surgery , patients exhibited step length asymmetry , which could be considered as an effect of habits of three-point crutch gait in the early postoperative period.
