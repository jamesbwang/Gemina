 On 20 June 2015 , a cholera<disease> outbreak affecting more than 30 people was reported in a fishing village , Katwe , in Kasese District , south-western Uganda. We investigated this outbreak to identify the mode of transmission and to recommend control measures. We defined a suspected case as onset of acute watery diarrhoea<disease> between 1 June and 15 July 2015 in a resident of Katwe village; a confirmed case was a suspected case with Vibrio<pathogen> cholerae<pathogen> cultured from stool<symptom>. For case finding , we reviewed medical records and actively searched for cases in the community. In a case-control investigation we compared exposure histories of 32 suspected case-persons and 128 age-matched controls. We also conducted an environmental assessment on how the exposures had occurred. We found 61 suspected cases ( attack rate = 4.9/ 1000) during this outbreak , of which eight were confirmed. The primary case-person had onset on 16 June; afterwards cases sharply increased , peaked on 19 June , and rapidly declined afterwards. After 22 June , eight scattered cases occurred. The case-control investigation showed that 97 % ( 31/32) of cases and 62 % ( 79/128) of controls usually collected water from inside a water-collection site `` X '' ( ORM-H = 16; 95 % CI = 2.4-107). The primary case-person who developed symptoms<symptom> while fishing , reportedly came ashore in the early morning hours on 17 June , and defecated `` near '' water-collection site X. We concluded that this cholera<disease> outbreak was caused by drinking lake water collected from inside the lakeshore water-collection site X. At our recommendations , the village administration provided water chlorination tablets to the villagers , issued water boiling advisory to the villagers , rigorously disinfected all patients ' faeces and , three weeks later , fixed the tap-water system.
