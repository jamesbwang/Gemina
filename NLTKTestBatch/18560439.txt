 Although high rate of curcumin consumption has been suggested to decrease the prevalence of Alzheimer 's disease<disease> ( AD) , its administration has no effect on the progression of AD in humans and this has been attributed to its poor bioavailability. Using nanotechnology to break down curcumin increases its bioavailability and improves its effect on the brain. BSA , as a non-toxic protein with high binding capacity , was used to break curcumin to nanosize and to explore the effect of nanocurcumin on passive avoidance memory and hippocampal MMP-2 and -9 and MAPKs. BSA-based nanocurcumin was produced by desolvation method. In this study , 15 and 20 mg/kg/p.o. nanocurcumin ( based on our preliminary studies) were administered to male NMRI mice weighing 20-25 g for 10 days. Passive avoidance training was performed on day 10 and 24 h after , a retention<symptom> trial was done. Upon completion of behavioral studies , the hippocampi were isolated and western blot analysis was performed on MMP-2 , MMP-9 , and MAPKs ( JNK , ERK , and p38). The results showed that BSA-based nanocurcumin administered at 15 and 20 mg/kg doses resulted in a significantly improved performance in passive avoidance memory test while its equivalent doses of natural curcumin did not produce a similar effect. In addition , this effect was accompanied with an increase in MMP-2 , MMP-9 , and p-ERK and a decrease in p-JNK. This study indicates that breaking curcumin to nanosize produces improved effects on passive avoidance memory in adult mice accompanied with MMP-2 , MMP-9 , p-ERK , and p-JNK changes in the hippocampus.
