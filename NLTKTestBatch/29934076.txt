 To improve knowledge and raise awareness of nurses who assist certified registered nurse anesthetists or anesthesiologists with peripheral nerve block or spinal block procedures about a potential life-threatening local anesthetic systemic toxicity ( LAST) event. An evidence-based practice project design. Nurses in units where nerve block procedures were performed ( ie , postanesthesia care unit , preoperative , operating room , outpatient services , labor and delivery unit) received a pretest about their knowledge of LAST events , participated in a 30-minute educational session , and then completed a post-test. The data were analyzed for differences and statistical significance. Included in the test was a question about the nurse 's comfort level with managing a LAST event. The findings demonstrated a knowledge deficit related to LAST events. The average of all three units combined pretest scores was 60 % and post-test scores increased to 95 %. The average comfort level of all three units was 3.5/ 10 ( 35 %) before the educational in-service program and increased to 7.9/ 10 ( 79 %) after education. Nurses working in units where nerve blocks are performed are lacking in knowledge of the signs and symptoms<symptom> and the correct course of treatment for a LAST event. This could lead to poor outcomes of a very high-risk low-volume event.
