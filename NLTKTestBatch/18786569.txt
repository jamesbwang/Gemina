 Preservation of plant virus<pathogen> is a fundamental requirement in all types of virus-related research and applied applications. Development of efficient , reliable strategies for long-term preservation of plant virus<pathogen> would largely assist these studies. The present study reported a novel biotechnology allowing cryopreservation of Apple stem grooving virus<pathogen> ( ASGV) in living shoot tips. Following cryopreservation by droplet-vitrification or encapsulation-dehydration , about 62-67 % of shoot regrowth and 100 % of ASGV cryopreservation were obtained. Although shoot proliferation and virus<pathogen> concentration were reduced in cryopreserved diseased shoots after 8 weeks of shoot regeneration , continuous subculture for 4 times ( 16 weeks) increased shoot proliferation and virus<pathogen> concentration to comparative levels as those produced by shoot tip culture ( as a control to shoot tip cryopreservation). Cryopreserved ASGV was efficiently transmitted to a woody plant by micrografting and to a herbaceous indicator by mechanical inoculation. Gene sequencing in three fragments of ASGV genome including coat protein and<symptom> movement<symptom> protein showed that cryopreserved ASGV shared 99.87 % nucleotide identities with shoot tip culture-preserved virus<pathogen> , indicating cryopreserved virus<pathogen> is genetically stable. The present study demonstrates ASGV , a representative virus<pathogen> that can infect meristematic cells of shoot tips , can be efficiently cryopreserved in shoot tips. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report on plant virus<pathogen> cryopreservation in living tissues , and has great potential applications to long-term preservation of plant viruses<pathogen>.
