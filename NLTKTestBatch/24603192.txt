 BACKGROUND In symptomatic severe aortic stenosis ( AS) , the majority of patients have high gradient AS. However , some patients have an AS gradient less than 40 with a valve area under 1.0 cm ². For patients with a low gradient , severe AS is difficult to detect and requires a high index of suspicion. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) is currently recommended for patients with moderate<symptom> to high risk AS according to the Society of Thoracic Surgery ( STS) risk score. CASE REPORT Here we present the case of an 86-year-old female with recurrent pleural effusion<symptom> over the course of 2-year; she had multiple thoracentesis procedures and was being considered for a pleurodesis. Later the patient was found to have severe AS; an echocardiogram showed an aortic valve ( AV) area of 0.67 cm ² , AV mean gradient of 34 mmHg , and ejection fraction of 75 %. The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization and was treated with TAVR. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis was made after exclusion of all other causes of unilateral pleural effusion<symptom> and was confirmed by improvement of effusion<symptom> following the TAVR procedure.
