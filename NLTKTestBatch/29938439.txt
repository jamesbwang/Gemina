 of the oral cavity. It may develop as a congenital defect e.g. cleft palate , or rarely , consequent to an operative procedure like a sub muco-perichondrial resection surgery of the nasal septum. After nasal septal corrective surgery , follow up of the patient with meticulous nasal toilet and detailed examination is mandatory. In operated patients who do not report to follow up , and later on present with persisting nasal<symptom> discharge<symptom> , pain , nasal blockage and exsanguination must alert a clinician for any evidence of a possibly retained foreign object. Inadvertently retained nasal splints can cause long lasting morbidity due to a possible chronic sinusitis<disease> , toxic shock<symptom> syndrome<symptom> and palatal perforation.
