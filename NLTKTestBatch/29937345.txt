 To compare the clinical outcomes and return to sport rate between elite overhead athletes who underwent shoulder arthroscopy and decompression of the suprascapular nerve ( SSN) versus overhead athletes who underwent shoulder arthroscopy without SSN release. From 2007 to 2014 , high-level overhead athletes diagnosed with a rotator cuff tear and/or a glenoid labral lesion<symptom> and SSN entrapment were included in the study if their symptoms<symptom> did not improve with nonoperative treatment and if they agreed to undergo surgery and participate. Their preoperative University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA) shoulder score , bilateral postoperative Constant scores , postoperative UCLA score , and return to sport rate were evaluated and compared with those of a group of elite athletes who had a similar diagnosis but refused to undergo SSN decompression during shoulder arthroscopy. Thirty-five athletes ( 25 male , 10 female) were included in the SSN decompression group ( group 1) , and 21 athletes were included in the non-SSN decompression group ( group 2). The mean age was 27 years ( range: 19-34) and 24 years ( range: 21-32) in group 1 and group 2 , respectively ( P = .56). The mean follow-up time was 38.4 months ( 24-50 months) in group 1 and 42.2 months ( 26-53 months) in group 2 ( P = .09). Both groups had significantly improved UCLA scores after surgery ( P < .05). The postoperative UCLA ( P = .01) and Constant scores ( P < .001) were significantly higher in the SSN decompression group. The mean difference in Constant score between the affected and the unaffected side was 4 points ( range: 2-12) in the SSN decompression group and 8 points ( range: 4-14) in the non-SSN decompression group postoperatively ( P = .0002). In both groups , 100 % of patients reached the patient acceptable symptom<symptom> state value for Constant score at follow-up. For the UCLA score , patients who underwent SSN decompression had significantly higher pre- to postoperative improvement than the nondecompression group ( P = .016). The return to sport rate was 97 % in group 1 and 84 % in group 2. The mean length of career was 2.1 years ( range: 1.5-2.4 years) and 2.3 years ( range: 1.2-3.2 years) in group 1 and group 2 , respectively. In elite overhead athletes with shoulder pathology and SSN entrapment , combined shoulder arthroscopy and SSN release yield superior clinical outcomes , greater improvement in UCLA score , and a higher return to sport rate than shoulder arthroscopy without SSN decompression. Regardless of SSN treatment , both groups achieved the patient acceptable symptom<symptom> state after shoulder arthroscopy. Level III , comparative case series.
