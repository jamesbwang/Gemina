 Thrombocytopenia<symptom> occurs to approximately 8 % -10 % of pregnant women and this condition is a notable source of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. In the recent years , our comprehension of thrombocytopenia<symptom> has progressed on pregnancy. Nevertheless , there has not been adequate information about thrombocytopenia<symptom> outcomes in obstetric patients. With regard to this topic , we reviewed published reports as an update from the managements on these cases.

For this cause , we reviewed the management of pregnant patients with thrombocytopenia<symptom> treated over a period of 37 years.
