 IgG4-related disease<disease> ( IgG4-RD) and Castleman 's disease<disease> ( CD) share similar clinical manifestations. When the histopathology coincides with the diagnosis of both IgG4-RD and CD , it is hard to depart the two disease<disease> entities utterly; here we call it IgG4-CD provisionally. In this study , we aim to review the clinical features of IgG4-CD. This study is based on a retrospective analysis of a prospectively acquired database. IgG4-CD was defined histopathologically in patients who fulfilled the diagnosis of both IgG4-RD and CD. Forty-five definite IgG4-RD and 16 multicentric CD ( MCD) patients were recruited as controls. Clinical features including organ involvement , serum IgG4 , IgG , IgE , ESR , CRP , and IL-6 levels were collected and analyzed. Fifteen patients ( 2.8 %) out of 534 patients with IgG4-RD in China 's largest prospective IgG4-RD and Mimicry cohort fulfilled the definition of IgG4-CD. There were 14 males and 1 female , whose mean age was 47 Â± 18 years old , and the median disease<disease> duration before diagnosis was 12 ( 1-132) months. Eight patients have allergic disease<disease> history. IgG4-CD patients had more lymph node involvement ( 100 vs 57.8 % , P < 0.01) , while IgG4-RD patients had more submandibular ( 33.3 vs 77.1 % , P < 0.01) and parotid<symptom> gland ( 13.3 vs 40.9 % , P < 0.05) affected. IgG4-CD patients had significantly higher levels of ESR , CRP , IgG , IgG1 , IgG3 , IgG4 , and IgE than IgG4-RD patients. Compared with MCD patients , IgG4-CD patients showed higher incidence of salivary gland and paranasal sinus involvement , higher hemoglobin , eosinophil count , serum IgG4 level and IgG4/IgG ratio , and lower CRP , IL-6 levels , and IgG1/IgG , IgG2/IgG ratio. All patients with IgG4-CD exhibited relatively favorable outcomes. Both IgG4-RD and CD can involve multiple<symptom> organs. There are a small group of patients who had clinical and pathological characteristics of both CD and IgG4-RD showed better clinical outcome. In the long-term prognosis of these patients , the relationship of CD and IgG4-RD is waiting to be further elucidated.
