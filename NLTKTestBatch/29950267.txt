 Gastrointestinal fistulae<disease> are classified as enteroenteric or enterocutaneous. Most gastrointestinal fistulae<disease> are formed after surgical procedures for inflammatory bowel disease<disease> or malignancy. For spontaneous enteroenteric fistulae<disease> , ischemia has been reported as a possible etiology. We report two cases of spontaneous enteroenteric fistulae<disease> arising after bowel ischemia; a 38-year male with a 10-day history of severe abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> with fever<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> , and a 22-year female with a one-week history of abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and diarrhea<disease>. Arterial and venous thrombi in association with enteroenteric fistulae<disease> were identified on computed tomography. These cases point towards acute mesenteric ischemia as a rare cause of spontaneous enteroenteric fistulae<disease>. Surgical management of these fistulae<disease> can be effective in resolving this complication.
