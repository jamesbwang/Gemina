 The pathophysiological changes that occur in lungs infected with influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses<pathogen> are poorly understood. Here we established an in vivo imaging system that combines two-photon excitation microscopy and fluorescent influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses<pathogen> of different pathogenicity. This approach allowed us to monitor and correlate several parameters and physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> including the spread of infection , pulmonary permeability , pulmonary perfusion speed , number of recruited neutrophils in infected lungs , and neutrophil motion in the lungs of live mice. Several physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> were larger and occurred earlier in mice infected with a highly pathogenic H5N1<pathogen> influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> compared with those infected with a mouse-adapted human strain. These findings demonstrate the potential of our in vivo imaging system to provide novel information about the pathophysiological consequences of virus<pathogen> infections.
