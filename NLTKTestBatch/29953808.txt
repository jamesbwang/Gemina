 Cancer cells rely on the chaperone , heat shock<symptom> protein 70 ( Hsp70) , for survival and proliferation. Recently , benzothiazole-rhodacyanines have been shown to bind an allosteric site on Hsp70 , interrupting its binding to nucleotide-exchange factors ( NEFs) and promoting cell death in breast cancer cell lines. However , proof-of-concept molecules , such as JG-98 , have relatively modest potency ( EC50 ~ 0.7 to 0.4 µM) and are rapidly metabolized in animals. Here , we explored this chemical series through structure- and property-based design of ~ 300 analogs , showing that the most potent had > 10-fold improved EC50 values ( ~ 0.05 to 0.03 µM) against two breast cancer cells. Biomarkers and whole genome CRISPRi screens confirmed members of the Hsp70 family as cellular targets. Based on these results , JG-231 was found to reduce tumor burden in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft model ( 4 mg/kg; i.p.). Together , these studies support the hypothesis that Hsp70 may be a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics.
