 Diets high in saturated fat acids ( SFA) have been linked with cardio-metabolic disease<disease> risk. The purpose of this study was to determine whether only 1-2 weeks of a high SFA diet could impact disease<disease> risk factors in overweight adults who normally eat a relatively low proportion of SFA ( i.e. , < 40 % of dietary fat). Twelve overweight ( BMI: 27 ± 1 kg/m2) young adults were studied before and after a 2-week diet that increased the proportion of SFA ( < 40 % to 60 % of dietary fat) , while maintaining their daily intake of total fat , carbohydrate , protein , and calories. Insulin resistance , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , plasma markers of liver damage , total plasma cholesterol concentrations , and fatty acid profile within plasma and skeletal muscle lipid pools were assessed before and after the intervention. Total plasma cholesterol concentration increased ( 148 ± 5 vs. 164 ± 8 mg/dl; P < 0.05) after only one week , due exclusively to an increase in LDL-cholesterol ( 78 ± 4 vs. 95 ± 7 mg/dl; P < 0.05). After two weeks , plasma aspartate amino transferase ( AST) concentration increased ( P < 0.05) but we found no change in insulin resistance , or resting blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. The diet increase the proportion of SFA in plasma ( 35 ± 1 % vs. 39 ± 2 %; P < 0.05) and the intramyocellular triglyceride pool ( 32 ± 1 % vs. 37 ± 1 %; P < 0.05) suggesting the fatty acids in these pools may readily exchange. Although blood lipids remain within normal clinical range , increasing saturated fat in diet for only 2 weeks raises plasma markers of cardiovascular risk ( LDL-cholesterol) and liver damage ( AST). In overweight , but healthy-young adults SFA accumulate in plasma and muscle after only 1-2 weeks of dietary increase.
