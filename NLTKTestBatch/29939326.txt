 An experiment was conducted to determine the apparent ileal digestibility ( AID) of AA and starch and the standardized ileal digestibility ( SID) of AA in three varieties of hybrid rye and in one source of barley , wheat , and corn. Seven growing barrows ( initial BW = 26.1 ± 2.4 kg) were randomly allotted to a 7 × 7 Latin square design with seven periods and seven experimental diets. Six diets included one of the grains as the sole source of AA , and an N-free diet was used to determine basal endogenous losses<symptom> of CP and AA. In each period , ileal digesta were collected for 8 h on days 6 and 7 following a 5-d adaptation period. At the conclusion of the experiment , all ingredients , diets , and ileal digesta samples were analyzed for starch , CP , and AA. The AID of starch was greater ( P < 0.05) in wheat and corn than in barley or hybrid rye , but all grains had AID values for starch that were above 95 %. Wheat and barley contained more CP and indispensable AA than hybrid rye , but hybrid rye contained more indispensable AA compared with corn. The SID of CP and all indispensable AA was greater ( P < 0.05) in barley , wheat , and corn than in the three varieties of rye. However , because of the greater concentration of AA in hybrid rye than in corn , the quantities of standardized ileal digestible CP and AA were not different between corn and hybrid rye. In conclusion , hybrid rye has greater concentrations of most AA than corn , but the digestibility of AA in rye is less than in other cereal grains. It is likely that the reason for the reduced SID of AA in rye is that rye contains more fructans and soluble dietary fiber than other cereal grains , which may increase viscosity and reduce the efficiency of endogenous peptidases.
