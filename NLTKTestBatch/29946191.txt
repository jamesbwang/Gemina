 Rapid advances over the past decade have uncovered the heterogeneous genomic and immunologic landscape of myelodysplastic syndromes<symptom> ( MDS). This has led to notable improvements in the accuracy and timing of diagnosis and prognostication of MDS , as well as the identification of possible novel targets for therapeutic intervention. For the practicing clinician , however , this increase in genomic , epigenomic , and immunologic knowledge needs consideration in a `` real-world '' context to aid diagnostic specificity. Although the 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification for MDS is comprehensive and timely , certain limitations still exist for day-to-day clinical practice. In this review , we describe an up-to-date diagnostic approach to patients with suspected lower-risk MDS , including hypoplastic MDS , and demonstrate the requirement for an `` integrated '' diagnostic approach. Moreover , in the era of rapid access to massive parallel sequencing platforms for mutational screening , we suggest which patients should undergo such analyses , when such screening should be performed , and how those data should be interpreted. This is particularly relevant given the recent findings describing age-related clonal hematopoiesis.
