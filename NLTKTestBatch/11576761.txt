 In recent years , the environmental impact of artificial light at night has been a rapidly growing global problem , affecting 99 % of the population in the US and Europe , and 62 % of the world population. The present study utilized a mouse model exposed to long-term artificial light and light deprivation to explore the impact of these conditions on emotion and cognition. Based on the potential links between histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 ( HINT1) and mood disorders , we also examined the expression of HINT1 and related apoptosis factors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN) , prefrontal cortex ( PFC) , nucleus accumbens ( NAc) and hippocampus ( Hip). Mice exposed to constant light ( CL) exhibited depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors , as well as impaired spatial memory , as demonstrated by an increased immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swimming tests , less entries and time spent in the open arms<symptom> of elevated plus-maze , and less platform site crossings and time spent in the target quadrant<symptom> in the Morris water maze ( MWM). The effects of constant darkness ( CD) partially coincided with long-term illumination , except that mice in the CD group failed to show anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore , HINT1 was upregulated in four encephalic regions , indicating that HINT1 may be involved in mood disorders and cognitive impairments due to altered light exposure. The apoptosis-related proteins , BAX and BCL-2 , showed the opposite expression pattern , reflecting an activated apoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that exposure to CL and/or darkness can induce significant changes in affective and cognitive responses , possibly through HINT1-induced activation of apoptotic pathways.
