 Non-alcohol substance use disorders ( drug use disorders ( DUDs)) are common in trauma patients. To determine the test characteristics of a 4-item drug CAGE questionnaire to detect DUDs in a cohort of adult trauma inpatients. Observational cross-sectional cohort of 1,115 adult patients admitted directly to a level-one trauma center between September , 1994 and November , 1996. All participants underwent both a 4-item drug CAGE questionnaire and the substance use disorder section of a structured psychiatric diagnostic clinical interview ( SCID) ( DSM-IIIR criteria) , administered by staff unaware of their clinical status<symptom>. Sensitivity , specificity , positive ( PPV) and negative predictive values ( NPV) , positive ( LR +) and negative likelihood ratios ( LR-) , and the area under the receiver operating curve ( AUC) were calculated for each individual question and the overall questionnaire , using SCID-generated DUD diagnoses as the standard. Performance characteristics of the screen were also compared across selected sociodemographic , injury mechanism , and diagnostic sub-groups. Subjects with DUDs were common ( n = 349 , 31.3 %) , including cannabis ( n = 203 , 18.2 %) , cocaine ( n = 199 , 17.8 %) , and opioids ( n = 156 , 14.0 %). The screen performed well overall ( AUC = 0.90 , 95 % CI: 0.88-0.91) and across subgroups based on age , sex , race , marriage status<symptom> , income , education , employment status<symptom> , mechanism of injury , and current/past DUD status<symptom> ( AUCs 0.75-1.00). Answering any one question in the affirmative had a sensitivity = 83.4 % ( 95 % CI: 79.1-87.1) , specificity = 92.3 % ( 95 % CI: 90.2-94.1) , PPV = 83.1 % , LR + = 10.8. The 4-item drug CAGE and its individual questions had good-to-excellent ability to detect DUDs in this adult trauma inpatient population , suggesting its usefulness as a screening tool.
