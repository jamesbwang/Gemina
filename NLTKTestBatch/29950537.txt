 Myocardial infarction simultaneously involving two or more culprit lesions<symptom> is extremely rare and usually has a poor clinical outcomes including mortality. Management of this complicated condition is challenging and limited time. Nevertheless , autopsy studies revealed that thrombotic occlusion of more than one major epicardium coronary artery is not uncommon. A 68-year-old woman presented with sudden onset of limited breath and chest<symptom> discomfort<symptom> since two hours prior to admission. She also felt exert dyspnoea since one month ago. She has two risk factors that were uncontrolled that is hypertension ( HT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM). On admission , she succumbed into cardiogenic shock<symptom> and pulmonary oedema. ECG revealed a diminished R wave in V2-V4 with ST elevation in V2-V5 and in aVR. Biphasic T wave was seen in V2-V6. The working diagnosis was anterior STEMI , Killip class IV with thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI) score of 8. While being transferred to catheter lab , she gasped , became desaturation , and was intubated prior to procedure. The patient was given double inotropes which run maximally. By Coronary angiography , there were occlusions at the LAD and LCX. Stent was applied at proximal LAD and LCX. Subsequently , patient 's condition improved and post-procedure ECG showed improvement in aVR and precordial leads , and ST elevation was significantly diminished from V5 and aVR , and R wave came back in V2-V4. Previous study found around 50 % of STEMI patients had multi-vessels diseases<disease>. In this case , ECG suggested LAD region infarction with ST elevation in aVR , commonly associated with left main stenosis ( LMS) involvement.Thrombus aspiration in LAD and LCX yielded hemodynamic improvement. V-stenting technique , introduced in 1996 , allows delivery and implantation of 2 stents together , and therefore shorten the stent deployment time.
