 Platinum-based drugs are used extensively in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) , but their use can be limited by resistance. In this study , we established cisplatin ( DDP) resistant TNBC cells to investigate the potential relationship among ETS1 , IKKα/NF-κB and resistance. The sensitivity was evaluated by MTT , apoptosis analysis. The intracellular DDP concentration difference was tested by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS) method. Molecular pathological mechanism of DDP resistance was explored by microarray analysis and PPI network analysis. The ETS1 , NF-κB signaling change were assessed by western blot and q-PCR in vitro and vivo. The existing binds between ETS1 and the core IKKα promoter were found by luciferase assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation technique ( ChIP). MDA-MB-231/ DDP ( 231/DDP) cell had a higher IC This study enables us to understand the functions of ETS1 in TNBC chemotherapy and suggests that ETS1 could be used as a novel marker of poor<symptom> response<symptom> to DDP and a potential therapeutic target for TNBC chemotherapy.
