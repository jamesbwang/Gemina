 To explore associations of joint hypermobility ( a condition where range of motion is greater than normal) with ankle and foot radiographic osteoarthritis and symptoms<symptom> in a large community-based cohort of African American and Caucasian adults 55-94 years old. Ankle and foot radiographs and joint hypermobility data ( Beighton Criteria) were available for 848 participants ( 2003-2010) in this cross-sectional study. General joint hypermobility was defined as a Beighton score â‰¥ 4 ( range 0-9); knee hypermobility was defined as hyperextension of at least one knee. Standing anteroposterior and lateral foot radiographs were read with standard atlases for Kellgren-Lawrence grade , osteophytes and joint space narrowing at the tibiotalar joint and for osteophytes and joint space narrowing to define osteoarthritis at five foot joints. Ankle or foot symptoms<symptom> were self-reported. Separate person-based logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of ankle and foot osteoarthritis and symptom<symptom> outcomes with hypermobility measures , adjusting for age , sex , race , body mass index , and history of ankle/foot injury. This sample was: 68 % women and 33 % African American; mean age = 71 years; mean body mass index = 31 kg/m Knee joint hypermobility may be related to talonavicular osteoarthritis and to ankle and foot symptoms<symptom>.
