 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<disease> ( COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Common in COPD are acute exacerbations ( AE-COPD) that cause acute<symptom> dyspnea<symptom> , cough<symptom> , and bronchospasm. Symptoms<symptom> of AE-COPD mimic pulmonary embolism ( PE). We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the prevalence of PE in patients admitted to the hospital with a clinical diagnosis of AE-COPD. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines , we queried PubMed and MEDLINE databases from 1990 to 2017. The search term `` prevalence pulmonary embolism , COPD '' was used , and Boolean operators were used to combine search terms. Data were extracted from each article , specifically the sample size , study setting , design , and the prevalence of PE. A total of 5 articles were included that demonstrated a prevalence of PE among patients with a clinical diagnosis of AE-COPD that ranged from 3.3-29.1 %. Sample sizes varied from 49-197 patients. Studies occurred in both emergency department and inpatient settings , including intensive care units. Among the studies that reported patient characteristics associated with PE in AE-COPD , both obesity and immobility were important. Studies reporting the prevalence of PE during AE-COPD vary considerably in their methods and results. Because of the relatively high prevalence of PE during AE-COPD , it is important for providers to be aware of this linkage between the 2 conditions and to screen patients using clinical gestalt and validated screening tools until more emergency department data are available.
