 Inflammatory pseudotumor is a histologically proven benign tumor like lesion<symptom> of unknown etiopathogenesis. It is less commonly found in central nervous system and least common in spinal canal. Among them spinal epidural inflammatory pseudotumor is a rarely reported entity. We report here a case who presented with paraplegia<symptom> having a spinal epidural mass which was diagnosed as inflammatory pseudotumor after surgical excision followed by histopathology. It was a radiological dilemma; hence complete excision was required for diagnosis and better outcome of the patient.
