 Restoration of physiological alignment of the distal tibia and thereby restoration of physiological loading of the ankle joint; joint preservation in asymmetric degenerative arthritis<disease><symptom> of the ankle. Congenital deformities of the distal tibia; acquired deformities of the distal tibia; asymmetric degenerative arthritis<disease><symptom> with partially preserved cartilage. Absolute contraindications comprise severe nicotine abuse , Charcot arthropathy , peripheral polyneuropathy , relevant peripheral arterial vessel disease<disease> , poor local soft<disease> tissue condition , acute<disease> infection<disease> and extensive cartilage damage grade 3-4 in the Outerbridge classification in the complete joint. Medial and lateral open and closed wedge osteotomies and dome osteotomies of the distal tibia are used , and shortening , lengthening and derotating osteotomies of the fibula. For 6 weeks , 15-20 kg partial weight-bearing in a below knee cast or a walker orthosis; full weight-bearing depending on osseous healing after 9-12 weeks postoperatively. Between July 2012 and May 2017 , 15 patients ( 10 men , 5 women) underwent a supramalleor osteotomy. Average age was 41.8 years ( range 17-63 years) and the retrospective average follow-up was 28.7 months ( range 3-47 months). Mean preoperative AOFAS ( American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) hindfoot score was 54.3 ( range 26-86) and postoperatively a mean of 74.2 ( 44-100). Preoperatively , 9 patients had varus malalignment and 6 patients valgus malalignment; overall , 4 patients developed complications requiring surgical intervention ( 26.7 %). Osteosynthetic material was removed in 60 % of the patients.
