 Breast cancer is one of the most common female `` malignancies '' reported worldwide in recent years. This study is aimed to understand the degree of acceptance of breast reconstruction among breast cancer patients in Chinese women and to explore the related factors. Breast cancer patients were asked to fill in the demographic questionnaire , and consent for evaluation of Breast Reconstruction Acceptance Scale , Social Support Scale , and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-breast Quality of Life Instrument ( FACT-B). The data were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis for the correlations between the degree of acceptance of breast reconstruction and age , marital status<symptom> , family monthly income , quality of life , and social support. 57.5 % of 715 patients were not familiar with breast reconstruction. Results showed correlation with the degree of acceptance of breast reconstruction. Multivariate analysis indicated that age ( 41-50 years old , OR: 0.25 , 95 % CI: 0.08-0.76; > 50 , OR: 0.05 , 95 % CI: 0.02-0.15) , marital status<symptom> ( married , OR: 0.15 , 95 % CI: 0.05-0.43; divorced/widowed , OR: 0.11 , 95 % CI: 0.03-0.42) , family income ( 3-10 thousand RMB , OR: 2.01 , 95 % CI: 1.08-3.76; > 10 thousand RMB , OR: 2.14 , 95 % CI: 1.05-4.37) , quality of life ( fair , OR: 0.59 , 95 % CI: 0.39-0.91) , and social support ( excellent , OR: 0.50 , 95 % CI: 0.30-0.83) were all correlated with the degree of acceptance of breast reconstruction. Chinese breast cancer patients have a low degree of acceptance of breast reconstruction. The degree of acceptance was found to be correlated with age , marital status<symptom> , family monthly income , quality of life , and social support.
