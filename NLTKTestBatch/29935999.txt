 Prolonged exposure ( PE) is a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) based on emotional processing theory. According to this theory , emotional engagement during imaginal exposure is critical to clinical outcome. One rationale for virtual reality exposure therapy ( VRE) is the ability of trauma-relevant , multi-sensory stimuli to increase emotional engagement. This study compared the subjective distress of active duty soldiers ( N = 108) during exposure via PE or VRE. Soldiers with higher mean or peak distress during the first imaginal exposure had higher baseline PTSD symptom<symptom> severity. There was no difference between groups on average or peak distress during imaginal exposure at the first or final exposure session. There were no significant differences in between-session habituation observed between VRE and PE groups. However , each ten-point decrease in SUDS scores , either mean or peak , from the initiation of imaginal exposure to the end of treatment , was associated with a greater decrease in CAPS-W scores for both groups. There were no group differences in these trajectories or the magnitude of the association between distress/habituation , and PTSD symptoms<symptom>. Future research on VRE should measure patient ratings of engagement during exposure to better understand which patients are aided by this innovative approach to treatment.
