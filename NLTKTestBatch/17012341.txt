 Deep brain stimulation ( DBS) is known as the most effective technique in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases<disease> , especially Parkinson disease<disease> ( PD) and epilepsy. Relative healing and effective control of disease<disease> symptoms<symptom> are the most significant reasons for the tangible tendency in use and development of this technology. Nevertheless , more cellular and molecular investigations are required to reveal the detailed mechanism of DBS. Here , we reviewed the methods , challenges and the ways to overcome the limitations of DBS. Also , challenges in probe fabrication technology , material selection , related mechanical stability and biocompatibility concerns are discussed. Finally , closed- and open-loop stimulation systems were compared.
