 Tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC) is one of the most common genetic causes of epilepsy. Mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes lead to the dysregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR) pathway. This mTOR pathway hyperactivation is associated with several processes resulting in epileptic conditions. The occurrence of seizures<symptom> and their treatment outcomes seem to play a crucial role in cognitive and behavioral developments in patients with TSC. Mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors have been proven to be effective in epilepsy treatment in individuals with TSC. Specifically , because of their disease-modifying mechanism of action , they have the capability to prevent epileptogenesis in patients with TSC. This article will provide an overview of the current evidence of and delineate future perspectives for mTOR inhibitors and their role in preventing epileptogenesis.
