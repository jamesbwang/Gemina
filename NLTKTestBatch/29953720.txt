 Pulp necrosis<symptom> is a frequent complication following dental trauma. The diagnosis of the state of the dental pulp can be challenging as most commonly used diagnostic tools are subjective and rely on a response from the patient , potentially making their use unreliable , especially in the child population. The aim of the study was to systematically review the evidence on the use of laser Doppler flowmetry in the assessment of the pulp status<symptom> of permanent teeth compared to other sensibility and/or vitality tests. A systematic literature search , using MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlled-trials.com , in addition to citation and manual reference list searches , was conducted up to 15 Four studies with a high risk of bias were included in the final analysis. Laser Doppler flowmetry was reported to be more accurate in differentiating between teeth with normal pulps and pulp necrosis<symptom> with a sensitivity of ( 81.8-100 %) and specificity of 100 % in comparison to other vitality tests such as pulp oximetry ( sensitivity = 81.3 % , specificity = 94.9 %) and sensibility tests such as electric pulp testing ( sensitivity = 63.3- 91.5 % , specificity = 88- 100 %). Despite the higher reported sensitivity and specificity of laser Doppler flowmetry in assessing pulp blood flow , these data are based on studies with a high level of bias and serious shortfalls in study designs. More research is needed to study the effect of different laser Doppler flowmetry 's parameters on its diagnostic accuracy and the true cut-off ratios over which a tooth could be diagnosed as having a normal pulp.
