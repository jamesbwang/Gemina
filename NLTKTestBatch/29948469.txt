 The Brief Post-Coma Scale ( BPCS) is an easy diagnostic tool for individuals with disorders of consciousness<symptom> ( DoC) , in a reduced version from a previously Post-Coma Scale , that could distinguish patients in the minimally conscious state ( MCS) from those in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome<symptom> ( UWS) , formerly defined as vegetative state ( VS). Aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic validity of the BPCS in comparison with the Coma<symptom> Recovery Scale-Revised ( CRS-R) , in its Italian validated version , the Disability Rating Scale ( DRS) , the Level of Cognitive Functioning ( LCF) , and the Glasgow Outcome Scale ( GOS). In an Italian multicenter study on 545 patients with DoC , 36 post-acute rehabilitation wards , 32 long-term care centers , and 2 family associations participated to data collection. Statistically significant correlations were found between the BPCS and the other clinical scales: R = 0.586 ( p < 0.001) with LCF , R =- 0.566 ( p < 0.001) with DRS , R = 0.622 ( p < 0.001) with CRS-R. The BPCS scores resulted significantly correlated with the time from acute event ( R = 0.117 , p = 0.006). Patients with GOS score 2 had mean BPCS of 1.84 ± 1.19 , whereas those with GOS 3 had significantly higher scores 3.88 ± 1.71 ( p < 0.001). Similarly , in patients with vegetative state/UWS ( VS/UWS) , the mean BPSC score was 1.71 ± 1.09 , significantly lower ( p < 0.001) than that of patients with minimally conscious state ( BPCS = 3.83 ± 1.29). Finally , the agreement of the BPCS and clinical diagnosis was of 84.4 % , with an odds ratio OR = 3.781 ( 95 % CI = 3.026-4.725 , p < 0.001). The BPCS has demonstrated statistically significant correlations with the most commonly used scales in persons with DoC.
