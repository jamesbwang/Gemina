 Thrombolytic therapy is an effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke and provides benefits and improvements that lead to better neurological outcomes. However , thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( r-tPA) in hemodialysis ( HD) patients is limited because HD patients have a higher risk of bleeding. We report a case of a 75-year-old HD patient who presented with sudden aphasia<symptom> during HD treatment. She was brought to the hospital for treatment for infarction. Following thrombolytic therapy , we achieved re-opening without complications. To our knowledge , no report has been published describing the patients who had a stroke during a maintenance HD session and were treated with r-tPA successfully. Although the number of HD patients treated with r-tPA is small and requires further investigation , thrombolytic therapy can be an alternative option. After weighing the risks and benefits and assessing each patient carefully , the use of r-tPA should be considered , even in HD patients.
