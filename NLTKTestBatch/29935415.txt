 Recent studies suggest that hippocampus has different cortical connectivity and functionality along its longitudinal axis. We sought to elucidate the possible different pattern of atrophy in longitudinal axis of hippocampus between Amyloid/Tau pathology and TDP-43-pathies. Seventy-three presenile subjects were included: Amyloid/Tau group ( 33 Alzheimer 's disease<disease> with confirmed cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) biomarkers) , probable TDP-43 group ( 7 semantic variant progressive primary aphasia<symptom> , 5 GRN and 2 C9orf72 mutation carriers) and 26 healthy controls. We conducted a region-of-interest voxel-based morphometry analysis on the hippocampal longitudinal axis , by contrasting the groups , covarying with CSF biomarkers ( AÎ²
