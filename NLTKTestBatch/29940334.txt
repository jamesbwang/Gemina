 To study the structure of a broad and sustained hospital outbreak of OXA-48-producing Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom> belonging to ST405. Whole-genome sequencing and comparison of ten ST405 isolates obtained from clinical samples in our hospital. Thirty six single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) were detected ( range 0 to 21 in pairwise comparisons) and allele-specific PCR was used to call the SNPs among a larger set of isolates. Several haplotypes were identified within the population. The haplotypes did not show a spatial structure , but a temporal evolution sequential haplotype replacements was observed. The disperse spatial distribution suggests a reservoir formed by a large pool of colonized patients , and the temporal replacement pattern suggests that the sustained-outbreak is composed by several small outbreaks that appeares and rapidly dispersed to several units.
