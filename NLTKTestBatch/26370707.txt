 Trastuzumab plus docetaxel is a mainstay to treat HER2-positive breast cancers. However , developing nanoparticles could help to improve the efficacy/toxicity balance<symptom> of this doublet by improving drug trafficking and delivery to tumors. This project aimed to develop an immunoliposome in breast cancer , combining docetaxel encapsulated in a stealth liposome engrafted with trastuzumab , and comparing its performances on human breast cancer cell lines with standard combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab. Several strategies to engraft trastuzumab to pegylated liposomes were tested. Immunoliposomes made of natural ( antibody nanoconjugate-1 ( ANC-1)) and synthetic lipids ( ANC-2) were synthesized using standard thin film method and compared in size , morphology , docetaxel encapsulation , trastuzumab engraftment rates and stability. Antiproliferative activity was tested on human breast cancer models ranging from almost negative ( MDA-MB-231) , positive ( MDA-MB-453) to overexpressing ( SKBR3) HER2. Finally , cell uptake of ANC-1 was studied by electronic microscopy. ANC-1 showed a greater docetaxel encapsulation rate ( 73 % ± 6 % vs 53 % ± 4 %) and longer stability ( up to 1 week) as compared with ANC-2. Both ANC presented particle size ≤ 150 nm and showed similar or higher in vitro antiproliferative activities than standard treatment , ANC-1 performing better than ANC-2. The IC In vitro results suggest that higher antiproliferative efficacy and efficient drug delivery can be achieved in breast cancer models using nanoparticles.
