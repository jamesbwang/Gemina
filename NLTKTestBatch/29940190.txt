 Porcine deltacoronavirus<pathogen> ( PDCoV) , a newly discovered enteric coronavirus<pathogen> , is a causative agent of severe clinical diarrhea<disease><symptom> and intestinal pathological damage in piglets. As a first step toward understanding the effect of PDCoV on host cells , we elucidated mechanisms underlying the process of apoptotic cell death after PDCoV infection. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of PDCoV-induced apoptosis and reduction of PDCoV replication , suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway. Furthermore , PDCoV infection necessitated the activation of the initiator caspase-9 responsible for the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Experimental data indicated that PDCoV infection led to Bax-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization ( MOMP) , resulting in specific relocation of the mitochondrial cytochrome c ( cyt c) into the cytoplasm. Treatment with cyclosporin A ( CsA) , an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( MPTP) opening , significantly suppressed PDCoV-triggered apoptosis and viral replication. Moreover , cyt c release was completely abrogated in PDCoV-infected cells in the presence of CsA , suggesting the critical role of MPTP in intrinsic apoptosis in response to PDCoV infection. Altogether , our results indicate that PDCoV infection stimulates MOMP either via Bax recruitment or MPTP opening to permit the release of apoptogenic cyt c into the cytoplasm , thereby leading to execution of the caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis pathway to facilitate viral replication in vitro.
