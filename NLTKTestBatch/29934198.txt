 Rasagiline , a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor with neuroprotective potential in Parkinson 's disease<disease> , has shown a disease-modifying effect in the SOD1-Gly93Ala low-expressing mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , both alone and in combination with riluzole. We sought to test whether or not rasagiline 1 mg/day can prolong survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also receiving riluzole. Patients with possible , probable , or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were enrolled to our randomised , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , double-blind , phase 2 trial from 15 German network for motor neuron diseases<disease> ( MND-NET) centres ( university hospitals or clinics). Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years , had onset of progressive<symptom> weakness<symptom> within the 36 months before the study , had disease<disease> duration of more than 6 months and less than 3 years , and had a best-sitting slow vital capacity of at least 50 %. After a 4-week screening period , eligible patients were randomly assigned ( 1:1) to receive either rasagiline ( 1 mg/day) or placebo in addition to riluzole ( 100 mg/day) , after stratification for site of onset ( bulbar or spinal) and study centre. Patients and all personnel assessing outcome parameters were masked to treatment allocation. Patients were followed up 2 , 6 , 12 , and 18 months after randomisation. The primary endpoint was survival time , defined as the time to death or time to study cutoff date ( ie , the last patient 's last visit plus 14 days). Analyses of primary outcome and safety measures were done in all patients who received at least one dose of trial treatment ( intention-to-treat population). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01879241. Between July 2 , 2013 , and Nov<pathogen> 11 , 2014 , 273 patients were screened for eligibility , and 252 patients were randomly assigned to receive rasagiline ( n = 127) or placebo ( n = 125). 126 patients taking rasagiline and 125 taking placebo were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. For the primary outcome , the survival probability at the end of the study was 0 · 43 ( 95 % CI 0 · 25-0 · 59) in the rasagiline group ( n = 126) and 0 · 53 ( 0 · 43-0 · 62) in the placebo group ( n = 125). The estimated effect size ( hazard ratio) was 0 · 91 ( one-sided 97 · 5 % CI- infinity to 1 · 34; p = 0 · 31). Rasagiline was well tolerated , and most adverse events were due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease<disease> progression rather than treatment; the most frequent of these were dysphagia<symptom> ( 32 ( 25 %) taking rasagiline vs 24 ( 19 %) taking placebo) and respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 25 ( 20 %) vs 31 ( 25 %)). Frequency of adverse events were comparable between both groups. Rasagiline was safe in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There was no difference between groups in the primary outcome of survival , although post-hoc analysis suggested that rasagiline might modify disease<disease> progression in patients with an initial slope of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised greater than 0 · 5 points per month at baseline. This should be confirmed in another clinical trial. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.
