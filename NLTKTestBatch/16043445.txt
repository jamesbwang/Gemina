 Sexual activity is important to older adults ( 65 +). Breathlessness affects about 25 % of older adults but impact on sexual activity is unknown. We evaluated the relationships between breathlessness and sexual inactivity and self-reported health among older community-dwelling adults in the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Associations between self-reported breathlessness ( hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill) at baseline , self-reported sexual activity , overall health and health compared to people of the same age were explored using logistic regression at baseline and 2 years , adjusted for potential confounders ( age , sex , marital status<symptom> , smoking status<symptom> and co-morbidities). Of 798 participants ( mean age 76.4 years ( SD , 5.8) 65 to 103; 53 % men , 73 % married) , 688 ( 86.2 %) had 2-year follow-up data. People with breathlessness had higher prevalence and duration of sexual inactivity ( 77.7 % vs. 65.6 %; p < 0.001; 12 ( IQR , 5-17) vs. 9.5 ( IQR , 5-16) years; p = 0.043). Breathlessness was associated with more sexual inactivity , ( adjusted OR 1.75; ( 95 % CI) 1.24-2.45) , worse health ( adjusted OR 2.02; 1.53-2.67) and worse health compared to peers ( adjusted OR 1.72; 1.25-2.38). Baseline breathlessness did not predict more sexual inactivity at 2 years. In conclusion , breathlessness contributes to sexual inactivity and worse perceived health in older adults , which calls for improved assessment and management.
