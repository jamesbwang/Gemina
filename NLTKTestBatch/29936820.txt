 The great number of pigeon populations in many European cities promotes the spread of the European pigeon tick ( <i> Argas reflexus </i>) , the bites of which cause local and systemic reactions. The aim was to study the occurrence of <i> A. reflexus </i> in several cities of Upper Silesia , and skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> caused by <i> A. reflexus </i> tick bites in humans. The results of investigations carried out in 1995-2002 in five cities located in the Upper<symptom> Silesian conurbation are presented. Specimens of <i> A. reflexus </i> were collected for one hour in attics and lofts inhabited by these ticks. A history of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> caused by bites was taken from residents who had been infested by <i> A. reflexus </i>. The development of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> was monitored for three months in two individuals who had been bitten several times by these arthropods. In the localities , 987 <i> A. reflexus </i> specimens were collected , including 334 females , 269 males , and 384 various nymphal stages. Within one hour , 38-109 ticks specimens were collected at the study sites. Cases of attacks by unengorged <i> A. reflexus </i> were reported in all the habitats located in the residential buildings; the ticks were also found in residents ' flats and in staircases. Residents who had been repeatedly attacked by European pigeon ticks developed a strong inflammatory reaction to the components of tick saliva , and had purple papules with necrosis<symptom> in the centre of the lesion<symptom>. The tick bite areas exhibited scars and hyperpigmentation. Individuals attacked by <i> A. reflexus </i> several times are at risk of development of severe persistent local reactions to bites. Pigeon ticks , trophically associated with pigeons present abundantly in the Upper<symptom> Silesian conurbation and other European urban habitats , pose a serious threat to public health.
