 Labor intensive electroencephalogram ( EEG) analysis is a major bottleneck to identifying anti-epileptogenic treatments in experimental models of post-traumatic epilepsy. We aimed to develop an algorithm for automated seizure<symptom> detection in experimental post-traumatic epilepsy. Continuous ( 24/7) 1-month-long video-EEG monitoring with three epidural screw electrodes was started 154 d after lateral fluid-percussion induced traumatic brain injury ( TBI; n = 97) or sham-injury ( n = 29) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. First , an experienced researcher screened a total of 90,720 h of digitized recordings on a computer screen to annotate the occurrence of spontaneous<symptom> seizures<symptom>. The same files were then analyzed using an algorithm in Spike2 ( ver .9) , which searching for temporally linked power peaks ( 14-42 Hz) in all three EEG channels , and then positive events were marked as a probable seizures<symptom>. Finally , an experienced researcher confirmed all seizure<symptom> candidates visually on the computer screen. Visual analysis identified 197 seizures<symptom> in 29 rats. Automatic detection identified 4346 seizure<symptom> candidates in 109 rats , of which 202 in the same 29 rats were true positives , resulting in a false positive rate of 0.046/ h or 1.10/ d. The algorithm demonstrated 5 % specificity and 100 % sensitivity. The algorithm analyzed 1-month 3-channel EEG in 7 cohorts in 2 h , whereas analysis by an experienced technician took âˆ¼ 500 h. The algorithm had 100 % sensitivity. It performed slightly better and was substantially faster than investigator-performed visual analysis. We present a novel seizure<symptom> detection algorithm for automated detection of seizures<symptom> in a rat model of post-traumatic epilepsy.
