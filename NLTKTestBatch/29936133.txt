 Protein prenylation is a vital eukaryotic post-translational modification which permits interaction of proteins with cellular membranes<symptom>. Prenylated proteins are involved in a number of human<disease> diseases<disease> , and play a major role in cancers driven by the oncogene KRAS , which is normally farnesylated. In cases where the farnesylation machinery is inhibited , however , KRAS eludes inactivation by using an alternative prenylation pathway in which the protein is geranylgeranylated. In order to study this alternative prenylation , large quantities of accurately processed protein are required. We have developed a system to permit high-yield production of geranylgeranylated KRAS which utilizes an engineered baculovirus<pathogen> system. The development of this system helped to elucidate a potential metabolic bottleneck in insect cell production that should enable better production of any geranylgeranylated proteins using this system.
