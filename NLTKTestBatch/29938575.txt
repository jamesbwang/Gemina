 Psychological well-being in people with neurological diseases<disease> can be compromised due to brain damage or psychological reactions towards chronic disabilities. This systematic review evaluated the efficacy of positive psychological intervention ( PPI) in neurological populations. Previous studies relevant to this topic were identified by searches in PUBMED , EMBASE , MEDLINE , and PSYCINFO databases from Jan 1980 to August 2017. Of 1361 articles identified , 31 studies were included. Nineteen studies were randomized controlled trials. Sixteen studies had sample sizes of less than 30. Twelve studies were rated as high quality using the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute ( NHLBI) quality assessment tools. Six therapies were found: mindfulness-based approaches , positive savoring , life summary , expressive-based , hope-based interventions , and character strengths. These interventions were shown to improve quality of life , reduce symptomatic distress , and depressive symptoms<symptom>. PPIs promote well-being among patients with neurological deficits. For PPIs to be considered as an evidence-based practice , more trials with adequate statistical power are required.
