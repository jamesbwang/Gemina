 Alport syndrome<symptom> is a rare hereditary kidney disease<disease> manifested with progressive renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. Considerable variation exists in terms of disease<disease> progression among patients with Alport syndrome<symptom>. Identification of patients at high risk of rapid progression remains an unmet need. Urinary epidermal growth factor ( uEGF) has been shown to be independently associated with risk of progression to adverse kidney outcome in multiple independent adult chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD) cohorts. In this study , we aim to assess if uEGF is associated with kidney impairment and its prognostic value for children with Alport syndrome<symptom>. One hundred and seventeen pediatric patients with Alport syndrome<symptom> and 146 healthy children ( 3-18 years old) were included in this study. uEGF was measured in duplicates in baseline urine samples using ELISA ( R&D) and concentration was normalized by urine creatinine ( uEGF/Cr). In patients with longitudinal follow-up data ( n = 38) , progression was defined as deteriorated kidney function ( CKD stage increase) during follow-up period ( follow-up length is about 31 months in average). The association of baseline uEGF/Cr level with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) slope and Alport syndrome<symptom> patients ' progression to a more advanced CKD stage during the follow-up period was used to evaluate the prognostic value of the marker. We found that uEGF/creatinine ( uEGF/Cr) decreases with age in pediatric patients with Alport syndrome<symptom> with a significantly faster rate than in healthy children of the same age group. uEGF/Cr is significantly correlated with eGFR ( r = 0.75 , p < 0.001) , after adjustment for age. In 38 patients with longitudinal follow-up , we observed a significant correlation between uEGF/Cr and eGFR slope ( r = 0.58 , p < 0.001). Patients with lower uEGF/Cr level were at increased risk of progression to a higher CKD stage. uEGF/Cr was able to distinguish progressors from non-progressors with an AUC of 0.88 , versus 0.77 by eGFR and 0.81 by 24-h urinary protein ( 24-h UP). Our study suggests that uEGF/Cr is a promising biomarker for accelerated kidney function decline in pediatric patients with Alport syndrome<symptom>. It may help to identify patients at high risk of progression for targeted clinical care and improve the patients ' stratification in interventional trials.
