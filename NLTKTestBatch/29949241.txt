 Dehiscence or palatal fistula<disease> formation following palatoplasty is a complication that has grave consequences for the patient that include tissue loss , emotional distress to the parents and patient , and further medical costs. Palatal dehiscence or fistula<disease> formation is multifactorial following surgery-tension of wound<disease> closure , poor patient adherence to postoperative orders and wound<disease> infection<disease>infection<disease> are the most common causes for this. Oral colonization with pathogenic organisms could play a role in wound<disease> healing complications. Identification of intraoral bacteria<pathogen> among patients with cleft palates<symptom> has thus far not been performed. To identify the spectrum of intraoral bacteria<pathogen> in cleft palate patients in an African setting; a retrospective , chart review was performed at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital-a quaternary hospital in Durban , South Africa. All patients with unrepaired cleft palates<symptom> who underwent palatoplasty in 2015 were included. Fifty-two patients were included. Preoperative throat/palatal swabs were taken prior to palatoplasty. The various bacteria<pathogen> cultured from the aforementioned swabs were cataloged. Various bacteria<pathogen> were cultured. In total , 23 patients ( 44.2 %) had positive swab cultures. Eighteen cultures ( 34.6 %) had gram-positive growth only , four cultures ( 7.7 %) had gram-negative growth only , while one patient ( 1.9 %) cultured both a gram-positive and a gram-negative organism. Streptococcus<pathogen> viridans<pathogen> was the most commonly cultured organism ( 19.2 %) while beta-hemolytic streptococci were cultured from only 4 swabs ( 7.7 %). Our study cataloged the commonly occurring bacteria<pathogen> found in unrepaired cleft palate patients in Africa. Further research into the clinical significance of each bacteria<pathogen> is advised.
