 To determine the effects of a virtual reality intervention on pain and anxiety<symptom> in patients undergoing a bone<disease> marrow aspiration and biopsy procedure. 97 adults in an outpatient cancer center in the midwestern United States. In this quasiexperimental study , participants were assigned to either the experimental group ( use of virtual reality goggles) or the control group ( standard treatment). Vital signs , pain , and anxiety<symptom> were measured before and after the procedure. T tests and chi-square tests were used to compare the two groups based on demographic data , pain , anxiety<symptom> , and total amount of medication used during the procedure. Participants who wore virtual reality goggles during a bone<disease> marrow aspiration and biopsy procedure did not experience a statistically significant decrease in pain and anxiety<symptom>. However , the experimental and control groups showed a decrease in pain and anxiety<symptom> levels from pre- to postprocedure. Virtual reality goggles may be a feasible , noninvasive alternative to traditional pharmacologic treatment. The cost of any intervention would need to be considered. Virtual reality should be researched and adapted to benefit patients in appropriate settings.
