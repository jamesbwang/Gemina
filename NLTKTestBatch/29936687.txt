Case report of biopsy-confirmed periocular atypical pleomorphic adenoma. A 35-year-old female presented with a unique orbital lesion<symptom> found to be ectopic lacrimal gland demonstrating atypical pleomorphic adenoma on formal histopathologic review. Pleomorphic adenoma is pathologically characterized as an epithelial lesion<symptom> intermixed with mesenchymal elements. It is further classified as atypical with the presence of features such as hypercellularity , regions of necrosis<symptom> or hyalinization , cellular dysplasia , capsular violation , and malignant characteristics without frank local extension or distant metastases.
