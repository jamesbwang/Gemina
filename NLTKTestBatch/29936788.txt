 Endobronchial ultrasound ( EBUS) features have been shown to be useful in predicting etiology of enlarged malignant lymph nodes. However , there is dearth of evidence especially from developing countries. We assessed the EBUS characteristics across various mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathies. In this prospective study , all patients with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom> on CT Chest and who were planned for EBUS-FNA ( Fine Needle Aspiration) were included. EBUS features of lymph nodes studied were shape , size , margins , echogenicity , central hilar structure ( CHS) , coagulation necrosis<symptom> sign and colour power doppler index ( CPDI). These were scored and compared between benign and malignant lymphadenopathies. A total of 86 lymph nodes in 46 patients were prospectively studied of which 23 ( 26.7 %) were malignant , 27 ( 31.3 %) tuberculosis<disease> and 36 ( 41.8 %) sarcoidosis. There was significant difference between malignant and benign lymph nodes in terms of CHS ( central hilar structutre) ( p = 0.011) , margins ( p = 0.036) and coagulation necrosis<symptom> sign ( p < 0.001). On comparison of features of malignancy and tuberculosis<disease> , there were significant differences in margins ( p = 0.016) and coagulation necrosis<symptom> sign ( p 0.001). However , when malignancy and sarcoidosis was compared , there were differences in echogenicity ( p = 0.002) , CHS ( p = 0.009) and coagulation necrosis<symptom> sign ( p < 0.001). Only coagulation necrosis<symptom> sign was found to be highly consistent with malignant lymph nodes. The other features can not be used to distinguish malignant from benign lymph nodes , especially in a developing country like India where tuberculosis<disease> is a common cause of mediastinal lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom>.
