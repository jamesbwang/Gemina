 Low family socioeconomic status ( SES) is closely related to increased risk of emotional maladaptation among adolescents. Although previous studies have found that low family SES is a significant and common experience for most rural-to-urban migrant adolescents in China , little research has examined the association between family SES and emotional adaptation or identified the protective factors that may minimise emotional maladaptation among these adolescents. The present study examined the associations between family SES and three indices of emotional adaptation ( emotion regulation , life satisfaction and depression<symptom>) and the moderating effects of adolescents ' resilience and parental positive emotion ( PE) among 486 Chinese rural-to-urban migrant adolescents. The results suggest that family SES was significantly associated with migrant adolescents ' emotional outcomes , to varying degrees. Moreover , both adolescents ' resilience and PE moderated the associations between family SES and emotional outcomes , although the protective effects of the two moderators differed on the three emotional outcomes. These findings shed light into designing intervention and prevention programs to reduce emotional maladaptation among migrant adolescents.
