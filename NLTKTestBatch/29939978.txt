 We evaluated adapting the quick Sequential ( Sepsis-Related) Organ<symptom> Failure<symptom> Assessment score ( fast respiratory rate , altered<symptom> mental<symptom> status<symptom> , low<symptom> blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>) for pediatric use by selecting thresholds from three commonly used definitions: Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 , Pediatric Advanced Life Support , and International Pediatric Sepsis<disease> Consensus Conference. We examined their respective performance in identifying children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection at high risk of mortality using PICU registry data , with additional focus on the influence of age on performance. Analysis of retrospective data obtained from the Virtual Pediatric Systems PICU database. The performance in predicting observed mortality was assessed for the three candidate approaches using receiver operating characteristics analysis , including age group effects. The Virtual Pediatric Systems database contains data on diagnosis , clinical markers , and outcomes in prospectively collected clinical records from 130 participating PICUs in the United States and Canada. Children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection in a participating PICU between 2009 and 2014 , for which all required data were available. None. Data from 40,228 children revealed an overall mortality of 4.22 %. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ( 95 % CI) was 0.760 ( 0.749-0.771) for Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation , 0.700 ( 0.689-0.712) for Pediatric Advanced Life Support , and 0.709 ( 0.696-0.721) for International Pediatric Sepsis<disease> Consensus Conference. When split by age group , the performance of Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation was lowest in the youngest neonates ( under 1 wk old) , with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ( 95 % CI) of 0.724 ( 0.656-0.791) , and in the teenagers ( 13-18 yr) , with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.710 ( 0.682-0.738) , yet it still outperformed Pediatric Advanced Life Support and International Pediatric Sepsis<disease> Consensus Conference in both groups. Among critically ill children who had a discharge diagnosis of infection in the PICU , quick Sequential ( Sepsis-Related) Organ<symptom> Failure<symptom> Assessment score performs best when using the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 age thresholds with mechanical ventilation , while all definitions performed worse at extremes of pediatric age. Thus , mortality risk varies with vital sign thresholds , and although Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 with mechanical ventilation performed marginally better , it is unlikely to be of use to clinicians. More work is needed to develop a robust and relevant pediatric sepsis<disease> risk score.
