 Maternal protein malnutrition throughout pregnancy and lactation compromises brain development in late gestation and after birth , affecting structural , biochemical , and pathway dynamics with lasting consequences for motor and cognitive function. However , the importance of nutrition during the preimplantation period for brain development is unknown. We have previously shown that maternal low-protein diet ( LPD) confined to the preimplantation period ( Emb-LPD) in mice , with normal nutrition thereafter , is sufficient to induce cardiometabolic and locomotory behavioral abnormalities in adult offspring. Here , using a range of in vivo and in vitro techniques , we report that Emb-LPD and sustained LPD reduce neural stem cell ( NSC) and progenitor cell numbers at E12 .5 , E14 .5 , and E17 .5 through suppressed proliferation rates in both ganglionic eminences and cortex of the fetal brain. Moreover , Emb-LPD causes remaining NSCs to up-regulate the neuronal differentiation rate beyond control levels , whereas in LPD , apoptosis increases to possibly temper neuron formation. Furthermore , Emb-LPD adult offspring maintain the increase in neuron proportion in the cortex , display increased cortex thickness , and exhibit short-term memory deficit analyzed by the novel-object recognition assay. Last , we identify altered expression of fragile X family genes as a potential molecular mechanism for adverse programming of brain development. Collectively , these data demonstrate that poor maternal nutrition from conception is sufficient to cause abnormal<symptom> brain development and adult memory<symptom> loss<symptom>.
