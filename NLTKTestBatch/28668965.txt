 Red blood cells ( RBCs) generate microvesicles to remove damaged cell constituents such as oxidized hemoglobin and damaged membrane constituents , and thereby prolong their lifespan. Damage to hemoglobin , in combination with altered phosphorylation of membrane proteins such as band 3 , lead to a weakening of the binding between the lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton , and thereby to membrane budding and microparticle shedding. Microvesicle generation is disturbed in patients with RBC-centered diseases<disease> , such as sickle cell disease<disease> , glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency , spherocytosis or malaria<disease>. A disturbance of the membrane-cytoskeleton interaction is likely to be the main underlying mechanism , as is supported by data obtained from RBCs stored in blood bank conditions. A detailed proteomic , lipidomic and immunogenic comparison of microvesicles derived from different sources is essential in the identification of the processes that trigger vesicle generation. The contribution of RBC-derived microvesicles to inflammation<symptom> , thrombosis and autoimmune reactions emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of microvesicle generation.
