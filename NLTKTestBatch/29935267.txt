 Saline and hypersaline environments make up the largest ecosystem on earth and the organisms living in such water-restricted environments have developed unique ways to cope with high salinity. As such these organisms not only carry significant industrial potential in a world where freshwater supplies are rapidly diminishing , but they also shed light upon the origins and extremes of life. One largely overlooked and potentially important feature of many salt-loving organisms is their ability to produce fructans , fructose polymers widely found in various mesophilic Eubacteria and plants , with potential functions as storage carbohydrates , aiding stress tolerance , and acting as virulence factors or signaling molecules. Intriguingly , within the whole archaeal domain of life , Archaea possessing putative fructan biosynthetic enzymes were found to belong to the extremely halophilic class of Halobacteria only , indicating a strong , yet unexplored link between the fructan syndrome<symptom> and salinity. In fact , this link may indeed lead to novel strategies in fighting the global salinization problem. Hence this review explores the unknown world of fructanogenic salt-loving organisms , where water scarcity is the main stress factor for life. Within this scope , prokaryotes and plants of the saline world are discussed in detail , with special emphasis on their salt adaptation mechanisms , the potential roles of fructans and fructosyltransferase enzymes in adaptation and survival as well as future aspects for all fructanogenic salt-loving domains of life.
