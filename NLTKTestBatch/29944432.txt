 A rotated head<disease> posture<symptom> at the time of a rear-end impact is associated with a higher risk of acute and chronic whiplash injury. The objective of this study was to quantify the amplitude and duration of rotated head<disease> postures<symptom> observed in drivers during naturalistic driving. Twenty volunteers ( 14 males: 36 ± 12 years , 6 females: 27 ± 5 years) drove a 2010 Subaru Impreza on public roads while their 3D head<disease> angular position relative to the car was recorded using inertial measurement units. An experimenter rode in the passenger seat ( right side) and logged when subjects performed one of six head<disease><symptom> movements<symptom>: bilateral shoulder and side mirror checks , looking at the rear-view mirror and looking at the front seat passenger. Video of the subjects was used to confirm the logged head<disease><symptom> movements<symptom> and identify movements that the experimenter missed. The duration and amplitude of all six head<disease><symptom> movements<symptom> were tabulated and then compared between periods when the car was moving and when the car was stationary. During a 68 ± 5 min drive , subjects performed a median ( range) of 15 ( 5-39) left shoulder checks , 82.5 ( 29-167) left mirror checks , 40.5 ( 10-168) rear-view mirror checks , 27.5 ( 3-113) right mirror checks , 60 ( 0-185) passenger-looks , and 12.5 ( 1-28) right shoulder checks. Peak yaw angles of the head<disease> relative to the vehicle for these six movements averaged -81.5 ° , -34.3 ° , 16.2 ° , 42.1 ° , 58.2 ° , 84.3 ° respectively. Drivers spent a larger proportion of time in non-neutral postures<symptom> when the vehicle was stopped ( 17.5 %) compared to moving ( 8.2 %) ( Z = 3.92 , p < 0.0001). Drivers also moved their head<disease> further from neutral during the movements when the car was stationary compared to moving ( t Drivers use larger and longer duration head<disease><symptom> movements<symptom> when stationary than when driving. Given an increased risk of whiplash injury for initially rotated head<disease> postures<symptom> , these findings provide a possible explanation for why drivers are more likely to be injured when hit from behind while their vehicle is stationary. Further , the head<disease> postures<symptom> characterized in this study can be used as initial conditions in volunteer and computational studies to improve our understanding of why non-neutral head<disease> postures<symptom> are associated with increased whiplash injury risk.
