 The functional status<symptom> of dynamic microglial cells plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of microenvironment in CNS. In a previous study , we reported that microglia phenotype might be involved in stress vulnerability and depression<symptom> recurrence. Here , we aimed to clarify a character of microglia exposed persistently to glucocorticoid ( GC) , which is representative a stress hormone , in primary cultured microglial cells. Five nanomolars of dexamethasone ( DEX , GC agonist) for 72 h decreased CX3CR1 and CD200R expression and induced ramified form of microglial cells in similar morphology to in vivo resident microglia. However , the ramified form of microglia did not increase microglia signature genes such as P2RY12 , OLFML3 , TMEM119 , and TGFBR1. In addition , DEX-treated microglia showed a reduction of phagocytosis function , pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine production , and cell proliferation. DEX washout did not restore these changes. Based on transcriptomic analysis and functional characters of DEX-treated microglia , we performed senescence-associated beta-galactosidase ( SA-β gal) assay in DEX-treated microglia and DEX-treated microglia showed more SA-β gal activity with alteration of cell cycle-related genes. Thus , our results suggest that DEX can induce a specific phenotype of microglia ( like-senescence).
