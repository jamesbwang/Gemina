 We studied associations of number of daily cigarettes in the first trimester with placental weight<symptom> and birthweight in women who smoked throughout pregnancy , and in women who stopped smoking after the first trimester. We included all women with delivery of a singleton in Norway ( n = 698891) during 1999-2014 , by using data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We assessed dose-response associations by applying linear regression with restricted cubic splines. In total , 12.6 % smoked daily in the first trimester , and 3.7 % stopped daily smoking. In women who smoked throughout pregnancy , placental weight<symptom> and birthweight decreased by number of cigarettes; however , above 11-12 cigarettes we estimated no further decrease ( Pnon-linearity < 0.001). Maximum decrease in placental weight<symptom> in smokers compared with non-smokers was 18.2 g ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 16.6 to 19.7) , and for birthweight the maximum decrease was 261.9 g ( 95 % CI: 256.1 to 267.7). In women who stopped smoking , placental weight<symptom> was higher than in non-smokers and increased by number of cigarettes to a maximum of 16.2 g ( 95 % CI: 9.9 to 22.6). Birthweight was similar in women who stopped smoking and non-smokers , and we found no change by number of cigarettes ( Pnon-linearity < 0.001). In women who smoked throughout pregnancy , placental weight<symptom> and birthweight decreased non-linearly by number of cigarettes in the first trimester. In women who stopped smoking , placental weight<symptom> was higher than in non-smokers and increased linearly by number of cigarettes; birthweight was almost similar to that of non-smokers.
