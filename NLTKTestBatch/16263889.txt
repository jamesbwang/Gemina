 Cardiac rehabilitation ( CR) is an essential part of contemporary coronary heart disease<disease> management. However , patients exiting a center-based CR program have difficulty retaining its benefits. We aimed to evaluate the added benefit of a home-based CR program with telemonitoring guidance on physical fitness in patients with coronary artery disease<disease> ( CAD) completing a phase II ambulatory CR program and to compare the effectiveness of this program in a prolonged center-based CR intervention by means of a randomized controlled trial. Between February 2014 and August 2016 , 90 CAD patients ( unblinded , mean age 61.2 years , SD 7.6; 80/90 , 89.0 % males; mean height 1.73 m , SD 0.7; mean weight<symptom> 82.9 kg , SD 13; mean body mass index 27.5 kg/m Following 12 weeks of intervention , the increase in VO Adding a home-based exercise program with telemonitoring guidance following completion of a phase II ambulatory CR program results in further improvement of physical fitness and is equally as effective as prolonging a center-based CR in patients with CAD.
