 This concept analysis is to clarify what behavior management in the field of nursing means , what attributes signify it , and what its antecedents and consequences are. A variety of definitions of behavior management were identified in literature. This has resulted in a degree of confusion<symptom> in the way behavior management is described. The Walker and Avant concept analysis approach was applied. Literature searches were conducted using CINAHL , Academic Search Complete , Business Source Complete , Communication and Mass Media Complete , Education Research Complete , PubMed Medline , Google Scholar and many online dictionaries , with timeline from January 2000 to November 2017. The analysis demonstrates that the concept of behavior management in nursing field has two core attributes: ( a) conscious actions to maintain and promote positive activities , and ( b) training and assisting from the person who has knowledge and experience. Antecedents include poor general knowledge , lack of ability to control , and personality. Consequences include an improvement of quality and productivity and quality of life , reduction of mortality rate of diseases<disease> , and development of pro-social skills for the youth. The analysis helps nurses to understand the concept and its application into clinical practice as well as to develop appropriate intervention plans for patients.
