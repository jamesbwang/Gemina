 The noninvasive detection of turbulent coronary flow may enable diagnosis of significant coronary artery disease<disease> ( CAD) using novel sensor and analytic technology. Eligible patients ( n = 1013) with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and CAD risk factors undergoing nuclear stress testing were studied using the CADence ( AUM Cardiovascular Inc. , Northfield MN) acoustic detection ( AD) system. The trial was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of AD for diagnostic accuracy in detecting significant CAD as compared to an objective performance criteria ( sensitivity 83 % and specificity 80 % , with 15 % non-inferiority margins) for nuclear stress testing. AD analysis was blinded to clinical , core lab-adjudicated angiographic , and nuclear data. The presence of significant CAD was determined by computed tomographic ( CCTA) or invasive angiography. A total of 1013 subjects without prior coronary revascularization or Q-wave myocardial infarction were enrolled. Primary analysis was performed on subjects with complete angiographic and AD data ( n = 763) including 111 subjects ( 15 %) with severe CAD based on CCTA ( n = 34) and invasive angiography ( n = 77). The sensitivity and specificity of AD were 78 % ( p = 0.012 for non-inferiority) and 35 % ( p < 0.001 for failure to demonstrate non-inferiority) , respectively. AD results had a high 91 % negative predictive value for the presence of significant CAD. AD testing failed to demonstrate non-inferior diagnostic accuracy as compared to the historical performance of a nuclear stress OPC due to low specificity. AD sensitivity was non-inferior in detecting significant CAD with a high negative predictive value supporting a potential value in excluding CAD.
