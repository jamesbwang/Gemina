 Polio<disease> affects the quality of life of those who have suffered from it and causes health problems including the post-polio syndrome<symptom>. The main goals of this work were to know the patients perspective of how they have been affected by the disease<disease> and establish the knowledge of post-polio syndrome<symptom> among patients and primary health care professionals. Interpretive qualitative research based on the Grounded Theory carried out in two health-care centers in the city of Malaga , one of them with care-rural clinics. Four focal groups were established with the participation of thirteen patients and two focus groups with twenty-six professional participants. Intentional sampling is performed until saturation. The analysis follows an inductive strategy using the Atlas Ti5 .2 software. The people affected by polio<disease> reports their personal histories of suffering counteracted by strong family support and an active coping attitude , marked by great effort exertion , willpower and endurance. These people made a positive assessment of their lives minimising the limitations. They presented compatible symptoms<symptom> with post-polio syndrome<symptom> , which remain unidentified due to the lack of knowledge of it among patients and health-care professionals. The health care provided was considered deficient due to several causes as for instance lack of involvement , communication problems. The day-to-day polio<disease> experience is focused on personal overcoming with major roles played by family support , difficult relationships with the healthcare system and lack of knowledge of the post-polio syndrome<symptom>.
