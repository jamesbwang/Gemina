 Gammaherpesviruses<pathogen> ( GHVs) are host specific DNA viruses<pathogen> that infect a large range of mammalian species. These viruses<pathogen> preferentially target host lymphocyte<symptom> cell populations and infection may lead to morbidity or mortality in immunocompromised , co-infected , or non-adapted hosts. In this study , we tested for the presence of
