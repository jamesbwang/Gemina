 A patient with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome<symptom> was initially treated with scalenectomy , first rib resection , and wrapping of the brachial plexus ( BP) with amnion membrane ( AM) to prevent postoperative adhesions. Twelve months later , at reoperation for recurrent symptoms<symptom> , the AM was observed to be intact. The BP had no scar tissue around it. Recurrence was due to scarring around the nerve roots superior to the portion of the plexus that had been wrapped with AM. It was concluded that the AM had successfully protected the portion of the BP that had been wrapped. Longer term studies are in progress.
