 While bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity , these procedures may have unfavorable effects on bone and mineral metabolism. The most pronounced abnormalities are disorders of calcium/vitamin D metabolism , bone loss , as well as increased risk of bone fracture. These changes that occur after surgery vary by procedure type. Proposed mechanisms include skeletal unloading , malabsorption , secondary hyperparathyroidism and changes<symptom> in gut hormones. This review explores bone response to bariatric surgery , potential mechanisms for these changes.
