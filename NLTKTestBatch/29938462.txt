 There have been no nationwide studies to investigate the trends in incidence and 5-year survival rates of intra- and extrahepatic bile duct cancers and gallbladder cancer. Therefore , our study aimed to describe the incidence and 5-year survival rates of biliary<disease> tract<symptom> cancers by subsites in South Korea. A total of 86,134 patients with biliary<disease> tract<symptom> cancers were selected from the National Health Information Database. Age-standardized incidence rates and annual percentage changes were calculated. Life-table methods and log-rank tests were used to determine the differences in survival rates. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio of the patients with biliary<disease> tract<symptom> cancers. The incidence rate of intrahepatic bile duct cancer decreased by 1.3 % annually from 8.8 per 100,000 in 2006 to 7.8 per 100,000 in 2015. Extrahepatic bile duct cancer also showed a decreasing trend by 2.2 % per year from 8.7 per 100,000 in 2006 to 6.7 per 100,000 in 2015. Gallbladder cancer showed the greatest decline , with an annual percentage change of 2.8 % from 6.3 per 100,000 to 5.2 per 100,000 during the same period. The 5-year survival rates were 30.0 % in gallbladder cancer , 27.8 % in extrahepatic bile duct cancer , and 15.9 % in intrahepatic bile duct cancer. The overall incidence rates of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct cancer and gallbladder cancer decreased from 2006 to 2015. Among biliary<disease> tract<symptom> cancers , intrahepatic bile duct cancers exhibited a high incidence rate and poor survival rate.
