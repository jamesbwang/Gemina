 Conventional radiography is currently the most common imaging modality used by veterinarians investigating foals with suspected osteomyelitis<disease>. Emerging evidence in adult horses and humans suggests computed tomography ( CT) is a superior modality for evaluation of osseous changes in general. This study aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of CT versus conventional radiography in cases of osteomyelitis<disease> in foals. Cases of osteomyelitis<disease> in foals under 6 months of age admitted over a 6-year period at a single referral hospital that had both CT and conventional radiography images were retrieved. Case details and measurements of the largest area of bone lysis identified in two planes ( lateromedial/sagittal and dorsopalmar/dorsal) were evaluated by three veterinarians with a range of experience. A significant difference regarding lesion<symptom> size was seen on the lateromedial ( LM) radiographic projections compared with the equivalent sagittal plane CT image. The LM radiographic evaluation resulted in a 37 % underestimation of the area of the lesion<symptom>. Additionally , use of the LM radiographic projections were 2.5-fold more variable in the measurement area compared with CT.. In general , regardless of projection , CT produced more information regarding lesion<symptom> area and , in some cases , detected osseous changes that were not evident on the radiographs. LM radiographic projections are less reliable and commonly result in an under-appreciation of lesion<symptom> size and extent. CT detected lesions<symptom> that were difficult or impossible to identify on radiographs and may allow improved treatment planning.
