 Surfactants are ubiquitous in cellular membranes<symptom> , detergents or as emulsification agents. Due to their amphiphilic properties , they can not only mediate between two domains of very different solvent compatibility like water and organic but also show fascinating self-assembly features resulting in micelles , vesicles or lyotropic liquid crystals. The current review article highlights some approaches towards the next generation surfactants , e.g. those with catalytically active heads<symptom>. Furthermore , it is shown that amphiphilic properties can be obtained beyond the classical hydrophobic-hydrophilic interplay , for instance with surfactants containing one molecular block with a special shape. Whereas , classical surfactants are static , one became more and more interested in species , which are able to change their properties depending on external triggers. The article discusses examples for surfactants sensitive to chemical ( e.g. pH-value) or physical triggers ( temperature , electric and magnetic fields).
