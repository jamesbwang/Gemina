 Electronic friction is a correction to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation , whereby nuclei in motion experience a drag in the presence of a manifold of electronic states. The notion of electronic friction has a long history and has been ( re-) discovered in the context of a wide variety of different chemical and physical systems including , but not limited to , surface scattering events , surface reactions or chemisorption , electrochemistry , and conduction through molecular- ( or nano-) junctions. Over the years , quite a few different forms of electronic friction have been offered in the literature. In this perspective , we briefly review these developments of electronic friction , highlighting the fact that we can now isolate a single , unifying form for ( Markovian) electronic friction. We also focus on the role of electron-electron interactions for understanding frictional effects and offer our thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses<symptom> of using electronic friction to model dynamics in general.
