 Disorders that specifically affect central and peripheral<symptom> vision<symptom> constitute invaluable models to study how the human brain adapts to visual deafferentation. We explored cortical changes after the loss of central or peripheral<symptom> vision<symptom>. Cortical thickness ( CoTks) and resting-state cortical entropy ( rs-CoEn) , as a surrogate for neural and synaptic complexity , were extracted in 12 Stargardt macular dystrophy , 12 retinitis pigmentosa ( tunnel vision stage) , and 14 normally sighted subjects. When compared to controls , both groups with visual loss exhibited decreased CoTks in dorsal area V3d. Peripheral visual field loss also showed a specific CoTks decrease in early visual cortex and ventral area V4 , while central visual field loss in dorsal area V3A. Only central visual field loss exhibited increased CoEn in LO-2 area and FG1. Current results revealed biomarkers of brain plasticity within the dorsal and the ventral visual streams following central and peripheral visual field defects.
