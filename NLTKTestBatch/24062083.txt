 Good quality wound<disease> dressings should have exceptional properties for usage , such as being able to remove excess wound<disease> exudates<symptom> , having rapid dehydration<symptom> , and providing optimal water vapour permeability. This study evaluated and compared the morphological and physical properties of six different commercially absorbent wound<disease> dressings in Thailand: two hydrocolloids , two alginates , and two foams. These wound<disease> dressings are available in a variety of components and structures , some of which have a multilayer structure. The results showed that the calcium sodium alginate dressings had better absorption properties than the calcium alginate dressings , hydrocolloid dressings , hydrocolloid with foam layer dressings , foam with polyurethane film layer dressings , and foam with hydrogel and polyurethane film layer dressings. Furthermore , the calcium sodium alginate dressings had the highest rate of dehydration<symptom> and provided an optimal water vapour transmission rate. However , the calcium sodium alginate dressings could not retain the original structure after being submerged with a wound<disease> exudate<symptom>.
