 We present the case of a 26-year-old otherwise healthy man with an isolated tibial and fibular shaft fracture who developed signs of fat embolism syndrome<symptom> ( FES) within 6 hours of injury and prior to any operative treatment. General orthopaedists and traumatologists should be aware that the onset of FES is not always delayed for several days , but can develop within 6 hours of injury. After initiation of appropriate management , including respiratory support , our patient did well. There was union of the fracture , and he was able to return to work at 3 months postinjury.
