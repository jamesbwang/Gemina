 Prasugrel is a potent antiplatelet therapy that has demonstrated to be superior to clopidogrel for patients with acute coronary syndromes<symptom> ( ACS) but has three main contraindications. Prospective study of all patients admitted for ACS in two hospitals. Prasugrel contraindication group was defined by the presence of age > 75 years , weight<symptom> < 60 kg or previous stroke. We also performed a propensity score matching to obtain a well-balanced subset of patients with the same probability of receiving ticagrelor. We included 8207 patients and 2538 ( 30.9 %) had any contraindication for prasugrel , being age > 75 years the most frequent ( 29.0 %). Hospital mortality was 4.4 % and it was > 2-fold higher in patients with any contraindication for prasugrel ( 7.9 % vs. 2.8 %; p < 0.01). Postdischarge follow-up ( median 59.9 months) revealed that patients with prasugrel contraindication had higher cardiovascular and all-cause mortality as well as a first major cardiovascular event ( MACE). No differences in bleeding rates were found in patients with vs. without prasugrel contraindication. Prasugrel contraindication was independently associated to higher cardiovascular ( HR: 1.42) and all-cause mortality ( HR: 1.47) , as well as higher MACE ( HR: 1.25). In the sub-cohort of 482 pairs of patients , obtained by a propensity score matching , ticagrelor treatment was associated with lower cardiovascular death ( HR: 0.22) , all-cause mortality ( HR: 0.30) and first MACE ( HR: 0.58) in patients with prasugrel contraindication. Almost one third of ACS patients have prasugrel contraindications and they have worst in in-hospital and post-discharge prognosis. Ticagrelor improved postdischarge outcomes in patients with prasugrel contraindications.
