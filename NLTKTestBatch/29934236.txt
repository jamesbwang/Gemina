 Sleep hygiene-related conditions are factors that affect the symptoms<symptom> experienced by patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA). However , very few studies have investigated the association between sleep hygiene and sleep symptoms<symptom> , especially in patients with mild or moderate OSA. This study evaluated the relationship between factors related to sleep hygiene and clinical symptoms<symptom> in patients with mild to moderate OSA. One hundred and seventy-four patients who visited the Sleep Breathing Disorder Center at a tertiary academic center to evaluate suspected OSA were included. All patients underwent standard polysomnography ( PSG) and the Epworth sleepiness scale ( ESS) and questionnaires related to daytime and nighttime symptoms<symptom> and sleep hygiene. Medical records were reviewed for demographic , clinical , and PSG parameters. Correlation analysis between sleep hygiene-related conditions and clinical symptoms<symptom> in patients with mild to moderate OSA was performed. The correlation analysis between the nine categories of sleep hygiene and the three categories of clinical symptoms<symptom> showed that , in the case of inadequate temperature and humidity conditions , the three categories of clinical symptoms<symptom> were more severe ( daytime symptoms<symptom> r = 0.382 , nighttime symptoms<symptom> r = 0.568 , ESS score r = 0.321). Drinking alcohol before sleep ( daytime symptoms<symptom> r = 0.457 , nighttime symptoms<symptom> r = 0.649 , ESS score r = 0.301) and emotional excitement or arousal ( daytime symptoms<symptom> r = 0.378 , nighttime symptoms<symptom> r = 0.545 , ESS score r = 0.341) were correlated with greater severity of each of the clinical symptoms<symptom> ( p < 0.05). Among the factors of sleep hygiene-related conditions , inadequate temperature and humidity , drinking alcohol before sleep , and emotional excitement or arousal were associated with symptoms<symptom> of mild to moderate OSA. This study supports the hypothesis that patients with mild to moderate OSA can experience symptom<symptom> relief if they are trained to correct lifestyle habits to maintain adequate sleep hygiene-related conditions.
