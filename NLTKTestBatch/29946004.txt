 Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria<pathogen> were quantitated in respiratory samples across three cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) centres using extended culture methods. Subjects , ages 1-69 years , who were clinically stable provided sputum<symptom> ( n = 200) or bronchoalveolar lavage ( n = 55). Eighteen anaerobic and 39 aerobic genera were cultured from 59 % and 95 % of samples , respectively; 16/57 genera had a â‰¥ 5 % prevalence across centres. Analyses of microbial communities using co-occurrence networks in sputum<symptom> samples showed groupings of oral , including anaerobic , bacteria<pathogen> whereas typical CF pathogens formed distinct entities.
