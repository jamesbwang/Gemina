 There are multiple reasons for imaging the soft<disease> tissues of the neck in the emergency setting , in particular when symptoms<symptom> are vague or if there is worry for complications from a certain clinical diagnosis. When fluid is seen in the retropharyngeal space , it is important to pay attention to history and look at key structures in the neck. This article will discuss anatomy of the retropharyngeal space , followed by four causes of fluid within the space that the radiologist is likely to encounter in the emergency setting: tonsillitis/pharyngitis , acute calcific tendinitis of the longus colli muscles , internal jugular vein thrombosis , and post-radiation changes. It is important to recognize these entities because each has different clinical implications and management.
