 Prior research has illustrated that high volumes of aerobic exercise result in a reduction in basal concentrations of testosterone in men. These prior studies have mostly been conducted on recreational runners and identified reduced testosterone , but not concentrations low enough to be considered pathological. Therefore , the purpose of this study is to assess the basal concentrations of testosterone and cortisol in elite triathletes , as well as assess the impact of a World Championship race on the acute responses of these hormones. 22 men ( Age: 40.6 ± 11.5 yrs; Height: 179 ± 6 cm; Weight<symptom>: 77.0 ± 7.0 kg) who participated in the 2011 Ironman World Championships served as subjects. Resting blood samples were taken 2-4 days prior ( BL) , as well as immediately ( IP) , 1 day ( D1) and 2 days ( D2) following the event , and were later analyzed for total testosterone and cortisol concentrations. At BL , of the 22 subjects , 9 men had a normal testosterone concentration , while 9 men fell within a ` grey zone ' and 4 other men demonstrated concentrations suggestive of deficiency. Testosterone was significantly lower than BL at D1 ( 95 % CI = 0.10-0.34 , P < 0.001 , ES = 0.53) and D2 ( 95 % CI = 0.01-0.21 , P = 0.034 , ES = 0.35). Cortisol was significantly different from baseline at IP ( 95 % CI = 1.07-0.83 , P < 0.001 , ES = 8.0). There were significant correlations between time and age ( R = 0.68 , P = 0.001) as well as baseline testosterone and cortisol ( R = 0.51 , P = 0.015). Elite ultra-endurance athletes may demonstrate not only reduced testosterone , but sometimes clinically low concentrations that could be indicative of androgen deficiency.
