 Hyperammonaemia is a common complication of liver disease<disease> in dogs. High concentrations of ammonia<pathogen> can be detrimental to dogs with liver disease<disease> for several reasons , notably by causing hepatic encephalopathy ( HE) which describes the wide range of neurological abnormalities ranging from altered behaviour to seizures<symptom> that are well recognised complications in dogs with hepatic disorders. In human patients with liver disease<disease> , hyperammonaemia has also been linked to the development of other systemic complications such as dysregulation of the innate immune system. In contrast , the effects of hyperammonaemia on the canine innate immune system is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ammonia<pathogen> on the oxidative burst activity of canine polymorphonuclear cells in vitro. Blood obtained from healthy dogs ( n = 8) was incubated with escalating concentrations of ammonia<pathogen> ranging from 0 to 250 μM , and the percentage of cells experiencing an oxidative burst was evaluated using a commercial kit ( Phagoburst ™) and flow cytometry. The spontaneous oxidative burst was evaluated without stimulation and also following stimulation with E coli<pathogen>. The pH of the blood was also measured at the differing ammonia<pathogen> concentrations. There was an increase in the percentage of cells experiencing a spontaneous oxidative burst from ammonia<pathogen> concentrations of 125 μM ( p = < 0.05) and above ( p = < 0.01) , with a 4.9 fold increase at 200 μM ( p = < 0.001). In those cells stimulated with E coli<pathogen> , incubation with increasing ammonia<pathogen> concentrations did not result in a significant difference in oxidative burst from baseline ( p = 0.953). There was no statistically significant difference between the pH of the blood at the various ammonia<pathogen> concentrations ( p = 0.2) suggesting that the difference in spontaneous oxidative burst was due to the ammonia<pathogen> rather than simply a change in pH conditions. In summary , the spontaneous oxidative burst of neutrophils was significantly increased from baseline. This supports a potential role of ammonia<pathogen> in contributing to innate immune system dysfunction in dogs with liver disease<disease> , and may present a future therapeutic target.
