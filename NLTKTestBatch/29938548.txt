 Trichoblastoma ( TB) and basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) are 2 different neoplasms composed of basaloid cells and have overlapping histopathological features. We compared the immunoexpression of CD10 , T-cell death-associated gene 51 ( TDAG51) , cytokeratin 20 ( CK20) , androgen receptor ( AR) , insulinoma-associated protein 1 ( INSM1) , and nestin for the differential diagnosis of these tumors. We assessed a total of 27 BCC and 27 TB cases , including 4 TB lesions<symptom> in nevus sebaceous and 3 malignant TB lesions<symptom> for CD10 , TDAG51 , CK20 , AR , INSM1 , and nestin expression. Staining for CK20 , TDAG51 , INSM1 , and stromal CD10 was significantly more common in TB cases than in BCC cases ( P < .001). Epithelial CD10 and AR staining was significantly more common in BCC cases than in TB cases ( P < .001). The difference between the groups for nestin staining was not significant ( P > .05). Stromal CD10 staining was the most sensitive marker ( 96.3 %) and INSM1 the least sensitive ( 55.6 %) marker for TB. TDAG51 showed 100 % specificity for TB. A larger number of CK20 positive cells was found in the cases associated with nevus sebaceous than in the other TBs. All the selected markers except nestin were useful for the differential diagnosis between TB and BCC. CD10 and TDAG51 were more useful than the other markers. The use of CK20 could be preferred in nevus sebaceous lesions<symptom>. INSM1 was less effective in highlighting Merkel cells within the lesion<symptom> than CK20.
