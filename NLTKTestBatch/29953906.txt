 Auditory neglect has been found in adults with right hemisphere focal brain lesions<symptom> following strokes. Visual and tactile neglect has been found in children following both left and right hemisphere lesions<symptom> resulting from perinatal strokes. The present cross-sectional study assessed auditory neglect in children with early unilateral brain damage from perinatal stroke. Twenty-six children with perinatal stroke and matched controls participated. All were asked to identify the location of a pure tone presented in left or right auditory fields. We found that children who had experienced left hemisphere perinatal strokes were significantly better at localizing sounds<symptom> on the left side of space than the right side of space , and that response times improved with age on a normal trajectory relative to controls in left hemispace , while they did not improve normally in right hemispace. Children with right hemisphere perinatal strokes were significantly worse at localizing sounds<symptom> on the right side of space relative to typically developing controls , and did not follow control trajectories for improvement in response times on the left or the right sides of space. Our preliminary results suggest that left hemisphere perinatal strokes may result in contralateral auditory neglect , while right hemisphere perinatal strokes may result in bilateral auditory neglect. Neglect was more severe in children with parietal lobe involvement , suggesting that the parietal lobe may play a dominant role in auditory attention in the developing brain.
