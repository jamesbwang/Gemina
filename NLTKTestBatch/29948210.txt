 ( R) -2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyric acid ( R-HPBA) is a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The asymmetric reduction of 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid ( OPBA) by oxidoreductases is an efficient approach for its synthesis. Here , we report a novel biocatalytic approach for asymmetric synthesis of R-HPBA using recombinant Pichia pastoris expressing the Tyr52Leu variant of D-lactate dehydrogenase ( D-LDH) from Lactobacillus<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen>. The recombinant yeast cells showed impressive catalytic activity at a high concentration of NaOPBA ( 380 mM , 76 g/L) and achieved full conversion starting with 40 g/L NaOPBA or even at higher concentration. Under optimized reaction conditions ( pH 7.5 , 37 Â°C , and 2 % glucose) , a full conversion with > 95 % reaction yield and ~ 100 % product enantiomeric excess<symptom> ( ee) was achieved for the preparation of R-HPBA on a 2-g scale. The findings of this study promote both the biotransformation of R-HPBA and an extension of the application of recombinant yeast as biocatalysts.
