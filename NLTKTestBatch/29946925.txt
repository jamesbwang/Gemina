 To investigate whether multiphasic MDCT enhancement profiles can help to identify PTEN expression in clear cell renal cell carcinomas ( ccRCCs). Lack of PTEN expression is associated with worsened overall survival , a more advanced Fuhrman grade , and a greater likelihood of lymph mode metastasis. With IRB approval for this retrospective study , we derived a cohort of 103 histologically proven ccRCCs with preoperative 4-phase renal mass MDCT from 2001-2013. Following manual segmentation , a computer-assisted detection algorithm selected a 0.5-cm-diameter region of maximal attenuation within each lesion<symptom> in each phase; a 0.5-cm-diameter region of interest was manually placed on uninvolved renal cortex in each phase. The relative attenuation of each lesion<symptom> was calculated as ( ( Maximal lesion<symptom> attenuation- cortex attenuation)/ cortex attenuation) Ã— 100. Absolute and relative attenuation in each phase were compared using t tests. The performance of multiphasic enhancement in identifying PTEN expression was assessed with logistic regression analysis. PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative ccRCCs both exhibited peak enhancement in the corticomedullary phase. Relative corticomedullary phase attenuation was significantly greater for PTEN-negative ccRCCs in comparison to PTEN-positive ccRCCs ( 33.7 vs. 9.5 , p = 0.03). After controlling for lesion<symptom> stage and size , relative corticomedullary phase attenuation had an accuracy of 84 % ( 86/103) , specificity of 100 % ( 84/84) , sensitivity of 11 % ( 2/19) , positive predictive value of 100 % ( 2/2) , and negative predictive value of 83 % ( 84/101) in identifying PTEN expression. Relative corticomedullary phase attenuation may help to identify PTEN expression in ccRCCs , if validated prospectively.
