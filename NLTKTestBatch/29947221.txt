 The need for point-of-care ( POC) devices capable of early detecting diseases<disease> and monitoring their status<symptom> , out of a lab environment , has stimulated the development of compact biosensing configurations. While Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance ( LSPR) sensing integrated into a state-of-the-art microfluidic chip stands as a promising approach to meet this demand , its implementation into an operating sensing platform capable to detect quantitatively a set of molecular biomarkers in an unknown biological sample is only at its infancy. Here , we present an on-chip LSPR chip capable to perform automatic , quantitative and multiplexed , screening of biomarkers. We demonstrate its versatility by programming it to detect and quantify in human serum four relevant human serum protein markers associated with breast-cancer.
