 Individuals often carry items in one hand instead of both hands during activities of daily living. Research Question The purpose of this study was to investigate low back and lower extremity frontal plane moments for loaded limb stance and unloaded limb stance when carrying symmetric and asymmetric loads during stair negotiation. Participants were instructed to ascend and descend a three-step staircase at preferred pace using a right leg lead and a left leg lead for each load condition: no load , 20 % body<symptom> weight<symptom> ( BW) bilateral load , and 20 % BW unilateral load. L5/S1 contralateral bending , hip abduction , external knee varus , and ankle inversion moments were calculated using inverse dynamics. Peak L5/S1 contralateral bending moments were significantly higher when carrying a 20 % BW unilateral load as compared to a 20 % BW bilateral load for both stair ascent and stair descent. In addition , peak L5/S1 contralateral bending moments were significantly higher during step one than for step two. Peak external knee varus and hip abduction moments were significantly higher in unloaded limb stance as compared to loaded limb stance when carrying a 20 % BW unilateral load. General load carriage recommendations include carrying less than 20 % BW loads and splitting loads bilaterally when feasible. Assessment recommendations include analyzing the first stair step and analyzing both the loaded and unloaded limbs.
