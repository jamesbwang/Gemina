 Meningeal melanocytoma is a rare pigmented tumor arising from leptomeningeal melanocytes. Patients with this tumor might initially consult a dentist because a mass lesion<symptom> in Meckel 's cave could manifest as dental pain and malocclusion , thereby mimicking temporomandibular disorder. The diagnostic approach , especially using imaging modalities , would be challenging in such cases unless an interdisciplinary approach is used. Here , we report a case of a 39-year-old Japanese man who had a history of pain and numbness on the left side of his face and malocclusion for 3 months before the initial visit. The diagnosis was primary intracranial meningeal melanocytoma arising from Meckel 's cave. The process by which the final diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma was reached highlights the importance of collaboration between the medical and dental disciplines. This case also demonstrates that meningeal melanocytoma has a specific signal pattern on magnetic resonance imaging , including high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
