 Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is a degenerative neurological condition causing demyelination and neuronal loss. Tremor<symptom> , a symptom<symptom> of MS , is prevalent in 45.0-46.8 % NARCOMS registrants. Although several tools to measure tremor<symptom> exist , few outcomes are quantitative or regularly utilized clinically. Introduction of a novel adaptation of the digital spiral drawing to find a quick , sensitive , and clinically useful technique , to predict tremor<symptom> in persons with MS ( pwMS). Digital spiral measures included: Segment Rate ( SEGRT) , Standard Deviation ( SD) of Radial Velocity ( VSD-R) , SD of Tangential Velocity ( VSD-T) , SD of Overall Velocity ( VSD-O) , Mean Drawing Velocity ( MNV-O) and Mean Pen Pressure Acceleration ( MNA-P). Digital spiral measures were compared with the manual Archimedes Spiral ( AS) drawing and the following clinical measures: Finger-Nose Test ( FNT) , presence of visually observed intention tremor<symptom> ( VOT) , Nine-Hole Peg Test ( NHPT) , and Box and Block Test ( BBT). All clinical measures utilized demonstrated significant relationships with all digital variables , except VSD-R. The forward-stepwise regression revealed BBT accounted for the most variance , followed by SEGRT. Comparison with Existing Methods: SEGRT is more sensitive in detecting VOT and better for quantifying tremor<symptom> than AS. BBT and SEGRT are optimal predictive measures for tremor<symptom>. SEGRT has stronger sensitivity and negative predictive value than AS in detecting VOT. All clinical measures ( NHPT , FNT , BBT , and AS) were significantly associated with the digital variables ( SEGRT , VSD-T , VSD-O , MNV-O , and MNA-P) except for VSD-R. After controlling for Patient Determined Disease<disease> Steps ( PDDS) , BBT and SEGRT are the best predictive measures for tremor<symptom>.
