 To describe the demographics , presentation , treatment , and outcome in 10 cases of lacrimal sac diverticulum and to review the literature on this topic , and to determine the incidence of diverticula from a series of dacryocystograms. Data were collected for all consecutive patients with lacrimal sac diverticulum seen between 2003 and 2015 , including patient demographics , clinical presentation , imaging findings , treatment , and follow-up. A systematic literature review was performed for cases of lacrimal sac diverticulum. A retrospective review of 400 consecutive dacryocystograms was performed to determine the incidence of lacrimal sac diverticulum. Ten cases ( 9 patients) of lacrimal sac diverticulum are described , and a further 36 cases were discovered through a literature review. Epiphora , swelling , and dacryocystitis and/or diverticulitis were the most common presenting complaints. When all 46 cases are combined , lacrimal patency was demonstrated in 50 % of cases. Dacryocystography diagnosed only 57 % of patients with diverticulum , not helped by the addition of ultrasound or CT.. The incidence of diverticulum was 3.2 % on review of 400 consecutive dacryocystograms ( 1.6 % per lacrimal system). Surgical management with dacryocystorhinostomy and/or diverticulum excision was effective in all 34 operated cases at resolving symptoms<symptom> in the case series and literature review. Lacrimal sac diverticula present with epiphora , medial canthal swelling , dacryocystitis , and/or diverticulitis. Dacryocystography , despite being the most sensitive radiologic test , is only 59 % sensitive , and adjunctive CT and ultrasound have limited use. Surgical management is recommended because conservative management often fails. Dacryocystorhinostomy , diverticulum excision , or a combination thereof appears to be equivalent in achieving resolution of symptoms<symptom>.
