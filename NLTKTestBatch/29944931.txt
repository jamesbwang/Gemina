 Cesarean section scar diverticulum ( CSD) lead to many long-term complications. CSD is more prevalent in patients with a retroflexed uterus than in those with an anteflexed uterus. To estimate the association between flexion of the uterus and the outcome of treatment for a cesarean section scar diverticulum ( CSD) treated by vaginal repair. Retrospective cohort study ( Canadian Task Force classification II-2). University hospital. A total of 241 women with a CSD were enrolled at the Shanghai First Maternity & Infant Hospital between May 2014 and Oct 2016. Vaginal excision and suture of CSD. A high failure rate was reported in remodelling of the scar by other surgeries in women with retroflexed uteri. Clinical information was obtained from medical records. Since intermenstrual bleeding was a presenting symptom<symptom> of CSD , duration of menstruation was compared between groups. They were required to be followed up at 1 , 3 , and 6 months to record their menstruation situation and measure the CSD. The thickness of the residual myometrium ( TRM) in the retroflexion group was much thinner than that in the anteflexion group before treatment ( 2.5 ± 1.2 mm vs 2.9 ± 1.1 mm , P < .05). There was no statistical difference in pretreatment menstruation duration between groups ( P > .05). The duration of menstruation in the anteflexion group was 8.2 ± 2.1 days and 8.5 ± 2.1 days , and the duration of menstruation in the retroflexion group was 7.6 ± 2.0 days and 7.7 ± 3.1 days at 3 and 6 months after surgery ( P < .05). Meanwhile , in all 58.6 % ( 140/239) of the patients who had a retroflexed uterus , 60.0 % ( 84/140) of these patients reached ≤ 7 days of menstruation at 6 months after surgery ( P < .05). Though about 40 % patients still had CSD after repair , menstruation duration and TRM were improved significantly ( P < .05). We propose that vaginal repair can relieve symptoms<symptom> and improved TRM for CSD patients , especially for those who have a retroflexed uterus , though 40 % of patients still had a defect post-operatively.
