 Recent studies link vitamin D deficiency with depression<symptom>; however evidences from the Nepalese population are scarce. The current study explored the association between vitamin D deficiency and depression<symptom> among 300 adults of 18 years and above age residing in eastern Nepal. Validated Nepali version of the Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory scale ( BDI-Ia) was used to determine depressive symptoms<symptom> and a BDI cutoff score of ≥ 20 was considered as clinically significant depression<symptom>. Sociodemographic data were collected using semi-structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected to measure serum 25‑hydroxy vitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D) and classify vitamin D status ( deficient , insufficient and sufficient). We used Chi-square test to identify the association of sociodemographic variables and vitamin D status with clinically significant depression<symptom>. We found a significant association of gender , geographical location of residence , marital status , religion and vitamin D status with clinically significant depression<symptom>. Binary logistic regression model was used to examine the likelihood of clinically significant depression<symptom> among vitamin D deficient individuals. Vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with increased odds of clinically significant depression<symptom> even after adjusting for confounding variables. This finding suggests Vitamin D deficient people have increased odds of having clinically significant depression<symptom>.
