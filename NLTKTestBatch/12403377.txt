 Kawasaki disease<disease> ( KD) is an acute febrile systemic vasculitis most commonly seen in children under 5 years old. High-dose aspirin is often administered , but the duration of such treatment varies. Many centers reduce the aspirin dose once the patient is afebrile , even before treating said patient with intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG). However , a randomized controlled trial regarding high-dose aspirin in the acute stage of KD has not previously been carried out. This trial has been designed as a multi-center , prospective , randomized controlled , evaluator-blinded trial with two parallel groups to determine whether IVIG alone as the primary therapy in acute-stage KD is as effective as IVIG combined with high-dose aspirin therapy. The primary endpoint is defined as coronary artery lesion<symptom> ( CAL) formation at 6-8 weeks. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria are randomly assigned ( 1:1) to a test group ( that receives only IVIG) or a standard group ( that receives IVIG plus high-dose aspirin). This clinical trial is conducted at three medical centers in Taiwan. Since high-dose aspirin has significant anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet functions , it does not appear to affect disease<disease> outcomes. Furthermore , it can decrease hemoglobin levels. Therefore , we have initiated this randomized controlled trial to evaluate the necessity of high-dose aspirin in the acute stage of KD.
