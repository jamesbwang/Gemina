 Penetrating gluteal wounds<disease> with retained foreign bodies are relatively uncommon and therefore there is no agreed-upon method of extraction. Retrieval of such objects can be difficult to achieve due to imperfect anatomy and a lack of clear planes across which the objects traverse , sometimes requiring novel techniques for foreign body retrieval. We saw a 37-year-old male with a 2-month history of a draining abscess<symptom> on his right buttock. CT and manual probing of the wound<disease> demonstrated a 5-cm tract with a possible foreign body within. We took the patient to the operating room for exploration of the tract under general anesthesia , allowing for palpation of the foreign object as well as digital rectal exam , which identified an object passing posterior to the rectum. A cystoscope was used to widen the tract and allow for better visualization. Grasping forceps were inserted into the cystoscope and used to capture/retrieve the object.
