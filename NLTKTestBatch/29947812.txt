 Serum zinc concentration is used to assess the zinc status<symptom> of populations. Cutoffs for serum zinc were developed on the basis of data from the second NHANES ( 1976-1980). The objective of this study was to evaluate serum zinc concentrations in the US population and to determine factors affecting serum zinc with the use of NHANES 2011-2014. Serum zinc was determined in males and females aged ≥ 6 y with the use of NHANES 2011-2014 ( n = 4347). Dietary zinc intake was determined , and factors affecting serum zinc were identified with the use of regression models adjusting for sex , age , fasting status<symptom> , and time of blood draw. ORs were calculated to identify factors associated with the risk of being below the serum zinc cutoff , and the prevalence of low serum zinc in the US was calculated. P < 0.01 was considered significant. Mean ± SE serum zinc concentration in males and females was 84.9 ± 0.8 and 80.6 ± 0.6 , respectively ( P < 0.0001). Regression models with serum zinc as the dependent variable indicated that afternoon and evening blood draws ( β = -9.7 and -15.3; P < 0.0001) were negatively associated with serum zinc concentrations and serum albumin ( β = 16.1; P < 0.0001) and hemoglobin ( β = 1.0; P = 0.0048) were positively associated with serum zinc concentrations. Hypoalbuminemia ( OR = 11.2; 99 % CI: 3.4 , 37.3) , anemia<symptom> in females ( OR: 3.4; 99 % CI: 1.7 , 6.9) , and pregnancy ( OR: 9.6; 99 % CI: 2.9 , 31.9) increased the odds of being below the serum zinc cutoff ( P < 0.0001 for all). Zinc from diet or supplements did not affect serum zinc ( P > 0.01). Approximately 3.8 % of children ( < 10 y) , 8.6 % of males ( ≥ 10 y) , and 8.2 % of females ( ≥ 10 y) were below the serum zinc cutoff. Factors such as sex , age , and time of blood draw should be considered when using serum zinc concentration to determine the zinc status<symptom> of a population. Caution is advised when interpreting serum zinc concentration in populations with a high prevalence of hypoalbuminemia or anemia<symptom>.
