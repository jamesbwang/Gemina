 The purpose of this article was to determine if pediatric dental treatment under general anesthesia utilizing orotracheal intubation takes longer than using nasotracheal intubation techniques. Twenty-six American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status<symptom> Classification I and II pediatric dental patients , ages 2-8 years treated under general anesthesia , were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: ( a) nasotracheal intubation ( control , n = 13) , ( b) orotracheal intubation ( experimental , n = 13). Times for intubation , radiographic imaging , and dental procedures , as well as total case time were quantified. Data were collected on airway difficulty , numbers of providers needed for intubation , intubation attempts , and intubation trauma. There was a significant difference in mean intubation time ( oral = 2.1 minutes versus nasal = 6.3 minutes; p < .01). There was no difference in mean radiograph time ( oral = 4.2 minutes versus nasal = 3.4 minutes; p = .144) , and overall radiograph image quality was not affected. There was no difference in dental procedure time ( p = .603) or total case time ( p = .695). Additional providers were needed for intubation and more attempts were required for nasotracheal intubation versus orotracheal intubation ( 6 additional providers/22 attempts vs 0 additional providers/15 attempts , p < .01 and p < .05 , respectively). Nine of 13 nasotracheal intubations were rated as traumatic ( 69 %) versus 0 of 13 for orotracheal intubations ( 0 %) ( p < .01). In 7/9 orotracheal intubation cases ( 78 %) , the tube was not moved during treatment ( p < .01). Orotracheal intubation does not increase case time , does not interfere with radiographic imaging , and is less traumatic for the patient when performed by physician anesthesiologists , emergency and pediatric medicine physician residents , certified registered nurse anesthetists , and student nurse anesthetists , all with variable nasotracheal intubation experience.
