 Diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma ( MPM) is a rare cancer that is ultimately fatal in almost all afflicted individuals. Morbidity and mortality from MPM is due to its propensity to progress locoregionally within the abdominal cavity. Patients with MPM most commonly present with nonspecific abdominal<symptom> symptoms<symptom> that usually lead to diagnosis when the condition is relatively advanced. MPM is considered a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy.
