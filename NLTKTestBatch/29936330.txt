 Hemodialysis patients in Japan are aging , but the influence of lifestyle factors on EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level ( EQ-5D-5 L) scores in older hemodialysis patients is unclear. This study aimed to measure health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D-5 L for older hemodialysis patients and to identify the lifestyle factors affecting EQ-5D-5 L scores in Japan. Outpatients aged 65 years or older who had been receiving maintenance hemodialysis for more than 5 years were selected to determine their EQ-5D-5 L scores. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to identify items affecting the EQ-5D-5 L scores. The response rate was 59.7 % ( 748/1251) , after excluding 9 patients who did not fulfill the participation criteria , and we analyzed data from 739 patients ( 462 men , 277 women) aged 72.9 ± 6.5 years ( mean ± standard deviation) with a mean duration of hemodialysis of 15.1 ± 8.8 years. The mean EQ-5D-5 L score was 0.738 ± 0.207. Higher Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale scores ( regression coefficient , -0.467; P < 0.001) , reduced walking ability ( -0.201; P < 0.001) , duration of hemodialysis ( -0.175; P < 0.001) , age ( -0.143; P < 0.001) , and subjective symptoms<symptom> ( -0.128; P < 0.001) showed significant negative correlations with the EQ-5D-5 L score. Reduced walking ability , and Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> , were associated with lower EQ-5D-5 L score and appeared to be important factors in decreasing health for older hemodialysis patients. These results suggest that patients ' families and dialysis facility staff should be trained in early detection of depression<symptom> and that patients should maintain their walking ability by exercise therapy.
