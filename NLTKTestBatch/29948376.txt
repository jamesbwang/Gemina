 Genetic generalized epilepsies ( GGE) ( childhood absence epilepsy ( CAE) , juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ( JME) and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures<symptom> ( GTCS)) are mainly determined by genetic factors. Since few mutations were identified in rare families with autosomal dominant GGE , a polygenic inheritance was suspected in most patients. Recent studies on large American or European cohorts of sporadic cases showed that susceptibility genes were numerous although their variants were rare , making their identification difficult. Here , we reported clinical and genetic characteristics of 30 Tunisian GGE families , including 71 GGE patients. The phenotype was close to that in sporadic cases. Nineteen pedigrees had a homogeneous type of GGE ( JME-CAE-CGTS) , and 11 combined these epileptic syndromes<symptom>. Rare non-synonymous variants were selected in probands using a targeted panel of 30 candidate genes and their segregation was determined in families. Molecular studies incriminated different genes , mainly CACNA1H and MAST4. The segregation of at least two variants in different genes in some pedigrees was compatible with the hypothesis of an oligogenic inheritance , which was in accordance with the relatively low frequency of consanguineous probands. Since at least 2 susceptibility genes were likely shared by different populations , genetic factors involved in the majority of Tunisian GGE families remain to be discovered. Their identification should be easier in families with a homogeneous type of GGE , in which an intra-familial genetic homogeneity could be suspected.
