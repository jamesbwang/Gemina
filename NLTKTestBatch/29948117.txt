 Carbohydrates are the product of carbon dioxide fixation by algae<pathogen> in the ocean. Their polysaccharides are depolymerized by marine bacteria<pathogen> , with a vast array of carbohydrate-active enzymes. These enzymes are important tools to establish biotechnological processes based on algal biomass. Green<symptom> tides , which cover coastal areas with huge amounts of algae<pathogen> from the genus Ulva , represent a globally rising problem , but also an opportunity because their biomass could be used in biorefinery processes. One major component of their cell walls is the anionic polysaccharide ulvan for which the enzymatic depolymerization remains largely unknown. Ulvan lyases catalyze the initial depolymerization step of this polysaccharide , but only a few of these enzymes have been described. Here , we report the cloning , overexpression , purification , and detailed biochemical characterization of the endolytic ulvan lyase from Formosa agariphila KMM 3901
