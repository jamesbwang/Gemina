 Some time ago , potato transformants expressing Agrobacterium-derived auxin synthesis gene tms1 were generated. These tms1-transgenic plants , showing enhanced productivity , were studied for their hormonal status<symptom> , turnover and<symptom> responses<symptom> in comparison with control plants. For this purpose , contents of phytohormones belonging to six different classes ( auxins , cytokinins , gibberellins , abscisic , jasmonic and salicylic acids) were determined by a sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method in tubers and shoots of in vitro grown plants. To date , this study represents the most comprehensive analysis of the potato hormonal system. On the basis of obtained results , several new generalizations concerning potato hormonal status<symptom> were drawn. Overall , these data can serve as a framework for forthcoming integrative studies of the hormonal system in potato plants.
