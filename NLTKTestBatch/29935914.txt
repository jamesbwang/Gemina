 The definition of oligometastatic disease<disease> has evolved into distinct intermediate stages of different prognosis between single metastasis and polymetastatic disease<disease>. We assessed the therapeutic impact of such clinical definitions based on a review of the literature. Increasingly advanced stages of the metastatic disease<disease> with some prominent oligometastatic targets can be treated with stereotactic irradiation with ablative intent owing to its excellent tolerance profile. Used in different settings , metastatic ablation can either prolong progression free survival , delay change of systemic therapy or delay the time to symptoms<symptom>. It may also improve survival , quality of life and health care costs in some situations. While most approaches have studied metastases by anatomic site rather than histology , combined systemic-ablative local treatment approaches are being developed for cancers of similar behavior. Biology-driven and imaging-oriented approaches are being investigated to better identify metastatic profiles for treatment guidance.
