 Since the increase in some tubular damage biomarkers can be observed at the early stage of diabetic nephropathy , even in the absence of albuminuria , we aimed to investigate if urinary albumin is superior than tubular damage marker , such as serum retinol-binding protein 4 ( RBP4) , in predicting renal function decline ( defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1 .73 m A total of 106 sedentary T2D patients ( mean ( ± standard deviation) age 64.9 ( ± 6.6) years) were included in this cross-sectional study. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters ( fasting glucose , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) , lipid parameters , creatinine , RBP4 , high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP) , urinary albumin excretion ( UAE)) , as well as blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> were obtained. HsCRP ( odds ratio ( OR) = 0.754 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) ( 0.603-0.942) , Although serum RBP4 showed excellent clinical accuracy , just like UAE , a combination of markers of tubular damage , inflammation<symptom> , and traditional markers has the higher sensitivity and specificity than UAE alone for prediction renal impairment in patients with T2D.
