 How movements are continuously adapted to physiological and environmental changes is a fundamental question in systems neuroscience. While many studies have elucidated the mechanisms which underlie short-term sensorimotor adaptation ( ∼ 10-30 min) , how these motor memories are maintained over longer-term ( > 3-5 days)- and thanks to which neural systems-is virtually unknown. Here , we examine in healthy human participants whether the temporo-parietal junction ( TPJ) is causally involved in the induction and/or the retention<symptom> of saccadic eye movements<symptom> ' adaptation. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( spTMS) was applied while subjects performed a ∼ 15 min size-decrease adaptation task of leftward reactive saccades. A TMS pulse was delivered over the TPJ in the right hemisphere ( rTPJ) in each trial either 30 , 60 , 90 or 120 msec ( in 4 separate adaptation sessions) after the saccade onset. In two control groups of subjects , the same adaptation procedure was achieved either alone ( No-TMS) or combined with spTMS applied over the vertex ( SHAM-TMS). While the timing of spTMS over the rTPJ did not significantly affect the speed and immediate after-effect of adaptation , we found that the amount of adaptation retention<symptom> measured 10 days later was markedly larger ( 42 %) than in both the No-TMS ( 21 %) and the SHAM-TMS ( 11 %) control groups. These results demonstrate for the first time that the cerebral cortex is causally involved in maintaining long-term oculomotor memories.
