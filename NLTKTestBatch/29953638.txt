 The insulin-like growth factor ( IGF) system regulates fetoplacental growth and plays a role in disease<disease> programming. Dysregulation of the IGF-system is implicated in several pregnancy perturbations associated with altered fetal growth , including intrauterine growth restriction and maternal obesity. Limited human studies have demonstrated that maternal exercise enhances fetoplacental growth and decreases cord IGF ligands , which may restore the placental IGF-system in complicated pregnancies. This study investigated the impact maternal exercise has on the placental IGF-system in placentae from mothers born growth restricted and if these outcomes are dependent on maternal diet or fetal sex. Uteroplacental insufficiency ( Restricted) or sham ( Control) surgery was induced on embryonic day ( E) 18 in Wistar-Kyoto rats. F1 offspring were fed a Chow or High-fat diet from weaning , and at 16 weeks were randomly allocated an exercise protocol; Sedentary , Exercised prior to and during pregnancy ( Exercise) , or Exercised during pregnancy only ( PregEx). Females were mated ( 20 weeks) with placentae associated with F2 fetuses collected at E20. The placental IGF-system mRNA abundance and placental morphology was altered in mothers born growth restricted. Exercise increased fetal weight<symptom> and Control plasma IGF1 concentrations , and decreased female placental weight<symptom>. PregEx did not influence fetoplacental growth but increased placental IGF1 and IGF1R ( potentially modulated by reduced Let 7f-1 miRNA) and decreased placental IGF2 protein. Importantly , these placental IGF-system changes occurred with sex-specific responses. These data highlight that exercise differently influences fetoplacental growth and the placental IGF-system depending on maternal exercise initiation , which may prevent the transgenerational transmission of deficits and dysfunction<symptom>.
