 Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common and significant causes of cancer-related death. Metastasis to mediastinal lymph nodes and/or pleura without liver or lung involvement is an atypical pattern of colon cancer metastasis. A 70-year-old male underwent curative right side hemicolectomy and omentectomy for ascending colon cancer followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Around nine months after surgery , the patient was noted to have bilateral large pleural effusions<symptom> on the restaging computed tomography scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. No intraabdominal or intrathoracic mass/metastasis was seen on the imaging. Multiple thoracentesis performed over the course of next few months revealed exudative effusion<symptom> but failed to demonstrate malignant cells. A few months later , new mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom> was noted on the repeat computed tomography scan. A subsequent positron-emission tomography scan revealed multiple sites of fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG)- avid mediastinal lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom>. The sites of pleural effusion<symptom> were not fluorodeoxyglucose-avid. Endobronchial ultrasound and biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed adenocarcinoma with signet-ring features. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic colon cancer. Systemic treatment with chemotherapy was initiated. Our case highlights the importance of mediastinal evaluation by imaging during the follow-up of patients with colorectal carcinoma. The ideal management strategy for mediastinal metastasis of colorectal carcinoma remains a question , two major options being local metastasectomy or systemic chemotherapy.
