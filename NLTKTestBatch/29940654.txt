 The plexiform variant of spindle cell lipoma is very uncommon. In fact , as far as we are aware only seven cases have been previously reported. We describe herein the case of a 49-year-old man with a smooth nodule<disease> of the mucosa of the lower lip that was gradually increasing. Surgical excision of the lesion<symptom> was done and the study revealed the histological and immunohistochemical features of a plexiform spindle cell lipoma ( PSCL). Peculiar to this case was the location in the lip , the presence of abundant S100-positive dendritic cells , and scarce mature lipogenic cells. S100 protein reactivity has rarely been observed in classical and plexiform spindle cell lipoma. To our knowledge , no case of PSCL displaying abundant S100-positive dendritic cells has been described. This feature may lead to a diagnostic pitfall. The main differential diagnosis includes the neuroma group , plexiform intraneural neurofibroma ( PIN) , plexiform schwannoma and plexiform hybrid tumor of perineurioma and cellular neurothekeoma. It is imperative correctly diagnose and differentiate PSCL from neural tumors because they may show syndromic associations , have different prognosis , including malignant transformation in PIN , and the management of all these lesions<symptom> differs.
