 Pregnancy Outcomes after Exposure to TNF-α Inhibitors During Pregnancy for the Treatment of Arthritic Diseases<disease>: A Meta-Analysis Authors: Mirdamadi K , Salinas T , Vali<disease> R , Papadimitripulous M , Piquette-Miller M Background: Auto-immune arthritic diseases<disease> affect many women of child-bearing age. Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α inhibitors are currently used for the treatment of various immune-mediated diseases<disease> during pregnancy. However , there has been no evaluation of safety in the treatment of arthritic diseases<disease> during gestation. Objective: To analyze the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes after treatment of arthritic diseases<disease> with TNF-α inhibitors. Methods: Major databases including Ovid MEDLINE , Embase , and Web of Science , were searched inclusive to April 2016. Observational prospective cohort studies evaluating pregnancy outcomes after exposure to TNF-α inhibitors for the treatment of arthritic diseases<disease> during pregnancy were included. Data on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes was extracted from all included studies. A meta-analysis was performed using inverse-variance random effect with a 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) and p < 0.05. Results: Eight prospective studies with comparison groups were included in the meta-analysis. TNF-α inhibitors were associated with significantly higher risks of low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight<symptom> ( odds ratio ( OR) , 1.43; 95 % CI , 1.00-2.04) and significantly lower rates of live birth ( OR , 0.61; 95 % CI , 0.38-0.98). However , birth defects , therapeutic abortion<disease> , spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> , and preterm birth were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Treatment of arthritic diseases<disease> with TNF-α inhibitors during pregnancy increases the risk of lower birth weight<symptom> and decreases the rate of live birth in this population. While duration of treatment and gestational age at exposure may play a role in these outcomes , evaluation of risk versus benefit is crucial in this patient population. Key words: TNF-α inhibitors , pregnancy outcomes , arthritic disease<disease> , meta-analysis.
