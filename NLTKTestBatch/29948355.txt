 The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effectiveness of splinting and Kinesio taping ( KT) as forms of treatment for patients with mild to moderate idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome<symptom> ( CTS) by evaluating the symptoms<symptom> and measuring the range of function and electrophysiological findings. This single-blind , randomized , prospective study included 44 patients ( 58 hands) suffering mild to moderate idiopathic CTS according to nerve conduction studies ( NCS). The patients were randomized into two groups and evaluated before treatment and 6 weeks after treatment by means of physical examination findings , NCS , and the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire ( BCTQ) functional status<symptom> and symptom<symptom> severity scale scores. When the differences in both groups before and after treatment were compared , a significant improvement was observed in the KT group compared to the splint group in terms of electrophysiological changes , provocative test responses , BCTQ symptom<symptom> severity , and functional status<symptom> scores. KT may help prevent the disease<disease> from progressing further in mild and moderate idiopathic CTS when applied in time using the appropriate technique and be a good alternative to neutral splinting in terms of patient compliance.
