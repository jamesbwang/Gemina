 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of partial arch repair using the frozen elephant trunk ( FET) technique for distal arch aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> and to examine the late complications. Thirty-eight patients with true distal arch aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> were repaired with FET introduced through an incision in the proximal arch aorta. Follow-up computed tomography was performed every 6 or 12 months in 36 surviving patients. The maximum dimension of the excluded aneurysmal space was measured to determine whether the aneurysmal space had decreased or disappeared. Late complications were also evaluated during the long-term follow-up. There was 1 hospital death ( 2.6 %) and 1 ( 2.6 %) case of paraplegia<symptom>. There were 2 late sudden deaths ( 5.2 %) thought to be due to aneurysm<disease> rupture and arrhythmia. Postoperative serial-computed tomography showed shrinkage of the excluded aneurysmal space in 33 of 36 patients. Late aneurysmal formation occurred in the anastomotic site in three patients. One patient underwent thoracic endovascular stent grafting 10 years after surgery , 1 patient had total arch replacement 9 years after surgery , and 1 died due to rupture. Frozen elephant trunk was found to be a useful alternative for treating true distal arch aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease>. However , we must be alert for late aneurysmal formation at the incision site.
