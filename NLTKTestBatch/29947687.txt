 Cancer patients present various physiological , metabolic , social and emotional changes as a consequence of the disease<disease> 's own catabolism , and may be potentiated in the gastrointestinal tract<symptom> cancer by their interference with food intake , digestion and absorption. o evaluate the functionality of upper gastrointestinal cancer patients which have undertaken surgery and analyze the factors associated with changes in strength and functionality during hospitalization time. Prospective analytical study in patients with cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract<symptom> which have undertaken surgery. Was evaluated the handgrip strength using a hand dynamometer and functionality through the functional independence measure and Functional Status<symptom> Scale for Intensive Care Unit in the preoperative period , 2nd and 7th postoperative day. Were included 12 patients , 75 % men , and mean age was 58.17 years old. The most prevalent tumor site was stomach ( 66.7 %). There was a progressive reduction from the pre-operative palmar grip strength to the 2nd and 7th postoperative day , respectively. There was a decrease in functional performance from the preoperative period to the 2nd and a gain from the 2nd to the 7th postoperative day ( p < 0.001). An important reduction in the handgrip strength and functionality was evidenced during the postoperative period in relation to the basal value in the pre-operative period.
