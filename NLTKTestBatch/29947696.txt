 Body mass index ( BMI) has some limitations for nutritional diagnosis since it does not represent an accurate measure of body fat and it is unable to identify predominant fat distribution. To develop a BMI based on the ratio of trunk mass and height. Fifty-seven patients in preoperative evaluation to bariatric surgery were evaluated. The preoperative anthropometric evaluation assessed weight<symptom> , height and BMI. The body composition was evaluated by bioimpedance , obtaining the trunk fat free mass and fat mass , and trunk height. Trunk BMI ( tBMI) was calculated by the sum of the measurements of the trunk fat free mass ( tFFM) and trunk fat mass ( tFM) in kg , divided by the trunk height squared ( m2)). The calculation of the trunk fat BMI ( tfBMI) was calculated by tFM , in kg , divided by the trunk height squared ( m2)). For the correction and adjustment of the tBMI and tfBMI , it was calculated the relation between trunk extension and height , multiplying by the obtained indexes. The mean data was: weight<symptom> 125.3 ± 19.5 kg , height 1.63 ± 0.1 m , BMI was 47 ± 5 kg/m2) and trunk height was 0.52 ± 0,1 m , tFFM was 29.05 ± 4,8 kg , tFM was 27.2 ± 3.7 kg , trunk mass index was 66.6 ± 10.3 kg/m ² , and trunk fat was 32.3 ± 5.8 kg/m ². In 93 % of the patients there was an increase in obesity class using the tBMI. In patients with grade III obesity the tBMI reclassified to super obesity in 72 % of patients and to super-super obesity in 24 % of the patients. The trunk BMI is simple and allows a new reference for the evaluation of the body mass distribution , and therefore a new reclassification of the obesity class , evidencing the severity of obesity in a more objectively way.
