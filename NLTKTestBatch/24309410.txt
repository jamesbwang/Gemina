 With globalization and rapid urbanization , demographic and epidemiologic transitions have become important determinants for the emergence of cardiovascular disease<disease> ( CVD). To estimate the prevalence of CVD risk factors in adult out-patients attending general practice and non-specialist clinics in urban and rural Nigeria. As part of the Africa and Middle East Cardiovascular Epidemiological ( ACE) study , a cross-sectional epidemiologic study was undertaken for the presence of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , obesity , smoking and abdominal obesity in Nigeria. In total , 303 subjects from 8 out-patient general practice clinics were studied , 184 ( 60.7 %) were female and 119 ( 39.3 %) were male. Mean age was 42.7 ± 13.1 years; 51.8 % were aged < 45 years; 4 % ≥ 65 years. Over 90 % of subjects had ≥ 1 of 6 selected modifiable cardiovascular risk factors: 138 ( 45.6 %) had 1-2; 65 ( 21.5 %) had 3; 60 ( 19.8 %) had 4; and 11 ( 3.6 %) had 5 concurrent risk factors. Screening identified 206 subjects ( 68.0 %) with dyslipidemia who did not have a prior diagnosis. Cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent in Nigerian subjects attending out-patient clinics. Moreover , many subjects were undiagnosed and therefore unaware of their cardiovascular risk status<symptom>. Opportunistic screening alongside intensive national , multisectoral education or risk factor education is needed , should be scaled up nationwide and rolled out in both urban and rural communities in Nigeria.
