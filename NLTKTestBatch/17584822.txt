 Endometriosis is a chronic benign disease<disease> that affects women of reproductive age. Medical therapy is often the first line of management for women with endometriosis in order to ameliorate symptoms<symptom> or to prevent post-surgical disease<disease> recurrence. Currently , there are several medical options for the management of patients with endometriosis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions , being efficacious in relieving primary dysmenorrhea. Combined oral contraceptives ( COCs) and progestins , available for multiple routes of administration , are effective first-line hormonal options. In fact , several randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) demonstrated that they succeed in improving pain symptoms<symptom> in the majority of patients , are well tolerated and not expensive. Second-line therapy is represented by gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH) agonists. Even if these drugs are efficacious in treating women not responding to COCs or progestins , they are not orally available and have a less favorable tolerability profile ( needing an appropriate add-back therapy). The use of danazol is limited by the large availability of other better-tolerated hormonal drugs. Because few data are available on long-term efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors they should be administered only in women with symptoms<symptom> refractory to other conventional therapies in a clinical research setting. Promising preliminary data have emerged from multicenter Phase III trials on elagolix , a new oral GnRH antagonist but non-inferiority RCT data are required to compare elagolix with first-line therapies for endometriosis.
