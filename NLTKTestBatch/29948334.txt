 Antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV<pathogen> infection<disease> has become increasingly effective. Persistent poor HIV<pathogen> outcomes in racial and ethnic minority populations in the US call for a closer examination into why Latinos are at significant risk for acquiring and dying from HIV<pathogen>. To improve clinical outcomes and achieve an AIDS-free generation , HIV<pathogen> research must address disparities in HIV<pathogen> outcomes in Latinos , the largest ethnic/racial minority population in the US. Immigrant status<symptom> as well as cultural factors influence HIV<pathogen> care utilization and are essential to highlight for effective intervention development in Latinos. A better understanding of these individual and contextual factors is critical to developing tailored approaches to engaging Latinos in HIV<pathogen> care. Based on a comprehensive literature review , we offer a framework for understanding what is needed from clinical practice and research to improve engagement in HIV<pathogen> care for US-based Latinos. These findings may have implications for other minority populations.
