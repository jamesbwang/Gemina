 To introduce an innovative surgical technique named as trans-vertebral bone graft and augmentation ( TBGA) and evaluate its clinical efficacy with balloon Kyphoplasty ( BKP) as control for osteoporotic VCFs. A total of 81 patients with one-level osteoporotic VCFs received the TBGA ( n = 38) or BKP ( n = 43) from October 2012 to January 2015. The average follow-up period of the patients was 27.9 months. The patients were evaluated using plain radiographs , computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively. The radiological examinations were performed after surgery and then at 3- and 6-month follow-up. The subsequent follow-up examinations were performed at every 6 months interval. Clinical status<symptom> was assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) and the visual analogue scale ( VAS) scores. In addition , parameters of anterior vertebral body height ( AVBH) , kyphosis angle ( KA) , adjacent segment degeneration ( ASD) and complications were also compared between the two groups. There were significant clinical improvements on ODI , VAS , AVBH and KA in both TBGA and BKP groups after surgery , respectively ( P < 0.05). However , differences in improvements on ODI and VAS between the TBGA and BKP groups were not statistically significant ( P > 0.05). Better improvements on AVBH and KA were achieved in TBGA group compared with BKP group ( P < 0.05). Furthermore , incidences of ASD and complications in TBGA group were significantly lower than the BKP group during the follow-up period ( P < 0.05). TBGA is an effective and safe surgical technique , and could be used as a promising alternative to BKP in surgical treatment of osteoporotic VCFs.
