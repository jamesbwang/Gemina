 The CO2 electroreduction reaction has been investigated on Cu ( 100) and Cu ( 111) surfaces in 0.1 M KClO4 , KCl , KBr and KI electrolytes. The formation of ethylene ( C2H4) and ethanol ( EtOH) products on these surfaces generally increased as the electrolyte anion was changed from ClO4- → Cl- → Br- → I-. For example , on Cu ( 100) at -1.23 V vs. RHE , as the electrolyte anion changed from ClO4- to I- , the Faradaic efficiencies of ethylene ( FEethylene) improved from 31 to 50 % , FEethanol increased from 7 to 16 % , and the current densities of ethylene and ethanol showed respectively 5 and 7 folds enhancement. A remarkable total FE up to 74 % for C2 and C3 products were also obtained in the KI electrolyte. Despite their roughening in the presence of the electrolytes , the Cu ( 100) electrode still showed a greater propensity than Cu ( 111) for enhancing the formation of C2 compounds. The favorable reduction of CO2 to C2 products in KI electrolyte was correlated with a higher * CO population on the surface , as shown using linear sweep voltammetry. In situ Raman spectroscopy indicates that the coordination<symptom> environment of * CO was altered by the electrolyte anion used. Thus , apart from affecting the morphology of the electrode and local pH , we propose that the anion plays a critical role in enhancing the formation of C2 products , by tuning the coordination<symptom> environment of adsorbed * CO for more efficient C-C coupling.
