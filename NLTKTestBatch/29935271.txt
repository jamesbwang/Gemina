 Heat shock<symptom> proteins ( HSP or stress proteins) are intracellular molecules that participate in physiological cell metabolism and growth , although they are known to be involved in many stress conditions. Statins inhibit the action of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase ( HMG-CoA) , which is important in the synthesis of cholesterol and essential isoprenoid intermediates , thereby lowering circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL) , a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease<disease> ( CVD). This review provides new insights into the mechanisms of action of statins in the regulation of HSPs. A better understanding of this involvement can help in development of new and more effective treatment strategies for CVD.
