 To correlate the endoscopic characteristics with the histopathology of specimens of esophageal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia obtained by endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD). This was a retrospective study developed from January 2010 to December 2015. The study included 169 patients who underwent ESD and were diagnosed with esophageal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia according to endoscopic forceps biopsy , Lugol staining , endoscopic ultrasonography , computed tomography , and Narrow-Band Imaging. The demographic , endoscopic , and histopathologic characteristics were analyzed. A total of 19 cases ( 11.2 %) had a change in diagnosis after histopathology exam and 16 ( 9.5 %) needed a change in established treatment. An increase in the severity of disease<disease> was correlated with a lesion<symptom> size > 2 cm , less than 4 samples in biopsy , and depressed or excavated patterns ( p < 0.05). One hundred forty patients ( 82.8 %) underwent curative resection. Lesions<symptom> with leukoplakia ( p < 0.001) and negative Lugol staining ( p = 0.028) were independent risk factor for non-curative resection. This study confirms that lesion<symptom> size > 2 cm , depressed and excavated patterns , and â‰¤ 4 biopsy samples are independent risk factors for histological grade changes compared to pre-endoscopic treatment diagnosis. Similarly , leukoplakia and no Lugol staining of lesions<symptom> are independent risk factors for non-curative resection.
