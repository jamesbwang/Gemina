 A low protein diet ( LPD) with essential amino acid ketoanalogue supplementation ( KA) may contribute in improving of chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD) , while the exact mechanisms of KA 's effect are not established yet. We have conducted a prospective , randomized , controlled comparative study of LPD + KA and LPD alone in relation to serum Klotho , FGF-23 levels in CKD patients. 79 non-diabetic CKD 3b-4 stage patients , compliant with LPD diet ( 0.6 g/kg of body weight/day) , had been selected. The patients were randomized into two groups. The first group ( 42 patients) received LPD + КA. The second group ( 37 patients) continued the LРD alone. In addition to routine tests , serum Klotho , FGF-23 levels , as well as bioimpedance analysis , sphygmography ( stiffness ( augmentation) indices ( AI) , central ( aortal) blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>) with a `` SphygmaCor '' device; echocardiography ( valvular calcification score ( VCS) and LVMMI) , were performed. There were body mass indices ' decrease ( p = 0.046) , including muscle<symptom> body mass in men ( p = 0.027) and woman ( p = 0.044) in the LPD group to the end of study ( 14th month). In addition , lower FGF-23 ( p = 0.029) , and higher sKlotho ( p = 0.037) were detected in the LPD + KA group compared to the LPD one. The increase in AI ( p = 0.034) , VCS ( p = 0.048) , and LVMMI ( p = 0.023) was detected more often in the LPD group at the end of study. LPD + KA provides support for nutrition status<symptom> and contributes to more efficient correction of FGF-23 and Klotho abnormalities that may result in cardiovascular calcification and cardiac remodeling decreasing in CKD. At the same time , a prolonged LPD alone may lead to malnutrition.
