 Essential tremor<symptom> ( ET) is very common , but characterization is difficult because of its heterogeneity. Neuropathology is important to elucidate the characteristics of neurological disorders. However , pathological findings in ET have been inconsistent among studies. Uric acid ( UA) is a strong antioxidant and might be a biomarker in neurodegenerative process. We hypothesized that UA level would be reduced if ET is a neurodegenerative disease<disease>. Our aim was to compare UA level between ET patients and healthy individuals. This was a prospective , case-control , multicenter study with 92 ET patients and 77 healthy subjects. For homogeneity , the ET group was subdivided into two groups ( hereditary and sporadic). Clinical and laboratory findings were compared among the ET and healthy groups. The demographic characteristics were comparable among the groups. The UA level was lower in the ET group than in healthy subjects , but the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was a negative correlation between UA level and disease<disease> duration in the hereditary group ( p = 0.046) and between UA level and age at onset in the sporadic group ( p = 0.012). The mean values of total cholesterol were significantly lower in the sporadic group than in the other groups ( p = 0.011). Total cholesterol was positively correlated with age at onset in the hereditary ET group ( p = 0.010). We did not find any evidence that UA levels suggested ET is a neurodegenerative disease<disease>. However , further research with more patients might be needed given the negative correlations of disease<disease> duration and age at onset with UA level.
