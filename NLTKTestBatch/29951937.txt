 Associations between the overall quality of Japanese diets and metabolic risk factors are largely unknown. This cross-sectional study investigated this issue using data from the 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey , Japan. Dietary intake was assessed by a 1-day weighed dietary record in 15,618 Japanese adults aged â‰¥ 20 years. Overall diet quality was assessed by adherence to the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top ( JFG score) , its modified version ( modified JFG score) , the Mediterranean diet score ( MDS) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH) score. Metabolic risk factors included BMI , waist circumference , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , total , HDL- and LDL-cholesterol and glycated haemoglobin. While DASH score was consistently associated with favourable nutrient intake patterns ( including higher micronutrient and dietary fibre intakes and lower SFA and sodium intakes) , other scores were associated with both favourable and unfavourable aspects ( e.g. , lower micronutrient intakes for JFG score , higher SFA intakes for modified JFG score and higher sodium intakes for MDS). The associations with metabolic risk factors were also inconsistent and unexpected , including positive associations of JFG and modified JFG scores with LDL-cholesterol , inverse associations of MDS with HDL-cholesterol and null associations of DASH score with blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. This study did not show expected and consistent associations of the four available diet quality scores with nutrient intakes and metabolic risk factors in Japanese adults. This in turn suggests the need for a scientific base on which to develop an appropriate tool for assessing the quality of diets in the Japanese context.
