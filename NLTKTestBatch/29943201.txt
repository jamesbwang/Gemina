 We sought to characterize the clinical , neuropsychological , electrophysiological , and neuroimaging features of Parkinson 's disease<disease> ( PD) after over 35 years since the onset of motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. Five consecutively consenting PD patients treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation ( STN-DBS) were recruited in a cross-sectional study of motor ( Unified PD Rating Scale section-III) , non-motor ( Non-Motor Symptoms<symptom> Scale) , autonomic ( Scale for Outcome in PD-Autonomic) , and neuropsychological features associated with the very advanced phase of PD. In addition , patients underwent neurophysiological ( autonomic tests and nerve conduction studies) and neuroimaging ( brain MRI , There was a sustained motor<symptom> response<symptom> to L-dopa ( range 14.4-35.6 %) , STN-DBS ( 23.3-38.4 %) , and L-dopa plus STN-DBS ( 37.8-63.0 %). There were mild-to-moderate non-motor symptoms<symptom> ( range 19-83 on a scale of 0 to 360) and autonomic dysfunction ( 8-28 on a scale of 0-69). Two patients were demented , one had mild cognitive impairment , and two were cognitively preserved. Three patients had a sensory-axonal peripheral neuropathy and two a moderate-to-severe autonomic neuropathy. All cases showed a complete nigro-striatal dopaminergic denervation and a severe cardiovascular noradrenergic denervation. The brain MRI revealed only moderate frontal atrophy. The genetic tests were unremarkable. Even after more than 35 years of disease<disease> , L-dopa and STN-DBS remain effective on PD cardinal symptoms<symptom>. Although axial , autonomic , and neuropsychological features may become key determinants of disability , some patients maintain a satisfactory quality of life , without significant motor and non-motor impairment.
