 The widespread desire to maintain youth and beauty with minimally invasive procedures made the use of soft<disease> tissue fillers an attractive option to correct numerous aesthetic problems. However , many complications have emerged recently especially with the use of non-FDA-approved permanent materials. In this case report , we are demonstrating the effective management of a patient with Brucella isolated from a facial<symptom> abscess<symptom> at the site of prior permanent filler injection done 17 years ago. A 56-year-old woman presented complaining of painful swelling of the right cheek after a failed trial of filler evacuation and intralesional corticosteroid injection. The patient was interviewed carefully , and physical examination was performed , followed by culture and imaging. The patient had a facial<symptom> abscess<symptom> that was complicated by parotid<symptom> infiltration by Brucella. Eventually she was managed successfully by anti-Brucella antibiotics for 6 months with no further complaints. A review of causative organisms in the literature along with recommendations for management is discussed. Permanent fillers have shown many complications that can occur even years after injection. Therefore , physicians should be careful when using permanent fillers and should restrict their use to certain situations. Moreover , rare infections<disease> must be kept in mind and careful history , including travel history and animal contact , needs to be considered particularly in the unusual scenarios.
