 The current study aimed to determine the effects of sildenafil-associated aerobic exercise training ( ET) on the physical performance , hemodynamic , autonomic and inflammatory parameters of rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to: sedentary rats placebo-treated ( SP); sedentary rats sildenafil-treated ( SS); trained rats placebo-treated ( TP); and trained rats sildenafil-treated ( TS). Sildenafil treatment consisted of 8 weeks of daily oral gavage ( 1.5 mg/kg) , one hour before the session of ET ( 60-75 % of maximal running speed , 5 days/week , for 8 weeks). After ET period , physical capacity , hemodynamic , autonomic and skeletal muscle inflammatory profile were assessed. Chronic sildenafil treatment causes an additional increase of physical capacity in aerobically trained rats. However , these beneficial effects were accompanied by unwanted alterations , as increased of arterial pressure and peripheral sympathetic modulation , as well as exacerbated inflammatory status<symptom> on skeletal muscle of rats. Taken together , these data suggest the positive and negative effects of sildenafil chronic administration , associated to aerobic ET , at doses used in clinical practice. This report stresses the importance of paying greater attention to the indiscriminate use of this substance in high-performance sports.
