 This study aimed to investigate the electrical activity of two muscles located at the dorsal surface during Islamic prayer ( Salat). Specifically , the electromyography ( EMG) activity of the erector spinae and trapezius muscles during four positions observed while performing Salat , namely standing , bowing , sitting and prostration<symptom> , were investigated. Seven adult subjects with an average age of 28.1 ( Â± 3.8) years were included in the study. EMG data were obtained from their trapezius and erector spinae muscles while the subjects maintained the specific positions of Salat. The EMG signal was analysed using time and frequency domain features. The results indicate that the trapezius muscle remains relaxed during the standing and sitting positions and the erector spinae muscle remains contracted during these two positions. Additionally , during the bowing and prostration<symptom> positions of Salat , these two muscles exhibit the opposite activities: the trapezius muscle remains contracted while the erector spinae muscle remains relaxed. Overall , both muscles maintain a balance in terms of contraction and relaxation during bowing and prostration<symptom> position. The irregularity of the neuro-muscular signal might cause pain and prevent Muslims from performing their obligatory prayer. This study will aid the accurate understanding of how the back muscles respond in specific postures<symptom> during Salat.
