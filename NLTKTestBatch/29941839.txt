 An outbreak of occupational methanol poisoning<disease> occurred in small-scale , third-tier factories of large-scale smartphone manufacturers in the Republic of Korea in 2016. To investigate the working environment and the health effects of methanol exposure among co-workers in the methanol poisoning<disease> cases , we performed a cross-sectional study on 155 workers at five aluminum Computerized Numerical Control ( CNC) cutting factories. Gas chromatography measured air and urinary methanol concentration. In the medical examination , symptom<symptom> surveys , ophthalmological examinations , and neurobehavioral tests were done. Multiple logistic regression analyses controlling for age and sex were conducted to reveal the association of employment duration with symptoms<symptom>. Air concentrations of methanol in factory A and E ranged from 228.5 to 2220.0 ppm. Mean urinary methanol concentrations of the workers in each factory were from 3.5 mg/L up to 91.2 mg/L. The odds ratios for symptoms<symptom> of deteriorating vision and central nervous system ( CNS) increased according to the employment duration after adjusting for age and sex. Four cases with an injured optic nerve and two cases with decreased neurobehavioral function were founded among co-workers of the victims. This study showed that the methanol exposure under poor environmental control not only produces eye and CNS symptoms<symptom> but also affects neurobehavioral function and the optic nerve. The role of subcontracting production and dispatched work under poor environmental control was discussed.
