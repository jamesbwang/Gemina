 The Origin of Life Domain ( OLD) is the period during which life on Earth began. Here we derive and use a new phylogenetic algorithm to analyze Protein Families in order to reconstruct the chronological steps by which the OLD evolved. During this period , life began with the appearance of the fundamental components of life such as RNAs , DNAs , amino acids , and membranes<symptom>. Chronologically the Origin of Life preceded the Last Universal Common<disease> Ancestor ( LUCA) , which then subsequently engendered modern life on Earth. Our phylogenetic algorithm allows us to explicitly answer previously unknown origin of life questions. Specifically , we explain and illustrate our computational methods by reconstructing the rings describing the evolution of the RNA and DNA worlds. We phylogenetically reconstruct how the RNA and DNA worlds evolved , infer the origins and chronological order of appearance of the first genetic codes , test whether the Ribosomal RNA world preceded the Membrane world , and interpret these new findings with respect to the experimental and theoretical origin of life studies by others.
