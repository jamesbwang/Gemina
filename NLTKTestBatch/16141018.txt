 The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of the bedside lung ultrasound in emergency ( BLUE) protocol in giving a correct diagnosis in patients presenting with acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> respiratory distress in emergency department. Patients with acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> respiratory distress were evaluated. Ultrasound findings such as artifacts ( A line , B line) , lung sliding , alveolar consolidation or pleural effusion<symptom> , and venous analysis were recorded. Ultrasonography findings were correlated with final diagnosis made by the treating unit. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. A total 50 patients were evaluated. The A profile ( predominant A line with lung sliding) indicated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma ( BLUE protocol was successful in average 90.316 % cases. BLUE performed in emergency department is equivalent to computed tomography scan. BLUE protocol aids in making diagnosis and saves time and cost; avoids the side effects related to radiation.
