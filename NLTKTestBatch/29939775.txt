 To investigate functional and anatomical results up to 12 months after Descemet 's membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK) for Fuchs ' endothelial dystrophy ( FED) versus bullous keratopathy ( BK) in consideration of morphologic characteristics on host 's endothelium-Descemet 's membranes<symptom> ( EDM). In a prospective consecutive case series , 119 eyes underwent a primary DMEK for FED or BK. Intraoperatively obtained EDM were investigated immunohistologically. Clinical and morphological parameters were compared between FED and BK. Overall , the 12-months best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) was 0.14 logMAR , and 0.10 logMAR in eyes without vision-limiting comorbidities; thereby no differences were revealed between eyes with FED and BK up to 12 months postoperative ( p = 0.186 and p = 0.095 , respectively). Correspondingly , the mean central corneal thickness ( CCT) measured 520 vs. 529 Âµm and the mean endothelial cell density ( ECD) was 1743 vs. 1457 cells/mm DMEK produces similar results for FED and BK. However , the postoperative course may differ with regard to the recurrence of secondary graft detachments that may be associated by histopathologic particularities.
