 Use of the unregulated herbal supplement kratom is on the rise in the United States. We present a case series of 2 patients who developed kratom dependence and withdrawal<symptom> who were successfully transitioned to buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance. Two patients using kratom to self-treat chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> after prescription opioids were discontinued presenting to our clinic with evidence of kratom dependence and withdrawal<symptom>. On examination , both patients showed signs of mild opioid withdrawal<symptom>. Both patients were successfully transitioned to buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance via home initiation with control of both their opioid withdrawal<symptom> and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Kratom use is on the rise and with increasing evidence of developing opioid-type dependence due to chronic kratom use. This case series shows that buprenorphine can be used to treat kratom dependence and underlying chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> that drives it use.
