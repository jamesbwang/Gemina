 The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether or not patients scheduled for the reirradiation of a previously treated target volume report reduced levels of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> , compared to patients receiving their first course of palliative radiotherapy , e.g. , because they are familiar with the process of treatment planning and delivery. A retrospective comparison of two groups of patients ( 37 % reirradiated , overall 102 patients) , which scored their symptoms<symptom> before palliative radiotherapy with the Edmonton symptom<symptom> assessment system ( ESAS). The two groups differed significantly with regard to the incidence of bone metastases , which was higher in the reirradiation group. Mean anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> scores were not significantly different between the two groups. The same was true for the proportion of patients with symptom<symptom> scores â‰¥ 4. Analyses limited to patients treated for bone metastases revealed no significant differences either. Survival was similar , too. The facts that similar ESAS scores of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> were observed and that prognosis was comparable suggest that the magnitude of these symptoms<symptom> might be associated with the presence of incurable cancer itself ( or the related somatic symptom<symptom> burden) rather than the setting in which palliative radiotherapy is performed.
