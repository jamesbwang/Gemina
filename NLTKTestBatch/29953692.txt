 This study examined differential patterns of time spent using social media in a sample of 457 adolescents over a 6-year period. The majority of adolescents ( 83 %) , termed moderate users , reported steady social media use over time. A second group ( increasers: 12 %) reported low social media use that increased gradually and ended high at the end of the study. A third group , called peak users ( 6 %) , reported low social media that increased quickly after a few years and then returned to baseline levels. Low self-regulation predicted being an increaser or peak user. Being a moderate user tended to be related to lower levels of depression<symptom> , aggression , delinquency , social media problems , and cyberbullying across time , as compared with the other groups.
