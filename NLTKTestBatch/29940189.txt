 Nervous necrosis<symptom> virus<pathogen> ( NNV) is a ubiquitous pathogen in the aquaculture worldwide. Little is known about the relationship between NNV virus<pathogen> and host cells. Our studies showed that RGNNV infection could induce cell cycle arrest via activation of p53 signaling in cultured host cells. Infection of RGNNV redistributed NPM1 , stabilized p53 and inhibited cell proliferation by inducing G1 arrest. RGNNV infection also led to phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore , RGNNV infection upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A ( p21) and downregulated cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2). The expression of genes in the p53 pathway did not change significantly after p53 knockdown by pifithrin-Î± during RGNNV infection. However , NPM1 knockdown could abrogate RGNNV-induced cell proliferation inhibition , activation of p53 signaling and cell cycle arrest. In addition , RGNNV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed that viral genomic RNA and virus<pathogen> titer were higher in the cells released from G1 phase- or S phase-synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G2 phase-synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18 h p.i. Therefore , our study reveals that RGNNV infection induces the p53-dependent pathway , resulting in a cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in host cells , which might provide a favorable condition for viral replication.
