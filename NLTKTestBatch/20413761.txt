 Diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI) has been shown to be an important component of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI). We compared performance of DWI for detection of prostate cancer ( PCa) in peripheral zone ( PZ) and transition zone ( TZ) of prostate. We reviewed data of 460 subjects who underwent preoperative 3.0-Tesla mpMRI and subsequently radical prostatectomy. Level of suspicion for PCa was graded using 5-grade Likert-scale from DWI. Topographic analyses were performed for location of tumor foci at each surgical specimen. Among those with DWI grade ≥ III , we analyzed concordance rate on the location of radiologic and pathologic index lesions<symptom> between DWI and surgical specimens. Among 460 patients , 351 ( 76.3 %) patients showed suspicious DWI lesions<symptom> ( 57.5 % in PZ , 42.5 % in TZ). Multivariates regression analyses revealed significant associations between high DWI grade and adverse pathologic outcomes including pathologic stage , Gleason score , tumor volume and extracapsular extension ( all p < 0.05). Overall concordance rates between DWI and surgical specimen were 75.8 % , significantly higher in PZ than TZ ( 82.2 % vs. 67.1 % p = 0.002). Such concordance rate showed a positive linear association with increase in DWI grading ( p < 0.001). Among 109 patients with DWI grade I-II , 28 ( 25.7 %) harbored high grade disease<disease> ( pathologic Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3). DWI detects tumors in PZ of prostate more accurately than those in TZ. Such accuracy of DWI was shown to be more evident with higher DWI grade. Meanwhile , a negative DWI did not guarantee absence of high grade PCa.
