 It is now clear that the majority of transcription in humans results in the production of long non-protein-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) with a variable length spanning from 200 bp up to several kilobases. To date , we have a limited understanding of the lncRNA function , but a huge number of evidences have suggested that lncRNAs represent an outstanding asset for cells. In particular , temporal and spatial expression of lncRNAs appears to be important for proper neurological functioning. Stunningly , abnormal lncRNA function has been found as being critical for the onset of neurological disorders. This chapter focus on the lncRNAs with a role in diseases<disease> affecting the central nervous system with particular regard for the lncRNAs causing those neurodegenerative diseases<disease> that exhibit dementia and/or motor<symptom> dysfunctions<symptom>. A specific section will be dedicated to the human neuronal lncRNAs that have been modelled in Drosophila. Finally , even if only few examples have been reported so far , an overview of the Drosophila lncRNAs with neurological functions will be also included in this chapter.
