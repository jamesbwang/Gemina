 Prior to 2013 , genetic testing for Ashkenazi Jewish ( AJ) individuals primarily consisted of the three-site BRCA1/BRCA2 AJ panel , full sequencing of BRCA1/2 , or the Lynch syndrome<symptom> mismatch repair genes. Multigene panel testing became more widely available in 2013 , but limited data are available regarding the impact of multigene panel testing for AJ individuals. Here , we report the frequency of cancer susceptibility gene mutations in a cohort of 427 AJ individuals seen in the Cancer Risk Clinic at The University of Chicago. We found that 29 % of affected and 37 % of unaffected individuals carried a pathogenic mutation ( 32 % of overall cohort) , primarily known familial mutations in BRCA1/2. A minority of mutations were identified in non-BRCA1/ 2 genes and consisted mainly of AJ founder mutations in CHEK2 , APC , and the mismatch repair genes. A panel of AJ founder mutations would have identified the majority ( 94 %) of mutations in clinically actionable genes in both affected and unaffected patients. Based on recent cost-effectiveness studies , offering all AJ individuals a founder mutation panel may be a cost-effective cancer prevention strategy.
