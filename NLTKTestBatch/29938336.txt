 The mechanism of action of fingolimod within the central nervous system and its efficacy in reducing/preventing both focal and diffuse grey matter ( GM) damage in active multiple sclerosis ( MS) are not completely understood. In this longitudinal , 2-year prospective , phase IV , single-blind study , 40 MS patients treated with fingolimod and 39 untreated age , gender , and disability-matched MS patients were enrolled. Each patient underwent a neurological examination every 6 months and a 3T MRI at the beginning of the treatment and after 24 months. The accumulation of new cortical lesions<symptom> ( CLs) and the progression of regional GM atrophy were compared between the two groups. At the end of the study ( T24) , the percentage of patients with new CLs ( 13.5 vs. 89 % , p < 0.001) and the percentage of GM volume change was lower in the treated group ( p < 0.001). The regional analysis revealed that the treated group had also less volume loss in thalamus , caudatus , globus pallidus , cingulate cortex , and hippocampus ( p < 0.001) , as well as in , cerebellum , superior frontal gyrus , and insular-long gyrus ( p < 0.05). Patients with no evidence of disease<disease> activity were 60 % in the treated group and 10 % in the untreated group ( p < 0.001). These results suggest a possible protective effect of fingolimod on focal and diffuse GM damage.
