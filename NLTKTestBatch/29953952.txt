 Emerging evidence indicates that vitamin D has anti-oxidative properties. The present study investigates whether serum 25‑hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D) is associated with biomarkers of anti-oxidative status<symptom> in community-dwelling older adults using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. A total of 302 subjects aged 62 to 92 years from Germany ( 50.6 ° N) were analysed via cross-sectional approach. For longitudinal analysis , data of 153 subjects were available. Fasting blood samples from 2004 and 2012 were analysed for 25 ( OH) D concentrations , total anti-oxidative status<symptom> ( TAOS) as well as anti-oxidative enzymes , such as catalase ( CAT) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD). Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between 25 ( OH) D and parameters of anti-oxidative status<symptom>. In cross-sectional analyses , 25 ( OH) D was a significant predictor of CAT ( β = -0.166; P = 0.010) , lg The maintenance of an adequate vitamin D status<symptom> may have a beneficial impact on the anti-oxidative defence system in older adults on a long-term perspective.
