 Intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) is the most feared complication in patients treated with oral anticoagulants due to non-valvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( NVAF). Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants ( NOACs) reduce the risk of ICH compared to vitamin K antagonists ( VKAs). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of fatal NOAC-related ICH compared to VKA-related ICH. We calculated the corresponding risk ratios ( RRs) in each included study to express the relative risk of fatal ICH among all patients receiving oral anticoagulation with either NOACs or VKAs. We additionally evaluated the mortality rates in NOAC-related and VKA-related ICH in patients treated with and without NOAC-specific reversal agents ( idarucizumab and factor Xa inhibitors antidote). Case fatality was evaluated at 30-90 days following symptom<symptom> onset. Our literature search identified 6 eligible studies ( 4 RCTs and 2 open-label trials of NOAC-specific reversal agents). In pairwise analyses NOACs were found to have lower risk of fatal ICH compared to VKAs ( RR = 0.46 , 95 % CI: 0.36-0.58) with no heterogeneity ( I NOACs halve the risk of fatal ICH in NVAF patients compared to VKAs , while indirect comparisons indicate that NOAC-specific reversal agents may be associated with lower case fatality rate in NOAC-related ICH.
