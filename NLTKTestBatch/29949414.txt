 The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of unroofed coronary sinus ( CS) syndrome<symptom> at a tertiary hospital and analyze the clinical information , cardiovascular CT angiography ( CCTA) imaging findings , associated anomalies , and surgical treatment of the identified cases. We retrospectively searched the database of a tertiary hospital for cases of unroofed CS syndrome<symptom> among patients who underwent CCTA for known or suspected congenital heart disease<disease>. After the prevalence of unroofed CS syndrome<symptom> was determined , CCTA findings , associated cardiovascular abnormalities , presence or absence of airway compression , clinical information , and surgical outcome were recorded. A total of 23 patients with unroofed CS syndrome<symptom> were identified , with the syndrome<symptom> therefore having a prevalence of 0.36 % among patients with congenital heart disease<disease> who underwent CCTA. The diagnostic accuracy of CCTA for unroofed CS syndrome<symptom> was 100 % , whereas that of echocardiography was 69 %. Type I unroofed CS syndrome<symptom> was the most commonly noted type ( 52 % of patients). All 23 patients had associated cardiovascular anomalies , including persistent left superior vena cava ( 65 % of patients) and atrial septal defect ( 65 %). Surgery was performed for 70 % of patients because of cardiovascular anomalies. Seven patients ( 30 %) had associated secondary airway compression but did not require surgical correction. At our institution , the prevalence of unroofed CS syndrome<symptom> was 0.36 % among patients with congenital heart disease<disease> who underwent CCTA. CCTA has excellent diagnostic performance , delineating different subtypes of unroofed CS syndrome<symptom> and associated cardiovascular planning for treatment of unroofed CS syndrome<symptom> abnormalities , improving clinical decision making , and permitting preoperative planning for treatment of unroofed CS syndrome<symptom>.
