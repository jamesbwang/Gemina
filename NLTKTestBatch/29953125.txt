 France is known as one of the countries where psychoanalysis still holds an important position in various fields , and specially in psychiatry. Is it a ` culture bound syndrome<symptom> ' of French society , or , more seriously , a particularity that could be useful in other contexts as well? Through consideration of the role psychoanalysis is playing in French psychiatry , this paper will try to review this particularity and its interactions with the organisation and values of psychiatry in France , both in the public services and in private practice.
