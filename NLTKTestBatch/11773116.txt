 Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous chronic<disease> disease<disease> of unknown etiology with a wide range of clinical presentations. Diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients with ocular manifestations can be challenging. We first describe a case of sarcoidosis presented with pulmonary involvement and both uveitis and internuclear ophthalmoplegia<symptom> as ocular manifestations. A 55-year-old caucasian woman with non-productive cough<symptom> and weakness<symptom> presented with bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis. Few days later , the patient presented again complaining of horizontal diplopia<symptom> due to internuclear ophthalmoplegia<symptom>. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made as a result of clinical examination and systemic investigations. Particularly , high-resolution computed tomography scanning of the chest was able to identify bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom> not previously detected by chest X-ray. Biopsy confirmed diagnosis showing classic non-caseating granulomas<disease>.
