 CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A 63-year-old man with HIV<pathogen> presented with 1 month of dyspnoea and productive cough<symptom> without orthopnoea. He was afebrile with normal blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , borderline tachycardia<symptom> and mild<symptom> pulmonary wheezing. He had exertional hypoxia requiring 4 L per minute of oxygen. No murmurs , jugular venous distention<symptom> or lower extremity oedema was noted. Clinical evaluation included transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE) , which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal size and systolic function. The right ventricle was normal. There was mild aortic insufficiency; other valves were normal. An abnormality was incidentally seen at the aortic root.The patient was treated for bronchitis<symptom> and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<disease> exacerbation , while further evaluation of the incidental aortic root finding was performed with transoesophageal echocardiography ( TEE) and cardiac MRI ( CMR). What is the most likely diagnosis for this finding?Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.Chronic aortic dissection.Left ventricular outflow tract ( LVOT) pseudoaneurysm.Right coronary artery aneurysm.Aortic root abscess<symptom>.
