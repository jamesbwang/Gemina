 Lower gastrointestinal ( GI) bleeding is a common clinical problem in young patients. The management of this disease<disease> in patients is challenging. The aim of this study is to compare sigmoidoscopy with full colonoscopy in these patients. In this cross-sectional study , 120 eligible patients under 50 years old with acute<symptom> rectal bleeding were enrolled. After cleaning the colon , initially the patients underwent sigmoidoscopy. Pain , the comfort of the test by physician and patient , duration of the procedure , and pathologic findings were recorded. The procedure continued until the splenic flexure passed in the ileocecal valve , and this stage was considered as proximal colonoscopy. Pain , easy performance by physician and the patient , duration of procedure , and pathologic findings were recorded in this stage too. The variables in the two stages were compared with each other. There were 66 women ( 55 %) and 54 men ( 45 %) and the mean of age was 41 Â± 7.9 years. Proximal colonoscopy from splenic flexure to reach cecum was relatively easier for the physician and the patient than sigmoidoscopy ( It is advised to perform full colonoscopy than sigmoidoscopy in young patients with lower GI bleeding<symptom>.
