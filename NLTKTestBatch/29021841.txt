 This study aimed to evaluate the atrial substrate in the left atrium ( LA) by low-voltage areas ( LVAs) and high-dominant frequencies ( DFs) after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI) in nonparoxysmal atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). In 70 patients with nonparoxysmal AF patients ( 41 persistent AF) , LA voltage maps were created during sinus rhythm by external cardioversion after PVI and DF mapping. The patients were divided into AF-free and AF-recurrent groups. The AF freedom rate without antiarrhythmic drugs was 69.0 % after PVI after 1 procedure during a 12-month follow-up. There was a significant difference in the LVA ( < 0.5 mV)/ LA surface area after PVI between the AF-free and AF-recurrent groups ( 15 % vs 23 % , LVAs were associated with AF recurrences after PVI in nonparoxysmal AF patients and overlapped with many high-DF sites. PVI alone may be enough to treat patients with mild-to-moderate extent ( â‰¤ 24 %) of LVAs.
