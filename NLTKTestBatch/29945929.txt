 Permanent cardiac pacemakers require invasive procedures with complications often related to long pacemaker leads. We are developing a percutaneous pacemaker for implantation of an entire pacing system into the pericardial space. Percutaneous micropacemaker implantations were performed in 6 pigs ( 27.4-34.1 kg) using subxyphoid access to the pericardial space. Modifications in the implantation methods and hardware were made after each experiment as the insertion method was optimized. In the first 5 animals , nonfunctional pacemaker devices were studied. In the final animal , a functional pacemaker was implanted. Successful placement of the entire nonfunctional pacing system into the pericardial space was demonstrated in 2 of the first 5 animals , and successful implantation and capture was achieved using a functional system in the last animal. A sheath was developed that allows retractable features to secure positioning within the pericardial space. In addition , a miniaturized camera with fiberoptic illumination allowed visualization of the implantation site before electrode insertion into myocardium. All animals studied during follow-up survived without symptoms<symptom> after the initial postoperative period. A novel micropacemaker system allows cardiac pacing without entering the vascular space or surgical exposure of the heart. This pericardial pacemaker system may be an option for a large number of patients currently requiring transvenous pacemakers but is particularly relevant for patients with restricted vascular access , young children , or those with congenital heart disease<disease> who require epicardial access.
