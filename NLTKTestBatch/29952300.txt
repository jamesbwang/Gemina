 Calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP) is a vasodilatory neuropeptide that plays an important role in the blood vessels of heart and peripheral circulation , a lack of which may cause vasculopathies. In this study , the clinical course of disease<disease> , as well as the efficacy , side effects , and patient satisfaction of systemic calcitonin therapy in patients with systemic sclerosis ( SSc) , was evaluated. Forty-nine patients received repetitive intravenous calcitonin infusions as first-line treatment. The average number of cycles was 12.2 Â± 10.3 over a period of 30 months ( each cycle: 100 U/day over 10 days). Clinical examinations , laboratory tests , and organ imaging were performed before the start of , and at regular intervals during therapy in order to evaluate organ manifestations and the clinical course of the disease<disease>. In addition , patients ' own experiences of the therapy , side effects , and therapy success were evaluated with standardized questionnaires. Over the course of the treatment , seven patients experienced improvements in their condition with a considerable reduction in digital ulceration and improved movement ( 14.3 %). Pulmonary function in seven patients improved during the therapy ( 14.3 %). With regards to side effects , nausea<symptom> ( 41.7 %) , headaches<symptom> ( 33.3 %) , fluctuations<symptom> in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( 29.2 %) , and flushing ( 29.2 %) were observed. Overall , 45.8 % of patients evaluated the therapy as good and 58.3 % would undergo further courses of therapy with calcitonin. Systemic calcitonin treatment seems to have positive clinical effects on SSc and contributes to relieving symptoms<symptom> , especially in patients with cutaneous manifestations. No severe side effects were reported during this study.
