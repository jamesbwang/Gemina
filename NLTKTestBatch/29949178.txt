 To explore the therapeutic effect of Bifidobacterium<pathogen> combined with early enteral nutrition in severe acute pancreatitis<disease>. A total of 60 patients with severe acute pancreatitis<disease> admitted from November 2012 to November 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the different treatment methods , the patients were divided into Bifidobacterium<pathogen> combined with early enteral nutrition group ( experiment group) and early enteral nutrition group ( control group). Serum ALB ( albumin) , CRP ( C-reactive protein) , WBC ( white blood cell count) and PCT ( procalcitonin) levels in both groups were observed. The pain relief time , diet recovery time , length of stay , and hospitalization costs between the two groups , were compared. The APACHE ( acute physiology and chronic health evaluation scoring system) II score and SOFA ( sequential organ<symptom> failure<symptom> assessment) score before and after nutritional support were compared between the two groups. Adverse events and complications were observed as well. 58 patients recovered and 2 died after treatment. Improvements in laboratory indicators such as ALB , CRP , WBC and PCT were much better in the experiment group than the control group ( p < 0.05). Both the length of days and hospitalization cost were lower in the experiment group than those of the control group ( p = 0.0029 , p = 0.0435). In the comparison of hospitalization symptoms<symptom> , shorter pain relief time and diet recovery time were found in the experiment group than those in the control group ( p = 0.0003 , p = 0.0218). After the treatment , APACHE II score and SOFA score of the experiment group were also higher than the control group. No significant differences in adverse events and complications between the two groups were exerted ( p > 0.05). Bifidobacterium<pathogen> combined with early enteral nutrition can improve the nutritional status<symptom> of patients with severe acute pancreatitis<disease> in the acute stage , which also enhances the patient 's immune capacity and the body 's resistance to disease<disease>.
