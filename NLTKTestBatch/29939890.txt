 In this paper we review the history of antidepressant ( AD) development , since the discovery of imipramine in 1957 to the present day. Through this exploration we will show that the increasing placebo response is likely a red herring and that a higher magnitude of placebo response is not an adequate explanation for AD trials ' high failure rates. As a better explanation for their lack of success , we will examine some of the fundamental flaws of AD clinical trials and their origins in historical forces. We focus on underpowering , which occurs as a consequence of unrealistic expectations for AD performance. In addition , we describe the lack of precision in the depression<symptom> outcome measurements for the past 40 years and show how these measures contrast with those used in clinical trials of other chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , which use simpler outcome measures. Finally , we describe the role of regulatory agencies in influencing clinical trial design and how the assumption that ` one size fits all ' for the past 60 years has led to flawed design of AD clinical trials.
