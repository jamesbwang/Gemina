 Surgical resection continues to function as the primary treatment option for most solid tumors. However , the detection of cancerous tissue remains predominantly subjective and reliant on the expertise of the surgeon. Surgery that is guided by fluorescence imaging has shown clinical relevance as a new approach to detecting the primary tumor , tumor margins , and metastatic lymph nodes. It is a technique to reduce recurrence and increase the possibility of a curative resection. While significant progress has been made in developing this emerging technology as a tool to assist the surgeon , further improvements are still necessary. Refining imaging agents and tumor targeting strategies to be a precise and reliable surgical strategy is essential in order to translate this technology into patient care settings. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive update on the most recent progress of fluorescence-guided surgery and its translation into the clinic. By highlighting the current status<symptom> and recent developments of fluorescence image-guided surgery in the field of surgical oncology , we aim to offer insight into the challenges and opportunities that require further investigation.
