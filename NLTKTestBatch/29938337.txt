 Optic neuritis ( ON) is a common clinical manifestation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG) antibody-associated disease<disease>. Other clinical manifestations include acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis<pathogen><disease> , transverse myelitis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Uncommon presentations of MOG-positive disease<disease> have recently been reported. ON in MOG-positive disease<disease> commonly involves the anterior portion of both optic nerves<symptom> , leading to bilateral disc swelling. During the early stages of ON , in the setting of bilateral disc swelling and pain , patients may initially be suspected as pseudotumor cerebri ( PTC). In this study , we report five cases presenting early in the course of MOG-IgG-related ON , which were misdiagnosed as PTC in the emergency department. MOG-IgG-positive ON requires timely treatment to prevent RNFL and vision loss<symptom> secondary to the high relapse rate associated with these antibodies. Our aim is to increase the awareness of the unique findings of MOG-IgG-positive ON , which may initially mimic PTC , thereby delaying treatment.
