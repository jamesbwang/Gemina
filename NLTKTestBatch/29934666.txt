 The purpose of this study is to determine the association of dipstick-determined trace proteinuria<symptom> with metabolic syndrome<symptom> ( MetS) and its components in each age , gender , and eGFR category among a large general population. A total of 270,190 people ( 102,223 men and 167,967 women) aged 40-74 years were included. Subjects were categorized as having negative , trace , and positive proteinuria<symptom> by the dipstick method. The prevalence of MetS increased with increasing levels of proteinuria<symptom> in any estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) category ( odds ratios for MetS relative to negative proteinuria<symptom>: 1.22 , 1.23 , and 1.25 for trace proteinuria<symptom> , and 2.19 , 1.81 , and 1.80 for positive proteinuria<symptom> among subjects with eGFR of â‰¥ 90 , 60-89 , and 45-59 ml/min/1 .73 m Subjects with dipstick-determined trace proteinuria<symptom> showed intermediate risk of having MetS , hypertension , and diabetes between negative and positive proteinuria<symptom> in any eGFR category in a large general population. Thus , MetS components should be checked for subjects with trace proteinuria<symptom> even in those with normal eGFR for the early prevention of cardiovascular diseases<disease>.
