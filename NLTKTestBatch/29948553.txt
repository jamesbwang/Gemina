 Mice lacking the substance P ( SP) neurokinin-1 ( NK1) receptor ( NK1R-/- mice) were used to investigate whether SP affects serotonin ( 5-HT) function in the brain and to assess the effects of acute immobilisation stress on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical ( HPA) axis and 5-HT turnover in individual brain nuclei. Basal HPA activity and the expression of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH) in wild-type ( WT)- and NK1R-/- mice were identical. Stress-induced increases in plasma ACTH concentration were considerably higher in NK1R-/- mice than in WT mice while corticosterone concentrations were equally elevated in both mouse lines. Acute stress did not alter the expression of CRH. In the dorsal raphe nucleus ( DRN) , basal 5-HT turnover was increased in NK1R-/- mice and a 15 min stress further magnified 5-HT utilisation in this region. In the frontoparietal cortex , medial prefrontal cortex , central nucleus of amygdala , and the hippocampal CA1 region , stress increased 5-HT and/or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5-HIAA) concentrations to a similar extent in WT and NK1R-/- mice. 5-HT turnover in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus was not affected by stress , but stress induced similar increases in 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei in WT and NK1R-/- mice. Our findings indicate that NK1 receptor activation suppresses ACTH release during acute stress but does not exert sustained inhibition of the HPA axis. Genetic deletion of the NK1 receptor accelerates 5-HT turnover in DRN under basal and stress conditions. No differences between the responses of serotonergic system to acute stress in WT and NK1R-/- mice occur in forebrain nuclei linked to the regulation of anxiety<symptom> and neuroendocrine stress responses.
