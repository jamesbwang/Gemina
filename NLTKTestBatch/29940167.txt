 To assess the retinal anatomy and array position in Argus II retinal prosthesis recipients. Prospective , noncomparative cohort study. Setting: International multicenter study. Argus II recipients enrolled in the Post-Market Surveillance Studies. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images collected for the Surveillance Studies ( NCT01860092 and NCT01490827) were reviewed. Baseline and postoperative macular thickness , electrode-retina distance ( gap) , optic disc-array overlap , and preretinal membrane presence were recorded at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months. Axial retinal thickness and axial gap along the array 's long axis ( a line between the tack and handle); maximal retinal thickness and maximal gap along a B-scan near the tack , midline , and handle. Thirty-three patients from 16 surgical<disease> sites in the United States and Germany were included. Mean axial retinal thickness increased from month 1 through month 12 at each location , but reached statistical significance only at the array midline ( P = .007). The rate of maximal thickness increase was highest near the array midline ( slope = 6.02 , P = .004) , compared to the tack ( slope = 3.60 , P < .001) or the handle ( slope = 1.93 , P = .368). The mean axial and maximal gaps decreased over the study period , and the mean maximal gap size decrease was significant at midline ( P = .032). Optic disc-array overlap was seen in the minority of patients. Preretinal membranes<symptom> were common before and after implantation. Progressive macular thickening under the array was common and corresponded to decreased electrode-retina gap over time. By month 12 , the array was completely apposed to the macula in approximately half of the eyes.
