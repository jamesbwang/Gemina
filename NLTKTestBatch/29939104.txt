 Prolonged paradoxical sleep deprivation ( PSD) and cold stress ( CS) are known to cause sympathoexcitation and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease<disease>. The present study examined the effect of PSD with CS on hemodynamic perturbations by investigating blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and heart rate variability ( BPV and HRV) in conscious rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups ( n = 10 , each): normal sleep ( NS) , PSD of 72 h , and recovery sleep of 7 days after PSD. When compared with NS , PSD increased systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in all three conditions: before CS ( PreCS) , CS , and after CS ( PostCS). The PSD also increased heart rate in both PreCS and PostCS. Furthermore , spectral power changes were observed throughout the experiment. The PSD increased very-low-frequency BPV in PreCS , decreased very-low-frequency HRV in CS , and increased low-frequency BPV in all three conditions. The PSD increased low-frequency HRV in PreCS , increased high-frequency BPV in both CS and PostCS , and also increased high-frequency HRV in both PreCS and CS but decreased that in PostCS. On the other hand , when compared with PSD , recovery sleep has reversed most cardiovascular changes in PSD toward the NS level. However , when compared with NS , spectral powers of very-low-frequency BPV in the recovery phase showed a lower level. These results showed that in the resting condition , PSD might evoke sympathoexcitation with a tendency to increase both very-low-frequency BPV and very-low-frequency HRV , as the intensified myogenic oscillations. However , in the CS condition , PSD evoked the sympathoexcitation yet might attenuate such myogenic oscillations.
