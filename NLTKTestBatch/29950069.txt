 To investigate the toxicity changes of Euphorbiae Ebracteolatae Radix ( EER) before and after vinegar processing , toxic diterpenoids were concentrated with chloroform as extraction solvent from EER. Then the residue was extracted for non-chloroform extract with 95 % ethanol and water after extraction with chloroform. The chloroform extraction of vinegar processed EER was prepared with the same method. The mice received the drug by oral administration. Moisture content in mice feces , duodenum and colon tissue , aquaporin AQP1 , AQP3 , AQP4 protein expression levels were assayed as the indexes to investigate the toxicity variation of chloroform fraction , non-chloroform fraction , as well as intestinal tract<symptom> toxicity before and after vinegar processing of EER. The results showed that the chloroform fraction extracted from EER could significantly increase the moisture content in mice feces , duodenum and colon , and decrease AQP1 protein expression level , increase AQP3 and AQP4 protein expression levels in the colon. The intestinal toxicity of the chloroform extract was significantly higher than that of non-chloroform extract. The moisture content in mice feces , duodenum and colon was significantly decreased , and the AQPs protein expression tended to be normal in the colon after vinegar processing. The results showed that the chloroform fraction extracted from EER could lead to diarrhea<disease> , intestinal<symptom> edema<symptom> , and the intestinal toxicity action was associated with interfering AQPs protein expression and promoting intestinal fluid transport disorder in mice. Vinegar-processing could reduce intestinal toxicity of EER , so vinegar processing was considered to be the scientific processing method of EER.
