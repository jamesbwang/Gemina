 To observe the clinical efficacy of Huazhuo Jiedu formula in treating chronic erosive gastritis<disease> ( CEG) patients with syndrome<symptom> of accumulation of turbidity and toxicity , explore its mechanism by observing the changes in expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF-1α) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) in serum and gastric mucosa<pathogen> tissues after treatment , and provide theoretical basis for the clinical application of Huazhuo Jiedu formula in treating chronic erosive gastritis<disease>. All 70 patient of CEG were randomly divided into control group and treatment group , 35 cases in each group. The patients in control group received Alatan Wuwei Wan , bid , 1 bag/time; while the patients in treatment group were given with Huazhuo Jiedu formula , 1 dose/day. The course of the treatment was 6 months in both groups. The changes in clinical symptoms<symptom> , gastroscopic signs , pathology and the expression levels of HIF-1α , VEGF , and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten ( PTEN) in serum and gastric mucosa<pathogen> tissues were observed in both groups. The results showed that treatment group was better than control group in clinical efficacy , gastroscopic efficacy and pathological effect after treatment (
