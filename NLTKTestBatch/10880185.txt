 Intestinal parasites are a common problem in the world. The greater proportion of infections is associated with poor water , sanitation , and hygiene ( WASH). This study was conducted to assess intestinal parasites , WASH condition , and their association in rural Dembiya , northwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was employed. Two hundred twenty-five children aged 6-59 months were included. Mothers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire , and the living environment was observed using checklists. Kato-Katz technique was used to determine the intensity of parasitic infections. Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom> ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom>) was used as a biological indicator for drinking water quality. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify WASH predictors of parasites on the basis of adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI) and p < 0.05. The prevalence of intestinal parasites was 25.8 % ( 95 % CI = 20.3-32.0 %). Ascaris lumbricoides ( 78 %) , hookworm ( 12 %) , Hymenolepis nana<pathogen> ( 7 %) , Enterobius vermicularis ( 5 %) , Schistosoma mansoni ( 3 %) , Giardia lamblia ( 3 %) , and Trichuris trichiuria ( 2 %) were identified infections. Intestinal parasites were associated with poor child hand washing practice ( AOR = 3.86 , 95 % CI = 1.53 , 9.75) , unprotected water sources ( AOR = 7.79 , 95 % CI = 3.30 , 18.40) , access to water below 20 l/c/d ( AOR = 3.05 , 95 % CI = 1.28 , 7.23) , poor food safety ( AOR = 4.33 , 95 % CI = 1.62 , 11.58) , and poor sanitation ( AOR = 5.01 , 95 % CI = 1.56 , 16.16). A. lumbricoides , hookworm , H. nana<pathogen> , E. vermicularis , S. mansoni , G. lamblia , and T. trichiuria were identified. Child hand washing practice , service level of water supply , water sources , food safety , and sanitation were associated with intestinal parasites. WASH promotion is needed to prevent infections.
