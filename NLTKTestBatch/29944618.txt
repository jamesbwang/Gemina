 Despite waning indications in the general population for preoperative autologous blood donation ( PABD) , it is a procedure that continues to be offered to healthy living liver donors ( LLD). In this study we sought to understand the impact of PABD on the LLD population. We retrospectively reviewed charts of one institution 's LLDs over a 2-year period. Per institutional protocol , all accepted LLD donated 1 unit of autologous blood prior to living donor hepatectomy ( LDH). Sixty-six LLDs underwent PABD and 59 of these donors underwent LDH. In this cohort , there was a significant 1.2 g/dL drop in HB from baseline ( prior to PABD) to the evening before surgery. Mean ( SD) procedure estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 260 mL ( ± 100) , mean ( SD) resected graft weight<symptom> was 592 g ( ± 174). No allogeneic blood was transfused. 42 % of LLD received autologous transfusion. Mean ( SD) pretransfusion HB of transfused LLDs was 11.7 g/dL ( ± 1.2). All LLDs had negative antibody screens. 63 % of donated autologous units were discarded. PABD in our population is associated with decreased preoperative HB , increased exposure of healthy LLD to unnecessary transfusion-related risks , and high rates of discarded blood product. We encourage further investigation and reconsideration of the practice of PABD and autologous transfusion in LLDs.
