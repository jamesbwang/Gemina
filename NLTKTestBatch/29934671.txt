 We report the perioperative outcomes and complications after transition from extracorporeal urinary diversion ( ECUD) to intracorporeal urinary diversion ( ICUD) following robot-assisted radical cystectomy ( RARC). Analysis of data from a prospectively maintained institutional review board-approved database of 180 patients treated with cystectomy at our institution from April 2015 to October 2017 was performed. 127 patients underwent RARC and received an ileal conduit. Only five patients received a neobladder after RARC and were excluded from analysis. 68 patients had extracorporeal and 59 intracorporeal ileal conduit after RARC. There were no significant differences in patient demographics and oncological characteristics between the two groups. Of note , intracorporeal ileal conduit was associated with significantly reduced median total operative times ( 330 vs 375 min , p = 0.019) , reduced median estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 300 vs 425 ml , p < 0.035) and lower 30-day overall complication rates ( 48.4 vs 71.4 % , p = 0.008) when compared to extracorporeal diversion. However , the median length of stay , 30-90-day complication rates , mortality rates and ureteroileal anastomotic stricture rates were similar in both groups. The median operative time for RARC and intracorporeal ileal conduit was significantly shorter in the second cohort of 29 cases compared to the first 30 cases ( 300 vs 360 min , p = 0.004). Other outcomes were similar in both cohorts. In our experience , transition from extracorporeal to intracorporeal diversion after RARC is safe , technically feasible and benefits from shorter operative times , reduced estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , and lower 30-day overall complication rates.
