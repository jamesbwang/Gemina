 Acculturation markers , such as language use , have been associated with Latino depression<symptom>. Language use may change between generations; however , few studies have collected intergenerational data to assess how language differences between generations impact depression<symptom>. Using the Niños Lifestyle and Diabetes Study ( 2013-2014) , we assessed how changes in Spanish language use across two generations of Mexican-origin participants in Sacramento , California , influenced offspring depressive symptoms<symptom> ( N = 603). High depressive symptoms<symptom> were defined as CESD-10 scores ≥ 10. We used log-binomial and linear-binomial models to calculate prevalence ratios and differences , respectively , for depressive symptoms<symptom> by language use , adjusting for identified confounders and within-family clustering. Decreased Spanish use and stable-equal English/Spanish use across generations protected against depressive symptoms<symptom> , compared to stable-high Spanish use. Stable-low Spanish use was not associated with fewer depressive symptoms<symptom> compared to stable-high Spanish use. Exposure to multiple languages cross-generationally may improve resource access and social networks that protect against depression<symptom>.
