 Head<disease> and neck sarcomas<disease> are rare and consist of a variety of histologic subtypes. We present a case of undifferentiated/unclassified sarcoma<disease> ( UUS) of the maxillary sinus , a tumor subtype historically known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( MFH) or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma<disease> ( UPS). A 50-year-old female patient presented with worsening facial<symptom> pain<symptom> and dysphagia<symptom>. Physical examination demonstrated a large , ulcerated mass protruding from the oral cavity. Computed tomography demonstrated a large , enhancing mass centered in the right maxillary sinus with local invasion. The initial biopsy was read as `` central giant cell granuloma<disease>. '' Conservative management yielded no improvement , and the tumor grew steadily. The patient underwent a total maxillectomy with resection of the orbital floor and an anterior ethmoidectomy , followed by radiation and chemotherapy. In addition to treatment of this patient , we discuss a review of the literature and the clinical presentation , radiologic , and histologic findings of this disease<disease>.
