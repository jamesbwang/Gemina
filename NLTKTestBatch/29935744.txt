 The Fear of Cancer Recurrence ( FCR) is reported to be a normal response to cancer , but little is known about the interaction between FCR and maladaptive cognitive processes , which may increase the risk for depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> disorders among cancer survivors. Previous studies have shown the influence of rumination on depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> in other populations. Thus , the present study aimed to examine how FCR and rumination may relate to depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> among cancer survivors. The present study included cancer survivors ( N = 388) who had completed their active treatment at the National University Cancer Institute Singapore , and achieved complete remission from cancer. All participants completed self-report measures of FCR ( Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory) , rumination ( Rumination Response Scale) , depression<symptom> , and anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> ( Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale). The present study observed that ( 1) FCR and rumination were associated with more severe<symptom> depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , and ( 2) the interaction between FCR and rumination was associated with more severe depressive symptoms<symptom> ( p = .01). Specifically , rumination was significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms<symptom> in individuals with high FCR ( p < .001) , while rumination was not associated with depressive symptoms<symptom> in individuals with low FCR ( p > .05). Habitual rumination may be a maladaptive cognitive style to cope with high FCR. Therefore , the present study 's findings elucidate the moderating effect of rumination on FCR , and such findings may better inform psychological interventions to reduce the risk of depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> among cancer survivors who experience high FCR.
