 Meta-analyses conventionally weight<symptom> study estimates on the inverse of their error variance , in order to maximize precision. Unbiased variability in the estimates of these study-level error variances increases with the inverse of study-level replication. Here , we demonstrate how this variability accumulates asymmetrically across studies in precision-weighted meta-analysis , to cause undervaluation of the meta-level effect size or its error variance ( the meta-effect and meta-variance). Small samples , typical of the ecological literature , induce big sampling errors in variance estimation , which substantially bias precision-weighted meta-analysis. Simulations revealed that biases differed little between random- and fixed-effects tests. Meta-estimation of a one-sample mean from 20 studies , with sample sizes of 3-20 observations , undervalued the meta-variance by
