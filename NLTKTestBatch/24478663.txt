 The world population is aging and the prevalence of dementia is increasing. By 2050 , those aged 60 years and older are expected to make up a quarter of the population. With that , the number of people with dementia is increasing. Unfortunately , there is no cure for dementia. The progression of symptoms<symptom> with no hope of improvement is difficult to cope with , both for patients and their caregivers. New and evidence-based strategies are needed to support the well-being of both caregiver and patient. Mindfulness training is a body-mind intervention that has shown to improve psychological well-being in a variety of mental health conditions. Mindfulness , a non-judgmental attention to one 's experience in the present moment , is a skill that can be developed with a standard 8-week training. Research has shown preliminary but promising results for mindfulness-based interventions to benefit people with dementia and caregivers. The aim of this review is ( a) to provide a rationale for the application of mindfulness in the context of dementia care by giving an overview of studies on mindfulness for people with dementia and/or their caregivers and ( b) to provide suggestions for future projects on mindfulness in the context of dementia and to give recommendations for future research.
