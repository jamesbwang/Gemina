 Left atrial appendage occlusion ( LAAO) is a technique for preventing thromboembolism in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and a high risk of irreversible bleeding. In some patients , a spontaneous iatrogenic transseptal leak ( ITL) remains after LAAO. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between ITL incidence and the results of cardiac function tests in patients who underwent LAAO. LAOO was performed in 62 consecutive patients using the Amplatzer Amulet. Before and 3 months after LAA occlusion , the 6-min walking distance ( 6MWD) test was performed in all patients and oxygen consumption assessment ( VO The presence of transseptal leaks after LAAO does not influence overall cardiac function test results. However , in patients with HF , there is an increase in oxygen consumption and 6MWD. These results indicate that ITLs in patients with HF decrease left atrial pressure , which is the key contributor to the symptoms<symptom> of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> during physical activity.
