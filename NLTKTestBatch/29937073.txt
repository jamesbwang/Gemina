 Intra-abdominal hypertension is classified as either primary or secondary- primary occurs due to intra-abdominal or retro-peritoneal pathophysiology , whereas secondary results in alterations in capillary fluid dynamics due to factors , such as massive fluid resuscitation and generalised inflammation<symptom>. The renal and gastro-intestinal effects occur early in the progression of intra-abdominal hypertension , and may lead to poor patient outcomes if not identified. As a direct response to intra-abdominal hypertension , renal function is reduced with remarkable impairment from pressures<symptom> of around 10 mmHg , oliguria developing at 15 mmHg and anuria developing at 30 mmHg. Intestinal micro-circulation is significantly reduced by up to 50 % with intra-abdominal pressures<symptom> as low as 15 mmHg. Mucosal and submucosal tissue hypo-perfusion causes considerable damage to the intestinal cells , potentially resulting in bacterial translocation , endotoxin release , sepsis<disease> and multiple<symptom> organ<symptom> failure<symptom>. The critical care nurse plays an important role in the early identification of intra-abdominal hypertension however , without this essential knowledge base and comprehension of intra-abdominal hypertension , clinical signs and symptoms<symptom> may go unnoticed or be misinterpreted as signs of other critical illnesses.
