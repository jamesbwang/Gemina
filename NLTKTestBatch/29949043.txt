 Sclerotherapy is a common technique for the removal of intradermal veins. This study examined the rationale for prescribing micronized purified flavonoid fraction ( MPFF) in clinical , etiological , anatomic , pathophysiologic ( CEAP) class C1 patients with dilated intradermal veins scheduled for sclerotherapy. In a national , multicenter , observational program , physicians recruited CEAP C1s patients scheduled for sclerotherapy. The decision to prescribe adjuvant MPFF ( 1000 mg/day for 6 weeks beginning 2 weeks before sclerotherapy) was made according to usual practice. Disease<disease> severity and treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks post-sclerotherapy using a visual analog scale ( VAS) as well as quality-of-life ( CIVIQ-14) and patient satisfaction ( Darvall) questionnaires. A total of 70 physicians recruited 1150 patients: 1071 ( 93 %) women , 79 ( 7 %) men. Mean age ( ± SD) was 40.7 ± 10.7 years ( range 18-74) and mean body mass index was 23.6 ± 3.3 kg/m Resolution of venous symptoms<symptom> post-sclerotherapy was greater in patients treated with MPFF compared with those undergoing sclerotherapy alone , supporting the rationale for use of MPFF in patients undergoing sclerotherapy.
