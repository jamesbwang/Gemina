 Multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs) and heavy metals could be absorbed and bioaccumulated by agricultural crops , implicating ecological risks. Herein , the present study investigated the ecotoxicological effects and mechanisms of individual carboxylated MWCNTs ( MWCNTs-COOH) ( 2.5 , 5.0 and 10 mg/L) and their combination with 20 µM Pb and 5 µM Cd ( shortened as Pb + Cd) on roots of Vicia faba L. seedlings after 20 days of exposure. The results showed that the tested MWCNTs-COOH induced imbalance of nutrient elements , enhanced isozymes and activities of superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , guaiacol peroxidase ( POD) , catalase ( CAT) , and ascorbate peroxidase ( APX) , resulting in accumulation of carbonylated proteins , elevation of endoproteases ( EPs) isozymes , and reduction of HSP70 synthesis in the roots. However , the tested MWCNTs-COOH facilitated the enrichment of Cd , Pb and Na elements , contributing to the decrease of SOD , CAT and APX activities , and the reduction of HSP70 synthesis , whereas the elevation of carbonylated proteins , EP activities and cell necrosis<symptom> in the roots when Pb + Cd was combined in comparison to the treatments of MWCNTs-COOH , or Pb + Cd alone. Thus , the tested MWCNTs-COOH not only caused oxidative stress , but also aggravated the oxidative damage in the roots exposed to Pb + Cd in the culture solution.
