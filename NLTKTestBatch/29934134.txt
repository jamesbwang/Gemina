 CD25 knock-out ( CD25KO) mice spontaneously develop Sjögren Syndrome<symptom> ( SS)- like inflammation<symptom>. We investigated the role of commensal bacteria<pathogen> by comparing CD25KO mice housed in conventional or germ-free conditions. Germ-free CD25KO mice have greater corneal barrier dysfunction , lower goblet cell density , increased total lymphocytic infiltration score , increased expression of IFN-γ , IL-12 and higher a frequency of CD4
