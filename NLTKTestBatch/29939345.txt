 Sexual assault is a frequent interpersonal trauma , which often leads to posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD). Among other postassault characteristics , self-blame attributions were suggested to play an important role in sexually assaulted individuals ' coping , and were consistently associated with PTSD in this population. The present study aimed to elucidate the neural underpinnings that may associate self-blame and PTSD in women who experienced sexual assault at adulthood , using structural and resting-state functional MRI. Thirty-eight sexually assaulted women and 24 non-exposed matched controls were studied ( mean age: 25 years). Among the sexually assaulted participants , assault-related self-blame was negatively correlated with gray matter volume ( GMV) bilaterally in the lingual gyrus and adjacent intracalcarine cortex. GMV in this cluster was also predicted by intrusion symptoms<symptom> and negative social reactions. Resting-state functional connectivity ( rs-FC) of this cluster with the left anterior temporal fusiform cortex significantly differed between PTSD and non-PTSD sexually assaulted participants , and was inversely correlated with intrusion symptoms<symptom> and with peritraumatic dissociation. Finally , lingual cluster 's GMV and rs-FC with the anterior fusiform mediated the association between self-blame and intrusion symptoms<symptom> across sexually assaulted participants. These findings link assault-related self-blame , disrupted postassault recovery and the neural circuitry involved in the processing of traumatic memories.
