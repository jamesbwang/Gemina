 Pathogenic microbes routinely keep encountering different types of stress in their environment such as high osmolarity , high temperature , pH fluctuations<symptom> in host gut etc.. They tend to acquire certain small molecular weight molecules , termed osmolytes , so as to handle these challenges and survive despite them. These organic osmolytes even at higher concentrations are quite compatible with most of their ongoing intracellular processes. These osmolytes include some which are self-synthesized by the microorganisms , while majority of them are imbibed from the external environment via osmolyte transporters. In this review , we aim to discuss work done on osmolytes and their transport systems , and their influence upon sustenance and virulence of the pathogens under the given stressed conditions. Most interestingly , a detailed study of bacterial stress responses could prove to be useful in comprehending what these pathogens face in the host microenvironment , manipulating the pathogen survival in human gut , and hence have an intervention in addressing the menace of pathogenic resistance in humans as well as animals.
