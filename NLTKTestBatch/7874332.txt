 The clinical impact of a decrease in impedance during radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA) has not been fully clarified. The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of impedance decrease and to determine its optimal cutoff value during RFCA. We evaluated 34 consecutive patients ( total 3264 lesions<symptom> , mean age 66 ± 8.7 years , 10 females) who underwent their first ablation for atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). The impedance decrease , average contact force ( CF) , application time , force-time integral ( FTI) , product of impedance decrease and application time ( PIT) , and the product of impedance decrease and FTI ( PIFT) were measured for all lesions<symptom>. Levels of cardiac troponin I ( TrpI) were measured for assessment of myocardial injury. The incidence of intraprocedural pulmonary vein-left atrium reconnection or dormant conduction ( reconnection) was determined. The relationships between the ablation parameters and the increase in TrpI ( ΔTrpI) were evaluated. The predictive value of the parameters for reconnection was assessed using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis. Reconnection was detected in 18 patients. Average FTI and PIT were significantly correlated with ΔTrpI ( FTI: The combination of CF and a decrease in impedance could be important in the evaluation of myocardial lesions<symptom> and reconnection during RFCA.
