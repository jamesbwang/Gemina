 In 2013 five polar explorers attempted to complete the first Trans-Antarctic Winter Traverse ( TAWT). This study presents the ophthalmological findings for this group , who overwintered in Antarctica as part of the White<symptom> Mars Human Science Protocol. Antarctic crews are exposed to extreme cold , chronic hypoxia and altered day-night cycles. Previous studies of Antarctic explorers have focused on the prolonged effect of ultraviolet radiation including the development of ultraviolet keratitis<disease><symptom> and accelerated cataract formation. This is the first study of its kind to investigate the effect of overwintering in Antarctica on the human eye. Pre and post-expedition clinical observations were made including visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , colour vision , auto-refraction , subjective refraction , retinal examination , retinal autofluoresence and retinal thickness , which were graded for comparison. During the expedition additional observations were made on a monthly basis including LogMAR visual acuity , autorefraction and intraocular pressure. No significant differences between pre and post-expedition observations were found , including visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , colour vision , refraction , visual fields , intraocular pressure and retinal examination. There was a small but statistically significant decrease in retinal thickness across all regions of the retina , except for the macular and fovea , in all explorers. Intra-expedition observations remained within normal limits. Reassuringly , the human eye remains largely unchanged by exposure to the extreme conditions encountered during the Antarctic winter , however , further research is needed to investigate changes in retinal thickness. This may have implications for scientists who spend prolonged periods of time in the polar regions , as well as those who have prolonged exposure to the extreme cold or chronic hypoxia in other settings.
