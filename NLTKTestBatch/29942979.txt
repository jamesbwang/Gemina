 Following our previous cross-sectional analysis , indicating age-related improvements of response inhibition in a random-motor-generation task ( MPT) in adolescents with Asperger syndrome<symptom> ( AS) , the present study reports data from a 2.5-year follow-up examination in the original sample. We found more marked improvements within the follow-up interval in younger AS children , while older AS boys as well as typically developing ( TD) boys remained at a relatively constant level throughout. The current longitudinal study further substantiates the notion that AS children ( on average) catch up with TD children when they grow older as regards the basic inhibition of developing routine response patterns.
