 Triacylglycerol ( TAG) from photosynthetic microalgae is a sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Physiological stress triggers microalgal TAG accumulation. However excessive physiological stress will impair the photosynthesis system seriously thus decreasing TAG productivity because of the low biomass production. Hence , it is critical to quantitatively and timely monitor the degree of the stress while the microalgal cells growing so that the optimal TAG productivity can be obtained. The lack of an on-line monitored indicator has limited our ability to gain knowledge of cellular `` health status<symptom> '' information regarding high TAG productivity. Therefore , to monitor the degree of nitrogen stress of the cells , we investigated the correlation between the photosynthetic system II ( PS II) quantum yield and the degree of stress based on the high relevancy between photosynthetic reduction and nitrogen stress-induced TAG accumulation in microalgal cells. Δ The results indicate that the semi-continuous cultivation process with a controlled degree of stress by monitoring the Δ
