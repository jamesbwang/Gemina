 In N = 400 women ( 46.9 ± 15.5 years) , the prevalence of severe ( < 25 nmol/l) and mild ( ≥ 25 and < 50 nmol/l) 25 ( OH) D deficiency was 7 and 32.2 % , respectively , while 60.8 % women had adequate status<symptom>. Serum iPTH increased ( > 37.0 pg/ml) when 25 ( OH) D was < 46.9 nmol/l. BMD was not significantly lower in the participants with iPTH > 37.0 pg/ml. Bone mineral density ( BMD) is affected by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D) and intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH). Our objective was to analyze the association between serum 25 ( OH) D and iPTH and their mutual regulatory influence on BMD in women with 25 ( OH) D deficiency. We also attempted to establish a threshold for the serum 25 ( OH) D below which serum iPTH increases. The participants were 400 generally healthy women ( 46.9 ± 15.5 years) recruited from local communities. BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry , and serum 25 ( OH) D , iPTH , calcium , phosphorus , alkaline phosphatase , osteocalcin , and C-telopeptide ( CTX) were analyzed from the fasting blood samples. Multivariate regression models were used to investigate the relationships among serum 25 ( OH) D , iPTH , and BMD. Serum iPTH increased when 25 ( OH) D concentrations were below 46.9 nmol/l. Severe 25 ( OH) D deficiency ( < 25 nmol/l) was found in 7 % of the participants and was associated with significantly higher iPTH compared to participants with serum 25 ( OH) D ≥ 25 nmol/l. BMD was negatively associated with iPTH only in the group with severe 25 ( OH) D deficiency. However , BMD was not significantly lower in the participants with severe 25 ( OH) D deficiency compared to those with mild deficiency or with adequate status<symptom>. Our results showed that threshold level of 25 ( OH) D below which iPTH started to rise was 46.9 nmol/l. There was no negative impact of iPTH on BMD or bone turnover markers in women with severe 25 ( OH) D deficiency. This might be due to the relatively young age of our participants in whom the unfavorable effect of 25 ( OH) D deficiency on bone might have not yet appeared.
