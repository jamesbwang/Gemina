 ( Purpose) To investigate the prevalence of neck and shoulder symptoms<symptom> during the use of tablet computer , and to identify the risk factors associated with these symptoms<symptom>. ( Subjects and Methods) A cross-sectional survey was conducted to study tablet computer usage , posture<symptom> during use , and neck and shoulder symptoms<symptom> in 412 participants in a school setting. Significant risk factors for musculoskeletal symptoms<symptom> during tablet computer use were identified. ( Results) Overall prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms<symptom> during tablet computer use was 67.9 % with greater prevalence of neck symptoms<symptom> ( neck: 84.6 %; shoulder/upper extremity: 65.4 %). Significant risk factors associated with symptoms<symptom> during use were: current musculoskeletal symptoms<symptom> , gender , roles , and postural factors including: sitting without back support , sitting with device in lap , and lying on the side and on the back during tablet computer use. A multivariate analysis further showed that the odds for females to have symptoms<symptom> were 2.059 times higher than males. ( Conclusion) The findings revealed that female gender and other postural factors were significantly associated with musculoskeletal symptoms<symptom> during the use of tablet computer. Among all postural factors , sitting without back support was identified as the most important risk factor for having musculoskeletal symptoms<symptom>.
