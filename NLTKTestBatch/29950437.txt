 Cross-sectional studies have shown that spinal<disease> cord volume ( SCV) loss is related to disease<disease> severity in multiple sclerosis ( MS). However , long-term data are lacking. Our aim was to evaluate SCV loss as a biomarker of disease<disease> progression in comparison to other MRI measurements in a large cohort of patients with relapse-onset MS with 6-year follow-up. The upper cervical SCV , the total brain volume , and the brain T2 lesion<symptom> volume were measured annually in 231 patients with MS ( 180 relapsing-remitting ( RRMS) and 51 secondary progressive ( SPMS)) over 6 years on 3-dimensional , T1-weighted , magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo images. Expanded Disability Status<symptom> Scale ( EDSS) score and relapses were recorded at every follow-up. Patients with SPMS had lower baseline SCV ( SCV loss over time relates to the number of clinical relapses in RRMS , but overall does not differ between RRMS and SPMS. SCV proved to be a strong predictor of physical disability and disease<disease> progression , indicating that SCV may be a suitable marker for monitoring disease<disease> activity and severity.
