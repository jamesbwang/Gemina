 Isolated avulsion fracture of the peroneus longus tendon insertion at the base of the first metatarsal without injury of the tarsometatarsal joint is very rare. Similar to most avulsion fractures , this type of injury is caused by strong tension exerted by the peroneus longus tendon. The mechanism leading to this lesion<symptom> and treatment options are not clearly defined. Several surgical techniques have been advocated for this fracture , including excision of an avulsion fragment and open reduction for internal fixation through the medial aspect of the foot or minimal plantar incision. We have described a method of percutaneous fixing of the avulsion fracture at the plantar lateral base of the first metatarsal using the ZipTight Fixation System ( Zimmer Biomet Warsaw , Indiana , USA) , which offers the advantage of allowing a rigid fixation and minimal invasive surgical technique for a small fragment.
