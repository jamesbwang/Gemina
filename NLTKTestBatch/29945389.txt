 To observe the efficacy of compound Dendrobium on Sprague Dawley rats ( SD) hypertension model induced by `` dietary disorders '' and its relevant mechanism , totally 50 SD rats were fed with high-sugar , high-fat diet and alcohol for four weeks. According to the blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> after modeling , the rats were divided into model group , valsartan group ( 8 mg · kg ⁻¹) , low , medium and high-dose Dendrobium candidum<pathogen> compound groups ( 1.65 , 3.30 , 5.00 g · kg ⁻¹) , with 10 rats in each group , and the other 10 SD rats were also taken as the normal group. After four weeks of treatment , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was measured. Orbital blood was collected for the determination of serum cholesterol ( TC) , triglycerides ( TG) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-c) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL) , calculation of atherosclerosis index ( AI). Nitric acid reductase method was used to detect serum nitric oxide ( NO); the levels of serum endothelin-1 ( ET-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1) were measured by ELISA. The rats were put to death after the last administration , and the protein expressions of PI3K/AKT/eNOS in thoracic aorta of rats in each group were detected by Western blot. The aorta was separated and stained with hematoxylin-eosin ( HE) to observe the changes in the endothelium and blood vessels in the thoracic aorta. Masson staining was used to observe the formation of aortic collagen. The expressions of nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS) and ICAM-1 in aortic endothelial cells were observed by immunohistochemistry. In contrast , the results show D. candidum<pathogen> compound can significantly reduce the blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in hypertensive rats , increase HDL-c , and reduce AI , while increasing serum NO content , decreasing ET-1 and ICAM-1 levels and promoting PI3K/AKT/NOS protein expressions. The lesion<symptom> degree of the D. candidum<pathogen> compound group was reduced , and the collagen deposition was significantly reduced. Meanwhile , D. candidum<pathogen> compound can significantly increase the expression of eNOS , and reduce the formation of ICAM-1. Therefore , D. candidum<pathogen> compound has an obvious antihypertensive effect on hypertensive rats , which may be related to the increase in PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling pathways and NO generation , the inhibition of the secretion of ICAM-1 and ET-1 , the protection of the vascular endothelium and the improvement of aortic disease<disease>.
