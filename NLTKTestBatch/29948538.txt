 Little information about the development of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> in relation to arsenic exposure duration is available. Therefore , skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> in a cohort from the Bameng region of China were diagnosed in 2012 and 2017. The results indicated that the prevalence of hyperkeratosis , pigmentation and depigmentation in 2017 was 64.67 , 6.67 and 12.67 %. There were 42 and 34 % of male subjects and female subjects suffered from skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> in 2012. Their morbidity rates were 10.43 and 8.98 per 1000 person-years. In 2017 , the values were significantly increased. The prevalence and morbidity rate of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> were positively correlated with age and arsenic levels in drinking water. Males had higher prevalence of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> compared with female. However , the â‰¤ 40 years female group had higher prevalence of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. In addition , the increased rate of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> prevalence was negatively correlated with arsenic levels in drinking water. The odds ratios ( ORs) showed that the risks of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> were positively associated with the proportion of inorganic arsenic ( % iAs) and monomethylarsonic acid ( % MMA) in urine , and negatively correlated with arsenic methylation capacity in both 2012 and 2017. It can be concluded that females immigrated from other areas were more susceptible to developing skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. A certain cumulative arsenic exposure dose , which may be existing , significantly increased the prevalence of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. Longer arsenic exposure duration might elevate the toxicity of iAs to skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> and reduce the positive effects of arsenic methylation capacity on skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>.
