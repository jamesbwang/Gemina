 Acute severe colitis<disease> ( ASC) is conventionally diagnosed by Truelove and Witts ' criteria which are non-specific and can be affected by other pathologic conditions. Fecal calprotectin ( FCP) is a gut-specific marker of inflammation which can predict short-term outcomes in patients with ASC. We aimed to define the role of FCP in the diagnosis of ASC. This prospective observational cohort study included adult patients ( > 18 years) with ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) for whom FCP was measured and was under follow-up from April 2015 to December 2016. Patients were divided into two cohorts: ( 1) all consecutive hospitalized patients with ASC as defined by Truelove and Witts ' criteria; ( 2) outpatients with active UC ( defined by Mayo score) who did not fulfill Truelove and Witts ' criteria. FCP levels were compared between the two cohorts , and a cutoff for FCP to diagnose ASC was determined. Of 97 patients , 49 were diagnosed with ASC ( mean age: 36.1 ± 11.9 years , 36 males) and 48 with active UC ( mean age: 37.9 ± 12.4 years , 25 males). Median FCP levels were significantly higher in patients with ASC ( 1776 ( 952-3123) vs 282 ( 43-568) µg/g , p < 0.001) than mild to moderately active UC ( n = 48) or moderately active UC ( n = 35 , 1776 ( 952-3123) vs 332 ( 106-700) µg/g , p < 0.001). A FCP cutoff of 782 μg/g of stool<symptom> had excellent diagnostic accuracy , with an area under the curve of 0.92 ( 95 % CI 0.87-0.97) , sensitivity of 84 % and specificity of 88 % to differentiate ASC from active UC. FCP could differentiate ASC from mild to moderate patients with UC , but requires validation before clinical use.
