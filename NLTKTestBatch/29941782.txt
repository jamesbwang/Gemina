 To examine the combined association of cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF) , muscular fitness ( MF) , and adherence to a Mediterranean diet ( MeDiet) on cardiovascular risk in adolescents , a pooled study , including cross-sectional data from two projects ( 2477 adolescents ( 1320 girls) aged 12 ‚Åª 18 years) , was completed. A shuttle run test was used to assess CRF. MF was assessed by the standing-long jump and handgrip tests. Adherence to a MeDiet was assessed by the Kidmed questionnaire. A cardiovascular risk score was computed from the following components: Age and sex , waist circumference , triglycerides , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL) , and glucose. Analysis of covariance showed that participants classified as having optimal ( High) adherence to a MeDiet/HighMF/HighCRF , as well those classified as low adherence to a MeDiet/HighMF/HighCRF , had , on average , the lowest cardiovascular risk score ( F = 15.6;
