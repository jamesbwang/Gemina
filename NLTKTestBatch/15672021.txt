 Genetic diseases<disease> can be diagnosed early during pregnancy , but many monogenic disorders continue to cause considerable neonatal and pediatric morbidity and mortality. Early intervention through intrauterine gene editing , however , could correct the genetic defect , potentially allowing for normal organ development , functional disease<disease> improvement , or cure. Here we demonstrate safe intravenous and intra-amniotic administration of polymeric nanoparticles to fetal mouse tissues at selected gestational ages with no effect on survival or postnatal growth. In utero introduction of nanoparticles containing peptide nucleic acids ( PNAs) and donor DNAs corrects a disease-causing mutation in the β-globin gene in a mouse model of human β-thalassemia , yielding sustained postnatal elevation of blood hemoglobin levels into the normal range , reduced reticulocyte counts , reversal of splenomegaly<symptom> , and improved survival , with no detected off-target mutations in partially homologous loci. This work may provide the basis for a safe and versatile method of fetal gene editing for human monogenic disorders.
