 We examined the associations between late preterm ( LPT) birth children aged â‰¥ 5 years and the frequency of bedwetting. Moreover , those who were born full term/low birth weight<symptom> ( BW) , LPT/low BW , LPT/normal BW , and LPT/low BW were compared. In total , we evaluated 614 patients who underwent assessments for frequent bedwetting at the three hospitals from January 2014 to December 2016. Data at the initial visit were collected from the electronic medical records. We assessed the patients ' bladder diaries and questionnaires containing detailed information on demographics and frequency of bedwetting per month. Neonatal data were collected from the Maternal and Child Health Handbook. Frequency of bedwetting in the LPT/low BW group was higher than in the term/low BW group ( 28 vs. 22.5 , p < 0.05). However , the frequency between the LPT/normal BW group and the LPT/low BW group was not significantly different ( 28 vs. 28 , p = 1.00). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to eliminate potential confounding factors , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and intellectual disability , but results were not changed. This study revealed that LPT/low BW was associated with increased frequency of bedwetting in children. The results suggest that gestational age should be considered when examining patients with severe bedwetting. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
