 The best approach for treating common bile duct stones remains a matter of debate. Traditional laparoscopic common bile duct exploration ( LCBDE) can cause adverse events such as stenosis of the bile duct. Moreover , with advances in technology and surgical skills , the use of laparoscopic transcystic common bile duct exploration ( LTCBDE) is gradually rising. To compare the safety , feasibility , and short-term clinical benefits of LTCBDE and LCBDE through matched cases. Web of science , Cochrane , PubMed , and CNKI were searched systematically to identify studies published between January 2007 and December 2017 that compared LTCBDE and LCBDE without a restriction of languages. This meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Twenty-one studies matched the selection criteria , including 1561 cases of LTCBDE and 1500 cases of LCBDE. There was no obvious difference in stone clearance ( OR 1.44 , 95 % CI 0.84-2.47; P = 0.18). However , LTCBDE had a shorter operative time ( MD- 17.72 , 95 % CI- 19.42 to- 16.02; P < 0.00001) and shorter hospital stay ( MD- 2.20 , 95 % CI- 2.32 to- 2.08; P < 0.00001). Besides , the LTCBDE group showed significantly better results for blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( MD- 7.61 , 95 % CI- 8.85 to- 6.37; P < 0.00001) and postoperative complications ( OR 0.28 , 95 % CI 0.19-0.41; P < 0.00001). In addition , LTCBDE was more cost efficient ( MD- 2.51 , 95 % CI- 2.72 to- 2.30; P < 0.00001). Further , we calculated the absolute mean of operative time ( LTCBDE: LCBDE = 97.56:117.81 min) , hospital stay ( LTCBDE: LCBDE = 5.22:8.91 days) , hospital expenses ( LTCBDE: LCBDE = 8646.121:11848.31 RMB) , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( LTCBDE: LCBDE = 29.3:52.0 ml) , the rate of CBD stone clearance ( LTCBDE: LCBDE = 92.8:95.0 %) , and postoperative complications ( LTCBDE: LCBDE = 6.7:14.6 %) in both groups to obtain more convincing results. The stone clearance of LTCBDE was equal to that of LCBDE , and LTCBDE demonstrated a shorter operative time , lower blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , and other advantages. Thus , the surgical procedure of laparoscopic transcystic choledochotomy is feasible and safe.
