 Poor<symptom> survival rates of patients with tumors arising from or disseminating into the brain are attributed to an inability to excise all tumor tissue ( if operable) , a lack of blood-brain barrier ( BBB) penetration of chemotherapies/targeted agents , and an intrinsic tumor radio-/ chemo-resistance. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM) protein orchestrates the cellular DNA damage response ( DDR) to cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation ( IR). ATM genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition results in tumor cell hypersensitivity<disease> to IR. We report the primary pharmacology of the clinical-grade , exquisitely potent ( cell IC
