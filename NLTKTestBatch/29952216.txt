 Models of early , community-based palliative care for individuals with New<pathogen> York Heart Association ( NYHA) class III/IV heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and their families are lacking. We used the Medical Research Council process of developing complex interventions to conduct a formative evaluation study to translate an early palliative care intervention from cancer to heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. One component of the parent formative evaluation pilot study was qualitative satisfaction interviews with 8 patient-caregiver dyad participants who completed Educate , Nurture , Advise , Before Life Ends Comprehensive Heartcare For Patient and Caregivers ( ENABLE CHF-PC) intervention. The ENABLE CHF-PC consists of an in-person palliative care assessment , weekly telehealth coaching sessions , and monthly follow-up. Subsequent to completing the coaching sessions , patient and caregiver participants were interviewed to elicit their experiences with ENABLE CHF-PC. Digitally recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic approach. Patients ( n = 8) mean age was 67.3 , 62.5 % were female , 75 % were married/living with a partner; caregivers ( n = 8) mean age was 56.8 , and 87.5 % were female. Four themes related to experiences with ENABLE CHF-PC included `` allowed me to vent , '' `` gained perspective , '' `` helped me plan , '' and `` gained illness management and decision-making skills. '' Recommendations for intervention modification included ( 1) start program at diagnosis , ( 2) maintain phone-based approach , and ( 3) expand topics and modify format. Patients and caregivers unanimously found the intervention to be helpful and acceptable. After incorporating modifications , ENABLE CHF-PC is currently undergoing efficacy testing in a large randomized controlled trial.
