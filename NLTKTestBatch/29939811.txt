 To describe the use of sport simulation activities as a form of implicit motor learning training with a geriatric former athlete following a stroke. An active 76-year-old former professional male softball player presented to outpatient physical therapy with medical history of right stroke with left hemiparesis<symptom> 2 weeks following onset of symptoms<symptom> of impaired balance<symptom> , coordination<symptom> , gait , and motor planning. Initial physical therapy included gait , balance<symptom> , and coordination<symptom> training. Additional sport-related balance<symptom> and coordination<symptom> activities were later added to the treatment plan. After approximately 3 weeks of treatment , the patient was able to return to work and had dramatically improved balance<symptom> , coordination<symptom> , and gait with sport simulation activities. Implicit motor learning techniques were incorporated through sport and job task simulation activities along with task-oriented neuromuscular reeducation. The patient demonstrated improvements with gait , balance<symptom> , gross motor function , and decreased fall risk.
