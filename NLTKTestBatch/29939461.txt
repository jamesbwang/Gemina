 Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> E<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> genotype 3 ( HEV-3) can lead to chronic<disease> infection<disease> in immunocompromised patients , and ribavirin is the treatment of choice. Recently , mutations in the polymerase gene have been associated with ribavirin failure but their frequency before treatment according to HEV-3 subtypes has not been studied on a large data set. We used single-molecule real-time sequencing technology to sequence 115 new complete genomes of HEV-3 infecting French patients. We analyzed phylogenetic relationships , the length of the polyproline region , and mutations in the HEV<pathogen> polymerase gene. Eighty-five ( 74 %) were in the clade HEV-3efg , 28 ( 24 %) in HEV-3chi clade , and 2 ( 2 %) in HEV-3ra clade. Using automated partitioning of maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees , complete genomes were classified into subtypes. Polyproline region length differs within HEV-3 clades ( from 189 to 315 nt). Investigating mutations in the polymerase gene , distinct polymorphisms between HEV-3 subtypes were found ( G1634R in 95 % of HEV-3e , G1634K in 56 % of HEV-3ra , and V1479I in all HEV-3efg , clade HEV-3ra , and HEV-3k strains). Subtype-specific polymorphisms in the HEV-3 polymerase have been identified. Our study provides new complete genome sequences of HEV-3 that could be useful for comparing strains circulating in humans and the animal reservoir.
