 Concurrent presentation of acute hepatitis<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HAV<pathogen>) infection<disease> and Graves ' disease<disease> has not been reported in literature worldwide. Although there is no well-established mechanism that explains the induction of Graves ' disease<disease> by HAV<pathogen> to date , our case suggests that HAV<pathogen> infection<disease> may be responsible for inducing Graves ' disease<disease>. A healthy 27-year-old female presented fever<symptom> , palpitation , and<symptom> diarrhea<disease> , and she was subsequently diagnosed as acute HAV<pathogen> infection<disease>. Concurrently , she showed hyperthyroidism , and the diagnosis was made as Graves ' disease<disease>. She had never had symptoms<symptom> that suggested hyperthyroidism , and previous thyroid function test was normal. Acute HAV<pathogen> infection<disease> was recovered by conservative management , however , thyroid dysfunction was maintained even after normalization of liver enzymes. Methimazole was used to treat Graves ' disease<disease>. We report a case of concurrent acute HAV<pathogen> infection<disease> and Graves ' disease<disease> in a patient without preexisting thyroid disease<disease>. This suggests that HAV<pathogen> infection<disease> may be a trigger for an autoimmune thyroid disease<disease> in susceptible individuals.
