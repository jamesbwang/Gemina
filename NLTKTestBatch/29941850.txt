 Trigeminal-nerve-mediated headshaking represents a major welfare challenge for owners and veterinarians and is caused by a low threshold firing of the trigeminal nerve resulting in pain manifested as violent head<disease> jerking that often terminates the horse & rsquo; s career and life due to poor quality of life and suffering. As metabolic changes such as acid ⁻ base status<symptom> and electrolytes play a role in nerve firing , this study sought to assess the effects following administration of hypertonic solutions on headshaking behavior in affected horses. This prospective randomized controlled crossover design utilized six horses affected with trigeminal-mediated headshaking and three treatment groups receiving intravenous administration of 5 % dextrose solution at 2 mL/kg bwt ( DS) , NaCl 7.5 % at 4 mL/kg bwt ( HS) , or NaHCO ₃ 8.4 % at 2 mmol/kg bwt ( HB). Horses were assessed for headshaking behavior changes at times T0 ( baseline , before infusion) and T15 , 30 , 60 , 120 min post infusion. Venous blood variables: pH , HCO ₃
