 Intramedullary spinal<disease> cord abscesses<symptom> ( ISCA) are a rare pathological entity with very few cases reported in the world and may be confused with an intramedullary tumor. Cervical location is the least frequently affected , except for cryptogenic spread , mostly seen in adult patients. Meticulous study of contrast-enhanced MRI pictures has a key role in the diagnosis. We present a case of a spontaneous cervical ISCA , mimicking a spinal<disease> cord tumor , in a pediatric patient with good outcome. A review of the literature shows that this is a life-threatening condition with high chances of rupture and subsequent meningitis<disease><symptom>. We point out that if a solitary cervical spinal<disease> cord lesion<symptom> is surrounded by significant medullar edema<symptom> associated with fast onset of symptoms<symptom> , fever<symptom> , and elevation of WBC , the possibility of a spinal<disease> cord abscess<symptom> should be considered prior to surgery.
