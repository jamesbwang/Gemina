 Pesticide poisoning<disease> is always a clinical conundrum for the emergency physician ( EP) , the complexity of which increases when the pesticide has no antidote! Over the past decade , there has been a sharp increase in cases of Amitraz poisoning<disease> , a pesticide routinely used in veterinary medicine , available without a prescription. The usual presentation includes bradycardia<symptom> , hypotension<symptom> , poor sensorium , and miosis. In the absence of accurate history , these clinical features can be confused with the cholinergic toxidrome of organophosphorus poisoning<disease>. There is a dearth of literature regarding the presentation and protocols for the management of Amitraz poisoning<disease> with data mostly based on animal studies and pediatric case reports. Currently , the available medical literature in the form of case reports and case series form an invaluable source of information to the EP to formulate a working diagnosis and methodical approach to this pesticide. Here , we present two case reports highlighting the characteristic clinical features and bringing to light how an organized approach to the toxin can give satisfactory results.
