 Objectives To evaluate the women , infants , and children ( WIC) Oral Health Program in a county in Florida. Methods The non-traditional interdisciplinary program of the current study was designed to reach at-risk populations with untreated dental diseases<disease> and limited access to care; it provides oral health education , dental screenings , preventive dental services , and referrals for women , children , and families at WIC offices. We evaluated the health status<symptom> of patients enrolled in the program and the services provided. Results From 2013 to 2016 , the program provided dental screenings for 576 children and 180 women. Caries<disease> prevalence for 3-5 year olds was 46.0 %. Only 6.6 % ( 12/114) of pregnant women were eligible for comprehensive dental care under Medicaid ( < 21 years). Further , 71.2 % ( 47/66) of all pregnant women had unmet dental care needs. Conclusions for Practice Our results suggested that many children and women had untreated dental diseases<disease> and need preventive services and dental care. Also , many pregnant women were not covered by Medicaid. This program demonstrates that collaboration with the WIC program can improve access to oral health services for underserved populations.
