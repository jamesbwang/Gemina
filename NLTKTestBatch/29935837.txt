 To investigate the feasibility and safety of the EXOSEAL vascular closure device ( VCD) in achieving hemostasis in transpopliteal arterial interventions. Between May 2014 and May 2016 , 46 procedures involving transpopliteal arterial access in 28 patients ( 18 bilateral and 10 unilateral) were analyzed retrospectively. Popliteal arterial puncture was performed under ultrasonographic ( US) and fluoroscopic guidance by using a micropuncture access set with a 21-gauge needle. Six-French sheaths were used in 45 procedures , and a 7-F sheath was used in 1 procedure. Hemostasis was achieved with the EXOSEAL VCD. All patients were examined for any access-related complications with US at 6 and 24 hours after the procedure. One week later , all patients were followed up in the outpatient clinic. In 44 of the 46 procedures , the EXOSEAL VCD was applied successfully. The technical failure rate was 4.4 %. An excessively steep angle of the introducer sheath and improper placement of the EXOSEAL plug in the setting of high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( 220/120 mm Hg) were the reasons for the 2 failures<symptom>. Among the 44 successful procedures , 1 ( 2.3 %) minor 3-cm hematoma was found to be associated with the VCD. In 1 of the 46 procedures , an arteriovenous fistula<disease> ( 2.2 %) was observed as a puncture-related complication and treated with a stent graft. The EXOSEAL VCD can be safely used for hemostasis in interventions that use transpopliteal arterial approaches , with a high technical success rate and a low rate of entry-site complications.
