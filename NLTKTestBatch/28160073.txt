 Morphine is commonly used to treat severe<symptom> pain<symptom>. This substance is significantly metabolized in the liver and causes disturbing effects. Genistein is an isoflavone and has antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of genistein against morphine damages on mouse liver. Between May 2017 and March 2018 , 48 male mice were divided into six groups ( n = 8 in each group). Various doses of genistein ( 25 and 50 mg/kg) and morphine plus genistein ( 25 and 50 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally to 48 male mice for 20 consequent days. Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) , serum nitric oxide ( NO) levels , liver weight , and the diameter of hepatocytes and central hepatic vein were studied and compared using one-way analysis of variance. Morphine administration significantly increased the mean diameter of the central hepatic vein ( 22.76 ± 1.9 μm vs. 15.04 ± 0.60 μm , χ It seems that genistein administration might improve liver damages induced by morphine in mice.
