 Nasal obstruction is a common presenting symptom<symptom> to clinicians and affects up to one-third of the population. There are several factors that cause nasal obstruction , including anatomic , physiologic , and pathophysiologic factors. The anatomy and physiology of nasal obstruction is complicated and is influenced by patency of nasal passages , mucociliary function , airflow receptors , autonomic function , and degree of mucosal inflammation<symptom>. Common anatomic causes include internal nasal valve stenosis/collapse , septal deviation , and turbinate hypertrophy. Common physiologic causes include sinonasal inflammatory disorders and iatrogenic causes.
