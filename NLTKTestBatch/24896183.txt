 Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR) is crucial for signaling mediated by stress-induced high levels of glucocorticoids. The lateral nucleus of the amygdala ( LA) is a key structure underlying auditory-cued fear conditioning. Here , we demonstrate that genetic disruption of GR in the LA ( LAGRKO) resulted in an auditory-cued fear memory deficit for strengthened conditioning. Furthermore , the suppressive effect of a single restraint stress ( RS) prior to conditioning on auditory-cued fear memory in floxed GR ( control) mice was abolished in LAGRKO mice. Optogenetic induction of long-term depression<symptom> ( LTD) at auditory inputs to the LA reduced auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice , and in contrast , optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation ( LTP) increased auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed floxed GR mice. These findings suggest that prior stress suppresses fear conditioning-induced LTP at auditory inputs to the LA in a GR-dependent manner , thereby protecting animals from encoding excessive cued fear memory under stress conditions.
