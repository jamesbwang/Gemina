 Lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 ( OLR1) locates within the area of chromosome 12p , which has been identified as the AD-susceptible region , and plays a role in lipid metabolism. Therefore , it has been suggested to be a good candidate gene for Alzheimer 's disease<disease> ( AD). Several SNPs within OLR1 have been reported to have association with AD among Caucasians. We selected and genotyped three SNPs ( rs1050283 , rs1050286 , rs17808009) in OLR1 to investigate its possible relationship with the onset of late-onset Alzheimer disease<disease> ( LOAD) in 984 LOAD cases and 1,354 healthy controls among northern Han Chinese. No significant association was found between the OLR1 ( rs1050283 , rs1050286 , rs17808009) polymorphisms and LOAD , even after adjustment for gender and age and stratification for apolipoprotein E ( APOE) status<symptom>. Our study showed that the SNPs ( rs1050283 , rs1050286 , rs17808009) located in the 3 ` UTR of OLR1 may not involve in the mechanism of LOAD in Han Chinese population.
