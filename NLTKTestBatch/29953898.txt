 In this study , we examined how any , full , and partial breastfeeding durations were associated with maternal risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease<disease> ( CVD) , and how prepregnancy body mass index ( BMI) and waist circumference 7 years postpartum influenced these associations. A total of 63,260 women with live-born singleton infants in the Danish National Birth Cohort ( 1996-2002) were included. Interviews during pregnancy and 6 and 18 months postpartum provided information on prepregnancy weight<symptom> , height , and the duration of full and partial breastfeeding. Waist circumference was self-reported 7 years postpartum. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios of incident hypertension and CVD , registered in the National Patient Register from either 18 months or 7 years postpartum through 15 years postpartum. Any breastfeeding ≥ 4 months was associated with 20-30 % lower risks of hypertension and CVD compared to < 4 months in both normal/underweight and overweight/obese women. At follow-up starting 7 years postpartum , similar risk reductions were observed after accounting for waist circumference adjusted for BMI. Partial breastfeeding > 2 months compared to ≤ 2 months , following up to 6 months of full breastfeeding , was associated with 10-25 % lower risk of hypertension and CVD. Compared with short breastfeeding duration , additional partial breastfeeding was as important as additional full breastfeeding in reducing risk of hypertension and CVD. Altogether , longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with lower maternal risk of hypertension and CVD irrespective of prepregnancy BMI and abdominal adiposity 7 years after delivery. Both full and partial breastfeeding contributed to an improved cardiovascular health in mothers.
