 Few data exist regarding predictors of rapid aortic root dilation and referral for aortic surgery in Marfan syndrome<symptom> ( MFS). To identify independent predictors of the rate of aortic root ( AoR) dilation and referral for aortic surgery , we investigated the data from the Pediatric Heart Network randomized trial of atenolol versus losartan in young patients with MFS. Data were analyzed from the echocardiograms at 0 , 12 , 24 , and 36 months read in the core laboratory of 608 trial subjects , aged 6 months to 25 years , who met original Ghent criteria and had an AoR z-score ( AoRz) > 3. Repeated measures linear and logistic regressions were used to determine multivariable predictors of AoR dilation. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine cut-points in AoR dilation predicting referral for aortic surgery. Multivariable analysis showed rapid AoR dilation as defined by change in AoRz/year > 90th percentile was associated with older age , higher sinotubular junction z-score , and atenolol use ( R
