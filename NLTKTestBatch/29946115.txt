 The consumption of antioxidant-rich cooking oil such as red palm olein may be cardioprotective from the perspective of subclinical inflammation and endothelial function. Using a crossover design , we conducted a randomised controlled trial in 53 free-living high-risk abdominally overweight subjects , comparing the effects of incorporating red palm olein ( with palm olein as control) in a supervised isocaloric 2100 kcal diet of 30 % en fat , two-thirds ( 45 g/day) of which were derived from the test oil for a period of 6 weeks each. We did not observe a significant change in interleukin-6 ( IL-6) , in parallel with other pro-inflammatory ( tumour necrosis<symptom> factor-β , interleukin-1β , IL-1β , high sensitivity C-reactive protein , hsCRP) and endothelial function ( soluble intercellular adhesion molecules , sICAM , soluble intravascular adhesion molecules , sVCAM) parameters. Interestingly , we observed a significant reduction in oxidised LDL levels ( P < 0.0386) while on the red palm olein diet , together with the increase in plasma alpha tocopherol ( P < 0.0002) , alpha carotene ( P < 0.0001) and beta carotene ( P < 0.0001) concentrations compared with palm olein diet. Red palm olein did not improve subclinical inflammation and endothelial function despite profound increase in antioxidant levels. The positive improvement in oxidised LDL merits further attention in this group of subjects at risk of developing cardiovascular disease<disease>.
