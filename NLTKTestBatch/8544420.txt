 Persistent significant proteinuria<symptom> has been associated with increased risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease<disease> in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy ( IMN). Rituximab ( RTX) therapy has given encouraging results in IMN , but most of the studies have used a higher dose , which is limited by the high cost as well as a potential increased risk of infections. Our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose RTX in patients with immunosuppression-resistant IMN. A total of 21 patients with treatment-resistant IMN treated with RTX from 2015 to 2016 at our center were included in the study. They received two doses of RTX ( 500 mg each) infusion 7 days apart. CD19 count was performed after 4 weeks. A single dose of RTX was repeated after 4-6 weeks if CD19 count was not depleted. The mean standard deviation age of patients was 33.3 ± 12.3 years and 33.3 % were females. Mean proteinuria<symptom> before RTX therapy was 6.2 ± 2.2 g/day , serum creatinine was 0.9 ± 0.3 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) was 95.8 ± 26.9 mL/min/1 .73 m Low-dose RTX therapy is effective and safe in immunosuppression-resistant IMN.
