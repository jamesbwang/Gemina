 In spite of having BCG vaccination and tuberculosis<disease> control program for the last 50 years , prevalence of tuberculosis<disease> continues to be high in India. Inadequate diagnostic methods , suboptimal treatment and monitoring , and the lack of vigilant reporting system are some of the contributing factors for the failure of TB control. To know the current practices among local pediatricians regarding management of TB. Field based cross sectional study. All the registered pediatricians who were practicing in Mangalore , ( list- local IAP branch) were included in the study. A structured Questionnaire on signs and symptoms<symptom> of TB , diagnosis , strategies adopted in treatment , MDR tuberculosis<disease> and reporting of cases to RNTCP was asked. Management practice standards according to the Updated National Guidelines for Pediatric Tuberculosis in India , 2012 , RNTCP guidelines in consensus with IAP , latest at the time of the study. 50 pediatricians participated in the study with 62 % having an attachment to the teaching institution. More than 50 % identified all the symptoms<symptom> of TB. 64 % were sending chest X-ray , Mantoux test and gastric lavage/induced sputum<symptom> examination for AFB to diagnose TB. 22 % were not stressing for AFB examination. Still 16 % told serological tests as one of the diagnostic modality. 52 % were not aware about the diagnosis of latent TB. In 16 % of their cases ATT was on a trial basis. Only 52 % of the clinicians are adhering to updated national ( RNTCP) guidelines. 30 % felt still there are drawbacks in the current RNTCP guidelines. 72 % knew the correct definition of MDR tuberculosis<disease>. But only 36 % of them knew the diagnostic method ( gene expert/CB NAAT) of confirming the MDR TB. Management practices are found to be still suboptimum. Better engagement of the private sector is urgently required to improve TB management practices and to prevent diagnostic delay and drug resistance.
