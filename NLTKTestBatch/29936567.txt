 To determine the correlation of preoperative fascia thickness ( FT) and intraoperative fascia preservation ( FP) with erectile function ( EF) after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy ( RARP). Our analysis included 106 patients , with localized prostate cancer and no erectile dysfunction ( ED) before RARP , assessed with preoperative 3 Tesla ( 3 T) multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). FP score was defined as the extent of FP from the base to the apex of the prostate , quantitatively assessed by the surgeon. Median fascia thickness ( MFT) per patient was defined as the sum of the median FT of 12 MRI regions. Preserved MFT ( pMFT) was the sum of the saved MFT. The percentage of pFMT ( ppMFT) was also calculated. Fascia surface ( FS) was measured on MRI and it was combined with FP score resulting in preserved FS ( pFS) and percentage of pFS ( ppFS). FP score , pMFT , ppMFT , pFS and ppFS were significantly lower ( p < 0.0001) in patients with ED. In the multivariate regression analysis , lower FP score ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.721 , p = 0.03) and lower ppMFT ( OR 0.001 , p = 0.027) were independent predictors of ED. ROC analysis showed the highest area under the curve for ppMFT ( 0.787) and FP score ( 0.767) followed by pMFT ( 0.755) and ppFS ( 0.743). MRI-determined periprostatic FT combined with intraoperative FP score are correlated to postprostatectomy EF. Based on the hypothesis that a thicker fascia forms a protective layer for the nerves<symptom> , we recommend assessing FT preoperatively to counsel men for the odds of preserving EF after RARP.
