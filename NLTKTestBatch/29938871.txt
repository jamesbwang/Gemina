 Alcohol overuse ( AOu) is considered an important risk factor for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH). The clinical and outcome characteristics of these patients ( AOu-ICH) are not well known. All patients with ICH admitted to a single university tertiary stroke center were prospectively studied from May 2005 to May 2015. Demographic profiles , radiologic characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with acute ICH and previous AOu ( > 40 g/day or > 300 g/week) were analyzed. During the study period , 555 patients with spontaneous primary ICH met the inclusion criteria. A total of 81 patients ( 14.6 %) reported AOu ( 24.3 % of men vs. 3.1 % of women; P < 0.0001; mean age , 63 years old for AOu vs. 74 years old for non-AOu; P < 0.0001). Of the classic cardiovascular risk factors , only smoking was associated with AOu ( 63 % vs. 12.2 % of non-AOu; P < 0.0001). Initial severity and hematoma volume were similar in both groups , with no observed differences in stroke care or in-hospital medical complications. Patients with AOu had worse outcome ( modified Rankin Scale score , 3-6 points) than patients without AOu at 3 months ( odds ratio ( OR) , 2.50; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.32-4.75; P = 0.005) and 12 months ( OR , 2.47; 95 % CI , 1.23-5.00; P = 0.011). A similar trend was observed at 5 years ( OR , 2.48; 95 % CI , 0.96-6.39; P = 0.059). Alcohol overuse was present in 14.6 % of patients with ICH , who were predominantly male , smokers and a mean of 11 years younger than the non-AOu group. Despite a lack of differences in initial clinical severity , stroke care and early medical complications , patients with AOu had worse short- and long-term outcomes.
