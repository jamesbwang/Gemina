 Cancer patients often have other noncancer medical conditions. Presence of comorbidities negatively affects cancer survival. The aim of this study was to investigate comorbidity , risk factors for comorbidity , and how comorbidity was associated with symptoms<symptom> and quality of life in patients being treated for breast cancer. One hundred and one breast cancer chemotherapy outpatients completed this study. Comorbid conditions , weight , height , and smoking status were identified by chart review. Symptoms<symptom> and quality of life were self-reported using psychometrically sound instruments. Log-linear regression analyses with age as the covariate examined impact of ethnicity , body mass index ( BMI) , and smoking on comorbidities. Approximately 84 % of the participants had 1 or more comorbid conditions. Adjusting for age , number of comorbidities differed by BMI ( P = .000); the obese group had significantly more comorbidities than the normal and overweight groups. The interaction between BMI and smoking was significant ( P = .047). The obese participants who smoked had significantly more comorbidities compared with those who were obese but did not smoke ( P = .001). More comorbid conditions were associated with greater pain ( P < .05) and poorer sleep quality ( P < .05). Comorbidity significantly correlated with symptoms<symptom> and functional aspects of quality of life ( P < .01 and P < .05 , respectively). A greater number of comorbidities was associated with lower physical and role functioning and worse fatigue<symptom> , dyspnea<symptom> , appetite<symptom> loss<symptom> , and nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> ( all P < .05). Comorbidity exerts negative impacts on symptoms<symptom> and quality of life. Weight and smoking status are strong determinants of breast cancer comorbidity. Personalized care planning , weight management , and smoking cessation may lead to better cancer outcomes.
