 Herein , the authors compare morbidity in men who underwent both transrectal ultrasound-guided ( TRUS) prostate biopsy and transperineal mapping biopsy ( TPMB) at two institutions with extensive experience in both procedures. We also identified strategies and predictive factors to reduce morbidity for both procedures. In our study , 379 men from two institutions , of which 265 ( 69.9 %) had a prior TRUS-guided biopsy , also had TPMB performed via a template with biopsies taken at 5-mm intervals. Men in the TRUS group had a median of 12 cores sampled whereas the TPMB group had 51.5 ( range , 16-151). The median biopsy density was 1.1 core/cc prostate volume. Median age and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) level were 65 years ( range , 34-86) and 5.5 ng/mL ( range , 0.02-118). Of these men , 11 of 265 ( 4.2 %) who had TRUS biopsy developed urinary<disease> tract<symptom><disease> infection<disease> compared with 3 of 379 ( 0.79 %) of those with mapping biopsy. Infection was 14.8 % in TRUS biopsy group with 13 or more cores versus 2.9 % in those with 12 or less ( OR , 5.8; 95 % CI , 1.6-21.2;
