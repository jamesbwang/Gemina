 Accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota affect the development and function of the immune system and may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases<disease>. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies reporting gastrointestinal microbiota aberrations associated with the systemic sclerosis disease<disease> state. The studies described herein have identified common changes in gut microbial composition. Specifically , patients with SSc have decreased abundance of beneficial commensal genera ( e.g. , Faecalibacterium , Clostridium<pathogen> , and Bacteroides) and increased abundance of pathobiont genera ( e.g. , Fusobacterium , Prevotella<pathogen> , Erwinia). In addition , some studies have linked specific genera with the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms<symptom> in systemic sclerosis. More research is needed to further characterize the gastrointestinal microbiota in systemic sclerosis and understand how microbiota perturbations can affect inflammation<symptom> , fibrosis<disease> , and clinical outcomes. Interventional studies aimed at addressing/correcting these perturbations , either through dietary modification , pro/pre-biotic supplementation , or fecal transplantation , may lead to improved outcomes for patients with systemic sclerosis.
