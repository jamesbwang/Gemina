 3-Spiropiperidino indolenines have been synthesized via novel Lewis acid-catalyzed SN2-type ring opening of activated aziridines with 1H-indoles followed by Pd-catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization with propargyl carbonates in up to 88 % yields. The step and pot-economic transformation comprises sequential C-C , C-N , and C-C bond forming steps generating two stereogenic centers including an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter to furnish the products in diastereomerically pure ( dr > 99: 1) forms with excellent enantiomeric excess<symptom> ( ee up to > 99 %). The synthetic versatility of the strategy has been illustrated by converting the synthesized products into spirocyclic indolenine 2-piperidinones , dihydropiperidines , and 5-alkynylated piperidines.
