 The progesterone receptor ( PGR) plays a central role in maintaining pregnancy and is significantly associated with medical conditions such as preterm birth that affects 12.6 % of all the births<symptom> in U.S. PGR has been evolving rapidly since the common ancestor of human and chimpanzee , and we herein investigated evolutionary dynamics of PGR during recent human migration and population differentiation. Our study revealed substantial population differentiation at the PGR locus driven by natural selection , where very recent positive selection in East Asians has substantially decreased its genetic diversity by nearly fixing evolutionarily novel alleles. On the contrary , in European populations , the PGR locus has been promoted to a highly polymorphic state likely due to balancing selection. Integrating transcriptome data across multiple tissue types together with large-scale genome-wide association data for preterm birth , our study demonstrated the consequence of the selection event in East Asians on remodeling PGR expression specifically in the ovary and determined a significant association of early spontaneous preterm birth with the evolutionarily selected variants. To reconstruct its evolutionary trajectory on the human lineage , we observed substantial differentiation between modern and archaic humans at the PGR locus , including fixation of a deleterious missense allele in the Neanderthal genome that was later introgressed in modern human populations. Taken together , our study revealed substantial evolutionary innovation in PGR even during very recent human evolution , and its different forms among human populations likely result in differential susceptibility to progesterone-associated disease<disease> conditions including preterm birth.
