 A series of substituted , pyridyl-functionalized 2,4,6-triarylpyrylium salts were prepared and investigated for their light absorption and emission properties. After reaction with P ( SiMe3) 3 , the corresponding λ3-phosphinines were obtained , which carry on the 4- or 6-aryl ring ± I and ± M substituents. Supported by DFT calculations , a systematic evaluation of the σ-donor and π-donor as well as π-acceptor properties of these low-coordinate P,N-hybrid ligands was performed. The modular synthetic approach allowed us at the same time to synthesize the structurally related bipyridine derivatives for comparison reasons. Reaction of the chelating ligands with ( W ( CO) 6) in THF afforded the corresponding ( ( P ^ N) W ( CO) 4) and ( ( N ^ N) W ( CO) 4) complexes. A crystallographic characterization of selected coordination<symptom> compounds revealed significant structural differences between the pyridyl-phosphinine- and the bipyridine-based compounds. Their characterization by means of IR-spectroscopy gave experimental insight into the electronic properties of the respective ligands.
