 To evaluate , in vitro , the effect of mouth<symptom> rinse exposure on bleached enamel. Enamel/dentin bovine blocks ( 4 × 4 × 2 mm) were bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide ( HP) and were submitted to immersion twice daily for 14 days with different rinses ( n = 10) , including those involving: distilled water ( C ( control)) , 225-ppm NaF ( FM , Colgate Plax Classic) , essential oil ( EM , Listerine Tartar Control) , 1.5 % hydrogen peroxide ( HPM , Colgate Plax Whitening) , and 2 % hydrogen peroxide , pyrophosphates , and 225-ppm NaF ( HPM+P , Colgate ® Luminous White<symptom>). The specimens were stored in a remineralizing solution during all experiments. Analyses of color ( ΔE , L * , a * , b *) and roughness ( Ra) were performed at the baseline , after HP , and after exposure to the rinse. The cross-sectional microhardness ( CSMH) and images by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) were assessed at the end. The data were subjected to analysis of variance ( ANOVA) ( ΔE) , repeated measures ANOVA ( Ra) , and split-plot ANOVA ( CSMH) , followed by the Tukey test. The L * , a * , and b * values were analyzed by generalized linear models ( α = 0.05). Color<symptom> changes<symptom> were not statistically different in the groups. Ra increased in all groups after bleaching; however , it was reestablished in C , FM , and HPM+F and increased in EM after 14 days of the rinse. EM and HPM reduced the CSMH values differing from C and promoted alterations on the enamel surface visualized by SEM. The mouth<symptom> rinses did not affect the whitening efficacy or promote benefits on bleached enamel properties. Moreover , the 1.5 % hydrogen peroxide- or essential oil-based mouth<symptom> rinses affected the bleached enamel properties , promoting an alteration in morphologic surface and mineral loss in depth.
