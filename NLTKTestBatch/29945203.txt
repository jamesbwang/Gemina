 To report patient-reported outcomes of patients with PsA treated with ixekizumab up to 52 weeks. In SPIRIT-P1 , biologic-naïve patients with active PsA were randomized to ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks ( IXEQ4W; N = 107) or every 2 weeks ( IXEQ2W; N = 103) following a 160 mg starting dose , adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks ( ADA; N = 101) or placebo ( PBO; N = 106) during the initial 24-week double-blind treatment period. At week 24 ( week 16 for inadequate responders) , ADA ( 8-week washout before starting ixekizumab) and PBO patients were re-randomized to IXEQ2W or IXEQ4W. Patients receiving ixekizumab at week 24 received the same dose during the extension period ( EP) to week 52. Patients completed measures including the Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI) , Itch Numeric Rating Scale , 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 , European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions Visual Analogue Scale and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Specific Health Problem. The IXEQ4W , IXEQ2W and ADA groups reported significant improvements in DLQI at week 24; 22 % ( PBO) , 53 % ( IXEQ4W) , 63 % ( IXEQ2W) and 54 % ( ADA) of patients reported DLQI scores of 0/1. The IXEQ4W , IXEQ2W and ADA groups reported significant improvements in Itch Numeric Rating Scale , 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 physical component summary and some domain scores , and European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions Visual Analogue Scale at weeks 12 and 24; and in three of four Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Specific Health Problem domains at week 24. Results are also presented through week 52 for the EP. In biologic-naïve patients with active PsA , ixekizumab significantly improved skin<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , health-related quality of life and work productivity.
