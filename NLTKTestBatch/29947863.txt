 We determined the prevalence of untreated depression<symptom> in patients with hypertension ( HT) and/or diabetes ( DM) and estimated the extra health care use and expenditures associated with this comorbidity in a rural Hungarian adult population. We also assessed the potential workload of systematic screening for depression<symptom> in this patient group. General health check database from a primary care programme containing survey data of 2027 patients with HT and/or DM was linked to the outpatient secondary care use database of National Institute of Health Insurance Fund Management. Depression<symptom> was ascertained by Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory score and antidepressant drug use. The association between untreated depression<symptom> and secondary healthcare utilization indicated by number of visits and expenses was evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis controlled for socioeconomic/lifestyle factors and comorbidity. The age- , sex- and education-specific observations were used to estimate the screening workload for an average general medical practice. The frequency of untreated depression<symptom> was 27.08 %. The untreated severe<symptom> depression<symptom> ( 7.45 %) was associated with increased number of visits ( OR 1.60 , 95 % CI 1.11-2.31) and related expenses ( OR 2.20 , 95 % CI 1.50-3.22) in a socioeconomic status-independent manner. To identify untreated depression<symptom> cases among patients with HT and/or DM , an average GP has to screen 42 subjects a month. It seems to be reasonable and feasible to screen for depression<symptom> in patients with HT and/or DM in the primary care , in order to detect cases without treatment ( which may be associated with increase of secondary care visits and expenditures) and to initiate the adequate treatment of them.
