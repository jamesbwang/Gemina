 Acute kidney injury ( AKI) occurs in 6.1 % -22.4 % of patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. Previous studies have shown no association between intraoperative urine output and postoperative acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , these studies used various definitions of acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. We therefore investigated the association between intraoperative oliguria and postoperative AKI defined by the serum creatinine criteria of the Risk , Injury , Failure , Loss , and End-stage kidney disease<disease> ( RIFLE) classification. In this single-center , retrospective , observational study , we screened 26,984 patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery during the period September 1 , 2008 to October 31 , 2011 at a university hospital. Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; duration of anesthesia < 120 minutes; hospital stay < 2 nights<symptom>; local anesthesia only; urologic or cardiac surgery; coexisting end-stage kidney disease<disease>; and absence of serum creatinine measurement , intraoperative urine output data , or information regarding intraoperative drug use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used as the primary analytic method. A total of 5894 patients were analyzed. The incidence of postoperative AKI was 7.3 %. By multivariable analysis , ≥ 120 minutes of oliguria ( odds ratio = 2.104 , 95 % CI , 1.593-2.778; P < .001) was independently associated with the development of postoperative AKI. After propensity-score matching of patients with ≥ 120 and < 120 minutes of oliguria on baseline characteristics , the incidence of AKI in patients with ≥ 120 minutes of oliguria ( n = 827; 10 %) was significantly greater than that in those with < 120 minutes of oliguria ( n = 827; 4.8 %; odds ratio = 2.195 , 95 % CI , 1.806-2.668; P < .001). Contrary to previous studies , we found that intraoperative oliguria is associated with the incidence of AKI after major noncardiac surgery.
