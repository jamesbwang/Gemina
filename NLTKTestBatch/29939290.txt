 RNA processing is critical for proper spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ubiquitous nuclear polyadenosine RNA binding protein , PABPN1 , post-transcriptionally regulates multiple steps of gene expression. Mutations in the PABPN1 gene expanding an N-terminal alanine tract<symptom> in the PABPN1 protein from 10 alanines to 11-18 alanines cause the muscle-specific disease<disease> oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy ( OPMD) , which affects eyelid , pharynx , and proximal<symptom> limb<symptom> muscles. Previous work revealed that the Pabpn1 transcript is unstable , contributing to low steady-state Pabpn1 mRNA and protein levels in vivo , specifically in skeletal muscle , with even lower levels in muscles affected in OPMD. Thus , low levels of PABPN1 protein could predispose specific tissues to pathology in OPMD. However , no studies have defined the mechanisms that regulate Pabpn1 expression. Here , we define multiple cis-regulatory elements and a trans-acting factor , HuR , which regulate Pabpn1 expression specifically in mature muscle in vitro and in vivo. We exploit multiple models including C2C12 myotubes , primary muscle cells , and mice to determine that HuR decreases Pabpn1 expression. Overall , we have uncovered a mechanism in mature muscle that negatively regulates Pabpn1 expression in vitro and in vivo , which could provide insight to future studies investigating therapeutic strategies for OPMD treatment.
