 Iron-based nanoparticles ( FeNPs) have unique and attractive properties such as superparamagnetism , biocompatibility and catalytic activity. Although the synthesis of precious metal NPs from a metal in liquid and/or metal salt solution by a pulsed laser has been well reported , little has been examined about the production of FeNPs. Here we report the synthesis of spherical NPs of iron oxide ( magnetite) without wearing carbon shells from ferrocene hexane solution by femtosecond NIR laser pulses<symptom>. Nanosecond UV laser is also used to compare the time evolutions of the particle size distribution. The size of NPs remains constant even by the long-term femtosecond laser irradiation , whereas it grows with nanosecond laser pulses<symptom>. The primary particles are generated by photochemical reactions regardless of pulse durations; however , the fragmentation of NPs by the successive femtosecond laser pulses<symptom> regulates the particle size.
