 Circulating amino acids have been associated with both appetite<symptom> and the secretion of anorexigenic hormones in healthy and obese populations. This effect has not been investigated in subjects having undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery ( RYGB). To investigate the association between postprandial plasma concentrations of amino acids and the anorexigenic hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine ( PYY) , the orexigenic hormone ghrelin , and satiety and hunger in post-RYGB subjects. A Dutch surgical department. Participants after primary RYGB were studied during a Mixed<disease> Meal Tolerance Test ( MMTT). Satiety and hunger were assessed every 30 minutes on visual analogue scales. Blood samples were collected at baseline , every 10 minutes during the first half hour and every 30 minutes until 210 minutes after the start. The samples were assessed for 24 amino acids and 3 gastrointestinal hormones. Incremental areas under the curve ( iAUCs) were calculated. Exploratory analyses were performed in which subjects were divided into high and low responders depending on the median iAUC. 42 subjects , aged 48 ± 11 ( mean ± SD) years , 31 to 76 months post-RYGB and with total weight<symptom> loss<symptom> of 30 ± 9 % completed the MMTT. Subjects with high satiety scores had more than a 25 % higher net iAUC of PYY and GLP-1 and at least a 10 % higher net iAUC of 10 amino acids compared to subjects with low scores ( P < 0.05). The net iAUC of five of these amino acids ( i.e. arginine , asparagine , histidine , serine and threonine) was more than 10 % higher in subjects with high responses on GLP-1 and/or PYY ( P < 0.05). Certain postprandial amino acids were associated with satiety and anorexigenic hormones and could therefore play a role in appetite<symptom> regulation after RYGB; either by a direct effect on satiety , indirectly through gastrointestinal hormones , or both.
