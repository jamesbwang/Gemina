 This systematic literature review compared the epidemiological ( EPI) research and the qualitative social and behavioral science ( SBS) research published during the West Africa Ebola<disease> virus<pathogen><disease> disease<disease> ( EVD) epidemic. Beginning with an initial capture of over 2,000 articles , we extracted 236 EPI and 171 SBS studies to examine how disciplinary priorities affected research conducted during the EVD response , with implications for epidemic response effectiveness. Building on this research , we set forth a roadmap for the closer integration of EPI and SBS research in all aspects of epidemic preparedness and<symptom> response<symptom> that incorporates the lessons of the West Africa EVD outbreak. Key priorities include: ( 1) developing the capacity to systematically quantify qualitative sociocultural variables , ( 2) establishing interdisciplinary collaborations to improve `` risk segmentation '' practices , ( 3) creating and pre-positioning qualitative indicators and composite sociocultural indexes for rapid deployment in outbreaks; ( 4) integrating novel systems with community resources; ( 5) developing new techniques for modeling social mobilization and community engagement; ( 6) prioritizing good data and complex analyses early in emergencies , and ( 7) learning from past experiences. Our findings support a program of action that situates data collection and analysis in real-time , recursive , integrated efforts to move community attitudes , behaviors , and<symptom> responses<symptom> into epidemiological research.
