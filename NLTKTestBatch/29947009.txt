 Thulium laser vaporesection ( ThuVARP) and bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate ( B-TURP) are novel surgeries for benign prostate hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH). This paper is a systematic review and analysis of literatures comparing efficacy indicators , operative parameters , as well as safety indicators between ThuVARP and B-TURP for the treatment of BPH. A systematic search of electronic databases , including PubMed , the Cochrane Library , Web of Science , Embase , and China National Knowledge Internet ( CNKI) , was carried out up to December 1 , 2015 ( updated on March 1 , 2016). The captivating outcomes included basic clinical characteristics , perioperative parameters , local complications , and efficacy indicators which included International Prostate Symptom<symptom> Score ( IPSS) , quality of life ( QoL) , maximum flow rate ( Qmax) , and postvoid residual ( PVR). After assessing the quality of methodology and extracting data , a meta-analysis was carried out by using STATA 12.0 software. Five studies involving 500 patients met the standard. The outcomes of this analysis were as follows: ( a) efficacy indicators: there were no significant differences in IPSS , QoL , PVR , and Qmax between the two groups ( all P > 0.05); ( b) perioperative indicators: ThuVARP had longer operative time ( standardized mean difference ( SMD) = 0.843; 95 % confidence interval ( CI)- 0.391 , 1.296; P < 0.001) but less serum hemoglobin decreased ( SMD =- 0.561; 95 % CI- 0.796 ,- 0.327; P < 0.001) , shorter hospital stay ( SMD =- 1.558; 95 % CI- 2.709 ,- 0.407; P < 0.01) , and catheterization time ( SMD =- 1.274; 95 % CI- 2.158 ,- 0.390; P < 0.01). Additionally , no significant difference was found in estimated resected weight<symptom> ( P > 0.05); ( c) safety indicators: no significant difference was found in local complication rates ( all P > 0.05) between ThuVARP and B-TURP. In our analysis , there exists no statistical difference between ThuVARP and B-TURP group in efficacy. However , in spite of requiring longer surgical time , ThuVARP was better in terms of less blood<symptom> loss<symptom> as well as shorter hospitalization and catheterization time.
