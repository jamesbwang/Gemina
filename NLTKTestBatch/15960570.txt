 To overcome nonadherence in patients with psychosis switch to long-acting injectable ( LAI) antipsychotic formulations is adopted. Most oral versus LAI comparisons showed similar antipsychotic responses. Psychoses often overlap with substance use disorder ( SUD). Head-to-head LAI comparisons have hitherto focused only on non-comorbid populations. The objective of this study was to compare two LAIs , administered for 12 months , in initially hospitalized patients with psychosis comorbid with SUD in their clinical and quality of life ( QoL) outcomes. Inpatients were recruited during 2016 and switched randomly to 400 mg intramuscular aripiprazole monohydrate ( AM) ( N = 50) or to 100 mg intramuscular paliperidone palmitate ( PP) once-monthly ( N = 51); patients were discharged and followed up for 12 months. Patients were rated at baseline and after 1 year through the Clinical Global Impression scale- severity ( CGIs) , substance craving intensity was rated through a visual analog scale for substance craving , and QoL through the World Health Organization ( WHOQOL-BREF) scale. We addressed confounders with backward stepwise logistic regression and three-way analysis of variance. PP were older and had more cases of schizophrenia spectrum and less bipolar disorders than AM , but AM had a stronger craving for substances at baseline. Both LAIs were associated with significant improvements in all outcomes , with AM displaying stronger effect sizes than PP. The two groups did not differ on baseline WHOQOL-BREF scores in any domain , but at the 1-year follow-up , AM fared better on all domains. The two groups did not differ in final severity , but PP scored higher than AM in craving at the 1-year endpoint. 1-year AM and PP was followed by improved clinical status<symptom> and QoL and reduced substance craving in a population with psychosis and SUD comorbidity. AM , compared to PP , improved craving and QoL at the 1-year follow-up.
