- Making an accurate diagnosis for melanocytic lesions<symptom> has always been challenging for pathologists , especially when dealing with difficult-to-diagnose cases. Misdiagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic lesions<symptom> in general has tremendous medical-legal implications , often leading to unnecessary and excessive use of adjunctive tests. Although molecular testing is of much interest and there is great support for its development , currently , for most melanocytic lesions<symptom> , immunohistochemical studies remain the most practical method for assistance in the routine diagnosis of melanocytic lesions<symptom> for the average pathologist.- To review the practical use of p16 immunohistochemistry for evaluating melanocytic lesions<symptom> , particularly for differentiating benign from malignant tumors , and to perform a meta-analysis of primary studies evaluating p16 immunohistochemistry in melanocytic lesions<symptom>.- A PubMed database search for literature reporting melanocytic lesions<symptom> and p16 immunohistochemistry was performed. Essential information from each study ( number of samples , antibody used , collection dates , overall p16 immunohistochemistry results , and general method of interpretation) was tabulated and analyzed. Examples of representative cases showing p16 immunostaining pattern are also illustrated.- Incorporation of p16 immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions<symptom> is of limited use , especially for the purpose of differentiating benign from malignant lesions<symptom>. Evaluation of multiple studies reveals a wide range of results. However , there appears to be some value for the use of p16 in distinguishing nodal nevi from metastatic melanoma within nodes. The method of interpretation ( nuclear versus cytoplasmic staining) also appears to give differing results , as studies considering only nuclear staining appeared to show more consistent results from study to study.
