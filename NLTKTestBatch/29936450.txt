 A recently developed transdermal fentanyl solution was hypothesized to be effective for non-invasive postoperative analgesia in rats. Thirty-nine male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated once with 0.1 , 0.33 or 1.0 mg/kg transdermal fentanyl solution at the skin of the scruff 1 h prior to subjected to hind-paw surgery , and compared to non-treated animals. All rats were tested for nociceptive response in the electronic von Frey ( EVF) test between 1 and 72 h postoperatively , and assessed daily with regards to facial expression , body<symptom> weight<symptom> changes and welfare score. Fentanyl treatment at all doses significantly reduced nociceptive response in the EVF test throughout the 72 h of experimentation , reduced facial expressions on all days postoperatively , slightly reduced the body<symptom> weight<symptom> and improved postoperative welfare parameters. The present study indicates that transdermal fentanyl solution seems to be an effective , non-invasive and long-lasting analgesic regimen in male rats.
