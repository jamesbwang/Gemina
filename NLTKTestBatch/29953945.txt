 Systemic sclerosis is a progressive inflammatory<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> that is frequently fatal and has limited treatment options. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AHCT) has been evaluated as treatment for this disease<disease> in observational studies , multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials , and meta-analyses. On behalf of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ( ASBMT) , a panel of experts in transplantation and rheumatology was convened to review available evidence and make a recommendation on AHCT as an indication for systemic sclerosis. Three randomized trials have compared the efficacy of AHCT with cyclophosphamide only and all demonstrated benefit for the AHCT arm for their primary endpoint ( improvement in ASSIST , event-free survival in ASTIS trial and change<symptom> in global rank composite score in SCOT trial). AHCT recipients also had better overall survival and a lower rate of disease<disease> progression. These findings have been confirmed in subsequent meta-analyses. Based on this high-quality evidence , the ASBMT recommends systemic sclerosis be considered as `` standard of care '' indication for AHCT. Close collaboration between rheumatologists and transplant clinicians is critical for optimizing patient selection and patient outcomes. Transplant centers in the United States are strongly encouraged to report patient and outcomes data to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research on their patients receiving AHCT for this indication.
