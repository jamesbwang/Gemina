 Eisenmenger syndrome<symptom> represents severe , irreversible , and end-stage pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) associated with congenital heart defects. For long-term outcome optimal right ventricular ( RV) adaptation is crucial with precise assessment of its hypertrophy , dilatation and function. Associations of electrocardiographic ( ECG) and echocardiographic ( ECHO) RV characteristics were analyzed. Included were 52 patients ( 39F/13M) , median age 45 years ( 24-78). Following ECG parameters were analyzed: Butler-Leggett formula ( B-L) , Sokolow-Lyon criterion ( S-L) , QRS duration ( QRS) , maximum spatial QRS vector magnitude ( QRS max); and ECHO parameters: RV diameter ( RVd) , RV wall thickness ( RVAW) , RV/LV function. Following significant ECG-ECHO associations were demonstrated: S-L criterion and B-L formula with RVAW ( p 120 ms only with severely dilated RV ( RVd > 45 mm) , while QRS max 33 mm); A new combined scoring system was introduced. In Eisenmenger syndrome<symptom> RV hypertrophy is compensatory; diagnosis of prognostically unfavorable RV dilatation is therefore important. Combined ECG-ECHO analysis enables more accurate risk stratification. QRS duration > 120 ms seems to be a late marker; QRS max together with ECHO parameters may help to distinguish patients at higher risk for clinical deterioration ( Tab. 3 , Fig. 8 , Ref. 53).
