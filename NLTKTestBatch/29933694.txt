 Radioactive strontium ( Sr) is a common groundwater contaminant at many nuclear sites. Its natural retention<symptom> in groundwater-fed wetlands is an attractive remediation strategy. However , at present , the biogeochemical mechanisms controlling Sr transport at the sediment-water interface are poorly understood. In this field study , Sr fate was investigated in two wetlands with contrasting vegetation and hydrologic regimes. The marsh was an open-water wetland with constant water table and no emergent vegetation. The swamp was vegetated with fluctuating water levels and a thick mat of submerged cattail litter in the water column. High-resolution porewater Sr concentrations and solid-phase sediment Sr species revealed distinct profiles between the two wetlands. The marsh exhibited a strongly reduced environment and sharp concentration peaks at the sediment-water interface. In contrast , the smaller concentration gradients of the swamp resulted in a reduced flux of Sr to the surface water. The organic fraction of the sediment dominated Sr retention<symptom> compared to the inorganic iron and manganese oxides. However , the marsh had a significant fraction of recalcitrant Sr presumably due to its incorporation into sulfur and/or carbonate minerals. These results suggest that vegetated wetlands with fluctuating hydrologic regimes could act as efficient sinks for Sr pollution.
