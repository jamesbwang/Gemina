 To analyze clinical factors that were associated with inadequate pain control in cancer patients with metastatic malignancy and moderate<symptom> to severe baseline pain. We retrospectively analyzed data from 260 advanced cancer patients who admitted to the First Hospital of Jilin University ( Jilin , China) from January 2012-May 2013. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the correlation between pain control and baseline characteristics including , gender , patient age , type of malignancy , presence of bone metastases , pain intensity , pain location , etiology of pain , type of pain , and presence of breakthrough pain. A total of 75.4 % of patients obtained satisfactory pain control ( numerical rating scale â‰¤ 3) in 3 days. Baseline characteristics including gastrointestinal tumors ( P = 0.032) , severe<symptom> pain<symptom> ( P < 0.001) , and frequent breakthrough pain ( P < 0.001) were independent risk factors of poor pain control in the 3-day treatment. These factors were also significantly associated with longer time needed to achieve stable pain control. Of the 185 patients treated with opioids , higher doses of analgesics were used in younger patients ( < 60 years old; P = 0.018) , and in patients with severe<symptom> pain<symptom> ( P < 0.001) , neuropathic pain ( P = 0.002) , and frequent breakthrough pain ( P = 0.015). Factors associated with more difficult pain control include gastrointestinal tumor , severe baseline pain , presence of breakthrough pain , and neuropathic etiology of pain.
