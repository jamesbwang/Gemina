 Determining the population-based scope and stability of eating , activity , and weight-related problems is critical to inform interventions. This study examines: ( 1) the prevalence of eating , activity , and weight-related problems likely to influence health; and ( 2) the trajectories for having at least one of these problems during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Project EAT I-IV ( Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults) collected longitudinal survey data from 858 females and 597 males at four waves , approximately every 5 years , from 1998 to 2016 , during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Analyses were conducted in 2017-2018. Measures included high fast-food intake ( â‰¥ 3 times/week) , low physical activity ( < 150 minutes/week) , unhealthy weight<symptom> control , body dissatisfaction , and obesity status<symptom>. Among females , the prevalence of having at least one eating , activity , or weight-related problems was 78.1 % at Wave 1 ( adolescence) and 82.3 % at Wave 4 ( adulthood); in males , the prevalence was 60.1 % at Wave 1 and 69.2 % at Wave 4. Of all outcomes assessed , unhealthy weight<symptom> control behaviors had the highest prevalence in both genders. The stability of having at least one problem was high; 60.2 % of females and 34.1 % of males had at least one problematic outcome at all four waves. The majority of young people have some type of eating , activity , or weight-related problem at all stages from adolescence to adulthood. Findings indicate a need for wide-reaching interventions that address a broad spectrum of eating , activity , and weight-related problems prior to and throughout this developmental period.
