 Management practices of functional constipation<symptom> are far from satisfactory in developing countries like India; available guidelines do not comprehensively address the problems pertinent to our country. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among selected practising pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists in India , and the respondents agreed on the need for an Indian guideline on the topic. A group of experts were invited to present the published literature under 12 different headings , and a consensus was developed to formulate the practice guidelines , keeping in view the needs in Indian children. To formulate practice guidelines for the management of childhood functional constipation<symptom> that is simple and relevant to Indian children. Functional constipation<symptom> should be diagnosed only in the absence of red flags on history and examination. Those with impaction and/or retentive incontinence should be disimpacted with polyethylene glycol ( hospital or home-based). Osmotic laxatives ( polyethylene glycol more than 1 year of age and lactulose/lactitol less than 1 year of age) are the first line of maintenance therapy. Stimulant laxatives should be reserved only for rescue therapy. Combination therapies of two osmotics , two stimulants or two classes of laxatives are not recommended. Laxatives as maintenance therapy should be given for a prolonged period and should be tapered off gradually , only after a successful outcome. Essential components of therapy for a successful outcome include counselling , dietary changes , toilet-training and regular follow-up.
