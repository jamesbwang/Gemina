 We investigated whether subtypes of Alzheimer 's disease<disease> ( AD) , that is , typical , limbic-predominant , hippocampal-sparing , and minimal atrophy AD , had a specific signature of small vessel disease<disease> and neurodegeneration. Four hundred twenty-three clinically diagnosed AD patients were included ( 161 typical , 121 limbic-predominant , 70 hippocampal-sparing , 71 minimal atrophy). One hundred fifty-six fulfilled a biomarkers-based AD diagnosis. White<symptom> matter hyperintensities and cerebral microbleeds ( CMB) had the highest prevalence in limbic-predominant AD , and the lowest prevalence in minimal atrophy AD. CMB existed evenly in lobar and deep brain areas in limbic-predominant , typical , and hippocampal-sparing AD. In minimal atrophy AD , CMB were mainly located in brain lobar areas. Perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale were more prevalent in typical AD. Small vessel disease<disease> contributed to the prediction of Mini-Mental State Examination. Minimal atrophy AD showed highly pathological levels of cerebrospinal fluid AÃŸ
