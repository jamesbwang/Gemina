 Brugada syndrome<symptom> ( BrS) is a well-known catastrophic disease<disease> first reported in 1992 by the Brugada brothers. Ventricular fibrillation ( VF) is an essential arrhythmia in BrS. An association between BrS and atrial tachyarrhythmias is not uncommon. However , sinus node dysfunction ( SND) associated with BrS has not been well discussed. In this review , we focus on the association between BrS and SND. Based on previous reports describing clinical , epidemiological , and genetic evidence , SND is not a rare concomitant disorder in BrS. BrS may be a multiple conduction or arrhythmogenic disorder including not only the His-Purkinje system and right ventricle , but also the sinus node and atrium , derived from ion channel mutations.
