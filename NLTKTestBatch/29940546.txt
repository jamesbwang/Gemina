 IgG4-related disease<disease> ( IgG4-RD) is a recently described systemic entity of unknown origin. It predominantly affects older men and has distinctive histopathologic features as storiform fibrosis<disease> , obliterative phlebitis , dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with immunostaining for IgG4 , and it may be associated with elevated serum levels of IgG4. Although any organ can be affected , pituitary gland is rarely involved. We describe the case of a 36-year-old man who presented with headaches<symptom> , impaired<symptom> vision<symptom> , panhypopituitarism with diabetes insipidus and an infiltrative lesion<symptom> mainly of infundibulum and pituitary. We arrived at diagnosis of IgG4-RD by pituitary biopsy. A successful response to treatment with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids was achieved.
