 A simple method to rapidly customize and to also mass produce oral dosage forms is arguably a current bottleneck in the development of modern personalized medicine. Specifically , delayed-release mechanisms with well-controlled dosage profiles for combinations of traditional Chinese herbal extracts and Western medications are not well established. Herein , we demonstrate a novel multi-drug loaded membrane sandwich with structures infused with ibuprofen ( IBU) and ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide ( GLP) using electrohydrodynamic ( EHD) 3D printing and electrospinning techniques. The resulting flexible membrane consists of micro-scaled , multi-layered cellulose acetate ( CA) membranes<symptom> loaded with IBU in either the shape of concentric squares or circles , as the top and bottom layer of a sandwich structure. In between the CA-IBU layers are randomly electrospun ( ES) polyvinyl pyrrolidone ( PVP) layers loaded with GLP. The complete fibrous membrane sandwich can be folded and embedded into a 0-size capsule to achieve oral compliance. Simulated in vitro testing of gastric and intestinal fluids demonstrated a triphasic release profile. There was an immediate release of GLP after gastric juices dissolved the capsule shell and the PVP , followed by the short-term release of 60 % of the IBU within an hour afterwards , and the remaining IBU was sustained released following a Fickian diffusion profile. In summary , this multi-drug ( both hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic) oral system with precision-designed structures should enable personalized therapeutic dosing.
