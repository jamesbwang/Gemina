 To assess the usefulness of simple axial bi-dimensional diameters of pericardial fat tissues at low-dose chest CT , in correlation with metabolic parameters in predicting metabolic syndrome<symptom>. Subjects were 373 asymptomatic individuals who performed both low-dose chest CT and abdominal fat CT for medical check-up. Maximum bi-dimensional axial diameters of paracardial fats at right<symptom> ( RPF) and left ( LPF) cardiophrenic angle portions , and epicardial fats around right<symptom> ( REF) and left ( LEF) coronary arteries , and coronary sinus ( SEF) were measured. Correlation between pericardial fat diameters and metabolic parameters were statistically analyzed. RPF , LPF , REF , LEF , and SEF diameters were moderately correlated with abdominal visceral fat ( AVF) area ( R = 0.74 , 0.70 , 0.48 , 0.41 , and 0.53 , respectively , p < 0.01) in Pearson 's correlation analysis. In multiple linear regression analysis , coefficient of RPF for AVF showed highest value. Means of each PF and EF diameters in subjects with metabolic syndrome<symptom> were significantly larger than those without metabolic syndrome<symptom> ( p < 0.001). All PF and EF diameters were well-discriminated for prediction of metabolic syndrome<symptom> in ROC analysis ( AUC values , from 0.696 to 0.795). RPF diameter at low-dose chest CT would be a simple method for prediction of metabolic syndrome<symptom>.
