 To describe with multimodal imaging a case of post-infectious unilateral outer retinopathy with choroiditis. Retrospective chart review of a case of a 67-year old male who presented following the onset of viral symptoms<symptom> with an acute onset outer retinopathy , small vessel leakage on fluorescein angiography , and choroidal involvement evident on indocyanine green angiography and near infrared fundus autofluorescence ( NIR-AF). Work up for infectious and autoimmune etiologies was negative. Treatment with IV methylprednisolone followed by high dose oral prednisone resulted in improvement in visual acuity , outer retinal reconstitution and resolution of the choroidal changes. Despite this presentation sharing features with both acute zonal occult outer retinopathy ( AZOOR) and multifocal choroiditis ( MFC) , the case is highly atypical of both entities.
