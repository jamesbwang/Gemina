 Hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system may play an important role in primary premature ejaculation ( PPE) , and dapoxetine , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , plays a role in its treatment. We evaluated the success of dapoxetine treatment in PPE patients with a penile sympathetic skin<symptom> response<symptom> ( PSSR). Of 63 patients who were admitted to our outpatient clinic between March 2017 and December 2017 with a complaint of premature ejaculation and diagnosed with PPE , 56 completed treatment ( minimum 12 tablets) with on-demand use 30 mg of dapoxetine and returned for a follow-up appointment. Before and after treatment , the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF-5) and Arabic index PE ( AIPE) scores , intravaginal ejaculation latency time ( IELT) , testosterone values and PSSR values were compared. The IELT and AIPE values increased significantly in the 56 patients who were re-evaluated after dapoxetine treatment. No significant changes were observed in testosterone levels and IIEF-5. In the PSSR measurement , while the amplitude decreased , the latency was prolonged significantly. PSSR may be an important determinant in the measurement of dapoxetine treatment success for PPE patients , but additional studies are needed.
