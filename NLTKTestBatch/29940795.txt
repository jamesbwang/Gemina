 Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus is a diagnostic challenge due to the multifarious neurological and psychiatric manifestations that define it but , when suspected , diagnostic imaging can give a fundamental help. The advancements and variety of neuroimaging techniques allow us to perform more and more accurate evaluations of structure , perfusion , and metabolism of the brain and to detect cerebral and spinal lesions<symptom>. Moreover , vascular districts of the neck and the brain , as well as the electrical brain and peripheral<symptom> muscle activity may be accurately investigated , thus giving us a wide panoramic view. Although magnetic resonance is recognized as a fundamental neuroimaging technique to reach a correct diagnosis , the juxtaposition of other diagnostic techniques has improved the possibility to make diagnoses but has also increased the confusion<symptom> about deciding which of them to use and when. Our aim was to combine the number of available techniques with the need to simplify the diagnostic path. Therefore , through the construction of an algorithm from an evidence based approach , we believe we are providing some added improvements to facilitate and expedite the diagnosis of NPSLE.
