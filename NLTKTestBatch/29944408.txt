 The connectedness in Arctic regions between migratory waterbird populations originating from different continents and the potential for virus<pathogen> exchange at their shared Arctic breeding ground point to the need to explore the largely unstudied circumpolar circulation of avian influenza<disease> viruses<pathogen> ( AIV). We here report the investigation of AIV in wild birds and lakes in a high Arctic area of Northeast Greenland. No AIV could be detected in the fecal , feather<symptom> , and water samples collected from large flocks of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus and barnacle geese Branta leucopsis in and around refuge lakes , where they congregate at high density during their flightless molting period in summer.
