 The Broadening Experiences in Scientific Experiences ( BEST) program at Wayne State University was designed to increase doctoral students ' awareness of multiple employment sectors beyond academia , improve their knowledge of transferable skills required to succeed in any career path , provide opportunities to explore diverse career paths , and gain in-depth knowledge about those paths using experiential learning opportunities. We devised a three-phase program that ranged from providing students with a broad introduction to multiple career opportunities to immersive experiential learning in a specific career sector. Importantly , program content was developed and delivered by alumni and industry experts in five employment sectors-business/industry , communication , government , law/regulatory affairs , and undergraduate/PUI teaching-in partnership with WSU faculty. This article provides data on two notable outcomes: doctoral students participate equally in BEST activities regardless of gender , race , and citizenship status<symptom> , and student participation in BEST activities did not correlate with lower GRE ratings , lower GPA , or increased time-to-degree. Further , a `` halo '' effect of the program is evidenced by participation of students from all disciplines , not just the biomedical sciences. Centralizing BEST activities within the Graduate School will allow faculty and individual programs to save resources and time.
