 Low-temperature atmospheric-pressure air plasma is a source of charged and neutral gas species. In this study , N-carrying tobacco plants were inoculated with plasma irradiated and non-irradiated tobacco mosaic virus<pathogen> ( TMV) solution , resulting in necrotic local lesions<symptom> on non-irradiated , but not on irradiated , TMV-inoculated leaves. Virus<pathogen> particles were disrupted by plasma irradiation in an exposure-dependent manner , but the viral coat protein subunit was not. TMV RNA was also fragmented in a time-dependent manner. These results indicate that plasma irradiation of TMV can collapse viral particles to the subunit level , degrading TMV RNA and thereby leading to a loss of infectivity.
