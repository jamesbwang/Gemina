 Recent reports suggest that rehabilitation measures that increase physical activity of patients can improve functional outcome following incomplete spinal<disease> cord injuries ( iSCI). To investigate the structural basis of exercise-induced recovery we examined local and remote consequences of voluntary wheel training in spinal<disease> cord injured female mice. In particular , we explored how enhanced voluntary exercise influences the neuronal and glial response at the lesion<symptom> site as well as the rewiring of supraspinal tracts<symptom> after incomplete spinal<disease> cord injury ( iSCI). We chose voluntary exercise initiated by providing mice with free access to running wheels over `` forced overuse '' paradigms as the latter , at least in some cases can lead to worsening of functional outcomes following spinal<disease> cord injury. Our results show that mice extensively use their running wheels not only before but also after injury reaching their pre-lesion exercise levels within 5 days after injury. Enhanced voluntary exercise improved their overall and skilled motor function after injury. In addition , exercising mice started to recover earlier and reached better sustained performance levels. These improvements in motor performance are accompanied by early changes of axonal and glial response at the lesion<symptom> site and sustained enhancements of the rewiring of supraspinal connections that resulted in a strengthening of both indirect and direct inputs to lumbar motoneurons.
