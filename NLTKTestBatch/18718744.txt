 Epicardial adipose tissue thickness ( EATT) measured by echocardiography is a reliable indicator of visceral adipose tissue in the body and metabolic syndrome<symptom>. The objective of this work was to study the effect of 12-week aerobic exercise training on echocardiographic epicardial adipose tissue thickness ( EEATT) , body composition and other metabolic parameters in asymptomatic overweight adults. A total of 170 overweight and mild obese individuals were randomly allocated to 12-week aerobic exercise program ( intervention group) or no supervised exercise ( control group). The body fat percentage and visceral fat levels were measured by bioelectric impedance analyzer , and blood tests were conducted to measure lipids , fasting blood sugar ( FBS) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( Hs-CRP). The participants also underwent transthoracic echocardiography to measure EATT. All the outcomes were measured after 12 weeks. Repeated measures were analyzed using ANOVA and Mann-Whitney EEATT values significantly reduced by -16.24 % ( 3.12 ± 1.18 to 2.70 ± 1.04 , The 12-week aerobic exercise was found to be effective in reducing EEATT in overweight and mild obese individuals. There was significant improvement in body composition , blood lipids , FBS , Hs-CRP and exercise capacity in intervention group compared to control group.
