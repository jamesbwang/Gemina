 Previous research has shown that child-oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD) and conduct disorders ( CD) are associated with parental symptoms<symptom> of depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and/or stress , probably in a bidirectional relationship with mutual influences. It is , therefore , reasonable to assume that in child-centered treatment , a decrease in child-oppositional behavior problems constitutes ( at least in part) a mechanism of change for a subsequent reduction in parental psychopathology. The aim of the present study ( Clinical trials.gov Identifier: NCT01406067) was to examine whether the reduction in ODD symptoms<symptom> due to child-based cognitive behavioral treatment ( CBT) led to a reduction in parental depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and stress. Eighty-one boys ( age 6-12 years) with a diagnosis of ODD/CD were randomized either to a cognitive behavioral intervention group or an educational play group ( acting as control group). Mediation analyses were conducted using path analysis. The stronger reduction in child ODD symptoms<symptom> in the CBT group compared to the control group led to a decrease in parental depression<symptom> and stress , as indicated by significant indirect effects ( ab = 0.07 and ab = 0.08 , p < 0.05). The proposed model for mechanisms of change was , therefore , confirmed for two of the three outcome parameters. Parental psychopathology and stress can be modified by child-centered CBT. The preceding reduction in ODD symptoms<symptom> acts as a mediator for at least some of the changes in parental depression<symptom> and stress. However , due to some limitations of the study , other possible explanations for the results found can not be completely ruled out and are , therefore , discussed.
