 The aim is to develop novel synergistic transparent k-Carrageenan/Xanthan gum/Gellan gum ( k-C/X/G) hydrogel films with different weight<symptom> ratio composition and to study the effect of these compositions on the physical properties of the films. The structure and morphological properties of the films were investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD) and differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC). Results for FT-IR , DSC and SEM analysis showed a clear interaction between k-C , X , and G to form a new material. The mechanical , thermal and water barrier properties such as water vapor permeability ( WVP) , water contact angle ( WCA) and moisture content were determined. The temperature at 5 % weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( T
