 Symptoms<symptom> of genitourinary syndrome<symptom> of menopause ( GSM) are bothersome to middle-aged and older women , and affect their quality of life ( QoL) , sexuality , and daily activities. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of vaginal symptoms<symptom> and GSM on the well-being , functioning , and QoL of postmenopausal women from Spain. This study involved 423 postmenopausal women participating in the GENISSE study ( a multicenter , cross-sectional , descriptive , observational study) who presented at least 1 vaginal symptom<symptom>. All women completed the `` day-to-day impact of vaginal aging '' ( DIVA) questionnaire. Analysis of total scores and subdomains of the questionnaire were performed in women diagnosed with GSM and those without the condition. In these women , the highest mean scores on the DIVA questionnaire were found in the sexual functioning domain long version ( mean 1.8; SD 1.0) , followed by the sexual functioning domain short version ( mean 1.7; SD 1.1) , self-perception and body image ( mean 1.4; SD 1.1) , activities of daily living ( mean 0.7; SD 0.8) , and emotional well-being ( mean 0.7; SD 0.8) scales. A total of 299 women ( 70.7 %) had vaginal symptoms<symptom> with a diagnosis of GSM , whereas 124 ( 29.3 %) had no GSM diagnosis. Scores on the DIVA questionnaire were significantly higher in women with a diagnosis of GSM than in those without this condition. Vaginal symptoms<symptom> impact the well-being , functioning , and QoL of postmenopausal women , especially sexual function , self-perception , and body image. This impact is significantly higher in women with GSM. Identifying and treating patients affected by vaginal symptoms<symptom> and GSM may be beneficial for improving their QoL.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 ( CCBY) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0.
