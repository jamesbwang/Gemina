 Spinal overload among blue-collar workers occurs most frequently in the lumbar spine. Long-lasting spinal overload results in pain syndromes<symptom> leading to limitations in everyday and professional life. The research included 106 adult males working as farmers for at least 10 years. The control group included 50 male white-collar workers. Four research tools were used: an interview questionnaire , a questionnaire assessing pain intensity and limitations in everyday functioning of study participants , a Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS) measuring pain intensity and Oswestry Disability Index. The research revealed that as many as 86 % of the farmers ( 91 individuals) experienced low back<symptom> pain<symptom>. In the control group only 64 % of all the white-collar workers complained of pain in this part of the spine. The farmers defined their low<symptom> back<symptom> pain<symptom> as constant pain or stiffness significantly more often. In addition , they reported hip<symptom> pain<symptom> radiating to one or 2 legs and experienced chronic and acute back<symptom> pain<symptom> more frequently. The total time in which they experienced this pain was usually 11-20 years. The correlation between pain intensity measured on a numeric scale and the level of disability of farmers was revealed. The research revealed that individual farmers complained of low back<symptom> pain<symptom> significantly more often. The pain was usually defined as constant pain , chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , acute<symptom> pain<symptom> or hip<symptom> pain<symptom> radiating to legs. Med Pr 2018; 69 ( 4).
