 Although immigrants to the United States earn less at entry than their native-born counterparts , an extensive literature has found that immigrants have faster earnings growth that results in rapid convergence to native-born earnings. However , recent evidence based on U.S. Census data indicates a slowdown in the rate of earnings assimilation. We find that the pace of immigrant wage convergence based on recent data may be understated in the literature as a result of the method used by the census to impute missing information on earnings , which does not use immigration status<symptom> as a match characteristic. Because both the share of immigrants in the workforce and earnings imputation rates have risen over time , imputation match bias for recent immigrants is more consequential than in earlier periods and may lead to an underestimate of the rate of immigrant wage convergence.
