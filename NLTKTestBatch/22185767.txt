 Rabies<pathogen> is an almost invariably fatal Lyssavirus-induced disease<disease> , that causes acute encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> in humans and other mammals. The viral reservoirs include both wild and domestic animals. The infection causes about 24000 to 60000 deaths worldwide per year ( Giesen et al. , 2015; Naghavi et al. , 2015) with Africa and Asia having the majority of human deaths ( 95 %) caused by rabies<pathogen>. Rabies<pathogen> is endemic in animals in Arabian peninsula. Some countries in the region such as Saudi Arabia , Yemen and Oman are reporting increasing number of cases of wildlife rabies<pathogen>. Among these countries Saudi Arabia is largest , but published data regarding the rabies<pathogen> status in the country are scarce. We report a case of a 60 year old Saudi man who was admitted to cardiac ICU of a tertiary care hospital in Makkah , primarily with history of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> for cardiac evaluation , who was found to have signs suggestive hydrophobia. On history , it was found that he had an unprovoked scratch on his face by a dog in Morocco a month prior to admission and his saliva PCR test confirmed rabies<pathogen> virus<pathogen>.
