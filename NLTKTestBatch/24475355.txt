 In children , urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( UTI) is one of a common bacterial infection. This study was conducted to detect the uropathogen , antimicrobial susceptibility , pathogen associated with recurrences and renal scarring in children initially taken care from general practitioners and later presented to tertiary care. Every inward UTI episode , culture and antimicrobial susceptibility was done while on past 6-month , history of infections and use of antimicrobials was collected using clinical records and demonstration of antimicrobials. Children with recurrent pyelonephritis<disease> was followed and in vitro bio film formation was assessed. Frequency of UTI was significantly high among infants ( p = 0.03). Last 6-month , all ( 220) were exposed to antimicrobials. Cefixime was the commonly prescribed antimicrobial ( p = 0.02). In current UTI episode , 64.5 % ( 142/220) of children with UTI were consulted GPs ' prior to seek treatment from tertiary care pediatric unit ( p = 0.02). While on follow up child who developed UTI , found urine culture isolates were significantly shifted from E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom> to extended spectrum of beta-lactamase ( ESBL) E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom>. Out of 208 participants , 36 of them had re-current pyelonephritis<disease> ( R-PN). Renal scarring ( RS) was detected in 22 out of 70 patients with pyelonephritis<disease> following dimercaptosuccinic acid scan. Following each episodes of recurrent pyelonephritis<disease> 11 % of new scar formation was detected ( p = 0.02). Bio film forming E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom> was significantly associated in patients with R-PN ( p = 0.04). Medical care providers often prescribe antimicrobials without having an etiological diagnosis. While continuing exposure of third generation cephalosporin and carbapenem leads to development of ESBL and CRE microbes in great. The empiric uses of antimicrobials need to be stream lined with local epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. R-PN in childhood leads to RS. In great , bio film formation act as the focus for such recurrences.
