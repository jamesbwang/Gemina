 Haemodynamic follow up in pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) is currently based on right heart catheterisation ( RHC). The primary objective of the EVITA study is to compare the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( cMRI) with RHC in the identification of an unfavourable hemodynamic status<symptom>. The secondary objectives are to determine the role of cMRI in the follow up process. Patients will undergo at diagnosis and at follow up visits both RHC and cMRI. Patients will be followed and treated according to the current guidelines. The primary endpoint will be an unfavourable haemodynamic status<symptom> defined by cardiac index < 2.5 L/min/m
