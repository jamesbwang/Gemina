 To explore the associations between stress , sleep disturbances , fatigue<symptom> severity and social support among primary family caregivers in intensive care units during the early period of ICU hospitalisation. Cross-sectional , descriptive correlational study. Intensive Care Units in a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Perceived stress ( Impact of Events Scale-Revised) , sleep disturbances ( General Sleep Disturbance Scale) , fatigue<symptom> severity ( Lee 's Fatigue<symptom> Scale) , social support ( Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire) and one open-ended question. The primary family caregivers ( N = 87) were distressed and experienced poor sleep quality and fatigue<symptom> during the early period of ICU hospitalisation. Primary family caregivers have various social support needs but being updated on the patients ' prognosis was at the top of the list. Perceived ICU hospitalisation stress was the only significant predictor for fatigue<symptom> while age along with perceived event stress were the significant predictors for sleep disturbances. Stress-coping interventions are needed to reduce stress-related symptoms<symptom> for the primary family caregivers. Social supports did not buffer stress in this study , which calls for further research to explore the culture variance and quality of social support.
