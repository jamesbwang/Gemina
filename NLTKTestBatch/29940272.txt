 The bird mitogenome is generally considered to have a conservative genome size , consistent gene content , and similar gene order. As more mitogenomes are sequenced , mitochondrial ( mt) gene rearrangements have been frequently identified among diverse birds. Within two genera ( Bubo<symptom> and Strix) of typical owls ( Strigidae , Strigiformes) , the rearrangement of the mt gene has been a subject of debate. In the current study , we first sequenced the whole mitogenomes of S. uralensis and B. scandiaca and resequenced the entire mitogenome of B. bubo<symptom>. By combining our data with previously sequenced mitogenomes in Strigidae , we examined the mt gene rearrangements in the family and attempted to reconstruct the evolutionary progression of these rearrangements. The mitogenomes were then used to review the phylogenies of Strigidae. Most mitogenomes exhibited the ancestral gene order ( A) in Strigidae. The ancestral gene order in the previously published mitogenome of B. bubo<symptom> was found to be incorrect. We determined the mt gene order ( the duplicate tRNA
