 We aim to evaluate changes in the ocular surface in a cohort of post-trabeculectomy patients and whether these were associated with conjunctival inflammatory gene expression. This is a single-arm interventional cohort performed in a tertiary referral center. These were assessed: dry<symptom> eye symptom<symptom> questionnaire , tear osmolarity , Schirmer 's test , non-invasive tear break up time ( BUT) , conjunctival redness and corneal fluorescein staining evaluation. Conjunctival impressions were performed using Eyeprim , and after RNA extraction , transcripts of 255 inflammatory genes were analysed using the Nanostring nCounter assay. Thirty three patients were recruited with age 66.88 Â± 9.76 at baseline , with a predominance of men. There was a significant decrease in inferior corneal staining at 6 months ( p < 0.05) ( n = 22) and significant decrease in tear osmolarity at 12 months ( p < 0.01) ( n = 27). No patient required glaucoma eyedrops post-surgery up to 3 years. At baseline 31/33 transcript profiles passed the quality control , and after normalization , 249 transcripts were subsequently analysed. Increased discomfort was associated with higher Protein Tyrosine Kinase-2 at the cross-sectional analysis at baseline. Lower baseline complement factor-D and higher levels of Mitogen associated kinase-8 , MAP3K1 and MyD88 , were associated with presence of corneal staining at 6 months. Nine genes , including the proinflammatory lipo-oxygenase ( ALOX5) showed a significantly reduced level at 3 years ( n = 5). Glaucoma surgery may confer long term beneficial effect on the ocular surface , if anti-glaucoma eyedrops are no longer necessary. This may be due to reduced expression of conjunctival proinflammatory genes and immune-related genes.
