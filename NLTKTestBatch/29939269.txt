 A two-part experiment was conducted to determine the effects of a blend of specialized mannan rich and glucan rich fractions of yeast ( Select-TC , Alltech Inc.) on the health status<symptom> and performance of steers during the first two months of the feedlot period. Eighty crossbred steers were acquired from commercial sale barns in Mississippi and Georgia , and transported to Purdue University. All animals were fed a corn silage based receiving diet , and were checked and treated daily for respiratory<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> as needed following established treatment protocols. In Exp. 1 , 64 steers ( 246.5 ± 4.7 kg initial weight<symptom>) were blocked by body<symptom> weight<symptom> ( BW) and randomly allocated to 2 treatments to determine the impact of supplementation of a hydrolyzed mannan and glucan rich yeast fraction for 56 d on BW , average daily gain ( ADG) , daily dry matter intake ( DMI) , and gain: feed: hydrolyzed yeast fed at 13 g ( as-fed)/ steer daily ( TC) or non-supplemented control ( CON). Steers in Exp. 1 were housed in bedded pens with 2 animals/pen ( n = 16 pens ( 32 steers)/ treatment). In Exp. 2 , 16 steers ( 247.1 ± 5.4 kg initial BW) were similarly allotted to two treatments ( CON and TC) , individually penned , and subjected to a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) endotoxin challenge on d 62 or 63 after the start of the study to determine the animal 's response to an inflammatory agent. Serum samples and rectal temperatures were taken every half an hour from -2 to 8 h relative to LPS injection from steers in Exp. 2. Data were analyzed as a complete randomized block design using the MIXED<disease> procedure of SAS. Morbidity for both experiments did not differ ( P ≥ 0.16). Weight<symptom> , ADG , DMI and gain: feed , did not differ among treatments ( P ≥ 0.32) in Exp. 1. After the LPS infusion in Exp. 2 , rectal temperatures ( P = 0.03) and serum non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFA) concentration ( P = 0.04) were decreased in TC compared to CON steers. Concentrations of blood urea nitrogen ( P = 0.31) , glucose ( P = 0.70) , insulin ( P = 0.57) and cortisol ( P = 0.77) did not differ by treatment after LPS administration. Serum interleukin-6 concentrations were decreased ( P < 0.0001) and interferon-γ concentrations tended to be greater ( P = 0.07) in TC compared to CON steers after LPS infusion. Serum cytokine and metabolite results indicate that Select TC improved health and metabolic status<symptom> of LPS-challenged cattle , but this did not result in quantifiable improvements in performance in the conditions observed in this study.
