 The widespread use of silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) in medicine and in multiple commercial products has motivated researchers to investigate their potentially hazardous effects in organisms. Since AgNPs may easily enter the brain through the blood-brain barrier ( BBB) , characterization of their interactions with cellular components of the neurovascular unit ( NVU) is of particular importance. Therefore , in an animal model of prolonged low-dose exposure , we investigate the extent and mechanisms of influence of AgNPs on cerebral microvessels. Adult rats were treated orally with small ( 10 nm) AgNPs in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg b.w. over a 2-week period. A silver citrate-exposed group was established as a positive control of ionic silver effects. Alterations in the expression of tight junction proteins claudin-5 , ZO-1 , and occludin , were observed. These effects are accompanied by ultrastructural features indicating enhanced permeability of microvessels such as focal edema<symptom> of perivascular astrocytic processes and surrounding neuropil. We did not identify changes in the expression of PDGFÎ²R which is a marker of pericytes. Ultrastructural alterations in these cells were not identified. The results show that altered integrity of cerebral vessels under a low-dose of AgNP-exposure may be the consequence of dysfunction of endothelial cells caused by disruption of tight junction proteins.
