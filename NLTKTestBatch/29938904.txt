 The Penicillin Binding Proteins ( PBPs) are important biological target for new antibacterial drugs development. This study focused on molecular interaction between cefoxitin and the Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom> PBP5 by molecular dynamics ( MD) by using hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics ( QM/MM) simulations approach , searching to develop a computational simulations prototype method on antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria<pathogen> against antibiotics. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom> ATCC 8739 strain susceptibility for the drugs used in the antimicrobial susceptibility testing and selection of bioactive molecules against resistant strain. The protonation revealed a deprotonate state for His146 , His151 , His216 and His320 residues. The complex was stabilized after 0.6 ns of MD simulation. The global interaction means for inhibition zone diameters of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom> ATCC8739 strain and cefoxitin was 24.33 mm no showing significant difference between computational and experimental methods. Our computational simulation method can reliably be performed as a molecular modeling prototype for gram-negative antimicrobial susceptibility testing bacteria<pathogen>.
