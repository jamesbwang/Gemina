 The antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD) is upregulated in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) and has been implicated in multiple stages of RCC tumorigenesis and progression. However , the prognostic significance of MnSOD in RCC has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the expression profile of MnSOD in clear cell RCC ( ccRCC) tissues and evaluate the clinical significance of this enzyme in ccRCC patients. MnSOD mRNA was assessed in 42 ccRCC and 33 normal kidney tissues by the Oncomine database , and its protein was detected in 145 ccRCC and 3 normal tissues by immunohistochemistry staining ( IHC). The Oncomine database confirmed higher MnSOD mRNA expression in ccRCC than in normal tissues , and IHC analysis revealed that MnSOD protein expression was inversely associated with pathologic grade , clinical stage , tumor size , M status<symptom> , and cancer-specific survival. In addition , univariate survival analysis demonstrated that high-grade , late-stage , large tumors , stage M
