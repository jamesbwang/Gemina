 Periodic limb<symptom> movements<symptom> during sleep present with repetitive movements , typically in the lower limbs , during sleep. Periodic limb<symptom> movements<symptom> during sleep have been proposed to be associated with increased risk of heart diseases<disease>. The aim of this study was to examine the co-morbidity rates of heart disease<disease> , including acute myocardial infarction , coronary artery disease<disease> and cardiovascular disease<disease> , in subjects with or without periodic limb<symptom> movements<symptom> during sleep through a meta-analysis. An electronic review of PubMed , Embase , ScienceDirect , Cochrane Library , ProQuest , Web of Science , ClinicalKey and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed. Clinical studies , case-controlled trials and cohort studies were all included in the search. Case reports or series , and non-clinical studies were excluded. A meta-analysis of the results of six studies comparing the prevalence of coronary artery disease/acute myocardial infarction/cardiovascular disease<disease> in subjects with/without periodic limb<symptom> movements<symptom> during sleep was performed. There were significantly higher co-morbidity rates of coronary artery disease<disease> ( odds ratio = 1.568 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.187-2.073 , p = 0.002) and cardiovascular disease<disease> ( odds ratio = 1.279 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.095-1.494 , p = 0.002) , but not acute myocardial infarction ( odds ratio = 1.272 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.942-1.718 , p = 0.117) , in the periodic limb<symptom> movements<symptom> during sleep group than in the non-periodic limb<symptom> movements<symptom> during sleep group. This meta-analysis highlights the importance of a significantly high prevalence of coronary artery disease<disease> and cardiovascular disease<disease> in subjects with periodic limb<symptom> movements<symptom> during sleep. Further studies should be focused on the potential pathophysiology , and whether treatment for periodic limb<symptom> movements<symptom> during sleep can improve the outcome of heart disease<disease>.
