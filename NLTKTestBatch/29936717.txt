 Background: Gastric cancer ( GC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide. Studies have shown that dietary components and inflammation<symptom> are implicated in the etiology of GC. Methods: We examined the ability of a dietary inflammatory index ( DII) to predict the odds of GC in a casecontrol study conducted from December 2014 to May 2016. The subjects were 82 cases and 95 controls who attended specialized centers in Tabriz , Iran. DII scores were computed from a validated 168-item food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios ( ORs) adjusted for age , sex , body mass index , education , smoking , alcohol , H.pylori infection , physical activity , aspirin/NSAID use and total caloric intake. Results: In the fully adjusted model , subjects with a DII score > -1.77 had nearly 3.5 times higher odds of having GC compared with subjects with DII ≤ -1.77 , ( ORDII > -1.77 ≤ -1.77 = 3.39; 95 % CI = 1.59 , 7.22). Also , for every one-unit increase in DII , there was a corresponding increase in hs-C-reactive protein , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha , interleukin ( IL) -6 and IL-1b: β = 0.09 , 0.16 , 0.16 and 0.10 , respectively; and a corresponding decrease in IL-10: β = -0.11. Conclusion: Subjects who consumed a more pro-inflammatory diet were at increased odds of GC compared to those who consumed a more anti-inflammatory diet.
