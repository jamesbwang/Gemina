 Trace minerals are vital in the antioxidant response during oxidative stress; however , limited research is available on the effects of trace mineral supplementation during an aflatoxin ( AF) challenge. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of 2 subcutaneous injections of 15 mg/mL of Cu , 5 mg/mL of Se , 60 mg/mL of Zn , and 10 mg/mL of Mn ( Multimin 90 , Multimin North America , Fort Collins , CO) given at 1 mL/90 .7 kg of average body<symptom> weight<symptom> in response to an AF challenge. Fifty-eight Holstein cows ( body<symptom> weight<symptom> ( mean ± SD) = 734 ± 6 0 kg; days in milk = 191 ± 93) were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments in a randomized complete block design. The experimental period ( 63 d) was divided into an adaptation phase ( d 1-56) and a measurement phase ( d 57-63). From d 57 to 59 , cows received an AF challenge that consisted of 100 μg of aflatoxin B
