 Considered as the precursor lesion<symptom> of a subset of ovarian clear cell carcinoma ( OCCC) , the prognostic role of endometriosis in OCCC patients remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic role of coexisting endometriosis in the survival of patients with OCCC , and also sought to identify other prognostic factors. A total of 125 patients were diagnosed with OCCC during the study period. Of these , 55 ( 44.0 %) patients had coexisting endometriosis. Patients with endometriosis were younger ( p = 0.030) , had smaller tumor diameter ( p = 0.005) and lower preoperative CA125 levels ( p = 0.005). More patients with endometriosis had International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics ( FIGO) stage I disease<disease> ( 83.6 % vs. 51.4 % , p = 0.000) and exhibited sensitivity to platinum-based regimen ( 89.6 % vs. 66.7 % , p = 0.003). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that coexisting endometriosis was not a predictor of 5-year overall survival ( OS) or progression-free survival ( PFS) of OCCC patients. For OS , chemosensitivity was the only useful prognostic factor ( Hazards ratio ( HR) 109.33 , 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI) 23.46-511.51; p = 0.000). For PFS , the useful prognostic factors were ascites ( HR 2.78 , 95 % CI 1.21-6.47; p = 0.016) , FIGO stage ( HR 1.61 , 95 % CI 1.04-2.49; p = 0.033) , and chemosensitivity ( HR 101.60 , 95 % CI 29.45-350.49; p = 0.000). Moreover , higher FIGO stage was the only risk factor for resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy ( Exp ( B) = 0.292 , 95 % CI 0.123-0.693; p = 0.005). In this study , coexisting endometriosis was not a prognostic factor for the survival of OCCC patients. The most important predictor of both 5-year OS and PFS was chemosensitivity to platinum-based regimen , which decreased significantly with increase in FIGO stage.
