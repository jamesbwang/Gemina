 Up to 40 % of patients with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed , usually with major depression<symptom> disorder. The purpose was to describe the current state of the science of the misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder , with the ultimate goal of improving psychiatric diagnostic workups including screening. An integrative review was conducted using standard criteria for evaluating research articles. Forty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Articles explored patient-related and health care provider-related factors contributing to the misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder as well as consequences of misdiagnosis. Clinically oriented , reliable , and valid screening tools for bipolar disorder also were reviewed. Awareness of multiple , challenging patient-related factors and more comprehensive assessment and screening by health care providers may reduce misdiagnosis.
