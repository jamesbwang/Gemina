 To explore qualitative insights into the pain experience of older women with quantitatively derived pain profiles. The sequential mixed methods design involved applying quantitative pain profiles , derived from an earlier latent class analysis , to qualitative comments by a sample of older Australian women with arthritis<disease>. Data from a substudy of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 's Health , mid-aged cohort , born 1946-1951 , were used. Inductive content analysis was conducted to explore qualitative insights into the experience of pain. The average age of women was 64.6 years ( Â± 1.4). Within each derived pain profile , themes generated from the qualitative comments of women were concordant with the profile descriptors: ` I manage my pain ' for the uni-dimensional , mild<symptom> pain<symptom> profile ( comments from 56 women); ` I live with pain every day ' and ` I rely on medication regularly ' for the moderate multidimensional pain profile ( comments from 39 women); and ` multiple<symptom> pains<symptom> ' , ` I suffer with pain ' and ` I am unable and adjust ' for the severe multidimensional pain profile ( comments from 31 women). Women with different pain profiles used different language and strategies in managing their pain experience , information which can guide clinicians to provide more tailored support for self-management and care of arthritis<disease> pain<symptom>.
