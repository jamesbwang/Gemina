 Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS) is a disease<disease> of widespread prevalence and high morbidity. Many suggest that the introduction of toxins and allergens via nasal airflow plays a significant role in the development of CRS. In patients who have undergone total laryngectomy , nasal airflow is disrupted , providing an opportunity to examine the role of nasal airflow in sinonasal pathology. All patients who received a total laryngectomy between 2002 and 2012 with preoperative and postoperative computed tomography ( CT) scans were retrospectively reviewed. The Lund-Mackay ( LM) score for each sinus was recorded for both scans. The assessment of differences in pre-operative and post-operative LM scores was analyzed utilizing paired t-tests. 56 patients underwent total laryngectomy and had both preoperative and postoperative CT scans. There were no significant differences in the LM scores between pre-operative and post-operative scans within each sinus ( frontal sinus , p = 1.0; anterior ethmoid sinus , p = 0.77; posterior ethmoid sinus , p = 0.45; maxillary sinus , p = 0.90; sphenoid sinus , p = 0.63; ostiomeatal complex , p = 0.78) or in the total LM scores ( p = 0.97). Furthermore , patients with pre-operative sinonasal mucosal thickening ( total LM score > 0) showed no significant change in their total LM score post-operatively ( p = 0.13). In total laryngectomy patients , studies demonstrate that a disruption in nasal airflow is correlated to altered sinonasal physiology and decreased subjective symptoms<symptom>. However , our study shows that the disruption of nasal airflow results in no significant change in radiographic evidence of sinonasal mucosal thickening.
