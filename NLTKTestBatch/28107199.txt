 The incidence of thyroid nodules<disease> has increased worldwide in recent years. Thyroid dysfunction is a potential risk factor for hypercholesterolemia , cardiovascular disease<disease> , osteoporosis , arrhythmia , and neuropsychiatric disease<disease>. This study investigated the prevalence and annual incidence of thyroid nodules<disease> , hypothyroidism , and hyperthyroidism in Koreans. In this nationwide population-based cohort study , 51,834,660 subjects were included using the National Health Information database from 2006 to 2015 , after the exclusion of subjects with thyroid cancer. The prevalence in Korea in 2015 of thyroid nodules<disease> , hypothyroidism in patients taking thyroid hormone , and hyperthyroidism in patients undergoing treatment was 15.82/ 1,000 population , 15.94/ 1,000 population , and 2.76/ 1,000 population , respectively. All these diseases<disease> were more prevalent among women than among men. The number of incident cases of these three thyroid diseases<disease> steadily increased from 2006 to 2012 , and then decreased through 2015. The incidence of thyroid nodules<disease> , hypothyroidism treated with thyroid hormone , and treated hyperthyroidism was 6.79/ 1,000 population , 1.76/ 1,000 population , and 0.55/ 1,000 population , respectively , in Korea in 2015. The use of methimazole continuously increased , from 33 % of total antithyroid drug prescriptions in 2006 to 74.4 % in 2015 , and it became the most frequently prescribed antithyroid drug in Korea. In contrast , the use of propylthiouracil continuously decreased. This was the first nationwide study of the prevalence and annual incidence of thyroid nodules<disease> , hypothyroidism , and hyperthyroidism to take into account recent changes and to include the current status<symptom> of patients receiving treatment.
