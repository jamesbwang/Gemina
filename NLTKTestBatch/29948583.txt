 In spite of several proposed predictors for premature ventricular complex ( PVC)- induced cardiomyopathy ( PVC-CMP) , the specific ECG features of idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract<symptom> ( RVOT) PVC-CMP remain unknown. A total of 130 patients ( 49 males , mean age 44 years) with symptomatic and drug-refractory idiopathic RVOT PVCs undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA) were enrolled. The patients were categorized into two groups , including those with and without RVOT PVC-CMP ( left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) < 50 % , n = 25 and LVEF ≥ 50 % , n = 105 , respectively). The 12-lead PVC morphologies were assessed. Patients with RVOT PVC-CMP had a lower LVEF ( 42 ± 5 % vs. 60 ± 7 % , P < 0.01) and higher PVC burden ( 24 ± 14 % vs. 15 ± 11 % , P = 0.02) when compared to patients without RVOT PVC-CMP. The PVC features in those with PVC-CMP displayed a significantly wider QRS duration ( 143 ± 14 ms vs. 132 ± 17 ms , P < 0.01) and higher peak deflection index ( PDI; 0.60 ± 0.07 vs. 0.55 ± 0.08 , P < 0.01). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the QRS duration ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.130 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.020-1.253 , P = 0.02) and PDI ( OR 1.240 , 95 % CI 1.004-1.532 , P = 0.04) were independently associated with RVOT PVC-CMP. Based on the receiver-operating characteristic analysis , a QRS duration > 139 ms and PDI > 0.57 could predict RVOT PVC-CMP ( area under the curve ( AUC) 0.710 and AUC 0.690 , respectively). The elimination and suppression of PVCs by RFCA resulted in the recovery of the LVEF in RVOT PVC-CMP. The ECG parameters , including a wider QRS duration and higher PDI , could predict the development of RVOT PVC-CMP , which could be effectively treated by RFCA.
