 This paper proposes a reliable and efficient technique to recognize different epilepsy states , including healthy , interictal , and ictal states , using Electroencephalogram ( EEG) signals. The proposed approach consists of pre-processing , feature extraction by higher order spectra , feature normalization , feature selection by genetic algorithm and ranking method , and classification by support vector machine with Gaussian and polynomial radial basis function kernels. The proposed approach is validated on a public benchmark dataset to compare it with previous studies. The results indicate that the combined use of above elements can effectively decipher the cognitive process of epilepsy and seizure<symptom> recognition. There are several bispectrum and bicoherence peaks at every bi-frequency plane , which reveal the location of the quadratic phase coupling. The proposed approach can reach , in almost all of the experiments , up to 100 % performance in terms of sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy. Comparing between the obtained results and previous approaches approves the effectiveness of the proposed approach for seizure<symptom> and epilepsy recognition.
