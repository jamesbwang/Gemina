 We previously showed that knockdown of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2) resulted in suppression of hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection. In this study , whether brusatol , an Nrf2 inhibitor , has dual anti-HCV and anticancer effects was explored. The anti-HCV effect of brusatol was investigated by analyzing HCV<pathogen> RNA and proteins in a hepatic cell line persistently-infected with HCV<pathogen> , HPI cells , and by analyzing HCV<pathogen> replication in a replicon-replicating hepatic cell line , OR6 cells. Then , dual anti-HCV and anticancer effects of brusatol and enhancement of the effects by the combination of brusatol with anticancer drugs including sorafenib , which has been reported to have the dual effects , were then investigated. Brusatol suppressed the persistent HCV<pathogen> infection at both the RNA and protein levels in association with a reduction in Nrf2 protein in the HPI cells. Analysis of the OR6 cells treated with brusatol indicated that brusatol inhibited HCV<pathogen> persistence by inhibiting HCV<pathogen> replication. Combination of brusatol with an anticancer drug not only enhanced the anticancer effect but also , in the case of the combination with sorafenib , strongly suppressed HCV<pathogen> infection. Brusatol has dual anti-HCV and anticancer effects and can enhance the comparable effects of sorafenib. There is therefore the potential for combination therapy of brusatol and sorafenib for HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
