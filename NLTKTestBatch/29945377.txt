 In this study , complex enzymes combined with ultrasonic extraction technology （ MC ） were used , to select optimal extraction combinations by single factor and orthogonal test , with Hedysarum polysaccharides yield and content as the comprehensive indexes. The components , physicochemical properties and antioxidant activity of Hedysarum polysaccharides from complex enzyme combined with ultrasonic extraction （ HPS-MC ） and the Hedysarum polysaccharides from hot water extraction （ HPS-R ） were analyzed. The results showed that ： complex enzymes had significant effect on the yield and content of Hedysarum polysaccharides , and the ultrasonic power could significantly improve the content of Hedysarum polysaccharides. The optimum technological parameters were as follows: complex enzyme ratio 1:1 , ultrasonic power 105 W , ultrasonic time 60 min , and enzymatic hydrolysis pH 5 , achieving （ 14.01 ± 0.64 ） % and （ 92.45 ± 1.47 ） % respectively for the yield and content of Polysaccharides. As compared with HPS-R , the molecular weight<symptom> , absolute viscosity and protein content of HPS-MC were decreased , while the content of uronic acid was increased. In the antioxidant system , the concentration of polysaccharide was within the range of 1-7 g · L ⁻¹; the antioxidant activity of HPS-MC was higher than that of HPS-R , and HPS-MC ( 80 %) with the lowest molecular weight<symptom> showed a significant dose effect relationship with the increase of the experimental concentration. In conclusion , MC is a simple , convenient , economical and environmentally friendly extraction technology , and the Hedysarum polysaccharides extracted by this method have obvious antioxidant activity.
