 What is the central question of this study? Does inspiratory resistance breathing improve tolerance to simulated hemorrhage<symptom> in individuals with elevated internal temperatures? What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding of this study is that inspiratory resistance breathing modestly improves tolerance to a simulated progressive hemorrhagic challenge during heat stress. These findings demonstrate a scenario in which exploitation of the respiratory pump can ameliorate serious conditions related to systemic hypotension<symptom>. Heat exposure impairs human blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control and markedly reduces tolerance to a simulated hemorrhagic challenge. Inspiratory resistance breathing enhances blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control and improves tolerance during simulated hemorrhage<symptom> in normothermic individuals. However , it is unknown if similar improvements occur with this maneuver in heat stress conditions. This study tested the hypothesis that inspiratory resistance breathing improves tolerance to simulated hemorrhage<symptom> in individuals with elevated internal temperatures. On 2 separate days , 8 subjects performed a simulated hemorrhage<symptom> challenge ( lower body negative pressure , LBNP) to pre-syncope following an increase in internal temperature of 1.3 ± 0.1 °C. During one trial subjects breathed through an inspiratory impedance device set at 0 cmH
