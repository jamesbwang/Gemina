 The aim of this study was to examine whether ADHD is a dimensional trait in the adult general population. We studied whether an increased number of ADHD symptoms<symptom> was associated with higher comorbidity , exposure to risk factors ( childhood abuse and parental psychopathology) , and disability. We ascertained whether even low numbers of ADHD symptoms<symptom> were associated with an increased burden of disease<disease>. Data were used from the second wave of the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 ( NEMESIS-2 , N = 5303). NEMESIS-2 is a nationally representative face-to-face survey on mental health of the Dutch general population. ADHD symptoms<symptom> , mental comorbidity , and disability were assessed using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Screener , the Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 , and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey , respectively. Dose-response relationships were found between the number of ADHD symptoms<symptom> and Axis I and II mental disorders; exposure to risk factors; and mental and physical disability. Our study supports the notion that ADHD is a dimensional trait in the adult general population. Even low numbers of symptoms<symptom> were associated with an increased burden of disease<disease> , and therefore these should be identified and treated.
