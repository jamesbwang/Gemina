 The purpose of this study was to monitor the association between single umbilical artery ( SUA) , chromosomal abnormalities and associated anomalies during the routine examination of spontaneous or induced miscarriages and premature births<symptom>. During 1992-2015 we morphologically and cytogenetically examined a series of 4098 samples. For 1330 cases the number of umbilical cord vessels could be reported. The presence of single umbilical artery was identified in 67 fetuses of 1330 pregnancies ( 5.04 %); 36 of the 67 fetuses ( 53.7 %) had additional congenital malformations. The cultures were unsuccessful in 29 of 67 cases ( 43.3 %). 38 cases ( 56.7 %) were successfully karyotyped; 20 out of them had a normal karyotype and 18 had chromosomal anomalies including trisomy 18 ( n = 4) , trisomy 13 ( n = 3) , trisomy 21 ( n = 2) , trisomy 11 ( n = 1) , triploidy ( n = 3) , monosomy X ( n = 3) and structural chromosomal aberrations ( n = 2). Isolated SUA is not at increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities and generally does not endanger pregnancy. All chromosomally abnormal embryos and fetuses had associated congenital anomalies. The most frequently associated congenital anomalies were in the musculoskeletal system , central nervous system and genitourinary tract<symptom> ( Tab. 4 , Ref. 44).
