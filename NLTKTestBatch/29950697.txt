 Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus<pathogen> dysgalactiae<pathogen> is a well-known pathogen for a wide range of animals and humans. Two subspecies are recognized: ( i) equisimilis<pathogen> , associated to disease<disease> in horses and humans , and ( ii) dysgalactiae<pathogen> mainly isolated from animal illness with only a few humans ' cases. This study describes the isolation and characterization of Streptococcus<pathogen> dysgalactiae<pathogen> subsp. dysgalactiae<pathogen> ( SDSD) from vampire bats , maintained in captivity for research proposes. Animals presented neurologic , respiratory and gastroenteric symptoms<symptom> and sudden death. Beta-hemolytic Gram-positive cocci were isolated in blood agar plates and further characterized as Lancefield group C. All isolates were identified as S.<pathogen> dysgalactiae<pathogen> by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight ( MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and subspecies dysgalactiae<pathogen> was confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Genotyping through SE-ALFP resulted in three profiles ( A1-A3) with one bat being infected by profiles A1 and A3. This is the first report of SDSD causing illness in bats and especially in Desmodus rotundus species.
