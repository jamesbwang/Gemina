 To explore relationships between balance-confidence and: 1) community participation; 2) self-perceived mobility; and 3) performance-based physical function among individuals with a lower-limb amputation using a prosthetic. Retrospective , cross-sectional study. Outpatient , multidisciplinary amputee clinic. Patients ( n = 45) using a prosthesis , aged ≥ 18 years , with a unilateral transfemoral or transtibial amputation of ≥ 1 year , were included. Participants completed the following self-report measures: Activities-Specific Balance<symptom> Confidence Scale ( ABC); Community Integration Questionnaire ( CIQ); Locomotor Capabilities Index ( LCI); and two performance-based measures ( i.e. Timed Up and Go and 6 Minute Walk Test). Linear regression modeling was used to explore relationships between balance-confidence ( i.e. ABC) and self-report ( i.e. CIQ and LCI) and performance-based measures ( p ≤ 0.0125). After controlling for potential covariates ( i.e. age , sex , and body mass index) , balance-confidence explained 47.4 % of the variance in CIQ ( p = 0.000) , 53.0 % of the variance in LCI ( p = 0.000) , 20.3 % of the variance in Timed Up and Go ( p = 0.001) , and 18.2 % of the variance in 6 Minute Walk Test ( p = 0.001). Lower balance-confidence is associated with less community participation , lower self-perceived mobility , and poorer performance among patients with a unilateral lower-limb amputation.
