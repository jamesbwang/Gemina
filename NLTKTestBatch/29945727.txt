 Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> is often key in the management of obese or overweight patients with type 2 diabetes , yet few treatments for diabetes achieve clinically meaningful weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. We aimed to assess the efficacy , tolerability , and safety of treatment with MEDI0382 , a balanced glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon receptor dual agonist developed to provide glycaemic control and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , in patients with type 2 diabetes. This randomised , placebo-controlled , double-blind , combined multiple-ascending dose ( MAD) and phase 2a study was done at 11 study sites ( hospitals and contract research organisations) in Germany. We enrolled patients aged 18-65 years with controlled type 2 diabetes ( glycated haemoglobin A Patients were recruited between Dec 9 , 2015 , and Feb 24 , 2017. 61 patients were randomly assigned to the MAD part of the study ( 42 to MEDI0382 and 19 to placebo). 51 patients were randomly assigned to the phase 2a part , of whom 25 were randomly assigned to MEDI0382 and 26 to placebo. In the phase 2a study , three patients in the MEDI0382 group and one in the placebo group discontinued , all as a result of adverse events. 22 ( 88 %) patients in the MEDI0382 group and 25 ( 96 %) in the placebo group received at least one dose and had measurements taken at baseline and day 41. Glucose AUC MEDI0382 has the potential to deliver clinically meaningful reductions in blood glucose and bodyweight in obese or overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes. MedImmune.
