 The aim of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of forced extrusion using the sling shot elastic. A 21 year adult patient reported with an Ellis Class VIII fracture of the maxillary right<symptom> lateral incisor. Root canal treatment followed by a fiber reinforced composite post was placed and core build up was done. A metal button was bonded to the tooth. Begg brackets were placed from the second premolar on one side to the second premolar on the opposite side. 0.016 ″ × 0.025 ″ stainless steel was placed in ribbon mode. The ligature wire was placed as a sling shot from the button on the fractured tooth to the two adjacent teeth. 4 mm of extrusion was achieved and there was no evidence of root resorption. Forced extrusion was achieved in four months. The sling shot method is a very effective method of ligation. Light forces are delivered over a long duration with definitive results as compared to the inconsistent force delivery with conventional extrusion mechanics.
