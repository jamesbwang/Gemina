 Hematologic disorders , including thrombocytopenia<symptom> , are a common symptom<symptom> of systemic lupus- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE). An important diagnostic and therapeutic issue is the severe and recurrent thrombocytopenia<symptom> resistant to standard treatment. It requires extensive diagnostics and a multi-directional view on its causes beyond the autoimmune process. Currently , there is no single treatment regimen for these disorders. Corticosteroids ( CS) are the first-line drugs , but their chronic use is a big problem , they are not always successful and often generate a number of complications , especially in moderate<symptom> to high doses. In the case of thrombocytopenia<symptom> associated with the activity of SLE , immunosuppressive therapy is the gold standard and may result in long-term remission of symptoms<symptom> and clinical stabilization. The major problem is thrombocytopenia<symptom> resulting from other causes , such as infection or medications. This study discusses severe recurrent thrombocytopenia<symptom> on the basis of three clinical cases , analyzing both the various causes of disorders , and providing ways of management and treatment. Special attention is paid to the correlation of thrombocytopenia<symptom> with the clinical and immunological activity of SLE. It seems that severe and refractory thrombocytopenia<symptom> may be a critical point and largely determine the management and treatment possibilities of SLE.
