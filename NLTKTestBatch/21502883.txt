 A considerable proportion of contemporary youth have a high risk of obesity-related disorders such as cardiovascular disease<disease> , metabolic syndrome<symptom> , or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease<disease> ( NAFLD). Although there is consistent evidence for the positive effects of physical activity on several health aspects , most adolescents in Colombia are sedentary. It is , therefore , important to implement strategies that generate changes in lifestyle. The HEPAFIT study aims to examine whether a 6-month exercise program has benefits for hepatic fat content and cardiovascular health outcomes among overweight/obese adolescents from Bogotá , Colombia. Altogether , 100 hundred overweight/obese , sedentary adolescents ( aged 11-17 years) attending two public schools in Bogotá , Colombia , will be included in a parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Adolescents will be randomly assigned to an intervention group following one of four curricula: ( 1) the standard physical education curriculum ( 60 min per week of physical activity , n = 25) at low-to-moderate intensity; ( 2) a high-intensity physical education curriculum ( HIPE<disease><symptom> , n = 25) , consisting of endurance and resistance games and non-competitive activities , such as running , gymkhanas , lifting , pushing , wrestling , or hauling , for 60-min sessions , three times per week , with an energy expenditure goal of 300 to 500 kcal/session at 75-85 % maximum heart rate ( HRmax); ( 3) a low-to-moderate intensity physical education curriculum ( LIPE , n = 25) consisting of endurance and resistance games and non-competitive activities ( e.g. , chasing , sprinting , dribbling , or hopping) for 60-min sessions , three times per week with an energy expenditure goal of 300 kcal/session at 55-75 % HRmax; and ( 4) a combined HIPE and LIPE<symptom> curriculum ( n = 25). The HIPE<disease><symptom> , LIPE , and combined interventions were performed in addition to the standard physical education curriculum. The primary outcome for effectiveness is liver fat content , as measured by the controlled attenuation parameter 1 week after the end of the intervention program. The translational focus may be suitable for collecting new information in a school setting on the possible effects of physical activity interventions to reduce liver fat content and to improve metabolic profiles and the cardiometabolic health of overweight/obese adolescents. This may lead to the more efficient use of school physical education resources. ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02753231. Registered on 21 April 2016.
