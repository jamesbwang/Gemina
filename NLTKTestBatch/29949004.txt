 To estimate rates of all-cause and potentially preventable readmissions up to 90 days after discharge for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH) and medical comorbidities associated with readmissions BACKGROUND: Readmission rate is a common metric linked to compensation and used as a proxy to quality of care. Prior studies in SAH have reported 30-day readmission rates of 7-17 % with a higher readmission risk among those with the higher SAH severity , â‰¥ 3 comorbidities , and non-home discharge. Intermediate-term rates , up to 90-days , and the proportion of these readmissions that are potentially preventable are unknown. Furthermore , the specific medical comorbidities associated with readmissions are unknown. Index SAH admissions were identified from the 2013 Nationwide Readmissions Database. All-cause readmissions were defined as any readmission during the 30- , 60- , and 90-day post-discharge period. Potentially preventable readmissions were identified using Prevention Quality Indicators developed by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Unadjusted and adjusted Poisson models were used to identify factors associated with increased readmission rates. Out of 9987 index admissions for SAH , 7949 ( 79 %) survived to discharge. The percentage of 30- , 60- , and 90-day all-cause readmissions were 7.8 , 16.6 , and 26 % , respectively. Up to 14 % of readmissions in the first 30 days were considered potentially preventable and acute conditions ( dehydration<symptom> , bacterial pneumonia<disease> , and urinary<disease> tract<symptom><disease> infections<disease>infections<disease>) accounted for over half , whereas acute cerebrovascular disease<disease> was the most common cause for neurological return. In multivariable analysis , significant predictors of a higher readmission rate included diabetes ( rate ratio ( RR) 1.09 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.03-1.15) , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( RR 1.09 , 1.003-1.18) , and renal impairment ( RR 1.35 , 1.13-1.61). Only discharge home was associated with a lower readmission rate ( RR 0.89 , 0.85-0.93). SAH has a 30-day readmission rate of 7.8 % which continues to rise into the intermediate-term. A low but constant proportion of readmissions are potentially preventable. Several chronic medical comorbidities were associated with readmissions. Prospective studies are warranted to clarify causal relationships.
