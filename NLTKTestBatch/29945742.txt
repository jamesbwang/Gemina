 The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the on-treatment lipid profiles and the CV events in CKD and non-CKD population. This study was a multi-center observational registry , the Taiwanese Secondary Prevention for patients with AtheRosCLErotic disease<disease> ( T-SPARCLE) Registry. This study follows up patients with CV diseases<disease> in Taiwan who have secondary prevention therapies. The primary outcome is the time of first occurrence of a major adverse cardiac events ( MACEs). 5388 patients with ASCVD were included and 1478 ( 27.4 %) had CKD without dialysis. CKD patients had higher TG and lower LDL-C levels. The incidence of recurrent MACEs per 1000 person-years in CKD patients was 19.5 ( 95 % CI 15.5-24.9) , compared with 9.1 ( 95 % CI 7.4-11.1) in non-CKD patients. In patients with statin therapy , there were no differences in MACE risk between each level of on-treatment LDL-C , TG and HDL-C level. Higher on-treatment non-HDL-C level was a significant predictor for higher MACE risk in patients without CKD , and borderline significant in CKD patients under statin therapy. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> history was also associated with higher MACE risk in both group. Lower body mass index ( BMI < 23 kg/m In ASCVD patients , on-treatment LDL-C was not a good CV outcome predictor. Instead , on-treatment non-HDL-C was a better predictor. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> history was also associated with higher MACE risk in both group of patients. Lower BMI ( < 23 kg/m
