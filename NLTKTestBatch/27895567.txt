 Searching for evidence of consciousness<symptom> in outwardly unresponsive patients presents significant clinical challenges as the spectrum of disorders of consciousness<symptom> has become more clearly defined , with clinical examination , functional MRI , and electrophysiologic tests having complementary roles in the investigation of minimally conscious patients , those in a locked-in state , coma<symptom> , or in a vegetative state. Serial bedside electrophysiologic testing can probe for higher order cortical responses temporally and spatially propagated through cortical networks , while long-latency event-related potentials may help differentiate patients with coma<symptom> or vegetative state from a state of residual consciousness<symptom>. Transcranial magnetic stimulation co-registered to high-density EEG may reveal widespread pulse-stimulated cortical activation of various brain regions. These emerging electrophysiologic techniques show promise as powerful diagnostic , prognostic , and therapeutic tools.
