 In order to investigate the effect of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase ( SAMDC) gene in melon resistance to powdery mildew , according to the previous results of EST sequences from cDNA-AFLP library and the melon genome sequence data , the SAMDC gene was isolated from Chinese wild melon clone ` Yuntian930 ' by RT-PCR and designated as CmSAMDC ( GenBank Accession No. KF151861). The mORF ( main open reading frame) was 1 095 bp encoding 364 amino acids with a molecular mass of 40 kDa. The predicted protein sequence showed high similarity with Cucumis sativus and Citrofortunella microcarpa. The SDS-PAGE showed that the expression protein was a fusion protein with the molecular weight<symptom> of 40 kDa , which perfectly matched the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that the expression level of CmSAMDC reached a maximum at 48 hpi ( hours post inoculation) that over 7-fold to 0 hpi , and the expression of CmSAMDC was also detected in tendril , root , leaf and stem. These results indicate that CmSAMDC gene may play protective roles in melon resistance to powdery mildew infection<disease>.
