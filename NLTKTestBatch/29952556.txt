 Metal organic framework ( MOF)/ polymer composite membranes<symptom> are of interest for gas separations as they often have performance that exceeds the neat polymer. However , traditional composite membranes<symptom> , known as mixed matrix membranes<symptom> ( MMMs) , can have complex and time-consuming preparation procedures. The MOF and polymer are traditionally prepared separately , and require priming and mixing to ensure uniform distribution of particles and compatibility of the polymer/particle interface. In this study , we reduce the number of steps using an in-situ MOF growth strategy. Herein , MMMs are prepared by growing MOF ( UiO-66) in-situ within a Matrimid ® polymer matrix while simultaneously curing the matrix. The gas separation performance for MMMs prepared using this approach was evaluated for CO2/N2 separation and compared to MMMs made using the traditional post-synthesis mixing. It was found that MMMs prepared using both the in-situ MOF growth strategy and by traditional post-synthesis mixing are equivalent in performance. However , using in-situ MOF growth allows for a simpler , faster , and potentially more economical fabrication alternative for MMMs.
