 Mutations in MYH2 that encodes myosin heavy chain IIa cause both dominant and recessively inherited myopathies. Patients with dominantly inherited MYH2 missense mutations present with ophthalmoplegia<symptom> and progressive proximal<symptom> limb<symptom> weakness<symptom>. Muscle biopsy reveals rimmed vacuoles and inclusions<disease> , prompting this entity to initially be described as hereditary inclusion body myopathy 3. In contrast , patients with recessive MYH2 mutations have early onset , non-progressive , diffuse weakness<symptom> and ophthalmoplegia<symptom>. Muscle biopsy reveals near or complete absence of type 2A fibers with no vacuole or inclusion pathology. We describe a patient with childhood onset ophthalmoplegia<symptom> , progressive proximal<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> beginning in adolescence , and muscle biopsy with myopathic changes and rimmed vacuoles. Although this patient 's disease<disease> course and histopathology is consistent with dominant MYH2 mutations , whole exome sequencing revealed a c. 737 G > A p.Arg246His homozygous MYH2 variant. These findings expand the clinical and pathologic phenotype of recessive MYH2 myopathies.
