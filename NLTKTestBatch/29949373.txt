 The compositional evolution of the network structure and connectivity in binary SnO-P2O5 glasses with 35 ≤ mol % SnO ≤ 55 is studied using two-dimensional 119Sn and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) spectroscopy. The phosphate Qn species concentrations , as obtained from the analyses of the 31P NMR spectral line shapes suggest that the network modification can be described in terms of a binary Q-speciation model. On the other hand , the 119Sn NMR spectra suggest that the Sn-O coordination<symptom> environment in these glasses is composition dependent. Sn is present in both threefold ( trigonal pyramid) and fourfold ( trigonal bipyramid) coordination<symptom> with oxygen in these glasses. The relative fraction of the trigonal pyramidal environment increases with increasing SnO content. The unusually low glass transition temperature Tg of these glasses ( 241-266 ºC) is argued to be related to the low coordination<symptom> number of Sn , leading to a relatively sparsely connected structural network.
