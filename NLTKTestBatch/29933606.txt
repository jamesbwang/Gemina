 8-Hydroxydaidzein ( 8-HD) is a daidzein metabolite isolated from soybeans. This compound has been studied for its anti-proliferation , depigmentation , and antioxidant activities. However , the anti-inflammatory activities of 8-HD are not well-understood. Through its antioxidant effects in ABTS and DPPH assays , 8-HD reduces the production of sodium nitroprusside ( SNP)- induced radical oxygen species ( ROS). By triggering various Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) , 8-HD suppresses the inflammatory mediator nitric oxide ( NO) without cytotoxicity. We examined the regulatory mechanism of 8-HD in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced conditions. We found that 8-HD diminishes inflammatory gene expression ( e.g. , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) , cyclooxygenase ( COX) -2 , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- & alpha ;-RRB- by regulating the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor ( NF)- & kappa; B and activator protein 1 ( AP-1). To find the potential targets of 8-HD , signaling pathways were investigated by immunoblotting analyses. These analyses revealed that 8-HD inhibits the activation of TAK1 and that phosphorylated levels of downstream molecules decrease in sequence. Together , our results demonstrate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of 8-HD and suggest its potential use in cosmetics or anti-inflammatory drugs.
