 The inventory and input/output balance<symptom> of trace elements in farmland play an important role in risk assessment and soil management , but there is little information about nationwide changes of the input/output balance<symptom> of trace elements in farmland in China. In the present study , the inventory of trace element inputs to farmland was updated based on the dataset from the literature published during 2006-2015 , and changes of the input/output balance<symptom> were investigated. Compared with 1999-2006 , net inputs of Cr , Ni , and Zn increased by 52.9 % , 59.7 % , and 20.6 % , respectively. The increases in fossil fuel derived energy consumption , industrial manufacture , municipal solid waste incineration , and transportation were the predominant contributors to these increases. Net inputs of Cd , Cu , and Hg decreased dramatically by 46.7 % , 25.2 % , and 50.4 % , respectively. The decreases are due to the strict management of feed additives , fertilizers , and emissions of atmospheric pollutants. Net inputs of As and Pb still remained relatively stable. These results demonstrated that better achievements have been gained by administration of air , water and soil in China. Regulation of atmospheric emission for Cr , Ni , and Zn was recommended as atmospheric deposition was the predominant source for increases of Cr , Ni , and Zn inputs to farmland across China.
