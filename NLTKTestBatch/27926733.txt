 High temporal resolution water distribution maps are essential for surface water monitoring because surface water exhibits significant inner-annual variation. Therefore , high-frequency remote sensing data are needed for surface water mapping. Dongting Lake , the second-largest freshwater lake in China , is famous for the seasonal fluctuations<symptom> of its inundation extents in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River<disease>. It is also greatly affected by the Three Gorges Project. In this study , we used Sentinel-1 data to generate surface water maps of Dongting Lake at 10 m resolution. First , we generated the Sentinel-1 time series backscattering coefficient for VH and VV polarizations at 10 m resolution by using a monthly composition method. Second , we generated the thresholds for mapping surface water at 10 m resolution with monthly frequencies using Sentinel-1 data. Then , we derived the monthly surface water distribution product of Dongting Lake in 2016 , and finally , we analyzed the inner-annual surface water dynamics. The results showed that: ( 1) The thresholds were -21.56 and -15.82 dB for the backscattering coefficients for VH and VV , respectively , and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients were above 95.50 % and 0.90 , respectively , for the VH backscattering coefficient , and above 94.50 % and 0.88 , respectively , for the VV backscattering coefficient. The VV backscattering coefficient achieved lower accuracy due to the effect of the wind causing roughness on the surface of the water. ( 2) The maximum and minimum areas of surface water were 2040.33 km
