 Main aims of our study were to investigate occurrence of Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> among hospitalized pediatric patients in Georgia and examine risk factors for the development of C.<pathogen> difficile infection. During our study we tested and piloted the real-time PCR diagnostic systems for rapid and simultaneous identification of C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> and number of other pathogens in our facility settings. A cross-sectional study has been performed in children less than 18 years of age in two pediatric hospitals in Georgia , between May 2016 and December 2017. Stool<symptom> specimens negative by the conventional bacteriology analysis were analyzed for the presence of C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> and several viral and protozoa pathogens using enzyme immune assay and polymerase chain reaction. In total samples from 220 hospitalized children with gastroenteritis<disease><symptom> symptoms<symptom> were analyzed in this study. The average age of the study participants was 4.7 years. Overall 23 children were identified positive for C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> ( 10.5 %). Antibiotic exposure within 2 months preceding the onset of diarrhea<disease><symptom> was associated with an increased risk of C.<pathogen> difficile infections. The risk was greatest with cephalosporins , followed by penicillins , carbapenems and macrolides. Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> is an important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea<disease><symptom> in pediatric population of Georgia.
