 Coping with psychological trauma plays a central role in victims of acts of violence. The Victim Reparation Law ( in German: Opferentsch√§digungsgesetz , OEG) provides services for the reparation of participation. To further improve the care of the affected persons , the characteristics of the victims were determined in relation to the acts and the perpetrators. 312 OEG-files of adult victims were sighted. On the basis of a system of categories , demographic data , trauma specific and health-related characteristics of the victims , relevant characteristics of the perpetrators and the violence , as well as predictors for the time difference between the violent act and the application were determined. Mostly women ( 71 %) were affected by acts of violence. 49 % of the affected persons suffered from physical and 87 % from psychological impairment ( 64 % of these from a posttraumatic stress disorder). 55 % of the acts of violence were sex crimes , 47 % were bodily injuries and in 44 % additional psychological abuse existed. The perpetrators were often connected to the victims. 42 % of the offenses concerned domestic violence. Time difference between the act of violence and the request for help which is provided by law variated between 0 and 52 years. 50 % made use of help within one year , further 15.2 % within five years. In 34.3 % of cases , time difference was longer than 5 years. In case of serial and severe traumatizations , depression<symptom> and close connections between victim and perpetrator help provided by law was called for only late. Many victims of acts of violence acts are psychologically traumatized. In order to prevent a traumatization from becoming a permanent health disorder , the offering of early evidence-based specialist or psychological acute therapy ( e. g. , in trauma outpatient clinics) ought to be optimized.
