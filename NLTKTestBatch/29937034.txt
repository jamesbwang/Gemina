 Long-term patency of arteriovenous fistulas<disease> ( AVFs) is critical for hemodialysis vascular access. We compared the efficacy of a one-stage vs two-stage approach to brachiobasilic AVF creation by primarily investigating primary and secondary patency rates. We hypothesize that the two-stage is superior to the one-stage procedure in terms of efficacy and safety. This review was performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Searches were performed on MEDLINE , EMBASE , Google Scholar , and Cochrane Database. Risk of bias and quality assessment scores were both performed based on previously validated tool. The systematic search revealed a total of 242 publications for possible inclusion. On the basis of title and abstract review , two randomized controlled trials and nine case-cohort series fit our inclusion criteria. There were no statistically significant differences in failure rates ( pooled risk ratio ( RR) , 1.10; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.79-1.55; P = .25) , 1-year primary patency rates ( RR , 1.31; 95 % CI , 0.83-2.06; P = .24) , 1-year secondary patency rates ( RR , 0.97; 95 % CI , 0.54-1.77) and 2-year secondary patency rates ( RR , 1.19; 95 % CI , 0.54-2.63; P = .67) between both groups. However , the two-stage procedure had significantly improved 2-year primary patency rates ( RR , 2.50; 95 % CI , 1.66-3.74; P < .00001). There were no differences in steal syndrome<symptom> , hematoma , infection , pseudoaneuryms , or stenosis , although there was a trend toward an increased incidence of postoperative thrombosis ( RR , 1.81; 95 % CI , 0.95-3.45; P = .07) in one-stage procedures. With improved 2-year primary patency rates and the absence of significant differences in complications , this study suggests potential benefit of a two-stage over a one-stage procedure for brachiobasilic AVF creation. However , rather than being a definitive answer , our results merely highlight the continuing need for an adequately powered , well-designed , randomized controlled trial to interrogate this question further.
