 The hyperplastic processes of the endometrium can arise not only against the background of excessive influence of estrogen , but also against the background of epigenetic damages that affect apoptosis , cell proliferation , differentiation , and adhesion , and DNA reparation. The aim of our study was to investigate and analyze the status<symptom> of methylation of the promoter of SFRP2 gene in patients with hyperplastic processes of the endometrium. The study groups were the following: I- patients with endometrial hyperplasia<disease> ( EH , n = 9); II- patients with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia ( EIN , n = 10) , III- control groups: 1) with endometrial cancer ( EC , n = 4) , and 2) healthy women ( n = 4). Determination of promoter methylation of SFRP2 gene was carried out by the semiquantitative method of methylation-specific PCR assay. The maximum level of methylation of SFRP2 gene promoter had been revealed in patients with EC- 42.80 ± 3.55 % ( р < 0.05). The patients of the I group had the lowest values of methylation of SFRP2 gene promoter- 10.66 ± 0.85 % , while in patients of the II group this indicator was higher- 20.60 ± 0.95 % ( р < 0.05). In healthy women of the control group , methylation of SFRP2 gene promoter was detected in none of the samples. The content of the methylated SFRP2 gene in endometrial tissue of patients with hyperplastic processes higher than 20-25 % allows relate these women to the risk group of EC development and dictates the need of intensive observation of such patients.
