 Patients suffering from Fabry disease<disease> ( FD) , a lysosomal storage disorder , show a broad range of symptoms<symptom> and the diagnosis followed by the therapeutic decision remains a great challenge. The biomarkers available today have not proven to be useful for predicting the evolution of the disease<disease> and for assessing response to therapy in many patients. Here , we used high-throughput microRNA profiling methodology to identify a specific circulating microRNA profile in FD patients. We discovered a pattern of 10 microRNAs able to identify FD patients when compared to healthy controls. Notably , two of these: the miR199a-5p and the miR-126-3p are able to discriminate FDs from the control subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy , a frequent but non-specific FD symptom<symptom>. These same microRNAs are also sensitive to enzyme replacement therapy showing variation in the subjects under treatment. Furthermore , two other microRNAs of the profile , the miR-423-5p and the miR-451a , seem useful to highlight cardiac involvement in FD patients. A literature and database search revealed that miR-199a-5p , miR-126-3p , miR-423-5p and miR-451a are known to be linked to pathological states that occur during the FD development. In particular , miR-199a-5p , and miR-126-3p are involved in endothelial dysfunction and miR-423-5p and miR-451a in myocardial remodeling. In conclusion , in this study we identified a common plasma microRNA profile in FD patients , useful not only for the correct classification of Fabry patients regardless of sex and age , but also to evaluate the response to therapy. Furthermore , our observations suggest that some microRNAs of this profile demonstrate prognostic qualities.
