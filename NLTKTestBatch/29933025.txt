 Enteroendocrine cells in the insect midgut are thought to secrete peptide hormones in response to the nutritional state. However , the role of dietary compounds in inducing peptide hormone secretion from enteroendocrine cells in insects remains unknown. In the present study , we demonstrated that several dietary compounds from mulberry leaves , including glucose , amino acids , and the secondary metabolite chlorogenic acid , induced significant secretion of tachykinin-related peptides from isolated silkworm midguts at the luminal concentrations measured in fed larvae. This study provides evidence that the insect midgut senses a non-nutritious secondary metabolite in addition to nutrient metabolites to monitor luminal food status<symptom> and secretes a feeding regulatory hormone , suggesting that a unique dietary sensory system modulates insect feeding via enteroendocrine control.
