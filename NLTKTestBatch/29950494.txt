 A dural arteriovenous fistula<disease> ( DAVF) presenting with acute subdural haematoma ( ASDH) , which were not related to head injury , is rare. A 61-year-old woman was transported by ambulance because of deterioration of consciousness<symptom>. On admission , she was comatose with anisocoria. Emergent CT demonstrated a severe midline shift associated with a left ASDH and an additional left occipital intracerebral haematoma , both of which had no continuity with each other. MRI showed flow void signs in the left occipital lobe. Because of the impending cerebral herniation , an emergent evacuation of the ASDH and external decompression was performed. Subsequent evaluation revealed a DAVF at the left occipital convexity near the confluence with retrograde leptomeningeal venous reflux and venous ectasia ( Cognard type III DAVF). The patient underwent endovascular treatment for the DAVF involving transarterial embolisation using coils and
