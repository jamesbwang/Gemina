 Luehea divaricata Mart. ( Malvaceae) is an important medicinal species that is widely used as a diuretic in the Brazilian Pantanal region. An ethanolic supernatant that was obtained from an infusion of leaves of this species ( ESLD) was recently shown to exert hypotensive and diuretic activity. Nevertheless , the secondary metabolites that are responsible for this activity and the molecular mechanisms of pharmacological action remain unknown. We performed a detailed study to identify possible active metabolites that are present in different ESLD fractions and investigated their effects on renal and peripheral arteriolar tone. We further evaluated their interrelations with sustained diuretic and hypotensive actions. The ESLD was first obtained from L. divaricata leaves , and liquid-liquid fractionation was performed. The fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. An ethyl acetate fraction ( AceFr) , n-butanolic fraction ( ButFr) , and aqueous fraction ( AqueFr) were then orally administered in male Wistar rats in a single dose or daily for 7 days. The doses were previously defined based on the yield that was obtained from each fraction. Hydrochlorothiazide was used as a positive control. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , heart rate , urinary volume , pH , density , and urinary sodium , potassium , chloride , and calcium levels were measured. Serum levels of nitrite , thiobarbituric acid reactive species , nitrotyrosine , aldosterone , vasopressin , and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity were also measured. Finally , the direct effects of the ButFr on renal and mesenteric arteriolar tone and the role of nitric oxide and prostaglandins in the renal and hemodynamic effects were investigated. Of the fractions that were tested , only the ButFr exerted significant diuretic and saluretic effects. The AceFr and ButFr also had acute hypotensive effects , but only the ButFr maintained its response after 7 days of treatment. Prolonged treatment with the ButFr increased serum nitrite levels and significantly reduced oxidative and nitrosative markers of stress. Additionally , the ButFr caused a vasodilatory response in the renal and mesenteric arteriolar beds through the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins. Finally , the diuretic and hypotensive effects of the ButFr were completely blocked by pretreatment with NÏ‰-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and indomethacin , thus demonstrating the direct involvement of nitric oxide and prostaglandins in these effects. The ButFr that was obtained from Luehea divaricata exerted sustained diuretic and hypotensive effects. These effects were apparently attributable to the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins , which reduce renal and peripheral arteriolar tone and lead to an increase in the glomerular filtration rate and a reduction of global peripheral resistance. These findings suggest that the ButFr may be a potential complementary therapy for several conditions in which diuretic and hypotensive effects are required.
