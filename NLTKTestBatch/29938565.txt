 Recent pilot trials suggest feasibility and potential efficacy of psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment interventions. Fifteen participants completed a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation pilot study between 2009 and 2015. The aims of this study were as follows: ( 1) to identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking cessation in the pilot study; ( 2) to identify key themes in participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better understand the therapeutic process. Participants were invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30 months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Participants reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of interconnectedness , awe , and curiosity persisted beyond the duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term withdrawal symptoms<symptom>. Preparatory counselling , strong rapport with the study team , and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving abstinence. In addition , participants reported a range of persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation , including increased aesthetic appreciation , altruism , and pro-social behaviour. The findings highlight the value of qualitative research in the psychopharmacological investigation of psychedelics. They describe perceived connections between drug- and non-drug factors , and provide suggestions for future research trial design and clinical applications.
