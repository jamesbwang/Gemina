 Circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA) is released into circulation ( blood) specifically from tumor cells undergoing metabolic secretion , apoptosis , or necrosis<symptom> , carries tumor-specific genetic or epigenetic alterations. Technologies enabling clinical evaluation of ctDNA continue to advance rapidly and allow for the assessment of patient-specific tumoral genetic and epigenetic alterations. This holds great potential for earlier detection of disease<disease> , serial monitoring of tumor heterogeneity , identification of therapeutic targets , and evaluation of treatment response and mechanisms of resistance. Hepatobiliary malignancies are often diagnosed late , recur commonly , yield limited available tumor on biopsy , and harbor several genomic alterations with potential therapeutic impacts. Patients suffering from or at risk for these diseases<disease> thus stand to benefit immensely from this technology. Herein , we review the limited literature pertaining to the potential for ctDNA technologies in such patients. Patients with these cancers stand to benefit greatly from the application of ctDNA technologies , and concerted efforts at further investigation of such are ongoing and greatly needed.
