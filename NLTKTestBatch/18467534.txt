 Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia. Depression<symptom> is one of the major important public health problems that is often comorbid with diabetes. Despite the huge effect of comorbid depression<symptom> and diabetes , the overall pooled prevalence of depression<symptom> among diabetic patients in the country level remains unknown. Therefore , the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to estimate the pooled prevalence of depression<symptom> among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. Data extraction was designed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were accessed through electronic web-based search from PubMed , Cochrane Library , Google Scholar , Embase , and PsycINFO. All statistical analyses were done using STATA version 11 software using random effects model. The pooled prevalence was presented in forest plots. A total of 9 studies with 2944 participants were included in this meta-analysis and the overall pooled estimated prevalence of depression<symptom> among diabetic patients in Ethiopia was 39.73 % ( 95 % CI ( 28.02 % , 51.45 %)). According to subgroup analysis the estimated prevalence of depression<symptom> in Addis Ababa was 52.9 % ( 95 % CI: 36.93 % , 68.88 %) and in Oromia region was 45.49 % ( 95 % CI: 41.94 , 49.03 %). The analysis revealed that the overall prevalence of comorbid depression<symptom> among diabetic patients in Ethiopia was high. Therefore , Ministry of Health should design multisectorial approach and context specific interventions that address this comorbid depression<symptom> in this specific group as well as general population.
