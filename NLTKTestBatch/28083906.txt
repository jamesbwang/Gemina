 The prognostic relevance of strokes in different locations is debated. For example , insular strokes have been associated with increased mortality , but this association could reflect their greater severity. In two independent cohorts of patients with supratentorial ischemic stroke ( n = 90 and 105) , we studied the prognostic consequences of lesion<symptom> size and location using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping before and after volume control , which better accounts for total lesion<symptom> volume. Strokes affecting the insula were larger than non-insular strokes ( 28 vs 2cc and 25 vs 3cc , p < 0.001 in both cohorts). A number of supratentorial areas ( mainly in the left hemisphere) , including the insula , were associated with poor functional outcome in both cohorts before ( 4014 voxels) and after volume control ( 1378 voxels) , while the associations with death were greatly reduced after volume control ( from 8716 to 325 voxels). Exploratory analyses suggested that the method of lesion<symptom> volume quantification , the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale hemispheric bias and patient selection can result in false associations between specific brain lesions<symptom> and outcomes. In conclusion , death in the first months after stroke is mainly explained by large infarct volumes , whereas lesions<symptom> of specific supratentorial structures , mostly in the left hemisphere , also contribute to poor functional outcomes.
