 Gains in life expectancy through optimal control of HIV<pathogen> infection with antiretroviral therapy ( ART) may be threatened if other comorbidities , such as diabetes , are not optimally managed. We analyzed cross-sectional data of the Women 's Interagency HIV<pathogen> Study ( WIHS) from 2001 , 2006 , and 2015. We estimated the proportions of HIV-positive and HIV-negative women with diabetes who were engaged in care and achieved treatment goals ( hemoglobin A1c ( A1c) < 7.0 % , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) < 140/90 mmHg , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) cholesterol < 100 mg/dL , not smoking) and viral suppression. Repeated-measures models were used to estimate the adjusted prevalence of achieving each diabetes treatment goal at each time point , by HIV<pathogen> status. We included 486 HIV-positive and 258 HIV-negative women with diabetes. In 2001 , 91.8 % visited a health care provider , 60.7 % achieved the A1c target , 70.5 % achieved the BP target , 38.5 % achieved the LDL cholesterol target , 49.2 % were nonsmokers , 23.3 % achieved combined ABC targets ( A1c , BP , and cholesterol) , and 10.9 % met combined ABC targets and did not smoke. There were no differences by HIV<pathogen> status , and patterns were similar in 2006 and 2015. Among HIV-positive women , viral suppression increased from 41 % in 2001 to 87 % in 2015 compared with 8 % and 13 % achieving the ABC goals and not smoking. Viral suppression was not associated with achievement of diabetes care goals. Successful management of HIV<pathogen> is outpacing that of diabetes. Future studies are needed to identify factors associated with gaps in the HIV-diabetes care continuum and design interventions to better integrate effective diabetes management into HIV<pathogen> care.
