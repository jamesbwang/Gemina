 Following the initial detection of viral<disease> infection<disease>infection<disease> , innate immune responses trigger the induction of numerous interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs) to inhibit virus<pathogen> replication and dissemination. One such ISG encodes cholesterol-25-hydroxylase ( CH25H) , an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol to form a soluble product , 25-hydroxycholesterol ( 25HC). Recent studies have found that CH25H is broadly antiviral; it inhibits infection<disease> by several viruses<pathogen>. For enveloped viruses<pathogen> , 25HC inhibits membrane fusion , likely by altering membrane characteristics such as hydrophobicity or cholesterol aggregation. However , mechanisms by which 25HC restricts infection<disease> of non-enveloped viruses<pathogen> are unknown. We examined whether 25HC restricts infection<disease> by mammalian reovirus<pathogen>. Treatment with 25HC restricted infection<disease> by reovirus<pathogen> prototype strains type 1 Lang and type 3 Dearing. In contrast to reovirus<pathogen> virions , 25HC did not restrict infection<disease> by reovirus<pathogen> infectious subvirion particles , ISVPs , which can penetrate either directly at the cell surface or in early endosomal membranes<symptom>. Treatment with 25HC altered trafficking of reovirus<pathogen> particles to late endosomes and delayed the kinetics of reovirus<pathogen> uncoating. These results suggest that 25HC inhibits the efficiency of cellular entry of reovirus<pathogen> virions , which may require specific endosomal membrane dynamics for efficient membrane penetration.
