 To explore associations between remission , based on clinical and ultrasound definitions , and future good radiographic and physical outcome in early rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA). Newly diagnosed patients with RA followed a treat-to-target strategy incorporating ultrasound information in the Aiming for Remission in rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom>: a randomised trial examining the benefit of ultrasound in a Clinical TIght Control regimen ( ARCTIC) trial. We defined 6-month remission according to Disease<disease> Activity Score , Disease<disease> Activity Score in 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate , American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism ( ACR/EULAR) Boolean criteria , Simplified Disease<disease> Activity Index , Clinical Disease<disease> Activity Index and two ultrasound definitions ( no power Doppler signal , grey scale score ≤ 2). Two outcomes were defined: no radiographic progression and good outcome ( no radiographic progression + physical function ≥ general population median) , both sustained 12-24 months. We calculated the ORs of these outcomes for the remission definitions. Of 103 patients , 42 % -82 % reached remission at 6 months , dependent on definition. Seventy-one per cent of patients had no radiographic progression and 37 % had good outcome. An association between 6-month remission and no radiographic progression was observed for ACR/EULAR Boolean remission ( 44 joints , OR 3.2 , 95 % CI 1.2 to 8.4) , ultrasound power Doppler ( OR 3.6 , 95 % CI 1.3 to 10.0) and grey scale remission ( OR 3.2 , 95 % CI 1.2 to 8.0). All clinical , but not ultrasound remission criteria were associated with achievement of a good outcome. Our data support ACR/EULAR Boolean remission based on 44 joints as the preferred treatment target in early RA. Absence of ultrasound inflammation<symptom> was associated with no radiographic progression. NCT01205854; Post-results.
