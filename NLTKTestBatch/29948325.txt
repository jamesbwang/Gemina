 To investigate F-wave as a method to identify a specific root lesion<symptom> of L5 or S1 and to quantitatively evaluate the severity and progression of motor root lesions<symptom> in lumbosacral radiculopathies ( LR). Both peroneal and tibial F-waves were performed bilaterally in 142 patients with unilateral L5 or S1 radiculopathies and 37 controls along with Medical Research Council ( MRC) evaluation , and soleus H-reflexes were tested bilaterally in 78 of these 142 cases. Both F-wave and MRC were re-evaluated approximately 1 year after initial examination in 65 patients. Abnormal peroneal F-waves were found in 34 patients with L5 radiculopathy ( 34/67 , 50.7 %) along with normal tibial F-waves and soleus H-reflexes in all tested cases. By contrast , 27 patients with S1 radiculopathy presented abnormal tibial F-waves ( 27/76 , 36.0 %) along with normal peroneal F-waves in all 76 cases and abnormal soleus H-reflexes in 38 of 47 ( 80.9 %) cases. There were significant differences in involved side F-duration among different MRC scales in both radiculopathy groups ( P < 0.05). Follow-up analysis demonstrated slow progression of both F-wave abnormalities and muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> in patients undergoing conservative treatment ( P < 0.05). Comparisons of F-waves between the same nerve on both sides and between peroneal and tibial nerves<symptom> in the same leg may clearly increase the validity of F-waves for evaluating a specific motor root lesion<symptom> of L5 or S1. Furthermore , a quantitative comparison of F-waves may provide additional information on the severity of individual root lesions<symptom> and their progression even in the early stages of disease<disease>.
