 The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of montelukast and levocetirizine in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma compared with the efficacy and safety of montelukast alone. This study was a 4-week , randomized , multicenter , double-blind , Phase III trial. After a 1-week placebo run-in period , the subjects were randomized to receive montelukast ( 10mg/day , n = 112) or montelukast ( 10 mg/day)/ levocetirizine ( 5 mg/day) ( n = 116) treatment for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was mean daytime nasal symptom<symptom> score. Other efficacy end points included mean nighttime nasal symptom<symptom> score , mean composite symptom<symptom> score , overall assessment of allergic rhinitis by both subjects and physicians , forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV Of 333 patients screened for this study , 228 eligible patients were randomized to treatment. The mean ( SD) age of patients was 43.32 ( 15.02) years , and two thirds of subjects were female ( 66.67 %). The demographic characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. Compared with the montelukast group , the montelukast/levocetirizine group reported significant reductions in mean daytime nasal symptom<symptom> score ( least squares mean ( SE) of combination vs montelukast , -0.98 ( 0.06) vs -0.81 ( 0.06); P = 0.045). For all other allergic rhinitis efficacy end points , the montelukast/levocetirizine group showed greater improvement than the montelukast group. Similar results were observed in overall assessment scores and in FEV The fixed-dose combination of montelukast and levocetirizine was effective and safe in treating perennial allergic rhinitis in patients with asthma compared with montelukast alone.
