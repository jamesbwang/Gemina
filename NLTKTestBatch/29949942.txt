 Hemagglutinin ( HA) of influenza<disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> is a major target for vaccines. HA initiates the internalization of the virus<pathogen> into the host cell by binding to host sialic acid receptors; therefore , inhibition of HA can significantly prevent influenza<disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection<disease>. However , the high diversity of HA permits the influenza<disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> to escape from host immunity. Moreover , the vaccine efficacy is poor in some high-risk populations ( e.g. , elderly or immunocompromised patients). Passive immunization with anti-HA monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) is an attractive therapy; however , this method has high production costs and requires repeated inoculations. To address these issues , several methods for long-term expression of mAb against influenza<disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> have been developed. Here , we provide an overview of methods using plasmid and viral adeno-associated virus<pathogen> ( AAV) vectors that have been modified for higher expression of neutralizing antibodies in the host. We also examine two methods of injection , electro-transfer and hydrodynamic injection. Our results show that antibody gene transfer is effective against influenza<disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection<disease> even in immunocompromised mice , and antibody expression was detected in the serum and upper respiratory<disease> tract<symptom>. We also demonstrate this method to be effective following influenza<disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection<disease>. Finally , we discuss the perspective of passive immunization with antibody gene transfer for future clinical trials.
