 Both Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection and metabolic syndrome<symptom> present significant global public health burdens. Metabolic syndrome<symptom> is closely related to insulin resistance , the major underlying mechanism responsible for metabolic abnormalities , and Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection has been proposed to be a contributing factor. There is growing evidence for a potential association between Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection and insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome<symptom> and related morbidity , including abdominal obesity , type 2 diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , hypertension , all of which increase mortality related to cardio-cerebrovascular disease<disease> , neurodegenerative disorders , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease<disease> and malignancies. More specifically , insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome<symptom> and hyperinsulinemia have been associated with upper and lower gastrointestinal tract oncogenesis. Apart from cardio-cerebrovascular , degenerative diseases<disease> and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease<disease> , a number of studies claim that Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection is implicated in metabolic syndrome-related Barrett 's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma development , gastric and duodenal ulcers<disease><symptom> and gastric oncogenesis as well as lower gastrointestinal tract oncogenesis. This review summarizes evidence on the potential impact of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori-related metabolic syndrome<symptom> on gastroesophageal reflux disease-Barrett 's esophagus-esophageal adenocarcinoma , gastric atrophy-intestinal metaplasia-dysplasia-gastric cancer and colorectal adenoma-dysplasia-colorectal cancer sequences. Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication might inhibit these oncogenic processes , and thus further studies are warranted.
