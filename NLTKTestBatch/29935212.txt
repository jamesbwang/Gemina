 To measure the thickness and length of corneal nerves<symptom> and the peri-papillary retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL) thickness in patients recently diagnosed with diabetes mellitus ( DM). Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients recently diagnosed with type 2 DM and 22 eyes of 22 healthy individuals were consecutively enrolled. Central corneal sensitivity was measured using a Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer , and corneal nerve length ( CNL) and thickness ( CNT) were evaluated through in vivo confocal microscopy. The confocal images were examined using software that could semi-automatically trace the corneal nerve pathway. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT) was performed to quantify the overall and sectorial RNFL thickness. Mean DM duration was 3.5 ± 1.7 months , whereas the mean glycemia and HbA1c levels were 180.5 ± 73.13 mg/dl and 8.6 ± 1.7 % ( 65.2 ± 19.7 mmol/mol) , respectively. Corneal<symptom> sensation<symptom> threshold was significantly lower in the DM group compared to control group ( p = 0.003). CNL and CNT were reduced in the DM group ( p = 0.043 and p = 0.004 , respectively). Significant correlations were found between CNT and HbA1c levels ( p = 0.04; r = -0.47) , and between CNT and the corneal<symptom> sensation<symptom> threshold ( p = 0.04; r = 0.69). RNFL thickness was significantly reduced in the temporal quadrants , but no correlation was found with CNT and CNL changes ( p > 0.05). CNL and CNT changes are evident even in the early stages of DM , and RNFL reduction was recorded in the temporal quadrants. These findings indicate that , in the eye with diabetes , neuropathy may represent an early marker of the disease<disease>.
