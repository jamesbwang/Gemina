 The volume of activated tissue ( VTA) is a model that try to represent in 3D the diffusion of the current provided by the DBS lead on brain structures. The objective of the present study was to assess the correlations between the VTA , activation of the corticospinal tract<symptom> , and the intra-operative side effect ( ISE) threshold. This double-blind , single-center study was performed between September , 2016 , and July , 2017. We identified two groups for statistical analysis: the entire study population , and a subset of patients with additional diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) data for determining the location of the pyramidal tract<symptom>. We determined the intensity threshold at which the VTA reached the border of the target nucleus ( referred to as VTAn) and the intensity threshold when the VTA reached the pyramidal tract<symptom> ( referred to as VTAndti). In each group of patients , we studied the correlation between the ISE threshold and the VTAn or VTAndti threshold. Fifteen patients were included in the study. In both groups , there was a significant correlation between the VTA intensity threshold and the ISE threshold ( p = 0.018; r = 0.31 for VTAn in the entire study population). In the subset of patients with valid tractography data , the correlation was stronger ( p = 0.002; r = 0.5 for VTAndti). The present study is the first to show a relationship between the intensity threshold as determined by the use of the VTA and the intra-operative side effect threshold. The correlation between the clinical features and the VTA appear stronger when the model was based on a combination of high-resolution anatomic data and interpretable DTI data.
