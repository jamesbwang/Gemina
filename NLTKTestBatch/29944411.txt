 Premenstrual psychosis is a rare phenomenon initiating during or preceding menses , often lasting one to two weeks after the onset of menses. Previous literature shows links between the estrogen decline of the menstrual cycle 's late luteal phase and the worsening of preexisting symptomatology in psychosis. There is thought to be a similar etiology in premenstrual psychosis. Current literature describes mostly clinical cases showing successful treatment using oral contraceptives and/or atypical antipsychotics. We present an adolescent who suffered from a new episode of psychosis beginning just before the onset of menses. Her symptoms<symptom> abated after the completion of menses and with the initiation of combined oral contraceptives and olanzapine.
