 Switching antipsychotic medications is common in patients with schizophrenia who are experiencing persistent symptoms<symptom> or tolerability issues associated with their current drug regimen. This analysis assessed the safety of switching from an oral antipsychotic to the long-acting injectable antipsychotic aripiprazole lauroxil ( AL). This was a post hoc analysis of outpatients with schizophrenia who were prescribed an oral antipsychotic and who enrolled in an international , open-label , long-term ( 52-week) safety study of AL.. The analysis focused on the first 3 injections of AL 882 mg over 12 weeks , divided into the immediate 4-week crossover period between the first and second AL injections ( initiation phase) and the subsequent 8 weeks ( stabilization phase). Patients were grouped by preswitch oral antipsychotic medication , and safety and clinical symptoms<symptom> were assessed. In total , 190 patients had switched from one of the following oral antipsychotic medications: aripiprazole , conventional antipsychotics , risperidone/paliperidone , olanzapine , or quetiapine. The 12-week completion rate was high ( 92.1 %) and similar across the different preswitch oral antipsychotic groups. Overall , adverse event ( AE) rates experienced over 12 weeks were modest; no AEs were considered serious. The most common AEs in the initiation phase were injection site pain ( 5.8 %) , insomnia ( 5.8 %) , and akathisia ( 3.2 %). No apparent relationship was observed between preswitch medication and early-onset AEs. Mean Positive and Negative Syndrome<symptom> Scale total scores remained stable during this period across preswitch antipsychotic groups. Switching from an oral antipsychotic to AL was feasible in an outpatient setting for patients with schizophrenia , and the 12-week retention<symptom> rate was favorable.
