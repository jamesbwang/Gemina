 Despite much focus on moving toward a cure to end the epidemic human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) epidemic there are still thousands of new infections occurring every year in the United States. Although there is ongoing transmission of HIV<pathogen> in the United States and a growing population of people living with HIV<pathogen> , the acute presentation of HIV<pathogen> infection can be challenging to diagnose and is often not considered when patients present to healthcare providers. Although in certain states there are HIV<pathogen> testing laws that require that all persons between the ages of 13 and 64 be offered HIV<pathogen> testing in an opt-out approach , many patient presenting with an acute illness , that would warrant diagnostic testing for HIV<pathogen> , leave without having an HIV<pathogen> test performed for either diagnostic or screening purposes. We describe the case of a woman who presented to medical attention with symptoms<symptom> later confirmed to be due to acute HIV<pathogen> infection. She was initially discharged from the hospital and only underwent HIV<pathogen> testing with confirmation of her diagnosis after readmission. We describe the algorithm where fourth generation testing combined with HIV<pathogen> viral load testing allowed for the diagnosis of acute HIV<pathogen> prior to the development of a specific immunoglobulin response. Consideration of this diagnosis , improved HIV<pathogen> screening , and understanding of the use of antigen/antibody screening tests , combined with Multispot and HIV<pathogen> viral RNA detection , when appropriate , can allow for early diagnosis of HIV<pathogen> before progression of disease<disease> and before undiagnosed patient spread the infection to new contacts.
