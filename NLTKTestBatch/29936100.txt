 Recent literature suggests that children who are vitamin D deficient are uniquely susceptible to the effects of traffic-related air pollution ( TRAP) exposure. This is highly significant because large segments of the population reside in zones of high TRAP exposure. We sought to determine whether vitamin D supplementation mitigates the effect of TRAP exposure on asthma development , asthma exacerbation , and/or airway inflammation<symptom> and to determine the timing of vitamin D supplementation that confers maximal health benefit. Using established mouse models of asthma , we examined the effect of prenatal and postnatal vitamin D supplementation on asthma development , as well as the utility of vitamin D as a treatment for established asthma in the context of diesel exhaust particle ( DEP) exposure. DEP and allergen coexposure resulted in increased airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR) and accumulation of pathogenic T Our data establish that vitamin D confers protection against asthma development specifically in the context of TRAP exposure. Although vitamin D replacement did not reverse established asthma , restoration of normal vitamin D status in early life significantly attenuated the development of AHR in the setting of DEP-exacerbated allergic asthma and reduced numbers of lung T
