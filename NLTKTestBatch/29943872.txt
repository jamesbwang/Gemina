 Stretching highly-contracted plantar flexor muscles ( isokinetic eccentric contractions) results in beneficial adaptations in muscle strain risk factors; however its effects in other muscle groups , and on architectural characteristics and exercise-induced muscle damage ( EIMD) , are unknown. The influence of a 6-week knee extensor training programme was studied in 26 volunteers ( 13 control; 13 experimental). Before and after the training programme , passive and maximal isometric and eccentric knee extensor moments and range of motion ( ROM) were recorded on an isokinetic dynamometer with simultaneous ultrasound imaging of vastus lateralis ( VL). On a separate day , EIMD markers ( creatine kinase ( CK) , delayed onset muscle<symptom> soreness<symptom> ( DOMS)) were measured before and 24 h after a 20-min downhill run. The 6-week training programme was performed twice-weekly where five sets of 12 stretches ( 3 s per stretch) were imposed on maximally contracted knee extensor muscles. Significant ( P < 0.05) increases in eccentric ( 29.5 %) and isometric ( 17.4 %) moments , ROM ( 5.2 Â°) , stretch tolerance ( 55.4 %) , elastic energy storage ( 73.0 %) , VL thickness ( 7.8 %) , pennation angle ( 9.0 %) , and tendon stiffness ( 8.7 %) occurred. No change ( P > 0.05) in passive muscle-tendon stiffness ( -9.4 %) or resting fascicle length ( -0.7 %) occurred. The downhill run resulted in substantial DOMS and significant increase in CK concentration before the training programme ( 107.6 %) , however DOMS was eliminated from the knee extensors and a significantly smaller increase in CK ( -70.0 %) occurred post-training. Conclusion Positive adaptations in functional and physiological variables confirm that imposing stretch on maximally contracted muscle provides beneficial adaptations likely to mitigate EIMD and injury risk and enhance functional performance.
