 The needs of Urban American Indian/Alaska Native ( AI/AN) populations are often not well understood. In order to inform programs and services , the Urban Indian<disease> Center of Salt Lake ( UIC-SL) , in cooperation with researchers from the University of Utah , undertook a community needs assessment of AI/AN living along Utah 's Wasatch Front. A 60-item questionnaire was developed to capture information about health status<symptom> , services used , unmet needs , and common sources of information about AI/AN community events and activities. Study participants ( n = 336) were a convenience sample. Descriptive statistics , including mean , standard deviation , percentage , and 95 % confidence intervals , were calculated. The most common health provider diagnosed medical conditions included hypertension , obesity , and diabetes. The prevalence of violence , substance abuse , and mental health conditions were also high among study participants and their families. Compared to the general Utah population , study participants experienced disparities relative to diabetes prevalence , cognitive and visual disabilities , and access to health care. In addition to health care services , respondents indicated a need for cultural , social , and educational programs. They also reported high levels of technology use , suggesting a possible avenue for communicating with this population. This community-based participatory research project provided rich information about the unmet needs of this urban AI/AN population. The results will be used to guide UIC-SL strategic planning , and a database created for this project will be available for future data collection , allowing for comparison of results between sites and over time.
