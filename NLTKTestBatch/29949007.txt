 Adequate identification of the severity of status<symptom> epilepticus ( SE) contributes to individualized treatment. The scales most widely used for this purpose are: Status<symptom> Epilepticus Severity Score ( STESS) , Epidemiology-Based Mortality Score in Status<symptom> Epilepticus ( EMSE) and modified Rankin Scale STESS ( mRSTESS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the STESS , EMSE and mRSTESS scales to predict high disability and hospital mortality at discharge ( HD/HM). A prospective study was conducted in which total of 41 patients were registered from November 2015 to January 2018 at Eugenio Espejo Hospital. Clinical variables such as age , sex , clinical status<symptom> at the beginning of the SE , initial symptom<symptom> of SE , as well as the STESS , mRSTESS and EMSE variant scales were studied at the time of the diagnosis of SE. A total of 41 patients were evaluated , of which 8 ( 19.5 %) had HD at hospital discharge and died 13 ( 31.7 %) during their care. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to predict HD/HM was 0.71 ( 95 % CI ( confidence interval) 0.55-0.87) , 0.81 ( 95 % CI 0.67-0.94) , 0.89 ( 95 % CI 0.79-0.99) , 0.90 ( 95 % CI 0.80-1.0) , 0.89 ( 95 % CI 0.78-0.99) for the STESS , mRSTESS , EMSE-EAC ( etiology , age , comorbidities) , EMSE-EACEG ( etiology , age , comorbidities , electroencephalography) and EMSE-ECLEG ( etiology , age , level of consciousness<symptom> at pre-treatment , electroencephalography) , variants of EMSE , respectively. The binary logistic regression demonstrated how the following cut-off points were determined: STESS OR ( odd ratio) 4.80 ( p = 0.02) , mRSTESS OR 7.89 ( p = 0.00) , EMSE-EAC OR 22.16 ( p = 0.00) , EMSE-ECLEG OR 18.00 ( p = 0.00) , EMSE-EACEG OR 14 ( p = 0.00). All of the evaluated scales ( STESS , mRSTESS , and EMSE) were shown to be useful in predicting HD/HM. EMSE was observed to be the most effective of the scales , with relative similarities among the variants.
