 To study the prevalence and the clinical and demographic associations of hypovitaminosis D in pregnant women from southern Brazil. In this cross-sectional study , pregnant women attending prenatal care at two university clinics in Curitiba , Brazil , were investigated for clinical and demographic data and for serum levels of vitamin D , calcium , and parathyroid hormone. Data were collected during summer ( January 26 to March 4 , 2016) or winter ( July 28 to August 31 , 2016). The study included 520 women , with 264 studied in winter and 256 in summer. The median vitamin D level was 53.41 nmol/L; 227 ( 43.7 %) women had vitamin D deficiency ( < 49.92 nmol/L) , 193 ( 37.1 %) had vitamin D insufficiency , and 100 ( 19.2 %) had a normal level ( â‰¥ 74.88 nmol/L). The vitamin D serum level was linked to the season ( P < 0.001) and the body mass index ( P = 0.026). Women with HIV<pathogen> infections<disease> had a lower prevalence and women with pre-eclampsia had a higher prevalence of hypovitaminosis D ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.025 , respectively). The association between pre-eclampsia and low vitamin D status<symptom> was independent of body mass index , tobacco exposure , maternal age , and pregnancy duration ( P = 0.043; odds ratio 1.014-2.795). The rate of hypovitaminosis D in pregnant women from southern Brazil was high. Hypovitaminosis D was more common in winter and was associated with pre-eclampsia.
