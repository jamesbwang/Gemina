 The main objective of this study was a detailed comparison of the level of anxiety<symptom> about surgery and anesthesia. Other objectives included the assessment of the prevalence and intensity of preoperative anxiety<symptom>. This cross-sectional single-center survey used the validated Amsterdam anxiety<symptom> and information scale ( APAIS) and a modified numeric rating scale ( mNRS) to assess preoperative anxiety<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> about surgery and anxiety<symptom> about anesthesia. Prevalences and intensities of anxieties were predominantly analyzed descriptively. 3200 patients were enrolled and 3087 ( 57 % females) were analyzed. 92.6 % reported preoperative anxiety<symptom> according to APAIS scores. The average total APAIS anxiety<symptom> score ( APAIS-A-T) was 9.9 ( SD 3.6). 40.5 % reported high anxiety<symptom> ( defined as APAIS-A-T > 10). Mean anxiety<symptom> about surgery ( APAIS-A-Su) was higher than mean anxiety<symptom> about anesthesia ( APAIS-A-An): 5.5 ( SD 2.1) vs. 4.3 ( SD 1.9) , p < 0.0001. Accordingly , more patients were substantially more afraid ( score difference > 2) of surgery ( 642 , 20.8 % , 95 % CI 19.4-22.3) than of anesthesia ( 48 , 1.6 % , 95 % CI 1.2-2.1). Preoperative anxiety<symptom> is still very common among adult patients scheduled to undergo an elective procedure. Therefore , it should be evaluated routinely. Anxiety<symptom> about surgery and anxiety<symptom> about anesthesia differ in many patients. For this reason , anxiety<symptom> about surgery and anxiety<symptom> about anesthesia should be assessed separately. This would allow providing a more individualized support of patients to cope with their anxiety<symptom> and could require particular attention by the surgeon or the anesthetist.
