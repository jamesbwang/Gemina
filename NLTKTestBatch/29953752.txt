 Skeletal muscle index ( SMI) and the controlling nutritional status<symptom> ( CONUT) score are useful for evaluating nutritional status<symptom> , which is closely associated with cancer prognosis. This study compared the prognostic value of these indicators in patients with gastric cancer ( GC) after radical gastrectomy ( RG). We retrospectively enrolled 532 patients between 2010 and 2011. SMI was measured via CT images to determine low SMI. The CONUT score was calculated based on serum albumin , total lymphocyte<symptom> count , and cholesterol. Patients were grouped according to SMI and the CONUT score based on previous research. Spearman 's correlation coefficient , the Kaplan-Meier method , and Cox regression were used. There was no significant correlation between SMI and the CONUT score. Five-year overall survival ( OS) and recurrence-free survival ( RFS) in patients with low SMI were significantly worse than those in patients with high SMI ( P < .001). The normal nutrition group had better OS and RFS than did the light and moderate or severe malnutrition groups ( P < .05) , but the OS and RFS were not significantly different between the light and moderate or severe malnutrition groups ( P = .726). Univariate analysis showed that SMI and the CONUT score were associated with OS and RFS , but only SMI remained prognostic in multivariate analysis. Preoperative SMI based on CT images is a more objective predictor than the CONUT score of long-term survival in GC after RG , but this finding must be confirmed by prospective trials.
