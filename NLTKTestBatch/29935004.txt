 Postprandial hyperglycemia is frequently accompanied by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease<disease> ( NAFLD) and steatohepatitis ( NASH). Although α-glucosidase inhibitors ( αGIs) can slow glucose absorption from the intestine and suppress the surge of circulating glucose concentration after meals , it remains unclear whether αGIs are also beneficial for NASH. The aim of this prospective study was to examine the efficacy and safety of miglitol , a typical αGI , for NASH. Seventeen patients with histologically confirmed NASH and hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) > 6.5 % were treated with miglitol ( 150 mg/day) for 12 months. The changes in clinical parameters and liver histology were analyzed. All patients completed the 12-month miglitol treatment course with no severe adverse events. The treatment significantly decreased body mass index , serum alanine aminotransferase levels , and HbA1c ( all P < 0.001). Post-treatment liver biopsy of 11 patients revealed significant improvements in steatosis ( from 2.2 ± 0.6 to 1.5 ± 0.7 , P = 0.001) , lobular inflammation<symptom> ( from 1.8 ± 0.8 to 1.3 ± 0.5 , P = 0.014) , portal inflammation<symptom> scores ( from 0.6 ± 0.5 to 0.1 ± 0.3 , P = 0.025) , and NAFLD activity score ( from 5.5 ± 1.5 to 3.9 ± 1.4 , P = 0.012). Fibrosis<disease> and hepatocyte ballooning scores were unchanged. Miglitol appears to safely ameliorate NASH activity by attenuation of steatosis and lobular/portal inflammation<symptom>. Appropriately powered controlled trials are warranted to validate our results.
