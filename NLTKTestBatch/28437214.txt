 Gender inequality persists in many professions , particularly in high-status fields , such as science , technology , engineering , and math. We report evidence of a form of gender bias that may contribute to this state: gender influences the way that people speak about professionals. When discussing professionals or their work , it is common to refer to them by surname alone ( e.g. , `` Darwin developed the theory of evolution ''). We present evidence that people are more likely to refer to male than female professionals in this way. This gender bias emerges in archival data across domains; students reviewing professors online and pundits discussing politicians on the radio are more likely to use surname when speaking about a man ( vs. a woman). Participants ' self-reported references also indicate a preference for using surname when speaking about male ( vs. female) scientists , authors , and others. Finally , experimental evidence provides convergent evidence: participants writing about a fictional male scientist are more likely to refer to him by surname than participants writing about an otherwise identical female scientist. We find that , on average , people are over twice as likely to refer to male professionals by surname than female professionals. Critically , we identified consequences of this gender bias in speaking about professionals. Researchers referred to by surname are judged as more famous and eminent. They are consequently seen as higher status<symptom> and more deserving of eminence-related benefits and awards. For instance , scientists referred to by surname were seen as 14 % more deserving of a National Science Foundation career award.
