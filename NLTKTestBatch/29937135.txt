 We reviewed the indications for endometrial biopsy at the general gynaecology outpatient clinic of the Université de Montréal Hospital Center and measured their compliance with the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada and other international guidelines. Three hundred and seventy-one files of patients who had an endometrial biopsy between January and October 2015 were reviewed. Indication for endometrial biopsy and pathology results were noted. Files were separated into four categories. In the postmenopausal bleeding category , all files complied with the SOGC. We found hyperplasia<disease> or neoplasia in 13 % of patients. In the asymptomatic endometrial thickening category , 9 % of the files did not show sufficient indication for biopsy. None of the patients presented hyperplasia<disease> or neoplasia. In the abnormal uterine bleeding ( AUB)- under 41 years old category , there was no indication for biopsy in 23 % of the files. We found hyperplasia<disease> or neoplasia in 13 % of patients , but only in patients with an indication for biopsy. In patients with AUB- over 40 , non-compliance with SOGC was 3 %. But according to international guidelines , 42 % of patients with AUB between 41 and 45 years old did not have an indication for biopsy and none showed hyperplasia<disease> or neoplasia. We demonstrated clinically significant overinvestigation in patients with AUB. Indications should be reviewed carefully before performing an endometrial biopsy in women under 41. In addition , the value of endometrial biopsies in patients between 41 and 45 years old with menorrhagia<symptom> and no additional risk factor should be reevaluated.
