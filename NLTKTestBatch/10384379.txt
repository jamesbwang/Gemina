 Cobalamin C ( cblC) deficiency is the most commonly inherited inborn error of vitamin B12 metabolism. It is characterized by multisystem involvement with severe<symptom> neurological , hematological , renal and cardiopulmonary manifestations. Disease<disease> is most commonly diagnosed early in the first decade of life. We report a case of a 20-year-old woman who developed severe<symptom> pulmonary arterial hypertension while under nephrologic follow-up for chronic kidney disease<disease>. She had initially presented at 14 years of age with visual disturbance and acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and been diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura on the basis of kidney biopsy findings of thrombotic microangiopathy and compatible ADAMTS13 ( a disentegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif member 13). When cblC deficiency was eventually diagnosed , remarkable improvement in cardiopulmonary function was evident upon initiation of treatment. This case highlights the importance of a timely diagnosis and initiation of treatment for cblC deficiency. Clinical diagnosis may be challenged by asynchronous organ symptom<symptom> presentation and by misleading laboratory tests , in this case: an initial low ADAMTS13. A simple test of plasma homocysteine level should be encouraged in cases of thrombotic microangiopathy and/or pulmonary artery hypertension.
