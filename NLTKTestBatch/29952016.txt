 Metastatic Crohn 's disease<disease> is a rare cutaneous complication of primary Crohn 's disease<disease>. It is a granulomatous inflammatory process , similar to the pathogenic mechanism of Crohn 's disease<disease> , that occurs in sites discontiguous from the gastrointestinal tract<symptom>. Metastatic Crohn 's disease<disease> can precede the development of Crohn 's disease<disease> by months to years , and children are more likely to present with metastatic Crohn 's disease<disease> in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms<symptom>. Given that approximately 30 % of individuals with Crohn 's disease<disease> present in childhood , early recognition of extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn 's disease<disease> such as metastatic Crohn 's disease<disease> can aid in timely diagnosis and management of bowel disease<disease>. We present data from two pediatric cases of metastatic Crohn 's disease<disease> recently seen at our institution in addition to the 61 reported cases of pediatric metastatic Crohn 's disease<disease> in the literature. This review article will focus on the epidemiology , pathogenesis , clinical features , and histology of and treatment options for pediatric metastatic Crohn 's disease<disease>.
