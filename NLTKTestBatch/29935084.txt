 Peripheral nerve defect is a common and severe kind of injury in traumatic accidents. Melatonin can improve peripheral nerve recovery by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> after traumatic insults. In addition , it triggers autophagy pathways to increase regenerated nerve proliferation and to reduce apoptosis. In this study , we fabricated a melatonin-controlled-release scaffold to cure long-range nerve defects for the first time. 3D manufacture of melatonin/polycaprolactone nerve guide conduit increased Schwann cell proliferation and neural expression in vitro and promoted functional , electrophysiological and morphological nerve regeneration in vivo. Melatonin nerve guide conduit ameliorated immune milieu by reducing oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition , it activated autophagy to restore ideal microenvironment , to provide energy for nerves<symptom> and to reduce nerve cell apoptosis , thus facilitating nerve debris clearance and neural proliferation. This innovative scaffold will have huge significance in the nerve engineering. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
