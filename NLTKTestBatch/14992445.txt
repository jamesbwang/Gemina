 The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> and antibiotic therapy on intestinal microbiota composition and intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in children and adolescents. A cross-sectional controlled study was conducted with 36 children and adolescents: 19 in the cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> group ( CFG) and 17 in the control group ( CG) matched for age and sex. The CFG was subdivided based on the use of antibiotic therapy ( CFAB group) and non-use of antibiotic therapy ( CFnAB group). The following data were evaluated: colonization , antibiotic therapy , mutation , breastfeeding , use of infant formula , type of delivery , introduction of solid foods , body mass index , fecal calprotectin and intestinal microbiota composition ( fluorescence in situ hybridization). Intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> evaluated by fecal calprotectin was significantly higher in the CFG ( median: 40.80 µg/g , IQR: 19.80-87.10 , p = 0.040) and CFAB group ( median: 62.95 µg/g , IQR: 21.80-136.62 , p = 0.045) compared to the CG ( median: 20.15 µg/g , IQR: 16.20-31.00) , and the Bacteroides , Firmicutes , Eubacterium<pathogen> rectale<pathogen> and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly decreased ( p < 0.05) in the CFG compared to the CG , whereas the bacteria<pathogen> Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> , Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> were significantly increased in the CFG ( p < 0.05). The main differences were found between the CG and CFAB group for Eubacterium<pathogen> rectale<pathogen> ( p = 0.006) , Bifidobacterium<pathogen> ( p = 0.017) , Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( p = 0.030) , Firmicutes ( p = 0.002) , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> ( p < 0.001) and Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> ( p = 0.006). The results of this study confirm intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in patients with CF , which may be related to changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota.
