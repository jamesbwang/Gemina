 Mycoplasma<pathogen> hyorhinis is an important pathogen of swine that can often occur as a respiratory coinfection with viral pathogens , but can also cause arthritis<disease><symptom> and polyserositis in infected animals. To date , no assay is available to assess the serologic response to M. hyorhinis vaccines , to our knowledge. We used recombinantly expressed M. hyorhinis p37 protein to monitor the magnitude of the IgG response in vaccinated animals. The assay was able to distinguish animals vaccinated with M. hyorhinis from those vaccinated with the other important Mycoplasma<pathogen> species: M. hyopneumoniae and M. hyosynoviae. When formulated with an ideal adjuvant , inactivated vaccines designed to protect animals against M. hyorhinis induced a measurable and dose-dependent antibody response against the p37 protein. Additionally , the protein appears to be highly conserved between strains of M. hyorhinis isolated in the United States. The specificity of the assay as well as the conservation and immunogenicity of the p37 protein make it an ideal candidate antigen for use in measuring the immune response against M. hyorhinis after vaccination in weaned pigs.
