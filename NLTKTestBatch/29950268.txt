 A right-sided ventriculoperitoneal ( VP) shunt was placed in patient with congenital hydrocephalous in the first month of life. Three-month review visit showed no improvement and after evaluation and computerised tomogram ( CT) scan brain , another VP shunt was placed on the left side without handling the previous right<symptom> sided VP shunt. Patient did not improve and again presented with fever<symptom> and fits. CT scan brain with and without contrast was repeated , which showed bilateral subdural empyema<disease> and right-sided cranially migrated VP shunt. Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) analysis demonstrated infection<disease>. Bilateral burr hole drainage of subdural empyema<disease> with subsequent removal of right-sided migrated VP shunt was done. Cranial end of left-sided VP shunt was converted into external ventricular drain ( EVD) and its abdominal end removed. Patient was placed on intravenous as well as intraventricular antibiotics through the EVD. Later , right-sided VP shunt was placed after clearance of infection<disease>. Regular follow-up showed that the patient is doing well.
