 To examine the association between myocardial fat , a poorly understood finding frequently observed on non-contrast CT , and all-cause mortality in patients with and without a history of prior MI. A retrospective cohort from a diverse urban academic center was derived from chronic myocardial infarction ( MI) patients ( n = 265) and three age-matched patients without MI ( n = 690) who underwent non-contrast chest CT between 1 January 2005-31 December 2008. CT images were reviewed for left and right ventricular fat. Electronic records identified clinical variables. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses assessed the association between myocardial fat and all-cause mortality. The net reclassification improvement assessed the utility of adding myocardial fat to traditional risk prediction models. Mortality was 40.1 % for the no MI and 71.7 % for the MI groups ( median follow-up , 6.8 years; mean age , 73.7 ± 10.6 years). In the no MI group , 25.7 % had LV and 49.9 % RV fat. In the MI group , 32.8 % had LV and 42.3 % RV fat. LV and RV fat was highly associated ( OR 5.3 , p < 0.001). Ventricular fat was not associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Myocardial fat was associated with a reduction in the adjusted hazard of death for both the no MI ( 25 % , p = 0.04) and the MI group ( 31 % , p = 0.018). Myocardial fat resulted in the correct reclassification of 22 % for the no MI group versus the Charlson score or calcium score ( p = 0.004) and 47 % for the MI group versus the Charlson score ( p = 0.0006). Patients with myocardial fat have better survival , regardless of MI status<symptom> , suggesting that myocardial fat is a beneficial biomarker and may improve risk stratification. • Myocardial fat is commonly found on chest CT , yet is poorly understood • Myocardial fat is associated with better survival in patients with and without prior MI and is not associated with traditional cardiovascular risk factors • This finding may provide clinically meaningful prognostic value in the risk stratification of patients.
