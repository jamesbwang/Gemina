 A 41-year-old man presented to us with left arm and leg<symptom> weakness<symptom> and mild word finding difficulties. His preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) demonstrated abnormal T1 and T2 signal changes in the right temporal lobe and basal ganglia , indicative of possible glioma. An awake craniotomy for right temporal lobectomy was performed and the tumor was resected. Full pathologic workup later revealed the patient had two distinct tumors occurring simultaneously , anaplastic astrocytoma and astroblastoma. We review the literature regarding the treatment of anaplastic astrocytoma and astroblastoma and discuss their co-occurrence.
