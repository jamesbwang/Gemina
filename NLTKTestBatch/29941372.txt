 After the widespread introduction of single-use liquid laundry detergent packs ( LLDPs) , a prospective observational study was initiated among 12 U.S. poison control centers ( PCCs) , serving 25 % of the population. To evaluate qualitative and quantitative data , including demographics , route of exposure , clinical effects , medical outcome , management site , level of care , and circumstantial variables surrounding the LLDP exposure. Analysis of LLDP exposures involving children ( age < 6 years) reported to PCCs participating in the prospective study ( March 2012-February 2016). PCCs captured a detailed exposure history and followed each patient to symptom<symptom> resolution. Each case narrative was reviewed to isolate key patient , product , and situational variables and to verify accuracy of coded data. Trend and comparative analyses were performed on absolute case counts , relative proportions , and reporting rates normalized using Nielsen consumption data. Separately , the impact of exposure reduction interventions introduced by a single manufacturer were assessed by comparing reporting rate during pre-/ postintervention periods. There were 11,175 childhood exposures reported , with 90.3 % involving children aged ≤ 3 years. Ingestion ( 82.6 %) and ocular ( 14.2 %) were the major routes of exposure. The size of the market for LLDPs more than doubled from ∼ 2.0 to ∼ 4.6 million LLDPs purchased. Total exposure reports increased from Year 1 ( n = 2297) to Year 4 ( n = 3206) , however , normalized reporting rates dropped by 37 % ( 4.4 to 2.8 exp/million LLDPs purchased). Significant declines ( p < 0.0001) were also observed for ingestions and ocular exposures with major/moderate outcome. There was a significant reduction in exposures that resulted in major/moderate outcomes , and the majority of patients did not require intervention in an emergency department setting.
