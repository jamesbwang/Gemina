 Airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages ( AMs) are the first line of defense in the lung during infection. Toll-like receptor ( TLR) agonists have been extensively used to define the regulation of inflammation<symptom> in these cells. However , previous studies were performed in non-paired airway epithelial cells and AMs. The major goal of our study was to compare the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses of paired human primary airway epithelial cells and AMs to TLR3 and TLR4 agonists. Tracheobronchial epithelial cells ( TBEC) and AMs from four smokers and four non-smokers without lung disease<disease> were cultured with or without Poly ( I: C) ( PIC) ( a TLR3 agonist) or LPS ( a TLR4 agonist) for 4 , 24 and 48 h. The immune responses of paired cells were compared. TBEC and AMs showed stronger pro-inflammatory cytokine ( e.g. , IL-8) responses to PIC and LPS , respectively. TLR3 and TLR4 mRNA levels were similar in non-stimulated TBEC and AMs. However , PIC stimulation in AMs led to sustained up-regulation of the immune negative regulators Tollip and A20 , which may render AMs less sensitive to PIC stimulation than TBEC. Unlike AMs , TBEC did not increase NF-ÎºB activation after LPS stimulation. Interestingly , smoking status was correlated with less TLR3 and IRAK-M expression in non-stimulated TBEC , but not in AMs. PIC-stimulated TBEC and LPS-stimulated AMs from smokers vs. non-smokers produced more IL-8. Finally , we show that expression of A20 and IRAK-M is strongly correlated in the two paired cell types. By using paired airway epithelial cells and AMs , this study reveals how these two critical types of lung cells respond to viral and bacterial pathogen associated molecular patterns , and provides rationale for modulating immune negative regulators to prevent excessive lung inflammation<symptom> during respiratory<disease> infection<disease>.
