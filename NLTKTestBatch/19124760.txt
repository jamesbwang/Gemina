 Diabetic neuropathy ( DN) is a frequent and debilitating manifestation of diabetes mellitus , to which there are no effective therapeutic approaches. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ( MSC) have a great potential for the treatment of this syndrome<symptom> , possibly through regenerative actions on peripheral nerves<symptom>. Here , we evaluated the therapeutic effects of MSC on spinal neuroinflammation , as well as on ultrastructural aspects of the peripheral nerve in DN-associated sensorial dysfunction. C57Bl/6 mice were treated with bone marrow-derived MSC ( 1 × 10 Diabetic mice presented behavioral signs of sensory neuropathy , mechanical allodynia , and heat hypoalgesia , which were completely reversed by a single administration of MSC or CM-MSC. The ultrastructural analysis of the sciatic nerve showed that diabetic mice exhibited morphological and morphometric alterations , considered hallmarks of DN , such as degenerative changes in axons and myelin sheath , and reduced area and density of unmyelinated fibers. In MSC-treated mice , these structural alterations were markedly less commonly observed and/or less pronounced. Moreover , MSC transplantation inhibited multiple parameters of spinal neuroinflammation found in diabetic mice , causing the reduction of activated astrocytes and microglia , oxidative stress signals , galectin-3 , IL-1β , and TNF-α production. Conversely , MSC increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines , IL-10 , and TGF-β. The present study described the modulatory effects of MSC on spinal<disease> cord neuroinflammation in diabetic mice , suggesting new mechanisms by which MSC can improve DN.
