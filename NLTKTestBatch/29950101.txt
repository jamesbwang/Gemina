 Prenatal and perinatal factors may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. However , little is known about whether unaffected siblings of probands with autism spectrum disorder also share the phenomenon and whether the prenatal/perinatal factors are related to the clinical severity of autistic symptoms<symptom>. We compared the frequency of prenatal and perinatal factors among 323 probands with autism spectrum disorder ( mean age ± standard deviation , 10.7 ± 3.5 years; males , 91.0 %) , 257 unaffected siblings ( 11.7 ± 4.5; 42.8 %) , and 1504 typically developing controls ( 8.9 ± 1.6 years; 53.1 %); and investigated their effects on the severity of autistic symptoms<symptom>. We found that probands with autism spectrum disorder and their unaffected siblings had more prenatal/perinatal events than typically developing controls with higher numbers of prenatal/perinatal factors in probands than in unaffected siblings. The prenatal/perinatal events were associated with greater stereotyped behaviors , social-emotional problems , socio-communication deficits , and overall severity. We also found that six prenatal/perinatal factors ( i.e. preeclampsia , polyhydramnios , oligoamnios , placenta previa , umbilical cord knot , and gestational diabetes) were associated with the severity of autistic symptoms<symptom> , particularly stereotyped behaviors and socio-communication deficits. Our findings suggest that prenatal and perinatal factors may potentially moderate the clinical expression of autism spectrum disorder. The underlying mechanism warrants further research.
