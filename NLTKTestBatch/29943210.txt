 To provide an update on the pathogenesis of enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma ( EATL) and its relationship with refractory celiac disease<disease> ( RCD) , in light of current knowledge of immune , genetic , and environmental factors that promote neoplastic transformation of intraepithelial lymphocytes ( IELs). EATL frequently evolves from RCD type II ( RCD II) but can occur `` de novo '' in individuals with celiac disease<disease>. Recurrent activating mutations in members of the JAK/STAT pathway have been recently described in EATL and RCD II , which suggests deregulation of cytokine signaling to be an early event in lymphomagenesis. Intraepithelial T cells are presumed to be the cell of origin of EATL ( and RCD II). Recent in vitro molecular and phenotypic analyses and in vivo murine studies , however , suggest an origin of RCD II from innate IELs ( NK/T cell precursors) , which could also be the cell of origin of RCD II-derived EATL. The immune microenvironment of the small intestinal mucosa<pathogen><symptom> in celiac disease<disease> fosters the development of EATL , often in a multistep pathway.
