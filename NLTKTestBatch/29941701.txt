 To determine the incidence of hypertension among children during the induction and re-induction phases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) therapy and association with possible risk factors. A retrospective analysis of 208 consecutive pediatric ( age < 18 y) ALL patients , treated per BFM-95 protocol from January 2009 and December 2013. Demographics , disease<disease> , treatment and toxicity data were abstracted from medical records and were analyzed to determine the incidence of hypertension and risk factors for its development. Incidence of hypertension requiring antihypertensive medication , was 29 % ( 61/208) during induction and 17 % ( 33/198) during re-induction ( P = 0.003). Median ( range) age of patients developing hypertension was 4 years ( 4 months to 8 years). Age < 10 years and presence of constipation<symptom> were independently predictive of hypertension by both univariate and multivariate analysis. The present study reports a high incidence of hypertension among children undergoing ALL induction therapy and its strong association with young age and constipation<symptom>.
