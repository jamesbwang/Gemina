 According to the European Occupational Diseases Statistics ( EODS-2005) diseases<disease> related with musculoskeletal disorders occupy the first position on the obligatory list of occupational diseases<disease>. These disorders most frequently occur in the agriculture-hunting-forestry sector in such countries as: Finland , Holland , Germany , France and Spain ( data: EU-OSHA). The study included a selected group of males- 414 forestry workers , employees of the State Forests , aged 25-65 , mean age 48. The control group were 119 office workers aged 23-64 , mean age 45.8. The basic research instrument was a questionnaire designed by specialists concerning pain complaints occurring in 7 areas of the motor system: neck , arms<symptom> , upper and lower back , hips<symptom> , knees and feet. The results of the survey showed that in the selected group of forestry workers , among 7 investigated areas of the motor system , the most frequently reported pain complaints involved the lower part of the spine ( 272 persons , 65.7 % of the total number of respondents). In the control group such pain complaints occurred in 55.5 % ( 66) of office workers ( p = 0.04). Forestry workers most often described this pain as permanent , radiating to the leg , or as an acute<symptom> pain<symptom>. According to the frequency of reporting pain , the area of the knees was placed on the second position ( 214 foresters; 51.7 %). The work of a forester which consist , among other things , in relocation on foot or by vehicle over long distances along an uneven terrain and in various weather conditions , is a risk factor of the occurrence of musculosceletal disorders concerning the low<symptom> back and knees.
