 Incretin-based drugs are important in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However , among the incretin-based drugs , glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists ( GLP-1-RAs) have been reported to cause gastroesophageal reflux disease<disease> ( GERD)- like symptoms<symptom> making it difficult to continue treatment. Therefore , with the aim of clarifying the relationship between incretin-based drugs and GERD-like symptoms<symptom> , we conducted a pharmacoepidemiological study using the Japanese adverse drug event report database ( JADER). Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors ( DPP-4-Is) and GLP-1-RAs were set as the incretin-based target drugs. The reporting odds ratio ( ROR) and the information component ( IC) was used for the detection of quantitative signals. Furthermore , we also compared the time to onset of GERD-like symptoms<symptom> by log-rank test. GERD-like symptoms<symptom> were reported in 36 GLP-1-RAs cases ( ROR: 5.61 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI): 3.95-7.96 and IC: 2.17 , 95 % CI: 1.66-2.67) and GLP-1-RAs were detected in the signal. In contrast , DPP-4-Is were not detected in the signal.There was no sex difference with regard to the expression time of GERD-like symptoms<symptom> by GLP-1-RAs ( log-rank test , The administration of GLP-1-RA had a higher incidence of GERD-like symptoms<symptom> earlier than the administration of DPP-4-Is. In this study , although we think that further investigation is necessary , and suggest that patients older than 70 years of age who have been administered GLP-1-RAs need earlier attention to address GERD-like symptoms<symptom> than younger patients.
