 Psoriasis is an autoimmune , inflammatory disorder characterized by proliferation of keratinocytes , and it may be associated with a systemic inflammatory articular disorder , psoriatic arthritis<disease>. The presentations of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis<disease> are heterogeneous , and our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis has led to a better understanding of the vital role of the IL-23/ Th17 immune axis. Areas covered: Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-12 and IL-23 , and this review will focus on its role in the management of psoriatic disease<disease>. The pathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis<disease> is a multifactorial process involving genetic , environmental , and lifestyle factors. IL-23 signaling and activation of Th17 cells leads to a self-perpetuating inflammatory loop resulting in continuous keratinocyte proliferation and synovitis<symptom>. Treatment options are varied , ranging from topical therapy to injection<symptom> of targeted biologic DMARDs. Evidence on the use of ustekinumab in the management of psoriasis is strong , but it is not as impressive in management of psoriatic arthritis<disease>. Expert Opinion: IL-12/ 23 inhibition appears to be a good first line option for plaque psoriasis , but efficacy in psoriatic arthritis<disease> does not compare favorably to IL-17 inhibition. In general , poorer responses to therapy with any biologic DMARD in psoriatic arthritis<disease> cohorts highlight psoriatic disease<disease> heterogeneity. Until new knowledge can remedy the failure of monotherapy , synergistic methods may have to be explored , including combination biologic therapy.
