 Hemangiomas are the most common congenital vascular and benign tumor in infants and children. Most hemangiomas do not cause major symptoms<symptom> to require intervention , however , the larger hemangiomas have tendency to bleed and may require surgical removal. Experimental studies have demonstrated the role of urokinase plasminogen activator ( u-PA) , especially cell surface u-PA , as an initiator of extra-cellular matrix proteolysis and associated tumor cell invasion. To examine , whether the antitumor effects of a specific nutrient mixture are due to induction of apoptosis by inhibition of u-PA. A nutrient mixture containing lysine , proline , ascorbic acid , and green tea extract which has showed anticancer activity against a number of cancer cell lines was used as an experimental composition. EOMA cells were grown in appropriate media with antibiotics in 24-well tissue culture plates. At near confluence , the cells were treated with nutrition mixture at 10 , 100 , 1000 µg/ml in triplicate. Analysis of u-PA activity was carried out by fibrin zymography. Morphological changes and caspase activation associated with apoptosis induction was checked by H&E staining and Live Green<symptom> caspase assay , respectively. Apoptosis inducing anticancer drug camptothecin ( 10 µM) was used as positive control. The nutrition mixture exhibited dose response toxicity with maximum toxicity 55 % ( p < 0.001) at 1000 µg/ml. EOMA cells expressed u-PA , which was inhibited by nutrition mixture in a dose-dependent manner. The caspase analysis revealed a dose dependent increase in apoptosis of EOMA hemangioma cells , with an increasing apoptosis observed at 100 μg/ml , and maximum at 1000 μg/ml. Cells treated with nutrition mixture showed significantly more apoptotic changes than the control or camptothecin-treated cells. These results suggest that NM may induce apoptosis of hemangioma cells in vitro thus warranting further investigation.
