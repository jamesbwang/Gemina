 Although the eighth-edition American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC) gastric cancer staging system created ypTNM staging for patients who underwent preoperative therapy , the ideal ypTNM grouping is unknown. We sought to investigate risk factors for OS in ypT0-3N0M0 gastric cancer. From an institutional database of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the National Cancer Database ( NCDB) , we identified patients with ypT0-3N0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent R0 gastrectomy after chemotherapy or chemoradiation during 1995-2015 ( MD Anderson) or 2006-2014 ( NCDB). The study included 175 MD Anderson and 3200 NCDB patients. By multivariable analysis , ypT category was not associated with OS ( hazard ratio ( HR) for ypT3 vs ypT1: MD Anderson , 0.83 ( 95 % CI , 0.36-1.92) , P = 0.669; NCDB , 0.96 ( 95 % CI , 0.85-1.08) , P = 0.472). cN-positive disease<disease> was not associated with OS in the MD Anderson cohort ( HR , 0.96 ( 95 % CI , 0.55-1.67); P = 0.873) but was weakly associated with shorter OS in the NCDB cohort ( HR , 1.11 ( 95 % CI , 1.01-1.21); P = 0.031). The ypT category does not impact OS in ypT0-3N0M0 gastric cancer. The impact of cN status<symptom> on OS appeared limited. These findings should be considered in future systems of post-neoadjuvant pathologic staging.
