 Foot and ankle deformities are common orthopaedic disorders in children with Down syndrome<symptom>. However , radiographic measurements of the foot and ankle have not been previously reported. The aim of this study is to describe the foot and ankle deformity in children with Down syndrome<symptom>. Children who had foot and ankle radiographs in the standing weight-bearing position were selected. Three groups of patients were identified. The relationship of radiographic measurements with age , body mass index and pain<symptom> is discussed. In all , 41 children ( 79 feet) had foot radiographs and 60 children ( 117 ankles<symptom>) had ankle radiographs , with 15 children overlapping between Groups I and II. In Group I , hallux valgus deformity was seen before ten years of age and hallux valgus angle increased afterwards. Metatarsus adductus angle showed a significant increase ( p = 0.006) with obesity and was higher in patients who had foot pain ( p = 0.05). In Group II , none of the ankle measurements showed a significant difference with age or body mass index percentiles. Tibiotalar angle ( TTA) and medial distal tibial angle ( MDTA) were higher in patients who had ankle<symptom> pain<symptom>. In Group III , correlation analysis was performed between the different measurements with the strongest correlations found between TTA and MDTA. In children with Down syndrome<symptom> , radiographic evaluation of the foot and ankle reveals higher prevalence of deformities than clinical examination. However , foot and ankle radiographs are needed only for symptomatic children with pain and gait changes. Level IV- Prognostic Study.
