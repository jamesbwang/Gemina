 Guideline compliant CPR is associated with improved survival for patients with cardiac arrest. Conventional Basic Life Support ( BLS) training results in suboptimal CPR competency and skill retention<symptom>. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of distributed CPR training with real-time feedback to conventional BLS training for CPR skills in pediatric healthcare providers. Healthcare providers were randomized into receiving annual BLS training ( control) or distributed training with real-time feedback ( intervention). The intervention group was asked to practice CPR for 2 min on mannequins while receiving real-time CPR feedback , at least once per month. Control group participants were not asked to practice CPR during the study period. Excellent CPR was defined as 90 % guideline-compliance for depth , rate and recoil of chest compressions. CPR performance of participants was assessed ( on infant and adult-sized mannequins) every 3 months for a duration of 12 months. CPR performance was compared between the 2 groups. A total of 87 healthcare providers were included in the analyses ( control n = 41 , intervention n = 46). Baseline assessment showed no significant difference in CPR performance across the 2 groups. The intervention group has a significantly greater proportion of participants with excellent CPR compared with the control group on an adult sized mannequin ( 14.6 % vs. 54.3 % , p < 0.001) and infant-sized mannequin ( 19.5 % vs. 71.7 % , p < 0.001) at the end of the study. In the intervention group , all CPR metrics except infant depth were improved and retained over the course of the study. Distributed CPR training with real-time feedback improves the compliance of AHA guidelines of quality of CPR.
