 The DNA damage response system ( DDR) is crucial in addressing DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs) , which pose a severe threat to genomic integrity. The SOG1 transcription factor is a master regulator of the Arabidopsis thaliana DDR. We previously showed that hyperphosphorylation of five Ser-Gln sites of SOG1 is the molecular switch to activate the DDR. In this study , we determined that SOG1 is hyperphosphorylated within 20 minutes following DSB-inducing treatment , followed by activation of several SOG1 target genes. Using SOG1 phosphorylation mutants , we demonstrated that although the hyperphosphorylation sites remain unchanged over time , the amount of hyperphosphorylation gradually increases. These observations suggest that rapid SOG1 hyperphosphorylation is limited by the amount of active kinases.
