 Minimal Change Disease<disease> ( MCD) is a clinical condition characterized by acute nephrotic syndrome<symptom> , no evident renal lesions<symptom> at histology and good response to steroids. However , frequent recurrence of the disease<disease> requires additional therapies associated with steroids. Such multi-drug dependence and frequent relapses may cause disease<disease> evolution to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS) over time. The differences between the two conditions are not well defined , since molecular mechanisms may be shared by the two diseases<disease>. In some cases , genetic analysis can make it possible to distinguish MCD from FSGS; however , there are cases of overlap. Several hypotheses on mechanisms underlying MCD and potential molecular triggers have been proposed. Most studies were conducted on animal models of proteinuria<symptom> that partially mimic MCD and may be useful to study glomerulosclerosis evolution; however , they do not demonstrate a clear-cut separation between MCD and FSGS. Puromycin Aminonucleoside and Adriamycin nephrosis are models of glomerular oxidative damage , characterized by loss of glomerular basement membrane polyanions resembling MCD at the onset and , at more advanced stages , by glomerulosclerosis resembling FSGS. Also Buffalo/Mna rats present initial lesions<symptom> of MCD , subsequently evolving to FSGS; this mechanism of renal damage is clearer since this rat strain inherits the unique characteristic of overexpressing Th2 cytokines. In Lipopolysaccharide nephropathy , an immunological condition of renal toxicity linked to B7-1 ( CD80) , mice develop transient proteinuria<symptom> that lasts a few days. Overall , animal models are useful and necessary considering that they reproduce the evolution from MCD to FSGS that is , in part , due to persistence of proteinuria<symptom>. The role of T/Treg/Bcells on human MCD has been discussed. Many cytokines , immunomodulatory mechanisms , and several molecules have been defined as a specific cause of proteinuria<symptom>. However , the hypothesis of a single cell subset or molecule as cause of MCD is not supported by research and an interactive process seems more logical. The implication or interactive role of oxidants , Th2 cytokines , Th17 , Tregs , B7-1 ( CD80) , CD40/CD40L , c-Mip , TNF , uPA/suPAR , Angiopoietin-like 4 still awaits a definitive confirmation. Whole genome sequencing studies could help to define specific genetic features that justify a definition of MCD as a `` clinical-pathology-genetic entity. ''
