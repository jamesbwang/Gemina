 The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and effectiveness of stenting using partially covered self-expandable stents in palliation of dysphagia<symptom> in patients with unresectable esophageal cancer. Retrospective analysis of hospital records of all patients who underwent esophageal stenting in the period 2008-2015 was performed. The study included patients with unresectable esophageal and esophagogastric cancer. There were 442 patients included. Mean age was 56 years ( range 28-89) , and 379 were males. In 40 ( 9.0 %) patients , stenting was performed in the cervical , in 150 ( 39.3 %)- in the middle thoracic , in 141 ( 31.9 %)- in lower thoracic esophagus and in 111 ( 25.1 %)- in the esophagogastric junction. Stenting resulted in significant alleviation of dysphagia<symptom> grade ( 3.0 vs. 1.0 , p = 0.00001). During the follow-up , 55 ( 12.4 %) patients experienced recurrent dysphagia<symptom> due to tumor or granulation tissue overgrowth , and in 18 ( 4.1 %) patients , migration of the stent occurred , for which an independent risk factor was adjuvant chemo- and/or radiation therapy ( p = 0.001). Minor complications included chest<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 54.5 %) , delayed complete stent expansion ( 12.0 %) , feeling of a foreign body ( 25.3 %) , hiccup ( 1.6 %) , gastroesophageal reflux ( 45.6 %) and post-discharge pneumonia<disease> ( 2.5 %). A feeling of a foreign body in the esophagus was significantly more common after stenting of the cervical esophagus ( p = 0.0001) , and hiccup was more common after stenting of the esophagogastric junction ( p = 0.02). Major complications included bleeding ( 1.3 %) , respiratory insufficiency ( 0.7 %) , esophageal perforation ( 0.9 %) and irregular heartburn ( 2.3 %). Overall procedure-related mortality was 0.4 %. The median survival time was 117.8 days ( range 2-732). Stenting is an effective procedure in relieving dysphagia<symptom> in patients with unresectable malignant esophageal stenosis and is associated with low rate of postoperative and long-term complications.
