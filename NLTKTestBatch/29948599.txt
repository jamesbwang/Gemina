 Allergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms<symptom> are detrimental to health-related quality of life ( HRQoL). Health technology appraisal agencies often require cost-utility analysis when assessing new interventions. Appropriate utility estimates , which quantify the value of different conditions in cost-utility analyses , are scarce for allergic rhinitis and asthma health states. This study aimed to generate utilities for allergic rhinitis and asthma health states from a European general population sample of adults and children. Health state descriptions incorporating symptoms<symptom> , impact of symptoms<symptom> on daily life and symptom<symptom> treatment were developed using clinical guidelines. Descriptions were amended with clinician and patient input , and incorporated into a survey in which each health state was followed by a standard gamble ( adults) or visual analogue scale ( children) item. The survey was distributed to samples of adults and children aged 8 to 11 from four European countries that were stratified to represent the general population within that country. 1454 adults and 1082 children completed the survey. Mean health utilities ranged from 0.635 to 0.880 and those elicited in children were lower ( 0.635 to 0.705) than those elicited in adults ( 0.812 to 0.880). Disutilities assessing the impact of increased allergic rhinitis severity and comorbidities were also greater in children than in adults. Symptoms<symptom> of allergic rhinitis and asthma were valued as having a clinically meaningful impact on HRQoL. Children valued health states as poorer than adults , and further research should investigate whether this reflects true preferential differences or results from methodological and/or comprehension differences between the two groups.
