 To analyze the organ donation action in population-based neurointensive care of acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( aSAH) and to seek factors that would improve the identification of potential organ donors ( PODs) and increase the donor conversion rate ( DCR) after aSAH. The Kuopio Intracranial Aneurysm<disease> Database , prospective since 1995 , includes all aSAH patients admitted to the Kuopio University Hospital ( KUH) from its defined Eastern Finnish catchment population. We analyzed 769 consecutive acute aSAH patients from 2005 to 2015 , including their data from the Finnish Transplantation Unit and the national clinical registries. We analyzed PODs vs. actual donors among the 145 ( 19 %) aSAH patients who died within 14 days of admission. Finland had implemented the national presumed consent ( opt-out) within the study period in the end of 2010. We retrospectively identified 83 ( 57 %) PODs while only 49 ( 34 %) had become actual donors ( total DCR 59 %); the causes for non-donorship were 15/34 ( 44 %) refusals of consent , 18/34 ( 53 %) medical contraindications for donation , and 1/34 ( 3 %) failure of recognition. In 2005-2010 , there were 11 refusals by near relatives with DCR 52 % ( 29/56) and only three in 2011-2015 with DCR 74 % ( 20/27). Severe condition on admission ( Hunt and Hess grade IV or V) independently associated with the eventual POD status<symptom>. Nearly 20 % of all aSAH patients acutely admitted to neurointensive care from a defined catchment population died within 14 days , almost half from cardiopulmonary causes at a median age of 69 years. Of all aSAH patients , 11 % were considered as potential organ donors ( PODs). Donor conversion rate ( DCR) was increased from 52 to 74 % after the national presumed consent ( opt-out). Implicitly , DCR among aSAH patients could be increased by admitting them to the intensive care regardless of dismal prognosis for the survival , along a dedicated organ donation program for the catchment population.
