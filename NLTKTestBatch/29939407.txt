 Menopause , a risk factor for brain<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> in women , is characterized by neuropsychological symptoms<symptom> including depression<symptom> and dementia , which are closely related to alterations in different brain regions after menopause. However , little is known about the variability of pathophysiologic changes associated with menopause in the brain. Here , we observed that menopause in rats induced by bilateral ovariectomy ( OVX) showed depressive and dementia-related behaviors along with neuronal loss in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC) , hippocampus ( HIP) , hypothalamus ( HYP) and amygdala ( AMY) by Nissl staining. Meanwhile , by immunohistochemical staining , increased microglia in the HIP and AMY and increased astrocytes in the PFC , HYP and AMY were shown. By using quantitative proteomics , we identified 146 differentially expressed proteins in the brains of OVX rats , e.g. , 20 in the PFC , 41 in the HIP , 17 in the HYP and 79 in the AMY , and performed further detection by Western blotting. A link between neuronal loss and apoptosis was suggested , as evidenced by increases in adenylate kinase 2 ( AK2) , B-cell lymphoma 2 associated X ( Bax) , cleaved caspase-3 and phosphorylated p53 and decreases in Huntingtin-interacting protein K ( HYPK) , hexokinase ( HK) , and phosphorylated B-cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2) , and apoptosis might be triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress ( probed by increased glucose-regulated protein 78 ( GRP78) , cleaved caspase-12 , phosphorylated protein kinase R ( PKR)- like endoplasmic reticulum kinase ( PERK) , inositol-requiring enzyme-1 ( IRE-1) and activating transcription factor 6 ( ATF6)) and mitochondrial dysfunction ( probed by increased cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3 and decreased sideroflexin-1 ( SFXN1) and NADH dehydrogenase ( ubiquinone) 1 α subcomplex 11 ( NDUFA11)). Activation of autophagy was also indicated by increased autophagy-related 7 ( ATG7) , γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) receptor-associated protein-like 2 ( GABARAPL2) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1 ( ORP1) and confirmed by increased microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 ( LC3II/I) , autophagy-related 5 ( ATG5) , and Beclin1 in the HIP and AMY. In the AMY , which is important in emotion , higher GABA transporter 3 ( GAT3) and lower vesicular glutamate transporter 1 ( VgluT1) levels indicated an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission , and the increased calretinin and decreased calbindin levels suggested an adjustment of GABAergic transmission after OVX. In addition , cytoskeletal abnormalities including tau hyperphosphorylation , dysregulated Ca ²
