 Intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> stemming from a benign intracranial lesion<symptom> is much less commonly seen than from malignant tumors such as gliomas or metastases. Cerebellopontine angle ( CPA) lesions<symptom> rarely present with hemorrhage<symptom>. We describe the case of a 49-year-old male with a recurrent right<symptom> CPA meningioma arising from the petrous bone that was previously treated with a subtotal resection and postsurgical radiosurgery , presenting with acute left-sided hemiparesis<symptom> secondary to intratumoral hemorrhage<symptom>. Although surgical evacuation and decompression was recommended , the patient declined operative intervention and was managed medically. Meningiomas can cause subarachnoid , intraparenchymal , and rarely intratumoral hemorrhage<symptom>. Symptomatic hemorrhage<symptom> can worsen the prognosis , with increased morbidity and mortality. Several etiologies have been proposed for this phenomenon , including rupture of aberrant vasculature , intratumoral necrosis<symptom> , and tearing of stretched bringing veins. Only two prior cases of CPA meningioma have been reported in the literature. Recognition of CPA meningioma hemorrhage<symptom> as a clinical entity can help in future diagnoses and management.
