 We report the case of a 30-year old man with no previous medical history and without cardiovascular risk factors , hospitalized for NYHA Class IV dyspnoea associated with palpitations in the Department of Cardiology. Clinical examination showed signs of cardiac decompensation. The patient did n't have fever<symptom> , hepatosplenomegaly<symptom> and palpable lymphadenopathies. Laboratory tests showed hypereosinophilia greater than 4000 eosinophils per cubic millimeter. Electrocardiogram objectified atrial tachycardia<symptom> at a rate of 100 beats per minute. Echocardiographic examination showed good left ventricular function , dilation of both atria and a thrombus filling the right ventricular apex. The diagnosis of thrombus lining the ventricular apex was suspected ( A , B); successive exams showed progressive filling of the right ventricular apex. Cardiac MRI showed apical filling of both ventricles and after intravenous injection of gadolinium , late subendocardial enhancement in the left ventricular apex and in the right ventricular apex , suggesting fibrosis<disease> ( C , D). Etiologic investigation of hypereosinophilia excluded parasitic<disease> diseases<disease> , drug therapies , neoplasias and autoimmune diseases<disease> as a cause. The diagnosis of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome<symptom> associated with cardiac involvement was retained. Corticosteroid therapy associated with hydroxyurea therapy and long-term anticoagulant therapy were started. Patient 's evolution was gradually favorable with disappearance of hypereosinophilia.
