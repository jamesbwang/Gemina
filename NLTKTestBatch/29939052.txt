 Alliance , Mastery/Self-Efficacy , Problem Actualization , and Problem Clarification exemplify common or nonspecific factors of change in psychotherapy ( Grawe , 1997). In this study , we tested the hypothesis that other change factors mediate the alliance-outcome link on a within-person level over the treatment course. Our sample consisted of 193 patients with major depression<symptom> undergoing intensive inpatient cognitive-behavioral-based therapy. Each week , we assessed depressive symptoms<symptom> ( using the Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory-II) and change factors during individual therapy. Multilevel mediation models were used to test our hypothesis. As expected , within-person change in Alliance ( differentiated into Emotional Bond and Contentment with the Therapist) as well as Mastery/Self-Efficacy and Problem Clarification predicted symptom<symptom> change<symptom> over the course of therapy. Moreover , the relation between Contentment with the Therapist and subsequent change in depression<symptom> was mediated by increased Mastery/Self-Efficacy on a within-person level. Our data suggest that within-person change of alliance and other general change factors precede symptom<symptom> change<symptom> in depressive patients , and that the link between alliance and outcome may be partially mediated by enhanced Mastery/Self-Efficacy. Future studies should further elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the alliance-outcome link. ( PsycINFO Database Record
