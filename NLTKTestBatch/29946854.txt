 Neurotoxicity from high-dose cytarabine , a pyrimidine metabolite used in treatment for acute myeloid leukemia<disease> , is a known but dose-limiting toxicity which has incidences in up to 14 % in patients receiving high doses of the drug. Neurologic symptoms<symptom> vary but range from somnolence and ataxia<symptom> to more severe complications such as seizures<symptom> and even death. There are no validated treatments other than discontinuation of the drug and supportive measures. We present two cases of cytarabine-related neurotoxicity treated with corticosteroids with complete resolution of symptoms<symptom>.
