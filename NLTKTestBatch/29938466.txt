 Introduction: Colon Cancer remains one of the major worldwide causes of cancer related morbidity and mortality in both genders. Berberine ( BBR) , a major component of alkaloids that possess a variety of pharmacological properties. Objective: This study shows the ameliorating roles of berberine on 1,2 Di methyl hydrazine ( DMH) induced colon cancer in male Swiss albino rats. Methods: The rats were segregated into four groups: group 1 , control rats; group 2 , rats were orally received berberine ( 75 mg/kg b.wt./ day) daily for ten weeks; group 3 , rats were subcutaneously injected with DMH ( 20 mg/kg b.wt) once a week for 8 weeks , group 4 , rats were treated firstly with berberine for two weeks before DMH intoxication and concurrently with DMH over 8 weeks. Result: DMH injection decreased the antioxidants levels ( GSH and SOD) and increased inflammatory markers ( MPO , MAPK and COX-2). Moreover , it downregulated apoptotic markers ( Caspase-3 and P53) expression that confirmed by colon cell proliferation. The prophylactic effect of berberine was noticed as its pre-and co-administration increased antioxidants status<symptom> and apoptotic markers expression that associated with inflammatory markers down-regulation with absence of proliferated colon cells. Conclusion: Therefore , the overall findings proved that the anti-proliferative effect of berberine return to its antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties that activated the programmed cell death process.
