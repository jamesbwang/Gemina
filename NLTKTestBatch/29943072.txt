 To report a series of cases and microsurgical management of rarely occurring uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema ( UGH) syndrome<symptom> in patients with single-piece acrylic intraocular lens ( IOL) placed in the capsular bag. It was a series of patients with UGH syndrome<symptom> induced by posterior chamber IOL/capsular bag complex instability ( pseudophakodonesis) , who underwent IOL fixation to the iris. Visual acuity , intraocular pressure , number of glaucoma medications and IOL status ( position) were recorded by the same protocol before and 6 months after the surgical treatment. The case series presents three patients with UGH syndrome<symptom> caused by single-piece acrylic IOL placed in-the-bag. Each patient had uneventful phacoemulsification with posterior chamber IOL implantation few years ago and pseudophakodonesis caused by weakened zonules from pseudoexfoliation with subsequent development of UGH syndrome<symptom>. IOL fixation to the iris with satisfactory postoperative results was performed due to the development of UGH. Signs of syndrome<symptom> did not recur 6 months after the operation. UGH syndrome<symptom> can be induced by unstable in-the-bag IOL due to zonular laxity. Depending on the severity of the syndrome<symptom> , this condition can be fought by applying a minimally invasive approach-IOL suturing to the iris with direct observation under the surgical microscope precisely in the anticipated location with no or minimal pupil deformation. Symptoms<symptom> of UGH did not recur due to increased stability of the IOL and , as a result of this , declined irritation of the uveal tissue.
