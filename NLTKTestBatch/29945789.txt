 Nitrobenzene , a potentially harmful compound found in tobacco smoke , has been largely excluded from prior analysis due to difficulties with quantification. Quantifying harmful compounds in cigarette smoke is useful to compare products , to examine the impact of design parameters on delivery , and to help estimate exposures. A sensitive high-throughput method has been developed for quantifying nitrobenzene in machine-generated mainstream cigarette smoke using isotope dilution gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( ID-GC-MS/MS). This method has sufficient sensitivity to measure vapor phase nitrobenzene concentrations in the low nanogram range , with a 418 pg/cig method limit of detection. Precision estimates from two quality control cigarette products resulted in percent relative standard deviations of 11.5 % and 14.9 %; product variability estimates from 13 cigarette products resulted in percent relative standard deviations ranging from 2.8 % to 16.9 %. Nitrobenzene in the machine-generated , mainstream smoke from 15 cigarette products are reported and range from 18 to 38 ng/cig under the Health Canada Intense<symptom> smoking regimen.
