 Thermostable enzymes are a promising alternative for chemical catalysts currently used for the production of N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc) from chitin. In this study , a novel thermostable β-N-acetylglucosaminidase MthNAG was cloned and purified from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila C1. MthNAG is a protein with a molecular weight<symptom> of 71 kDa as determined with MALDI-TOF-MS. MthNAG has the highest activity at 50 °C and pH 4.5. The enzyme shows high thermostability above the optimum temperature: at 55 °C ( 144 h , 75 % activity) , 60 °C ( 48 h , 85 % activity; half-life 82 h) , and 70 °C ( 24 h , 33 % activity; half-life 18 h). MthNAG releases GlcNAc from chitin oligosaccharides ( GlcNAc)
