 Anxious youth often have trouble regulating negative affect ( NA) and tend to over-rely on parents when faced with challenges. It is unclear how social interactions with parents or peers actually helps or hinders anxious youths ' success in regulating NA. The aim of this study was to examine whether the success of anxious youths ' emotion regulation strategies differed according to social context. We compared the effectiveness of co-ruminating , co-problem solving and co-distracting with parents/peers for regulating anxious youth 's NA in response to stress in their daily lives. We also examined the benefit of attempting each strategy socially vs. non-socially ( e.g. , co-ruminating vs. ruminating). One-hundred-seventeen youth ( 9-14) with a current diagnosis of Separation Anxiety<symptom> Disorder , Generalized Anxiety<symptom> Disorder , and/or Social Phobia completed an ecological momentary assessment ( 14 calls over 5 days) , reporting on recent stressors , their affective state , presence of others , and emotion regulation strategies within the prior hour. Mixed linear models revealed that co-distracting was the most effective social strategy for reducing NA , but only for boys. Co-rumination was the least effective social strategy for regulating NA. Regarding social context , only co-distracting was more effective for regulating NA over distracting alone , but only among anxious boys. Results suggest that co-rumination is an ineffective use of social support for regulating NA. Anxious boys may benefit from social support by co-distracting with parents/peers , but improper use may reflect avoidance and contribute to long-term anxiety<symptom> maintenance. Results extend research on gender differences in interpersonal relationships and emotion regulation.
