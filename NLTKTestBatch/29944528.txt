 Single-stage cleft lip and<symptom> palate<symptom> repair is a debated surgical approach. While some studies have described favorable outcomes , concerns include the effect on craniomaxillofacial growth and increased risk of complications. To this date , there has not been a comprehensive appraisal of available data following combined cleft lip and<symptom> palate<symptom> repair. An extensive literature review was performed to identify all relevant articles. The level of evidence of these articles was graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence Scale. A total of 22 relevant articles were identified , all of which were retrospective in nature. Patient age at the time of surgery ranged from 1 month to 10 years , the longest duration of follow-up was 18 years , and the largest study included 106 patients. Review of the literature shows that overall surgical outcomes following combined cleft lip and<symptom> palate<symptom> repair are encouraging. An increased rate of postoperative fistulas<disease> with associated speech abnormalities in some studies is noteworthy. Importantly , there is no evidence to suggest an impact on craniomaxillofacial growth , and psychosocial outcomes and parental satisfaction seem to be improved with single-stage surgery as compared with the staged approach. Our review shows overall favorable outcomes associated with combined cleft lip and<symptom> palate<symptom> repair. The limited follow-up time or nature of evaluated outcomes in some studies may underrepresent the true rate of adverse events , and highlights the need for additional long-term studies with standardized follow-up. To our knowledge , our review is the first to evaluate existing data regarding outcomes following combined cleft lip and<symptom> palate<symptom> repair.
