 It has been suggested that accumulation of flavonoids could be a key step in development of plant tolerance to different environmental stresses. Moreover , it has been recognized that abiotic stresses such as drought and UV-B radiation ( 280-315 nm) induce phenolic compound accumulation , suggesting a role for these compounds in drought tolerance. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of UV-B exposure on chili pepper ( Capsicum annuum , cv. ` Coronel ') plant performance , phenolic compound production , and gene expression associated with response to subsequent drought stress. Additionally , the phenotypic response to drought stress of these plants was studied. UV-B induced a reduction both in stem length , stem dry<symptom> weight<symptom> and number of floral primordia. The largest reduction in these variables was observed when combining UV-B and drought. UV-B-treated well-watered plants displayed fructification approximately 1 week earlier than non-UV-B-treated controls. Flavonoids measured epidermally in leaves significantly increased during UV-B treatment. Specifically , UV-B radiation significantly increased chlorogenic acid and apigenin 8-C-hexoside levels in leaves and a synergistic increase of luteolin 6-C-pentoside-8-C-hexoside was obtained by UV-B and subsequent drought stress. Gene expression of phenylalanine ammonia<pathogen> lyase ( PAL) and chalcone synthase ( CHS) genes also increased during UV-B treatments. On the other hand , expression of genes related to an oxidative response , such as mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase ( Mn-SOD) and peroxidase ( POD) was not induced by UV-B. Drought stress in UV-B-treated plants induced mitochondrial Mn-SOD gene expression. Taken together , the UV-B treatment did not induce significant tolerance in plants towards drought stress under the conditions used.
