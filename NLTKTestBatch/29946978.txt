 A growing number of siderophores are found to contain β-hydroxyaspartic acid ( β-OH-Asp) as a functional group for Fe ( III) coordination<symptom> , along with the more common catechol and hydroxamic acid groups. This review covers the structures , biosynthesis , and reactions of peptidic β-OH-Asp siderophores. Hydroxylation of Asp in siderophore biosynthesis is predicted to be carried out either through discrete aspartyl β-hydroxylating enzymes or through hydroxylating domains within non-ribosomal peptide synthetases , both of which display sequence homology to known non-heme iron ( II) , α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Ferric complexes of β-OH-Asp siderophores are photoreactive , resulting in reduction of Fe ( III) and oxidative cleavage of the siderophore to yield distinct types of photoproducts. Probing the photoreactivity of synthetic Fe ( III)- α-hydroxycarboxylate clusters yields mechanistic insights into the different photoproducts observed for β-OH-Asp and other α-hydroxycarboxylate siderophore Fe ( III) complexes.
