 The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC) and its precursor lesion<symptom> Barrett 's esophagus ( BE) has been increasing steadily in the western world in recent decades. Understanding the cellular origins of BE and the conditions responsible for their malignant transformation would greatly facilitate risk assessment and identification of patients at risk of progression , but this topic remains a source of debate. Here , we review recent findings that have provided support for the gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ) as the main source of stem cells that give rise to BE and EAC. These include both gastric cardia cells and transitional basal cells. Furthermore , we discuss the role of chronic injury and inflammation in a tumor microenvironment as a major factor in promoting stem cell expansion and proliferation as well as transformation of the GEJ-derived stem cells and progression to EAC. We conclude that there exists a large amount of empirical support for the GEJ as the likely source of BE stem cells. While BE seems to resemble a successful adaptation to esophageal damage , carcinogenesis appears as a consequence of natural selection at the level of GEJ stem cells , and later glands , that expand into the esophagus wherein the local ecology creates the selective landscape for cancer progression.
