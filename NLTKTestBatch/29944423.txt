He was in a stimulatory situation and unable to give any information about his state of health. Patient was afebrile , tachycardic and laboratory results were normal. The chest and abdomen x-ray showed the Chilaiditi 's sign. With the ultrasound procedure the case of the pneumoperitoneum was excluded.
