 Hemophagocytic syndrome<symptom> ( HPS) is a clinicopathological entity characterized by histiocytic proliferation , with marked hemophagocytosis in the reticuloendothelial organs. HPS caused by lymphoma is termed lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syndrome<symptom> ( LAHS) , and there are few reports on canine and feline LAHS. The objective of this study was to examine the clinical , diagnostic , and clinicopathologic features of LAHS in six dogs. The diagnostic criteria of LAHS consisted of lymphoma , bicytopenia or pancytopenia in the blood , and increased hemophagocytosis in the reticuloendothelial organs. In one dog , an ocular form of lymphoma was recognized. A splenic form was recognized in two dogs , and a hepatosplenic form was recognized in three dogs. Immunophenotyping revealed T-cell origin in five dogs and B-cell origin in one dog by polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement analysis. Nonspecific esterase stain was performed to differentiate between neoplastic lymphocytes and hemophagocytes. All five dogs with T-cell lymphoma were diagnosed with large granular lymphocyte<symptom> ( LGL) lymphoma. In three cases , palliative therapy with glucocorticoids was conducted , while the other three cases received chemotherapy as well. The survival times for the three dogs with glucocorticoids only were 6 , 6 , and 10 days and were 30 , 54 , and 68 days for the three treated with anticancer therapy. The median survival time for the dogs was 20 days. This report indicates that canine LAHS is likely to be caused by LGL lymphoma , and it has an aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> and poor general prognosis , as seen in humans.
