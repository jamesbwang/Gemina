 In the treatment of metastatic breast cancer ( mBC) , regular monitoring is key in helping physicians to make informed clinical decisions , managing treatment side effects , and maintaining patients ' quality of life. Therefore , we investigated the monitoring frequency in post-menopausal women with HR +/ HER2- mBC stratified by first-line regimen. Treatment monitoring was assessed using two complementary data sources: a medical chart review ( chart review analysis) and a commercial claims database ( claims analysis). Women with post-menopausal HR +/ HER2- mBC who initiated first-line therapy for mBC were selected and classified under three cohorts , based on treatment received: cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 ( CDK4/6) inhibitor ( i.e. , palbociclib-the only CDK4/6 approved at the time of the study) , endocrine therapy ( ET) , and chemotherapy. Frequency of monitoring ( complete blood count ( CBC) , electrocardiogram ( EKG) , and liver function test ( LFT)) and laboratory abnormalities detected during the first line of therapy were analyzed. In the chart review analysis , 64 US oncologists abstracted medical information on 401 eligible patients , including 210 CDK4/6 users , 121 ET users , 51 chemotherapy users; 19 patients used other regimens. All patients had ≥ 1 CBC; between 8.3 % ( ET users) and 39.5 % ( CDK4/6 users) had ≥ 1 EKG; and over 98 % of patients had ≥ 1 LFT across all three cohorts. Among monitored patients , 64.6 % had a CBC abnormality , with anemia<symptom> ( 39.9 %) , leukopenia<symptom> ( 27.4 %) , and neutropenia ( 26.7 %) being the most common. Abnormal EKG readings were detected in 8.4 , 0.0 % , and 7.7 % of CDK4/6 , ET , and chemotherapy users , respectively. LFT abnormalities were detected in 14.1-26.0 % of CDK4/6 and chemotherapy users , respectively. Similar frequency of monitoring was observed in the claims analysis , with the exception of EKG monitoring , for which the proportion of patients tested was higher. Post-menopausal women with HR +/ HER2- mBC receiving first-line therapy with CDK4/6 , ET , or chemotherapy were regularly monitored regardless of the first-line regimen received.
