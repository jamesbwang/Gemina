 Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT) is in clinical use today to treat metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Infused radiolabeled somatostatin analogue peptides targets the tumors which are killed by irradiation damage. The peptides , however , are also retained in the kidneys due to glomerular filtration , and the administered doses must be limited to avoid kidney damage. The human radical scavenger and antioxidant Î±1-microglobulin ( A1M) has previously been shown to protect bystander tissue against irradiation damage , and has pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties similar to somatostatin analogues. Here , we have investigated if A1M can be used as a renal protective agent in PRRT. We describe nephroprotective effects of human recombinant A1M on the short- and long-term renal damage observed following 177Lu-DOTATATE ( 150 MBq) exposure in BALB/c mice. After 1 , 4 and 8 days ( short term) , 177Lu-DOTATATE-injection resulted in increased formation of DNA double-strand breaks in the renal cortex , up-regulated expression of apoptosis and stress-response related genes , and proteinuria<symptom> ( albumin in urine) , all of which were significantly suppressed by co-administration of A1M ( 7 mg/kg). After 6 , 12 and 24 weeks ( long term) , 177Lu-DOTATATE-injection resulted in increased animal death , kidney lesions<symptom> , glomerular loss , up-regulation of stress-genes , proteinuria<symptom> , and plasma markers of reduced kidney function , all of which were suppressed by co-administration of A1M. Innovation and conclusion: This study demonstrates that A1M effectively inhibits radiation-induced renal damage. The findings suggest that A1M may be used as a radioprotector during clinical PRRT , potentially facilitating improved tumor control and enabling more patients to receive treatment.
