 While detailed analysis of aberrant cancer cell signaling pathways and changes<symptom> in cancer cell DNA has dominated the field of breast cancer biology for years , there now exists increasing evidence that the tumor microenvironment ( TME) including tumor-infiltrating immune cells support the growth and development of breast cancer and further facilitate invasion and metastasis formation as well as sensitivity to drug therapy. Furthermore , breast cancer cells have developed different strategies to escape surveillance from the adaptive and innate immune system. These include loss of expression of immunostimulatory molecules , gain of expression of immunoinhibitory molecules such as PD-L1 and HLA-G , and altered expression of components involved in apoptosis. Furthermore , the composition of the TME plays a key role in breast cancer development and treatment response. In this review we will focus on i) the different immune evasion mechanisms used by breast cancer cells , ii) the role of immune cell infiltration in this disease<disease> , and ( iii) implication for breast cancer-based immunotherapies.
