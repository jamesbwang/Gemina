 The early use of tranexamic acid ( TXA) is strongly advocated in patients who are likely to require massive transfusion to decrease mortality. This study determines the influence of hemorrhage<symptom> on the pharmacokinetics of TXA in a porcine model. The investigation was a prospective experimental study in Yucatan minipigs. First , in vitro plasma-cell partitioning of TXA was evaluated by inoculating whole blood with known aliquots , centrifuging , and measuring the supernatant with high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry ( HPLC-MS). Then , using in vivo modeling , normovolemic and hypovolemic ( 35 % reduction in blood volume) swine ( n = 4 per group) received 1 g of intravenous TXA and had blood sampled at 14 time points over 4 hours to determine baseline clearance via HPLC-MS. Additional swine ( n = 4) were hemorrhaged 35 % of their blood volume , and TXA was administered as a 15 mg/kg infusion over 10 minutes followed by infusion of 1.875 mg/kg per hour to simulate massive hemorrhage<symptom> scenario. During the first hour of TXA administration , one total blood volume was hemorrhaged and simultaneously replaced with TXA free blood. Serial blood samples and the hemorrhaged blood were analyzed by HPLC-MS to determine the percentage of dose lost via hemorrhage<symptom>. Clearance of TXA was diminished in the hypovolemic group compared with the normovolemic group ( 115 ± 4 vs 70 ± 7 mL/min). Percentage of dose lost via hemorrhage<symptom> averaged 25 %. The lowest measured plasma level during the exchange transfusion was 34 μg/mL. Mean 25 % of the present 2017 Joint Trauma System Clinical Practice Guideline dosing of TXA can be lost to hemorrhage<symptom> if a blood volume is transfused within an hour of initiating therapy. In the case of TXA , which has limited distribution and is administered during active hemorrhage<symptom> and massive blood transfusions , replacement strategies should be developed and tested to find simple methods of adjusting the current dosing guidelines to maintain therapeutic plasma concentrations.
