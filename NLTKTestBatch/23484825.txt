 To understand the variety of conditions in which the pericardium may be affected in cancer patients. Cancer may affect the pericardium directly ( primary cancer; uncommon) or through metastases ( commoner). Cancer treatment ( chemotherapy and radiotherapy) may affect the pericardium leading to pericarditis<disease> and myopericarditis. Pericardial<symptom> effusions<symptom> , tamponade and constrictive pericarditis<disease> are complications that can also occur. A variety of techniques ( predominantly cardiac imaging related) are used to make the diagnosis with the treatment strategy dependent on whether the pericardial disease<disease> is due to cancer or as a result of cancer treatment. A variety of pericardial diseases<disease> may be caused by cancer and cancer treatment. Determining the aetiology and providing effective treatment can often be challenging.
