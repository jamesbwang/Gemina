 A sudden increase in the number of newborn infants with microcephaly in Brazil in 2015 brought Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV<pathogen>) , a less-known infection<disease> , to public attention. The rapid increase in the number of cases across the Americas and the devastating complications of infection<disease> with ZIKV<pathogen> highlighted the gravity of the situation. Within a relatively short period of time , our knowledge of this infection<disease> has significantly increased. This includes the realisation that ZIKV<pathogen> can be sexually transmitted. The aim of the present article is to provide a concise summary on this novel sexually transmitted infection<disease> linked to human birth defects and Guillain-Barre Syndrome<symptom>. According to World Health Organization , individuals living outside areas of ZIKV<pathogen> mosquito transmission where one or both partners have been exposed to ZIKV<pathogen> should abstain from sex or have sex with condoms for at least six months after the last day of possible exposure.
