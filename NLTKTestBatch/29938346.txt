 β Clinical prospectively collected data of all infants born between 2001 and 2012 and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU) at Heidelberg University Hospital and respective maternal data were merged. For the current retrospective cohort study , cases ( IH) were matched to controls ( no IH) at a ratio of 1:4 , adjusting for birth weight , gestational age , gender and multiple gestations. Prenatal exposure to fenoterol and perinatal outcome were analyzed in the total cohort and in subgroups. N = 5070 infants were admitted to our neonatal department , out of which n = 172 infants with IH were identified and compared to n = 596 matched controls. Exposure to fenoterol was not associated with a higher rate of IH in the total matched population ( OR 0.926 , 95 % CI 0.619-1.384) or in a subgroup of neonates < 32 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight < 1500 g ( OR 1.127 , 95 % CI 0.709-1.791). In the total matched population , prenatal exposure to glucocorticoids was associated with a reduced occurrence of IH ( OR 0.566 , 95 % CI 0.332-0.964) and neonates with IH showed a prolonged total hospital stay compared to controls ( 69 vs. 57 days , p = 0.0033). Known risk factors for IH were confirmed by our large study cohort and included female gender , low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight , preterm birth and multiple gestations ( all p < 0.005). Exposure to fenoterol during pregnancy does not increase the occurrence of IH. Further studies are needed to explore differences in the risk profiles of different β
