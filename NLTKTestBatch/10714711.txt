 To evaluate our institutional experience using brachytherapy for the re-irradiation of the head<disease> and neck. We reviewed the records of patients who received brachytherapy for head<disease> and neck cancer in a previously irradiated field between 2007 and 2016. Sixty-nine patients received brachytherapy-based re-irradiation. Forty-nine patients ( 71 %) were treated for recurrent cancers , 15 patients ( 22 %) had second primary cancers , and five patients ( 7 %) were treated for persistent tumors. The median dose was 90 Gy ( range 30-180). Median follow-up was 3.0 years for surviving patients and 0.6 years for all patients. Overall survival at one , three , and five years was 58 % , 19 % , and 12 % , respectively. Local control at one , three , and five years was 55 % , 38 % , and 28 % , respectively. A disease-free interval of less than one year was associated with significantly worse local control ( p = .04). Patients who received brachytherapy for a neck disease<disease> had significantly worse locoregional control than those who received brachytherapy for mucosal disease<disease> ( heart rate ( HR) 2.14 , 95 % CI 1.00-4.56 , p = .05). Patients who had an extranodal extension had significantly worse overall survival than those without an extranodal extension ( HR 2.57 , 95 % CI 1.28-5.37 , p = .008). Seventy-four percent of patients who had pain before brachytherapy ( with or without surgery) had an improvement of symptoms<symptom>. Acute and chronic toxicity of at least Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 was seen in 27 % and 19 % of the patients , respectively. Brachytherapy-based re-irradiation is an effective approach for patients undergoing re-irradiation for head<disease> and neck cancer. Brachytherapy may be more effective for mucosal recurrences than neck recurrences.
