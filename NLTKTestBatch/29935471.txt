 Depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> are significantly associated with systemic inflammation<symptom>. Moreover , oxidative stress resulting from a disturbance in the prooxidant-antioxidant balance<symptom> is linked to inflammation-related conditions. Therefore , depression/anxiety symptoms<symptom> may also be associated with oxidative stress. To examine the association between depression/anxiety symptoms<symptom> and serum prooxidant-antioxidant balance<symptom> ( PAB) in adults who participated in a large population-based , cross-sectional study. Serum PAB values were measured in 7516 participants ( 62 % females and 38 % males) aged 35-65 years , enrolled in a population-based cohort study. beck depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> inventories were used to evaluate symptoms<symptom> of depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom>. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the effect of confounders on the status of serum PAB change. Among men , serum PAB values were increased incrementally from 1.55 ± 0.47 to 1.59 ± 0.47 , 1.69 ± 0.38 , and 1.68 ± 0.38 in the no or minimal , mild , moderate and severe<symptom> depression<symptom> groups , respectively ( P Symptoms<symptom> of depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> appear to be associated with higher degrees of oxidative stress , expressed by higher serum PAB values.
