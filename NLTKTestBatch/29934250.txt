 Treatment resistant schizophrenia ( TRS) is defined by poor or non-response to conventional antipsychotic agents. Functional capacity is defined as the baseline potential of a patient to function in the community , irrespective of actual achievements gained , and has never been studied in TRS. Here , we screened 182 patients with psychotic symptoms<symptom> and separated them in TRS ( n = 28) and non-TRS ( n = 32) ones , to evaluate whether they exhibited differential extents and predictive clinical variables of functional capacity. Functional capacity was measured by the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment ( UPSA). Psychotic symptoms<symptom> by PANSS , social functioning by PSP and SLOF , clinical severity of the illness , cognitive functioning , and neurological soft signs ( NSS) were assessed. TRS patients had non-significant lower UPSA scores compared to non-TRS ( t-test: p > 0.05). In TRS , UPSA score correlated with multiple clinical variables. The highest effect sizes were observed for PANSS negative score ( r = -0.67 , p < 0.005); SLOF Area1 score ( r = 0.66 , p < 0.005); NSS severity ( r = -0.61 , p < 0.005). Multivariate analysis showed that main predictors of UPSA score in TRS patients were PANSS negative score , education years , NSS , Problem Solving performances , and PSP score ( F = 11.12 , R
