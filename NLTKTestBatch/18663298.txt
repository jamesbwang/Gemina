 Dental<disease> caries<disease> had been studied by several studies in Saudi Arabia among different age groups and at various places. According to World Health Organization ( WHO) , assessment of caries<disease> at 15 years of age is more meaningful. The objective of this survey was to assess the prevalence of dental<disease> caries<disease> among 15-17-year teenage students in Abha , Saudi Arabia. Results of the present study can be used as baseline data for future oral health interventions for the population. A stratified cluster random sampling was followed in selecting the students. The clinical data was collected using dentition status<symptom> component of WHO oral health assessment form 2013. Five investigators were trained and calibrated with 20 subjects for two successive days ( Cronbach 's Alpha = 0.91). Data was analyzed for descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney Prevalence of dental<disease> caries<disease> among the study population was found to be 72.9 %. The DMFT scores were found to be highest in the posteriors ( 90.7 %). First permanent molar was the most common tooth affected by dental<disease> caries<disease> in all quadrants. The present study revealed that there is a high prevalence of dental<disease> caries<disease> among students aged 15-17 years in Abha , Saudi Arabia.
