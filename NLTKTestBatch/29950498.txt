 A 30-year-old woman with severe dengue<pathogen> presented on the sixth day of her illness with life-threatening thrombocytopenia<symptom> , refractory to multiple platelet transfusions. Dengue IgM antibody and the non-structural-1 antigen tests as of day 3 were negative. The IgG antibody against the same was positive , suggesting a past episode of dengue<pathogen>. Since she had a history of menorrhagia<symptom> prior to the current illness , a working diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was made , for which intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg) was administered that led to a rapid rise in the platelet count with no adverse events. Subsequently , dengue IgM antibody repeated on day 6 came back positive , confirming dengue<pathogen>. This case report re-emphasises the potential use of IVIg in patients with severe<symptom> thrombocytopenia<symptom> in dengue<pathogen>.
