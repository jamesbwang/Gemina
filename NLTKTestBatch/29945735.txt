 Pulmonary impairment is a common complication after coronary artery bypass graft procedure and may be prevented or treated by noninvasive ventilation. Recruitment maneuvers include sustained airway pressure with high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with hypoxemia<symptom> , favoring homogeneous pulmonary ventilation and oxygenation. This study aimed to evaluate whether noninvasive ventilation with recruitment maneuver could safely improve oxygenation in patients with atelectasis and hypoxemia<symptom> who underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure. Thirty-four patients admitted to our intensive care unit undergoing mechanical ventilation after surgery , with ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen < 300 and radiologic atelectasis score ≥ 2 , were included. The control group consisted of 16 randomized patients and the recruitment group consisted of 18 patients. After extubation , noninvasive ventilation was applied for 30 minutes 3 times a day with positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cm H Arterial oxygen partial pressure increased 12.6 % ± 6.8 % in the control group and 23.3 % ± 8.5 % in the recruitment group ( P < .001). The radiologic atelectasis score was completely improved for 94.4 % of the recruitment group with no adverse events , whereas 87.5 % of the control group presented some atelectasis ( P < .001). Noninvasive ventilation with recruitment maneuvers is safe , improves oxygenation , and reduces atelectasis in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass.
