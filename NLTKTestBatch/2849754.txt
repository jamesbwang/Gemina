 The helicase gene of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus<pathogen> ( AcMNPV) is not only involved in viral DNA replication , but also plays a role in viral host range. To identify the codon usage bias of helicase of AcMNPV , the codon usage bias of helicase was especially studies in AcMNPV and 41 reference strains of baculoviruses<pathogen> by calculating the codon adaptation index ( CAI) , effective number of codon ( ENc) , relative synonymous codon usage ( RSCU) , and other indices. The helicase of baculovirus<pathogen> is less biased ( mean ENc = 50.539 > 40; mean CAI = 0.246). AcMNPV helicase has a strong bias toward the synonymous codons with G and C at the third codon position ( GC3s = 53.6 %). The plot of GC3s against ENc values revealed that GC compositional constraints are the main factor that determines the codon usage bias of major of helicase. Several indicators supported that the codon usage pattern of helicase is mainly subject to mutation pressure. Analysis of variation in codon usage and amino acid composition indicated AcMNPV helicase shows the significant preference for one or more postulated codons for each amino acid. A cluster analysis based on RSCU values suggested that AcMNPV is evolutionarily closer to members of group I alphabaculovirus<pathogen>. Comparison of the codon usage pattern among E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom> , yeast , mouse , human and AcMNPV showed that yeast is a suitable expression system for AcMNPV helicase. AcMNPV helicase shows weak codon usage bias. This study may help in elucidating the functional mechanism of AcMNPV helicase and the evolution of baculovirus<pathogen> helicases.
