 This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between upper instrumented vertebra ( UIV) level and cervical sagittal alignment ( CSA) in Lenke 1 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS) patients , treated with posterior instrumentation. The hypothesis was that higher level of UIV would cause decreased cervical lordosis. Sixty-three Lenke 1AIS patients that underwent posterior fusion with pedicle screw instrumentation were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided into three groups according to UIV level ( T2 , T3 , T4). Twenty patients without spinal deformity made up the control group. Patients were compared at two years follow-up according to radiographic changes in coronal and sagittal planes. Main sagittal parameters were C2-C7 cervical lordosis ( CL) , T1 slope , T1-T5 and T5-T12 kyphosis. Clinical outcomes were assessed using scoliosis research society ( SRS) -22 , short form ( SF) -36 and neck disability index ( NDI) questionnaires. Preoperative sagittal plane values of AIS patients were similar to the control group. C2-C7 CL , T1-T5 kyphosis and T1 slope significantly decreased postoperatively in T2 and T3 groups ( p < 0.05). These parameters were not changed significantly in T4 group after the surgery. T5-T12 kyphosis did not change significantly in all groups. SRS-22 and SF-36 scores significantly improved ( p < 0.05) , while NDI scores were not changed significantly after the surgery. In Lenke 1 AIS , treated with segmental all pedicle screw instrumentation using precontoured rods and rod rotation maneuver , postoperative decreased CL is more likely to occur if the UIV is selected as T2 or T3. Decreased CL seems to be caused by reduced T1-T5 kyphosis and T1 slope. However the decrease in CL did not effect clinical outcome scores , including NDI , adversely. Hence , extending the fusion to appropriate level for shoulder balance<symptom> seems reasonable. IV.
