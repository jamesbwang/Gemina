 Most nail salon workers in the greater New<pathogen> York City area are Asian immigrant women. They are exposed daily to potentially toxic chemicals and hazards in their workplace , making them more vulnerable for possible health problems. The study 's primary purpose was to identify factors influencing past year healthcare utilization among Asian immigrant women working in nail salons. A cross-sectional study was conducted based on a modification of Andersen 's behavioral model of healthcare utilization in which 148 Korean and Chinese immigrant women currently working in nail salons were surveyed. The questionnaire included: ( 1) individual health determinants , ( 2) health service utilization in the past year , and ( 3) work environment , work-related health concerns , and work-related health problems. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression models assessed factors related to past year healthcare utilization. Women who had health insurance ( p < .01) , a usual source of care ( p < .01) , low educational attainment ( p < .05) , and more work-related health symptoms<symptom> ( p < .05) were more likely to visit a primary care provider. Women who had health insurance ( p < .01) , a usual source of care ( p < .05) , and low educational attainment ( p < .05) , were also more likely to visit a woman 's health provider. Korean ( rather than Chinese) women ( p < .05) and women who perceived themselves to be in fair/poor health ( p < .05) were more likely to see a traditional provider of Eastern<disease> medicine. Asian immigrant women who work in nail salons have workplace health and safety concerns. They generally use Western rather than traditional medicine , with different factors related to these two types of medicine.
