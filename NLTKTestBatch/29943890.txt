 To describe differences in patient characteristics and outcomes by ethnicity in patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM) and<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF , ejection fraction â‰¤ 35 %) in a multi-ethnic cohort. Patient level data from two cohorts ( HF-ACTION and ASIAN-HF) were combined , and patients grouped by self-reported ethnicity. DM was defined as the presence of a clinical diagnosis and/or receiving anti-diabetic therapy. A total of 6214 ( 1324 whites , 674 blacks , 1297 Chinese , 1510 Indians , 717 Malays , 692 Japanese/Koreans) patients were included. The overall prevalence of DM was 39.5 % ( n = 2454). The prevalence of DM was lowest in whites ( 29.3 %) , followed by Japanese/Koreans ( 34.1 %) , blacks ( 35.9 %) , Chinese ( 42.3 %) , Indians ( 44.2 %) , and highest in Malays ( 51.9 %). The correlation between age , sex , body mass index , coronary artery disease<disease> , hypertension , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , peripheral vascular disease<disease> and chronic kidney disease<disease> with DM differed significantly by ethnicity ( P for interaction < 0.05). The strongest correlations were seen in Malay women , whites with obesity , Indians with coronary artery disease<disease> and hypertension , and blacks with chronic kidney disease<disease>. On multivariable analyses , DM was significantly associated with the composite of 1-year overall mortality/HF hospitalization ( hazard ratio 1.37 , 95 % confidence interval 1.19-1.57; P < 0.001) , with no interaction by ethnicity ( P for interaction = 0.31). There is marked heterogeneity in the prevalence and correlates of DM among different ethnic groups with HF worldwide. Subgroups particularly predisposed to DM warrant special attention , since DM increases the combined risk of morbidity and mortality in all ethnicities with HF.
