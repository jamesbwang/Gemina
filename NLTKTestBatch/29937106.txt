 Although subtraction coronary computed tomography angiography ( S-CCTA) has recently been developed to improve the diagnostic ability in patients with severe calcification , increase in radiation exposure remains a concern. The usefulness of S-CCTA using a low-radiation dose protocol was investigated. S-CCTA in 320-row area detector CT was performed on 84 consecutive patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease<disease> with Agatston score ≥ 100. Reconstruction and radiation dose were changed according to the slow filling time ( SF) ( 137.5 ms < SF ≤ 262.5 ms. Half reconstruction without reduction of the current , 262.5 ms < SF ≤ 275ms: automatic patient motion correction with 50 % reduction , SF ≥ 275ms: full reconstruction with 70 % reduction) at a tube voltage of 100kV. The percentage of patients with non-diagnostic stenosis of calcified coronary artery lesions<symptom> was calculated in conventional ( C-) CCTA , and S-CCTA was calculated based on 84 patients ( 446 segments) bases. In 27 patients ( 137 segments) examined by invasive coronary angiography ( ICA) , the diagnostic ability was investigated regarding the ICA findings as reference standard. The percentage of non-diagnostic patients and segments on C-CCTA vs. S-CCTA was 40.5 % vs. 9.5 % and 16.4 % vs. 2.9 % , respectively. The Agatston score was 589.3 ± 655.3 , and the total effective radiation dose ( non-contrast scan and C-CCTA) was 2.7 ± 1.1 mSv. In the 27 patients , 137 segments area under the curve of S-CCTA ( 0.939 , 95 % CI: 0.895-0.983) for the ICA findings as reference standard was significantly higher than that of C-CCTA ( 0.785 , 95 % CI: 0.713-0.858) ( p < 0.0001). The diagnostic ability of S-CCTA performed following the low-radiation dose protocol for patients with calcification was superior to that of C-CCTA alone.
