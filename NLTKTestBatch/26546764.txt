 Mangroves of the semiarid Caatinga region of northeastern Brazil are being rapidly converted to shrimp pond aquaculture. To determine ecosystem carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from this widespread land use , we measured carbon stocks of eight mangrove forests and three shrimp<disease> ponds in the Acaraú and Jaguaribe watersheds in Ceará state , Brazil. The shrimp<disease> ponds were paired with adjacent intact mangroves to ascertain carbon losses<symptom> and potential emissions from land conversion. The mean total ecosystem carbon stock of mangroves in this semiarid tropical landscape was 413 ± 94 Mg C/ha. There were highly significant differences in the ecosystem carbon stocks between the two sampled estuaries suggesting caution when extrapolating carbon stock across different estuaries even in the same landscape. Conversion of mangroves to shrimp<disease> ponds resulted in losses<symptom> of 58 % -82 % of the ecosystem carbon stocks. The mean potential emissions arising from mangrove conversion to shrimp<disease> ponds was 1,390 Mg CO
