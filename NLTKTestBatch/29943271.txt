 Slow breathing ( SLOWB) alleviates symptoms<symptom> of chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) but its long-term effects are unknown. We examined the acute and long-term impact of device-guided breathing on hemodynamics and prognostic parameters in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF). Twenty-one patients with HFrEF ( 23.9 ± 5.8 % , SD ± mean) on optimal medical therapy underwent blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) , heart rate ( HR) , HR variability , 6-min walk test ( 6MWT) , cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET) , and echocardiography measurements before and 3 months after SLOWB home training ( 30 min daily). After 3 months , all patients were assigned to continue SLOWB ( Group 1) or no-SLOWB ( Group 2). All tests were repeated after 6 months. Acute SLOWB ( 18 ± 5 vs 8 ± 2 breaths/min , P < 0.001) had no influence on BP and HR but improved saturation ( 97 ± 2 vs 98 ± 2 % , P = 0.01). Long-term SLOWB reduced office systolic BP ( P < 0.001) but not central or ambulatory systolic BP. SLOWB reduced SDNN/RMSSD ratio ( P < 0.05) after 3 months. One-way repeated measures of ANOVA revealed a significant increase in 6MWT and peak RER ( respiratory exchange ratio) from baseline to 6-month follow-up in group 1 ( P < 0.05) but not group 2 ( P = 0.85 for 6MWT , P = 0.69 for RER). No significant changes in echocardiography were noted at follow-up. No HF worsening , rehospitalisation or death occurred in group 1 out to 6-month follow-up. Two hospitalizations for HF decompensation and two deaths ensued in group 2 between 3- and 6-month follow-up. SLOWB training improves cardiorespiratory capacity and appears to slow the progression of HFrEF. Further long-term outcome studies are required to confirm the benefits of paced breathing in HFrEF.
