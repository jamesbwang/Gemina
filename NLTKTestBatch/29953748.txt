 Visual analog scale patient global assessments ( PGA-VAS) are widely used in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) practice and research. Low PGA-VAS scores are required for remission. Vulnerable patients may have difficulty completing the PGA-VAS. There is limited information about both patients ' perceptions of PGA-VAS and how patients score VAS model disease<disease> states. The objective of this study is to understand vulnerable patients ' perspectives regarding PGA-VAS and model disease<disease> states. We enrolled RA patients at Denver Health ( n = 300). Subjects completed the disease<disease> activity score-28 ( DAS28-PGA-VAS) and Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire ( MDHAQ-PGA-VAS) and completed a questionnaire regarding these PGA-VAS. Subjects also scored remission , mild , moderate and severe model disease<disease> states by VAS. We performed analyses using summary statistics , linear , and logistic regression. Outcomes included: whether subjects found the PGA-VAS confusing , if subjects ' responses to the model disease<disease> states followed a natural progression ( remission < mild < moderate < severe) , and whether responses to the remission model would meet Boolean and simplified disease<disease> activity index ( SDAI)- based remission criteria. Approximately 40 % of subjects found the PGA-VAS confusing; lower health literacy ( HL) and depressive symptoms<symptom> were associated with finding them confusing. Less than 25 % of subjects ranked the model disease<disease> states with natural progression and the remission model at the threshold for remission; higher HL and income were associated with accomplishing these objectives. Vulnerable patients perceive difficulty with PGA-VAS , and do not reliably rate model disease<disease> state VAS. These patients are potentially at risk for disease<disease> activity misclassification because of literacy and other barriers in completing VAS. This article is protected by copyright.
