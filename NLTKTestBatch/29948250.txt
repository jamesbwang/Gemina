 Apathy is a frequent and debilitating condition with few treatment options available in schizophrenia patients. Despite evidence of its multidimensional structure , most of past studies have explored apathy through a categorical approach. The main objective of this study was to identify the cognitive , emotional , motivational , and clinical factors at baseline that best predicted the three subtypes of apathy dimensions at follow-up. In a longitudinal study , 137 participants diagnosed with schizophrenia underwent different assessments including clinical , motivational , affective and cognitive measurements , at 1-month ( referred to as baseline) and 12-month follow-ups. Data were analyzed using partial least squares variance-based structural equation modeling. Three latent variables representing the three previously described domains of apathy reaching consensus in the literature were extracted from the Lille Apathy Rating Scale. Results showed that in addition to baseline apathy , positive symptoms<symptom> , anticipatory pleasure and sensibility to punishment at baseline predicted cognitive apathy at follow-up. Likewise , both baseline apathy and sensibility to punishment predicted emotional apathy at follow-up. Finally , baseline anhedonia and episodic memory were the main variables the predicted behavioral apathy at follow-up. This is the first study to show specific associations between apathy subtypes and clinical and cognitive motivational dysfunction in individual with schizophrenia , indicating possible distinct underlying mechanisms to these demotivational symptoms<symptom>. Treatment for apathy should address both types of processes. Importantly , our results demonstrate the interest of multidimensional approaches in the understanding of apathy in schizophrenia.
