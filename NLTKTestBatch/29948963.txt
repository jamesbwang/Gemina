 Within the initiatives for poliomyelitis<disease> eradication by WHO , Italy activated an environmental surveillance ( ES) in 2005. ES complements clinical Acute Flaccid<symptom> Paralysis<symptom> ( AFP) surveillance for possible polio<disease> cases , detects poliovirus<pathogen> circulation in environmental sewage , and is used to monitor transmission in communities. In addition to polioviruses<pathogen> , the analyses comprised: ( i) the monitoring of the presence of non-polio enteroviruses<pathogen> in sewage samples and ( ii) the temporal and geographical distribution of the detected viruses<pathogen>. From 2009 to 2015 , 2880 sewage samples were collected from eight cities participating in the surveillance. Overall , 1479 samples resulted positive for enteroviruses<pathogen>. No wild-type polioviruses<pathogen> were found , although four Sabin-like polioviruses<pathogen> were detected. The low degree of mutation found in the genomes of these four isolates suggests that these viruses<pathogen> have had a limited circulation in the population. All non-polio enteroviruses<pathogen> belonged to species B and the most frequent serotype was CV-B5 , followed by CV-B4 , E-11 , E-6 , E-7 , CV-B3 , and CV-B2. Variations in the frequency of different serotypes were also observed in different seasons and/or Italian areas. Environmental surveillance in Italy , as part of the ` WHO global polio<disease> eradication program ' , is a powerful tool to augment the polio<disease> surveillance and to investigate the silent circulation or the re-emergence of enteroviruses<pathogen> in the population.
