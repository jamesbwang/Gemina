 Very few studies have been conducted in India and other parts of the world on visual impairment among individuals aged 15-49 years. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence , causes , and associated factors of visual impairment among adults aged 15-49 years in a rural population of Jhajjar district , Haryana , north India. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in two blocks of Jhajjar district. A total of 34 villages were selected using probability proportionate to size sampling method. Adults aged 15-49 years were selected using compact segment cluster sampling approach. As part of the house-to-house survey , presenting visual acuity using screening chart corresponding to five `` E '' 6/12 optotypes was measured along with collection of other demographic details. The optometrists performed detailed eye assessment including repeat measurement of visual acuity using retro-illuminated conventional logMAR tumbling `` E '' charts , torch light examination , and non-cycloplegic refraction at a clinic site within the village to ascertain visual impairment and its cause. Of 5,470 enumerated adults , 5,117 ( 94 %) completed all study procedures. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of visual impairment was found to be 1.85 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.48 , 2.23) and blindness<symptom> was 0.09 % ( 95 % CI: 0.01 , 0.18). The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of unilateral visual impairment was 1.11 % ( 95 % CI: 0.81 , 1.41). Uncorrected refractive errors ( 84 %) contributed maximum to visual impairment in this age group. The visual impairment in study participants was found to be associated with age and educational status. At the community level , uncorrected refractive errors contribute largely to visual impairment in the age group of 15-49 years.
