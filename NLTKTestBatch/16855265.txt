 To assess whether beta-blocker use is associated with cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF) , this study analyzed the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> with an Aldosterone Antagonist ( TOPCAT) trial data using Cox proportional hazard models. Adjusted HRs for composite cardiovascular events in all patients and in patients without previous MI were significantly higher for those on beta-blockers than for those not on beta-blockers ( Hazard ratio ( HR) for all patients 1.23 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) 1.02-1.49; HR for patients without previous MI 1.35 , 95 % CI 1.08-1.70) , whereas that for patients with previous MI was not significantly different ( HR 1.06 , 95 % CI 0.74-1.54). Additionally , cardiovascular event risk in propensity score-matched patients without previous MI was significantly higher in those on beta-blockers than in those not on beta-blockers. Risks of all-cause death , major cardiovascular events , and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalization were significantly higher in those on beta-blockers than in those not on beta-blockers. Beta-blocker use in HFpEF patients , particularly those without previous MI , was associated with increased risk of unfavorable cardiovascular events.
