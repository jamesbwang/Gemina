 The safety of surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA) in very low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight<symptom> premature neonates has been questioned because of associated morbidities. However , these studies are vulnerable to significant bias as surgical ligation has historically been utilized as `` rescue '' therapy. The objective of this study was to review our institutions ' outcomes of surgical PDA ligation. All neonates with operative weight<symptom> of â‰¤ 1.00 kg undergoing surgical PDA ligation from 2003 to 2015 were analyzed. Records were queried to identify surgical complications , perioperative morbidity , and mortality. Outcomes included pre- and postoperative ventilator requirements , pre- and postoperative inotropic support , acute kidney injury , surgical complications , and 30-day mortality. One hundred sixty-six preterm neonates underwent surgical ligation. One hundred twenty-one ( 70.3 %) had failed indomethacin closure. One hundred sixty-four ( 98.8 %) patients required mechanical ventilation prior to surgery. At 17 postoperative days , freedom from the ventilator reached 50 %. Of 109 ( 66.4 %) patients requiring prolonged preoperative inotropic support , 59 ( 54.1 %) were liberated from inotropes by postoperative day 1. Surgical morbidity was encountered in four neonates ( 2.4 %): two ( 1.2 %) patients had a postoperative pneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy , one ( 0.6 %) patient had a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury , and one ( 0.6 %) patient had significant intraoperative bleeding. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 1.8 % ( n = 3); no deaths occurred intraoperatively. In this retrospective investigation , surgical PDA closure was associated with low 30-day mortality and minimal morbidity and resulted in rapid discontinuation of inotropic support and weaning from mechanical ventilation. Given the safety of this intervention , surgical PDA ligation merits consideration in the management strategy of the preterm neonate with a PDA.
