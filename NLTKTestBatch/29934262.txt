 The endoscope and microscope can be used conjointly in certain sites , such as middle ear cholesteatoma or for resection of cerebellopontine angle tumours. Petrous apex tumours are classically accessed via a lateral otological approach , or , for the most anterior tumours , via an endonasal endoscopic approach. Surgical access via a lateral incision is limited inferiorly by the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein , medially by the labyrinth , facial<symptom> nerve and internal auditory canal , superiorly by the dura mater , and laterally by the internal carotid artery. Via an anterior endonasal approach , the corridor formed by the internal carotid artery and the paraclival dura limits access to the posterior part of the petrous apex , restricting this approach to certain cholesterol granulomas<disease> or small cholesteatomas. None of these approaches , on its own , is sufficient in the case of an extensive petrous apex lesion<symptom>. The objective of this technical note is to describe the combined microscopic/endoscopic approach comprising sequential use of the microscope and the endoscope via a lateral approach for the management of large petrous apex lesions<symptom>.
