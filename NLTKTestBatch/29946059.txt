 BACKGROUND Systemic inflammation plays a critical role in the pathophysiological process of intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH). Recently , the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR) has become a research focus that indicates inflammation in various diseases<disease>. Thus , this study aimed to investigate the predictive value of PLR in patients with acute ICH. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was performed in a single teaching hospital. Glasgow coma<symptom> scale at hospital discharge ( GCSdis) and modified Rankin score ( MRS) at 6 months were recorded as short-term and long-term neurological outcomes. Ordered and binary logistic regression methods were used to explore the associations. RESULTS Finally , data on 183 ICH patients were included. A knot of PLR around 100 was detected and applied in the extended ordered logistic regression models. For PLR > 100 , PLR on ICU admission was significantly associated with worse GCSdis ( from Model 1: OR: 1.004 , 95 % CI 1.001-1.007 to Model 4: OR: 1.006 , 95 % CI 1.002-1.009) while the PLR on Emergency Department ( ED) admission was insignificant. For PLR â‰¤ 100 , neither the PLR on ICU or ED admission was associated with GCSdis level. In the quartile grouping analysis , PLR Q2 was used as a reference level. Both Q3 and Q4 on ICU admission were significantly associated with lower GCSdis level ( OR , 3.30; 95 % CI 1.38-7.88; and OR , 3.79; 95 % CI 1.54-9.33 , respectively) , while Q1 was insignificant. All 4 quartiles of PLR on ED admission were not associated with GCSdis. CONCLUSIONS Only higher PLR value on ICU admission but not on ED admission was associated with worse GCSdis.
