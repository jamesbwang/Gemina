 The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the ginsenoside metabolite compound K ( CK) and its mechanisms. Mice model of xylene-induced ear swelling and rat model of carrageenan-induced paw swelling were used to evaluate the effect of CK on acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. The analgesic effect of CK was evaluated on heat- , acetic acid- , and carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia. The levels of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2) , cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX-1) , and COX-2 in carrageenan-induced rat paw swelling and gastric mucosa<pathogen> were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). COX-1 and COX-2 expressions in carrageenan-induced rat paw swelling and gastric mucosa<pathogen> were detected by western blotting. In vitro effect of CK ( 10 CK at doses of 7 , 14 , 28 , 56 , 112 , and 224 mg/kg alleviated xylene-induced ear oedema , whereas CK at 40 , 80 , and 160 mg/kg alleviated carrageenan-induced paw oedema. CK at 224 mg/kg showed an analgesic effect against acetic acid-induced pain. CK at 40 , 80 , and 160 mg/kg significantly increased rat inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> threshold , but had no effect on heat-induced pain threshold. CK at 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 , and 160 mg/kg reduced PGE2 level in the paw tissue , but showed no effect on that in the gastric mucosa<pathogen>. CK at 20 , 40 , 80 , and 160 mg/kg decreased COX-2 expression in the paw tissue and gastric mucosa<pathogen> , but exhibited no effect on COX-1 expression or on COX-1 and COX-2 activities. CK exerted anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects , possibly by reducing the catalytic synthesis of PGE2 via downregulation of COX-2 expression.
