 Chronic kidney disease<disease> ( CKD) is a common complication after liver transplantation ( LT). The etiology of CKD is broad and may only be assessed accurately by renal histology. The current study aimed to analyze the safety of renal biopsy in daily clinical practice as well as its usefulness regarding management of CKD after LT. We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data and renal biopsies obtained from patients with severe renal impairment ( overt proteinuria<symptom> , progressive deterioration of renal function) after LT with respect to safety , etiology of renal disease<disease> , and therapeutic consequences. Renal biopsies were obtained from 14 patients at median ( minimum-maximum) 3 ( 0.2-12) years after LT. No major complications associated with renal biopsy were observed. Histomorphological alterations were varied ( nephrosclerosis , n = 5; IgA-glomerulonephritis , n = 4; tenofovir-associated nephropathy , membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis<disease> type 1 , membranous glomerulonephritis<disease> , amyloid A amyloidosis , and calcineurin inhibitor nephropathy , n = 1 , respectively). The diagnosis of specific renal diseases<disease> other than calcineurin-inhibitor nephrotoxicity facilitated specific treaments and avoided unnecessary modification of immunosuppression in the majority of patients. Renal biopsy in patients with CKD after LT seems safe and may offer specific therapeutic options. Furthermore , unnecessary changes of immunosuppression can be avoided in a considerable number of patients.
