 The utility of surgical simulation with three-dimensional multimodality fusion imaging ( 3D-MFI) has been demonstrated. However , its potential in deep-seated brain lesions<symptom> remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of 3D-MFI in deep-seated meningioma operations. Fourteen patients with deeply located meningiomas were included in this study. We constructed 3D-MFIs by fusing high-resolution magnetic resonance ( MR) and computed tomography ( CT) images with a rotational digital subtraction angiogram ( DSA) in all patients. The surgical procedure was simulated by 3D-MFI prior to operation. To assess the impact on neurosurgical education , the objective values of surgical simulation by 3D-MFIs/virtual reality ( VR) video were evaluated. To validate the quality of 3D-MFIs , intraoperative findings were compared. The identification rate ( IR) and positive predictive value ( PPV) for the tumor feeding arteries and involved perforating arteries and veins were also assessed for quality assessment of 3D-MFI. After surgical simulation by 3D-MFIs , near-total resection was achieved in 13 of 14 ( 92.9 %) patients without neurological complications. 3D-MFIs significantly contributed to the understanding of surgical anatomy and optimal surgical view ( p < .0001) and learning how to preserve critical vessels ( p < .0001) and resect tumors safety and extensively ( p < .0001) by neurosurgical residents/fellows. The IR of 3D-MFI for tumor-feeding arteries and perforating arteries and veins was 100 % and 92.9 % , respectively. The PPV of 3D-MFI for tumor-feeding arteries and perforating arteries and veins was 98.8 % and 76.5 % , respectively. 3D-MFI contributed to learn skull base meningioma surgery. Also , 3D-MFI provided high quality to identify critical anatomical structures within or adjacent to deep-seated meningiomas. Thus , 3D-MFI is promising educational and surgical planning tool for meningiomas in deep-seated regions.
