 Neuromyelitis optica ( NMO) and myasthenia gravis ( MG) are autoimmune diseases<disease> mediated by autoantibodies against either aquaporin 4 ( AQP4) or acetylcholine receptor ( AChR) , respectively. Recently , we and others have reported an increased prevalence of NMO in patients with MG. To verify whether coexisting autoimmune disease<disease> may exacerbate experimental autoimmune MG , we tested whether active immunization with AQP4 peptides or passive transfer of NMO-Ig can affect the severity of EAMG. Injection of either AQP4 peptide or NMO-Ig to EAMG or to naive mice caused increased fatigability and aggravation of EAMG symptoms<symptom> as expressed by augmented muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> ( but not paralysis) , decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation , increased neuromuscular jitter , and aberration of immune responses. Thus , our study shows increased disease<disease> severity in EAMG mice following immunization with the NMO autoantigen AQP4 or by NMO-Ig , mediated by augmented inflammatory response. This can explain exacerbation or increased susceptibility of patients with one autoimmune disease<disease> to develop additional autoimmune syndrome<symptom>.
