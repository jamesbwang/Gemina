 The purpose of this study was to compare preoperative variables and postoperative outcomes between flap tears with and without incarceration of inferiorly displaced fragments of medial meniscus and find distinct features of incarcerated flap tear of medial meniscus to improve preoperative diagnosis. 79 patients who underwent partial meniscectomy for flap tear of medial meniscus were classified into two groups: group U , usual flap tear without incarcerated fragment; group I , flap tear with incarcerated inferiorly displaced fragment. Patient characteristics and preoperative variables including duration of symptom<symptom> aggravation were investigated. A comprehensive physical examination including joint line tenderness<symptom> was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) examination was carried out on all patients. Clinical assessments were performed with functional scores including visual analogue scale ( VAS) , and radiologic evaluation was conducted. Preoperative values and postoperative outcomes measured at the minimum follow-up duration of 2 years were compared between the groups. The groups did not differ significantly regarding postoperative outcomes by functional and radiological evaluations (
