 The relation between driving pressure ( plateau pressure-positive end-expiratory pressure) and mortality has never been studied in obese ARDS patients. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 90-day mortality and driving pressure in an ARDS population ventilated in the intensive care unit ( ICU) according to obesity status<symptom>. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of prospectively collected data of all ARDS patients admitted consecutively to a mixed medical-surgical adult ICU from January 2009 to May 2017. Plateau pressure , compliance of the respiratory system ( Crs) and driving pressure of the respiratory system within 24 h of ARDS diagnosis were compared between survivors and non-survivors at day 90 and between obese ( body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m Three hundred sixty-two ARDS patients were included , 262 ( 72 %) non-obese and 100 ( 28 %) obese patients. Mortality rate at day 90 was respectively 47 % ( 95 % CI , 40-53) in the non-obese and 46 % ( 95 % CI , 36-56) in the obese patients. Driving pressure at day 1 in the non-obese patients was significantly lower in survivors at day 90 ( 11.9 ± 4.2 cmH Contrary to non-obese ARDS patients , driving pressure was not associated with mortality in obese ARDS patients.
