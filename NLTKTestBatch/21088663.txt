 Group B streptococcus<pathogen> ( GBS) is an organism that has an immense global impact on neonatal morbidity and mortality. GBS is known to colonize the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts<symptom> of infected pregnant women. Transmission to the neonate is achieved during labor and delivery. Complications of neonatal<disease> infection<disease>infection<disease> include sepsis<disease> , meningitis<disease> , and pneumonia<disease>. Preventative measures are needed to reduce the disease<disease> burden. The current method of prophylaxis being utilized is intrapartum antibiotics. Though effective , it presents limitations that include a required , lengthy duration of treatment , increased antibiotic resistance , and lack of late-onset disease<disease> coverage. Recent studies are exploring alternative methods of prophylaxis such as vaccination. Vaccination provides coverage of both early and late-onset disease<disease> to infected women who are unable to complete the required four hours of antibiotic course intrapartum , women with resistance to antibiotic infections<disease> , and women delivering in resource-poor areas without access to antibiotics. An investigational CRM197 conjugated trivalent vaccine has shown a good immunogenicity profile against the three most prevalent serotypes. The vaccine induced antibodies freely cross the placenta and persist in a neonate for up to 90 days after birth. Additionally , the vaccine possesses a safety profile free of any serious systemic adverse effects and only mild<symptom> pain<symptom> at the injection site. Future studies should focus on investigating the effect of the vaccine on maternal rectovaginal acquisition and subsequent vaginal colonization , as well as the expansion of vaccine coverage to all 10 serotypes identified worldwide in order to facilitate its use in resource-poor areas of the world with inadequate antibiotic availability. If available , such a vaccine can serve as an effective supplement to current guidelines of antibiotic prophylaxis against GBS in peripartum women and their neonates.
