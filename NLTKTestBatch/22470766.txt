 We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who developed an acute type B aortic dissection caused by an entry tear from an aneurysmal left common iliac artery that extended retrograde to the proximal descending thoracic aorta. She experienced refractory chest<symptom> pain<symptom> despite optimal medical management , thereby indicating repair. Endovascular aortic repair was subsequently performed. Intraoperatively , fibromuscular dysplasia was diagnosed by the characteristic appearance of her renal arteries. The patient tolerated the procedure and had resolution of her chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. In summary , we present a highly unusual case of type B aortic dissection resulting from a retrograde common iliac artery tear in a patient with fibromuscular dysplasia.
