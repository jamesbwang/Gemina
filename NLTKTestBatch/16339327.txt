 Despite the growing number of octogenarians , little is known about their vitamin D status<symptom> and activities of daily living ( ADL) relations. The aim of this study was to investigate peculiarities of vitamin D and ADL and to assess their relations in octogenarians. A cross-sectional study was performed at the National Osteoporosis Centre located in Vilnius , Lithuania. Community-dwelling ambulatory persons aged ≥ 80 years were included. Current users of vitamin D supplements were excluded. Total 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentration in serum was measured with Cobas E411. Functional status<symptom> was assessed by Katz ADL and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL) scales. Subjects were divided into three groups according to age and into two groups according to vitamin D level. One-way analysis of variance with The study was performed on 153 octogenarians: 81 ( 52.9 %) women and 72 ( 47.1 %) men. The average age of subjects was 83.9 ± 3.2 years. Mean total 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 11.2 ± 7.0 ng/ml; 137 ( 89.5 %) persons had vitamin D deficiency , 12 ( 7.8 %) had insufficiency , and only 4 ( 2.6 %) persons were vitamin D sufficient. Positive weak correlation between total 25 hydroxyvitamin D and ADL score ( The majority of investigated octogenarians had vitamin D deficiency. The level of vitamin D was associated with the ADL score. There was no association between the vitamin D level and the IADL score , although a weak correlation was found between vitamin D level and category of food preparation.
