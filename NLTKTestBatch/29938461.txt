 Regulatory dendritic cells ( rDCs) , which can be induced by mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) , play an important role in inducing and maintaining homeostasis of regulatory T cells and exhibit anti-inflammatory functions. In this study , we investigated whether MSCs could differentiate DCs into rDCs and compared the therapeutic effects of rDCs and MSCs on dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS)- induced chronic colitis<disease> mice. Immature DCs ( imDCs) and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- treated mature DCs ( mDCs) were co-cultured with MSCs for 48 hours , and then the profiles of surface markers and cytokines and regulatory roles of these DCs for primary splenocytes were analyzed. In addition , the therapeutic effects of MSCs and DCs co-cultured with MSCs were compared in chronic colitis<disease> mice. After co-culture of imDCs ( MSC-DCs) or LPS-treated mDCs ( LPS+MSC- DCs) with MSCs , the expression of CD11c , CD80 , CD86 , interleukin 6 ( IL-6) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) , and interferon-γ ( IFN-γ) , was decreased , but that of CD11b , IL-10 , and transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) was increased. Furthermore , MSC-DCs and LPS+MSC- DCs induced the expression of CD4 , CD25 , and Foxp3 in primary splenocytes isolated from mice. In DSS-induced colitis<disease> mice , MSCs and MSC-DCs increased colon length , body<symptom> weight , and survival rate and induced histological improvement. Moreover , in the colon tissues , the expression of IL-6 , TNF-α , and IFN-γ decreased , but that of IL-10 , TGF-β , and Foxp3 increased in the MSC- and MSC-DC-injected groups. Our data suggest that MSCs differentiate DCs into rDCs , which ameliorate chronic colitis<disease>. Thus , rDCs stimulated by MSCs may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>.
