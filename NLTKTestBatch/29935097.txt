 Since the 1970s , a range of facial , neurostructural , and neurocognitive adverse effects have been shown to be associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Typically , these effects are studied individually and not in combination. Our objective is to improve the understanding of the teratogenic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure by simultaneously considering face-brain morphology and neurocognitive measures. Participants were categorized as control ( n = 47) , fetal alcohol syndrome<symptom> ( FAS , n = 22) , or heavily exposed ( HE) prenatally , but not eligible for a FAS diagnosis ( HE , n = 50). Structural brain MRI images and high-resolution 3D facial images were analyzed using dense surface models of features of the face and surface shape of the corpus callosum ( CC) and caudate nucleus ( CN). Asymmetry of the CN was evaluated for correlations with neurocognitive measures. ( i) Facial growth delineations for FAS , HE , and controls are replicated for the CN and the CC. ( ii) Concordance of clinical diagnosis and face-based control-FAS discrimination improves when the latter is combined with specific brain regions. In particular , midline facial regions discriminate better when combined with a midsagittal profile of the CC. ( iii) A subset of HE individuals was identified with FAS-like CN dysmorphism. The average of this HE subset was FAS-like in its facial dysmorphism. ( iv) Right-left asymmetry found in the CNs of controls is not apparent for FAS , is diminished for HE , and correlates with neurocognitive measures in the combined FAS and HE population. Shape analysis which combines facial regions with the CN , and with the CC , better identify those with FAS. CN asymmetry was reduced for FAS compared to controls and is strongly associated with general cognitive ability , verbal learning , and recall in those with prenatal alcohol exposure. This study further extends the brain-behavior relationships known to be vulnerable to alcohol teratogenesis.
