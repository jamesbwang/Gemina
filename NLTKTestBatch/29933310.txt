 Cancer coordinators ( CCs) operate at both patient and system levels in order to provide patients with tailored and coordinated services. In common with international CCs , Norwegian CCs denote notable progress in their patient-focused work , while reporting ongoing challenges in carrying out system-focused tasks. However , little is known about the barriers and facilitators for CCs ' system-level work. The aim of this study was to explore Norwegian CCs ' experiences of barriers and facilitators for enacting system-focused tasks. The study applies a qualitative method , conducting an interpretative data inquiry of semistructured in-depth interviews with 26 Norwegian CCs. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis and discussed in light of previous research and salutogenic theory. The analyses revealed 3 main themes: ( 1) `` understanding the role and local cancer care , '' ( 2) `` systems for care delivery in primary healthcare , '' and ( 3) `` commitment to collaboration. '' Where present , the themes could represent important facilitators , whereas their absence could depict notable challenges to CCs system-focused work. Over time , as CCs were able to mobilize resources , they were able to gradually turn initial challenges into facilitators in the context of system-level work. Cancer coordinators encounter cognitive , practical , and relational topics that impact their system-focused activities. Adopting a salutogenic focus can help CCs mobilize resources needed to turn challenges into facilitators for system-level work. Cancer care coordination<symptom> can not be undertaken by CCs alone. Cancer coordinators ' embedding in multidisciplinary teams , common systems for care provision , meaningful work relations , and professionals ' commitment to cancer care represent important facilitators for CCs ' system-focused tasks.
