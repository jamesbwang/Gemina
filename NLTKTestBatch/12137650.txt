 Prevention of rheumatic heart disease<disease> ( RHD) remains challenging in high-burden settings globally. After acute rheumatic fever<symptom> ( ARF) , secondary antibiotic prophylaxis is required to prevent RHD. International guidelines on recommended durations of secondary prophylaxis differ , with scope for clinician discretion. Because ARF risk decreases with age , ongoing prophylaxis is generally considered unnecessary beyond approximately the third decade. Concordance with guidelines on timely cessation of prophylaxis is unknown. We undertook a register-based audit to determine the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis among clients aged ≥ 35 years in Australia 's Northern Territory. Data on demographics , ARF episode ( s) , RHD severity , prophylaxis type , and relevant clinical notes were extracted. The determination of guideline concordance was based on whether ( 1) national guidelines were followed; ( 2) a reason for departure from guidelines was documented; ( 3) lifelong continuation was considered appropriate in all cases of severe RHD. We identified 343 clients aged ≥ 35 years prescribed secondary prophylaxis. Guideline concordance was 39 % according to national guidelines , 68 % when documented reasons for departures from guidelines were included and 82 % if patients with severe RHD were deemed to need lifelong prophylaxis. Shorter times since last echocardiogram or cardiologist review were associated with greater likelihood of guideline concordance ( In this setting , appropriate discontinuation of RHD prophylaxis could be improved through timely specialist review to reduce unnecessary burden on clients and health systems.
