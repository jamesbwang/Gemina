 This article reviews the effectiveness of intratympanic corticosteroids for vertigo<symptom> control in Ménière 's disease<disease> at 2-years follow-up according to the guidelines expressed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery. Despite the increased use of intratympanic corticosteroids for vertigo<symptom> control in Ménière 's disease<disease> there is debate as to their effectiveness , particularly compared to gentamicin. Even so , after just a single course of injections , corticosteroids can reliably provide complete vertigo<symptom> control ( Class A) at 2-years in about 50 % of cases as indicated in a recent double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial ( Patel et al. , 2016). But the effectiveness of intratympanic corticosteroids truly increases when treatment is provided ` as-needed ' , whereby complete vertigo<symptom> control is established in up to 91 % of cases. On the basis of available literature , there is good evidence to recommend the use of intratympanic steroid treatment for vertigo<symptom> control in Ménière 's disease<disease> , but patients must be monitored for non-response. The rationale for treating patients as-needed and the possible reasons for corticosteroid non-response are discussed.
