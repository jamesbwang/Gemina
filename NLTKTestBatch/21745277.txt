 Chronic Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> Virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection has been commonly linked to the development of autoimmunity , in part through activation of B cells. B cells are also postulated to play a pathogenic role in the autoimmune liver disease<disease> Primary Biliary Cholangitis ( PBC). Patients with concurrent PBC and HCV<pathogen> infection carry an increased risk of more progressive disease<disease> , although the mechanism underlying this effect is poorly understood. Utilizing a case series of patients with concurrent PBC and HCV<pathogen> , the aim of this study was to evaluate for the potential impact of HCV<pathogen> eradication upon autoimmunity/autoantibody production. A case series evaluating three patients with co-existing PBC-HCV infection receiving non-interferon based HCV<pathogen> treatments with direct-acting antivirals ( DAA). One of three patient received Ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA; 13 mg/kg/day) during the treatment period. Sustained virological response ( SVR) to DAA 's was assessed using a HCV<pathogen> Quantitative Nucleic Acid Test ( Abbott). Autoantibodies associated with autoimmune liver diseases<disease> ( including PBC) and liver biochemistry , were measured before , during and after DAA treatment ( Mitogen Advanced Diagnostics Laboratory , Calgary , Canada). All patients achieved an SVR , as determined by negative HCV<pathogen> RNA test 12 weeks post-DAA therapy. Titres of anti-mitochondrial antibodies ( AMA-M2) , anti- branched-chain 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complex and 2-oxo glutarate dehydrogenase complex ( anti-3E-BPO) , and anti- tripartite motif-containing protein 21 ( TRIM21/Ro52) remained unchanged , despite successful HCV<pathogen> eradication. Two of the three patients exhibited a transient decrease in some autoantibody titres during DAA treatment , but these returned to baseline levels post-DAA therapy. Within the limitations of a case series , our results suggest that HCV<pathogen> co-infection may not be a significant driver of PBC-related autoimmunity/autoantibody production. However , a larger n-value is required to truly assess for the effect of HCV<pathogen> eradication on autoantibody production.
