 A hitherto unknown low molecular weight<symptom> form of α-galactosidase ( VM-αGal) from germinating black gram ( Vigna mungo) seeds was purified to homogeneity ( 432 U/mg specific activity , 1542-fold purification) using ion-exchange ( DEAE-cellulose , CM-sepharose) and affinity ( Con-A Sepharose 4B) chromatography. VM-αGal appeared as a single band ~ 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE and showed optimal activity at pH 5 and 55 °C. Hg
