 Riemerella anatipestifer ( R. anatipestifer , RA) is an important bacterial pathogen of ducks and other birds; infection<disease> with RA causes high poultry mortality and heavy economic losses<symptom> in the poultry industry. However , the pathogenesis of this bacterium<pathogen> is poorly understood , in part due to the lack of a suitable array of methods for genetic manipulation. In this study , we first examined the efficacy of the mutated pheS gene ( pheS *) as a counterselectable marker in R. anatipestifer. A suicide vector carrying pheS * , pOES , was constructed and used for markerless deletion of the gene RA0C_2053 which encode a putative TonB-dependent receptor in RA ATCC11845. The suicide plasmid pOES was also used to introduce a `` knock-in '' Myc-tag into the C-terminus of RA0C_1912 which encode a putative Fur protein. Using pheS * as a counterselectable marker , markerless mutagenesis and `` knock-in '' genetic manipulation techniques were also developed based on natural transformation. Furthermore , this marker was used to generate a point mutation in the RA0C_1912 gene of the RA ATCC11845 genome. The genetic methods developed in this study provide new and useful tools required to investigate the physiology and pathogenic mechanisms of this bacterium<pathogen>. These techniques may also have wider application in many other members of the Flavobacteria<pathogen>.
