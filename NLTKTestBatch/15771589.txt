 Despite development in the understanding of the pathogenesis of acute lung injury ( ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome<symptom> ( ARDS) , the underlying mechanism still needs to be elucidated. Apart from leukocytes and endothelial cells , macrophages are also essential for the process of the inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS. Notably , macrophages play a dual role of proinflammation and anti-inflammation based on the microenvironment in different pathological stages. In the acute phase of ALI/ARDS , resident alveolar macrophages , typically expressing the alternatively activated phenotype ( M2) , shift into the classically activated phenotype ( M1) and release various potent proinflammatory mediators. In the later phase , the M1 phenotype of activated resident and recruited macrophages shifts back to the M2 phenotype for eliminating apoptotic cells and participating in fibrosis<disease>. In this review , we summarize the main subsets of macrophages and the associated signaling pathways in three different pathological phases of ALI/ARDS. According to the current literature , regulating the function of macrophages and monocytes might be a promising therapeutic strategy against ALI/ARDS.
