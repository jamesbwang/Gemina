 To assess feasibility of producing intelligible and comprehensible speech with an electrolarynx; measure anxiety<symptom> , communication ease , and satisfaction before/after electrolarynx training; and identify barriers/facilitators. We included tracheostomized adults from 3 units following commands , reading English , and mouthing words. On enrolment , we measured anxiety<symptom> , ease , and satisfaction with communication. We gave electrolarynx instruction for â‰¤ 5 days then 2 independent raters assessed intelligibility , sentence comprehensibility ( 9-point difficulty scale) , and Electrolarynx Effectiveness Score ( EES) , and re-evaluated anxiety<symptom> , communication ease , and satisfaction. Interviews explored barriers/facilitators. We recruited 24 participants ( Jan2015-Dec2016). Mean ( SD) intelligibility was 45 % ( 18 %) words correct: 57 % ( 21 %) when facing. Mean comprehension difficulty was 6.4 ( 2.0) overall , indicating moderate difficulty ( 5.5 ( 2.5) scored visualizing). Mean EES was 2.9 ( 1.0) ( 3 = improved lip-reading through recognizable sounds<symptom>). Anxiety<symptom> decreased from median 3.8 to 2.0 ( P = .007). Communication was rated easier ( median 15 vs 12 , P = .04) whereas satisfaction remained similar ( P = .06). Facilitators included device friendliness , patient independence , and word intelligibility. Barriers were patient weakness<symptom> , difficulty positioning the device , and limited sentence as opposed to word intelligibility. The electrolarynx may aid intelligible speech for some tracheostomized patients if the communication partner can visualize the users face , and reduce anxiety<symptom> and make patient perceived communication easier.
