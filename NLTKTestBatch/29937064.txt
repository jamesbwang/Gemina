 Penile intra-epithelial neoplasia ( PIN) are precancerous lesions<symptom> , characterized by architectural and cytological abnormalities of the genital epithelium , from which can arise squamous carcinomas. A literature review was performed on the Medline database , considering the articles listed between October 2007 and October 2017 dealing with PIN , using the following keywords `` intraepithelial neoplasia '' or `` Bowen 's disease<disease> '' or `` erythroplasia of Queyrat '' or `` bowenoid papulosis '' and `` penis ''. Papers were selected according to their language ( English and French) and their relevance. One hundred seventy four articles related to PIN were listed. Twenty-five of them were selected for their relevance. The analysis of the references of these articles identified 6 relevant papers published before October 2007 , which were considered for this review based on a total of thirty-one articles. We describe clinical and pathological characteristics of PIN , emphasizing treatment modalities. Urologists should distinguish HPV-related and non HPV-related PIN , both of them sharing clinical presentation , but needing different management.
