 Flight attendants are an understudied occupational group , despite undergoing a wide range of adverse job-related exposures , including to known carcinogens. In our study , we aimed to characterize the prevalence of cancer diagnoses among U.S. cabin crew relative to the general population. In 2014-2015 , we surveyed participants of the Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study. We compared the prevalence of their self-reported cancer diagnoses to a contemporaneous cohort in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES 2013-2014) using age-weighted standardized prevalence ratios ( SPRs). We also analyzed associations between job tenure and the prevalence of selected cancers , using logistic regression and adjusting for potential confounders. Compared to NHANES participants with a similar socioeconomic status<symptom> ( n = 2729) , flight attendants ( n = 5366) had a higher prevalence of every cancer we examined , especially breast cancer , melanoma , and non-melanoma skin cancer among females. SPR for these conditions were 1.51 ( 95 % CI: 1.02 , 2.24) , 2.27 ( 95 % CI: 1.27 , 4.06) , and 4.09 ( 95 % CI: 2.70 , 6.20) , respectively. Job tenure was positively related to non-melanoma skin cancer among females , with borderline associations for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers among males. Consistent with previous studies , we observed associations between job tenure and breast cancer among women who had three or more children. We observed higher rates of specific cancers in flight attendants compared the general population , some of which were related to job tenure. Our results should be interpreted in light of self-reported health information and a cross-sectional study design. Future longitudinal studies should evaluate associations between specific exposures and cancers among cabin crew.
