 Sleep spindles are brief oscillatory events during non-rapid eye<symptom> movement<symptom> ( NREM) sleep. Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance , suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here , using computational models , we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First , we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system , projecting superficially , has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system , which projects to middle layers , and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers , as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast , spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously , as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore , consistent with human recordings , in the model , spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system , leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of intra- and inter-cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increased spindle density as has been observed during learning.
