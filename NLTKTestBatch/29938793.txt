 The infectious salmon anaemia virus<pathogen> ( ISAV) is capable of causing a significant disease<disease> in Atlantic<disease> salmon , which has resulted in considerable financial losses<symptom> for salmon farmers around the world. Since the first detection of ISAV in Canada in 1996 , it has been a high priority for aquatic animal health management and surveillance programmes have led to the identification of many genetically distinct ISAV isolates of variable virulence. In this study , we evaluated the virulence of three ISAV isolates detected in Atlantic Canada in 2012 by doing in vivo-controlled disease<disease> challenges with two sources of Atlantic<disease> salmon. We measured viral loads in fish tissues during the course of infection. Sequences of the full viral RNA genomes of these three ISAV isolates were obtained and compared to a high-virulence and previously characterized isolate detected in the Bay of Fundy in 2004 , as well as a newly identified ISAV NA-HPR0 isolate. All three ISAV isolates studied were shown to be of low<symptom> to mid-virulence with fish from source A having a lower mortality rate than fish from source B. Viral load estimation using an RT-qPCR assay targeting viral segment 8 showed a high degree of similarity between tissues. Through genomic comparison , we identified various amino acid substitutions unique to some isolates , including a stop codon in the segment 8 ORF2 not previously reported in ISAV , present in the isolate with the lowest observed virulence.
