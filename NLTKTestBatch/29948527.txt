 To address the limited research on diverse families of children with ASD , we examined the impact of ASD on 46 Latina and 56 non-Latina White<symptom> mothers from a resiliency perspective. We explored perceptions of family problems , optimism and pessimism among mothers of child with ASD between 1 and 22 years old. Mothers were recruited through support groups and listservs. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Results indicated fewer perceived family problems and less pessimism about the child 's future among Latina mothers. We found maternal optimism and family cohesion were associated with perceived family problems and mother 's pessimism about the child 's future. Understanding the impact of ASD among diverse families will aid in developing appropriate services that enhances family strengths.
