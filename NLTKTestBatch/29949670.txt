 Although there is much research on mental health nurses working with individuals presenting with psychosis , there is a lack of knowledge about the factors that impact the experience of nurses in the presentation specifically of first time psychosis. This study aims to explore the factors that impact on the experience of mental health nurses working with individuals and their families who present with a first time psychosis. This qualitative study was conducted through individual semi-structured interviews with eight mental health nurses recruited from community mental health settings with a minimum of two years post qualification experience. Data was then subjected to a thematic content analysis. This study identified the importance of therapeutic engagement , as well as the need to have clear pathways to care and building capacity through clinical supervision and training when working with this population. Mental<symptom> Health nurses should engage with additional training , formalized clinical supervision and avail of peer support in order to improve confidence , skills and quality of care , leading to better therapeutic engagement. Pathways to care should be embedded within the wider community to ensure ease of access for individual and their families. There should be more recognition of the social impact on the individual during untreated psychosis with regards to isolation and withdrawal<symptom> as well as factors which also affect help-seeking behaviours.
