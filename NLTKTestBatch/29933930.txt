 Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is common in triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) and affects the expression of genes controlling immune signaling. A subset of TNBC cases will have somatic amplification of chromosome 9p24 .1 , encoding PD-L1 , PD-L2 , and JAK2 , which has been associated with decreased survival. Eleven TNBC cell lines were evaluated using array comparative genomic hybridization. A copy number gain was defined as an array comparative genomic hybridization log The cell line HCC70 had 9p24 .1 copy number amplification that was associated with both increased JAK2 and pSTAT3; however , knockdown of JAK2 inhibited cell growth independently of 9p24 .1 copy number status<symptom>. In TNBC cell lines with 9p24 .1 gain or amplification , PD-L1 expression rapidly and strikingly increased 5- to 38-fold with interferon-γ ( P < .05) , and inducible PD-L1 expression was completely blocked by JAK2 knockdown and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. In tumor tissue , expression of interferon-γ-related genes correlated with 9p24 .1 copy number status<symptom>. These data suggest that the JAK2/STAT1 pathway in TNBC might regulate the dynamic expression of PD-L1 that is induced in the setting of an inflammatory response. Inhibition of JAK2 might provide a synergistic therapy when combined with other immunotherapies in the subset of TNBC with 9p24 .1 amplification.
