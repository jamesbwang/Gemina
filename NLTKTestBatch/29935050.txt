 Antiviral therapy to eradicate hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection improves outcomes in patients undergoing liver transplantation ( LT) for advanced chronic HCV<pathogen> with or without hepatocellular carcinoma. Traditionally , antiviral therapy focused on the use of interferon ( IFN)- based regimens , with antiviral treatment initiated in the posttransplant period once recurrent HCV<pathogen> disease<disease> with fibrosis<disease> in the allograft was identified. The use of IFN-based therapy was limited in pretransplant patients with advanced liver disease<disease>. Earlier intervention , either before transplantation or early after LT , is now feasible with the advent of second-generation direct-acting antiviral agents ( DAAs) with superior tolerability and efficacy to IFN-based therapy. These agents have the potential to reduce the number of patients developing HCV-related complications requiring LT and retransplantation , as well as reducing the demand for donor organs. We discuss the pros and cons of pretransplant , peritransplant , and posttransplant therapy with current DAAs , citing available data from clinical trials and real-world experience.
