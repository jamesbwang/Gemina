 Caffeine can exacerbate tremor<symptom>. Reducing caffeine intake or switching to decaffeinated beverages can lessen tremor<symptom>. Unaffected relatives of essential tremor<symptom> ( ET) cases often have mild , subclinical tremor<symptom>. One question is whether the coffee and tea consumption pattern in these individuals differs from that of controls ( Co). We ascertained the patterns of coffee and tea intake using a structured questionnaire , and compared the use in unaffected first-degree relatives of ET cases ( FD-ET) to the use in age-matched Co.. Three measures of relative caffeinated coffee + tea to decaffeinated coffee + tea were constructed. Caffeine index 1 = ( cups of caffeinated coffee + tea)- ( cups of decaffeinated coffee + tea) consumed on the day of evaluation. Caffeine index 2 = ( cups of caffeinated coffee + tea)- ( cups of decaffeinated coffee + tea) consumed in a typical month. The percentage of coffee and tea that was caffeinated in a typical month was also calculated. There were 263 individuals ( 190 FD-ET , 73 Co). Caffeine index 1 in FD-ET was less than 1-half that of Co ( p = 0.001). Caffeine index 2 was similarly lower in FD-ET than Co ( p = 0.027). The percentage of coffee and tea that was caffeinated in a typical month was also significantly lower in FD-ET than Co ( p = 0.018). The balance<symptom> of caffeinated to decaffeinated beverages is different in FD-ET than Co.. These data raise several intriguing questions. Among these is whether relatives of ET cases modify their caffeine consumption before disease<disease> onset.
