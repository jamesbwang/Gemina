 Data on the systemic dissemination in Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> bloodstream infection<disease> ( SAB) remain sparse. We investigated the timing and the sequence of clinical symptoms<symptom> , diagnostic confirmation , and occurrence of multiple infective foci in relation to three major infective foci. From 2006 to 2011 , all adult patients with first-time SAB in Cologne and Freiburg , Germany were followed prospectively. The study was restricted to patients with short-term central venous catheter ( CVC)- related SAB , vertebral osteomyelitis<disease> ( VO) , and infective endocarditis<disease> ( IE). The collection date of the first positive blood culture was used as reference point for determining time to onset of clinical symptoms<symptom> , microbiological findings , imaging results compatible with focal infection<disease> , and occurrence of additional infective foci. We included 266 patients with first-time SAB. Among patients with CVC-related SAB , clinical onset , collection of the first positive blood culture , and microbiological confirmation almost coincided. In contrast , among patients with VO or IE , the onset of clinical symptoms<symptom> most often preceded the collection of the first positive blood culture , and imaging and microbiological confirmation were most frequently obtained subsequent to the SAB diagnosis. CVC-related SAB was infrequently associated with further foci ( n = 15/15 .5 %). Conversely , more than one infective focus was observed in 44 ( 56.4 %) patient with VO and 68 ( 64.8 %) patients with IE. The sequence of clinical symptoms<symptom> , diagnostic confirmation , and occurrence of multiple infective foci varied considerably with different infective foci in SAB. Based on these results , we propose a pragmatic and evidence-based terminology for the clinical course of SAB and suggest the terms `` portal of entry '' , `` infective focus '' , `` multiple infective foci '' , and `` dominant infective focus ''.
