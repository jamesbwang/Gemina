 Primary duodenal cancer is a rare entity accounting for only 0.3 % of all gastrointestinal cancers. Histopathologically , most duodenal cancers are mucin-producing adenocarcinomas , 34 % being poorly differentiated. Signet-ring cell ( SRC) carcinoma is extremely uncommon in the duodenum. Herein , we report a rare case of SRC carcinoma associated with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the non-ampullary duodenum in a 74-year-old woman. The patient was admitted to the hospital for persistent epigastric pain , significant weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and hypochromic microcytic anemia<symptom>. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy revealed a protruded lesion<symptom> , with ulceration in the second portion of the duodenum , above the papilla. The patient was referred to surgery and pancreatico-duodenectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. The tumor consisted predominately of SRCs , Periodic Acid Schiff ( PAS)- Alcian blue positive. The tumor cells were CDX2 , cytokeratin ( CK) 7 and CK 18/8 positive , which suggested a primary upper gastrointestinal tract site of origin. Immunostaining for mucin ( MUC) 2 and MUC5AC was also positive demonstrating the duodenal goblet cells differentiation with a mixed gastric-foveolar and intestinal phenotype. Based on the morphological features and the immunohistochemical profile , a diagnosis of SRC carcinoma associated with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the non-ampullary duodenum was set.
