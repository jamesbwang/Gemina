 We report on the feasibility and functional outcome of transoral robotic ( TORS) supracricoid partial laryngectomy ( SCPL) with cricohyoidoepiglottopexy ( CHEP). Cadaveric studies and functional outcome at 3 years using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire ( EORTC-QLQ-H & N35) , the Functional Outcome Swallowing Scale ( FOSS) , the Performance Status<symptom> Scale for Head<disease> and<symptom> Neck Cancer ( PSS-HN) , computerized voice analysis , and videotape recordings. Data were compared with a historical cohort of open CHEPs/cricohyoidopexies ( CHPs). The EORTC-QLQ-H & N35 scores , FOSS scores , and PSS-HN scores at 3 years of 2 operated patients were 46 and 43 , 2 and 1 , and 75 of 100 ( eating in public) and 100 of 100 ( normalcy of diet) , respectively. The mean fundamental frequency , jitter , shimmer , noise-to-harmonic ratio ( NHR) , and maximum phonation time ( MPT) were 85 HZ and 81 Hz , 8.52 % and 6.39 % , 28.2 % and 13.5 % , 0.61 and 0.71 , 19 seconds and 15 seconds , respectively. Functional outcome data suggest that the procedure is feasible and safe.
