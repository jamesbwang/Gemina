 Ansamitocin P-3 ( AP-3) produced by Actinosynnema pretiosum is an important antitumor agent for cancer treatment , but its market supply suffers from a low<symptom> production<symptom> titer. The role of AP-3 unusual glycolate unit supply on its biosynthesis was investigated in this work by overexpressing the responsible gene cluster asm13-17 in A. pretiosum ( WT). As a result , the accumulation of AP-3 and its intermediate glyceryl-S-ACP in the asm13-17-overexpressed strain ( Oasm13-17) versus WT was enhanced by 1.94 and 1.49-fold , respectively. To provide a higher supply of another precursor 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid , asmUdpg was also overexpressed in Oasm13-17 ( Oasm13-17: asmUdpg) , and an improved AP-3 titer of 680.5 mg/L was achieved in shake flasks. To further enhance the AP-3 titer , a rational fed-batch strategy was developed in bioreactor fermentation of Oasm13-17: asmUdpg; and by pulse feeding 15 g/L fructose and 1.64 g/L isobutanol at 60 , 96 , and 120 hr , the AP-3 production level reached 757.7 mg/L , which is much higher than ever reported in bioreactors. This work demonstrated that a rational approach combining precursor pathway engineering with substrate feeding was very effective in enhancing the AP-3 titer , and this enabling methodology would be helpful to industrial production of this eye-catching drug.
