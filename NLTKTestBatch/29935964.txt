 Fatty acid binding protein 4 ( FABP4) is found to play a role in skeletal muscle homeostasis. Since the dysregulation of FABP4 and sarcopenia are both highly prevalent in patients on chronic hemodialysis ( HD) , the correlation between them remains unknown. We aimed to examine this relationship in a cross-sectional study. A total of 120 chronic HD patients were recruited , and whose skeletal muscle mass , handgrip strength , and gait speed were assessed and blood samples were obtained. We grouped these participants into sarcopenia ( n = 20) and non-sarcopenia groups according to European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People criteria. The sarcopenia group exhibited lower weight<symptom> ( P < 0.001) , height ( P = 0.019) , waist circumference ( P < 0.001) , body mass index ( P < 0.001) , body fat mass ( P = 0.004) , and lower serum triglycerides ( P = 0.009) , creatinine ( P < 0.001) , phosphorus ( P = 0.013) , intact parathyroid hormone ( P = 0.012) , and FABP4 concentrations ( P = 0.005) , and higher malnutrition-inflammation scores ( MIS) ( P = 0.031) , urea reduction rates ( P < 0.001) , and fractional clearance index for urea ( Kt/V) values ( P < 0.001). Serum FABP4 concentrations ( odds ratio ( OR): 0.98 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.96-0.99 , P = 0.043) , body fat mass ( OR: 0.86 , 95 % CI: 0.77-0.97 , P = 0.013) , MIS ( OR: 6.90 , 95 % CI: 1.31-36.36 , P = 0.023) , and Kt/V ( each increase of 0.1 , OR: 2.15 , 95 % CI: 1.29-3.57 , P = 0.003) were independent predictors of sarcopenia in chronic HD patients. We delineated the association between serum FABP4 concentrations and sarcopenia in chronic HD patients.
