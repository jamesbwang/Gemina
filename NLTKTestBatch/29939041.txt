 Both enduring neurotic vulnerabilities and economic hardship have been shown to negatively influence marital behaviors , which have physical and mental health consequences. However , because most previous research is fragmented and has focused on the early years of marriage or relatively short periods of time , their long-term effects are unclear. Using data from the Iowa Midlife Transitions Project , with a sample of 370 married couples providing data from 1991 to 2001 , we assessed enduring personal and couple vulnerabilities , trajectories of family economic hardship , and couples ' marital hostility using a comprehensive dyadic model to ascertain their influence on subsequent mental health. Couple marital hostility trajectories and neurotic vulnerabilities ( both additively and interactively) were associated with changes in both spouses ' depressive symptoms<symptom>. Results also indicated that couples ' marital hostility trajectories link trajectories of family economic hardship to subsequent changes in husbands ' and wives ' depressive symptoms<symptom>. Last , associations between economic hardship trajectories , marital hostility trajectories , and depressive symptoms<symptom> were moderated by couples ' neurotic vulnerability as captured by a product term of husbands ' and wives ' neurotic vulnerability. In general , these associations were amplified for couples with a high level of couple vulnerability and weakened ( or altogether absent) for those with a low level of vulnerability.
