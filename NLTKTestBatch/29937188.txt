 Patients with multiple myeloma ( MM) have an extremely heterogeneous prognosis. The International Staging System ( ISS) is actually the most reliable staging system and chromosomal abnormalities were integrated in the Revised-ISS. We wanted to evaluate the prognostic value of spinal secondary localization in patients with MM and its impact on the ISS. Epidemiological and biological data , as well as treatment protocols and secondary localization were analyzed for 650 consecutive patients diagnosed with MM from January 2006 to January 2017. The overall survival ( OS) was dependent on the WHO performance status<symptom> , ISS and Salmon and Durie stage at diagnosis. Furthermore , presence of spinal metastases at diagnosis was predictive of a worse outcome ( p < 0.0001) , while presence of peripheral bone metastases was not. Spinal metastases had a significant impact on OS for ISS III patients ( p < 0.0001). Also , a history of bone<disease> marrow graft was associated with a better OS ( p < 0.0001) , while radiotherapy had no significant impact. The multivariate analysis confirmed that the spinal metastases at diagnosis determined a high-risk subgroup for ISS III patients with a very poor OS ( p < 0.0001). Spinal metastases are a negative prognostic factor for patients with MM , especially for ISS III patients , and are associated with a shorter OS. Spinal metastasis should be systemically searched for and should be included in a modified staging system to better manage these patients.
