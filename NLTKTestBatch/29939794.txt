 Seaweeds are being consumed more often worldwide and are a source of essential minerals , fiber , vitamins , amino acids , and various bioactive compounds that have many beneficial effects on human health. However , marine pollution and the high capacity of seaweed to absorb metals may mean this food can also be dangerous to human health. The concentrations of some trace elements ( B , Ba , Fe , Ni , Li , and V) and toxic metals ( Al , Cd , and Pb) were determined in various species of wild seaweeds in the Phaeophyta group of brown algae<pathogen> from the Atlantic Ocean. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry revealed high concentrations of Al ( 256 mg/kg dry<symptom> weight<symptom>) , Pb ( 3.92 mg/kg dry<symptom> weight<symptom>) , and Cd ( 0.20 mg/kg dry<symptom> weight<symptom>) in Padina pavonica. Pb contributed the most to the tolerable daily intake ( TDI) of toxic metals in these samples; 57.2 and 45.3 % of the TDI for Pb was found in 5 g of dehydrated P. pavonica and Halopteris scoparia , respectively. This percent contribution is half of the recommended TDI for this metal , which is 34.24 Î¼g/day; therefore , high consumption of these species is discouraged. The maximum TDIs established by various institutions for the other metals were not exceeded from the daily consumption of 5 g of the other dehydrated seaweeds evaluated in this study.
