 Chest tube drainage with fibrinolytics is a cost-effective treatment option for parapneumonic effusion<symptom> and empyema<disease> in children. Although the additional use of ultrasound ( US) guidance is recommended , this is rarely performed in real time to direct drain insertion. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of real-time US-guided , radiologically placed chest drains at a tertiary university hospital. This was a retrospective review over a 16-year period of all children with parapneumonic effusion<symptom> or empyema<disease> undergoing percutaneous US-guided drainage at our centre. Three hundred and three drains were placed in 285 patients. Treatment was successful in 93 % of patients after a single drain ( 98.2 % success with 2 or 3 drains). Five children had peri-insertion complications , but none was significant. The success rate improved with experience. Although five patients required surgical intervention , all children treated since 2012 were successfully treated with single-tube drainage only and none has required surgery. Our technique for inserting small-bore ( â‰¤ 8.5 F) catheter drains under US guidance is effective and appears to be a safe procedure for first-line management of complicated parapneumonic effusion<symptom> and empyema<disease>.
