 Reaction-field ( RF) methods have been extensively used in molecular dynamics simulations to efficiently compute long-range electrostatic interactions. They assume a continuous dielectric medium outside a certain cutoff , which has shown to be a reasonable approximation in many cases. However , lattice sum or fast multipole methods are nowadays often used instead , which treat long-range interactions explicitly but may introduce different artefacts. In the following work , the major issue of RFs is addressed , i.e. , their inability to account for inhomogeneity even in heterogenous environments ( e.g. , membranes<symptom> or protein binding pockets). By using a first-order Laplace series expansion of the dielectric permittivity on the cutoff sphere , local anisotropic effects can be described in a simple form. It is shown that the resulting boundary-value problem can not be solved analytically , but instead a well-behaved approximative anisotropic reaction field ( ARF) is introduced , which preserves coordinate invariance and approaches the standard RF solution for homogeneous systems. The comparison of RF to the state-of-the-art particle-particle particle-mesh ( P
