 This study aimed to describe a seven hour End-of-Life/Palliative Care educational intervention including online content related to symptom<symptom> management , communication and decision-making capacity and an in-person group integration activity , from the perspective of the interprofessional team in terms of its acceptability and feasibility. A mixed-methods study design was used. The study was conducted in a medical-surgical Intensive Care Unit in Montreal , Canada. The sample consisted of 27 clinicians of the Intensive Care Unit interprofessional team who completed the End-of-Life/Palliative Care educational intervention , and participated in focus groups and completed a self-administered questionnaire. The main outcomes were the acceptability and feasibility of the educational intervention. The intervention was perceived to be appropriate and suitable in providing clinicians with knowledge and skills in symptom<symptom> management and communication through self-reflection and self-evaluation , provision of assessment tools and promotion of interprofessional teamwork. The online format was more feasible , but the in-person group activity was key for the integration of knowledge and the promotion of interprofessional discussions. Findings suggest that an interprofessional educational intervention integrating on-line content with in-person training has the potential to support clinicians in providing quality End-of-Life/Palliative Care in the Intensive Care Unit.
