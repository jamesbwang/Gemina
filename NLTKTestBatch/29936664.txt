 Progression of cardiac rehabilitation after cardiovascular surgery can be affected by frailty. The nutritional status<symptom> of the patient has been proposed as an indicator of frailty. In this study , we aimed to evaluate the influence of preoperative nutritional status<symptom> on the progress of postoperative cardiac rehabilitation. This study included 146 patients ( 82 males , 64 females , average age 71.9 Â± 12.0 years) who underwent elective cardiovascular surgery. In-hospital mortality cases were excluded to focus on postoperative cardiac rehabilitation. We classified patients with a Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index of 92 or higher as the good nutrition group and those with a Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index less than 92 as the malnutrition group. Preoperative patient characteristics and postoperative cardiac rehabilitation progress were compared between the good nutrition ( n = 93) and malnutrition ( n = 53) groups. The patients in the good nutrition group had an earlier progression to walking after postoperative rehabilitation ( p = 0.002) , a shorter postoperative hospital stay ( p = 0.004) , and a higher rate of discharge home ( p = 0.028) than those in the malnutrition group. Multivariable analysis demonstrated preoperative malnutrition to be an independent predictor for the day to 100 m walking ( p = 0.010). Preoperative nutritional status<symptom> was associated with progression of postoperative cardiac rehabilitation.
