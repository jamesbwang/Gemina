 Adiponectin is a peptide secreted by adipocytes , whose reduction is connected with obesity-related diseases<disease> , including insulin resistance. The study analyzed levels of total adiponectin and its high molecular weight<symptom> ( HMW) oligomer in a group of metabolically healthy adults and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) to evaluate these levels as potential predictors of the development of insulin resistance. Material and mehods: The study comprised 269 metabolically healthy adults and 300 patients with T2DM. Anthropometric and biochemical indices were measured , including total and HMW adiponectin levels , Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance ( HOMA-IR) index was calculated , logistic regression analysis with continuous predictors for insulin resistance prediction was used. In healthy individuals , both total and HMW adiponectin levels were significantly higher than in diabetic patients. Total and HMW adiponectin levels were adequately correlated with the HOMA-IR. Logistic regression analysis showed that increased levels of both total adiponectin ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.598 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.483-0.723) and the HMW form ( OR 0.360 , 95 % CI 0.242-0.511) are a protective factor for the development of insulin resistance. The cut-off levels were 4.22 mg/L for total adiponectin and 2.75 mg/L for HMW adiponectin. The results are valid for middle-aged European adults. Coclusions: Adiponectin levels below the indicated cut-offs may predict a potential risk for the development of insulin resistance.
