 Structure identification in non-targeted metabolomics based on liquid-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( LC-MS) remains a significant challenge. Quantitative structure-retention relationship ( QSRR) modeling is a technique capable of accelerating the structure identification of metabolites by predicting their retention<symptom> , allowing false positives to be eliminated during the interpretation of metabolomics data. In this work , 191 compounds were grouped according to molecular weight<symptom> and a QSRR study was carried out on the 34 resulting groups to eliminate false positives. Partial Least Squares ( PLS) regres-sion combined with a Genetic Algorithm ( GA) was applied to construct the linear QSRR models based on a variety of Vol-Surf + molecular descriptors. A novel dual-filtering approach , which combines Tanimoto Similarity ( TS) searching as the primary filter and retention<symptom> index ( RI) similarity clustering as the secondary filter , was utilized to select compounds in train-ing sets to derive the QSRR models with a yielded R2 of 0.8512 and an average root mean square error in prediction ( RMSEP) of 8.45 %. With a retention<symptom> index filter expressed as Â± 2 standard deviations ( SD) of the error , representative com-pounds were predicted with > 91 % accuracy , and for 53 % of the groups ( 18/34) at least one false positive compound could be eliminated. The proposed strategy can thus narrow down the number of false positives to be assessed in non-targeted metabolomics.
