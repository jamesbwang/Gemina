 The purpose of the current study was to investigate the mediatory role between vigorous physical activity , body mass index ( BMI) , and cardiorespiratory fitness on symptoms<symptom> of depression<symptom> and their subsequent direct and indirect effects on quality of life ( QoL). Five hundred and seventy-six adolescents ' ( 314 boys , 12.5 ± 1.1 years) physical activity levels , cardiorespiratory fitness , BMI , levels of depressive symptoms<symptom> , and QoL were measured. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the difference in linear structural associations between variables. The model suggested that cardiorespiratory fitness ( β = 0.16 , p < 0.001) and symptoms<symptom> of depression<symptom> ( β =- 0.52 , p < 0.001) were both directly associated with physical QoL , with depressive symptoms<symptom> also directly influencing psychological QoL ( β =- 0.79 , p < 0.01). Body mass index was indirectly associated with physical QoL , mediated by both symptoms<symptom> of depression<symptom> ( β =- 0.06 , p < 0.001) and cardiorespiratory fitness ( β = 0.05 , p < 0.001) and psychological QoL mediated by symptoms<symptom> of depression<symptom> ( β =- 0.09 , p < 0.001). Vigorous physical activity was indirectly associated with QoL , mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness ( β =- 0.04 , p < 0.001). Models suggested that vigorous physical activity , cardiorespiratory fitness and BMI were associated , both directly and indirectly , with mental well-being and QoL. It could , therefore , be postulated that enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness and BMI through increasing vigorous physical activity may be beneficial to both mental well-being and QoL in adolescents.
