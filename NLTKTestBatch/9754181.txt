 To investigate the mechanism of action and consistency in flow characteristics of the Ahmed glaucoma valve ( AGV) under simulated physiological conditions in-vitro and to evaluate whether resistance during priming has any effect on performance of the device. Each newly opened AGV device was connected to a digital manometer and was primed with normal saline. The device was then placed in a saline bath and connected to an open manometer , a digital manometer , and an infusion pump. Saline was infused at a rate of 3 μL/min for 24 hours. Digital manometer readings were recorded at 4 Hz. Data obtained from 9 devices are presented as medians ( ranges). The priming pressure was 1130 ( 835 , 1625) mm Hg. Pressure versus time curves showed two distinct phases; transient and steady phases. The transient phase peak pressure was 24 ( 13 , 45) mm Hg. In the steady phase , opening and closing pressures<symptom> were 13 ( 10 , 17) and 7 ( 4 , 9) mm Hg , respectively; the valve leaflets briefly opened every 73.9 ( 51 , 76.6) minutes and the fluctuation of pressure ( difference between opening and closing pressures<symptom>) was 6 ( 3 , 9) mm Hg. The Spearman correlation coefficient between priming and opening and priming and closing pressure was ρ = -0.13 ( The device showed functionality like a valve. The resistance during priming did not affect opening and closing pressures<symptom> of the AGV. This study showed variable in vitro performance of the AGV. These laboratory findings might , at least partly , explain the variability in the clinical outcome of the device.
