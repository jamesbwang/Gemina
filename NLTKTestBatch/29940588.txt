 To describe the study design and characteristics at first visit of participants in the longitudinal Scotopic Microperimetric Assessment of Rod Function in Stargardt Disease ( SMART) study. Scotopic microperimetry ( sMP) was performed in one designated study eye in a subset of participants with molecularly proven ABCA4-associated Stargardt disease<disease> ( STGD1) enrolled in a multicenter natural history study ( ProgStar). Study visits were every 6 months over a period ranging from 6 to 24 months , and also included fundus autofluorescence ( FAF). SMART enrolled 118 participants ( 118 eyes). At the first visit of SMART , the mean sensitivity in mesopic microperimetry was 11.48 ( ± 5.05; range 0.00-19.88) dB and in sMP 11.25 ( ± 5.26; 0-19.25) dB. For FAF , all eyes had a lesion<symptom> of decreased autofluorescence ( mean lesion<symptom> size 3.62 ( ± 3.48; 0.10-21.46) mm2) , and a total of 76 eyes ( 65.5 %) had a lesion<symptom> of definitely decreased autofluorescence with a mean lesion<symptom> size of 3.46 ( ± 3.60; 0.21-21.46) mm2. Rod function is impaired in STGD1 and can be assessed by sMP. Testing rod function may serve as a potential outcome measure for future clinical treatment trials. This is evaluated in the SMART study.
