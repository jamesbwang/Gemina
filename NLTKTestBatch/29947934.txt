 Abdominal and pelvic tumors in children and adolescents can be manifested intra-abdominally and also often in the retroperitoneum. The most important pediatric primary retroperitoneal space-occupying lesions<symptom> are nephroblastoma ( Wilms ' tumor) and neuroblastoma , whereby imaging plays a decisive role in the diagnostics and differentiation of the two entities. Benign tumors of the mesentery and gastrointestinal tract<symptom> occur more frequently in children than malignant lesions<symptom>. The benign entities include lipoma , polyps and vascular tumors , such as lymphatic malformations. Of the malignant sarcomas<disease> , abdominal rhabdomyosarcomas ( RMS) occur relatively often in childhood and adolescence. The most frequent pediatric abdominal lymphoma is Burkitt 's lymphoma , an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma. Relevant tumor entities in childhood are also germ cell tumors , which originate from the genitals ( gonadal) or can be extragonadally manifested. The benignancy or malignancy of germ cell tumors ranges from benign teratomas to highly malignant entities , such as yolk sac tumors. The germ cell tumors , just as all pediatric abdominal mass lesions<symptom> , show a broad spectrum of tumor aggressiveness , malignancy and therefore also prognosis and mortality for the affected children and adolescents.
