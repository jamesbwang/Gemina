 The inflammatory response plays a vital role in the development of in-stent restenosis ( ISR) after carotid angioplasty and stenting ( CAS). The neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( NLR) has been suggested as a sensitive inflammatory marker. We explored the association between NLR and ISR in CAS patients. A total of 427 patients who underwent CAS were enrolled. Neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio was measured before the procedure. Clinical examination and radiographic evaluation were performed at 6 months and annually after the procedure. In-stent restenosis was defined as ≥ 50 % stenosis in the treated lesion<symptom>. Cox regression was used to identify predictors of ISR after CAS. Of the 459 arteries ( in 427 patients) with CAS , 72 ( 15.7 %) were identified with ISR during a mean follow-up of 14.6 ( 19.1) months ( range , 0.7-120.7 months). Increased NLR ( ≥ 2.13) was significantly related to ISR in patients with asymptomatic stenosis ( P = .001). However , significance was not observed in symptomatic stenosis. On multivariate analysis , baseline NLR ≥ 2.13 ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 2.74; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.46-5.14) , smoking ( HR , 1.99; 95 % CI , 1.11-3.58) , residual stenosis ( HR , 1.12; 95 % CI , 1.09-1.15) , and baseline glucose level ( HR , 1.01; 95 % CI , 1.01-1.02) were associated with ISR. Elevated NLR may be a predictor of ISR after CAS for asymptomatic stenosis.
