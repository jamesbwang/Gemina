 The aim of this study was to investigate the role of disease<disease> conviction in the chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and life interference of patients with non-cardiac chest<symptom> pain<symptom> ( NCCP) , after controlling for anxiety<symptom> sensitivity and body vigilance. While all three psychological constructs are theoretically implicated and empirically associated with the experience of NCCP , no research has examined the influence of disease<disease> conviction in the context of other relevant constructs. The sample included 229 participants with NCCP who were recruited after a medical evaluation failed to elicit an organic explanation for their chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that while anxiety<symptom> sensitivity significantly predicted chest<symptom> pain<symptom> severity and interference , only body vigilance contributed significant additional variance to chest<symptom> pain<symptom> severity , and only disease<disease> conviction contributed significant additional variance to chest<symptom> pain<symptom> interference. While anxiety<symptom> sensitivity , body vigilance , and disease<disease> conviction all appear to affect those with NCCP , it seems that their impact is manifest in different domains ( i.e. , pain perception vs. psychosocial impairment).
