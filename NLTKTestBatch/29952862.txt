 Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) is an effective treatment in mania. However , there is little evidence regarding the use of ultrabrief right<symptom> unilateral ( RUL-UB) ECT in treatment of acute manic episodes. The aim of this study was to report on the effectiveness and cognitive profile of ECT in bipolar mania , including a sample who received RUL-UB ECT. This naturalistic study retrospectively collected data in 33 patients who received ECT with concurrent antipsychotics for mania between October 1 , 2014 , and July 30 , 2016. Electroconvulsive therapy was given using RUL-UB , brief-pulse right unilateral , or brief-pulse bitemporal approaches , dosed according to the patient 's seizure<symptom> threshold. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS) , Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS) score , and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA) were administered to patients before and after the ECT course. For the whole sample , there was a significant improvement in BPRS ( total score and manic subscale) , YMRS , and MoCA total scores across the ECT treatment course. The overall BPRS response rate was 84 % , and mean scores decreased from 42.1 ( SD , 12.0) to 26.0 ( SD , 4.0). The 13 patients who received RUL-UB ECT also showed significant improvement in BPRS , YMRS , and MoCA scores over the treatment course. Electroconvulsive therapy in general and also specifically RUL-UB ECT were effective in treating mania and also led to global cognitive improvement.
