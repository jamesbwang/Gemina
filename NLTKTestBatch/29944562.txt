 Auto-fluorescence ( AF) of healthy bone tissue has recently been described. Loss of AF ( LAF) has , on the contrary , been reported in necrotic bone. Further , the use of LAF as a possible guidance to distinguish viable from necrotic bone during surgical treatment of osteonecrosis has been proposed. The aim of this study is to detail 8 patients of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws treated through an AF-guided surgical resection. The authors also provide the histopathologic description of hypo-fluorescent and hyper-fluorescent bone in each patient. After removal of necrotic bone block , Er: YAG laser was used for vaporizing further necrotic bone , up to the detection of strongly hyper-fluorescent bone. Samples of hyper-fluorescent bone were collected around areas of necrosis<symptom>. Histopathologic evaluation revealed viable bone tissue in all hyper-fluorescent specimens. On the basis of these data , AF-guided surgical resection could be effective in highlighting surgical margins of necrotic bone tissue and it might have some utility in a range of applications of bone surgery.
