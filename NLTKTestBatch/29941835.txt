 The emerging mHealth applications , incorporating wearable sensors , enables continuous monitoring of physical activity ( PA). This study aimed at analyzing the relevance of a multivariate complexity metric in assessment of functional change in younger older adults. Thirty individuals ( 60 ‚Åª 70 years old) participated in a 4-week home-based exercise intervention. The Community Balance<symptom> and Mobility Scale ( CBMS) was used for clinical assessment of the participants & rsquo; functional balance<symptom> and mobility performance pre- and post- intervention. Accelerometers worn on the low<symptom> back were used to register PA of one week before and in the third week of the intervention. Changes in conventional univariate PA metrics ( percentage of walking and sedentary time , step counts , mean cadence) and complexity were compared to the change as measured by the CBMS. Statistical analyses ( 21 participants) showed significant rank correlation between the change as measured by complexity and CBMS ( & rho; = 0.47 ,
