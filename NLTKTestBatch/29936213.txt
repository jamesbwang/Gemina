 To report a single center experience with carotid body paraganglioma cases that were treated by the same surgeon in a city with high prevalence of paragangliomas due to high altitude. We retrospectively investigated the demographic , clinicopathological and radiological data of 104 patients diagnosed with cervical paragangliomas between 2003 and 2017. The patients were classified according to the Shamblin classification. In this study a total of 104 patients ( 33 male and 71 female , with a mean age of 54.6 ± 13 years) diagnosed with cervical paragangliomas located on carotid bifurcation between 2003 and 2017 were included. Among those patients , 10 presented with bilateral tumors and in total , 114 paragangliomas were managed in this period. The mean diameter of the tumors was 5.12 ± 1.45 cm. Malignant tumor was determined in only one ( 0.9 %) patient. All patients were operated. In 12 patients with the tumor diameter larger than 5 cm , preoperative coil embolization was achieved. In 14 patients , preoperative angiographic embolization was employed and in 4 patients intraoperative sclerosing agent injections were performed. Facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> was observed in 2 patients and dysphagia<symptom> was present in 1 patient , Horner syndrome<symptom> was seen in 1 patient and hoarseness<symptom> was reported in 7 patients after operation. All those complications improved during follow-up. Mortality was not reported in any cases. Surgery is the definitive treatment for patients with cervical paragangliomas. Although , it may be difficult in patients with the advanced Shamblin types , in experienced hands , complication rates are very low.
