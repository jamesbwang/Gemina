 Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. There are numerous potential causes , with food allergy being the leading cause in children and the focus of this review. Most reactions involve an IgE-mediated mechanism , although non-IgE-mediated and nonimmunologic reactions can occur. Various cofactors to be discussed can place certain individuals at an increased risk of severe or fatal anaphylaxis. The clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis are broad and may involve multiple body systems. Diagnosis of food-related anaphylaxis is primarily based on signs and symptoms<symptom> and supported , wherever possible , by identification and confirmation of a culprit food allergen. First-line treatment of anaphylaxis is intramuscular administration of epinephrine. Long-term management is generally focused on strict allergen avoidance and more recently on food desensitization using immunotherapy. This review provides an overview of anaphylaxis with a specific focus on food allergy.
