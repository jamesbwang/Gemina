 Adequate tissue removal must be performed for symptom<symptom> relief following reduction mammoplasty. However , this is not always possible in patients with gigantomastia because the pedicle is planned wider and the breast can not be sufficiently reduced to prevent compromising the blood supply to the pedicle. To maximize blood circulation to the nipple-areola complex in our patients , the pedicle was planned to include the internal thoracic artery branches coming from both the second and third interspaces and the intercostal artery branches coming from the fourth and fifth intercostal spaces. A total of 185 patients underwent reduction mammoplasty with the superomedial pedicle- and septal perforator-based technique. The mean weight<symptom> of excised tissue was 928.77 g from the right breast and 899.92 g from the left , whereas the mean distance of nipple-areola transfer was 11.52 cm on the right breast and 11.27 cm on the left. Complications developed in 11 patients ( 5.94 %): hematoma occurred in three patients , partial<symptom> loss<symptom> of areola and fat necrosis<symptom> in five patients , and wound<disease> dehiscence in three patients. The pedicle included vessels of both superomedial and septum origin without any disruption in circulation. Consequently , the blood supply of the nipple-areola complex was preserved. Furthermore , in cases where the pedicle was long , intercostal perforators were identified and the pedicle was narrowed thoroughly; thus , the breast was reduced to the desired volume while minimizing the risk of complications.
