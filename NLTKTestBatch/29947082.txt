 The enantioseparation of twelve pairs of structurally related 1-aryl-1-indanone derivatives was studied in the normal phase mode using three different polysaccharide type chiral stationary phases , namely Chiralpak IB , Chiralpak IC and Chiralpak ID. n-hexane/2-propanol and n-hexane/ethanol were employed as mobile phases. Among all the investigated chiral columns , Chiralpak IC exhibited the most universal and best enantioseparation ability toward all the racemates , particularly with the mobile phase composed of n-hexane/2-propanol ( 90/10 , v/v). Then the effects of column temperature on retention<symptom> and enantioselectivity were examined in the range of 25-40 °C. Satisfactory enantioseparation was obtained at ambient temperature. The natural logarithm of retention<symptom> and separation factors ( ln k and ln α) versus the reciprocal of absolute temperature ( 1/T) ( Va n't Hoff plots) were found to be linear for all racemates , indicating that the retention<symptom> and separation mechanisms were independent of temperature in the range investigated. Then , the thermodynamic parameters ( ΔΔH ° , ΔΔS ° and ΔΔG °) were calculated from Va n't Hoff plots. These values indicated that the solute transfer from the mobile to stationary phase was enthalpically favorable , and the process of enantioseparation was mainly enthalpy controlled. At last , the impact of small changes in molecular structures of the tested 1-indanone derivatives on enantioseparation was also discussed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
