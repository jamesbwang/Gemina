 Aberrant protein expression within the hippocampus has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced memory<symptom> impairment<symptom>. The objective of the current study was to search for specific memory-related factors in the hippocampus in obese rats. Sprague-Dawley ( SD) rats were fed either a high-fat ( HF) diet or normal-fat ( NF) diet for 10 weeks to obtain the control ( CON) , diet-induced obese rats ( DIO) and diet-resistant ( DR) rats. D-galactose was injected subcutaneously for 10 weeks to establish model ( MOD) rats with learning and memory<symptom> impairment<symptom>. After the hippocampus of the rats sampling , the proteome analysis was conducted using two-dimensional get electrophoresis ( 2-DE) combined with peptide mass fingerprinting ( PMF). We found 15 differential proteins that expressed in the hippocampus in rats induced by HF diet from the 2-DE map. In addition , Neurocalcin-delta ( NCALD) was nearly down-regulated in the DR rats compared with CON rats and MOD rats , which was further confirmed by Western blot , real-time PCR and ELISA results. Our data demonstrates that the differential memory-related proteins were a reflection of the HF diet , but not potential factors in obesity proneness or obesity resistance. Furthermore , NCALD is proved to be a potential hippocampus-memory related factor related to obesity.
