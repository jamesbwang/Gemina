 To compare the clinical features of seminal vesicle calculi ( SVC) versus posterior urethral haemangioma ( PUH) to assist urologists in differentiating and diagnosing the causes of haematospermia. Patients with SVC or PUH were included. Patient age , disease<disease> duration , hospital stay , operation time , symptoms<symptom> , surgical approach , pathological results and postoperative complications were recorded. A total of seven patients with SVC and 15 patients with PUH involved have an average age of 34.1 and 44.5 years separately. Patients with SVC complained of recurrent haematospermia; patients with PUH complained of recurrent haematospermia and urethral opening bleeding after sexual arousal. SVC manifested as a dark red blood-semen mixture with ejaculation pain and no blood clots; the condition could improve after anti-infective treatment. PUH manifested as no visible blood-semen mixture , bright red semen with blood clots and no ejaculation pain; the condition did not respond to anti-infective treatment. SVC was treated with holmium laser lithotripsy under a transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy. PUH was treated with transurethral resection and fulguration. Postoperative follow-up showed that the clinical symptoms<symptom> gradually disappeared , with no postoperative complications. Both SVC and PUH can result in recurrent haematospermia. Therefore , urologists should treat haematospermia differently according to the cause.
