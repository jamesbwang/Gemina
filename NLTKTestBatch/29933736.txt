 Carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> is a bacterium<pathogen> that causes various hospital acquired infections , primarily ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease><symptom> and bloodstream infections. The multidrug resistance problem of the bacteria<pathogen> all over the world , is also a problem in our center. As the treatment options are decreasing combination therapies become a current issue. It is believed that in vitro synergy tests may guide to the selection of antibiotic combinations. The aim of this study was to present the antibiotic combinations used in the treatment of carbapenem resistant A.baumannii infections and the synergy test results of these combinations. A total of 71 carbapenem-resistant A.baumannii isolates from various clinical samples of patients in Hacettepe University Adult and Oncology Hospitals was included in the study. All isolates were from nosocomial infections that were being requested for synergy testing by the consulting physicians in the Department of Infectious<disease> Diseases<disease> and Clinical Microbiology between January 2002 and December 2016. Only one isolate from one patient was included in the analysis. The synergy test for these isolates was performed by E-test method. Of the total , 41 ( 58 %) isolates were from various clinical samples of patients in intensive care units and 30 ( 42 %) were from patients in different wards. Twenty-three of the isolates were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) fluid , 18 from pus , 14 from deep tracheal aspirate , 6 from central venous catheter , 5 from blood and 5 from other various samples. The fractional inhibition concentration ( FIC) index for each combination was calculated and the results were interpreted as synergistic , additive , indifferent and antagonist. A total of 38 different combinations of antibiotics were tested. According to the frequency of synergistic activity , the combinations were; meropenem-colistin ( 11/12) , meropenem-amikacin ( 7/9) , meropenem-tobramycin ( 9/13) , rifampicin-colistin ( 7/11) , cefaperazone-sulbactam-tobramycin ( 8/16) and sefaperazon-sulbactam-amikacin ( 5/10). The most common antagonistic combinations were tigecyclin-colistin ( 2/6) , meropenem-tobramycin ( 3/13) , cefepim-tobramycin ( 4/19) , rifampicin-colistin ( 2/11) combinations. In our center , different combinations of antibiotics are being used for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant A.baumannii due to the changing and increasing antibiotic resistance of the bacteria<pathogen> over the years. Sensitivity tests as well as synergy tests are used when selecting different combinations of antibiotics. However generalizability of the synergistic effect of combinations is limited. It is important to repeat these studies at regular intervals. In addition there is also a need for further studies to evaluate the correlation between in vitro laboratory results and in vivo clinical compliance.
