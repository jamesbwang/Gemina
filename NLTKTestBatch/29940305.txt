 Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) with multipoint left ventricular ( LV) pacing ( MultiPoint Pacing ( MPP)) improves acute hemodynamics and chronic outcomes in comparison to conventional biventricular pacing ( BiV) , though MPP programming questions persist. In this multicenter feasibility study , we evaluated the feasibility of using noninvasive systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) to guide MPP programming and assessed the chronic 6-month echocardiographic CRT response. Patients implanted with MPP-enabled CRT-defibrillator devices underwent noninvasive hemodynamic assessment ( finger arterial pressure) during a pacing protocol that included atrial-only pacing and various BiV and MPP configurations. Each configuration was repeated 4 times , alternating with reference , to calculate the SBP difference relative to reference ( ΔSBP). CRT configurations with the greatest ΔSBP were programmed. An independent core laboratory analyzed baseline and 6-month echocardiograms , with CRT response defined as a 6-month reduction in LV end-systolic volume ≥ 15 %. Forty-two patients ( 71 % male; LV ejection fraction 30.3 % ± 7.5 %; QRS duration 161 ± 19 ms; 26 % had ischemic cardiomyopathy) were enrolled in 4 European centers. Relative to atrial-only pacing , the best BiV and best MPP configurations produced significant SBP elevations of 3.1 ± 4.2 ( P < .01) and 4.1 ± 4.1 mm Hg ( P < .01) , respectively ( BiV vs MPP; P < .01). Greater SBP elevations were associated with the best MPP compared with the best BiV configurations in 29 of 37 patients completing the pacing protocol ( 78 %). Of MPP-programmed patients completing the 6-month follow-up visit , 23 of 27 ( 85 %) were classified as CRT responders ( 6-month reduction in LV end-systolic volume 31 % ± 20 %). Acute noninvasive hemodynamics after CRT device implantation predominantly favored MPP over BiV programming. MPP programming guided by noninvasive hemodynamics resulted in positive LV structural remodeling.
