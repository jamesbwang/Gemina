 HIV<pathogen> resistance emerging against antiretroviral drugs represents a great threat to the continued prolongation of HIV-infected patients ' lifespans. Methods capable of predicting resistance susceptibility in the development of compounds are therefore in great need. Targeting the major reverse transcription residues Y181 , K103 and L100 , we used the biologi-cal activities of compounds against these enzymes and the wild type reverse transcriptase to create Na√Øve Bayes Net-works. Through this machine learning approach , we could predict with high accuracy whether a compound would be susceptible to loss<symptom> of potency due to resistance. Also , we could perfectly predict retrospectively whether compounds would be susceptible to both a K103 mutant RT and a Y181 mutant RT.. In the study presented here our method outper-formed a traditional molecular mechanics approach. This method should be of broad interest beyond drug discovery efforts , and serves to expand the utility of machine learning for the prediction of physical , chemical or biological prop-erties using the vast information available in the literature.
