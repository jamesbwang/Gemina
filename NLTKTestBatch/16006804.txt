 Barrett 's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia and early-stage adenocarcinoma is amenable to curative treatment by endoscopic resection. Histopathological correlation has established that mucosal cancer has minimal risk of nodal metastases and that long-term complete remission can be achieved. Although surgery is the gold-standard treatment once there is submucosal involvement , even T1sm1 ( submucosal invasion ≤ 500 μm) cases without additional risk factors for nodal metastases might also be cured with endoscopic resection. Endoscopic resection is foremost an initial diagnostic procedure , and once histopathological assessment confirms that curative criteria are met , it will be considered curative. Endoscopic resection may be achieved by endoscopic mucosal resection , which , although easy to perform with relatively low risk , is limited by an inability to achieve en bloc resection for lesions<symptom> of size more than 1.5 cm. Conversely , the technique of endoscopic submucosal dissection is more technically demanding with higher risk of complications but is able to achieve en bloc resection for lesions<symptom> larger than 1.5 cm. Endoscopic submucosal dissection would be particularly important in specific situations such as suspected submucosal invasion and lesion<symptom> size more than 1.5 cm. In other situations , since endoscopic resection would always be combined with radiofrequency ablation to ablate the remaining Barrett 's epithelium , piecemeal endoscopic mucosal resection would suffice since any remnant superficial invisible dysplasia would be ablated.
