 Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-poly-l-lysine carboxymethylcellulose ( Poly-ICLC) , a synthetic double-stranded RNA complex , is a ligand for toll-like receptor-3 ( TLR3) and MDA-5 that can activate immune cells such as dendritic cells and trigger NK cells to kill tumor cells. In this pilot study , eligible patients included those with recurrent metastatic disease<disease> who failed prior systemic therapy ( head<disease> and neck squamous cell cancer ( HNSCC) , melanoma). Patients received 2 treatment cycles , each cycle consisting of 1 mg Poly-ICLC 3x weekly intratumorally ( IT) for 2 weeks followed by intramuscular ( IM) boosters biweekly for 7 weeks with a 1-week rest period. Immune response was evaluated by immunohistochemistry ( IHC) and RNA Sequencing ( RNASeq) in tumor and blood. Two patients completed 2 cycles of IT treatments and one achieved clinical benefit ( stable disease<disease> , PFS 6 months) , while the remainder had progressive disease<disease>. Poly-ICLC was well tolerated with principal side effects of fatigue<symptom> and inflammation at injection site ( < grade 2). In the patient with clinical benefit , IHC analysis of tumor showed increased CD4 , CD8 , PD1 and PDL1 levels compared to patients with progressive disease<disease>. RNASeq analysis of the same patient 's tumor and PBMC showed dramatic changes in response to Poly-ICLC treatment including upregulation of genes associated with chemokine activity , T cell activation and antigen presentation. Poly-ICLC was well tolerated in solid cancer patients , and generated local and systemic immune responses as evident in the patient achieving clinical benefit. These results warrant further investigation , and are currently being explored in a multicenter phase II clinical trial ( NCT02423863).
