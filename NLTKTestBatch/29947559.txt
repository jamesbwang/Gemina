 The purpose of this study was to test the reliability and validity of the Checklist for Function-Focused Care in Service Plans. Function-focused care is a care approach that optimizes function and physical activity during all care interactions. This study used baseline data from the first cohort of the study titled Dissemination and Implementation of Function-Focused Care for Assisted Living Using the Evidence Integration Triangle ( FFC-AL-EIT). A total of 242 participants were recruited from 26 assisted living facilities. The majority of participants were White<symptom> , female , and unmarried. There was support for internal consistency with an alpha coefficient of .96 , interrater reliability with a correlation of .80 , construct validity based on Rasch analysis and INFIT statistics ranging from 0.69 to 1.29 , and a significant association with function-focused care activities. Although there is some support for reliability and validity of the measure , modifications are recommended to add more challenging items.
