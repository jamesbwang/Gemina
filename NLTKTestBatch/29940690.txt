 Bacterial infections in the form of adherent biofilms are frequently implicated in the pathogenesis and recalcitrance of chronic rhinosinusitis. The Hydrodebrider , a disposable powered irrigation and suction device , has been developed specifically to remove biofilm from the paranasal sinuses. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the Hydrodebrider in the office setting with the use of local anesthesia. Of the original 13 adults we recruited , 10 completed the entire study protocol. All enrolled patients had previously undergone sinus surgery that involved the creation of a maxillary antrostomy large enough to allow placement of a Hydrodebrider device , and the endoscopic findings in all patients were consistent with chronic sinusitis<disease>. The standard visual analog scale for pain ( range: 0 to 10) was used to measure tolerability. The 20-Item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-20) for symptoms<symptom> was completed at baseline and at 1 and 8 weeks after the procedure. The mean pain score obtained immediately after the procedure was only 2.3 , indicating that the procedure was well tolerated. The mean SNOT-20 score trended toward improvement during the first week , but then returned to near-preprocedure levels at 8 weeks. In conclusion , powered irrigation with suction is a well-tolerated procedure in the office setting and might be a useful short-term adjunct in the management of recalcitrant chronic sinusitis<disease>.
