 This review paper gives an overview of the management of somatic symptom<symptom> disorder. It starts with a description of the clinical problem of patients with persistent bodily distress , discusses classificatory , epidemiological , and etiological issues and then describes the evidence and practical principles of dealing with these patients who are often seen as `` difficult '' to treat. It is concluded that the best-suited approach is stepped care with close cooperation of primary care , a somatic specialist , and mental health care professionals operating on the basis of a biopsychosocial model of integrating somatic as well as psychosocial determinants of distress and therapeutic factors.
