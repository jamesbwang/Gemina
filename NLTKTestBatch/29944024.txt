 Utilizing advances in genetic and immunologic analysis to segment and direct treatment is potentially a way of maintaining therapeutic progress toward cure in multiple myeloma ( MM). This approach works well using clinical segments but can be optimized using recent genetic and immunologic technologies , which have opened the possibility of enhancing risk stratification and disease<disease> subclassification. Areas covered: This position paper discusses strategies to segment myeloma into subgroups with distinct risk profiles and distinct targetable lesions<symptom> are presented. Expert commentary: Risk stratified treatment of MM is already a clinical reality that can be enhanced by the developmental of unified segmentation and testing approaches. Mutation-targeted treatment has proven to be effective against the RAS pathway , but is compromised by intra-clonal and spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Identifying new disease<disease> segments based on tumor biology or immunological content of the microenvironment offers an exciting new way to control and even eradicate myeloma clones. Going forward , risk and biologically stratified therapy for myeloma is a promising way of maintaining therapeutic progress , as is precision immunotherapy directed by the cellular context of the bone<disease> marrow.
