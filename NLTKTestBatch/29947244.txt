 During the development of a citrus fruit , many cycles of infection<disease> of Xanthomonas<pathogen> citri subsp. citri may occur leading to the development of a range of characteristics of citrus canker lesions<symptom> scattered across the fruit surface. This study aimed to determine whether the size of the lesions<symptom> , their distance from the peduncle , and the number and time of appearance of the lesions<symptom> on fruit of sweet orange were associated with premature fruit drop. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed a negative relationship between the fruit detachment force and the lesion<symptom> diameter , the proximity of the nearest lesion<symptom> to the peduncle and the number of lesions<symptom>. A survival analysis demonstrated that these characteristics significantly influenced the probability and the time that a cankered fruit remained attached to the tree. More than 90 % of dropped fruit had large lesions<symptom> ( > 5 mm) but not all fruit with large lesions<symptom> dropped before harvest. Approximately 50 % of the harvested fruit had lesions<symptom> > 5 mm. On the harvested fruit remaining on the tree , although large , the lesions<symptom> had a smaller diameter , were located farther from the peduncle , and were less numerous than those observed on dropped fruit. Small canker lesions<symptom> neither reduced the detachment force nor the survival of fruit in the tree. The earlier a fruit expressed canker symptoms<symptom> , the higher the probability the fruit developed large lesions<symptom> near the peduncle and/or developed lesions<symptom> in greater numbers. This study provides a better understanding on the relationship between the time of appearance of lesions<symptom> of citrus canker on fruit and premature fruit drop. This information defines the critical period for fruit protection and may be used to improve disease<disease> management.
