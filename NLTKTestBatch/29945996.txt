 Unmutated ( UM) immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region ( IgHV) status<symptom> or IgHV3-21 gene usage is associated with poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) patients. Interestingly , IgHV3-21 is often co-expressed with light chain IgLV3-21 , which is potentially able to trigger cell-autonomous BCR-mediated signaling. However , this light chain has never been characterized independently of the heavy chain IgHV3-21. We performed total RNA sequencing in 32 patients and investigated IgLV3-21 prognostic impact in terms of treatment-free ( TFS) and overall ( OS) survival in 3 other independent cohorts for a total of 813 patients. IgLV3-21 presence was tested by real-time PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Using total RNA sequencing to characterize 32 patients with high-risk CLL , we found a high frequency ( 28 %) of IgLV3-21 rearrangements. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that these patients express higher levels of genes responsible for ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation ( P < 0.0001) as well as MYC target genes ( P = 0.0003). Patients with IgLV3-21 rearrangements displayed a significantly shorter TFS and OS ( P < 0.05) , particularly in IgHV-mutated patients. In each of the 3 independent validation cohorts , we showed that IgLV3-21 rearrangements- similar to UM IgHV status<symptom>- conferred poor prognosis compared to mutated IgHV ( P < 0.0001). Importantly , we confirmed by multivariate analysis that this was independent of IgHV mutational status<symptom> or subset # 2 stereotyped receptor ( P < 0.0001). We have demonstrated for the first time that a light chain can impact CLL prognosis and that IgLV3-21 light chain usage defines a new subgroup of CLL patients with poor prognosis.
