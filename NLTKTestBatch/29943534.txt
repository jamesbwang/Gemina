 Recombinant PRRSV △ 2ORF5 gene was constructed using DNA shuffling from four genetically different strains of PRRSV to study its heterologous cross-neutralizing ability. The △ 2ORF5 mutant gene was cloned into the vector pET-32a and transferred into E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> BL21. SDS-PAGE confirmed that the molecular weight<symptom> of the recombinant △ 2ORF5 was about 42 kDa , consistent with the predicted result. Then the purified recombinant protein was injected into BALB/c mouse to obtain polyclonal antibody. Western blotting analysis with mouse-anti- △ 2ORF5 polyclonal serum indicated that the parental virus<pathogen> recombinant GP5 protein reacted with the specific antibodies. Four parental viruses<pathogen> could be inhibited by the anti- △ 2ORF5 polyclonal antibody and the inhibition rates were higher than 53 %. This work has laid a foundation for further development vaccine for PRRSV.
