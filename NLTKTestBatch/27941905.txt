 The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship among the number of negative lymph nodes ( LNs) , the local and systemic immune response , and survival in patients with colon cancer. One thousand one hundred and fifty-seven patients with colon cancer who underwent surgery at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between 2009 and 2014 were included. We examined negative LNs in relation to the local and systemic immune response , including percentage carcinoma , neutrophil and lymphocyte<symptom> infiltration , Crohn 's- like reaction , neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio , platelets , and C-reactive protein ( CRP). Disease-free survival and overall survival were also examined. We performed subgroup analysis based on the distribution of negative LNs. An increased number of negative LNs was associated with greater neutrophil invasion ( Our study suggests that negative LNs are indicators of the immune response and are associated with a better prognosis in patients with colon cancer.
