 Ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( VT) is a leading cause of cardiovascular death and remains the main cause of sudden cardiac death. Implanted cardiac defibrillators ( ICD) improve survival but the recurrent ICD therapies , mostly ICD shocks<disease> , are associated with an increased mortality and deleterious psychological effects. In this regard and based on the results of multicenter studies , the current European guidelines recommend early referral for catheter ablation. The ablation strategy ( isolated endocardial approach or combined epi-/ endocardial) depends mostly on the underlying myocardial disease<disease>. Thus , almost all patients with right ventricular dysplasia and Chagas disease<disease> , the majority of those with dilative cardiomyopathy , and some patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy ( mostly posterior wall infarction or large transmural anterior wall infarction) have an epicardial scar as the underlying substrate for recurrent VT episodes. Thus , in this group of patients , isolated endocardial VT ablation may be associated with an increased VT recurrence and therefore an epicardial approach is also needed. Cardiac imaging ( cardio-CT/MRI with late enhancement ( MRI LE)) can reliably identify the distribution and characteristics of the myocardial scar and may be helpful in planning the ablation strategy. When performed in highly specialized centers , epicardial catheter ablation of VT leads to a significant reduction of recurrent VT episodes compared to the endocardial VT ablation alone and with lower complication rates.
