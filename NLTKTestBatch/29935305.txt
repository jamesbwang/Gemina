 Checkpoint inhibitors augment the immune system 's natural surveillance mechanisms and have increasing applications in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Immunosuppressive corticosteroids are also frequently used in this population to treat unwanted inflammation<symptom>. Based on this mechanistic opposition , we investigated the interaction between nivolumab and corticosteroids in patients with advanced NSCLC. A retrospective chart review of 210 NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab at the Cleveland Clinic was performed. Use of systemic corticosteroids ( equivalent to > 10 mg prednisone per day) during nivolumab therapy was associated with objective outcomes of number of nivolumab cycles and overall survival. Sixty-six patients ( 31 %) received concurrent systemic corticosteroids during nivolumab therapy. The most common indications included sequelae from active or treated brain metastases ( 27 %) and COPD or other respiratory<disease> disease<disease> ( 21 %). For patients with early exposure to steroids within the first 30 days of nivolumab therapy ( 12 % , n = 25) , the median number of nivolumab cycles was two , compared to five cycles in patients not exposed to corticosteroids ( p = 0.002). Median overall survival for patients on steroids during the first 30 days was 4.3 months , compared to 11 months for patients not on steroids , hazard ratio for death 2.30 ( 95 % CI 1.27-4.16 , p = 0.006) in multivariate analysis. Nearly one-third of NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab were prescribed concurrent corticosteroids during the course of nivolumab therapy. Patients exposed to corticosteroids during the first cycle of nivolumab received fewer total cycles of nivolumab , suggesting decreased clinical benefit , and had shorter overall survival.
