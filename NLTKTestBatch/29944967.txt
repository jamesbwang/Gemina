 To examine factors that affect cost-related medication non-adherence ( CRN) , defined as taking medication less than as prescribed because of cost , among adults with diabetes and to determine their relative contribution in explaining CRN. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data for 2013-2014 were used to identify individuals with diabetes and their CRN. We modeled CRN as a function of financial factors , regimen complexity , and other contextual factors including diabetes care , lifestyle , and health factors. Dominance analysis was performed to rank these factors by relative importance. CRN among U.S. adults with diabetes was 16.5 %. Respondents with annual income < $ 50,000 and without health insurance were more likely to report CRN , compared to those with income ≥ $ 50,000 and those with insurance , respectively. Insulin users had 1.24 times higher risk of CRN compared to those not on insulin. Contextual factors that significantly affected CRN included diabetes care factors , lifestyle factors , and comorbid depression<symptom> , arthritis<disease> , and COPD/asthma. Dominance analysis showed health insurance was the most important factor for respondents < 65 and depression<symptom> was the most important factor for respondents ≥ 65. In addition to traditional risk factors of CRN , compliance with annual recommendations for diabetes and healthy lifestyle were associated with lower CRN. Policies and social supports that address these contextual factors may help improve CRN.
