 A recent meta-analysis identified a prospective association between depression<symptom> and cardiovascular disease<disease>; however , there was no association for studies with long-term follow-up periods. The literature has primarily focused on baseline depression<symptom> status<symptom> or symptoms<symptom> , which may not capture the chronic nature of depression<symptom>. This study examined the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms<symptom> and cardiovascular disease<disease> up to 15 years later in 274 cardiovascular disease-free older adults. Depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , mean arterial pressure , and cardiovascular disease<disease> status<symptom> were assessed. Baseline and chronic depressive symptoms<symptom> predicted increased risk of cardiovascular disease<disease> , underscoring the importance of assessing and treating depression<symptom> in older adults.
