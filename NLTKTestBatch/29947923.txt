 Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy that has substantial short- and long-term adverse health implications for women and their children. However , large-scale studies on genetic risk loci for GDM remain sparse. We conducted a case-control study among 2636 women with GDM and 6086 non-GDM control women from the Nurses ' Health Study II and the Danish National Birth Cohort. A total of 112 susceptibility genetic variants confirmed by genome-wide association studies for type 2 diabetes were selected and measured. A weighted genetic risk score ( GRS) was created based on variants that were significantly associated with risk of GDM after correcting for the false discovery rate. For the first time , we identified eight variants associated with GDM , namely rs7957197 ( HNF1A) , rs10814916 ( GLIS3) , rs3802177 ( SLC30A8) , rs9379084 ( RREB1) , rs34872471 ( TCF7L2) , rs7903146 ( TCF7L2) , rs11787792 ( GPSM1) and rs7041847 ( GLIS3). In addition , we confirmed three variants , rs10830963 ( MTNR1B) , rs1387153 ( MTNR1B) and rs4506565 ( TCF7L2) , that had previously been significantly associated with GDM risk. Furthermore , compared with participants in the first ( lowest) quartile of weighted GRS based on these 11 SNPs , the ORs for GDM were 1.07 ( 95 % CI 0.93 , 1.22) , 1.23 ( 95 % CI 1.07 , 1.41) and 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.34 , 1.74) for participants in the second , third and fourth ( highest) quartiles , respectively. The significant positive associations between the weighted GRS and risk of GDM persisted across most of the strata of major risk factors for GDM , including family history of type 2 diabetes , smoking status<symptom> , BMI and age. In this large-scale case-control study with women from two independent populations , eight novel GDM SNPs were identified. These findings offer the potential to improve our understanding of the aetiology of GDM , and particularly of biological mechanisms related to beta cell function.
