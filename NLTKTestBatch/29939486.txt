 Cyanobacteriochromes ( CBCRs) are photoreceptors in cyanobacteria<pathogen> that present a bilin chromophore-binding GAF domain as a photochromic element to control the activity of a downstream enzyme or regulator. CBCR Slr1393 from Synechocystis PCC 6803 carries three GAF domains , but only the third one binds covalently phycocyanobilin. Slr1393 shows photochromicity between a red- and a green absorbing state and regulates a C-terminally located histidine kinase. In this work , we fused this third GAF domain to an adenylyl cyclase ( AC) from Microcoleus chthonoplastes PCC7420 that in its genuine form is under blue light control from a LOV domain. A series of RGS-AC variants were constructed with various length of linkers between RGS and AC. Assays in vitro and in living Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom> cells ( AC-deletion mutant) demonstrate that the activity of AC is light-regulated , namely the red light converted form of RGS ∆ 14- ∆ 4AC ( in vitro) was about three-fold more active than the green light converted form. Expression of the fusion protein RGS ∆ 14- ∆ 4AC in vivo again showed highest light regulation with an at least three fold amplification of the AC function. In some experiments yielded even ten-fold higher activity indicating that the protein when expressed under in vivo conditions is part of the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen><symptom> physiological conditions and thereby subject to more complex and variable regulation through other E. coli-inherent factors.
