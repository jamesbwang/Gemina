 Medium-vessel hemorrhage<symptom> is a rare occurrence in ANCA-associated vasculitis , and has been previously described in only a few patients with microscopic polyangiitis. We report a case of renal<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom> in a patient with microscopic polyangiitis that was successfully managed by transcatheter arterial embolization of the active bleeding sites. The early clinical findings included necrotizing arteritis , as indicated by skin biopsy; rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis<disease>; mononeuritis multiplex; positive screening for myeloperoxidase-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Corticosteroid therapy was initiated. The patient 's health deteriorated at 1 week , with rapidly progressing anemia<symptom>. Computerized tomography identified a large , right-sided , perirenal hematoma , with active bleeding. Bleeding was successfully managed via segmental embolization of the renal artery. The patient was treated with steroid therapy and MZR , and subsequently underwent maintenance hemodialysis treatment for end-stage renal disease<disease>. Spontaneous renal<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom> is a rare but fatal clinical condition. A ruptured renal artery should be considered in a patient with microscopic polyangiitis , even in the absence of previous trauma and renal biopsy , when unexplained anemia<symptom> or signs of shock<symptom> occur.
