 The focus of this study was the ability of adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome<symptom> to infer meaning from facial expressions in the absence of emotion labels and use this inference in order to adjust their behavior. Participants with Down syndrome<symptom> ( N = 19 , mean nonverbal mental age of 5.8 years) and 4- to 7-year-old typically developing children performed a novel task in which happy and angry faces were provided as feedback for a choice made by the participants. In making a subsequent choice , the participants with Down syndrome<symptom> performed similarly to the 4 year olds , indicating a difficulty using angry faces as feedback. Individual differences within the group were also apparent. Implications for the development of social competence are discussed.
