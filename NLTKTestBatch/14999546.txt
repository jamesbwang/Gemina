 Adrenal hemorrhage<symptom> represents a relatively rare condition , usually associated with meningococcal septicemia<disease><symptom>. It is an underestimated cause of acute decompensation , multiorgan failure and death , usually diagnosed post-mortem. Depending on its etiology adrenal hemorrhage<symptom> is categorized as traumatic and non-traumatic. The technical advancement of imaging modalities , has made diagnosis and management more efficient. Assessment of hemodynamic stability , exclusion of a hormonal active adrenal tumor and assessment for adrenal insuffi Â¬ ciency , are of cardinal importance. Angiographic embolization has contributed significantly in better outcomes as emergency laparotomy is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Hereby we present two cases of spontaneous adrenal hemorrhage<symptom> associated with extensive retroperitoneal bleeding and hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom>. Both underwent angiography with one requiring embolization with favorable outcome. Investigation for exclusion of underlying adrenal tumor , adrenal insufficiency and follow-up imaging are presented in detail for both cases.
