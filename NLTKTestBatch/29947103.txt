 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease<disease> ( NAFLD) is a highly prevalent condition which contributes to atherogenic apolipoprotein B dyslipiproteinemias. Lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase ( LCAT) and phospholipid transfer protein ( PLTP) are both synthesized by the liver , and are important in lipid metabolism. Here we interrogated the impact of NAFLD on plasma LCAT and PLTP activities. Plasma LCAT activity ( exogenous substrate assay) and PLTP activity ( phospholipid vesicles-HDL assay) were determined in 348 subjects ( 279 men; 81 subjects with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM); 123 with metabolic syndrome<symptom> ( MetS)). A Fatty Liver index ( FLI) ≥ 60 was used as a proxy of NAFLD. Insulin resistance was determined by homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA-IR). 147 participants had an FLI ≥ 60 coinciding with T2DM and MetS ( P < 0.001 for each). Plasma LCAT and PLTP activity were on average 12 % and 5 % higher , respectively , in subjects with an FLI ≥ 60 ( P < 0.001 for each). In age- and sex-adjusted partial linear regression analysis , LCAT and PLTP activity were positively related to various obesity measures and HOMA-IR ( P < 0.001 for each). In multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for age and sex , LCAT activity was associated with an FLI ≥ 60 independent of T2DM and MetS , the waist/hip ratio , or HOMA-IR ( β = 0.307 to 0.366 , P < 0001 for all models). PLTP activity was also associated with an FLI ≥ 60 independent of these variables ( β = 0.151 to 0223 , P = 0.013 to 0.001). NAFLD , as inferred from an FLI ≥ 60 , confers higher plasma LCAT and to a lesser extent PLTP activity , even when taking account of T2DM , MetS , central obesity and insulin resistance.
