 Discovering materials that exhibit zero linear compressibility ( ZLC) behavior under hydrostatic pressure is extremely difficult. To date , only a handful of ZLC materials have been found , and almost all of them are ultrahard materials with densified structures. Here , to explore ZLC in nondense materials , a structural model analogous to the structure of the `` Lu-Ban stool<symptom> , '' a product of traditional Chinese woodworking invented 2500 years ago , is proposed. The application of this model to borates leads to the discovery of ZLC in AEB
