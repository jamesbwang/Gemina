 The study evaluated the effects of two sphingosine derivatives N- ( 2-tert-butoxycarbamylhexadecyl) glutaramide ( AA) and N- ( 1-benzyloxyhexadec-2-yl) glutaramide ( OA) in different models of hypersensitivity<disease> in mice. Male Swiss mice were orally pre-treated with AA or OA ( 0.3-3 mg/kg). After 1 h , they received λ-carrageenan ( 300 μg/paw) , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS; 100 ng/paw) , bradykinin ( BK; 500 ng/paw) or prostaglandin E Animals pre-treated with AA and OA reduced hypersensitivity<disease> induced by carrageenan , LPS and BK , and modest inhibition of PGE These results demonstrate that the sphingosine derivatives AA and OA present important anti-hypersensitive effects , suggesting a possible interaction with the kinin signalling pathway. This may represent an interesting tool for the management of acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , with good bioavailability and safety.
