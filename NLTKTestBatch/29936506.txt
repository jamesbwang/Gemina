 English plantain ( Plantago lanceolata) is an important weed pollen allergen source triggering allergic symptoms<symptom> during summer. To elucidate genuine versus cross-reactive sensitization , we investigated IgE reactivity patterns and inhibition capacities of plantain-sensitized patients. Sera of 35 rhinoconjunctivitis patients from the north-east of France with positive skin prick tests ( SPT) to Plantago lanceolata pollen were tested with clinically relevant allergen sources using ELISA , ImmunoCAP , and immunoblot inhibition. The patients were multisensitized with additional reactivity to grass ( 94.3 %) , ash ( 74.3 %) , birch ( 71.4 %) , and mugwort ( 55.2 %) pollen in SPT. Sensitization prevalence to allergen molecules was 34.3 % ( Pla l 1) , 94.3 % ( Phl p 1/5) , 60.0 % ( Ole e 1) , 65.7 % ( Bet v 1) , 37.1 % ( profilin) , and 40.0 % ( CCD). In immunoblot , IgE reactivity to plantain pollen was inhibited with relevant pollen extracts and purified rPla l 1. Two sera did not reveal any IgE cross-reactivity , while reactivity to plantain was efficiently inhibited by grass pollen in the sera of 10 patients. The sera from 17 different patients could be inhibited by grass , birch , or ash pollen to varying degrees. Thus , only 37.1 % of our patients demonstrated true plantain pollen sensitization , while 62.9 % were solely positive due to IgE cross-reactive molecules from other clinically relevant pollen. Plantain pollen-sensitized patients are multi-reactors demonstrating varying and complex IgE-reactivity profiles. In vivo and in vitro tests using extracts are typically blurred due to the presence of homologous allergens or CCD in grass , birch , or ash pollen. So far , Pla l 1 represents the only indicative marker allergen for the diagnosis of genuine plantain pollen sensitization.
