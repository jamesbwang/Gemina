 The incidence of Kaposi<disease> sarcoma<disease> ( KS) has reduced as a result of the introduction of antiretroviral therapy. It is currently considered a rare disease<disease> in developed countries , and there has been a paucity of clinical papers on the subject in recent years in Europe. To analyse the clinical features and evolution of the different clinical forms of KS in the past 30 years. Patients with cutaneous lesions<symptom> of KS diagnosed during the period 1987-2016 at Bellvitge Hospital ( an 800-bed university referral centre in Barcelona , Spain) were enrolled. Data recorded included age , sex , ethnicity , involved site , number of lesions<symptom> , extracutaneous involvement , leg oedema , treatment , blood haemoglobin level , and blood cell ( leucocyte , lymphocyte<symptom> and CD4) counts. Cutaneous lesions<symptom> of KS were diagnosed in 191 patients ( 167 men , 24 women , mean ± SD age 51.95 ± 20.16 years). Clinical forms identified were classic KS ( n = 53) , acquired immunodeficiency syndrome<symptom> ( AIDS)- associated KS ( n = 118) , immunosuppression-associated KS ( n = 18) , and African endemic KS ( n = 2). The number of patients diagnosed annually reached a maximum in the 1990s because of the AIDS epidemic , and has decreased since 2000. However , both classic KS and immunosuppression-associated KS doubled from the first to the second half of the analysed period. Cutaneous lesions<symptom> involved the legs in 137 cases , and extracutaneous lesions<symptom> were detected in 32 patients. In 46 of 118 patients with AIDS , the diagnosis of KS was simultaneous to the detection of human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> infection. After a decrease in incidence since the middle of the 1990s , AIDS-associated KS continues to occur in Europe , and the number of annual cases of classic KS and immunosuppression-associated KS is increasing.
