 Targeting neuroinflammatory disturbances has been acknowledged as a potential strategy for treatment of depressive disorder in humans. Over-activation of tryptophan-degrading pathway by pro-inflammatory cytokines resulted in N-methyl-d-aspartate ( NMDA)- mediated excitotoxicity , which is implicated in pathophysiology of depression<symptom>. Gentiopicroside ( Gent) has powerful anti-inflammatory property and exhibits promising antidepressant effect in an animal model of pain/depression dyad by down-regulating GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. Therefore , the present study aimed to investigate the ability of Gent to abolish depressive-like behavior induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) in mice. Acute administration of LPS ( 0.5 mg/kg , i.p.) increased immobility time in both forced swimming test ( FST) and tail suspension test ( TST) without affecting spontaneous locomotor activity , indicative of depressive-like behavior. Gent ( 50 mg/kg , i.p.) administered once a day for three consecutive days prevented the development of depressive-like behavior induced by LPS. The antidepressant-like effect was paralleled with restoration of LPS-induced alterations in brain inflammatory mediators ( i.e. IL-1β and TNF-α). In addition , Gent prevented over-activation of indoleamine 2,3-double oxygen enzyme ( IDO) and recovered GluN2B subunit expression in the PFC challenged by LPS. In conclusion , our results suggested that Gent pretreatment provided protection against LPS-induced depressive-like behavior and the effect appeared to be demonstrated , at least partially , by blocking various steps of tryptophan-degrading pathway.
