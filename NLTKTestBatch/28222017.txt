 A perimenopausal woman presented with palpitations , hirsutism , and inability to lose weight<symptom>. Laboratory tests revealed an unusual endocrine hormonal profile including pituitary hormones ( TSH , ACTH , and prolactin) below reference intervals and gonadal ( testosterone) and adrenal ( cortisol) hormones above reference intervals. Ultimately , after a comprehensive workup including a scheduled surgical procedure , abnormal laboratories were determined due to biotin interference. Biotin ( vitamin B7) is a water-soluble vitamin and essential cofactor for the metabolism of fatty acids , glucose , and amino acids. The recommended daily intake of biotin for adults is 30 Âµg/d. Many over-the-counter products , particularly those marketed for hair , skin , and nail growth , contain biotin 100-fold of recommended daily intake. This case is unique due to the abnormalities observed not only in the well-described TSH `` sandwich '' immunoassay , but also in tests for gonadal steroids , adrenal , and pituitary hormones. Falsely high as well as falsely low results can be ascribed to biotin. Competitive immunoassays ( Fig. 1A)- in this case , tests used initially for serum cortisol and testosterone- can demonstrate falsely high results. Interference falsely lowers the immunometric `` sandwich '' immunoassay ( Fig. 1B)- in this case , TSH. Biotin effect on our patient 's endocrine testing led to decidedly abnormal findings , unnecessary medical referrals and diagnostic studies , and comprehensible psychological distress. Interference with one immunoassay , TSH , persisted a full 2 weeks after discontinuation of biotin; indeed , some tests demonstrate sensitivity to lesser quantities of biotin. Improved communication between patients , health care providers , and laboratory professionals is required concerning the likelihood of biotin interference with immunoassays.
