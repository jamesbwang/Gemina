 Inflammatory bowel disease<disease> ( IBD) may present with nonspecific symptoms<symptom> and diagnostic findings. Therefore , many diseases<disease> may mimic the clinical symptoms<symptom> , endoscopic findings , and histologic features of IBD. In this paper , we will review mimics of IBD , dividing the diseases<disease> that can imitate IBD into noninfectious and infectious causes. For each disease<disease> state , we will discuss the clinical symptoms<symptom> and endoscopic and histologic features. Finally , we will discuss how to distinguish these distinct disorders from IBD.
