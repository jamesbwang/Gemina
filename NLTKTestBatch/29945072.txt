 Following an ISIS attack , the present study examined the association between psychological distress and severe stress symptoms<symptom> with vulnerability variables: i.e. Physical proximity to the site of the terror attack , Associative memory of prior events , Danger perception and ISIS anxiety<symptom>. Using an online survey , 397 adult participants were recruited , Seventy-two hours after an ISIS terror attack , and filled out Psychological distress Patient Health Questionnaire 4 and severe stress symptoms<symptom> questionnaire as well as physical proximity to the site of the terror attack , associative memory of prior events , danger perception and ISIS anxiety<symptom> scales. Physical proximity to the site of the terror attack and ISIS anxiety<symptom> were found to be significantly associated of both psychological distress and severe stress symptoms<symptom>. Regarding danger perception , only danger perception of terror attacks was associated with both psychological distress and with severe stress symptoms<symptom>. Lastly , whereas being reminded of the 2014 Jerusalem tractor attack ( tapping to association via location) was neither associated with psychological distress nor with severe stress symptom<symptom> , the reminder of the truck attack in Berlin ( tapping into association by recency and similarity) was associated with psychological distress but not with severe stress symptoms<symptom>. The importance of the findings is discussed.
