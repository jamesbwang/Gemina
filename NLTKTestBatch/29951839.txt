 The aim was to report our experience with delayed colo-anal anastomosis ( DCA) to avoid permanent stoma for complex rectal cases evaluating short- and long-term outcomes. Nine patients who underwent DCA from 2011 to 2016 were collected and analysed case by case. We considered medical history and surgical outcomes. Long-term bowel function was evaluated using the Wexner and low anterior resection syndrome<symptom> ( LARS) score at 6 , 12 and 24 months. The range from previous surgery and salvage procedure was 337 days. All cases were performed with a full laparoscopic approach. The median length of hospital stay was 15 days. The median follow-up was 970.5 days. There was no peri-operative mortality. Two patients developed a post-operative pelvic abscess<symptom> that required redo surgery. Long-term post-operative complications were mucosal prolapsed , anastomosis retraction and anastomotic stricture. The average values of LARS and Wexner scores were , respectively , at 6 months 33.7 and 16.2 , at 12 months 28.5 and 11.7 , at 24 months 21.1 and 6.7. Colo-anal sleeve delayed anastomosis appears a real answer to avoid permanent stoma in selected patients. The laparoscopic procedure is safe and feasible for skilful mini-invasive surgeons. Our experience describes the complexity of clinical history of these patients underlying a slow , but progressive improvement in continence after restoration of bowel continuity.
