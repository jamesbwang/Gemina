 The causative effect of GM-CSF produced by cardiac fibroblasts to development of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> has not been shown. We identified the pathological GM-CSF-producing cardiac fibroblast subset and the specific deletion of IL-17A signaling to these cells attenuated cardiac inflammation and heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. We describe here the CD45
