 Because the extensive use of Cu-based fungicides , the accumulation of Cu in agricultural soil has been widely reported. However , little information is known about the bioavailability of Cu deriving from different fungicides in soil. This paper investigated both the distribution behaviors of Cu from two commonly used fungicides ( Bordeaux mixture and copper oxychloride) during the aging process and the toxicological effects of Cu on earthworms. Copper nitrate was selected as a comparison during the aging process. The distribution process of exogenous Cu into different soil fractions involved an initial rapid retention<symptom> ( the first 8 weeks) and a following slow continuous retention<symptom>. Moreover , Cu mainly moved from exchangeable and carbonate fractions to Fe-Mn oxides-combined fraction during the aging process. The Elovich model fit well with the available Cu aging process , and the transformation rate was in the order of Cu ( NO
