 Hypertension is one of the chronic side effects of dexamethasone ( DEX) treatment; however , almost nothing is known about its acute effects. Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the possible mechanisms involved in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control after acute or short-term DEX treatment in adult animals. Eighty Wistar rats were divided into four groups: C1 and C5 , for rats treated with saline for 1 or 5 days , respectively; D1 and D5 , for rats treated with DEX for 1 or 5 days , respectively ( decadron , 1 mg/kg , i.p.). Heart rate was increased in DEX treatment , but arterial pressure and cardiac muscle mass were not altered. Only few and isolated changes on gene expression and protein level of renin-angiotensin system components were observed. Five days of DEX treatment , but not one day , determined an increase in sympathetic component of spectral analysis ( +75.93 % , P < .05) and a significant reduction of parasympathetic component ( -18.02 % , P < .05) , which contributed to the autonomic imbalance to the heart ( LF/HF , +863.69 %). The results of this present study demonstrated , for the first time , that short-term exposure to DEX treatment impairs the autonomic balance to the heart before hypertension , which was independent of renin-angiotensin system.
