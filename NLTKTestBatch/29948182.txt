 Mounting research evidence suggests that motor resonance ( MR , i.e. , the mapping of others ' actions onto one 's own motor repertoire) can be influenced by diverse factors related to individual differences. However , no evidence has been reported so far on the effects of physical appearance and negative attitudes toward obesity to the mechanism of MR. Thirty-six participants ( 18 normal-weight and 18 overweight) performed a weight<symptom> discrimination task , in which they were observing amateur actors reaching and grasping a light or heavy cube with or without deception ( true vs. fake actions). At the end of each video clip , participants were instructed to indicate the correct cube size ( light or heavy). Importantly , body similarity between observers and actors was manipulated by presenting videos of normal-weight or overweight actors. Fat phobic attitudes and automatic preference for normal-weight than obese people were also examined. Signal detection analysis ( d') on the acquired accuracy data has shown that both normal- and overweight participants were able to better discriminate truthful actions when performed by the normal-weight as compared to overweight actors. Furthermore , this finding was negatively correlated with increased scores of fat phobic attitudes in both groups. Hence , for the first time , we provide experimental evidence of action simulation being modulated by an implicit visual sensitivity towards slim bodies.
