 To investigate the levels of agreement between self-reported responses to the Adult Pre-exercise Screening System ( APSS) questionnaire using online versus face-to-face ( F2F) modalities. Convenience sample of adults completing a pre-exercise screening questionnaire using different modalities. Adult volunteers ( n = 94) were recruited to complete the APSS using both online and F2F modalities. Participants were provided a URL link to an online APSS questionnaire then followed-up the next day in a F2F interview. Objective health risk factors were also measured. Comparisons between responses were undertaken using kappa and correlation statistics to determine levels of agreement. The levels of agreement between online versus F2F responses for the seven compulsory Stage 1 questions ( known diseases<disease> and signs and/or symptoms<symptom> of disease<disease>) were > 94 % ( kappa = 0.644-0.794). Response comparisons for Stage 2 questions on health risk factors were also generally high ( > 82 % agreement) but there were larger differences between reported and measured risk factors in Stage 3. Levels of agreement between the Stage 1 responses were substantial and support the use of this online option for pre-exercise screening. There were larger differences between self-reported and objectively measured health risk factors in Stages 2 and 3.
