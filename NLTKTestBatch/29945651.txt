 In South Asia , where most stillbirths<symptom> and neonatal deaths occur , much remains unknown about the causes of these deaths. About one-third of neonatal deaths are attributed to prematurity , yet the specific conditions which cause these deaths are often unclear as is the etiology of stillbirths<symptom>. In low-resource settings , most women are not routinely tested for infections<disease> and autopsy is rare. This prospective , cohort study will be conducted in hospitals in Davengere , India and Karachi , Pakistan. All women who deliver either a stillbirth<symptom> or a preterm birth at one of the hospitals will be eligible for enrollment. With consent , the participant and , when applicable , her offspring , will be followed to 28-days post-delivery. A series of research tests will be conducted to determine infection<disease> and presence of other conditions which may contribute to the death. In addition , all routine clinical investigations will be documented. For both stillbirths<symptom> and preterm neonates who die â‰¤ 28 days , with consent , a standard autopsy as well as minimally invasive tissue sampling will be conducted. Finally , an expert panel will review all available data for stillbirths<symptom> and neonatal deaths to determine the primary and contributing causes of death using pre-specified guidance. This will be among the first studies to prospectively obtain detailed information on causes of stillbirth<symptom> and preterm neonatal death in low-resource settings in Asia. Determining the primary causes of death will be important to inform strategies most likely to reduce the high mortality rates in South Asia.
