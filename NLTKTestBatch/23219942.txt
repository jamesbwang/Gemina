 Atlantic<disease> salmon farming operates with high production intensities where skin integrity is recognized as a central factor and indicator for animal health and welfare. In the described trial , the skin development and its immune status<symptom> in healthy Atlantic<disease> salmon reared in two different systems , a traditional open net-pen system and a semi-closed containment system , were investigated. Freshwater smolts were compared to post-smolts after 1 and 4 months in seawater. Growth performance , when adjusted for temperature , was equal between the systems. Skin analyses , including epidermis and dermis , showed that thickness and mucus cell numbers increased in pace with the growth and time post seawater transfer ( PST). Gene expression changes suggested similar processes with development of connective tissue , formation of extracellular matrix and augmented cutaneous secretion , changes in mucus protein composition and overall increased immune activity related to gradually enforced protection against pathogens. Results suggest a gradual morphological development in skin with a delayed recovery of immune functions PST. It is possible that Atlantic<disease> salmon could experience increased susceptibility to infectious<disease> agents<disease> and risk of diseases<disease> during the first post-smolt period.
