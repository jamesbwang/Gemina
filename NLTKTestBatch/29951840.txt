 The purpose of our analysis was to assess the effects of pulmonary hypertension ( PH) on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures. Pulmonary hypertension alters physiologic patterns that has the potential to complicate laparoscopic procedures , however , an in-depth analysis evaluating survival outcomes , complications , and associated comorbidities has not been done before. Data from the National Inpatient Survey were used to identify 179,663 patients without PH and 1453 patients with PH undergoing laparoscopic procedures from the years 2003-2013. In patients with pulmonary hypertension , the presence of the following comorbidities , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( OR 3.56) diabetes with chronic complications ( OR 3.74) fluid and electrolyte disorders ( OR 7.34) metastatic cancer ( OR 14.42) and peripheral vascular disease<disease> ( OR 3.12) increased in-patient mortality. In regards to post-operative complications , patients with PH were more likely to have cardiac complications defined as cardiac arrest , cardiac insufficiency , cardiorespiratory failure , or heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( OR 3.74). Patients with PH were also more likely to develop iatrogenic pneumothorax ( OR 4.13) iatrogenic pulmonary embolism ( OR 7.65) and post-operative urinary complications ( OR 1.92). Overall , the comorbidity with the highest association with in-patient mortality was metastatic cancer and of all complications , patients with PH were most likely to develop iatrogenic pulmonary embolism. Preparing for these adversities , notably in patients with certain associated conditions has the potential to improve patient outcome.
