 To investigate the fixation behavior in macular dystrophy using microperimetry. This retrospective study included patients with macular dystrophy and unilateral macular pucker. Macular dystrophic eyes were compared based on fixation within or outside of the atrophic region. The normal fellow eyes in patients with unilateral macular pucker formed the control group. Clinical and demographic characteristics of age , sex , best-corrected visual acuity , spherical equivalent , and fixation behavior ( which included foveal mean sensitivity ( MS) , fixation MS , MS improvement , stability , centrality , and eccentric distance of fixation) were analyzed. A total of 58 patients were recruited , comprising 29 eyes of 29 patients in the macular dystrophy group and 29 eyes of 29 patients in the control group. Compared to the control group , patients with macular dystrophy had significantly poorer visual acuity , foveal MS , fixation MS , stability , and centrality , and more eccentric preferred retinal locations ( PRLs). In macular dystrophy , the PRLs were most common on the superior side ( 48.3 %). Compared to fixation in the atrophic region , PRLs out of the atrophic lesion<symptom> gained more MS ( 7.41 vs. 0.89 dB , p = 0.001) , although with less stable fixation ( 10.0 vs. 47.4 % , p = 0.044). By multivariate linear regression , eccentric distance was found to be significantly associated with MS improvement ( p = 0.023). The commonest location of PRLs in macular dystrophy is anatomically superior to the lesion<symptom>. The dystrophic eye can gain better sensitivity by using PRLs outside the atrophic area.
