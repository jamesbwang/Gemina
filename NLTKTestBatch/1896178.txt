 We report a patient who presented with endocapsular capsule tension ring ( CTR) in iridocorneal angle leading to secondary angle closure glaucoma ( ACG) and subsequent removal of the CTR from trabeculectomy ostium. Secondary ACG was diagnosed 2 years and 6 months after cataract surgery in which a CTR was used for zonular instability. CTR removal with trabeculectomy was performed , after which there was the resolution of symptoms<symptom>. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first case report in which CTR was removed from trabeculectomy ostium. We describe a surgical technique to explant CTR and combining with trabeculectomy.
