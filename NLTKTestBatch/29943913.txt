 To describe the characteristics of pediatric cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( EGPA) , a systemic necrotizing vasculitis rarely diagnosed in children , retrieved from the French Reference Center for rare pediatric lung diseases<disease> and compared with adult cases included in the French Vasculitis Study Group cohort. We collected information on pediatric EGPA disease<disease> presentation , management , and outcome. Cases met the Lanham criteria and/or American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. Fourteen cases of pediatric EGPA were included , from 1980 to 2012 , with a median follow-up of 58.5 months. Median age at diagnosis was 12.3 years. All cases had respiratory<symptom> involvement<symptom>. The organ systems most frequently involved were the upper airway ( 85 %) , skin ( 71 %) , digestive tract<symptom> ( 64 %) , and<symptom> heart ( 57 %). Neurological and renal<symptom> involvement<symptom> were rare. Four of the fourteen children were positive for ANCA ( 30.7 %). During follow-up , three children required intensive care and one child died. The relapse rate was 64 %. In comparison with an adult cohort , we found more ENT , heart , and digestive-tract involvement , and fewer neurological manifestations. In children , the delay between asthma onset and diagnosis was shorter , and biopsies showed fewer features of vasculitis. This French cohort is the biggest pediatric EGPA series described to date , with a long follow-up period. The findings confirm that pediatric EGPA has specific clinical , radiological , and histological characteristics that differ from adult EGPA. Development of systemic symptoms<symptom> , and consequently diagnosis , occur with a shorter delay in children , mainly during the eosinophilic phase and leading to a specific presentation.
