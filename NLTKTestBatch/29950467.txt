 This study investigated the relationship between presenteeism and health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) among Japanese adults with chronic lower back<symptom> pain<symptom> ( CLBP). This was a retrospective , cross-sectional study. Data were collected via a self-administered online survey of the Japanese adult general population. The present study used 2014 Japan National Health and Wellness Survey ( NHWS) data ( n = 30000). Specifically , data were included from NHWS respondents who self-reported being employed in the past week and having experienced LBP in the past month , with these symptoms<symptom> lasting for at least 3 months ( n = 239). 84 ( 35.1 %) participants in this study were female. Presenteeism and HRQoL were measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-General Health ( categorical ( none: 0 % , low: 10 % -20 % , high: ≥ 30 %) and continuous) and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey , respectively. Covariates included patient demographics , health characteristics , pain characteristics and depression<symptom> severity ( Patient Health Questionnaire). Presenteeism was reported by 77.4 % of respondents. High ( vs no) presenteeism related to more severe<symptom> pain<symptom> in the prior week ( 4.9 ± 2.2 vs 3.6 ± 2.1 , p = 0.001) and currently ( 5.1 ± 2.1 vs 3.9 ± 3.9 , p = 0.007) , more pain sites ( 1.9 ± 1.6 vs 1.1 ± 1.4 , p = 0.004) and greater depression<symptom> severity ( 7.5 ± 6.5 vs 3.6 ± 3.6 , p < 0.001). Adjusting for covariates , high ( vs no) presenteeism related to lower mental and physical HRQoL. For low versus no presenteeism , significant HRQoL differences were observed in general health ( 43.0 , 95 % CI 40.3 to 45.6 vs 46.9 , 95 % CI 43.9 to 49.8 , p = 0.015). Most respondents experienced presenteeism. Those with high or low presenteeism had poorer HRQoL than respondents with no presenteeism. Monitoring presenteeism rates may help identify workers with an unmet need for better CLBP-related pain management.
