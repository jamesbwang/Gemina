 Among non-tuberculous mycobacteria<pathogen> ( NTM) , the Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> simiae<pathogen> complex is one of the largest groups , consisting of 18 species of slow-growing mycobacteria<pathogen>. In 2009 , a case of NTM-associated infectious skin disease<disease> was reported in Shiga Prefecture , Japan. The patient presented with scattered nodules<disease> on the chest , back and extremities , and an M. simiae-like organism was isolated from skin biopsy specimens obtained from one of these lesions<symptom>. Based on several assessments , including multiple-gene analyses , biochemical characterization and drug susceptibility testing , we concluded that this isolate represented a novel species of NTM , and proposed the name ` Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> shigaense '. Since 2009 , five more cases of NTM-associated infectious<disease> disease<disease> in which there was a suspected involvement of 'M. shigaense ' have been reported. Interestingly , four of these six cases occurred in Shiga Prefecture. Here we performed multiple-gene phylogenetic analyses , physiological and biochemical characterization tests , drug susceptibility tests , and profiling of proteins , fatty acids and mycolic acids of eight clinical isolates from the six suspected 'M. shigaense ' cases. The results confirmed that all of the clinical isolates were 'M. shigaense ' , a slow-growing , scotochromogenic species. Here M. shigaense is validly proposed as a new member of the M.<pathogen> simiae<pathogen> complex , with the type strain being UN-152
