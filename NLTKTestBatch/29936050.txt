 When conducting analyses of child weight<symptom> growth trajectories , researchers commonly use Z-scores from a standard instead of the observed weights. However , these Z-scores , calculated from cross-sectional data , may introduce methodological limitations when used in the context of longitudinal analyses. We assessed analytic limitations when analyzing infant growth data with three anthropometric measures: weight<symptom> and the corresponding Z-scores and percentiles from a standard. We undertook a series of Monte Carlo simulations and compared tests of differences in postnatal weight<symptom> change across time ( growth velocity) between two exposure groups. Models with the observed weight<symptom> outcome were compared to the corresponding weight<symptom> World Health Organization ( WHO) Z-score or weight<symptom> percentile outcomes. We calculated power , type I error , and median product term coefficient estimates to assess differences between the models. There was lower power to detect velocity differences across exposure groups for WHO Z-scores and percentiles as outcomes compared to the use of observed weight<symptom> values. We also noted instances in which velocity differences between exposed and unexposed groups were in the opposite direction in analyses with WHO Z-score outcomes. In our simulations of infant weight<symptom> velocity differences across exposure groups , we observed lower power and effect inconsistencies when applying a standard-derived Z-score transformation. These results emphasize the need for careful consideration of the appropriate scale when assessing infant growth trajectories across categorical groups.
