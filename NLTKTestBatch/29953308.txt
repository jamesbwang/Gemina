 To investigate the role of some blood count-derived inflammation biomarkers in age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). Seventy-nine men with late-stage AMD and 79 male age-matched cataract controls without AMD were recruited in March-December , 2016. A blood sample was taken. The following blood cell count-derived indexes were evaluated: neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) , derived NLR ( dNLR = neutrophils/ ( white blood cells neutrophils)) , platelet/lymphocyte ratio ( PLR) , monocyte/lymphocyte ratio ( MLR) , ( neutrophils × monocytes)/ lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( SIRI) , and ( neutrophils × monocytes × platelets)/ lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( AISI). AMD patients had significantly lower median values of white blood cells , monocytes , neutrophils , platelets , and mean platelet volume ( MPV). Regarding the combined indexes , only AISI was significantly lower in AMD patients than in controls. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the ability of AISI and MPV to predict AMD is poor. Results suggests that NLR , dNLR , PLR , MLR , SIRI , and AISI are unreliable disease<disease> biomarkers in men with AMD. Larger scale studies are necessary to confirm these findings.
