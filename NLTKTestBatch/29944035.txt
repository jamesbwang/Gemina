 Clerkship-specific interactive reflective writing ( IRW)- enhanced reflection may enhance professional identity formation ( PIF) , a fundamental goal of medical education. PIF process as revealed in students? reflective writing ( RW) has been understudied. The authors developed an IRW curriculum within a Family Medicine Clerkship ( FMC) and analyzed students? reflections about challenging/difficult patient encounters using immersion-crystallization qualitative analysis. The qualitative analysis identified 26 unique emergent themes and five distinct thematic categories ( 1. Role of emotions , 2. Role of cognition , 3. Behaviorally responding to situational context , 4. Patient factors , and 5. External factors) as well as an emergent PIF model from a directed content analysis. The model describes students? backgrounds , emotions and previous experiences in medicine merging with external factors and processed during student?patient interactions. The RWs also revealed that processing often involves polarities ( e.g. empathy/lack of empathy or encouragement/disillusionment) as well as dissonance between idealized visions<symptom> and lived reality. IRW facilitates and ideally supports grappling with the lived reality of medicine; uncovering a `` positive hidden curriculum '' within medical education. The authors propose engaging learners in guided critical reflection about complex experiences for meaning-making within a safe learning climate as a valuable way to cultivate reflective , resilient professionals with `` prepared '' minds and<symptom> hearts<symptom> for inevitable challenges of healthcare practice.
