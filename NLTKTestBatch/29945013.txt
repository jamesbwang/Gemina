 Vascular pineal malformations are rare , and technically demanding lesions<symptom>. Due to their location , in the last decades , endovascular techniques and radiosurgery have been increasingly used to accomplish a safe occlusion. Nevertheless , sometimes , microsurgical treatment may be required. We present a retrospective review of the vascular pineal malformations operated by the senior author. Moreover , we report illustrative cases for the various types of vascular lesions<symptom> with a careful analysis of the different microsurgical stages. Eighteen patients with pineal vascular lesions<symptom> were operated on between 1980 and 2015: 6 patients had vein of Galen malformations , 5 plexiform arteriovenous malformations , 6 cavernous malformations , and one patient had a ruptured medial posterior choroidal artery aneurysm<disease>. A complete resection/occlusion was possible in all vascular malformations. The pineal region is an infrequent but challenging location for vascular lesions<symptom>. A careful and stepwise operative strategy for the different types of vascular lesion<symptom> is paramount to accomplish an effective and safe microsurgical treatment , when other alternatives fail or are not available.
