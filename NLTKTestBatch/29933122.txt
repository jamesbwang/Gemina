 Arthroscopic meniscectomy and medial meniscal repair are frequent procedures , liable to be complicated by iatrogenic cartilage lesions<symptom> , especially in tight knee. Medial collateral ligament pie-crusting was developed to counter this , but , although the technique is employed , its impact on medial laxity has not been precisely determined. We therefore conducted a prospective observational study to compare radiographic laxity preoperatively versus 6 weeks following pie-crusting. Medial collateral ligament pie-crusting alters radiographic laxity at 6 weeks. Between December 2015 and February 2017 , 40 patients ( 33 male , 7 female) underwent surgery with pie-crusting for isolated medial meniscal lesion<symptom>. Mean age was 39 years ( range , 20-54 years). Meniscectomy was performed in 33 cases ( 82.5 %) and repair in 7 ( 17.5 %). Pie-crusting used an intramuscular needle under arthroscopic control , adjacent to the medial meniscus at the posterior two-thirds junction of the compartment , until opening was deemed satisfactory. Laxity was compared on preoperative versus 6 weeks stress valgus views ( Telos ™) , by 2 independent observers , on 2 measurements: opening angle , and medial tibiofemoral joint space height. Each measurement was taken twice at a 2-week interval by each observer. Inter- and intra-observer concordance was excellent on both measurements: intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.82 ( 95 % CI , 0.73-0.89) and 0.91 ( 95 % CI , 0.86-0.94) pre- and post-operatively for opening angle , and 0.87 ( 95 % CI , 0.79-0.92) and 0.88 ( 95 % CI , 0.82-0.92) for joint space height. Tibiofemoral joint space opening was significantly greater at 6 weeks on both measurements: 0.9 ± 1 ° ( range , -1 ° to 4 °) ( p < 0.0001) and 1.1 ± 1 mm ( range , -0.6 to 3.2 mm) ( p < 0.0001). Medial collateral ligament pie-crusting led to a moderate but significant increase in medial laxity at 6 weeks. A longer-term study is needed to assess progression.
