 A 23-year-old man , diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome<symptom> and who had undergone several catheter ablations , presented 2 months after the most recent ablation with cardiac tamponade following physical exertion. Emergency surgery revealed a perforation between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium. This perforation was repaired with a bovine pericardium patch. To our knowledge , this is the first case of delayed cardiac tamponade after catheter ablation due to a Valsalva manoeuvre ( such as weightlifting) in a patient with a normal international normalized ratio and normal platelet count.
