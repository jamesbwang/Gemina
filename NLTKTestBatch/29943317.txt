 Strains of the same Leishmania<pathogen> parasite species , isolated from different host organisms , may exhibit unique infection profiles and induce a change in the expression of microRNAs among host macrophages and in model host mice. MicroRNAs ( MiR) are endogenous molecules of about 22 nucleotides that are involved in many regulatory processes , including the vertebrate host immune response. In this respect , the infectivity and susceptibility to antimonials of two L. infantum strains , BH46 , isolated from human , and OP46 , isolated from symptomatic dog , were characterized in J774 macrophages and BALB/c mice. Parasite burden was assessed in the liver , spleen , and bone<disease> marrow using the serial limiting dilution technique. A higher parasite burden was observed in the spleen and bone<disease> marrow of animals infected with OP46 compared to BH46 strain. Our results also showed that OP46 was less susceptible to the antimonials. In addition , miR-122 and miR-155 expression was evaluated in the liver and J774 macrophages , and in spleens<symptom> from infected animals , respectively. An increase was observed in the expression of miR-155 in J774 macrophages infected with both strains compared to uninfected cells , with a higher expression in cells infected with OP46. However , no difference in the expression of miR-122 and miR-155 was observed in the infected animals. Thus , this study shows that OP46 was more infective for mice , it caused a higher increase in miR-155 expression in infected macrophages and was less susceptible to the antimonials evaluated. These data suggest that alteration in miR-155 level likely plays a role in regulating the response to L. infantum.
