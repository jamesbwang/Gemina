 Background Obesity is associated with oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase ( SOD) is the first line of defense against reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , eliminating the strong superoxide radical and producing H2O2 , which can then be degraded by catalase ( CAT). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the gene expression antioxidant enzymes ( Mn-SOD and CAT) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) of obese and normal-weight children , and its association with anthropometric and biochemical parameters. Methods Thirty obese and 30 control subjects between the ages of 8 and 16 years were enrolled in this study. Serum insulin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , and insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR). Biochemical parameters were also measured. PBMCs of the subjects were separated and Mn-SOD and CAT gene expression was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR). Results Mn-SOD and CAT gene expression was significantly lower in the obese group compared with the control group ( p < 0.01). Also , a positive correlation was observed between the gene expression of Mn-SOD and CAT and body mass index ( BMI) , fasting blood sugar , insulin resistance , low density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C) cholesterol , triglycerides ( TG) and systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP). Conclusions Induction of antioxidants , especially Mn-SOD and CAT , can lead to reduction of oxidative stress and prevent the complications of obesity in children.
