 Rotavirus<pathogen> and norovirus<pathogen> are infectious pathogens primarily affecting children under 5 years old. The impact of rainfall on diarrheal diseases<disease> remains inconclusive. This study aimed to evaluate the association between short-term variation in rainfall , temperature and humidity , and rotavirus<pathogen> and norovirus<pathogen> hospitalizations among young children in Hong Kong. Generalized additive negative binomial regression models with distributed lag non-linear terms , were fit with daily counts of hospital admissions due to rotavirus<pathogen> and norovirus<pathogen> infection as the outcomes and daily total rainfall and other meteorological variables as predictors , adjusting for seasonality and trend. Generally , greater rainfall was associated with fewer rotavirus<pathogen> , but more norovirus hospitalizations. Extreme precipitation ( 99.5 mm , 99th percentile) was found to be associated with 0.40 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.20-0.79) and 1.93 ( 95 % CI 1.21-3.09) times the risk of hospitalization due to rotavirus<pathogen> and norovirus<pathogen> infection respectively , relative to trace rainfall. Stronger associations were observed in winter for rotavirus<pathogen> and in summer for norovirus<pathogen>. The duration of association with rotavirus<pathogen> was notably longer than norovirus<pathogen>. Higher temperatures were found to be associated with fewer hospitalizations for both rotavirus<pathogen> and norovirus<pathogen> infection , while higher relative humidity was generally associated with more norovirus<pathogen> , but fewer rotavirus<pathogen> , hospitalizations. Both rotavirus<pathogen> and norovirus<pathogen> hospitalizations were strongly associated with recent precipitation variation but in opposite directions. With the introduction of the rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine norovirus<pathogen> is likely to become a greater threat than rotavirus<pathogen> and thus greater precipitation may become more clearly associated with more childhood diarrhea<disease><symptom>.
