 Information and Communication Technologies ( ICTs) have been utilised globally for advancing social and economic development. As information becomes key to enlightening development initiatives , the role of mobile technology-based ICT services is becoming more significant. The aim of this study was to design and implement a mHealth data model with an intention of improving mothers ' knowledge of Reproductive and Child Health ( RCH) services in rural environments and to remind mothers who do not have access to mobile phones to attend antenatal care. The methodology adopted in this research was participatory action research. A phased approach was utilised to answer the research question. The phases were: diagnosis of the problem , action planning , action taking , evaluation and reflection. The study was conducted in Chamwino district of Dodoma region , Tanzania. Reproductive and Child Health sections of Buigiri dispensary and Chamwino health centre were purposively selected. Data were collected through key informant interviews , document review , focus group discussion and observation. Content analysis methods were utilised during analysis. Consequently , the data model was designed , implemented and evaluated. Challenges of information dissemination in low resource settings noted in this study are: mobile phone ownership and access of mothers , vertical coordination<symptom> of health services and low staffing levels of health workers. Mothers who do not own mobile phones can leverage phone ownership of community leaders , TBAs , CHWs and relatives. This in turn facilitates communication of health messages to mothers. Although this study was conducted in a low resource setting , mobile network coverage was good and thus SMS technology could be used. Research should be conducted on how to disseminate similar information in remote areas without mobile coverage.
