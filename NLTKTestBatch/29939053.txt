 Little is known about the extent to which previous weeks ' stressful events spill over and influence adolescents ' abilities to derive insight from treatment sessions. Even less is known about factors that moderate clients ' vulnerabilities to these spillover effects. The current study examined the spillover of negative interpersonal events to postsession insight and the role of difficulties in emotion regulation in this spillover effect. Participants were 129 adolescents with moderate<symptom> to severe depressive symptoms<symptom> and suicidal ideation ( Mage = 14.96 , 83 % female , 56 % African American/Black) participating in a comparative efficacy trial of Attachment-Based Family Therapy ( ABFT) and Family-Enhanced Nondirective Supportive Therapy ( FE-NST). A within-subject mediation model tested presession negative affect as a mediator of spillover of past week 's events on postsession insight. We then examined baseline difficulties in emotion regulation ( DERS) as a between-subjects moderator of the mediation model. Negative affect partially mediated ( 44 %) the spillover of the past week 's negative events on adolescents ' ratings of postsession insight ( p = .03 , 95 % confidence interval , CI ( -.09. , -.002)). Baseline DERS increased adolescents ' vulnerabilities to spillover effects ( p = .01 , 95 % CI ( -.28 , -.03)). Negative interpersonal events from the past week influence presession negative affect and spill over to adolescents ' abilities to gain insight from their treatment sessions. Adolescents who began treatment with greater DERS were particularly vulnerable to these spillover effects. Findings indicate the need for therapists to adapt sessions to individual differences in depressed and suicidal adolescents ' exposure to negative interpersonal events preceding treatment and in their vulnerabilities to spillover and emotion dysregulation.
