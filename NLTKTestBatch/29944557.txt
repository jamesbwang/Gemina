 To compare the efficacy of dental plaque removal between manual and powered toothbrushes in individuals with syndactyly. Seventeen patients with Apert syndrome<symptom> aged 11 to 30 years. The efficacy of toothbrushing was evaluated by the O'Leary plaque index at 2 periods: initial ( before toothbrushing) and final ( immediately after toothbrushing) , using manual toothbrush ( Colgate Twister) and powered toothbrush ( Colgate Actibrush). Means were compared by the ANOVA test at a significance level of 5 %. The reduction in the plaque index was different for each type of toothbrush ( interaction factor between manual and powered toothbrushes and initial and final periods , P = 0.026). The powered toothbrush provided greater reduction of dental plaque than the manual toothbrush. In individuals with syndactyly , both manual and powered toothbrushes allowed significant plaque reduction on tooth surfaces; however , the powered toothbrush exhibited greater efficacy of plaque removal compared with the manual toothbrush.
