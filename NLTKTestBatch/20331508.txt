 Exercise programmes typically are evaluated with fitness assessments and psychological survey measures but seldom include participants ' insights. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefits , facilitators and barriers of a 12-week exercise programme for post-bariatric surgery patients from the participants ' perspective. Over a 2-year period , 20 patients recently having undergone bariatric surgery completed a 12-week programme that included participation in structured exercise and in focus groups designed to supplement standard evaluation data and provide insight into participants ' views. Participants were highly adherent to the programme , and focus group results reflected a clear positive evaluations. Benefits included helpful information , developing commitment , physical fitness and social support; notably , weight<symptom> was seldom mentioned. Participants cited structure , accountability and group support as facilitators of exercise. Participants cited few barriers , although very few had set plans for continuing exercise after programme completion. Participants saw many benefits to the exercise programme , and those benefits reflected lifestyle changes rather than a focus on weight<symptom>. Programme structure , accountability and the support of the group were facilitators to exercise. Participants cited few barriers. However , the lack of plans for continued exercise suggested the need for a transition phase to help participants continue an active lifestyle after the 12-week structured programme.
