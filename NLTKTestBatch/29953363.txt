 Hericium erinaceus is an edible and medicinal mushroom with potential neuroprotective effects. The study of H. erinaceus has attracted considerable attention during the past 10 years , particularly with regard to its potential utility in the treatment of motor<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> , Alzheimer disease<disease> , and other forms of dementia. We previously determined that oral supplementation with H. erinaceus results in significant improvements in novelty-seeking behavior and novel object recognition in mice. In this study , H. erinaceus was added to the diets of wild-type mice for 2 months , and effects on spatial memory were evaluated by means of a Y maze and an object location task. We found that H. erinaceus increased general locomotor activity but had no effect on spatial memory. Thus , oral supplementation with H. erinaceus yields specific and selective improvements in recognition memory without altering spatial working memory , which supports the hypothesis that recognition memory can be modeled as a dual process. In this model , the perirhinal cortex supports the recognition of individual items as part of a circuit involved in familiarity with an encountered stimulus , whereas the hippocampus supports recollected associations and relationships between stimuli.
