 Using an orthotopic model of ovarian cancer , we studied the delivery of siRNA in nanoparticles of tri-block copolymers consisting of hyperbranched polyethylenimine-graft-polycaprolactone-block-poly ( ethylene glycol) ( hyPEI-g-PCL-b-PEG) with and without a folic acid targeting ligand. A SKOV-3/ LUC FRα overexpressing cell line was employed to mimic the clinical manifestations of ovarian cancer. Both targeted and non-targeted micelleplexes were able to effectively deliver siRNA to the primary tumor and its metastases , as measured by gamma scintillation counting and confocal microscopy. Stability of the micelleplexes was demonstrated with a serum albumin binding study. Regarding biodistribution , intravenous ( I.V.) administration showed a slight advantage of FRα targeted over non-targeted micelleplex accumulation within the tumor. However , both formulations displayed significant liver uptake. On the other hand , intraperitoneally ( I.P.) injected mice showed a modest 6 % of the injected dose per gram ( ID/g) uptake within the primary and most interestingly also in the metastatic lesions<symptom> which subsequently resulted in a 62 % knockdown of firefly luciferase expression in the tumor after a single injection. While this is , to the best of our knowledge , the first paper that correlates quantitative tumor accumulation in an orthotopic tumor model with in vivo gene silencing , these data demonstrate that PEI-g-PCL-b-PEG-Fol conjugates are a promising option for gene knockdown in ovarian cancer.
