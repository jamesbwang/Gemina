 There is accumulating evidence that spontaneous<symptom> fluctuations<symptom> of the brain are sustained by a structural architecture of axonal fiber bundles. Various models have been employed to investigate this structure-function relationship. In this work , we implemented the Ising model using the number of fibers between each pair of brain regions as input. The output of the Ising model simulations on a structural connectome was then compared with empirical functional connectivity data. A simpler 2-dimensional classical Ising model was used as the baseline model for comparison purpose. Thermodynamic properties , such as the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat , illustrated a phase transition from an ordered phase to a disordered phase at the critical temperature. Despite the differences between the two models , the lattice Ising model and the Ising model implemented on a structural connectome ( the generalized Ising model) exhibited similar patterns of the global properties. To study the behaviour of the generalized Ising model around criticality , calculation of the dimensionality and critical exponents was performed for the first time , by introducing a new concept of distance based on structural connectivity. Same value inside the fitting error was found for the dimensionality in both models suggesting similar behaviour of the models around criticality.
