 After leaving the testis , sperm undergo two sequential maturational processes before acquiring fertilizing capacity: sperm maturation in the male epididymis , and sperm capacitation in the female reproductive tract<symptom>. During their transit through the epididymis , sperm experience several maturational changes; the acquisition of motility is one of them. The molecular basis of the regulation of this process is still not fully understood. Sperm are both transcriptionally and translationally silent , therefore post-translational modifications are essential to regulate their function. The post-translational modification by the addition of O-linked Î²-N-acetylglucosamine ( O-GlcNAc) can act as a counterpart of phosphorylation in different cellular processes. Therefore , our work was aimed to characterize the O-GlcNAcylation system in the male reproductive tract<symptom> and the occurrence of this phenomenon during sperm maturation. Our results indicate that O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT) , the enzyme responsible for O-GlcNAcylation , is present in the testis , epididymis and immature caput sperm. Its presence is significantly reduced in mature cauda sperm. Consistently , caput sperm display high levels of O-GlcNAcylation when compared to mature cauda sperm , where it is mostly absent. Our results indicate that the modulation of O-GlcNAcylation takes place during sperm maturation and suggest a role for this post-translational modification in this process.
