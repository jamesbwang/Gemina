 This was to evaluate the effect of visual distraction on anxiety<symptom> of children during dental treatment. This randomized , crossover clinical trial study was conducted on 28 children ( aged 4-5 years) randomly divided into two groups of 14 each. Group 1 , treatment procedure in the first visit was completed while the patients were watching a cartoon as a visual distraction tool , at the second visit , the procedure was carried out with conventional tell-show-do. Group 2 , had visual distraction in their second visit and conventional tell-show-do during the first visit. Treatment procedures were similar in both groups during two sessions. The anxiety<symptom> level was determined using Venham picture test and pulse rate ( PR) at the beginning and the end of each appointment. Patient behaviour was also scored using Frankl behaviour rating scale ( FBRS). Self-reported dental anxiety<symptom> was reduced significantly by visual distraction ( p-value < 0.001) compared to conventional tell-show-do , but it did not change FBRS scores significantly ( p-value = 0.24). Use of visual distraction improves self-reported anxiety<symptom> and decreases PR of children but does not change their behaviour.
