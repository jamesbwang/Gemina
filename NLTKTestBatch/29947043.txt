 Sugammadex is used as a reversal drug during anesthesia. Although several case reports have described anaphylaxis following sugammadex infusion , little is known about the relationship between sugammadex and anaphylaxis , particularly in pediatric patients. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the association between sugammadex and in-hospital anaphylaxis in pediatric patients who underwent general anesthesia. We identified patients who underwent general anesthesia in a Japanese national inpatient database between July 2010 and March 2016. We conducted 1-4 case-control matching between patients with and without perioperative anaphylaxis. We calculated the adjusted odds ratio for sugammadex use and occurrence of anaphylaxis , using a conditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for duration of anesthesia , antibiotics , and blood transfusions. Among 835 405 patients who underwent general anesthesia , we identified 149 ( 0.018 %) patients with anaphylactic shock<symptom> and 472 ( 0.056 %) with a combination of anaphylaxis associated signs/symptoms and skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. Sugammadex use was not significantly associated with anaphylactic shock<symptom> ( odds ratio , 0.80; 95 % confidence interval , 0.53-1.21; P = .29) or the combination of anaphylaxis associated signs/symptoms and skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> ( odds ratio , 1.25; 95 % confidence interval , 0.97-1.60; P = .08). The present study showed no significant association between sugammadex and perioperative anaphylaxis in pediatric patients who underwent general anesthesia.
