 Cognitive therapy has gained prominence in the treatment of major depression<symptom> , however , little is known about its long-term benefits when delivered during inpatient treatment or combined with outpatient treatment with severely ill inpatients ( HAM-D > 20). To evaluate this question , we conducted a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of extended clinical management ( E-CM) , psychoeducational cognitive behavioural group therapy ( PCBT-G) or PCBT-G and 16 outpatient individual treatment sessions ( PCBT-G + I). All patients were treated with pharmacotherapy. 177 inpatients with DSM-IV major depression<symptom> were randomized either to E-CM or PCBT-G or PCBT-G + I. Outcome measures were collected in the hospital at pre- and posttreatment and following discharge into the community every six months for two years. We compared the study groups on symptom<symptom> changes<symptom> , psychosocial functioning , knowledge about depression<symptom> and rehospitalization. All three treatment interventions are equally effective at reducing depressive symptoms<symptom> and increasing psychosocial functioning at posttreatment. There was significant group by time interaction for knowledge about depression<symptom> in favor of PCBT-G and PCBT-G + I over E-CM. We did not find significantly lower rehospitalisation rates at the two-year follow-up for PCBT-G + I compared to E-CM , however , comparing PCBT-G to E-CM. We conclude that with cognitive psychoeducational group therapy a successful , in the long-term other interventions superior psychological intervention for major depression<symptom> is available as gains were sustained for two years following discharge from the hospital. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of group treatment starting in inpatient treatment.
