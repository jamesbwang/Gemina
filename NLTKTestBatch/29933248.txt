 The new interdisciplinary field of network physiology is increasingly becoming a focus of interest in medicine. Autonomic nervous system ( ANS) dysfunction is well described in schizophrenia ( SZO). However , the linear and nonlinear coupling between the ANS and central nervous system ( CNS) has only been partly addressed until now. This coupling can be assumed to be a feedback-feedforward network , reacting with flexible and adaptive responses to internal and external factors. For the first time , in this study we investigated linear and nonlinear short-term central-cardiorespiratory coupling of 17 patients suffering from paranoid SZO in comparison to 17 age-gender matched healthy subjects analyzing heart rate ( HR) , respiration<symptom> ( RESP) , and the power of frontal electroencephalogram ( EEG) activity ( P We found that the CCRN in SZO can be characterized as a bidirectional one , with stronger central driving mechanisms ( P We demonstrated a considerably significantly different CCRN structure in SZO with a strong central influence on the cardiac system and a strong respiratory influence on the CNS. Moreover , this study provides a more in-depth understanding of the interplay of the central and autonomic regulatory network in healthy subjects and SZO patients.
