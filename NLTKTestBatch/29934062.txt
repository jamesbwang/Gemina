 Entospletinib ( GS-9973) is an oral , selective inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase. Entospletinib monotherapy was evaluated in a multicenter , phase II study of subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancy. The study included 43 patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL). The participants received 800 mg of the original , monomesylate formulation of entospletinib twice daily as a starting dose; the doses could be reduced because of toxicity throughout the study. No patient achieved a complete or partial response , 5 patients ( 12 %) had stable disease<disease> , and 26 patients ( 60 %) had progressive disease<disease>. Progression-free survival ( PFS) at 16 weeks was 3.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.3 % -15.3 %) , and the median PFS was 1.5 months ( 95 % CI , 1-1.7 months). The independent review committee-assessed nodal response for 27 evaluable patients showed a reduced tumor burden in 6 patients ( 22 %). The median duration of entospletinib treatment for these 6 patients was 9 weeks ( range , 3-24 weeks). One patient ( 4 %) had a decrease of ≥ 50 % in the sum of the product of the nodal diameters. The treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in ≥ 20 % of the cohort were fatigue<symptom> , nausea<symptom> , decreased appetite<symptom> , constipation<symptom> , dyspnea<symptom> , diarrhea<disease><symptom> , dehydration<symptom> , cough<symptom> , insomnia , and peripheral edema<symptom>. The common laboratory abnormalities occurring in ≥ 20 % of the subjects were lymphocytopenia , anemia<symptom> , creatinine ( chronic kidney disease<disease>) , increased aspartate aminotransferase , hypoalbuminemia , total bilirubin , hyponatremia , leukopenia<symptom> , increased alanine aminotransferase , increased alkaline phosphatase , and hyperglycemia. Entospletinib monotherapy at 800 mg twice daily demonstrated limited activity in patients with advanced , relapsed DLBCL.
