 The fear of producing malodors that can be detected by others is a daily cause of anxiety<symptom> for millions of people with incontinence. For many , the risk-whether real or imagined-that leaked waste products will be detectable by odor is sufficiently concerning to result in limitations on many types of activities. However , worry about personal odors can sensitize our olfactory system and cause us to be more aware of odors that may otherwise not be perceptible. In addition , heightened olfactory attention can often lead to odor misattributions , such as when we erroneously identify our body as the source of an odor that may simply be present in the environment. Odors produced by our bodies ( endogenous odors) do enjoy a greater access to emotional brain centers and are processed faster than general odors. Here we provide examples from both everyday life and laboratory studies to explain how and why the olfactory system is unique among our sensory systems and how this knowledge can provide insights to our concerns about smell and incontinence and inform the development of products and solutions for incontinence.
