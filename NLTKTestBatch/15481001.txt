 Functional dyspepsia ( FD) is a common upper gastrointestinal disorder worldwide , but the current treatments for FD are still unsatisfactory. The aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy and safety of Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules in patients with postprandial distress syndrome<symptom> ( PDS)- predominant FD. The study was conducted as a randomized , double-blinded , multicenter , placebo-controlled design in 197 patients with PDS. All participants received placebo treatment for 1 week. Patients whose total symptom<symptom> score decreased by < 50 % after the placebo treatment were recruited into the 4-week treatment period , in which they were randomly assigned to be treated with either Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules or placebo. The patients were then followed for 2 weeks without any treatment. Dyspeptic symptoms<symptom> were scored at weeks 2 and 4 during the random treatment period and 2 weeks after the treatment. Anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms<symptom> were also scored and compared. ( 1) The total effective rates in the Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules group at weeks 2 and 4 during the random treatment period and 2 weeks after treatment were all significantly higher than those in the placebo group ( 38.82 % vs. 8.75 % , P < 0.001; 69.14 % vs. 16.25 % , P < 0.001; 77.65 % vs. 21.25 % , P < 0.001). ( 2) The total dyspeptic symptoms<symptom> scores in the Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules group at weeks 2 and 4 and 2 weeks after treatment were significantly lower than those in the placebo group. ( 3) The severity and frequency of each dyspeptic symptom<symptom> at weeks 2 and 4 and the follow-up period were all significantly lower than those in the placebo group. ( 4) The anxiety<symptom> scores in the Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group. ( 5) Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules did not have more adverse effects than the placebo. Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules offer significant symptomatic improvement in PDS with no more adverse effects than placebo. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ , NCT02460601.
