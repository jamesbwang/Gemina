 Revisional and reconstructive surgery for IPAA is rare given the high success of pouch surgery for chronic ulcerative colitis<disease>. Limited data exist on both surgical and functional outcomes in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis<disease> who undergo IPAA revision or reconstruction. This study aimed to determine the surgical and functional outcome in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis<disease> who undergo IPAA revision or reconstruction. A prospectively collected surgical database was accessed for this study. This study was conducted at an IBD referral center. Patients with chronic ulcerative colitis<disease> who underwent IPAA revision or reconstruction were selected. The primary outcomes measured were 30-day postoperative outcomes and long-term pouch function. Eighty-one patients were identified. Original IPAA was performed for chronic ulcerative colitis<disease> ( n = 71; 88 %) and indeterminate colitis<disease> ( n = 11; 12. %) , and the most common configuration was a J-pouch ( n = 69; 86 %) with handsewn anastomosis ( n = 41; 68 %). No independent predictors of 30-day postoperative complications following reconstructive/revisional surgery were identified. Pelvic abscesses<symptom> and Crohn 's disease<disease> of the pouch were independently associated with ultimate pouch excision. Median follow-up following revision/reconstruction was 40 months ( range , 1-292 months) during which 15 patients ( 23 %) had pouch failure. The 5- and 10-year pouch survival rates following revision were 85 ± 5 % and 65 ± 9 % by Kaplan-Meier estimation; age < 30 years was significantly associated with pouch survival. Long-term function ( n = 30; 35 %) compared with a matched control cohort of primary IPAA was characterized by significantly increased daytime bowel incontinence ( p = 0.0119) , liquid stool<symptom> ( p = 0.0062) , and medication to thicken stools<symptom> ( p = 0.0452). This was a single-center series , and<symptom> response<symptom> rate for functional data was 35 %. In properly selected patients with a failing pouch , originally made for chronic ulcerative colitis<disease> or indeterminate colitis<disease> , revisional and reconstructive surgery is associated with low complication rates , high pouch salvage , and acceptable long-term pouch function.
