 Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) with rapid ventricular rate ( RVR; heart rate > 100) in noncardiac postoperative surgical patients is associated with poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the practice patterns of AF management in a surgical intensive care unit to determine practices associated with rate and rhythm control and additional outcomes. Adult patients ( ≥ 18 y) admitted to the surgical intensive care unit ( SICU) from June 2014 to June 2015 were retrospectively screened for the development of new-onset AF with RVR. Demographics , hospital course , evaluation and treatment of AF with RVR , and outcome were evaluated and analyzed. Thousand seventy patients were admitted to the SICU during the study period; 33 met inclusion criteria ( 3.1 %). Twenty-six patients ( 79 %) had rate and rhythm control within 48 h of AF with RVR onset. β-Blockers were the most commonly used initial medication ( 67 %) but were successful at rate and rhythm control in only 27 % of patients ( 6/22). Amiodarone had the highest rate of success if used initially ( 5/6 , 83 %) and secondarily ( 11/13 , 85 %). Failure to control rate and rhythm was associated with a greater likelihood of comorbidities ( 100 % versus 57 %; P = 0.06). New-onset AF with RVR in the noncardiac postoperative patient is associated with a high mortality ( 21 %). Amiodarone is the most effective treatment for rate and rhythm control. Failure to establish rate and rhythm control was associated with cardiac comorbidities. These results will help to form future algorithms for the treatment of AF with RVR in the SICU.
