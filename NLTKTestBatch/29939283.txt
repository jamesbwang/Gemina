 Subterranean termites often transport soil into bait stations. In this study , we hypothesize that adding soil or clay material in the bait may affect preference and performance of termites. Choice and no-choice tests were conducted in the laboratory to investigate the aggregation and<symptom> feeding<symptom> preference , survivorship , wood consumption , and body water percentage of termites in response to food containers ( here we simulated the bait station by placing a wood block into a bigger plastic box with termite-entering holes on the wall) with the void space filled with soil ( sandy clay loam) , clay material ( sodium bentonite) , or remained unfilled. Choice tests showed that under low-moisture conditions , food containers filled with clay attracted significantly more termites ( Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki ( Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) and Reticulitermes guangzhouensis Ping ( Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae)) compared to food containers filled with soil , or unfilled. Under medium-moisture conditions , however , the percentages of termites that aggregated in the food containers filled with soil or clay were similar , and both were significant higher than the percentages in unfilled ones. In no-choice tests , the highest survivorship and wood consumption in C. formosanus were recorded under medium-moisture conditions and when food containers were filled with clay , whereas the lowest survivorship and wood consumption were recorded under low-moisture conditions and when food containers were filled with soil. Interestingly , presence of clay increased the body water percentage of termites. Our study enhances the understanding of the foraging ecology of subterranean termites , and may contribute to the improvement of termite-baiting technologies.
