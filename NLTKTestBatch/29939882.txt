 Preterm infants born before 37 weeks ' gestation die of sudden infant death syndrome<symptom> ( SIDS) at a rate more than double that of term infants. There is a need for SIDS prevention programs tailored to the specific needs of parents of high-risk infants. The purpose of this study was to pilot test an online educational module addressing SIDS risk-reduction recommendations ( RRRs) for parents of preterm infants. This study was conducted in a 44-bed transitional care unit at a level IV NICU in the Midwest. A repeated-measures design was used. Two weeks before discharge , mothers completed a survey , addressing knowledge and plans for caring for their baby at home. Mothers then viewed the 5-section Caring about Preemies ' Safe Sleep ( CaPSS) education module and completed the postmodule evaluation. A discharge survey was completed 4 weeks postdischarge. Fifteen mothers , mean age 26.4 years , participated; 8 ( 53 %) returned the postdischarge survey. Module evaluation rated clarity and completeness of information high. Mothers ' ratings of SIDS knowledge were significantly higher after viewing the module ( P = .000) and 4 weeks after discharge home ( P = .012). Mothers found the use of a pacifier at sleep times to be new information and changed their plans for caring for their infant , with 28.6 % of mothers always offering a pacifier before sleep after discharge compared with the 6.7 % who had planned to do this before discharge. However , only 71 % of infants slept in parents ' room after discharge and only 41 % were receiving at least some breast milk , which are not consistent with SIDS RRRs.
