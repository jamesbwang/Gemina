 The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin ( hs-cTn) assays has improved the early assessment of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> patients. A number of hs-cTn-based algorithms and accelerated diagnostic protocols ( ADPs) have been developed and tested subsequently. In this review , we summarize the data on the performance and clinical utility of these strategies. We reviewed studies investigating the diagnostic and prognostic performance of hs-cTn algorithms ( level of detection ( LoD) strategy , 0/1-h , 0/2-h , and 0/3-h algorithms) and of hs-cTn-based ADPs , together with the implications of these strategies when implemented as clinical routine. The LoD strategy , when combined with a nonischemic electrocardiogram , is best suited for safe rule-out of myocardial infarction and the identification of patients eligible for early discharge from the emergency department. The 0/1-h algorithms appear to identify most patients as being eligible for rule-out. The hs-cTn-based ADPs mainly focus on prognostic assessment , which is in contrast with the hs-cTn algorithms. They identify smaller proportions of rule-out patients , but there is increasing evidence from prospective studies on their successful clinical implementation. Such information is currently lacking for hs-cTn algorithms. There is a trade-off between safety and efficacy for different hs-cTn-based strategies. This trade-off should be considered for the intended strategy , along with its user-friendliness and evidence from clinical implementation studies. However , several gaps in knowledge remain. At present , we suggest the use of an ADP in conjunction with serial hs-cTn results to optimize the early assessment of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> patients.
