 There is a growing interest in research aimed at better understanding the disease<disease> status<symptom> or predicting the prognosis of patients with simple blood tests associated with systemic inflammation. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) , lymphocyte-monocyte ratio ( LMR) , platelet-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR) , and mean platelet volume ( MPV) can be used as factors to determine the prognosis of patients in various clinical situations. However , reference values for these attributes based on large , healthy populations have yet to be determined.From January 2014 to December 2016 , data from routine blood analyses were collected from healthy patients in the checkup center of a tertiary hospital in Seoul , South Korea. Retrospective data review was then performed on an electronic medical record system. Data were treated anonymously as only age , sex , body mass index , medical history including cancer diagnosis , medications , and smoking status<symptom> were considered. After the initial screen , we had a collection of 12,160 samples from patients without any medical history , including cancer treatment. This patient pool consisted of 6268 ( 51.5 % , median age 47 years) and 5892 ( 48.5 % , median age 46 years) male and female patients , respectively. The mean NLR across all ages was 1.65 ( 0.79) , and the values for men and women were 1.63 ( 0.76) and 1.66 ( 0.82) , respectively. The mean LMR , PLR , and MPV were 5.31 ( 1.68) , 132.40 ( 43.68) , and 10.02 ( 0.79) , respectively. This study provides preliminary reference data on LMR , PLR , and MPV from different age and sex groups in South Korea. The results suggest that different cutoff values should be applied to the various patient populations.
