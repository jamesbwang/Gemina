 Indigenous cattle of India belong to the species , Bos indicus<pathogen> and they possess various adaptability and production traits. However , little is known about the genetic diversity and origin of these breeds. To investigate the status<symptom> , we sequenced and analyzed the whole mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) of seven Indian cattle breeds. In total , 49 single-nucleotide variants ( SNVs) were identified among the seven breeds analyzed. We observed a common synonymous SNV in the COII gene ( m. 7583G > A) of all the breeds studied. The phylogenetic analysis and genetic distance estimation showed the close genetic relationship among the Indian cattle breeds , whereas distinct genetic differences were observed between Bos indicus<pathogen> and Bos taurus cattle. Our results indicate a common ancestor for European Zwergzebu breed and South Indian<disease> cattle. The estimated divergence time demonstrated that the Bos indicus<pathogen> and Bos taurus cattle lineages diverged 0.92 million years ago. Our study also demonstrates that ancestors of present zebu breeds originated in South and North India separately âˆ¼ 30,000 to 20,000 years ago. In conclusion , the identified genetic variants and results of the phylogenetic analysis may provide baseline information to develop appropriate strategies for management and conservation of Indian cattle breeds.
