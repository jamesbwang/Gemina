 Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) is responsible for high-grade cervical<symptom> lesions<symptom> and cervical cancer. The inflammation<symptom> plays a key role in cervical cancer progression. In this context , studies propose an association between TNFα and IL10 SNPs and susceptibility to HPV<pathogen> infection. The present work aimed to investigate the possible association between IL10 and TNFα promoter polymorphisms and HPV<pathogen> infection in the cervical carcinogenesis risk in women from Brazil. A total of 654 samples was evaluated in this study. HPV<pathogen> detection was performed by PCR and HPV<pathogen> genotyping was performed by PCR and sequencing of positive MY09/11 PCR product. Genotyping of IL10 SNPs ( rs1800871 and rs1800896) was performed by High Resolution Melt analysis. Genotyping of TNFα SNP ( rs1800629) was performed by fluorogenic allele-specific probes. The distribution of TNF-308 ( rs1800629) allelic ( p = 0.03) and genotype ( p = 0.03) frequencies and HPV-58 infection has showed a statistically significant difference between case and control groups for the assessed TNFα polymorphism. When it comes to TNFα ( rs1800629) allelic and genotypic distribution and HPVs 18 and 31 infections , no statistically significant differences between case and control groups were observed for the studied TNFα polymorphism. The allelic and genotypic distribution of IL10-819 ( rs1800871) and IL10-1082 ( rs1800896) and HPV<pathogen> infection ( HPVs 58 , 18 and 31) has showed no statistically significant differences between case and control groups for the assessed IL10 polymorphisms. Furthermore , it was observed that haplotypes were associated with an increased cervical cancer risk in HPVs 16 , 18 and 58-positive women. It was observed that women carrying the GTA and ATG haplotypes had 3.85 and 17.99-fold , respectively , increased cervical cancer susceptibility when infected by HPV-58. In women infected with HPV-16 and HPV-18 , statistically significant results in women carrying the GTA and ATA haplotypes was observed. They had a 2.32 and 3.67-fold , respectively , increased cervical cancer susceptibility when infected by these two HPV<pathogen> types. The analysis of the haplotypes distribution in women infected with HPV-31 has showed no statistically significant results. Our study indicates that the association of genetic polymorphism in inflammation-related genes represents a risk to the susceptibility in the development of cervical cancer in women infected by HPVs 16 , 18 and 58.
