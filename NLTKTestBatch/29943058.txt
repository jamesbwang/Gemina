 One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass ( OAGB) has exponentially increased in the last decade , as it is associated with very low complications , mortality , readmissions and reoperations rates , and shows excellent short- and long-term benefits of weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and resolution of comorbidities. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of SG , RYGB , and OAGB , on short- and long-term weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and comorbidities resolution. A prospective randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG , RYGB , and OAGB , as primary bariatric procedures , was performed. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: those patients undergoing SG , those ones undergoing RYGB and those ones undergoing OAGB. BMI , excess BMI loss ( EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes ( T2DM) , hypertension ( HT) , and dyslipidemia ( DL) were assessed. 600 patients were included in the study , 200 in each group. Follow-up rate at 5 years postoperatively was 91 % in SG group , 92 % in RYGB , and 90 % in OAGB. OAGB achieves significantly greater EBMIL than RYGB and SG at 1 , 2 , and 5 years ( p < 0.001 , respectively). At 5 years , OAGB achieves significantly greater remission of T2DM ( p = 0.027) , HT ( p = 0.006) , and DL ( p < 0.001) than RYGB and SG. RYGB did not show significant superiority than SG in short- and long-term remission of T2DM and HT , but achieves greater remission of DL ( p < 0.001). OAGB achieves superior mid- and long-term weight<symptom> loss<symptom> than RYGB and SG. There are no significant differences in weight<symptom> loss<symptom> between SG and RYGB at 1 , 2 , and 5 years. OAGB achieves better short- and long-term resolution rates of DM , HT , and DL than SG and RYGB. RYGB and SG obtain similar T2DM and HT remissions , but RYGB reaches significantly greater rates of DL remission. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03467646.
