 Most treatments for epithelial injury target hematopoietic mechanisms , possibly causing immunosuppression. Interleukin ( IL) -22 promotes tissue regeneration , acting directly on epithelial cells. UTTR1147A , a human IL-22Fc ( IgG4) fusion protein , activates IL-22 signaling. This phase 1 placebo-controlled trial of single , ascending , intravenous ( IV; 1-120 μg/kg) and subcutaneous<disease> ( SC; 3-120 μg/kg) doses of UTTR1147A analyzed its effects on safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in healthy volunteers. Most adverse events ( AEs) were mild or moderate. The maximum tolerated IV dose in healthy volunteers was 90 μg/kg. Predominant AEs were dose-dependent skin effects consistent with IL-22 pharmacology. UTTR1147A exposure increased approximately dose-proportionally , with a half-life of approximately 1 week. IL-22 biomarkers ( regenerating islet protein 3A ( REG3A) , serum amyloid A ( SAA) , and C-reactive protein ( CRP)) increased dose-dependently. Neither inflammatory symptoms<symptom> and signs nor cytokines increased with CRP elevations. UTTR1147A demonstrated acceptable safety , pharmacokinetics , and IL-22R engagement , supporting further clinical development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
