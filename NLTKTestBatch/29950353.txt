 Infliximab ( IFX) has an established role in Crohn 's disease<disease> ( CD) , with serum trough levels of IFX ( TLI) increasingly used to optimise dosing. We report the utility of routine , proactive TLI in children on combination therapy with immunosuppression ( IS) from a single paediatric centre. This is a retrospective chart review of all children with CD receiving IFX therapy conducted betweenJanuary 2014-May 2017. Clinical phenotype , duration of therapy , TLI ( µg/mL) , drug antibodies , type of IS , biomarkers and changes<symptom> in management were recorded. 60 children ( 8-17 years; median 14.1 years) had 206 TLIs recorded. 56/60 ( 93 %) were on IS , with 5/60 ( 8 %) developing antidrug antibodies ( ADAs). 63/206 TLIs were recorded duringan episode of relapse ( median 3.0 µg/mL) vs 143/206 TLIs recorded in remission ( median 5.2 µg/mL). For children with TLI < 3 µg/mL , 31/63 ( 49 %) were in relapse vs 30/143 ( 21 %) in remission. For children with TLI > 7 µg/mL , 7/63 ( 11 %) were in relapse vs 46/143 ( 32 %) in remission. Change in management resulted from 43/206 ( 21 %) TLIs in 31/60 ( 52 %) children: 21 dose escalations , 12 de-escalations and 10 changed to adalimumab. Of 31 postinduction TLIs , 15/17 ( 88 %) children with TLI > 7 µg/mL achieved clinical and biochemical remission for the duration of therapy ( median 14 months) , while 4/5 ( 80 %) children with TLI < 3 µg/mL required early dose escalation. Combination therapy with thiopurines ( TP) ( median TLI 4.9 µg/mL) versus methotrexate ( MTX) ( median TLI 5.2 µg/mL) achieved comparable levels with no difference in relapse frequency. Routine , proactive TLIs guide optimal management in children with CD. Postinduction and during maintenance , levels < 3 µg/mL were associated with relapse and levels > 7 µg/mL with sustained remission. Combination IS with TP and MTX appears to offer comparable TLI and ADA rates.
