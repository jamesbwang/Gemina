 Complexes bearing protic N-heterocyclic carbenes ( protic NHCs , pNHCs) , defined as cyclic carbenes stabilized by two heteroatoms including at least one NH group , have been less explored in comparison to the conventional N , N '- disubstituted NHCs. The small and reactive NH group of the pNHCs differentiates this class of compounds from the classical NR,NR-NHCs with regard to their properties and reactivity. While the free pNHCs have so far eluded isolation due to isomerization to the azole tautomer , a significant number of transition-metal pNHC complexes have by now been prepared by a variety of methods. This article reviews the coordination<symptom> chemistry of the pNHCs. Synthetic approaches toward complexes of pNHCs are first described , followed by a discussion of the properties and reactivity of pNHC complexes with emphasis on the Br√∏nsted-acidic nature of the NH wingtip. Involvement of the pNHC ligands in catalytically active intermediates and in cooperative catalysis is also discussed.
