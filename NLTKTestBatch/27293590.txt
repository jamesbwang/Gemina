 Baleen whales have few identifiable external indicators of pregnancy state , making it challenging to study essential aspects of their biology and population dynamics. Pregnancy status<symptom> in other marine mammals has been determined by measuring progesterone concentrations from a variety of sample matrices , but logistical constraints have limited such studies in free-swimming baleen whales. We use an extensive blubber sample archive and associated calving history data to retrospectively identify samples that correspond to pregnant females and develop a progesterone-based pregnancy test for humpback whales. The lowest pregnant blubber progesterone concentration was 54.97 ng g
