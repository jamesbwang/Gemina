 The incidence of overuse injury to the elbow among baseball pitchers continues to rise , despite extensive efforts at pitch count regulations and emphasis on proper throwing mechanics. To determine if the medial elbow experiences increased torque levels as a baseball pitcher fatigues<symptom> through the course of a simulated game. Descriptive laboratory study. High school and collegiate baseball pitchers were recruited for this simulated game study. Each pitcher completed a simulated game consisting of 6 innings and a standardized pitching scheme of fastballs , curveballs , and changeups. In total , each pitcher threw 90 pitches. Fatigue<symptom> was reported per inning with a visual analog scale , and pitch velocity was captured per pitch with a radar gun. Outcome measures were assessed with a validated mobile sensor and included medial elbow torque , arm speed , arm rotation , and arm slot. Linear and quadratic regression modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between pitcher fatigue<symptom> and pitching kinematics. A total of 11 pitchers ( mean age , 17.6 years; range , 15-20 years) completed the study. Visual analog scale fatigue<symptom> scores increased 0.72 points per inning pitched ( P < .01 , effect size = 0.64). Medial elbow torque also increased beyond inning 3 , with an increase of 0.84 N · m each inning ( P < .01 , effect size = 0.08) , while pitch velocity decreased ( 0.28 mph per inning , P < .01 , effect size = 0.27). Fastballs generated the greatest amount of medial elbow torque ( 49.3 ± 1.4 N · m , P < .01 , effect size = 0.24). There were no differences in arm rotation ( P = .42) or arm speed ( P = .80) as the game progressed. However , arm slot decreased with each successive inning ( 0.73 ° on average per inning , P = .03 , effect size = 0.12). No adverse outcomes were noted with use of the mobile sensor. In this simulated game analysis , pitchers experienced increased fatigue<symptom> after each successive inning. While the average pitch velocity declined with each successive inning , the torque on the medial elbow increased after inning 3. These findings signify a possible relationship between fatigue<symptom> and injury risk.
