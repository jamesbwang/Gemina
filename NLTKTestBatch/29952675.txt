 While the acute effects of cold water immersion ( CWI) have been widely investigated , research analysing the effects of CWI over a chronic period in highly-trained athletes is scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CWI during an intense three week pre-season phase in elite rugby athletes. Twenty-three elite male rugby union athletes were randomized to either CWI ( 10 min at 10 ÂºC , n = 10) or a passive recovery control ( CON , n = 12) during three-weeks of high volume training. Athletes were exposed to either CWI or CON , after each training day ( 12 days in total). Running loads , conditioning and gym sessions were kept the same between groups. Measures of countermovement jump ( CMJ) , perceived muscle<symptom> soreness<symptom> and wellness were obtained twice a week , and saliva samples for determining cortisol and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) were collected once per week. Although no significant differences were observed between CWI and CON for any measure , CWI resulted in lower fatigue<symptom> markers throughout the study , as demonstrated by the moderate effects on muscle<symptom> soreness<symptom> ( d = 0.58 to 0.91) and IL-6 ( d = -0.83) , and the small effects ( d = 0.23 to 0.38) on CMJ in comparison to CON. The results from this study demonstrate that CWI may provide some beneficial effect by reducing fatigue<symptom> and soreness<symptom> during an intense three week training phase in elite rugby athletes.
