 Checkpoint inhibitors ( CPIs) restore the function of effector immunocytes to target and destroy cancer cells. Immune-related adverse events ( irAEs) are a consequence of immune reactivation , with unpredictable inflammatory response , loss of self-tolerance , and development of autoimmunity. Adverse events from CPIs that present as dermatologic toxicities have diverse clinical and histopathologic features. CPI-associated dermatologic toxicities may exhibit histopathologic features of lichenoid dermatitis<disease> , bullous pemphigoid , and granulomatous/sarcoid-like reactions. Suprabasal acantholytic dermatologic toxicities associated with CPIs are particularly rare but represent an emerging histopathologic pattern and include lichenoid dermatitis<disease> with suprabasal acantholysis/vesicle formation to Grover disease<disease> ( transient acantholytic dermatosis). Here , we report two patients who developed suprabasal acantholytic dermatologic toxicities during CPI therapy. One patient exhibited a CPI-associated autoimmune blistering disease<disease> with PNP-like features restricted to histopathology and immunofluorescence , while the other patient had Grover-like lesions<symptom>. A review of the literature revealed a spectrum of suprabasal acantholytic dermatologic toxicities associated CPIs that may present as lichenoid dermatitis<disease> with acantholysis/vesicle formation , Grover-like eruptions , and lesions<symptom> with PNP-like features restricted to histopathology and immunofluorescence. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the types of dermatologic toxicities associated with CPIs to direct appropriate therapeutic strategies.
