 The healthy vestibulo-ocular reflex ( VOR) ensures that images remain on the fovea of the retina during head<disease> rotation in order to maintain stable vision. VOR behavior can be measured as a summation of linear and non-linear properties though it is unknown whether asymmetric VOR adaptation can be performed synchronously in humans. The purpose of the present study is twofold. First , examine whether the right<symptom> and left VOR gains can be synchronously adapted in opposing directions. Second , to investigate whether the adaptation context transfers between both sides. Three separate VOR adaptation sessions were randomized such that the VOR was adapted Up-bilaterally; Down-bilaterally; or Mixed ( one side up , opposite side down). Ten healthy subjects completed the study. Subjects were tested while seated upright , 1-meter in front of a wall in complete dark. Each subject made active ( self-generated) head<disease> impulse rotations for 15 min while viewing a gradually increasing amount of retinal slip. VOR training demand changed by 10 % every 90 seconds. The VOR changed significantly for all training conditions. No significant differences in the magnitude of VOR gain changes between training conditions were found. The human VOR can be simultaneously driven in opposite directions. The similar magnitude of VOR gain changes across training conditions suggests functionally independent VOR circuits for each side of head<disease> rotation , that mediate simultaneous and opposing VOR adaptations.
