 Abnormalities of MITO dynamics occur in HF and have been implicated in disease<disease> progression. This study describes the broad range abnormalities of mitochondrial ( MITO) dynamics in Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HF) and evaluates the effects of long-term therapy with elamipretide ( ELAM) , a MITO-targeting peptide , on these abnormalities. Studies were performed in left ventricular tissue from dogs and humans with HF , and were compared with tissue from healthy dogs and healthy donor human hearts<symptom>. Dogs with HF were randomized to 3 months therapy with ELAM or vehicle. The following were evaluated in dog and human hearts<symptom>: ( 1) regulators of MITO biogenesis , including endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS) , cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP) , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α ( PGC-1α , a transcription factor that drives MITO biogenesis); ( 2) regulators of MITO fission and fusion , including fission-1 , dynamin-related protein-1 , mitofusion-2 , dominant optic atrophy-1 , and mitofilin; and ( 3) determinants of cardiolipin ( CL) synthesis and remodeling , including CL synthase-1 , tafazzin-1 , and acyl-CoA: lysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1. The study showed decreased levels of eNOS , cGMP , and PGC-1α in HF ( dog and human). Increased levels of fission-associated proteins , decreased levels of fusion-associated proteins , decreased mitofilin , and abnormalities of CL synthesis and remodeling were also observed. In all instances , these maladaptations were normalized following long-term therapy with ELAM. Critical abnormalities of MITO dynamics occur in HF and are normalized following long-term therapy with ELAM. The findings provide support for the continued development of ELAM for the treatment of HF.
