 There has been little research on the direct and indirect connections between student loan debt and health. The present study tested a transactional stress model ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984a) of student loan debt in which the appraisal of debt as stressful was proposed to mediate the associations between student loan debt amount and perceived health ( i.e. , self-rated general health , depressive symptomatology). The present study draws on a racially/ethnically diverse college student sample ( SEM results indicated good fit of the transactional stress model and suggested its superiority to the alternative two-factor model. Multigroup SEM analyses revealed racial/ethnic differences. Whereas for Black/African Americans , Hispanic/Latino Americans , and White<symptom> Americans , appraisal of debt as stressful was linked to poorer general health and more depressive symptomatology , these associations were nonsignificant for Asian Americans. Tests of indirect effects indicated that the mediating role of debt stress was most consistently significant for Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans compared with Asian and , to a lesser extent , White<symptom> Americans. Results affirm the potential health impact of both student loan debt amount and the subjective appraisal of stress associated with student loan debt as significant stressors.
