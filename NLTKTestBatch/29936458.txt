 Natural killer ( NK) cells are one of the lymphocytes clinically used for various cancer types. Cytotoxicity of NK cells to cholangiocarcinoma ( CC) , however , has not yet been studied. Nor NK cell therapy against CC has been clinically applied. In this study , relevance of NK cell therapy for anti-tumor efficacy against CC was pre-clinically investigated. Human HuCCT-1 cells , an intrahepatic CC cell line , were xenografted into nude mice. The HuCCT-1 tumor-bearing nude mice then received multiple infusions of ex vivo-expanded human NK cells ( SMT01) and in vivo cytotoxic activity of the NK cells against the CC cells was evaluated. SMT01 infusion resulted in significant inhibition of the CC tumor growth. Body<symptom> weight<symptom> of the mice administrated with chemotherapy was found to be maintained at the lowest level among all treatment groups while all the SMT01 infusion groups well maintained their body<symptom> weight<symptom>. The present in vivo study demonstrates that NK cells contain cytolytic activity against cholangiocarcinoma and show beneficial effect of NK cell therapy in relevance to quality of life. Further investigation of the NK cell-based immunotherapy can be useful to determine cancer therapeutics for the specific tumor.
