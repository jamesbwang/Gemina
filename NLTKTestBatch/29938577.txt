 Cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) lung<disease> infection<disease> is a complex condition where opportunistic pathogens and defective immune system cooperate in developing a constant cycle of infection and inflammation<symptom>. The major pathogen , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , secretes a multitude of virulence factors involved in host immune response and lung tissue damage. In this study , we examined the possible anti-inflammatory effects of molecules inhibiting P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> virulence factors. Pyocyanin , pyoverdine and proteases were measured in bacterial culture supernatant from different P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> strains. Inhibition of virulence factors by sub-inhibitory concentrations of clarithromycin and by protease inhibitors was evaluated. Lung inflammatory response was monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging in wild-type and CFTR-knockout mice expressing a luciferase gene under the control of a bovine IL-8 promoter. The amount of proteases , pyocyanin and pyoverdine secreted by P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> strains was reduced after growth in the presence of a sub-inhibitory dose of clarithromycin. Intratracheal challenge with culture supernatant containing bacteria-released products induced a strong IL-8-mediated response in mouse lungs while lack of virulence factors corresponded to a reduction in bioluminescence emission. Particularly , sole inactivation of proteases by inhibitors Ilomastat and Marimastat also resulted in decreased lung inflammation<symptom>. Our data support the assumption that virulence factors are involved in P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> pro-inflammatory action in CF lungs; particularly , proteases seem to play an important role. Inhibition of virulence factors production and activity resulted in decreased lung inflammation<symptom>; thus , clarithromycin and protease inhibitors potentially represent additional therapeutic therapies for P. aeruginosa-infected patients.
