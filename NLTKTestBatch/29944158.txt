 Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> of unknown etiology , characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas<disease> in several organs; renal impairment alone is a rare condition. When it affects the kidneys , the most prevalent manifestations are hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. This paper aims to address the topic of renal sarcoidosis , by means of a case report , and reinstate the importance of histopathology in its diagnosis. The data came from an observational clinical study with a qualitative approach , through an interview with the renal sarcoidosis patient and data from her medical records. Patient D.M.S. , 50 years old , Caucasian , presented with reddish eyes and body<symptom> pains<symptom> lasting for fifteen days as first manifestations of the disease<disease>. Upon kidney ultrasound scan , we found renal parenchymal nephropathy. Serial renal function and metabolic tests reported anemia<symptom> and progressive urea and creatinine changes , as well as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria , confirming acute kidney failure ( AKF). A histopathological examination suggested the diagnosis , which was confirmed by clinical , laboratory and histopathological data. There was therapeutic resolution after steroid therapy. The symptomatology of sarcoidosis is diverse and often non-specific. Renal manifestation , which usually occurs after organ involvement , is present in less than 5 % of patients , and about 1 % to 2 % of these patients may develop AKF. The use of histopathology together with clinical and laboratory data to diagnose isolated renal sarcoidosis , rule out other etiologies and introduce early treatment is of paramount importance.
