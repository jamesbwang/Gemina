 Age-related musculoskeletal diseases<disease> are becoming increasingly burdensome in terms of both individual quality of life and medical cost. We intended to establish a large population-based cohort study to determine environmental , lifestyle , and genetic risk factors of musculoskeletal and other age-related diseases<disease> , and to clarify the association between vitamin D status<symptom> and such diseases<disease>. We targeted 34,802 residents aged 40-74 years living in areas of northern Niigata Prefecture , including Sekikawa Village , Awashimaura Village , and Murakami City ( Murakami region). The baseline questionnaire survey , conducted between 2011 and 2013 , queried respondents on their lifestyle and environmental factors ( predictors) , and self-reported outcomes. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D) concentration , an indicator of vitamin D status<symptom> , was determined with the Liaison Â® 25OH Vitamin D Total Assay. The primary outcome of this study was osteoporotic fracture; other outcomes included age-related diseases<disease> including knee osteoarthritis , perception of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , dementia , and long-term care insurance use. Mean ages of men and women were 59.2 ( SD = 9.3 , N = 6907) and 59.0 ( SD = 9.3 , N = 7457) years , respectively. From the blood samples provided by 3710 men and 4787 women , mean 25 ( OH) D concentrations were 56.5 ( SD = 18.4) nmol/L ( 22.6 ng/mL) and 45.4 ( SD = 16.5) nmol/L ( 18.2 ng/mL) , respectively. Follow-up surveys are planned every 5 years for 15 years , and incident cases of our targeted diseases<disease> will be followed at hospitals and clinics in and nearby the cohort area. We anticipate that we will be able to clarify the association between vitamin D status<symptom> and multiple disease<disease> outcomes in a Japanese population.
