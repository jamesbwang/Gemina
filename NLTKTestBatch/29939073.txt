 Recently , the use of transcutaneous bone conduction implants ( BCIs) has been increased. However , scarce data about BCI hearing recovery in noise conditions have been reported. To investigate the audiological benefits obtained with transcutaneous BCI-Sophono Alpha System in noise conditions. To evaluate post-implantation clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction levels. Fourteen patients suffering from conductive or mixed hearing loss implanted with the Sophono Alpha System were evaluated. Patients underwent physical examination , free-field pure-tone and<symptom> speech<symptom> audiometry both in unaided and aided conditions. The matrix sentence test was employed with fixed noise at 65 dB , and with a fluctuating primary signal , in three different conditions of noise presentations ( S0/N0 , S0/Ncontra , S0/Nipsi). Hearing gain , expressed as the difference between pre-implant AC and post-implant SAS free field , was on average 26.7 dB. The unaided speech recognition score in quiet conditions had a mean value of 64.6 % , and improved after SAS implantation , achieving mean values of 98.2 %. SRT Sophono Alpha System devices represent a valid treatment option for hearing rehabilitation of patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss. The audiological results regarding hearing gain in noise conditions were good.
