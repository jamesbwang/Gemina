 In recent years , empirical studies have shown that the inability to tolerate distress is associated with a wide range of negative outcomes including eating addiction , drug abuse , alcohol use , and antisocial behavior in adults. However , few studies have examined family correlates of this ability in children. Also , past literature on child emotional competencies has mainly focused on documenting the linkages between mother and child and has neglected the role of fathers. Children ( N = 54 , M age = 10.15 years , SD = 1.02; 55.6 % males) and their parents participated. Parents reported on their emotion regulation strategies and children reported on their depressive symptoms<symptom>. Distress tolerance ( DT) was assessed using the computerized distress tolerance task , the Behavioral Indicator of Resiliency to Distress. Children who were able to complete the BIRD had lower levels of depression<symptom>. Analyses examining relations among father and mother emotion regulation and children 's DT showed children 's DT is more closely related to their mothers ' than fathers ' emotion regulation styles. These findings suggest that DT is an important construct in understanding children 's psychopathology , but also that maternal emotion regulation is associated with children 's distress tolerance.
