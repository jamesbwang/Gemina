 The biodegradation of polyhydroxybutyrate ( PHB) has been broadly investigated , but studies typically focus on a single strain or enzyme and little attention has been paid to comparing the interaction of different PHB depolymerase ( PhaZ)- producing strains with this biopolymer. In this work , we selected nine bacterial strains-five with demonstrated and four with predicted PhaZ activity-to compare their effectiveness at degrading PHB film provided as sole carbon source. Each of the strains with demonstrated activity were able to use the PHB film ( maximum mass losses<symptom> ranging from 12 % after 2 days for Paucimonas lemoignei to 90 % after 4 days for Cupriavidus<pathogen> sp.) , and to a lower extent Marinobacter algicola DG893 ( with a predicted PhaZ) achieved PHB film mass loss of 11 % after 2 weeks of exposure. Among the strains with proven PhaZ activity , Ralstonia<pathogen> sp. showed the highest specific activity since less biomass was required to degrade the polymer in comparison to the other strains. In the case of Ralstonia<pathogen> sp. , PHB continued to be degraded at pH values as low as pH 3.3-3.7. In addition , analysis of the extracellular fractions of the strains with demonstrated activity showed that Comamonas<pathogen> testosteroni<pathogen> , Cupriavidus<pathogen> sp. , and Ralstonia<pathogen> sp. readily degraded both PHB film and PHB particles in agar suspensions. This study highlights that whole cell cultures and enzymatic ( extracellular) fractions display different levels of activity , an important factor in the development of PHB-based applications and in understanding the fate of PHB and other PHAs released in the environment. Furthermore , predictions of PhaZ functionality from genome sequencing analyses remain to be validated by experimental results; PHB-degrading ability could not be proven for three of four investigated species predicted by the polyhydroxyalkanoates ( PHA) depolymerase engineering database.
