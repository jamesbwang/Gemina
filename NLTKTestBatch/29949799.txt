 <br> Objective: Autosomal dominant familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( adFNDI) is characterized by severe polyuria and polydipsia and is caused by variations in the gene encoding the AVP prohormone. The study aimed to ascertain a correct diagnosis , to identify the underlying genetic cause of adFNDI in a Swedish kindred , and to test the hypothesis that the identified synonymous exonic variant in the AVP gene ( c. 324G > A) , causes missplicing , and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) retention<symptom> of the prohormone. Three affected family members were admitted for fluid deprivation test and dDAVP challenge test. Direct sequencing of the AVP gene was performed in affected subjects , and genotyping of the identified variant was performed in family members. The variant was examined by expression of AVP minigenes containing the entire coding regions as well as intron 2 of AVP. Clinical tests revealed significant phenotypical variation with both complete and partial adFNDI phenotype. DNA analysis revealed a synonymous c. 324G > A substitution in one allele of the AVP gene in affected family members only. Cellular studies revealed both normally spliced and misspliced pre-mRNA in cells transfected with the AVP c. 324G > A minigene. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed collective localization of the variant prohormone to ER and vesicular structures at the tip of cellular processes. We have identified a synonymous variant affecting the second nucleotide of exon 3 in the AVP gene ( c. 324G > A) in a kindred in which adFNDI segregates. Notably , we showed that this variant causes partial missplicing of pre-mRNA resulting in accumulation of variant prohormone in ER. Our study suggests that even a small amount of aberrant mRNA might be sufficient to disturb cellular function resulting in adFNDI. <br>.
