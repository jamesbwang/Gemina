 Schwannomas are benign tumors derived from Schwann cells. However , schwannomas in the soft palate is considered rare. We report a case of a 17-year-old girl who presented with a 20-mm nodular lesion<symptom> in the soft palate. After surgical resection , a buccinator musculomucosal flap was used for soft palate reconstruction. At 6 months post-operation , velopharyngeal insufficiency was not observed. In this report , palatal muscles are examined , and the necessity of palatal muscle preservation and reconstruction of the defect in the soft palate mucosa after surgical resection of a schwannoma in the soft palate is presented. Following resection of an approximately 20 Ã— 19-mm-sized schwannoma of the soft palate , which is a relatively rare site of occurrence for schwannomas , we performed reconstruction of the defect using a BMMF to prevent scar contracture. This was an effective method of reconstruction in consideration of velopharyngeal function.
