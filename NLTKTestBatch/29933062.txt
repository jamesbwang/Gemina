 Rutin , a strong antioxidant , has been implicated in the prevention of liver inflammation<symptom>. However , low solubility and permeability through the gut wall limit development of rutin as a therapeutic agent for oral administration. Phytosomes are described as lipid nanocarriers with a complexation between the phospholipid headgroups and entrapped phytochemicals. The aim of this research was to compare the structure of rutin liposomes to rutin phytosomes. FT-IR , DSC and NMR were employed to investigate the presence of any molecular interactions between the formulation components. The FT-IR spectra showed that a new- OH bond had formed in the rutin phytosomes , suggesting the formation of a molecular complex.
