 To explore the value of a novel sensory criterion , the ulnar ratio- defined as the SNAP amplitude of the palmar cutaneous ( pUN) over that of the dorsal branch ( dUN) of the ulnar nerve- as a predictor of Acute<symptom> Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy ( AIDP). We prospectively included 22 patients with AIDP , 20 patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN) , and 18 controls. Eligible subjects underwent nerve conduction studies including , among others , the dUN , pUN , and sural nerve. A sural sparing pattern was found in 72 % of AIDP cases. The ulnar ratio was significantly lower in patients with AIDP compared to those with DPN or controls. The ROC curve area to discriminate AIDP ( versus controls and diabetics together) was higher with the ulnar ratio and pUN compared to dUN. An ulnar ratio â‰¥ 0.78 seems to be the best threshold to rule out the diagnosis of AIDP , with a specificity of 100 % and a sensitivity of 87 %. The ulnar ratio was equally reliable in the subgroup of patients presenting within a week of symptoms<symptom> onset. The ulnar ratio is a highly sensitive and specific marker of AIDP and can help confirm the diagnosis when direct signs of demyelination are lacking. Incorporating specific sensory abnormalities , such as the ulnar ratio , in the electrodiagnostic criteria of AIDP could enhance their reliability.
