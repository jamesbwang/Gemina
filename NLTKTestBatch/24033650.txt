 This study is designed to determine the feasibility of the provision of an evidenced-based aphasia<symptom> therapy , constraint-induced language therapy , via telerehabilitation. It describes the computer software that was developed specifically for the delivery of constraint-induced language therapy in the online environment and presents two case studies. Two participants with chronic aphasia<symptom> were assessed before and after a two-week intensive treatment block of constraint-induced language therapy delivered via Web-based videoconferencing. The group-based , dual card request game utilized in face-to-face constraint-induced language therapy was transformed into an innovative and user-friendly Web-based game- Internet constraint-induced language therapy ( iCILT). Participants accessed iCILT via the Internet from their own home every weekday for two weeks. Language and quality of life measures were administered pre- and post-therapy in order to detect treatment effects. Participant satisfaction information was also recorded. Online delivery of iCILT was technically feasible and participant satisfaction was high with a number of benefits associated with telerehabilitation identified by participants. Post-treatment performance for language functioning and communication-related quality of life was variable for each participant , however improvements in naming were noted. Constraint-induced language therapy delivered via telerehabilitation may be a feasible alternative to traditional face-to-face therapy for people with chronic aphasia<symptom>.
