 The aim of the study was to assess the patterns of development of metachronous cancer ( endometrial cancer , EC , and ovarian cancer , OC) in breast cancer ( BC) patients dependent of receptor phenotype of breast tumors. In the study , 63 patients with ะะก , who developed metachronous EC ( n = 47) or OC ( n = 16) were enrolled. Expression of estrogen receptor ( ER) , progesterone receptor ( PR) , HER/2neu was assessed using immunohistochemical approach. BC in patients with metachronous EC and OC was characterized by a different frequency of molecular subtypes with the dominance of luminal A ( 36 %) and B ( 43 %) subtypes. In primary BC , we have established a correlation between ER expression and regional lymph nodes status<symptom> ( r = -0.50 , p < 0.05); negative correlation between HER2/neu expression and tumor stage ( r = -0.48 , p < 0.05); between the molecular subtype of BC and its size ( r = -0.33 , p < 0.05) , the molecular subtype of primary BC and metastases in regional lymph nodes ( r = 0.27 , p < 0.05). In the patients with luminal subtype BC metachronous tumors developed with the highest frequency ( OC- 50 % , EC- 50 %). After treatment of primary BC metachronous tumors developed at different period: EC ( 22.2 %)- most often in 3-5 years , OC ( 11.0 %)- after 10 years and more. Our data evidence on the clinical significance of the individual characteristics of the BC , especially its molecular subtype , and the need to calculate the personalized risk of development of metachronous tumors of the reproductive system in patients with the BC.
