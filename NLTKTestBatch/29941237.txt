 Important advances have been made since the last Mexican consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> ( H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen>) infection was published in 2007. Therefore , the Asociación Mexicana de Gastroenterología summoned 20 experts to produce `` The Fourth Mexican Consensus on Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> ''. From February to June 2017 , 4 working groups were organized , a literature review was performed , and 3 voting rounds were carried out , resulting in the formulation of 32 statements for discussion and consensus. From the ensuing recommendations , it was striking that Mexico is a country with an intermediate-to-low risk for gastric cancer , despite having a high prevalence of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection. It was also corroborated that peptic ulcer<disease><symptom> disease<disease> , premalignant lesions<symptom> , and histories of gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma should be considered clear indications for eradication. The relation of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> to dyspeptic symptoms<symptom> continues to be controversial. Eradication triple therapy with amoxicillin , clarithromycin , and a proton pump inhibitor should no longer be considered first-line treatment , with the following 2 options proposed to take its place: quadruple therapy with bismuth ( proton pump inhibitor , bismuth subcitrate , tetracycline , and metronidazole) and quadruple therapy without bismuth ( proton pump inhibitor , amoxicillin , clarithromycin , and metronidazole). The need for antimicrobial sensitivity testing when 2 eradication treatments have failed was also established. Finally , the promotion of educational campaigns on the diagnosis and treatment of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> for both primary care physicians and the general population were proposed.
