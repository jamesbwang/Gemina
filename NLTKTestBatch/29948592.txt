 The benefit of optical coherence tomography ( OCT) guidance in percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) is unclear. We aimed to assess the incremental value of adding OCT to coronary angiography in PCI by meta-analytic technique. We searched PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane , Scopus and relevant references for randomized studies ( inception through January 5 , 2018 without language restrictions) and performed meta-analysis using random effects model. Major adverse cardiac events ( MACE) , all-cause mortality , myocardial infarction , target vessel revascularization , stent thrombosis , fluoroscopic time , contrast volume , and procedural side effects were the measured outcomes. Five randomized studies with a total population of 931 were analyzed. There was no difference in MACE between angiography plus OCT and angiography alone arms<symptom> ( 2.5 vs. 2.0 % OR 1.26; 95 % CI 0.40-3.99; P = 0.69; I
