 In this study , we aimed to identify whether tumor budding is associated with the progression and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC) and investigate the correlation between tumor budding and regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT). Fifty-six cases of OSCC were selected and their tumor budding status<symptom> was reviewed using archived hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. In addition , the expression of EMT regulators was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against Snail and Twist. Tumor budding was observed in 19 of the 56 cases of OSCC ( 33.9 %). Tumor budding was strongly associated with lymph node metastasis ( P = .001) and shorter overall survival ( P = .002). The expression of Snail and Twist was correlated with lymph node metastasis ( P < .001 and 0.002 , respectively) and poorer overall survival ( P = .024 and 0.024 , respectively). Tumor budding was significantly associated with the expression of Snail ( P = .003) and showed a tendency toward higher expression of Twist ( P = .08). Therefore , our results suggest that tumor budding is significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with OSCC and histologically represents an EMT process in OSCC.
