 Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD) are often used for benign and Sm1 large non-pedunculated rectal polyps ( LNPRPs) , although other surgical techniques including transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEMS) and transanal minimal invasive surgery remain available. This review covers the role of pre-excisional imaging and selective biopsy of LNPRPs. Areas covered: Polyps between 2 and 3 cm with favorable features ( Paris 1 , Kudo III/IV pit patterns , and non-lateral spreading type ( LST)) may have a one-stage EMR without biopsy and imaging , provided adequate expertise is available with other technologies such as magnifying chromoendoscopy. Higher-risk polyps ( moderate/severe dysplasia , 0-IIa + c morphology , nongranular LST , Kudo pit pattern V or submucosal carcinoma , or those > 3 cm) should have pre-EMR/ESD imaging with magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and/or endorectal ultrasound ( ERUS) Â± biopsies and photographs prior to multidisciplinary team discussion. Expert commentary: In some centers , EMR and ESD are considered the primary modality of treatment , with TEMS as a back-up , while elsewhere , TEMS is the main modality for excision of significant polyps and early colorectal cancer lesions<symptom>. Likewise , the exact roles of ERUS and MRI will depend on availability of local expertise , although it is suggested that the techniques are complementary.
