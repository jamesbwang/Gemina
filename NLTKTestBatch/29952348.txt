 Sudden infant death syndrome<symptom> mainly occurs during night-time sleep. Approximately 10 % of cases are thought to involve infants with long QT syndrome<symptom> ( LQTS). Autonomic function and QT interval in night-time sleep in early infancy in LQTS infants , however , remain controversial.Methods and Results: Holter electrocardiography was performed in 11 LQTS infants before medication in early infancy , and in 11 age-matched control infants. Control infants were re-evaluated in late infancy. The power spectral density was calculated and parasympathetic activity and sympathovagal balance<symptom> were obtained. Electrocardiograms of a representative hour during night-time sleep , daytime sleep , and daytime activity , were chosen and QT/RR intervals were manually measured. LQTS infants had significantly lower parasympathetic activity and higher sympathovagal balance<symptom> during night-time sleep than control infants in early infancy. These autonomic conditions in early infancy were significantly depressed compared with late infancy. Corrected QT interval ( QTc) during night-time sleep ( 490 ± 20 ms) was significantly longer than that in daytime sleep ( 477 ± 21 ms , P = 0.04) or daytime activity ( 458 ± 18 ms , P = 0.003) in LQTS infants , and significantly longer than that during night-time sleep in controls. A combination of the longest QTc and autonomic imbalance during night-time sleep in early infancy may be responsible for development of life-threatening arrhythmia in LQTS infants. Critical cases should be included in future studies.
