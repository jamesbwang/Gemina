 Headache<symptom> is one of the most common symptoms<symptom> following delivery and the underlying cause may be benign or life threatening. Identification of the cause of headache<symptom> in the postpartum period can be challenging and relies on a comprehensive history and thorough examination , with particular focus on the presence or absence of neurological signs , which may suggest a more serious diagnosis ( Nelson-Piercy 2010). However , through clinical experience and research , we have noted that post-partum headache<symptom> is significantly under-recognised and treated ( Goldszmidt et al. 2005). To ensure a standardised approach to the management of patients presenting with postpartum headache<symptom> , we sought to introduce a diagnostic tool for postpartum headache<symptom>. This was a literature review combined with a postpartum headache<symptom> case example that occurred within our institution in 2015. Risk factors and potential clinical failures<symptom> from the case were noted and compared to the literature. Our case is a 28-year-old woman who developed a postpartum headache<symptom> following spontaneous vaginal delivery. Of note , the patient had an epidural inserted in labour for analgesia. Initially , systemic and neurological examinations were normal and the patient was discharged home with simple analgesics and a diagnosis of tension-type headache<symptom>. She represented with worsening headache<symptom> , pyrexia and signs of meningism. Lumbar puncture confirmed a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis<disease> caused by Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen>. She was treated with IV ceftriaxone and discharged home without any long-term sequelae. In an attempt to improve recognition of post-partum headache<symptom> , especially rare causes such as meningitis<disease> , NHS Tayside has chosen to adopt the PARTUM mneumonic ( Lim et al. 2014). Pressure ( blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia) Anaesthetic ( post-dural puncture headache<symptom>) Reversible ( vasoconstriction syndrome<symptom>) Thrombosis ( cerebral venous sinus thrombosis , ischaemic stroke) Use your brain ( there are so many other causes of headache<symptom>) Migraine ( Lim et al. 2014). PARTUM was first devised in 2014 as part of a research paper published by the Journal Practical Neurology ( Lim et al. 2014). The aim of the mnemonic is to allow the treating physician a basic list of postpartum headache<symptom> causes to use as a working diagnosis ( Lim et al. 2014). Research has shown that many postpartum headaches<symptom> go undiagnosed and as a result are poorly treated , often returning following discharge from secondary care ( Nelson-Piercy 2010). The hope is that the introduction of this adjuvant will allow clinicians to identify the cause of postpartum headaches<symptom> earlier and will allow life threatening diagnoses to be quickly excluded.
