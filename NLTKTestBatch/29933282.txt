 ( 1) To examine how age influences initial symptom<symptom> presentation following concussion; and ( 2) to determine whether specific symptom<symptom> profiles are associated with duration of postconcussion symptoms<symptom> , and whether they vary by age group. A total of 689 patients ( 20 % children 7-12 years of age , 69 % adolescents 13-18 years of age , and 11 % young adults 19-30 years of age) were seen and diagnosed with a concussion within 21 days after injury. Patients completed the Post-Concussion Symptom<symptom> Scale ( PCSS) and were followed until they no longer required care. Two specialty care sport concussion clinical practices. Overall PCSS score was obtained , as well as severity ratings from somatic , vestibular-ocular , cognitive , sleep , and emotional symptom<symptom> domains. We also calculated total symptom<symptom> duration time. No significant main effect of age , or age by sex associations were identified among the symptom<symptom> domains. Females endorsed a higher somatic symptom<symptom> severity rating than males ( 9.8 ± 6.7 vs 8.1 ± 6.7; P = 0.03). For patients between 7 and 12 years of age , higher somatic ( β-coefficient = 1.57 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.47-1.67) and cognitive ( β-coefficient = 2.50 , 95 % CI , 2.32-2.68) symptom<symptom> severities were associated with longer duration of concussion symptoms<symptom>. Among adolescents , longer total symptom<symptom> duration was associated with more severe somatic ( β-coefficient = 1.25 , 95 % CI , 0.34-2.15) and vestibular-ocular ( β-coefficient = 2.36 , 95 % CI , 1.49-3.23) symptoms<symptom>. Within 21 days after concussion , symptom-reporting behavior seems to be similar across the age spectrum , but the relationship between symptom<symptom> profiles and time to symptom<symptom> resolution varies by age. Although overall symptom<symptom> ratings are beneficial in determining clinical pathways , symptom<symptom> domain use may provide a beneficial method to determine individualized patient care that differs between children and adolescents after concussion.
