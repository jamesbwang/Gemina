 Determining HIV<pathogen> serostatus is crucial for linking HIV-infected patients to appropriate care , which might reduce their risk of subsequent morbidity and mortality. A recent South African study demonstrated a potentially harmful association between an unknown HIV<pathogen> serostatus and rehospitalisation. The impact of an unknown HIV<pathogen> status<symptom> on inpatient mortality has not yet been established in that setting , which formed the impetus for the current study. This was an unmatched case-control analysis of adult patient data collected as part of a demographic survey at the Hlabisa Hospital , South Africa between October 2009 and February 2014. Cases were defined as patients who suffered inpatient mortality , while controls were patients who did not suffer inpatient mortality. A sample size of 92 cases and 276 controls was used in this study. Patient data related to age , gender , distance between referral clinic and the hospital , HIV<pathogen> serostatus ( HIV-negative , HIV-positive or an unknown HIV<pathogen> serostatus) and comorbidity were analysed using recommended methods for unmatched case-control studies. When potential confounders were accounted for , we found an unknown HIV<pathogen> serostatus to be associated with an almost 8-fold increase in the odds of inpatient mortality when compared with patients who were known HIV-negative ( Odds Ratio: 7.64 , 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.11-52.33 , p = 0.038). An unknown HIV<pathogen> serostatus was independently associated with a higher odds of inpatient mortality. This finding highlights the potential benefit of adopting an `` opt-out '' approach to HIV<pathogen> counseling and testing. Further research on this topic is required.
