 The effect of genistein on Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression in the ovarian tissue of rats with polycystic ovarian syndrome<symptom> ( PCOS) was evaluated. Sixty rats were divided into six groups. Rats in the Dose group received genistein at a concentration of either 5 ( L-gen) , 10 ( M-Gen) or 20 ( H-Gen) mg per kg of body<symptom> weight per day. The expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and Bax mRNA was determined by in situ hybridization. Bcl-2 and Bax protein concentration was quantified by ELISA. The results showed that the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher in the high genistein Dose group ( H-Gen) when compared to the Model group ( MG) ( P < 0.05). Genistein induced higher expression of the Bcl-2 gene at the transcriptional and translational level. Treatment with genistein resulted in an improvement of ovarian function with Bcl-2 expression being enhanced and Bax expression being suppressed. These alterations may be due to the structural and functional modifications that take place in these cells , and could be related to apoptotic changes that occur in rats with PCOS.
