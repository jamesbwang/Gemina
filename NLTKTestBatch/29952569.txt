 Using time-domain density functional theory combined with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics , we demonstrate that both symmetrical ( GB_s) and asymmetrical grain boundaries ( GB_a) significantly extend charge-carrier lifetime compared with monolayer black phosphorus. Boundaries create no deep trap states , which decrease electron-phonon coupling. As a result , GB_s increases carrier lifetime by a factor of 22 , whereas GB_a extends the lifetime by a factor of 4. More importantly , the interplay between the immobile electron localized at the boundaries in the GB_s and extended excited-state lifetime facilitates a chemical reaction , which is beneficial for photocatalysts. In contrast , GB_a separates electron and hole spatially in different locations , which forms a long-lived charge-separated state and is favorable for photovoltaics. Our simulations demonstrate that grain boundaries are benign and retard nonradiative electron-hole recombination in monolayer black phosphorus , suggesting a route to reduce energy losses<symptom> via rational choice of defect to realize high-performance photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.
