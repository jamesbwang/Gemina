 A primary goal of this research project is to better understand how shared medical appointments ( SMAs) can improve the health status and decrease hospitalization and death for patients recently discharged with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) by providing education , disease<disease> state monitoring , medication titration , and social support to patients and their caregivers. We propose a 3-site randomized-controlled efficacy trial with mixed methods to test a SMA intervention , versus usual care. Patients within 12 weeks of a HF hospitalization will be randomized to receive either HF-SMA ( intervention arm) with optional co-participation with their caregivers , versus usual care ( control arm). The HF-SMA will be provided by a non-physician team composed of a nurse , a nutritionist , a health psychologist , a nurse practitioner and/or a clinical pharmacist and will consist of four sessions of 2-h duration that occur every other week for 8 weeks. Each session will start with an assessment of patient needs followed by theme-based disease<disease> self-management education , followed by patient-initiated disease<disease> management discussion , and conclude with break-out sessions of individualized disease<disease> monitoring and medication case management. The study duration will be 180 days for all patients from the day of randomization. The primary study hypothesis is that , compared with usual care , patients randomized to HF-SMA will experience better cardiac health status at 90 and 180 days follow-up. The secondary hypotheses are that , compared to usual care , patients randomized to HF-SMA will experience better overall health status , a combined endpoint of hospitalization and death , better HF self-care behavior , and lower B-type natriuretic peptide levels.
