 Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> E<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HEV<pathogen>) is an under-recognised aetiological factor of viral hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom>; it is most commonly transmitted via the oral-faecal route , but can also be transmitted by blood or blood products , vertically from an infected mother to the foetus or by transplanted organs. The aim of the study was to present the current seroprevalence of HEV<pathogen> among soldiers from the Polish Special Forces deployed on military operations carried out in harsh environmental conditions. The research conducted between October and November 2016 involved 253 active duty soldiers , 237 men and 16 women , aged 26-57 , without clinical symptoms<symptom> of infection , participants in military operations in Asia and Africa. Accurate HEV<pathogen> diagnosis required the implementation of a two-phase diagnostic protocol. During the first phase , immunoenzymatic ELISA method was used to detect specific anti-HEV antibodies ( IgM and IgG) in blood serum samples indicating contact with an infectious<disease> agent<disease> in the past. During the second phase , serum samples obtained from subjects with positive or inconclusive test results were tested again using confirmatory recomLine HEV<pathogen> IgM/IgG immunoassay. Immunoenzymatic assay found anti-HEV antibodies ( IgM and/or IgG) in blood serum samples obtained from 18 soldiers. Confirmatory tests were carried out among soldiers tested positive with ELISA or those with inconclusive test results; the confirmatory tests showed anti-HEV antibodies ( IgM and/or IgG) in 16 of the studied soldiers , i.e. 6.3 % of the study group. The occurrence of HEV<pathogen> infections in Polish soldiers justifies the need for the introduction of screening tests for HEV<pathogen> in the military environment , especially among blood donors and in cases of whole blood or blood products transfusion.
