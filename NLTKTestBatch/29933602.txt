 The chemical binding of photocatalytic materials , such as TiO ₂ and ZnO nanoparticles , onto porous polymer membranes<symptom> requires a series of chemical reactions and long purification processes , which often result in small amounts of trapped nanoparticles with reduced photocatalytic activity. In this work , a chemical vapor deposition technique was investigated in order to allow the nucleation and growth of ZnO and TiO ₂ nanoparticles onto polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF) porous membranes<symptom> for application in advanced oxidation processes. The thickness of obtained surface coatings by sputtered nanoparticles was found to depend on process conditions. The photocatalytic efficiency of sputtered membranes<symptom> was tested against both a model drug and a model organic pollutant in a small continuous flow reactor.
