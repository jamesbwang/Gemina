 Acute<symptom> pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> due to sympathetic surge and increased peripheral vascular resistance often present to the emergency department ( ED) with markedly elevated blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , severe<symptom> dyspnea<symptom> , and desaturation. This condition is known as `` SCAPE '' ( sympathetic crashing acute<symptom> pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom>). We present three SCAPE patients who were successfully treated with high-dose nitroglycerin ( NTG) and bilevel positive airway pressure ( BiPAP) ventilation. All three patients presented with respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> on arrival but rapidly improved after treatment and did not require endotracheal intubation or admission to the intensive care unit ( ICU). SCAPE patients usually present to the ED with extreme respiratory distress associated with diaphoresis , restlessness , and high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. Emergency physicians must know how to manage SCAPE with high-dose nitrates and NIPPV ( noninvasive positive pressure ventilation) because , when treated promptly , one will not only save a life but also obviate the need for endotracheal intubation and ICU admission.
