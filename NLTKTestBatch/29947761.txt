 There is now ample evidence that endosymbionts can contribute to host adaptation to environmental challenges. However , how endosymbiont presence affects the adaptive trajectory and outcome of the host is yet largely unexplored. In Drosophila , Wolbachia<pathogen> confers protection to RNA virus<pathogen> infection<disease> , an effect that differs between Wolbachia<pathogen> strains and can be targeted by selection. Adaptation to RNA virus<pathogen> infections<disease> is mediated by both Wolbachia and the host , raising the question of whether adaptive genetic changes in the host vary with the presence/absence of the endosymbiont. Here , we address this question using a polymorphic D. melanogaster population previously adapted to DCV infection<disease> for 35 generations in the presence of Wolbachia , from which we removed the endosymbiont and followed survival over the subsequent 20 generations of infection<disease>. After an initial severe drop , survival frequencies upon DCV selection increased significantly , as seen before in the presence of Wolbachia. Whole-genome sequencing , revealed that the major genes involved in the first selection experiment , pastrel and Ubc-E2H , continued to be selected in Wolbachia-free D. melanogaster , with the frequencies of protective alleles being closer to fixation in the absence of Wolbachia. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in Wolbachia infection<disease> status<symptom> may be sufficient to maintain polymorphisms even in the absence of costs.
