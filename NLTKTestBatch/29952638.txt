 Hypertension is an important health challenge that affects millions of people across the world and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease<disease>. It is critical that anesthesia providers have a working knowledge of the systemic implications of hypertension. This review article will discuss the medical definitions of hypertension , the physiology of maintaining blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , outpatient treatment of hypertension , anesthetic implications , and the common medications used by anesthesia providers in the treatment of hypertension. Part I will provide an overview of hypertension and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> regulation. In addition , drugs affecting predominantly renal control of hypertension , such as diuretics , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers , and renin-inhibiting agents , will be discussed.
