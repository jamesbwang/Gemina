 The 3 ` untranslated region ( UTR) in alphavirus<pathogen> genomes functions in virus<pathogen> replication and plays a role in determining virus<pathogen> host range. However , the molecular evolution of virus<pathogen> UTRs is understudied compared to the evolution of protein-coding regions. Chikungunya<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( CHIKV) has the longest 3 ` UTR among the alphaviruses<pathogen> ( 500-700 nt) , and 3 ` UTR length and sequence structure vary substantially among different CHIKV lineages. Previous studies showed that genomic deletions and insertions are key drivers of CHIKV 3 ` UTR evolution. Inspired by hypothesized deletion events in the evolutionary history of CHIKV , we used experimental evolution to examine CHIKV adaptation in response to a large 3 ` UTR deletion. We engineered a CHIKV mutant with a 258 nt deletion in the 3 ` UTR ( ΔDR1/2). This deletion reduced viral replication on mosquito cells , but did not reduce replication on mammalian cells. To examine how selective pressures<symptom> from vertebrate and invertebrate hosts shape CHIKV evolution after a deletion in the 3 ` UTR , we passaged ΔDR1/2 virus<pathogen> populations strictly on primate cells , strictly on mosquito cells , or with alternating primate/mosquito cell passages. We found that virus<pathogen> populations passaged on a single host cell line increased in fitness relative to the ancestral deletion mutant on their selected host , and viruses<pathogen> that were alternately passaged improved on both hosts. Surprisingly , whole genome sequencing revealed few changes in the 3 ` UTR of passaged populations. Rather , virus<pathogen> populations evolved improved fitness through mutations in protein coding regions that were associated with specific hosts.
