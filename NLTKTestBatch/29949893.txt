 Service recommendation has become an effective way to quickly extract insightful information from massive data. However , in the cloud environment , the quality of service ( QoS) data used to make recommendation decisions are often monitored by distributed sensors and stored in different cloud platforms. In this situation , integrating these distributed data ( monitored by remote sensors) across different platforms while guaranteeing user privacy is an important but challenging task , for the successful service recommendation in the cloud environment. Locality-Sensitive Hashing ( LSH) is a promising way to achieve the abovementioned data integration and privacy-preservation goals , while current LSH-based recommendation studies seldom consider the possible recommendation failures<symptom> and hence reduce the robustness of recommender systems significantly. In view of this challenge , we develop a new LSH variant , named converse LSH , and then suggest an exception handling approach for recommendation failures<symptom> based on the converse LSH technique. Finally , we conduct several simulated experiments based on the well-known dataset , i.e. , Movielens to prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
