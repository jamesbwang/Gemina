 An 83-year-old man presented to the dermatology department for an ulcerated skin<symptom> lesion<symptom> of the back that had been increasing in size during the past 11 years. The physical examination revealed a well-defined , fleshy , reddish plaque measuring 10 Ã— 20 cm in diameter with erosions and black areas on the surface. The patient underwent surgical excision with margins of 10 mm followed by a skin graft. Histologic section showed a lesion<symptom> composed of 2 intimately intermingled epithelial and mesenchymal components associated with a basal cell carcinoma ( BCC). Immunohistochemical examination showed epithelial cells that were positive for CK AE1/AE3 and p53 , whereas stromal cells were positive for vimentin , CD10 , and p53. BCC was positive for CD10. On the basis of these findings , a diagnosis of trichoblastic carcinosarcoma associated with BCC was made. Given the scarcity of data available in the literature regarding this diagnosis , no standard of care exists. No adjuvant treatment was provided and after 1 year of follow-up , the patient did not experience recurrence.
