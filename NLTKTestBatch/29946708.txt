 Multiple states have laws requiring abortion<disease> facilities to meet ambulatory surgery center ( ASC) standards. There is limited evidence regarding abortion-related morbidities and adverse events following abortions<disease> performed at ASCs vs office-based settings. To compare abortion-related morbidities and adverse events at ASCs vs office-based settings. Retrospective cohort study of women with US private health insurance who underwent induced abortions<disease> in an ASC or office-based setting ( January 1 , 2011-December 31 , 2014). Outcomes were abstracted from a large national private insurance claims database during the 6 weeks following the abortion<disease> ( date of final follow-up , February 11 , 2015). Facility type for abortion<disease> ( ASCs vs office-based settings , including facilities such as abortion<disease> clinics , nonspecialized clinics , and physician offices). The primary outcome was any abortion-related morbidity or adverse event ( such as retained products of conception , abortion-related infection<disease> , hemorrhage<symptom> , and uterine perforation) within 6 weeks after an abortion<disease>. Two secondary outcomes , both subsets of the primary outcome , were major abortion-related morbidities and adverse events ( such as hemorrhages<symptom> treated with a transfusion , missed ectopic pregnancies treated with surgery , and abortion-related infections<disease> that resulted in an overnight hospital admission) and abortion-related infections<disease>. Among 49287 women ( mean age , 28 years ( SD , 7.3)) who had 50311 induced abortions<disease> , ( 23891 ( 47 %) first-trimester aspiration , 13480 ( 27 %) first-trimester medication , and 12940 ( 26 %) second trimester or later) , 5660 abortions<disease> ( 11 %) were performed in ASCs and 44651 ( 89 %) in office-based settings. Overall , 3.33 % had an abortion-related morbidity or adverse event; 0.32 % had a major abortion-related morbidity or adverse event; and 0.74 % had an abortion-related infection<disease>. In adjusted analyses , there was no statistically significant difference between ASCs vs office-based settings , respectively , in the rates of abortion-related morbidities or adverse events ( 3.25 % vs 3.33 % , difference , -0.8 %; 95 % CI , -0.58 % to 0.43 %; adjusted OR , 0.97; 95 % CI , 0.81-1.17) , major morbidities or adverse events ( 0.26 % vs 0.33 %; difference , -0.06 %; 95 % CI , -0.18 % to 0.06 %; adjusted OR , 0.78; 95 % CI , 0.45-1.37) , or infections<disease> ( 0.58 % vs 0.77 %; difference , -0.16 %; 95 % CI , -0.35 % to 0.03 %; adjusted OR , 0.75; 95 % CI , 0.52-1.09). Among women with private health insurance who had an induced abortion<disease> , performance of the abortion<disease> in an ambulatory surgical center compared with an office-based setting was not associated with a significant difference in abortion-related morbidities and adverse events. These findings , in addition to individual patient and individual facility factors , may inform decisions about the type of facility in which induced abortions<disease> are performed.
