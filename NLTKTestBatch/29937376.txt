 Fatty acid esters of hydroxylated fatty acids ( FAHFAs) were discovered as a novel class of endogenous mammalian lipids whose profound effects on metabolism have been shown. In the current study , in vitro and in vivo the metabolic effects of two of these FAHFAs , namely palmitic acid-5- ( or -9)- hydroxy-stearic acid ( 5- or 9-PAHSA , respectively) were profiled. In DIO mice fed with differentially composed low- or high-fat diets , acute and subchronic treatment with 5-PAHSA and 9-PAHSA alone , or in combination , did not significantly improve the deranged metabolic status<symptom>. Neither racemic 5- or 9-PAHSA , nor the enantiomers were able to: ( 1) increase basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in vitro , ( 2) stimulate GLP-1 release from GLUTag cells , or ( 3) induce GSIS in rat , mouse , or human islets or in a human pancreatic Î² cell line. Therefore , our data do not support the further development of PAHSAs or their derivatives for the control of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.
