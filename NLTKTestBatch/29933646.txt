 Alzheimer 's disease<disease> ( AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a growing epidemiological importance characterized by significant disease<disease> burden. Sleep-related pathological symptomatology often accompanies AD. The etiology and pathogenesis of disrupted circadian rhythm and AD share common factors , which also opens the perspective of viewing them as a mutually dependent process. This article focuses on the bi-directional relationship between these processes , discussing the pathophysiological links and clinical aspects. Common mechanisms linking both processes include neuroinflammation , neurodegeneration , and circadian rhythm desynchronization. Timely recognition of sleep-specific symptoms<symptom> as components of AD could lead to an earlier and correct diagnosis with an opportunity of offering treatments at an earlier stage. Likewise , proper sleep hygiene and related treatments ought to be one of the priorities in the management of the patient population affected by AD. This narrative review brings a comprehensive approach to clearly demonstrate the underlying complexities linking AD and circadian rhythm disruption. Most clinical data are based on interventions including melatonin , but larger-scale research is still scarce. Following a pathophysiological reasoning backed by evidence gained from AD models , novel anti-inflammatory treatments and those targeting metabolic alterations in AD might prove useful for normalizing a disrupted circadian rhythm. By restoring it , benefits would be conferred for immunological , metabolic , and behavioral function in an affected individual. On the other hand , a balanced circadian rhythm should provide greater resilience to AD pathogenesis.
