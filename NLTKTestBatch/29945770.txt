 The aim of this study was to analyse the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and interferon alpha ( IFN-α) in the follicular fluid ( FF) and their possible influence , as pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic factors , on in vitro fertilization outcome. The concentrations of VEGF and IFN-α were correlated with oocyte and embryo quality , concentrations of hormones in the serum , perifollicular blood flow and endometrial thickness. VEGF was detected in all FF samples ( median 706.6 pg/ml , range 182.9-6638 pg/ml). IFN-α was detected in 60 % of the samples ( median 6.5 pg/ml , range 0-79.4 pg/ml) , while in 40 % of the samples its levels were below the test detection limit. VEGF and IFN-α concentrations did not correlate with the cause of infertility<symptom> , concentrations of FSH , LH , E2 and prolactin , oocyte or embryo quality. Significantly higher concentrations of VEGF have been found in women with primary compared with secondary infertility<symptom> ( p = 0.011 , Mann Whitney test). The concentrations of VEGF and IFN-α did not correlate with the resistance index ( RI) on days of hCG administration , follicular aspiration and embryo transfer. However , the concentrations of IFN-α correlated with endometrial thickness on the day of embryo transfer ( Spearman correlation coefficient ρ = 0.4107; P < 0.05) but not on days of hCG administration and follicular aspiration. The mechanism of VEGF association with the previous ability of having a child needs to be clarified in future studies. The results of this study indicate a possible role of IFN-α in pathways of endometrial remodelling.
