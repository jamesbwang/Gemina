 Fanconi anemia<symptom> is a recessive disorder associated with chromosomal instability. It is marked by phenotypical heterogeneity which includes medullary deficiency , a variable malformation syndrome<symptom> , a predisposition to develop acute leukaemias myéloïdes ( ALM) and a cellular over-sensitiveness with the agents bridging the ADN. The diagnosis is based on the abnormal increase in the rate of spontaneous breaks chromosomal but especially and in a specific way , on a clear increase in these chromosomal breaks in the presence of bifunctional alkylating agents , which is the case in our six patients. Genetic counseling is that available for autosomal recessive diseases<disease>. We report our initial observations conducted at the University Hospital ( CHU) Hassan II of Fez confirmed by the detection of a large chromosomal instability after culture with Mitomycin C compared to a normal control group. The purpose of this study was to update our knowledge of Fanconi anemia<symptom> genes and to highlight the role of cytogenetics in its diagnosis and the genetic counseling for better management of affected children and their families.
