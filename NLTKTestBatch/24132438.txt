 The detection and management of chondral injuries of the hip , especially in a younger patient population , may preempt joint degeneration. Although the outcomes of preservation techniques have been well described for other weightbearing joints , such as the knee , evidence for hip<symptom> joint preservation after procedures such as microfracture and autologous chondrocyte implantation remains in its infancy. To evaluate outcomes of joint preservation procedures in the hip , including the success rate and patient-reported outcomes ( PROs). Systematic review; Level of evidence , 4. This review was performed using the terms `` hip arthroscopy , '' `` microfracture , '' `` autologous chondrocyte implantation , '' `` fibrin glue , '' `` osteochondral transfer , '' and variations thereof in 5 electronic databases , yielding 325 abstracts. After the application of eligibility criteria , 19 articles were included. Weighted means were calculated for PROs , and pooled estimates were calculated for age , follow-up , chondral lesion<symptom> size , and success of hip preservation procedures with a random-effects proportion meta-analysis. A total of 1484 patients ( 1502 hips<symptom>) were identified across 19 studies ( mean age , 38.0 ± 1.3 years; mean follow-up , 31.8 ± 9.6 months). Hip<symptom> joint preservation techniques demonstrated a high success rate , ranging from 85.6 % to 99.7 %. The mean pooled chondral lesion<symptom> size was 2.5 ± 0.3 cm Hip preservation procedures demonstrate a high success rate , with microfracture representing the most frequently utilized cartilage preservation technique in the peer-reviewed literature. PROs significantly improved after surgery. Further investigation of hip preservation modalities with long-term follow-up is required to create evidence-based clinical recommendations and treatment algorithms.
