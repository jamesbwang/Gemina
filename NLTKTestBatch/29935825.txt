 The objective of this study was to evaluate morbidity and mortality in preweaned dairy heifer calves based on different health , feeding , and management practices , as well as environmental factors. This study was conducted as part of the calf component of the National Animal Health Monitoring System 's Dairy 2014 study , which included 104 dairy operations in 13 states. The calf component was an 18-mo longitudinal study focused on dairy heifer calves from birth to weaning; data were collected on 2,545 calves. The percentage morbidity for all calves enrolled in the study was 33.9 %. Backward elimination model selection was used after univariate screening to determine which management practices and environmental factors significantly affected morbidity and mortality. The final morbidity model included birth weight<symptom> , serum IgG concentration , ventilation type , and average temperature-humidity index ( THI) during the preweaning period. After controlling for other independent variables in the model , calves born at a higher birth weight<symptom> had a lower predicted risk of morbidity than calves with a lower birth weight<symptom>. An increase in serum IgG concentration was associated with decreased morbidity. Calves housed in positive- or cross-ventilated systems had a 2.2 times higher odds of developing disease<disease> compared with calves housed in natural ventilation systems. Average THI during the preweaning period was inversely correlated with morbidity; as THI increased , the predicted morbidity risk decreased. The percent mortality for all calves enrolled in the study was 5.0 %. The final mortality model included birth weight<symptom> , serum IgG concentration , amount of fat/day in the liquid diet , and morbidity. After controlling for other independent variables in the model , calves born at a higher birth weight<symptom> had a lower risk of mortality. An increase in serum IgG concentration decreased the risk of mortality. The odds of mortality were 3.1 times higher in calves fed ≤ 0.15 kg of fat/d in the liquid diet compared with calves fed ≥ 0.22 kg of fat/d. The odds of mortality were 4.7 times higher in calves that experienced any disease<disease> throughout the preweaning period than in calves with no disease<disease>. In summary , morbidity and mortality were both associated with birth weight<symptom> and serum IgG concentration. Additionally , morbidity was associated with ventilation type and average monthly THI , and mortality was associated with amount of fat per day in the liquid diet and morbidity.
