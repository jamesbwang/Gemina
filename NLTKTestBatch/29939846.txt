: A case report of a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome<symptom> ( APS) with positive lupus anticoagulant and a mechanical mitral valve replacement ( MVR) who presented with a thrombosis and difficult-to-control INRs. Current literature on anticoagulation options for patients who present with these conditions as well as alternate laboratory assays are reviewed. APS can present a unique complexity and challenge to appropriate anticoagulation on warfarin. Although there are emerging data regarding the use of novel oral anticoagulants to treat this condition , they do not justify their use in a patient with APS and an MVR because of a current lack of evidence. CFX testing may be used to calibrate INRs when there is a concern for false readings because of lupus anticoagulant interaction with INR assays.
