 Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy ( NAION) may develop due to severe anaemia and hypotension<symptom> which is seen in acute<symptom> blood<symptom> loss<symptom>. The devastating visual loss is often irreversible. We report a case of NAION in a 20-year-old healthy woman , who presented on the third day of a heavy menstrual cycle with hypovolaemic shock<symptom>. On day 2 of admission , she had sudden right eye blurring of vision at the superior field on awakening from sleep. Funduscopy revealed a pale and swollen right optic disc. There was a dense right<symptom> superior altitudinal visual field defect. Her haemoglobin level was low ( 3.6 g/dL) , but she refused blood transfusion due to her religious belief ( Jehovah 's Witness) and opted for conservative management. She later developed right optic atrophy with persistent visual field defect despite an improved haemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL.
