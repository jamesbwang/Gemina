 Ultrasonography is the easiest non-invasive method to diagnose lymph node metastases in patients with head<disease> and neck cancer. However , since CT scans are often preferred in the evaluation of primary tumours of these patients , information about lymphatic metastases may also available in these patients. Therefore , ultrasound is not routinely employed in the evaluation of these patients. However , elastography technique , a recent development in ultrasound technology , could make use of ultrasonography in these patients even more widespread , even though it is still not widely used today. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of sonographic elastography in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis of head<disease> and neck cancer. Twenty-three patients diagnosed with head<disease> and neck cancer and scheduled for surgical treatment including neck dissection were included in the study. All patients underwent neck examination by palpation , ultrasound elastography and computerized tomography with contrast. To compare the diagnostic performance of palpation , ultrasound elastography and computerized tomography , the findings of each examination method were compared with the histopathological examination results of neck specimens. 15 ( 65.2 %) patients had a primary tumour in the larynx; 7 ( 30.4 %) in the oral cavity; and 1 ( 4.3 %) in the parotid<symptom>. 7 ( 30.4 %) out of 23 patients underwent bilateral neck dissection. In total , 30 neck dissections were hereby taken into account during study. Ultrasound elastography showed higher accuracy ( 83.3 %) and higher sensitivity ( 82.4 %) than palpation and computerized tomography , but the specificity of ultrasound elastography was lower ( 84.6 %) than palpation and computerized tomography. Ultrasound elastography is helpful for the diagnosis of lymph node metastases in patients with head<disease> and neck cancer. Due to its non-invasive character , it can be used safety in combination with other radiological techniques to support or improve their diagnostic performance.
