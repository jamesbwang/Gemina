 There is strong evidence to suggest that anxiety<symptom> is associated with paranoia in clinical and non-clinical samples. However , no research to date has directly manipulated anxiety<symptom> to investigate if state-anxiety has a causal role in state-paranoia in clinical populations. To investigate whether an anxious-mood induction leads to greater paranoia than a neutral-mood induction in people experiencing psychosis and paranoia and , if so , whether this is predicted by anxiety<symptom> over and above other variables. 22 participants with a psychosis-spectrum diagnosis took part in a two condition cross-over experimental design. Participants underwent a neutral-mood and an anxious-mood induction with levels of state-anxiety , state-affect and state-paranoia being measured before and after each condition. State-paranoia was significantly higher after the anxious condition compared with the neutral condition. State-anxiety and negative-affect were significant predictors of levels of state-paranoia after the anxious condition. When both predictors were included in a regression model , only negative-affect was a significant predictor of state-paranoia after the anxious condition. There were a number of methodological limitations. State-anxiety and negative-affect may both be involved in the maintenance of paranoia in clinical populations , as predicted by cognitive models. Negative-affect may be the strongest predictor of state-paranoia in clinical populations. Reasons for this are discussed , as well as the implications. Interventions that seek to reduce negative state-affect may be beneficial in managing state-paranoia. Further research is warranted to explore the suggested clinical and theoretical implications of these findings.
