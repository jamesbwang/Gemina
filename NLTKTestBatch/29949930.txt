 Given their severity and non-healing nature , diabetic chronic<disease> wounds<disease> are a significant concern to the 30.3 million Americans diagnosed with diabetes mellitus ( 2015). Peripheral arterial diseases<disease> , neuropathy , and infection<disease> contribute to the development of these wounds<disease> , which lead to an increased incidence of lower extremity amputations. Early recognition , debridement , offloading , and controlling infection<disease> are imperative for timely treatment. However , wound<disease> characterization and treatment are highly subjective and based largely on the experience of the treating clinician. Many wound<disease> dressings have been designed to address particular clinical presentations , but a prescriptive method is lacking for identifying the particular state of chronic , non-healing wounds<disease>. The authors suggest that recent developments in wound<disease> dressings and biosensing may allow for the quantitative , real-time representation of the wound<disease> environment , including exudate<symptom> levels , pathogen concentrations , and tissue regeneration. Development of such sensing capability could enable more strategic , personalized care at the onset of ulceration and limit the infection<disease> leading to amputation. This review presents an overview of the pathophysiology of diabetic chronic<disease> wounds<disease> , a brief summary of biomaterial wound<disease> dressing treatment options , and biosensor development for biomarker sensing in the wound<disease> environment.
