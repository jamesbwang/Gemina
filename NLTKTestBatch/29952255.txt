 The current health system in Ontario is not designed to meet the needs of frail older adults. This is particularly true for older adults hospitalized due to exacerbation of chronic illness or medical crisis. This article describes the Subacute Care Unit for the Frail Elderly ( SAFE) program , one which is designed to serve frail older patients who are at risk of deconditioning or disability associated with prolonged hospitalization but who may safely return home or to a retirement home following up to 4 weeks of subacute care in a restorative environment. The program centres on an intense restorative and integrated care delivery model. The patient population is medically complex , requiring medical supervision and regular adjustment to the care plan to optimize medical status<symptom>. Individuals are no longer acutely ill and are considered stable or stabilizing. Care and services are designed to improve outcomes for hospitalized frail older adults by proactively addressing the conditions that contribute to alternate level of care before the deconditioning associated with prolonged hospitalization is experienced.
