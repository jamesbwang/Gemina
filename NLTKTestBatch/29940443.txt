 Aquatic plants in shallow freshwater lakes play a key role in stabilizing ecological function and providing valuable ecosystem services , yet they are severely degraded worldwide. An improved understanding of long-term aquatic plant succession is critical to investigate the potential driving mechanisms and to facilitate ecological restoration. In this paper , we reconstructed changes in the aquatic plant community over the past century based on palynological records from Changdang Lake , Middle and Lower Yangtze River<disease> Basin ( MLYB) , China. Our results reveal that aquatic plants in Changdang Lake have undergone three clear phases: emergent macrophytes dominated the aquatic vegetation in the 1900s-1970s , submerged macrophytes in the 1970s-1990s , and floating macrophytes increasingly after the 1990s. Significant changes in the aquatic plant communities were caused by increasing anthropogenic pressures<symptom> , such as damming and nutrient loading from agriculture , aquaculture , and urbanization after the Chinese economic reform. We argue that Changdang Lake is currently in a transition phase between a macrophyte-dominated state and an algae-dominated state. Our palynological record is different from many contemporary studies , which suggest submerged plants dominated most lakes in this region before the 1950s. We suggest that the return of the aquatic plants to their 1970s-1980s state would be a realistic target for lake restoration. Our results show that palynological records can reveal long-term dynamics of macrophytes in shallow lakes for sustainable lake restoration and management.
