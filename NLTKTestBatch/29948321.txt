 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and the safety of a new skin incision for minimally invasive anterior lumbar interbody fusion ( ALIF): the perinavel incision. Demographic and clinical data from patients who underwent ALIF with the perinavel incision were collected. Indications to surgery , preoperative symptoms<symptom> , radiological data , number of treated levels , intraoperative and early postoperative complications and wound-related problems were analysed. Ninety-seven patients underwent ALIF with this new skin incision. One hundred fifty-seven levels were treated ( mean 1.7 level per patient) being L4-L5 the most frequently treated. Intraoperative complications were represented only by the venous injury with a rate of 3.09 % ( 3 cases). Postoperative complications were all linked to skin incision issues: a case of wound<disease> dehiscence and a case of superficial<disease> infection<disease>infection<disease>. No case of skin<symptom> necrosis<symptom> occurs at 3-month follow-up. In this paper , the perinavel skin incision was demonstrated to be as safe as traditional approaches for ALIF. Furthermore , with this incision it is possible to perform multilevel ( L3-S1) ALIF , which means a good option in minimally invasive surgery as well as revision surgery.
