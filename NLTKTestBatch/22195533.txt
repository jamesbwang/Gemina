 Susceptible individuals who have suffered painful stings caused by red imported fire ants , Solenopsis invicta , usually experience physical health effects such as fever<symptom> , dizziness<symptom> , generalized urticaria , or other systemic reactions such as anaphylactic shock<symptom>. Whether S. invicta stings also have negative effects on mental health is not clear. In the present study , the psychological impact of S. invicta stings was evaluated using a questionnaire that included a previously published posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) checklist , the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item ( PHQ-9) , the Generalized Anxiety<symptom> Disorder 7-item ( GAD-7) scale , the Beck Anxiety<symptom> Inventory ( BAI) , and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , 5th scale ( PSQI ( 5)). A total of 96 valid questionnaires were obtained; 37 participants were placed in the stung group , and 59 participants were placed in the unstung group. Our results showed that symptoms<symptom> of anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> and sleep disturbances were not associated with S. invicta stings ( for GAD-7 scale , Pearson Chi-Square test , χ2 = 0.152 , df = 1 , P = 0.697; for the BAI , χ2 = 2.252 , df = 1 , P = 0.133; for the PHQ-9 , χ2 = 0.098 , df = 1 , P = 0.754; for the PSQI ( 5) , χ2 = 0.536 , df = 1 , P = 0.453). In total , 2 of 83 individuals stung by S. invicta met the criteria ( > 50) for PTSD. However , there was no significant difference on PTSD between those stung by S. invicta in the 30-day group and the over 30-day group ( χ2 = 0.318 , df = 1 , P = 0.573). Overall , our data do not show an effect of S. invicta stings on mental health as measured using a range of indicators.
