 Many human action sequences , such as speaking and performing music , are inherently rhythmic: Sequence events are produced at quasi-regular temporal intervals. A wide range of interindividual variation has been noted in spontaneous<symptom> production<symptom> rates of these rhythmic action sequences. Dynamical theories of motor coordination<symptom> suggest that individuals spontaneously produce rhythmic sequences at a natural frequency characterized by minimal energy expenditure and maximal temporal stability , relative to other frequencies. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the temporal variability with which musicians performed rhythmic melodies at their natural spontaneous rate with variability in their performances at faster and slower rates. Musicians ' temporal variability was lowest during performances at their spontaneous rate; in addition , performers ' tempo drift during trials at other rates showed bias toward their spontaneous rate. This study provides the first direct evidence that spontaneous rates of motor coordination<symptom> represent optimally stable natural frequencies of endogenous rhythms.
