 To determine the prevalence of arthritis<disease> in Kawasaki disease<disease> ( KD) and the clinical characteristics of children with KD and arthritis<disease>. This was a single-centre , 15-year , retrospective study of children admitted with KD. Clinical features ( including coronary involvement) , laboratory results and treatment response were evaluated. Of 63 children with KD , 60.3 % were male , with a median of age of 2.0 years. Complete KD was found in 68.3 %. The time from symptom<symptom> onset to treatment was 7.0 days ( median); 30.7 % had coronary artery aneurysms<disease> , from which 82.5 % responded to intravenous immunoglobulin. During the course of their illness , eight children developed arthritis<disease> ( 12.7 %) , which was early onset in six ( 75 %) and oligoarticular in five ( 62.5 %). The median number of joints was 3.5 ( P This study emphasises the value of a systematic articular examination of joints in KD. Refractory KD was observed in children with late-onset arthritis<disease>.
