 To present an unusual extrapyramidal motor<symptom> response<symptom> occurring after a sympathetic block in CRPS and its successful treatment with diphenhydramine. Severe<symptom> pain<symptom> related to Complex Regional Pain Syndrome<symptom> type 1 interfering with activities of daily living. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome<symptom> type 1. We report a video case reports of two patients with a diagnosis of CRPS type-I. Both patients exhibited similar presentation of unusual extrapyramidal motor<symptom> response<symptom> of the affected limb following lumbar sympathetic block. Both patients were treated with intravenous diphenhydramine to abort the extrapyramidal motor<symptom> response<symptom>. Both patients similarly responded to treatment with intravenous diphenhydramine with abrupt resolution of the motor<symptom> response<symptom>. Sympathetic blockade may interfere with the adaptive autonomic reflex circuits of the motor balance<symptom> homeostasis in patients with complex regional pain syndrome<symptom>. Disinhibition of extrapyramidal system may lead to immediate expression of extrapyramidal signs following the sympathetic block. Diphenhydramine , with its anti-histaminic and anticholinergic properties , may be effective in aborting such extrapyramidal signs , and should be considered as a treatment option in similar cases.
