 the aim of the current study was to evaluate and compare the quality of life ( QOL) and psychological status of adult patients who underwent heart transplant ( HTx) at pediatric or adult ages. The population consisted of two groups: patients who received HTx after 18 years-old , pediatrics who received HTx between the age of 1 and 18 years. At the time of the study all patients were over 18 years old. QOL data were collected from patients using 36-item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36) and psychological-distress by the Symptom<symptom> checklist 90-revised questionnaire ( SCL-90-R). A total of 232 HTx patients were evaluated; 217 were transplanted at an adult-age and 15 at a pediatric one. QOL improved significantly in pediatrics patients in the General-Health-Perceptions subscale and Physical-Pain subscale than adult patients. The Global-Index of the psychological-distress did not differ in the two groups , but the pediatric patients registered statistically significant higher scores on the Interpersonal-Sensitivity symptom<symptom> subscale ( adult group 36 ± .42 vs pediatric group 81 ± .79) , the Hostility subscale ( adult group m 39 ± .44 vs pediatric group 73 ± .76) and the Paranoid-Ideation subscale ( adult group 46 ± .46 vs pediatric group 96 ± 1.02). The pediatric heart recipients showed better quality of life but they show marked sensitivity , hostility , and paranoid ideation which increases the risk of mental distress and therefore their adherence to medical treatment.
