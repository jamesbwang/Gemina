 Occupational asthma occurs in a significant number of adult unset forms of asthma. Even after exposure cessation , persistent asthma is frequent. Although recognized as important , nutrition , and specifically vitamin D intake , was rarely evaluated in occupational asthma. To assess the vitamin D intake in occupational asthma patients and the relation with body mass index , co-morbidities related to vitamin D deficit , lung function and quality of life. We found a reduced vitamin D intake in both irritant and allergic asthma , in obese and non-obese patients. The average intake in non-obese patients , although higher , did not reach statistical significance. We also found lower vitamin D intake in the mild ashma group versus the severe group , marginally reaching the significance level ( p = 0.056) at the median test. Regression analysis in asthma subpopulations revealed a different pattern of correlation , with stronger relationship between the BMI and the impact score in irritant asthma and a closer link between vitamin D intake and symptoms<symptom> score ( p = 0.027) in the allergic asthma group. The relation between obesity and vitamin D on clinical scores and lung function seams to be different according to the asthma phenotype. However , our study supports the usefulness of nutritional interventions in all occupational asthma patients , targeting both the reduction of the fat mass and the achievement of the recommended daily intake of vitamin D. When analyzing the impact of the weight<symptom> loss<symptom> effect on asthma evolution , the vitamin D status<symptom> should be also considered as influencer.
