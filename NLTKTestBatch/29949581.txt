 Unresolved taxonomy of threatened species is problematic for conservation as the field relies on species being distinct taxonomic units. Differences in breeding habitat and results from a preliminary molecular analysis indicated that the New Zealand population of the South Georgian Diving Petrel ( Pelecanoides georgicus) was a distinct , yet undescribed , species. We measured 11 biometric characters and scored eight plumage characters in 143 live birds and 64 study skins<disease> originating from most populations of P. georgicus , to assess their taxonomic relationships. We analysed differences with principal component analyses ( PCA) , factorial ANOVAs , and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. Results show that individuals from New Zealand differ significantly from P. georgicus from all other populations as following: 1) longer wings , 2) longer outer tail feathers<symptom> , 3) deeper bills , 4) longer heads<symptom> , 5) longer tarsi , 6) limited collar extent , 7) greater extent of contrasting scapulars , 8) larger contrasting markings on the secondaries , 9) paler ear coverts , 10) paler collars , and 11) paler flanks. Furthermore , we used a species delimitation test with quantitative phenotypic criteria; results reveal that the New Zealand population of P. georgicus indeed merits species status<symptom>. We hereby name this new species Pelecanoides whenuahouensis sp. nov.. Due to severe reductions in its range and the very low number of remaining birds ( ~ 150 individuals limited to a single breeding colony on Codfish Island/Whenua Hou) the species warrants listing as ` Critically Endangered '.
