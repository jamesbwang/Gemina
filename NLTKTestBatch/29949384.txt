 Background Patients on hemodialysis ( HD) are at increased risk for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The autonomic nervous system ( ANS) dysfunction seems to participate in the arrhythmogenic process. Genetic factors have an impact on ANS modulation , but the specific role of the insertion/deletion ( I/D) polymorphism in the gene for angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE) had not been investigated. Since D allele increases the gene expression , it is a candidate polymorphism to interact with the ANS. Objective To compare the dynamic profile of heart rate variability ( HRV) during a HD session , a surrogate for the ANS response to stressors , between the ACE genotypes. Methods In a sample of chronic kidney disease<disease> patients , the I/D ACE genotypes were assessed with polymerase chain reaction , and the HRV was measured before , in the second hour , and after a HD session. The HRV parameters in the time and frequency domains were analyzed by repeated measures mixed models according to the time of measurement and the ACE polymorphism. Results HRV parameters in the frequency domain presented significantly different variation during the HD session between patients with or without the D allele. Only patients with II genotype presented increase in the low-frequency ( LF) normalized units and in the LF/HF ratio , throughout HD. Conclusions Patients with II genotype seem to have a more physiological<symptom> response<symptom> to volemic and electrolytic changes occurring during HD , with greater sympathetic activation than patients with ID and DD genotypes.
