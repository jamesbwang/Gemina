 The burden of pneumococcal disease<disease> at Hajj has not been precisely evaluated through a systematic review. To this end we have conducted a systematic review on the burden of clinical infections due to Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom> among Hajj pilgrims. Major electronic databases including OVID Medline , Web of Science , OVID Embase , Social Sciences Citation Index , Google Scholar and relevant websites ( e.g. , online Saudi Epidemiology Bulletin) were searched by using MeSH terms and text words containing but not limited to ` Hajj ' , pneumonia<disease><symptom> and S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom>. This was buttressed by hand searching of reference lists of identified studies. Of 21 full text papers reviewed , nine articles were included in this review. Seven studies reported the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia<disease><symptom> and the other two reported the burden of invasive pneumococcal diseases<disease> including meningitis<disease><symptom> and sepsis<disease>. The proportion of pneumonia<disease><symptom> that was pneumococcal ranged from 1 % to 54 % of bacteriologically confirmed pneumonias<disease><symptom>. The pneumococcus accounted for 2/3rd of bacteriologically diagnosed meningitis<disease><symptom> cases , and 1/3rd of confirmed cases of sepsis<disease>. Case fatality rate of pneumococcal pneumonia<disease><symptom> was recorded in only two studies: 33.3 % and 50 %. Only one study provided data on antimicrobial susceptibility of S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom> isolates , reporting 33.3 % to be penicillin resistant. None of the included studies provided data on serotype distribution of S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom>. This systematic review highlights the significance of pneumococcal disease<disease> during Hajj , and demonstrates paucity of data on its burden particularly on disease-causing serotype.
