 The aim of this study was to characterize the microstructure of two zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ( ZLS) glass-ceramics and evaluate their mechanical properties before and after the crystallization firing process ( CFP). Field emission-scanning electron microscope ( FE-SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDS) analyses were performed for microstructural characterization. To evaluate the pattern of crystallization and the molecular composition of ZLS glass-ceramics , was used X-ray diffraction ( XRD). Vickers hardness , fracture toughness by the indentation method , and biaxial flexural strength were also measured. One hundred and forty ceramic discs were produced ( diameter = 12 mm; thickness = 1.2 mm) and allocated among four groups ( n = 30): Sfir , Sunf-ZLS Vita Suprinity; and Cfir and Cunf-ZLS Celtra Duo; fired and unfired , respectively. Statistical analysis was performed and Weibull failure probabilities were calculated. Cfir showed the highest characteristic strength ( 251.25 MPa) and hardness ( 693.333 ± 10.85 GPa). Conversely , Sunf presented the lowest characteristic strength ( 106.95 MPa) and significantly lowest hardness ( 597.533 ± 33.97 GPa). According to Weibull analysis , Sunf had the highest structural reliability ( m = 7.07) , while Sfir presented the lowest ( m = 5.38). The CFP was necessary to crystallize zirconia in the partially crystallized ZLS glass-ceramics. Sfir had a lower percentage of crystallized zirconia than did Cfir. Fractographic analyses showed that all failures<symptom> initiated from an inherent critical defect in Sunf and from processing defects in the remaining groups. The CFP had a direct influence on the flexural strength and microstructural characteristics of both ZLS materials.
