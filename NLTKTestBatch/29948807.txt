 The Chronic Care Model ( CCM) has been endorsed by experts to reduce disparities in chronic<disease> disease<disease>disease<disease> outcomes but benefits may be slow to appear in low-income populations. To evaluate the effect of CCM implementation on systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) control in minority patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM). Retrospective study from 2012 to 2016 in two primary care clinics with primarily uninsured , Hispanic patients. Four 2-year cohorts of patients aged 18-75 with DM and SBP â‰¥ 140 mmHg on HTN drugs in year 1 and SBP measured 1 year later in year 2. Implementation of CCM for DM in January 2014 involved: electronic medical record revision , a DM registry , hypertension ( HTN) treatment protocol , team education , performance feedback , and case management. SBP < 140 mmHg in year 2. Of 2354 patients , the mean age was 56.2 ( SD 9.5) , baseline SBP 153.8 ( SD 14.9) mmHg , and 79.8 % Hispanic. Last SBP < 140 mmHg was 58.4 % for cohort 1 ( 2012-2013) and 68.5 % for cohort 4 ( 2015-2016). Adjusted odds ratios ( AORs) for SBP control versus cohort 1 were 1.35 ( 95 % CI 1.07 , 1.69) for cohort 3 ( 2014-2015) and 2.13 ( 95 % CI 1.60 , 2.80) for cohort 4. AORs for SBP control were reduced by 15 % per HTN drug at baseline ( P = 0.001) , 9 % per HTN drug added at last SBP ( P = 0.024) , and 22 % for multi-dose HTN drugs ( P = 0.004). Among patients with persistent elevated SBP and represented in multiple cohorts , AORs for control were still over 2-fold higher for cohort 4 versus cohort 1. After adopting the CCM for primarily Hispanic patients with DM , SBP control increased significantly despite treatment with fewer HTN drugs. Yet improvement took 3-4 years , suggesting that financial rewards for using the CCM to achieve improved clinical outcomes for low-income , minority patients may be delayed.
