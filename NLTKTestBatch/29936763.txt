 Osteoblastic metastasis of breast cancer is relatively rare , but there are cases of misdiagnosis and mistreatment in clinical treatment. They can only be diagnosed by X ray or CT bone scan and must be identified from bone repair after effective treatment in patients with osteolytic or mixed bone metastases. Bone metastasis is often seen in the disease-free condition of breast cancer , and very few can occur in stage Ⅳ lesions<symptom> prior to surgery. Based on the analysis of clinical phenomena , we questioned the evaluation criteria of the therapeutic effect on bone metastasis of breast cancer created by the World Health Organization and the MD Anderson Cancer Center and concluded the formation mechanism of bone metastasis. For patients with simple osteoblastic bone metastasis , we broke through the recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline and advocated the concept of `` noninterference ''. Patients with positive hormone receptor can be treated with traditional endocrine therapy. Hormone receptor negative and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive patients can be observed first , followed by chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy when there is osteolytic bone metastasis or visceral metastasis. Furthermore , bisphosphonates are not required since osteoblastic bone metastasis is generally not associated with the risk of bone related events. The active treatment of primary lesion<symptom> should be taken into account in stage Ⅳ patient before operation.
