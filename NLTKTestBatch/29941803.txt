 We estimated the daily intakes of chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin via ingestion of indoor dust and outdoor soils using the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation Model on a probabilistic approach for Taiwanese young children. Variables for the estimation , such as concentration , ingestion rate , and body<symptom> weight<symptom> , were adopted from previous studies. Monte Carlo simulation was performed with 1,000,000 iterations to simulate a single daily intake , which was shown in terms of percentage of the Acceptable Daily Intake ( ADI) of either insecticide. The daily intakes are minimal with a 99 % probability , but go up steeply at the 99.9 th percentile ( 13.1 % and 20.0 % of the ADIs of chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin , respectively). The sensitivity analysis indicates that concentration is the most determinant variable for daily intake estimation , suggesting that high intakes may occur when insecticide concentrations are elevated. Compared to the data of daily intakes via dietary ingestion of vegetables derived from a previous study , the estimated non-dietary intakes are negligible until reaching the highest percentile. Consequently , the non-dietary ingestion exposure to either insecticide is commonly low for young children in Taiwan & rsquo; s homes , unless high contamination ( e.g. , indoor insecticide application) occurs in the environment. Care has to be taken to avoid high contamination indoors.
