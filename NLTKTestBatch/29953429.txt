 Treatment of latent tuberculosis<disease> infection<disease> ( LTBI) is critical to the control and elimination of tuberculosis<disease> disease<disease> ( TB) in the United States. In 2011 , CDC recommended a short-course combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks ( 3HP) by directly observed therapy ( DOT) for treatment of LTBI , with limitations for use in children aged < 12 years and persons with human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infection<disease> ( 1). CDC identified the use of 3HP in those populations , as well as self-administration of the 3HP regimen , as areas to address in updated recommendations. In 2017 , a CDC Work Group conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of the 3HP regimen using methods adapted from the Guide to Community Preventive Services. In total , 19 articles representing 15 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis , which determined that 3HP is as safe and effective as other recommended LTBI regimens and achieves substantially higher treatment completion rates. In July 2017 , the Work Group presented the meta-analysis findings to a group of TB experts , and in December 2017 , CDC solicited input from the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis<disease> ( ACET) and members of the public for incorporation into the final recommendations. CDC continues to recommend 3HP for treatment of LTBI in adults and now recommends use of 3HP 1) in persons with LTBI aged 2-17 years; 2) in persons with LTBI who have HIV<pathogen> infection<disease> , including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome<symptom> ( AIDS) , and are taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine; and 3) by DOT or self-administered therapy ( SAT) in persons aged â‰¥ 2 years.
