 To identify the latest progression on medical treatment of urinary stones. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be the preferred analgesic option for patients presenting to the emergency department with renal colic<symptom>. A-blockers could be of patient benefit when used for distal ureteral stones more than 5 mm in size. However , the quality of the randomized controlled studies on medical expulsive therapy ( MET) is still low based on the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials ( CONSORT) criteria. MET should be used with caution in children and pregnant women. In patients with renal stones , the evaluation of the comorbidities of developing chronic Kidney Disease<disease> ( CKD) or End Stage Renal Disease<disease> ( ESRD) is mandatory. It is highly recommended to follow the European Association of Urology Urolithiasis Guidelines Panel Diagnostic and Therapeutic algorithms to prevent stone recurrence. Medical treatment of urinary stone disease<disease> should be supported by well designed higher level of evidence clinical research.
