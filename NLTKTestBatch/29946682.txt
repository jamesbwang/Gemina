 End-of-life care costs are high and decedents often experience poor quality of care. Numerous factors influence changes in site of death , health care transitions , and burdensome patterns of care. To describe changes in site of death and patterns of care among Medicare decedents. Retrospective cohort study among a 20 % random sample of 1361870 decedents who had Medicare fee-for-service ( 2000 , 2005 , 2009 , 2011 , and 2015) and a 100 % sample of 871845 decedents who had Medicare Advantage ( 2011 and 2015) and received care at an acute care hospital , at home or in the community , at a hospice inpatient care unit , or at a nursing home. Secular changes between 2000 and 2015. Medicare administrative data were used to determine site of death , place of care , health care transitions , which are changes in location of care , and burdensome patterns of care. Burdensome patterns of care were based on health care transitions during the last 3 days of life and multiple hospitalizations for infections<disease> or dehydration<symptom> during the last 120 days of life. The site of death and patterns of care were studied among 1361870 decedents who had Medicare fee-for-service ( mean ( SD) age , 82.8 ( 8.4) years; 58.7 % female) and 871845 decedents who had Medicare Advantage ( mean ( SD) age , 82.1 ( 8.5) years; 54.0 % female). Among Medicare fee-for-service decedents , the proportion of deaths that occurred in an acute care hospital decreased from 32.6 % ( 95 % CI , 32.4 % -32.8 %) in 2000 to 19.8 % ( 95 % CI , 19.6 % -20.0 %) in 2015 , and deaths in a home or community setting that included assisted living facilities increased from 30.7 % ( 95 % CI , 30.6 % -30.9 %) in 2000 to 40.1 % ( 95 % CI , 39.9 % -30.3 %) in 2015. Use of the intensive care unit during the last 30 days of life among Medicare fee-for-service decedents increased from 24.3 % ( 95 % CI , 24.1 % -24.4 %) in 2000 and then stabilized between 2009 and 2015 at 29.0 % ( 95 % CI , 28.8 % -29.2 %). Among Medicare fee-for-service decedents , health care transitions during the last 3 days of life increased from 10.3 % ( 95 % CI , 10.1 % -10.4 %) in 2000 to a high of 14.2 % ( 95 % CI , 14.0 % -14.3 %) in 2009 and then decreased to 10.8 % ( 95 % CI , 10.6 % -10.9 %) in 2015. The number of decedents enrolled in Medicare Advantage during the last 90 days of life increased from 358600 in 2011 to 513245 in 2015. Among decedents with Medicare Advantage , similar patterns in the rates for site of death , place of care , and health care transitions were observed. Among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who died in 2015 compared with 2000 , there was a lower likelihood of dying in an acute care hospital , an increase and then stabilization of intensive care unit use during the last month of life , and an increase and then decline in health care transitions during the last 3 days of life.
