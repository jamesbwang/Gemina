 The aim of this study was to develop a low-cost methodology for preparing different thickened liquids with different consistencies and viscosities that mimic the viscosities of culturally relevant traditional Egyptian liquids , which can be easily used in the fiberoptic-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. The textures of 9 traditional Egyptian liquids were quantified with the International Dysphagia<symptom> Diet Standardisation Initiative ( IDDSI) Flow Test and spanned the entire range of the IDDSI scale. We then developed texture-modified fluids that matched each dietary fluid texture for endoscopic dysphagia<symptom> assessment using a regionally available , inexpensive , starch-based thickening agent. Our results indicate simple methods of assuring that fluids used during swallowing testing with endoscopy can be matched to dietary fluids to ensure appropriate dietary prescriptions for people with dysphagia<symptom>. The changes in the thickness and viscosity of the prepared liquid samples were detected and studied separately. The measured samples include some traditional Egyptian fluids ( molokhia , lentil soup) in addition to commercially available fluids and pudding. The method can be applied to develop thickened liquids with different consistencies to model the traditional , naturally thickened liquids in Egypt and many other developing countries.
