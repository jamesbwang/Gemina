 Depression<symptom> is a prevalent and complex psychiatric syndrome<symptom>. Epigenetic mechanisms bridge the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of depression<symptom>. A surge of research over the last decade has identified changes in DNA methylation , histone modifications , histone organization , and noncoding RNAs associated with depression<symptom> and stress-induced depression-like behavior in animal models. We focus here on associations of epigenetic factors concurrent with depression<symptom> and depression-like behavior , although risk for depression<symptom> and some of the associated epigenetic changes are known to have developmental origins. Finally , emerging technology may enable breakthroughs in the ability to rescue depression-associated epigenetic modifications at specific genes , greatly enhancing specificity of future potential therapeutic treatments.
