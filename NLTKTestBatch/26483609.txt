 Time-lapse MRI was implemented for dynamic non-invasive cell tracking of individual slowly moving intravascular immune cells. Repetitive MRI acquisition enabled dynamic observation of iron oxide nanoparticle ( ION) labelled cells. Simulations of MRI contrast indicated that only cells moving slower than 1 µm/s were detectable. Time-lapse MRI of the brain was performed after either IONs or ION-labelled monocytes were injected intravenously into naïve and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<pathogen><disease> ( EAE) bearing mice at a presymptomatic or symptomatic stage. EAE mice showed a reduced number of slow moving , i.e. patrolling cells before and after onset of symptoms<symptom> as compared to naïve controls. This observation is consistent with the notion of altered cell dynamics , i.e. higher velocities of immune cells rolling along the endothelium in the inflamed condition. Thus , time-lapse MRI enables for assessing immune cell dynamics non-invasively in deep tissue and may serve as a tool for detection or monitoring of an inflammatory response.
