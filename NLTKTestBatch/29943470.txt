 The pharmacokinetic ( PK) properties of enrofloxacin ( ENR) and its metabolite ciprofloxacin ( CIP) were investigated in crucian carp following oral administration at different dose levels ( 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 mg/kg body<symptom> weight<symptom>). The disposition kinetics of ENR was found to be linear over the dose range studied. Serum half-lives ranged from 64.56 to 72.68 hr. The in vitro and ex vivo activities of ENR in serum against a pathogenic strain of Aeromonas<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> were determined. In vitro and ex vivo bactericidal activity of ENR was concentration dependent. Dosing of 10 mg/kg resulted in an AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) ratio of 368.92 hr and a C
