 Ovarian pregnancy is very rare , and contralateral tubal pregnancy coexisting with ovarian pregnancy must be even rarer. A 33-year-old Korean nulliparous woman was referred to our hospital because she suffered lower abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and had missed her periods after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination. We could not identify any normal gestational sac in the endometrium , or specific ectopic pregnancies , on an initial ultrasound scan. However , there was a large hematoma in the cul-de-sac and free fluid in the right paracolic gutter. We decided to perform emergent laparoscopic surgery. We found contralateral tubal and ovarian ectopic pregnancies. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of a case in which a patient underwent laparoscopic right salpingectomy and left ovarian ectopic mass excision due to contralateral tubal and ovarian ectopic pregnancies after assisted reproductive technology.
