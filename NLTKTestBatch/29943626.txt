 Background Insulin is involved in a glucose homeostatic regulation and a cellular metabolism via phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K) pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathway. Hyperinsulinemia reduces insulin sensitivity and is an obvious potential factor affecting airway inflammation in chronic airway diseases<disease>. MUC5AC is a major secreted mucin , which plays a critical role in inflammatory response in the respiratory<disease> tract<symptom>. However , the relationship between insulin and MUC5AC expression has not been studied. Objective This study investigated the effect and the brief signaling pathway of high concentration of insulin ( HI) on MUC5AC expression in human airway epithelial cell. Methods In NCI-H292 cells and primary cultures of normal nasal epithelial cells , the effect and signaling pathway of HI on MUC5AC expression were investigated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) , real-time PCR , enzyme immunoassay , and immunoblot analysis with several specific inhibitors and small interfering RNA ( siRNA). Results HI significantly increased MUC5AC expression and activated PI3K/AKT , extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2) and p38 MAPKs. The specific PI3K and AKT inhibitor as well as knockdown of AKT1 and AKT2 by the respective siRNAs significantly blocked HI-mediated expression of MUC5AC. Meanwhile , the specific ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK inhibitor as well as knockdown of ERK1 , ERK2 , and p38 MAPK by the respective siRNAs also attenuated HI-induced expression of MUC5AC. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that HI induces MUC5AC expression via PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways in human airway epithelial cells.
