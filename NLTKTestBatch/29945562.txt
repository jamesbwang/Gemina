 Effective treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer are finite. NAPOLI-1 , a phase III randomized trial , demonstrated the efficacy of nanoliposomal irinotecan with fluorouracil/leucovorin ( nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer following progression on gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. There are limited additional data on the safety and efficacy of nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV following FDA approval in October 2015. We examined the post-approval safety and effectiveness of nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV in advanced pancreatic cancer patients receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients beginning treatment with nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV from October 2015 through June 2017. Using the electronic medical record and institutional database , information was extracted pertaining to demographics , performance status<symptom> ( ECOG) , prior therapies , dose , duration of treatment , adverse events , progression free survival ( PFS) , overall survival ( OS) and treatment response. Fifty six patients were identified. Median progression free survival ( PFS) was 2.9 months and median overall survival ( OS) was 5.3 months. Patients with prior disease<disease> progression on irinotecan experienced PFS and OS of 2.2 and 3.9 mo , respectively. Patients without prior irinotecan exposure experienced significantly longer PFS ( 4.8 mo , p = 0.02) and OS ( 7.7 mo , p = 0.002) , as did patients who received prior irinotecan without disease<disease> progression ( PFS , 5.7 mo , p = 0.04; OS , 9.0 mo , p = .04). Progression on prior irinotecan was associated with greater lines of prior advanced disease<disease> chemotherapy ( 2 vs 1). Dose reductions ( DR) were most frequently due to fatigue<symptom> ( 42 %) and diarrhea<disease> ( 37 %) , but were not associated with worse outcomes. In fact , patients with â‰¥ 1 DR experienced longer PFS ( 5.4 v 2.6 mo , p = 0.035). Sequential therapy with nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine ( nab-P + Gem) followed by nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV ( n = 25) resulted in OS of 23.0 mo.. Mutations in TP53 were associated with shorter PFS. These data support the safety and efficacy of nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV , reinforcing results of NAPOLI-1. Patients without disease<disease> progression on prior irinotecan fared significantly better than patients with progression , when treated with nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV. Sequential therapy with nab-P + Gem followed by nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV demonstrates encouraging median OS. These findings provide guidance for patients most likely to benefit from nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV.
