 Central nervous system ( CNS) involvement in hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection has different facets such as anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , cognitive impairment and vasculitis. We were interested in detecting subclinical CNS involvement in chronic HCV<pathogen> infected subjects with and without systemic vasculitis. Nineteen patients ( 15 females and 4 males) with chronic HCV<pathogen> infection ( mean age 46.5 ± 7 and mean duration since diagnosis of HCV<pathogen> infection 4.7 ± 4 years , including 6 ( 32 %) Child-Pugh class A cirrhotic patients) and 30 age , sex and education matched healthy control subjects were studied. Thirteen patients had associated vasculitis. Patients and control subjects were assessed using the block design and comprehension subtests of Wechsler Bellevue Adult Intelligence Scale , Wechsler Memory scale ( WMS) , Beck Anxiety<symptom> Inventory ( BAI) and Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory ( BDI). Brain HMPAO Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT) was performed for HCV<pathogen> patients. Patients with HCV<pathogen> had lower scores on the block design test compared to control subjects ( 8.37 ± 1.89 versus 10.37 ± 1.47 , p < 0.001) , lower total WMS scores ( 43.15 ± 10.49 versus 60.27 ± 8.08 , p < 0.001) and higher anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> scores ( 16.94 ± 10.46 and 37.17 ± 10.38 versus 10.3 ± 4.67 and 28.9 ± 5.99 , p = 0.004 and 0.001 , respectively). Total WMS were lower in HCV<pathogen> patients with vasculitis compared to those without vasculitis ( 39.14 ± 9.3 versus 51.17 ± 8.3 , p = 0.019) while the block design and comprehension tests , BAI and BDI were not significantly different between both groups. The block design and comprehension tests , WMS , BAI and BDI were not significantly different between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Seven patients had different patterns of cerebral hypoperfusion on SPECT , and all of them had associated vasculitis. Abnormal SPECT was associated with lower total WMS scores ( 35.87 ± 10.8 versus 46.79 ± 8.6 in those with normal SPECT , p = 0.049). Vasculitis may contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric involvement in HCV<pathogen> patients.
