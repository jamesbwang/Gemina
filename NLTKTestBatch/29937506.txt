 We consider a dual-channel supply chain coordination<symptom> under a carbon cap-and-trade regulation. The dual-channel refers to the traditional retail channel and the network direct channel , and both two channels ' selling prices can affect the market demand. We formulate the problem as a supplier-Stackelberg game model and obtain the optimal pricing decisions and corresponding profits in centralized and decentralized systems. We explore the effects of cap-and-trade regulation on optimal decisions and profits. To improve the performance of the decentralized system , we propose online channel price discount and offline channel price discount contracts to coordinate dual-channel supply chain and provide a transfer payment mechanism to make win-win of both sides. Moreover , we investigate how carbon regulation affects the coordination<symptom> performance. Numerical examples illustrate the process to find the appropriate price discount coefficient and show the coordination<symptom> effects of two contracts.
