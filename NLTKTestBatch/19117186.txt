 Î‘im of the study was to determine the effect of mirabegron , used for overactive bladder ( OAB) treatment , on female sexual function. Eighty five sexually active women suffering from overactive bladder were prospectively enrolled in this study. Females were divided into two groups. In Group A ( control) , 48 patients received no treatment and in Group B , 37 patients received mirabegron 50 mg/daily for 3 months. Patients were evaluated with FSFI-Gr at the beginning of the study and again after a period of 3 months. In Group B , there was a significant increase post-treatment compared to baseline ( p < 0.001) in total FSFI ( 20.3 ( 3.8) to 26.6 ( 4.2)) and all domains ( desire: 3.0 ( 1.2) to 4.8 ( 1.2)) , arousal: 3.0 ( 0.8) to 4.8 ( 0.9) , lubrication: 3.9 ( 1.1) to 4.8 ( 1.2) , orgasm: 3.6 ( 0.8) to 4.8 ( 1.0) , satisfaction: 3.2 ( 0.4) to 4.0 ( 0.8) and<symptom> pain<symptom>: 3.2 ( 0.8) to 4.4 ( 1.2)). In Group A , there were no statistically significant changes in pre- and post-observation values. This study is one of the few demonstrating that management of OAB with mirabegron improves female sexual function. TRN ISRCTN17199301 , 20/10/2017 , retrospectively registered.
