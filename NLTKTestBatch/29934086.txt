 Scaphoid fracture nonunion can often lead to pain<symptom> , arthrosis , and disability. While typically the result of delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment , it can sometimes occur even if the initial care was timely and appropriate. Whereas early recognition of acute fractures allows for nonoperative management , nonunions frequently require surgical treatment. Traditionally , this has involved open debridement and bone grafting. However , some publications suggest that certain stable nonunions may be amenable to percutaneous debridement and fixation without formal bone grafting. Although certain characteristics appear to be appropriate indications for such management , well-designed clinical studies are needed to better define them.
