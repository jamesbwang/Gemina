 A set of experiments were conducted in Brazil in a pilot-scale waste stabilization pond ( WSP) system ( a four-maturation-pond series) treating an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket ( UASB) reactor effluent. Over a year and a half the pond series was monitored under two flow rate conditions , hence also different hydraulic retention<symptom> times and surface loading rates. On-site and laboratory trials were carried out to assess: ( i) ammonia<pathogen> losses<symptom> by volatilization using acrylic capture chambers placed at the surface of the ponds; ( ii) organic nitrogen sedimentation rates using metal buckets placed at the bottom of the ponds for collecting settled particulate matter; ( iii) nitrogen removal by algal uptake based on the nitrogen content of the suspended particulate matter in samples from the ponds ' water column. In addition , nitrification and denitrification rates were measured in laboratory-based experiments using pond water and sediment samples. The pond system achieved high nitrogen removal ( 69 % total nitrogen and 92 % ammonia<pathogen> removal). The average total nitrogen removal rates varied from 10,098 to 3,849 g N/ha Â· d in the first and the last ponds , respectively , with the following fractions associated with the various removal pathways: ( i) 23.5-45.6 % sedimentation of organic nitrogen; ( ii) 13.1-27.8 % algal uptake; ( iii) 1.2-3.1 % ammonia<pathogen> volatilization; and ( iv) 0.15-0.34 % nitrification-denitrification.
