 Multidrug-resistant bacteria<pathogen> pose a major threat to effective antibiotics and alternatives to fight multidrug-resistant pathogens are needed. We synthetized molybdenum oxide ( MoO3) nanoparticles ( NP) and determined their antibacterial activity against 39 isolates: ( i) eight Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , including representatives of methicillin-resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> epidemic clones; ( ii) six enterococci , including vancomycin-resistant isolates; and ( iii) 25 Gram-negative isolates ( Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen><disease><symptom> , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> , Enterobacter<pathogen> cloacae<pathogen>) , including extended spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases producers. All isolates showed a MoO3 NP MIC of 700-800 mg l
