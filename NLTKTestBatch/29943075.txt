 Developmental changes in adolescents ' relationships with parents and friends intertwine , but individual differences in these relationships are likely to emerge as not all adolescents develop similarly. Generalized anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> may underlie these individual differences , as these symptoms<symptom> have frequently been associated with interpersonal difficulties. This study examines relationship quality development with parents and friends in adolescents with low and high levels of generalized anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. A latent transition analysis was performed in a two-cohort five-wave study design covering ages 12 to 16 ( n = 923 , 50.8 % males) and 16 to 20 ( n = 390 , 43.4 % males). About one-third of adolescents with high levels of generalized anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> perceived a turbulent relationship with both their parents and best friends , whereas only one-tenth of those with low levels of generalized anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> did. Low levels as opposed to high levels of generalized anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> predicted a twice as high likelihood to perceive harmonious relationships with both their parents and best friends. Nevertheless , adolescents with low and high levels of generalized anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> exhibited similar trends in relationship development. Overall , our findings indicate that generalized anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> are not deterministic markers for relationship difficulties as there were plenty of adolescents with high levels of generalized anxiety<symptom> symptoms<symptom> that experienced no relationship difficulties across adolescence.
