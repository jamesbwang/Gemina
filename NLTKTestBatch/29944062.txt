 The aim of this study was to investigate if hand grip strength ( HGS) is associated with: 1) fatigue<symptom> , and specifically clinically relevant fatigue<symptom> ( CRF); 2) low physical activity; and 3) fatigue<symptom> independent of physical activity level , among individuals with and without COPD. Data were collected from the Obstructive Lung Disease<disease> in Northern Sweden ( OLIN) COPD-study in 2014. HGS was measured with a hand-grip dynamometer , fatigue<symptom> and physical activity were assessed by questionnaires; FACIT-Fatigue respectively IPAQ. Among individuals with COPD ( n = 389) , but not without COPD ( n = 442) , HGS was lower among those with CRF than those without CRF , significantly so among men ( p = 0.001) and close to among women ( p = 0.051). HGS was not associated with physical activity levels within any of the groups. HGS was associated with fatigue<symptom> among men , but not women , with COPD independent of physical activity level , age , height , and smoking habits ( Beta = 0.190 , 95 % CI 0.061-0.319 , respectively Beta = 0.048 , 95 % CI-0.056-0.152) , while there were no corresponding significant findings among individuals without COPD. In summary , HGS was associated with CRF among individuals with COPD in this population-based study. Among men with COPD , HGS was associated with fatigue<symptom> independent of physical activity level and common confounders.
