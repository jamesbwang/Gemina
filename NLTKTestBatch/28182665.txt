 Juvenile idiopathic arthritis<disease><symptom> ( JIA) is one of the most common chronic rheumatic diseases<disease> in children. The complex nature of this immune-mediated disease<disease> owes itself to several predisposing genes and environmental factors affecting its pathogenesis. Conducted in Iran , this study was originally intended to investigate every possible association between HLA DRB1 alleles and a susceptibility to JIA. In this case-control study , 45 patients with a definite diagnosis of JIA based on International League against Rheumatism ( ILAR) criteria were compared against 46 healthy controls. DNA samples taken from both groups were analyzed using PCR-sequence specific primers ( PCR-SSP) method. Data analysis including parametric and nonparametric test and multivariate analysis was undertaken using the SPSS 11.5 software. A Mean ages in case group and healthy controls were 14.64 ± 6.21 and 13.73 ± 6.39 , respectively with no significant difference between the two groups ( HLA-DRB1 * 11 was shown to raise protection to JIA in northeastern Iran. The disparity of findings in other ethnicities prompts further investigations with larger sample sizes.
