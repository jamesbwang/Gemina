 Chronic<symptom> Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> ( CHF) is associated with multi-hormonal derangement depicting a prevalence of catabolic vs. anabolic axes. Moreover , thyroid adaption is characterized by the reduced conversion of thyroxine to the active hormone triiodothyronine. On the other hand , hormones modulate synthesis and utilization of antioxidant systems. Therefore , hormonal failure can cause unbalance between reactive radical species and the defenses , resulting in oxidative stress ( OS). OS is well described in CHF , but the relationship with the hormonal picture is not entirely known. In the present review , we firstly analyze the mechanisms of ROS production in the heart , discussing animal and human studies , and focusing on new discovered protective mechanisms such as sirtuins and fibroblast growth factor 21 ( FGF21). The second section is dedicated to the role of main anabolic axes influencing antioxidant systems. Finally , we present some data supporting the hypothesis that OS could be the link between hormonal derangement and clinical outcome of CHF.
