 Brain inflammation<symptom> is associated with cognitive dysfunction , especially in elderly. Trigonelline is a plant alkaloid and a major component of coffee and fenugreek with anti-diabetic , antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and neuroprotective effects. In this study , the beneficial effect of trigonelline against lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced cognitive decline was assessed in the rat. LPS was injected i.p. at a dose of 500 μg/kg to induce neuroinflammation and trigonelline was administered p.o. at doses of 20 , 40 , or 80 mg/kg/day 1 h after LPS that continued for one week. Trigonelline-treated LPS-challenged rats showed improved spatial recognition memory in Y maze , discrimination ratio in novel object discrimination test , and retention<symptom> and recall in passive avoidance paradigm. Additionally , trigonelline lowered hippocampal malondialdehyde ( MDA) and acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) activity and improved superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , catalase , and glutathione ( GSH). Furthermore , trigonelline depressed hippocampal nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-κB) , toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNF α) in LPS-challenged rats. All of the effects of trigonelline followed a dose-dependent pattern and in some aspects , it acted even better than the routinely-used anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone. Collectively , trigonelline is capable to diminish LPS-induced cognitive decline via suppression of hippocampal oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> and appropriate modulation of NF-κB/TLR4 and AChE activity.
