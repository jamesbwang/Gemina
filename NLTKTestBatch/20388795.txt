 5-Fluorouracil plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin alone or in association with target therapy are standard first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC). Checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/ PD-L1 demonstrated efficacy on mCRC with microsatellite instability but remain ineffective alone in microsatellite stable tumour. 5-Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin were known to present immunogenic properties. Durvalumab ( D) is a human monoclonal antibody ( mAb) that inhibits binding of programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) to its receptor. Tremelimumab ( T) is a mAb directed against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4). This study is designed to evaluate whether the addition of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibition to oxaliplatin , fluorouracil and leucovorin ( FOLFOX) increases treatment efficacy. This phase II study ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03202758) will assess the efficacy and safety of FOLFOX/D/T association in patients with mCRC ( n = 48). Good performance status<symptom> patients ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group < 2) with untreated , RAS mutational status<symptom> mCRC will be eligible. Prior adjuvant therapy is allowed provided recurrence is > 6 months postcompletion. There is a safety lead in nine patients receiving FOLFOX/D/T. Assuming no safety concerns the study will go on to include 39 additional patients. Patients will receive folinic acid ( 400 mg/m ²)/ 5-fluorouracil ( 400 mg/m ² as bolus followed by 2400 mg/m
