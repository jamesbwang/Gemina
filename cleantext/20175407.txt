  Impaired spontaneous regional activity and altered topology of the brain network have been observed in obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA). However , the mechanisms of disrupted functional connectivity ( FC) and topological reorganization of the default mode network ( DMN) in patients with OSA remain largely unknown. We explored whether the FC is altered within the DMN and examined topological changes occur in the DMN in patients with OSA using a graph theory analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and evaluated the relationship between neuroimaging measures and clinical variables. Resting-state data were obtained from 46 male patients with untreated severe OSA and 46 male good sleepers ( GSs). We specifically selected 20 DMN subregions to construct the DMN architecture. The disrupted FC and topological properties of the DMN in patients with OSA were characterized using graph theory. The OSA group showed significantly decreased FC of the anterior-posterior DMN and within the posterior DMN , and also showed increased FC within the DMN. The DMN exhibited small-world topology in both OSA and GS groups. Compared to GSs , patients with OSA showed a decreased clustering coefficient (
