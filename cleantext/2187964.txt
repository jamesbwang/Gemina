  The use of virtual surgical planning and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing has previously been reported to enhance the planning for the reconstruction of mandibular continuity defects and to reduce surgical time. Reported is a case of a large keratocystic odontogenic tumor ( KOT) affecting right hemimandible including the condylar neck. This case was initially reconstructed with a condyle-bearing reconstruction plate , but because of fatigue<symptom> fracture 15 years later , a new reconstruction with a custom-made total joint temporomandibular prosthesis was performed.
