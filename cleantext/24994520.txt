  The IgA nephropathy is the most frequent form of glomerulonephritis<disease> worldwide. In approximately 30 % of patients a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate of approximately 50 % is observed within 10 years. Patients with IgA nephropathy form IgG autoantibodies against galactose-deficient IgA1 antibodies. This results in deposition of these antibodies in the mesangium and activation of complement with mesangial hypercellularity , endocapillary hypercellularity , segmental glomerulosclerosis and atrophying interstitial fibrosis<disease>. The basic treatment for patients with IgA nephropathy consists of removing risk factors , in particular hypertension , with blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Immunosuppressives were also investigated in various studies but a clear advantage was not observed.
