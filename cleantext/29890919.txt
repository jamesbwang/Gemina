  Introduction Cetuximab , a chimeric monoclonal antibody , is a commonly used anticancer drug that prevents binding of epidermal growth factor to epidermal growth factor receptor. It has been widely used in a variety of cancers since its initial approval by the FDA in 2004. Despite its efficacy , it has met with some genuine concerns especially regarding the anaphylactoid reactions occurring after first infusions. Cetuximab-related first infusion reaction has been found to be much more prevalent in the Southeastern United States with several studies from the southern United States supporting it. The purpose of our study was to determine the rate of first infusion reaction in the state of Arkansas and the factors that could predispose to first infusion reaction. Methods and results We performed a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients who received cetuximab between January 2004 and December 2016 at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. We included a total of 220 patients in our analysis out of which 32 ( 14.5 %) developed cetuximab-related first infusion reaction. There was a statistically significant increased risk in males versus females ( 18.2 % vs. 8.4 % , P = 0.045) and trend toward significance for the difference between Caucasians and Blacks ( 16.5 % vs. 7.1 % , P = 0.054). Conclusion There is increased incidence of cetuximab-related first infusion reaction in Arkansas which is much higher than the national average but comparable to the incidence in other neighboring states in the Southeastern United States. This increased incidence tends to cluster in Caucasian males. Safer alternatives should be preferred for treatment of cancers particularly in the Southeastern United States whenever possible.
