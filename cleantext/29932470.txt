  Loss-of-function variants in the MC1R gene cause recessive red or yellow coat-colour phenotypes in many species. The canine MC1R: c. 916C > T ( p.Arg306Ter) variant is widespread and found in a homozygous state in many uniformly yellow- or red-coloured dogs. We investigated cream-coloured Australian Cattle Dogs whose coat colour could not be explained by this variant. A genome-wide association study with 10 cream and 123 red Australian Cattle Dogs confirmed that the cream locus indeed maps to MC1R. Whole-genome sequencing of cream dogs revealed a single nucleotide variant within the MITF binding site of the canine MC1R promoter. We propose to designate the mutant alleles at MC1R: c. 916C > T as e
