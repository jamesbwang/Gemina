  Perilunate fracture dislocations are a rare but devastating injury , which is often missed on initial presentation leading to significant delays in treatment. With the delay in treatment and a high energy mechanism of injury , patients are at increased risk of developing complex regional pain syndrome<disease> following trauma. In this report , we review the case of a 57-year-old left-hand dominant female who presented to a clinic with a five-and-a-half-week-old transtriquetral , perilunate fracture dislocation with comminution of the scaphoid facet. Due to the increased likelihood of a secondary procedure and low probability of a satisfactory outcome with open reduction internal fixation secondary to the loss of the scaphoid articulation , a salvage procedure was deemed her best option. To our knowledge , this is the first case reported in the literature in which a scaphoidectomy , triquetromy , and midcarpal fusion ( three-corner fusion) was performed in the acute setting for a perilunate fracture dislocation.
