  In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the oncogenic mutant KIT/D816V causes transformation of cells , we investigated proteins that selectively bind KIT/D816V , but not wild-type KIT , as potential mediators of transformation. By mass spectrometry several proteins were identified , among them a previously uncharacterized protein denoted XKR5 ( XK-related protein 5) , which is related to the X Kell blood group proteins. We could demonstrate that interaction between XKR5 and KIT/D816V leads to phosphorylation of XKR5 at Tyr 369 , Tyr487 , and Tyr 543. Tyrosine phosphorylated XKR5 acts as a negative regulator of KIT signaling , which leads to downregulation of phosphorylation of ERK , AKT , and p38. This led to reduced proliferation and colony forming capacity in semi-solid medium. Taken together , our data demonstrate that XKR5 is a novel type of negative regulator of KIT-mediated transformation.
