  Molecular conformation , intermolecular interaction , and electrode-molecule contacts greatly affect charge transport in molecular junctions and interfacial properties of organic devices by controlling the molecular orbital alignment. Here , we statistically investigated the charge transport in molecular junctions containing self-assembled oligophenylene molecules sandwiched between an Au probe tip and graphene according to various tip-loading forces ( F
