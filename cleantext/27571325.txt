  Counterintuitive to anatomic organization is the communication between a dorsal ramus and a ventral ramus , which are traditionally taught as serving specific anatomical fields. Herein , we discuss the cadaveric findings of such an example of neural intercommunication between the dorsal and ventral rami and review the potential embryology. While these two nerves are complementary in their function , it is not understood as to the reason for such an anatomical connection that breaches normal anatomical `` laws. ''
