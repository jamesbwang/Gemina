  Diabetic retinopathy ( DR) and glaucoma are emerging causes of blindness<symptom> and visual impairment in India and the world. Both diseases do not have any early warning symptoms , and once the symptoms appear , the diseases are reasonably advanced. Because of the long-standing nature of the diseases , one can not adopt the cataract detection and treatment model so successfully developed in India. It requires an altogether different approach for screening and related infrastructure including human capital development. The solutions developed to reduce the burden of DR/glaucoma should be customized to urban , semi-urban , and rural areas. Greater advocacy , improving the health-seeking behavior , development of infrastructure and skilled personnel appropriate for the points of care , and an emphasis in comprehensive eye care are some of the solutions.
