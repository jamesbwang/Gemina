  The ability of blood levels of interleukin ( IL) -6 to differentiate between infection and non-infection in critically ill patients with suspected infection is unclear. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of serum IL-6 levels for the diagnosis of infection in critically ill patients. We systematically searched the PubMed , MEDLINE , Cochrane Resister of Controlled Trials , Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , CINAHL , and Igaku Chuo Zasshi databases for studies published from 1986 to August 2016 that evaluated the accuracy of IL-6 levels for the diagnosis of infection. We constructed 2 Ã— 2 tables and calculated summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity using a bivariate random-effects model. The literature search identified 775 articles , six of which with a total of 527 patients were included according to the predefined criteria. The pooled sensitivity , specificity , and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.73 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.61-0.82) , 0.76 ( 95 % CI , 0.61-0.87) , and 2.31 ( 95 % CI , 1.20-3.48) , respectively. The area under the curve ( AUC) of the summary receiver operator characteristic ( SROC) curve was 0.81 ( 95 % CI , 0.78-0.85). In the secondary analysis of two studies with a total of 263 adult critically ill patients with organ dysfunction , the pooled sensitivity , specificity , and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.81 ( 95 % CI , 0.75-0.86) , 0.77 ( 95 % CI , 0.67-0.84) , and 2.87 ( 95 % CI 2.15-3.60) , respectively. Blood levels of IL-6 have a moderate diagnostic value and a potential clinical utility to differentiate infection in critically ill patients with suspected infection.
