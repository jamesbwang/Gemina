  Estetrol ( E4) is a natural estrogen synthesized exclusively during pregnancy by the human fetal liver , and the physiological role of this hormone is unknown. Interestingly , E4 was recently evaluated in preclinical and phase II-III clinical studies in combination with a progestin , with the advantage to not increase the circulating level of coagulation factors , at variance to oral estradiol or ethinylestradiol. Here , we evaluated the effect of E4 on hemostasis and thrombosis in mouse. Following chronic E4 treatment , mice exhibited a prolonged tail-bleeding time and were protected from arterial and also venous thrombosis in vivo. In addition , E4 treatment decreased ex vivo thrombus growth on collagen under arterial flow conditions. We recently showed that E4 activates uterine epithelial proliferation through nuclear estrogen receptor ( ER) α. To analyze the impact of nuclear ERα actions on hemostasis and thrombosis , we generated hematopoietic chimera with bone<disease> marrow cells deficient for nuclear ERα. E4-induced protection against thromboembolism was significantly reduced in the absence of hematopoietic nuclear ERα activation , while the increased tail-bleeding time was not impacted by this deletion. In addition to its `` liver friendly '' profile described in women , our data shows that E4 has anti-thrombotic properties in various mouse models. Altogether , the natural fetal estrogen E4 could represent an attractive alternative to classic estrogens in oral contraception and treatment of menopause.
