  GATE/GEANT is a Monte Carlo code dedicated to nuclear medicine that allows calculation of the dose to organs ( bone and bone<disease> marrow) of voxel phantoms. On the other hand , Medical Internal Radiation Dose ( MIRD) is a well-developed system for estimation of the dose to human organs. In this study , results obtained from GATE/GEANT using leg of Snyder phantom is compared to published MIRD data. For this , the mathematical leg of Snyder phantom was discretized and converted to a digital phantom of 100 × 100 × 200 voxels. The activity was considered uniformly distributed within bone and bone<disease> marrow. The GATE/GEANT Monte Carlo code was used to calculate the dose to the bone and bone<disease> marrow of the leg phantom from mono-energetic photons of 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , and 1000 keV. The dose was converted into a specific absorbed fraction ( SAF) and the results were compared to the corresponding published MIRD data. On average , there was a good correlation between the two series of data for self-absorption ( r In this study , the SAF values derived from GATE/GEANT and the corresponding MIRD published data were compared. On average , the SAF values derived with GATE/GEANT showed an acceptable correlation and agreement with the MIRD data for the photon energies of 50-1000 keV. For photons of 10-30 keV , there was an only poor agreement between the GATE/GEANT results and MIRD data.
