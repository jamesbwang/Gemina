  Climate change models predict temporal and spatial shifts in precipitation resulting in more frequent incidents of flooding , particularly in regions with poor soil drainage. In these flooding conditions , crop losses are inevitable due to exposure of plants to hypoxia and the spread of root rot diseases. Improving the tolerance of bean cultivars to flooding is crucial to minimize crop losses. In this experiment , we evaluated the phenotypic responses of 277 genotypes from the Andean Diversity Panel to flooding at germination and seedling stages. A randomized complete block design , with a split plot arrangement , was employed for phenotyping germination rate , total weight , shoot weight , root weight , hypocotyl length , SPAD index , adventitious root rate , and survival score. A subset of genotypes (
