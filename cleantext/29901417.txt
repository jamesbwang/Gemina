  SIRT6 is a main regulator of metabolism and lifespan and its importance has been implicated in the prevention against aging-related diseases. The objective of this study was to examine the application of multivariate longitudinal models in SIRT6 , FBS , and BMI analysis in the elderly men after eight weeks concurrent training with supplementation of l-arginine ( l-Arg). Thirty two elderly men with mean age of 63.09 ± 3.71 years were randomly divided into four equal-sized groups ( each n = 8); Exercise + supplement ( ES) group; exercise + placebo ( EP) group; supplement ( S) group and control ( C) group. The ES and EP groups performed the eight weeks of concurrent training , three sessions per week. Group ES and group S consumed 1000 mg of l-Arg per day at 8:00 pm. Measurements of biochemical variables were done by ELISA Reader method. For analytical purposes , we used the paired sample t-test and multivariate longitudinal modeling with generalized estimating equation ( GEE) methodology. All analyses have been implemented in R-3.4.1. p Values less than .05 were considered statistically significant. With respect to significant association between sirt6 , FBS , and BMI , this study showed that synergy effect of training and supplementation was greater than the sum of their individual effects on SIRT6 ( β = 0.79 , p < .001) , FBS ( β = -5.56 , p = .022) , and BMI ( β = -3.89; p = .041). Also exercise alone had a significantly larger effect than supplementation alone on responses. It can be concluded that the joint usage of concurrent training and supplement of l-Arg for elderly men could improve the metabolism and body composition.
