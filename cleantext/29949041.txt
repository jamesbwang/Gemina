  Two 52-week Phase III studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily combinations of empagliflozin/linagliptin as monotherapy or add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM). The aim of this analysis was to further assess the safety and tolerability of empagliflozin/linagliptin compared with their individual components in patients with T2DM , using pooled data from these trials. A total of 1363 patients were treated with empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg ( n = 273) , empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg ( n = 272) , empagliflozin 25 mg ( n = 276) , empagliflozin 10 mg ( n = 275) , or linagliptin 5 mg ( n = 267). Adverse events ( AEs) were assessed descriptively in patients who took ≥ 1 dose of study drug. Total exposure was 251 , 255 , 256 , 249 , and 243 patient-years in the empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg , empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg , empagliflozin 25 mg , empagliflozin 10 mg , and linagliptin 5 mg groups , respectively. The proportion of patients with ≥ 1 AE was similar across groups ( 70.4-74.9 %). The percentage of patients with confirmed hypoglycemic AEs ( plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL and/or requiring assistance) was low in all groups ( 1.1-2.2 %); none required assistance. Events consistent with urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> were reported in similar percentages of patients in all groups ( 11.4-13.8 %) , and in a greater proportion of female than male patients. Events consistent with genital<disease> infection<disease> were reported in higher percentages of patients on empagliflozin/linagliptin or empagliflozin ( 4.0-6.5 %) than linagliptin 5 mg ( 2.6 %) , and in a greater proportion of females than males. The risks of hypersensitivity<disease> reactions and events consistent with volume depletion were low across treatment groups. Empagliflozin/linagliptin as monotherapy or add-on to metformin for 52 weeks was well tolerated in patients with T2DM , with safety profiles similar to individual components , including a low risk of hypoglycemia.
