  Some groups have avoided early microsurgical flaps in electrical burns under the pretext of injury to the microvasculature , which could increase vascular thrombosis. However , this option frequently results in amputation of the extremity. This study aims to evaluate the early application of microsurgical flaps for the treatment of electrical burns of extremities. A case series was retrospectively evaluated including patients with electrical trauma in extremities undergoing early microsurgical reconstruction. Data were obtained from medical charts , including age , trauma location , flap type and microvascular anastomosis , the need for other procedures , postoperative complications , the length of hospital stay after the flap surgery , and patient outcomes. Five microsurgical flaps were performed in less than 30 days to trauma , one anterolateral thigh flap to cover skin<symptom> failure<symptom> in upper limb , and four radial forearm flaps to cover failure in feet. The patient ages had a mean of 25.8 years ( from 12 to 42 years). The microsurgical procedure occurred from 21 to 27 days after the burn , with a mean of 24.2 days. Hospital discharge had a mean of 26.6 days ( from 19 to 35 days after the surgery). Only one patient required reintervention for re-anastomosis. All patients had a good flap viability , avoiding amputation of the affected extremity and with a proper preservation of function. The early application of microsurgical flaps for patients with electrical burns of extremities may provide adequate , sturdy , and stable skin coverage , contributing to the treatment of noble structures exposed and avoiding amputation of the extremities.
