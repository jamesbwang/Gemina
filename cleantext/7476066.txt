  The aim of this study was to determine the acute effect of static stretching on hamstring and quadriceps muscles ' isokinetic strength when applied for various durations to elite athletes , to investigate the effect of different static stretching durations on isokinetic strength , and finally to determine the optimal stretching duration. Fifteen elite male athletes from two different sport branches ( 10 football and five basketball) participated in this study. Experimental protocol was designed as 17 repetitive static stretching exercises for hamstring and quadriceps muscle groups according to the indicated experimental protocols; ( ( A) 5 min jogging; ( B) 5 min jogging followed by 15 s static stretching; ( C) 5 min jogging followed by 30 s static stretching; ( D) 5 min jogging , followed by static stretching for 45 s). Immediately after each protocol , an isokinetic strength test consisting of five repetitions at 60 °/ s speed and 20 repetitions at 180 °/ s speed was recorded for the right leg by the Isomed 2000 device. Friedman variance analysis test was employed for data analysis. According to the analyzes , it was observed that 5 min jogging and 15 s stretching exercises increased the isokinetic strength , whereas 30 and 45 s stretching exercises caused a decrease.
