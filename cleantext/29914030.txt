  Hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a key pathology in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , frontotemporal dementia , chronic traumatic encephalopathy , and Parkinson 's disease. The essential trace element zinc exacerbates tauopathy in vitro as well as in a Drosophila model of AD. However , the interaction has never been assessed behaviorally or biochemically in mammals. Zinc supplementation is prevalent in society , finding use as a treatment for macular degeneration and cataracts , and is also taken as an immune system booster with high levels appearing in multivitamins marketed toward the elderly. Using a transgenic mouse model that contains the human gene for tau protein ( P301L) , we assessed the effects of excess chronic zinc supplementation on tau pathology. Behavioral tests included nest building , circadian rhythm , Morris Water Maze , fear conditioning , and open field. Biochemically , total tau and Ser396 phosphorylation were assessed using western blot. Number of tangles were assessed by Thioflavin-S and free zinc levels were assessed by Zinpyr-1. Tau mice demonstrated behavioral deficits compared to control mice. Zinc supplementation exacerbated tauopathic deficits in circadian rhythm , nesting behavior , and Morris Water Maze. Biochemically , zinc-supplemented tau mice showed increased phosphorylation at pSer396. Zinc supplementation in tau mice also increased tangle numbers in the hippocampus while decreasing free-zinc levels , demonstrating that tangles were sequestering zinc. These results show that zinc intensified the deficits in behavior and biochemistry caused by tau.
