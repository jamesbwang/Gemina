  Retrorectal cysts<symptom> make up a small but challenging group of pelvic masses , especially if they extend high into the pelvis. We present a case of successful robotic removal of a large retrorectal cyst<symptom>. Video presentation of a robotic excision of a retrorectal mass. We present a case of robotic removal of a large retrorectal mass extending up to the S3 vertebra. Robotic approach is a very useful tool for successful removal of large pelvic masses that can not be removed by traditional posterior or trans perineal approach.
