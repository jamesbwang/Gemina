  Extra-cellular signal regulated kinase ( ERK)/ mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signaling pathway is widely involved in cell proliferation , apoptosis , and drug resistance. MAPK kinase 1 ( MEK1) is the upstream protein kinase of ERK that can activate ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. microRNA 203 ( MiR-203) down-regulation is found to be associated with prostate cancer pathogenesis. Bioinformatics analysis showed the complementary targeted relationship between miR-203 and the 3 '- UTR of MEK1 mRNA. This study explored the role of miR-203 in regulating prostate cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , and ADM resistance through affecting MEK1 expression. Dual luciferase assay confirmed the targeted relationship between miR-203 and MEK1. MiR-203 , MEK1 , p-ERK1/ 2 , and B cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2) expressions were compared in normal prostate epithelial cells PrEC , prostate cancer cells PC-3M , and drug resistance cells PC-3M/ ADM. PC-3M , PC-3M/ ADM cell apoptosis and proliferation were detected by using flow cytometry under ADM treatment at IC50 concentration of PC-3M cells. PC-3M cells were cultured in vitro and divided into four groups , including microRNA-normal control ( miR-NC) , miR-203 mimic , small interfere NC ( si-NC) , and si-MEK1. MiR-203 targeted and inhibited MEK1 expression. MiR-203 levels and cell apoptosis were significantly lower , while MEK1 , p-ERK1/ 2 , Bcl-2 , and cell proliferation were significantly higher in PC-3M/ ADM cells compared to the PC-3M cells. MiR-203 mimic and/or si-MEK1 transfection significantly reduced MEK1 , p-ERK1/ 2 , and Bcl-2 levels , attenuated cell proliferation , induced cell apoptosis , and decreased drug resistance. MiR-203 elevation suppressed prostate cancer PC-3M cell proliferation , promoted apoptosis , and weakened ADM resistance through targeted inhibiting MEK1 expression to alleviate ERK/MAPK signaling pathway and Bcl-2 expression.
