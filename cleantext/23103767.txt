  During an adaptive immune response , B cells can change their surface immunoglobulins from IgM to IgG , IgE or IgA through a process called class switch recombination ( CSR). Switching is preceded by inducible non-coding germline transcription ( GLT) of the selected constant gene ( s) , which is largely controlled by a super-enhancer called the 3 ' regulatory region ( 3 ` RR). Despite intense efforts , the precise mechanisms that regulate GLT are still elusive. In order to gain additional insights into these mechanisms , we analyzed GLT and CSR in mutant B cells carrying a duplication of the promoter of the α constant gene ( Iα) downstream of 3 ` RR. Duplication of the Iα promoter affected differently GLT and CSR. While for most isotypes a drop in GLT was accompanied by a decrease in CSR , that was not the case for switching to IgA , which diminished despite unchanged GLT. Unexpectedly , there was no obvious effect on GLT and CSR to IgG3. Remarkably , specific stimuli that normally induce switching to IgG2b had contrasting effects in mutant B cells; Iγ2b was now preferentially responsive to the stimulus that induced Iα promoter. We propose that one mechanism underlying the induced 3 ` RR-mediated activation of GL promoters involves , at least in part , specific transcription factories.
