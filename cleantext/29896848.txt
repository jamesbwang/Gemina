  Plants interact simultaneously with each other and with soil biota , yet the relative importance of competition vs. plant-soil feedback ( PSF) on plant performance is poorly understood. Using a meta-analysis of 38 published studies and 150 plant species , we show that effects of interspecific competition ( either growing plants with a competitor or singly , or comparing inter- vs. intraspecific competition) and PSF ( comparing home vs. away soil , live vs. sterile soil , or control vs. fungicide-treated soil) depended on treatments but were predominantly negative , broadly comparable in magnitude , and additive or synergistic. Stronger competitors experienced more negative PSF than weaker competitors when controlling for density ( inter- to intraspecific competition) , suggesting that PSF could prevent competitive dominance and promote coexistence. When competition was measured against plants growing singly , the strength of competition overwhelmed PSF , indicating that the relative importance of PSF may depend not only on neighbour identity but also density. We evaluate how competition and PSFs might interact across resource gradients; PSF will likely strengthen competitive interactions in high resource environments and enhance facilitative interactions in low-resource environments. Finally , we provide a framework for filling key knowledge gaps and advancing our understanding of how these biotic interactions influence community structure.
