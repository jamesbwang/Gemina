  The increasing requirement to produce platform chemicals and fuels from renewable sources means advances in biocatalysis are rapidly becoming a necessity. Biomass is widely used in nature as a source of energy and as chemical building blocks. However , recalcitrance towards traditional chemical processes and solvents provides a significant barrier to widespread utility. Here , by optimizing enzyme solubility in ionic liquids , we have discovered solvent-induced substrate promiscuity of glucosidase , demonstrating an unprecedented example of homogeneous enzyme bioprocessing of cellulose. Specifically , chemical modification of glucosidase for solubilization in ionic liquids can increase thermal stability to up to 137 Â°C , allowing for enzymatic activity 30 times greater than is possible in aqueous media. These results establish that through a synergistic combination of chemical biology ( enzyme modification) and reaction engineering ( solvent choice) , the biocatalytic capability of enzymes can be intensified: a key step towards the full-scale deployment of industrial biocatalysis.
