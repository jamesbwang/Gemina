  Heterogeneity is a hallmark feature of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. Following infection , naive T cells differentiate into various subsets of effector and memory T cells , which help to eliminate pathogens and maintain long-term immunity. The current model suggests there is a single lineage of naive T cells that give rise to different populations of effector and memory T cells depending on the type and amounts of stimulation they encounter during infection. Here , we have discovered that multiple sub-populations of cells exist in the naive CD8
