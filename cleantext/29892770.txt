  Plant proteins are often characterized by low solubilities and impaired functionalities e.g. emulsifying properties. In products like milk substitutes , these protein properties are of great importance to ensure good product quality. In this study proteolytic enzymes were used as a tool to increase protein solubility and alter their properties gently. A plant-based milk substitute based on quinoa was produced and treated with different enzymes. One Î±-amylase and three commercial proteases were selected: Hitempase 2XP , Profix 100L , Bioprotease N100L , and Flavourzyme 1000L. The protein solubility of the samples was initially low with 48.02 % and was improved with the increasing degree of hydrolysis up to a value of 75.82 % for Profix. These results were supported by SDS-PAGE and circular dichroism analysis: especially Profix degraded the proteins extensively. Quality characteristics , such as foaming , and emulsifying properties were not influenced considerably by the protease treatment. The results of this study provide an in-depth understanding of the effects of different enzymes in a complex system of a plant-based milk substitute and contribute to the development of protein based products.
