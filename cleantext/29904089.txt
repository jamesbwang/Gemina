  The mutational spectrum and prognostic stratification of intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( IR-AML) , which accounts for a substantial number of AML , are unclear. In order to explore the prognostic significance of the mutational spectrum in IR-AML , 106 IR-AML patients were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Sixty-two patients underwent chemotherapy-only , forty-four proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT). Fifty-five patients had more than five recurrent genetic mutations. NPM1 had the highest mutation frequency , followed by DNMT3A , FLT3 , RUNX1 , IDH2 , IDH1 , and TET2. In all patients , allo-HSCT was an independent favorable factor for EFS and OS ( P = 0.036 , P = 0.001 , respectively); age ≥ 60 years , FLT3-ITD and mutations in DNMT3A and RUNX1 were independent risk factors for survival ( all P < 0.05). In the chemotherapy-only group , multivariate analysis showed that age ≥ 60 years was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS ( P = 0.008 , P = 0.017 , respectively). In the allo-HSCT group , multivariate analysis indicated that MLL-PTD was an independent risk fact for EFS ( P = 0.037) , FLT3-ITD and RUNX1 mutations independently contributed to poor OS ( P = 0.035 , P = 0.014 , respectively). In conclusion , older age was an important risk factor for IR-AML patients undergoing chemotherapy-only; FLT3-ITD , MLL-PTD and RUNX1 mutations were significant risk factors for IR-AML patients who received allo-HSCT.
