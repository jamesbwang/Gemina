  Molecular maps of the human brain alone do not inform us of the features unique to humans. Yet , the identification of these features is important for understanding both the evolution and nature of human cognition. Here , we approached this question by analyzing gene expression and H3K27ac chromatin modification data collected in eight brain regions of humans , chimpanzees , gorillas , a gibbon , and macaques. An analysis of spatial transcriptome trajectories across eight brain regions in four primate species revealed 1851 genes showing human-specific transcriptome differences in one or multiple brain regions , in contrast to 240 chimpanzee-specific differences. More than half of these human-specific differences represented elevated expression of genes enriched in neuronal and astrocytic markers in the human hippocampus , whereas the rest were enriched in microglial markers and displayed human-specific expression in several frontal cortical regions and the cerebellum. An analysis of the predicted regulatory interactions driving these differences revealed the role of transcription factors in species-specific transcriptome changes , and epigenetic modifications were linked to spatial expression differences conserved across species.
