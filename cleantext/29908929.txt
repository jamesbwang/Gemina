  To evaluate the association between alignment , as determined by plain radiographs , and patient-reported outcome in adults with a displaced distal radius fracture. We also determined which specific radiological parameters are associated with patient-reported outcomes. We performed a systematic literature search to identify studies that evaluated the association between radiological and patient-reported outcome in adults with a displaced distal radius fracture and who had an average follow-up of at least 12 months. Radiological outcome was determined as acceptable or unacceptable reduction , defined by radiological parameters. Patient-reported outcome was assessed with the Disability of the Arm , Shoulder , and Hand , the Quick-Disability of the Arm , Shoulder , and Hand , and the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation questionnaires. Sixteen articles were included , comprising 1,961 patients with a distal radius fracture. A significant mean difference of 4.15 points in patient-reported outcomes ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.26-8.04) was found in favor of an acceptable radiological reduction. Moreover , a significant mean difference of 5.38 points in patient-reported outcomes ( 95 % CI , 1.69-9.07) was found in favor of an acceptable dorsal angulation , and 6.72 points ( 95 % CI , 2.16-11.29) in favor of an acceptable ulnar variance. An unacceptable radiological reduction is significantly associated with worse patient-reported outcomes in adults with a displaced distal radius fracture. Dorsal angulation and ulnar variance are the most important radiological parameters. Despite the statistical significance , the mean difference of each association did not meet the threshold of the minimally clinically important difference and therefore were unlikely to be clinically important.
