  Thyroid hormone has profound effects on skeletal development and adult bone maintenance. Here , we review the current literature concerning thyroid hormone action in bone and cartilage in relation to human<disease> disease<disease> and animal models. We describe state-of-the-art imaging and biomechanical methods used to determine structural and functional parameters in the skeletal phenotyping of mouse models.
