  In order to address acetabular defects , porous metal revision acetabular components and augments have been developed , which require fixation to each other. The fixation technique that results in the smallest relative movement between the components , as well as its influence on the primary stability with the host bone , have not previously been determined. A total of 18 composite hemipelvises with a Paprosky IIB defect were implanted using a porous titanium 56 mm multihole acetabular component and 1 cm augment. Each acetabular component and augment was affixed to the bone using two screws , while the method of fixation between the acetabular component and augment varied for the three groups of six hemipelvises: group S , screw fixation only; group SC , screw plus cement fixation; group C , cement fixation only. The implanted hemipelvises were cyclically loaded to three different loading maxima ( 0.5 kN , 0.9 kN , and 1.8 kN). Screw fixation alone resulted in up to three times more movement ( p = 0.006) , especially when load was increased to 100 % ( p < 0.001) , than with the other two fixation methods ( C and SC). No significant difference was noted when a screw was added to the cement fixation. Increased load resulted in increased relative movement between the interfaces in all fixation methods ( p < 0.001). Cement fixation between a porous titanium acetabular component and augment is associated with less relative movement than screw fixation alone for all implant interfaces , particularly with increasing loads. Adding a screw to the cement fixation did not offer any significant advantage. These results also show that the stability of the tested acetabular component/augment interface affects the stability of the construct that is affixed to the bone.
