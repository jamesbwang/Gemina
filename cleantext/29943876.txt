  To conduct a comprehensive analysis of surf lifeguards ' real and perceived ability in paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) , knowledge of child resuscitation protocols and technical competency during a simulated CPR scenario. Surf lifeguards aged 16 years and over were invited to complete a written survey and simulated test of five cycles of single-rescuer CPR on a paediatric manikin. In accordance with the latest Australia and New Zealand Committee on Resuscitation ( ANZCOR) guidelines , practical skills were assessed by trained observers. A manikin fitted with electronic data-collection capability recorded technical compression and ventilation skills. A total of 244 participants were entered into the study. Most previous CPR training did not include a paediatric component ( 53 %). Lifeguards rated their ability to perform CPR on an adult as ` highly effective ' or ` effective ' in 56 % of responses. Less than a quarter ( 23 %) , however , gave this response when compared to a child. Observed CPR skills were mostly compliant with ANZCOR guidelines ( 80-99 %). Manikin data provided a median compression rate of 115.6 min Surf lifeguards are less confident in paediatric CPR. The overall performance of observed and technical CPR skills , which were mostly ANZCOR guideline compliant , suggests that performance could be improved if paediatric-specific training is provided to supplement the adult-focused methods currently in use. The use of electronic feedback manikins is recommended to address the technical compression and ventilation issues identified in this study.
