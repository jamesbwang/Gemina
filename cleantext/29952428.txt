  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) plays important roles in the metastasis of solid tumors. In this study , the effect of toosendanin ( TSN) , a natural insecticide extracted from Melia toosendan Sieb et Zucc , on transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1)- induced EMT was investigated. EMT was induced by TGF-β1 in A549 and H1975 lung cancer cells. The morphological alterations were observed with a microscopy. The protein expression and localization of EMT biomarkers were determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. The migration , invasion , and adhesion were determined by wound-healing , transwell , and adhesion assays. TGF-β1 treatment induced spindle-shaped alterations of cells , upregulation of N-cadherin , Vimentin , p-ERK1/ 2 , and downregulation of E-cadherin. The abilities of migration , invasion , and adhesion were also enhanced. These effects were significantly reversed by TSN at very low concentration ( < 10 nM). Furthermore , silence Snail significantly reversed TGF-β1-induced EMT biomarkers. In addition , TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 without affecting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and Jun N-terminal kinase. PD98059 and U0126 , inhibitors of ERK1/2 , showed similar inhibitory effect to that of TSN. In summary , TSN significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT and migration , invasion , and adhesion through ERK/Snail pathway in lung cancer cells. This study provides novel anticancer effects and molecular mechanisms for TSN.
