  AXL has been defined as a novel target for cancer therapeutics. However , only a few potent and selective inhibitors targeting AXL are available to date. Our group has developed a lead compound , 9im , capable of excellent inhibition against AXL. With the aim of understanding its cellular and tissue mechanism of actions and direct subsequent structure optimization , a study on competitive affinity-based proteome profiling and bioimaging was carried out. A series of unknown cellular and tissue targets , including RYK , PCK , ATP1A3 , EIF4A , Ptprn and Cox5b were discovered. In addition , trans-cyclooctene ( TCO) and acedan-containing probes were developed to image the binding between 9im and its target proteins inside live cells and tumor tissues. These probes would be useful tools in the detection of expression and activity of AXL.
