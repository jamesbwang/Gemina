  The purpose of revascularization in lower extremity arterial occlusive disease is to prevent amputation and improve walking ability. Many surgical techniques for peripheral vascular disease ( PAD) have been reported. The hybrid operation composed of open surgery and endovascular procedure has been increasingly used for multilevel revascularization. The goal of this study is to evaluate feasibility of simultaneous hybrid femoral endarterectomy and endovascular treatment in patients who need multilevel revascularization with critical limb ischemia. Between March 2011 and July 2014 , 38 consecutive patients ( 43 limbs) with multilevel peripheral arterial disease in critical limb ischemia were treated by simultaneous hybrid operation by single surgeon. The hybrid operation which combines common femoral artery endarterectomy and additive interventional procedure was simultaneously performed for multilevel revascularization. The measurements of primary outcome were primary patency rates , secondary patency rates , and limb salvage rates. Patients who underwent single procedure of surgery or intervention were excluded. The mean age was 72.48 years old and 92.1 % were male. The primary and secondary patency rates at 24 months were 67.3 and 72.1 % , respectively. The preoperative mean ABI of 0.51 ± 0.27 increased to postoperative mean ABI of 0.88 ± 0.35. The limb salvage rate was 95.3 %. Major amputation was performed in 2 out of 43 limbs. There was no early postoperative mortality. The simultaneous hybrid operation for multilevel revascularization may be feasible to treat in multilevel PAD with high technical success and limb salvage rates , thus providing an attractive alternative to larger open surgery or endovascular procedures.
