  Suspension training is an adjunct to traditional strength and conditioning. The effect of added instability on muscle activation during traditional exercises is unclear and depends on the exercise and type of instability. The purpose of this review was to compare the activations of different muscles in suspension training exercises and their traditional counterparts. A search of the current literature was performed without language restrictions using the electronic databases PubMed ( 1969-12 January 2017) , SPORTDiscus ( 1969-12 January 2017) and Scopus ( 1969-12 January 2017). The inclusion criteria were: ( 1) descriptive studies; ( 2) physically active participants; and ( 3) studies that analysed muscle activation using normalised electromyographic signals during different suspension training exercises. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. For the push-up , inverted row , prone bridge and hamstring curl in suspension , the activation of upper-body and core muscles ranged between moderate ( 21-40 % maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC)) and very high ( > 60 % MVIC). Muscle activation in these same muscle groups was greater with suspension exercises relative to comparable traditional exercises , except for the inverted row. Muscle activation in the upper extremity and core muscles varied greatly amongst studies.
