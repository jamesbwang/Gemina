  The critical importance of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) as oncogene activators and essential secondary messengers in cancer cell survival have been widely reported. Since oxidative stress has been implicated as being pivotal in various cancers , antioxidant therapy seems an apt strategy to abrogate ROS-mediated cellular processes to attenuate cancers. We therefore synthesized ROS scavenging nitroxide radical-containing nanoparticles ( RNPs); pH insensitive RNP
