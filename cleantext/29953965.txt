  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) , a novel class of important gene-regulatory molecules , correlates with tumor growth , invasion , metastasis , and chemo resistance in gastric cancer ( GC). Microarray analysis revealed that aberrant expressed microRNA-17 ( miR-17) and DEDD were identified in GC. DEDD has been found to act as an endogenous suppressor of tumor growth and metastasis through epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) process. However , the role of miRNA-17 ( miR-17) has not been clearly evaluated in GC , thereby a series of in vitro experiments were performed in this study. The levels of miR-17 and DEDD in GC tissues from patients diagnosed with GC and in five GC cell lines ( SGC-7901 , MKN-45 , HGC-27 , BGC823 , and AGS) were detected. It was found that miR-17 up-regulated and DEDD down-regulated in GC , and SGC-7901 and AGS cells were adopted for the in vitro cell experiments , in which the expression of miR-17 or DEDD was regulated by transfection. DEDD was validated to be a target gene of miR-17. Inhibition of miR-17 impaired EMT in GC cells. In addition , transwell assay and scratch test results revealed that inhibition of miR-17 hindered GC cell invasion and migration. Moreover , inhibition of miR-17 reduced resistance to cisplatin- or 5-Fu in GC cells and induced cisplatin- or 5-Fu-treated GC cell apoptosis , which evaluated by using CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays. From the short review above , the key findings emerge that inhibition of miR-17 may have tumor suppressive effects on GC and enhance its chemosensitivity by promoting DEDD , highlighting a novel target for GC therapy.
