  Observation with close follow-up ( `` watch and wait '') is a recognized treatment option in patients who achieve a complete clinical response to long course chemoradiotherapy. This review of a prospective database aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes among patients with a complete clinical response managed with observation. A prospective study of 32 patients who achieved a complete clinical response was undertaken. The primary outcomes measured were overall and recurrence-free survival , and rate of organ preservation in patients who deferred immediate surgery. Seven patients developed local regrowth over a median follow-up period of 38 months ( range , 9-91 months). Median time to detection was 12 months. All seven underwent salvage surgery with complete surgical clearance. One patient developed combined local and systemic recurrence following a low anterior resection. Organ preservation was possible in 25 ( 78 %) patients who sustained a complete clinical response with no evidence of local regrowth or disease recurrence. Among the patients who sustained a complete response , two developed isolated systemic<disease> disease<disease>. Overall and recurrence-free survival was 95.7 % and 87.0 % , respectively. The majority of patients with rectal cancer who achieved a complete clinical response after chemoradiotherapy and managed with a `` watch and wait '' approach preserved their rectum and did not develop cancer relapse. Salvage surgery was achieved in all patients who developed local regrowth. The study supports a period of observation in rectal cancer patients who achieve a complete clinical response.
