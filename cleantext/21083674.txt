  Primary biliary cholangitis ( PBC) is an autoimmune inflammatory liver disease of the interlobular bile ducts that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Until recently , the only effective treatment was ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA). However , up to 40 % of PBC patients have an inadequate response to UDCA and may continue to have disease progression. Several models have been developed , including the UK-PBC and GLOBE scores , to assist in identifying patients who may benefit from second-line therapies , such as the farnesoid X receptor ( FXR) agonist obeticholic acid ( OCA). The addition of OCA can significantly improve serum alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin , which are strong surrogate markers of clinical outcomes in PBC. Other alternatives , including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR)- α agonists fenofibrate and bezafibrate , may also improve liver biochemistries in PBC patients with an inadequate response to UDCA , but further study is needed to demonstrate their safety and long-term efficacy. Other novel agents , including those targeting the FXR pathway and PPAR-δ agonists , have shown promising results and may alter the therapeutic landscape of PBC in the near future. For now , OCA remains the only approved second-line agent for PBC patients with an inadequate response to UDCA while results of long-term studies of its safety and clinical benefit are awaited.
