  This observational clinical study investigated patients ' experiences with and opinions on the Dutch ` Screening of Distress and Referral Need ' ( SDRN) process implemented in oncology practice. Insight into these can guide improvement of the SDRN process. Patients from hospitals that had implemented SDRN for at least a year completed questions on experiences with essential SDRN process steps ( 1: completion of the Distress Thermometer and Problem List as screening instrument ( DT&PL) , 2: information on SDRN+DT&PL , 3: information on referral options , 4: discussing DT&PL responses , 5: referral when needed) , and on opinions about SDRN and DT&PL. Descriptive and univariate analyses were conducted. Of the 498 participants ( response = 54 %) , 81 % completed a DT&PL , of whom 86-87 % was exposed to steps 2-3 and 76 % discussed responses; only three needing care were not offered referral. Sixty-one percent encountered all SDRN steps and 78 % would recommend SDRN to others. Recommending SDRN is related to more frequent DT&PL completion ( t = -2.5; p ≤ 0.01) , receipt of information on SDRN+DT&PL and referral options ( X2 = 4.9; p ≤ 0.05 and X2 = 5.9; p ≤ 0.05 respectively) , discussion of responses ( X2 = 10.2; p ≤ 0.001) , and fuller exposure to SDRN process steps ( X2 = 14.8; p ≤ 0.01). Percentages ( strongly) agreeing were highest on the DT&PL being useful ( 90 %) and suitable ( 88 %) , and lowest on burdensome ( 31 %) and time-consuming ( 28 %). The majority of participating patients encountered the steps of the SDRN process considered essential , with 3/5 having encountered all steps. Referral is largely targeted to patients ' need. Patients ' perceived benefit of SDRN increases with fuller exposure to all process steps. Therefore , improvements , particularly in DT&PL completion and discussion of responses should be made.
