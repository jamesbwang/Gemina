  Over the past decade , the Patient-Centered Medical Home ( PCMH) has become a preeminent model for primary care delivery. Simultaneously , health care disparities have gained increasing attention. There has been limited research on whether and how the PCMH can or should affect health care disparities. The authors conducted qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and experts on the PCMH model and health care disparities , including grant and policy makers , accreditors , researchers , patient advocates , primary care practices , practice transformation organizations , and payers , to assess perspectives on the role of the PCMH in addressing health care disparities. The application of grounded theory and thematic analysis elucidated best practice recommendations for the PCMH model 's role in addressing health care disparities. Although the majority of stakeholders support greater integration of efforts to reduce health care disparities into the PCMH model , most stakeholders view the current PCMH model as having minimal or indirect influence on health care disparities. The majority supported greater integration of efforts to reduce health care disparities into the PCMH model. As the PCMH model continues to be refined , and as the health care system strives toward improving population health , there must be reflection on the policies and delivery systems that impact health care disparities.
