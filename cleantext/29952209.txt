  During 2013-2017 , a total of 1,788 active component service members received incident diagnoses of one of the eating disorders: anorexia<symptom> nervosa ( AN) , bulimia nervosa ( BN) or `` other/unspecified eating disorder '' ( OUED). The crude overall incidence rate of any eating disorder was 2.7 cases per 10,000 person-years. Of the case-defining diagnoses , OUED and BN accounted for 46.4 % and 41.8 % of the total incident cases , respectively. The overall incidence rate of any eating disorder among women was more than 11 times that among men. Overall rates were highest among service members in the youngest age groups ( 29 years or younger). Crude annual incidence rates of total eating disorders increased steadily between 2013 and 2016 , after which rates decreased slightly. Results of the current study suggest that service members likely experience eating disorders at rates that are comparable to rates in the general population , and that rates of these disorders are potentially rising among service members. These findings underscore the need for appropriate prevention and treatment efforts in this population.
