  Have World Trade Center Health Registry ( WTCHR) enrollees experienced increased alcohol and drug-related mortality associated with exposures to the events of 9/11/01? Cases involving death due to alcohol or drugs between 2003 and 2012 in New<pathogen> York City ( NYC) were obtained through a match of the Registry with NYC Vital Records. We compared ICD-10-coded deaths where alcohol and/or drug use was the underlying cause of death to deaths from all other causes. Of 1,193 deaths , 66 ( 5.5 %) were alcohol/drug-related. Adjusted odds ratios for dying from alcohol/drug-related causes were significantly elevated for enrollees who were male , age 18-44 years , smoked at enrollment , had 9/11-related probable PTSD , were rescue/recovery workers , or sustained an injury on 9/11/01. Following a major disaster , alcohol and drug-related mortality may be increased.
