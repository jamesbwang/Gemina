  Uretero-arterial fistula<disease> is a rare condition that can result in life-threatening haematuria , which should be diagnosed and treated immediately. We report a case of uretero-arterial fistula<disease> due to a hypogastric aneurysm<disease>. The patient underwent an endovascular treatment of the hypogastric aneurysm<disease> associated with a percutaneous nephrostomy. Most fistulae<disease> are not identified on computed tomography ( CT) and a high degree of suspicion is needed. Presence of unexplained haematuria with CT diagnosis of hypogastric aneurysm<disease> should raise suspicions of uretero-arterial fistula<disease> as a possible cause.
