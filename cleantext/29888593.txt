  The HIV-1 glycoprotein , gp41 , mediates fusion of the virus lipid envelope with the target cell membrane during virus entry into cells. Despite extensive studies of this protein , inconsistent and contradictory structural information abounds in the literature about the C-terminal membrane-interacting region of gp41. This C-terminal region contains the membrane-proximal external region ( MPER) , which harbors the epitopes for four broadly neutralizing antibodies , and the transmembrane domain ( TMD) , which anchors the protein to the virus lipid envelope. Due to the difficulty of crystallizing and solubilizing the MPER-TMD , most structural studies of this functionally important domain were carried out using truncated peptides either in the absence of membrane-mimetic solvents or bound to detergents and lipid bicelles. To determine the structural architecture of the MPER-TMD in the native environment of lipid membranes<symptom> , we have now carried out a solid-state NMR study of the full MPER-TMD segment bound to cholesterol-containing phospholipid bilayers.
