  In Germany , intoxications cause the bulk of emergencies in children , to be prevented or attenuated by preventive measures. Therefore , knowledge about intoxications is essential for pediatricians. The present work provides general and epidemiologic data about intoxications and most frequent categories and single toxicants. Data of intoxications in children and adolescents from 6 German poison centers ( 2012-2016 and 2002-2016) were retrospectively analyzed. Categorical data are given as mean Â± standard deviation , most frequent toxicants as a score. Calls , especially from non-professionals , increased since 2002. Two third of intoxications occurred in small and pre-school children , more frequently in boys ( 50 %) than girls ( 44 %) , in adolescents girls predominated ( > 60 %). < 14 years intoxications occur mainly at home , day care or school ( > 95 %) , in adolescents suicide attempts and abuse come to the fore ( 13 %). 90 % of the cases are asymptomatic or mild , with increasing symptoms at higher ages ( adolescents 13 % vs. small children 1 %). Intoxications with drugs are predominantly in adolescents , surfactant containing cleaning agents and cosmetics , sanitary cleaner , tobacco , glow lights and solute descaler in children. Increasing incoming calls from professionals and non-professionals point out the importance of the poison centers. Although intoxications in children and adolescents mainly proceed without or mild symptoms , the relevance of preventive measures especially for children < 7 should not be underestimated.
