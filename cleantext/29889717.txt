  Ovarian teratomas potentially demonstrate a wide range of tissue elements including central nervous system differentiation. The latter can include cerebellar tissue , which in our experience remains an under-recognized phenomenon. In the current study we present a review of 6 ovarian teratomas including 4 mature cystic teratomas and 2 immature teratomas showing cerebellar differentiation. Two cases were seen in consultation because the cerebellar elements were initially misinterpreted as immature teratomas. Two mature cystic teratomas focally demonstrated a distinct cerebellar architecture including folial type structures , but in all cases the cerebellar elements usually showed a less organized anatomic appearance , and sometimes these were concerning for immature teratomas upon initial examination. This concern was exacerbated in 5 cases by the presence of a cytologically immature and mitotically active neuronal component corresponding to the external granular layer of normal fetal and neonatal cerebellum. However , careful examination demonstrated the characteristic molecular , Purkinje and ( internal) granular layers of cerebellum. Furthermore , while the external granular layer in teratomas strongly expressed Ki67 , corresponding to the proliferative activity of this cellular compartment physiologically , immunostaining was often helpful in highlighting the preserved zonal pattern of cellular proliferation. The absence or minimal expression of SALL4 , OCT3/4 , and SOX2 was also helpful in this regard. Cytoplasmic OCT3/4 expression in osteoblasts was noted incidentally in 2 tumors , but further studies are required to determine whether this is a consistent and diagnostically useful finding.
