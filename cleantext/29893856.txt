  Exploring genes and pathways underlying Intellectual Disability ( ID) provides insight into brain development and function , clarifying the complex puzzle of how cognition develops. As part of ongoing systematic studies to identify candidate ID genes , linkage analysis and next generation sequencing revealed ZBTB11 , as a novel candidate ID gene. ZBTB11 encodes a less-studied transcription regulator and the two identified missense variants in this study may disrupt canonical Zn2 +- binding residues of its C2H2 zinc finger domain , leading to possible altered DNA binding. Using HEK293T cells transfected with wild type and mutant GFP-ZBTB11 constructs , we found the ZBTB11 mutants being excluded from the nucleolus , where the wild-type recombinant protein is predominantly localized. Pathway analysis applied to ChIP-seq data deposited in the ENCODE database supports the localization of ZBTB11 in nucleoli , highlighting associated pathways such as rRNA synthesis , ribosomal assembly , RNA modification , stress sensing and provides a direct link between subcellular ZBTB11 location and its function. Furthermore , considering the report of prominent brain and spinal cord degeneration in a zebrafish Zbtb11 mutant , we investigated ZBTB11-ortholog knockdown in Drosophila melanogaster brain by targeting RNAi using the UAS/Gal4 system. The observed approximate reduction to a third of the mushroom body size- possibly through neuronal reduction or degeneration- may affect neuronal circuits in the brain that are required for adaptive behavior , specifying the role of this gene in nervous system. In conclusion , we report two ID families segregating ZBTB11 biallelic mutations disrupting Zn2 +- binding motifs , and provide functional evidence linking ZBTB11 dysfunction to this phenotype.
