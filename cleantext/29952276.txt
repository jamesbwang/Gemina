  CLINICIAN 'S CAPSULE What is known about the topic? The steps for performing a bougie-assisted cricothyroidotomy ( BAC) have not been systematically developed , leading to instructional and performance variability. What did this study ask? Can the modified Delphi process be used to establish the essential steps required for BAC instruction? What did this study find? Using a modified Delphi methodology , we developed a 17-item BAC checklist to guide instruction for novice learners. Why does this study matter to clinicians? This checklist , developed by expert consensus , can be used to improve consistency in training for this life-saving procedure.
