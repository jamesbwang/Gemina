  Measures of the adipokine chemerin are elevated in multiple cardiovascular diseases , including hypertension , but little mechanistic work has been done to implicate chemerin as being causative in such diseases. The chemerin knockout ( KO) rat was created to test the hypothesis that removal of chemerin would reduce pressure in the normal and hypertensive state. Western analyses confirmed loss of chemerin in the plasma and tissues of the KO vs. wild-type ( WT) rats. Chemerin concentration in plasma and tissues was lower in WT females than in WT males , as determined by Western analysis. Conscious male and female KO rats had modest differences in baseline measures vs. the WT that included systolic , diastolic , mean arterial and pulse pressures , and heart rate , all measured telemetrically. The mineralocorticoid deoxycorticosterone acetate ( DOCA) and salt water , combined with uninephrectomy as a hypertensive stimulus , elevated mean and systolic blood<symptom> pressures<symptom> of the male KO higher than the male WT. By contrast , all pressures in the female KO were lower than their WT throughout DOCA-salt treatment. These results revealed an unexpected sex difference in chemerin expression and the ability of chemerin to modify blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in response to a hypertensive challenge.-Watts , S.
