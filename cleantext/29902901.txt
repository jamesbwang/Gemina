  This paper was aimed to investigate the effects of emodin on oxidative stress and inflammatory response in rats with acute spinal cord injury （ SCI ） , and to explore the protective mechanism of emodin on neurons after SCI. Rat SCI models were established using a modified Allen 's method. One hundred and ninety five Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divded into sham ( group A) , model ( group B) , emodin group of 20 mg · kg ⁻¹ ( group C) , emodin group of 40 mg · kg ⁻¹ ( group D) , emodin group of 80 mg · kg ⁻¹ ( group E). Functional recovery was evaluated using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan ( BBB) scale and inclined plate test on the 3rd , 7th , 14th and 28th day. On the 7th day after SCI , neuron nylon body was observed with toluidine blue staining. The changes of myelinated nerve fibers were observed by transmission electron microscope. Nrf2 , HO-1 , NQO1 , GFAP , NF-κB protein were detected by Western blot. The content of TNF-α , IL-1β , IL-6 were detected by ELISA. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to observe the expression of the GFAP , NG2 and ED-1. The BBB and inclined plate scores of group C , D and E were higher than group B on the 7th , 14th , 28th day , the difference was statistically significant (
