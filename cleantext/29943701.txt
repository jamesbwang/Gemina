  In the present short communication , a brief historical survey of the mean-field theoretical description of electric double layer ( EDL) is presented. A special attention is devoted to asymmetric finite size of ions and orientational ordering of water dipoles. A model of Wicke and Eigen , who were first to explicitly derive the ion distribution functions for finite size of ions , is discussed. Arguments are given in favour of changing the recently adopted name of the mean-field EDL model for finite size of ions from Bikerman model to Bikerman-Wicke-Eigen model. Theoretically predicted asymmetric and symmetric camel-like shape of the voltage dependence of the differential capacitance is also discussed.
