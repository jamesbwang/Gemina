  Rising urine NGAL and serum creatinine after 48 hr are potentially useful in predicting persistent creatinine increase in patients with contrast-induced AKI. Urinary NGAL may allow for early identification of a high-risk cohort following PCI. Future studies are needed to determine whether renal biomarkers are affected by clinical variables , such as heart<symptom> failure<symptom> acute mechanical circulatory support ( AMCS) and whether they can be used to identify patients who would benefit from either AMCS reno-protection during PCI remains unknown.
