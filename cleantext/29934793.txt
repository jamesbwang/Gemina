  Internalized HIV<pathogen> stigma can affect health outcomes , but the mechanism underlying this relationship is poorly understood. We investigated the potential pathways for the association between internalized stigma and opportunistic infections ( OIs) among women living with HIV<pathogen> in rural India. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving in-person interviews with 600 participants. We modeled two outcome variables , total number of OIs and fungal dermatoses , which was the most frequently reported OI. Causal mediation analysis was performed to estimate the total effect , direct effect , and indirect effect through mediators while controlling for confounders. Food insecurity was a strong mediator of the association between internalized stigma and the number of OIs ( 70 % of the total effect) and fungal dermatoses ( 83 % of the total effect) , while the indirect effect of stigma through adherence was minimal for both outcomes. Household food insecurity may be an important mediator of the impact of HIV-related stigma on opportunistic infections.
