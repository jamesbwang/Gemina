  The aim of present study was to develop an oxybutynin ( OXY) transdermal patch with good permeation behavior and mechanical property. Special attention was paid to the effect of chemical enhancer on the molecular mobility of pressure sensitive adhesive ( PSA) at molecular level. PSAs and permeation enhancers were investigated through in vitro experiment using rat skin. The optimized formulation was evaluated through pharmacokinetic study using rat. In addition , the molecular mechanism of sorbitan monooleate ( Span Â® 80) in the improvement of PSA molecular mobility was investigated using FT-IR , molecular dynamics simulation , DSC and rheological study. As a result , the optimized formulation using amide PSA demonstrated good adhesion property. And the AUC
