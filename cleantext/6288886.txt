  Sensory information travels along feedforward connections through a hierarchy of cortical areas , which , in turn , send feedback connections to lower-order areas. Feedback has been implicated in attention , expectation , and sensory context , but the mechanisms underlying these diverse feedback functions are unknown. Using specific optogenetic inactivation of feedback connections from the secondary visual area ( V2) , we show how feedback affects neural responses in the primate primary visual cortex ( V1). Reducing feedback activity increases V1 cells ' receptive field ( RF) size , decreases their responses to stimuli confined to the RF , and increases their responses to stimuli extending into the proximal surround , therefore reducing surround suppression. Moreover , stronger reduction of V2 feedback activity leads to progressive increase in RF size and decrease in response amplitude , an effect predicted by a recurrent network model. Our results indicate that feedback modulates RF size , surround suppression and response amplitude , similar to the modulatory effects of visual spatial attention.
