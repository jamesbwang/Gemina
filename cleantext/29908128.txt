  to explore potential users ' opinions of a translated and culturally adapted Swedish version of the General Medical Council 's MultiSource Feedback Questionnaires. In this qualitative study , we used content analysis on semi-structured interviews from 44 resident doctors , 29 medical colleagues and 28 patients to analyse their opinions of the Swedish adapted version , created through translation and expert review. Transcribed interview data concerning the informants ' general thoughts about the tool were coded manually by three independent coders into categories , compiled as themes , and exemplified by citations. Data regarding specific question wording and relevance were used as a basis for final questionnaire revision. The informants valued the tool 's potential to provide essential feedback to support the development of residents ' medical competences and communication skills. Resident doctors welcomed support in their self-reflection. Colleagues saw it as a valuable tool for assessment that needs to be used sensitively. Patients appreciated opportunities to communicate feedback. Ambiguous or irrelevant questions and response options were identified. Some colleague-related questions about specific skills and knowledge appeared ambiguous to residents. The final questionnaire revision- based on the expert review and the interview analysis- resulted in a number of changes: four questions were deleted , twelve were reformulated , and six were added. Potential users perceived the Swedish adapted version as a beneficial tool for residents in their professional development. Further research is needed to explore how this tool can influence doctors ' development when used in real-life settings.
