  The incidence of traumatic brain injury ( TBI) has been increasing annually. Annexin A7 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein. It can promote melting of the cell membrane. Recent studies have shown that it plays an important role in atherosclerosis , other cardiovascular diseases , and a variety of tumors. However , few studies of ANXA7 in TBI have been performed. We here observed how ANXA7 changes after TBI and discuss whether brain injury is associated with the use of ANXA7 antagonist intervention.
