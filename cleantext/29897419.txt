  The increase of antifungal drug resistance is a major global human health concern and threatens agriculture and food security; in order to tackle these concerns , it is important to understand the mechanisms that cause antifungal resistance. The curated Mycology Antifungal Resistance Database ( MARDy) is a web-service of antifungal drug resistance mechanisms , including amino acid substitutions , tandem repeat sequences and genome ploidy. MARDy is implemented on a Linux , Apache , MySQL and PHP web development platform and includes a local installation of BLASTn of the database of curated genes. MARDy can be accessed at http://www.mardy.net and is free to use. The complete database can be retrieved , ordered by organism , gene and drug. Missing or new mycological antifungal resistance data can be relayed to the development team through a contribute entry form. Updates and news will be publicised via a dedicated Twitter feed: @MARDYfungi. mardy@imperial.ac.uk.
