  Extreme environments such as the Antarctic can lead to the discovery of new microbial taxa , as well as to new microbial-derived natural products. Considering that little is known yet about the diversity and the genetic resources present in these habitats , the main objective of this study was to evaluate the fungal communities from extreme environments collected at Aldmiralty Bay ( Antarctica). A total of 891 and 226 isolates was obtained from soil and marine sediment samples , respectively. The most abundant isolates from soil samples were representatives of the genera Leucosporidium , Pseudogymnoascus<pathogen> , and a non-identified Ascomycota<pathogen> NIA6. Metschnikowia<pathogen> sp. was the most abundant taxon from marine samples , followed by isolates from the genera Penicillium and Pseudogymnoascus<pathogen>. Many of the genera were exclusive in marine sediment or terrestrial samples. However , representatives of eight genera were found in both types of samples. Data from non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that each sampling site is unique in their physical-chemical composition and fungal community. Biotechnological potential in relation to enzymatic production at low/moderate temperatures was also investigated. Ligninolytic enzymes were produced by few isolates from root-associated soil. Among the fungi<pathogen> isolated from marine sediments , 16 yeasts and nine fungi<pathogen> showed lipase activity and three yeasts and six filamentous fungi<pathogen> protease activity. The present study permitted increasing our knowledge on the diversity of fungi<pathogen> that inhabit the Antarctic , finding genera that have never been reported in this environment before and discovering putative new species of
