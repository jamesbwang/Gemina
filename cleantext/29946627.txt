  Three new mononuclear Fe ( ii) complexes have been prepared and characterized by the combination of tetradentate tris ( 2-pyridylmethyl) amine ( TPMA) with three neutral bidentate ligands , such as ethylenediamine ( en) , 1,2-diaminopropane ( pn) and 2-picolylamine ( 2-pic) , in compounds ( FeII ( TPMA) ( en)) ( ClO4) 2 ( 1) , ( FeII ( TPMA) ( 2-pic)) ( ClO4) 2 ( 2) and ( FeII ( TPMA) ( pn)) ( ClO4) 2 ( 3). Structural and magnetic characterization demonstrates that the three compounds present a complete SCO behavior. The absence of strong intermolecular interactions and solvent molecules leads to reversible and gradual spin transitions. The different ligands allow tuning T1/2 from 130 K ( 2) to 325 K ( 3). The compound with the lowest T1/2 ( 2) shows the LIESST effect with a TLIESST of 43 K. Interestingly , the use of these relatively small bidentate ligands leads to the crystallization in non-centrosymmetric space groups in contrast with previous studies using other bidentate ligands.
