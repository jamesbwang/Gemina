  The folding and acquisition of proteins native structure is central to all biological processes of life. By contrast , protein misfolding can lead to toxic amyloid aggregates formation , linked to the onset of neurodegenerative disorders. To shed light on the molecular basis of protein function and malfunction , it is crucial to access structural information on single protein assemblies and aggregates under native conditions. Yet , current conformation-sensitive spectroscopic methods lack the spatial resolution and sensitivity necessary for characterizing heterogeneous protein aggregates in solution. To overcome this limitation , here we use photothermal-induced resonance to demonstrate that it is possible to acquire nanoscale infrared spectra in water with high signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR). Using this approach , we probe supramolecular aggregates of diphenylalanine , the core recognition module of the Alzheimer 's Î²-amyloid peptide , and its derivative Boc-diphenylalanine. We achieve nanoscale resolved IR spectra and maps in air and water with comparable SNR and lateral resolution , thus enabling accurate identification of the chemical and structural state of morphologically similar networks at the single aggregate ( i. e. , fibril) level.
