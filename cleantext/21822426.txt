  We present a significant extension of the Brain Imaging Data Structure ( BIDS) to support the specific aspects of magnetoencephalography ( MEG) data. MEG measures brain activity with millisecond temporal resolution and unique source imaging capabilities. So far , BIDS was a solution to organise magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) data. The nature and acquisition parameters of MRI and MEG data are strongly dissimilar. Although there is no standard data format for MEG , we propose MEG-BIDS as a principled solution to store , organise , process and share the multidimensional data volumes produced by the modality. The standard also includes well-defined metadata , to facilitate future data harmonisation and sharing efforts. This responds to unmet needs from the multimodal neuroimaging community and paves the way to further integration of other techniques in electrophysiology. MEG-BIDS builds on MRI-BIDS , extending BIDS to a multimodal data structure. We feature several data-analytics software that have adopted MEG-BIDS , and a diverse sample of open MEG-BIDS data resources available to everyone.
