  A wire-free device is available for REBOA providing aortic occlusion ( AO) without lengthy platform guide-wires and large sheaths. This was a retrospective , single-institution review of patients who received REBOA from May 2014-September 2017. Timing of procedural steps was measured in seconds ( s) using time-stamped videography. 74 patients received REBOA; 29 with a platform guidewire , 12F sheath , and balloon catheter ( W group) , and 45 with a 7F sheath and wire-free device ( WF group). Mean age ( p = 0.22) and ISS ( p = 0.80) were similar between groups. 59 patients received REBOA at Zone 1; 15 patients at Zone 3. There was no difference in median ( IQR) time to common femoral artery ( CFA) access between the WF ( 194 ( 98,313) s) and W ( 193 ( 126,280) s) groups ( p = 0.96). Both median time to AO after CFA access ( WF: 158 ( 109,264) s vs. W: 307 ( 222,390) s , p < 0.001) and median total procedural time ( WF: 366 ( 263,596) s vs. W: 511 ( 441,597) s; p = 0.012) were significantly shorter with the wire-free system. The rates of percutaneous versus open CFA access was not different between groups ( p = 0.48). Both groups had a similar physiologic response to AO as measured by pre- and post-AO SBP ( p = 0.86). Overall mortality rate was 74 %; 90 % in the W group , and 64 % in the WF group ( p = 0.027). The procedure-related complication rate was not significantly different between groups with regard to compartment syndrome<disease> ( W: 3 % vs WF: 4 % , p = 1.0) , access-related complications ( W: 0 vs WF: 6 % , p = 0.28) or systemic complication ( W: 0 vs WF: 9 % , p = 0.15). Once CFA access is obtained , AO with a smaller wire-free device reduces procedural time by approximately 50 %. When perfusion to proximal organs is essential , the seconds saved to achieve AO may contribute to improved mortality. Time to obtain CFA access is not dependent on introducer sheath size.
