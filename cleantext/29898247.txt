  BATF functions in T cells and B cells to control the host response to antigen and promote the production of class switched immunoglobulins. In this study , we demonstrate that BATF expression increases rapidly , and transiently , following B cell stimulation and use an inducible murine model of BATF deletion to show that this induction is necessary , and sufficient , for immunoglobulin ( Ig) class switch recombination ( CSR). We examine two genes ( Nfil3 and miR155gh) that are positively regulated , and one gene ( Wnt10a) that is negatively regulated by BATF during CSR. These genes play essential roles in CSR and each impacts the expression and/or function of the others. Our observations allow these targets of BATF regulation to be positioned in a network upstream of the activation of germline transcripts ( GLT) from the IgH locus and of transcriptional activation of Aicda- the gene encoding the enzyme directing Ig gene rearrangements. This work extends the knowledge of the molecular control of CSR and , importantly , positions the induction and function of BATF as an early event in this process.
