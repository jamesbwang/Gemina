  This paper presents an approach to solving the phase problem in nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) diffusion pore imaging , a method that allows imaging the shape of arbitrary closed pores filled with an NMR-detectable medium for investigation of the microstructure of biological tissue and porous materials. Classical q-space imaging composed of two short diffusion-encoding gradient pulses yields , analogously to diffraction experiments , the modulus squared of the Fourier transform of the pore image which entails an inversion problem: An unambiguous reconstruction of the pore image requires both magnitude and phase. Here the phase information is recovered from the Fourier modulus by applying a phase retrieval algorithm. This allows omitting experimentally challenging phase measurements using specialized temporal gradient profiles. A combination of the hybrid input-output algorithm and the error reduction algorithm was used with dynamically adapting support ( shrinkwrap extension). No a priori knowledge on the pore shape was fed to the algorithm except for a finite pore extent. The phase retrieval approach proved successful for simulated data with and without noise and was validated in phantom experiments with well-defined pores using hyperpolarized xenon gas.
