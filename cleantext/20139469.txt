  Recent work has shown that HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells rely on a unique Warburg-like metabolism for survival and aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom>. These cells are dependent on fatty acid ( FA) synthesis , show markedly increased levels of stored fats and disruption of the synthetic process results in apoptosis. In this study , we used global metabolite profiling and a multi-omics network analysis approach to model the metabolic changes in this physiology under palmitate-supplemented growth conditions to gain insights into the molecular mechanism and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment. Computational analyses were used to define pathway enrichment based on the dataset of significantly altered metabolites and to integrate metabolomics and transcriptomics data in a multi-omics network analysis. Network-predicted changes and functional relationships were tested with cell assays
