  Leptin expression decreases after fat loss and is increased when obesity develops , and its proper quantitative regulation is essential for the homeostatic control of fat mass. We previously reported that a distant leptin enhancer 1 ( LE1) , 16 kb upstream from the transcription start site ( TSS) , confers fat-specific expression in a bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic ( BACTG) reporter mouse. However , this and the other elements that we identified do not account for the quantitative changes in leptin expression that accompany alterations of adipose mass. In this report , we used an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing ( ATAC-seq) to identify a 17-bp noncanonical peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ)/ retinoid X receptor alpha ( RXRα)- binding site , leptin regulatory element 1 ( LepRE1) , within LE1 , and show that it is necessary for the fat-regulated quantitative control of reporter ( luciferase) expression. While BACTG reporter mice with mutations in this sequence still show fat-specific expression , luciferase is no longer decreased after food restriction and weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. Similarly , the increased expression of leptin reporter associated with obesity in
