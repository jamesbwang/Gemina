  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder , characterized by age inappropriate and impairing levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Pharmacotherapy is an important part of the ADHD multimodal treatment. The extent to which ADHD is pharmacologically over or under treated worldwide is controversial. We aimed to estimate the pooled worldwide rate of ADHD pharmacological treatment in individuals with and without the disorder. We will include published or unpublished studies reporting the rates of ADHD pharmacological treatment in participants with and without ADHD of any age group. Population-based , cohort , or follow-up studies , as well as data from insurance health system and third-party reimbursements will be eligible. Searches will be performed in a large number of electronic databases , including Medline , Embase , CINAHL , Cochrane , PsycINFO , Web of Science , and Scopus. The primary outcome will be the prevalence of ADHD pharmacological treatment in individuals with ADHD and without ADHD. Two independent reviewers will perform the screening , and data extraction process. Study quality/bias will be assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale by 2 independent reviewers. To test the robustness of the findings , we will perform a series of sensitivity and meta-regression analysis. Analyses will be performed with R and STATA software. No IRB approval will be necessary. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be presented at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018085233.
