  Sanitary landfill remains the most common methodology for final treatment and disposal of municipal solid waste worldwide , the cost per tonne depends on its scale. The bigger the landfill , the cheaper the cost of treatment , so the consortium of municipalities is the solution to achieve an economic scale. However , the growth of waste production introduces pressure for adequate solutions and therefore has been increasing sanitary landfill site selection studies. This study proposes a methodology for siting sanitary landfills and optimising the transport of municipal solid waste for a locality in the state of SÃ£o Paulo , Brazil. Environmental , social , and economic criteria were established. Their correlated attributes were categorised into suitability levels and weighted according to multiple decision analysis. The data were organised and mapped within a geographic information system. Considering sites where landfills are prohibited , two scenarios were generated. The Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming mathematical model is used to minimise the costs of transporting municipal solid waste and operating sanitary landfills. In Scenario 1 , the results indicated that 64 % of the area was suitable as a potential sanitary landfill site , 9 % of the area exhibited medium suitability , and 27 % of the area was classified as restricted. In Scenario 2 , the results indicated that 25 % of the area was suitable as a potential sanitary landfill site , 4 % of the area had medium suitability , and 71 % of the area was classified as restricted. The optimal solutions for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 enabled sites to be determined for five landfills and four landfills , respectively.
