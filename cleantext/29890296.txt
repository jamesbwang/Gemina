  Ginseng ( Panax ginseng C.A. Mayer) contains saponin fractions called ginsenosides , which are thought to be the main components responsible for its various pharmacological activities. Ginsenosides have cardioprotective and antiplatelet effects. In the present study , we evaluated the effects of ginsenoside Rp3 ( G-Rp3) on platelet function. The in vitro effects of G-Rp3 were evaluated on agonist-induced human and rat platelet aggregation , while ( Ca G-Rp3 significantly inhibited collagen , ADP , and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. G-Rp3 elevated cAMP levels and VASP phosphorylation and suppressed agonist-induced ( Ca G-Rp3 modulates agonist-induced platelet activation and thrombus formation by inhibiting granule secretion , integrin Î±
