  Mutations in SLC34A1 , encoding the proximal tubular sodium-phosphate transporter NaPi-IIa , may cause a range of clinical phenotypes including infantile hypercalcemia , a proximal renal Fanconi syndrome<disease> , which are typically autosomal recessive , and hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis , which may be an autosomal dominant trait. Here , we report two patients with mixed clinical phenotypes , both with metabolic acidosis , hyperphosphaturia , and renal stones. Patient A had a single heterozygous pathogenic missense mutation ( p.I456N) in SLC34A1 , consistent with the autosomal dominant pattern of renal stone disease in this family. Patient B , with an autosomal recessive pattern of disease , was compound heterozygous for SLC34A1 variants; a missense variant ( p.R512C) together with a relatively common in-frame deletion p.V91A97del7 ( 91del7). Xenopus oocyte and renal ( HKC-8) cell line transfection studies of the variants revealed limited cell surface localization , consistent with trafficking defects. Co-expression of wild-type and I456N and 91del7 appeared to cause intracellular retention in HKC-8 , whereas the R512C mutant had a less dominant effect. Expression in Xenopus oocytes failed to demonstrate a significant dominant negative effect for I456N and R512C; however , a negative impact of 91del7 on (
