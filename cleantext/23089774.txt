  A custom near infrared VCSEL source has been implemented in a confocal non-mydriatic retinal camera , the Digital Light Ophthalmoscope ( DLO). The use of near infrared light improves patient comfort , avoids pupil constriction , penetrates the deeper retina , and does not mask visual stimuli. The DLO performs confocal imaging by synchronizing a sequence of lines displayed with a digital micromirror device to the rolling shutter exposure of a 2D CMOS camera. Real-time software adjustments enable multiply scattered light imaging , which rapidly and cost-effectively emphasizes drusen and other scattering disruptions in the deeper retina. A separate 5.1 â€³ LCD display provides customizable visible stimuli for vision experiments with simultaneous near infrared imaging.
