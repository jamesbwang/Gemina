  Acoustophoresis is a form of contact-free particle manipulation in microfluidic devices. The precision of manipulation can be enhanced with better understanding of the acoustic radiation force. In this paper we present the measurements of interparticle radiation force between a pair of polystyrene beads in the Rayleigh limit. The study is conducted for three different sizes of beads and the experimental results are of the same order of magnitude when compared with theoretical predictions. However , the experimental values are larger than the theoretical values. The trend of a decrease in the magnitude of the interparticle radiation force with decreasing particle size and increasing center-to-center distance between the particles is also observed experimentally. The experiments are conducted in the specific scenario where the pair of beads are in close proximity , but not in contact with each other , and the beads are approaching the pressure nodal plane with the center-to-center line aligned perpendicular to the incident wave. This scenario minimizes the presence of the primary radiation force , allowing accurate measurement of the interparticle force. The attractive nature of the interparticle force is observed , consistent with theoretical predictions.
