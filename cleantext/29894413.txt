  Treatment of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ( FSGS) after kidney transplantation is challenging with unpredictable outcomes. The objective was to investigate the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH) analogue gel in kidney transplant recipients with de novo or recurrent FSGS resistant to therapeutic plasma exchange and/or rituximab. We performed a retrospective review of cases of de novo or recurrent resistant FSGS at 2 large U.S. transplant centers between April 2012 and December 2016. Proteinuria<symptom> was measured by urine protein to creatinine ratio ( UPCR). We identified 20 cases of posttransplant recurrent and de novo FSGS resistant to conventional therapy with therapeutic plasma exchange ( TPE) and rituximab. Mean ± SD age was 49 ± 15.5 years , 14 ( 70 %) were male , 13 ( 65 %) were Caucasians , and 8 ( 38 %) had previous kidney transplants. Median ( IQR) of recurrent and de novo FSGS was 3 ( 0.75- 7.5) months posttransplant. The majority of patients , 15 ( 75 %) , received TPE as a treatment at the time of diagnosis; and 10 ( 50 %) received rituximab as well; which was started before the use of ACTH gel. There was a significant improvement of UPCR from a mean ± SD of 8.6 ± 7.6 g/g before ACTH gel to 3.3 ± 2.3 g/g after the use of ACTH gel ( P = 0.004). Ten patients ( 50 %) achieved complete or partial remission. Although , the response varied among the recipients , ACTH gel might be an effective therapy for posttransplant resistant FSGS cases that fail to respond to therapeutic plasma exchange and rituximab.
