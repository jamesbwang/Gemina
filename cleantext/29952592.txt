  Reappraisal is a multifaceted construct associated with a wide range of proximal ( e.g. , affective responses) and distal ( e.g. , psychopathology) consequences. To date , our understanding of use of reappraisal is based either on self-reports of tendencies to use a specific strategy in general or in the last week or on performance on lab-based tasks. There has been little effort to measure use of reappraisal immediately following an emotionally evocative situation ( i.e. , state-reappraisal). To close this gap , we developed the State-Reappraisal Inventory ( SRI) that ascertains use of reappraisal immediately after an emotional event. In Study 1 , exploratory factor analyses yielded two reliable subscales measuring state levels of construal of an emotion-eliciting situating as more positive ( Increase Positive) and less negative ( Decrease Negative). In two further studies , confirmatory factor analyses using a bifactor model provided a good fit for the data and surpassed three competing models. In a fourth study , the SRI showed sensitivity to experimentally induced state changes in reappraisal. Across studies , the questionnaire demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity. Thus , the SRI is a new measure of state-reappraisal that can allow researchers and clinicians to examine the extent to which individuals use reappraisal in emotional situations.
