  Total dissolved solids ( TDS) concentrations in groundwater tapped for beneficial uses ( drinking water , irrigation , freshwater industrial) have increased on average by about 100 mg/L over the last 100 years in the San Joaquin Valley , California ( SJV). During this period land use in the SJV changed from natural vegetation and dryland agriculture to dominantly irrigated agriculture with growing urban areas. Century-scale salinity trends were evaluated by comparing TDS concentrations and major ion compositions of groundwater from wells sampled in 1910 ( Historic) to data from wells sampled in 1993-2015 ( Modern). TDS concentrations in subregions of the SJV , the southern ( SSJV) , western ( WSJV) , northeastern ( NESJV) , and southeastern ( SESJV) were calculated using a cell-declustering method. TDS concentrations increased in all regions , with the greatest increases found in the SSJV and SESJV. Evaluation of the Modern data from the NESJV and SESJV found higher TDS concentrations in recently recharged ( post-1950) groundwater from shallow ( < 50 m) wells surrounded predominantly by agricultural land uses , while premodern ( pre-1950) groundwater from deeper wells , and recently recharged groundwater from wells surrounded by mainly urban , natural , and mixed land uses had lower TDS concentrations , approaching the TDS concentrations in the Historic groundwater. For the NESJV and SESJV , inverse geochemical modeling with PHREEQC indicated that weathering of primary silicate minerals accounted for the majority of the increase in TDS concentrations , contributing more than nitrate from fertilizers and sulfate from soil amendments combined. Bicarbonate showed the greatest increase among major ions , resulting from enhanced silicate weathering due to recharge of irrigation water enriched in CO
