  The magnetic behavior of the polyanion ( Fe3 ( μ-L) 6 ( H2O) 6) 6- ( L2- = ( 1,2,4-triazol-4-yl) ethanedisulfonate) as the corresponding dimethylammonium salt shows memory effect above room temperature , with a dynamic thermal hysteresis cycle over 90 K and temperature-induced excited spin state trapping ( TIESST) phenomena at the highest temperatures reported. Taking advantage of the polyanionic nature of this trimetallic complex , we were able to substitute the dimethylammonium cations by the monovalent heavy alkali metal cesium. This methathesis yielded the salt Cs6 ( Fe3 ( μ-L) 6 ( H2O) 6) , with different molecular packing that increases the number and strength of cation-anion interactions , including a more robust H-bonded network. In this phase , the spin transition still occurs above room temperature , but it is more abrupt and narrow ( ≈ 50 K wide hysteresis). Despite these differences , TIESST is observed with almost identical characteristic temperature ( TTIESST = 240 K) than in the parent compound , which is an additional experimental evidence supporting the molecular origin of the TIESST behavior in these materials.
