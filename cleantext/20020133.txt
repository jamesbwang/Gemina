  The aim of the present study was to compare 2 clinical assessment tools , the Modified Barthel Index ( currently administered to patients admitted into inpatient rehabilitation units after elective hip or knee arthroplasty) with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule ( WHODAS) 2.0 scale , in order to identify which tool is more suitable for assessing the disability and the `` recovery rate ''. A perspective multicenter observational study was developed , involving 2 hospital authorities in Italy. Eighty consecutive cases of inpatients were enrolled. Patient 's disability was evaluated using both of the aforementioned tools , before and after the rehabilitation program. The WHODAS 2.0 score was , on average , 12.21 % higher than the Modified Barthel Index , before the surgical intervention. Modified Barthel Index measures could be considered as a determinant and a predictor of length of stay. The Modified Barthel Index is limited , since it does not consider a patient 's perspective. The WHODAS 2.0 scale fully considers a patient 's perception of disability. Therefore , both assessment scales should be administered in clinical practice , in order to provide integration of clinical information with a patient 's reported outcome measures.
