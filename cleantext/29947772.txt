  Prox1 is a transcription factor necessary for lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic function. The aim of the study was to assess the correlation between the expression of Prox1 and postoperative recurrence in Crohn 's Disease ( CD). Forty CD patients who underwent ileocolonic resection were included. Expression levels of Prox1 and D2-40 were detected using immunohistochemistry. Expression levels of Prox1 , VEGFR3 , and VEGFC protein were also detected in fresh CD specimens using western blotting and Q-PCR. Endoscopic recurrence was used as the endpoint. Patients comprised two groups: endoscopic recurrence ( Group R +) and no endoscopic recurrence ( Group R-). Prox1 protein expression was significantly higher in CD than in normal tissues ( P < 0.05) , as detected using both immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Analysis of interrelationships revealed significant correlation between Prox1 expression and lymphatic vessel density ( P < 0.001 , r = 0.823). There was also significant correlation between Prox1 expression and the visceral fat area ( VFA) ( P = 0.002 , r = -0.469). The Group R- patients had significantly higher Prox1 expression than the Group R + patients ( 21.08 ± 1.61 vs. 15.64 ± 1.17 , P = 0.011). Also , the lymphatic vessel density value was lower in Group R + than in Group R- patients ( 6.02 ± 0.39 vs. 8.13 ± 0.59 , P = 0.004). Moreover , there was a significant difference in the VFA between Group R - and Group R + patients ( 64.43 ± 7.76 vs. 90.44 ± 6.11 , P = 0.016). In addition to Prox1 , VEGFC/VEGFR3 was found to increase , which was further confirmed using Q-PCR. Prox1 expression could be useful as a protective factor against recurrence in CD patients. The therapeutic role of Prox1 may lead to improved treatments.
