  Small-cell carcinoma of the ovary , hypercalcemic type ( SCCOHT) is a rare but highly undifferentiated , aggressive malignancy that primarily affects young women. Due to its early onset , unclear familial history and vague presenting symptoms , most SCCOHT patients present late with advanced disease. The prognosis is extremely poor , with < 10 % disease-free survival for advanced stages. Although several therapeutic regimens have been proposed , to date there is no consensus on the optimal strategy. Here , we describe a successful case of advanced-stage SCCOHT of the left ovary treated with cytoreductive surgery , semi-intense chemotherapy , high-dose consolidative chemotherapy , autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and pelvic radiation with long-term survival. Given the almost universal mortality of advanced SCCOHT in long-term follow-up , we believe this case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis when a young patient presents with abdominal swelling and hypercalcemia as well as early , aggressive , combined modality treatment. This case is also especially remarkable given the patient underwent fertility preservation surgery , which is not recommended by most of the current literature. However , as therapies improve and more young patients may survive SCCOHT , the question of fertility will increase in relevance. We believe the pros and cons of conservation should be discussed in detail with the patient.
