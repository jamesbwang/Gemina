  The aim of this study is to explore the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of aqueous extract from aerial parts of Inula helenium ( L.) against human U-87 MG glioma cell line. The 3 '- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase assays were used to study antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities against U-87 MG cell after 48 h exposure. In addition , to assess the oxidative effects , total antioxidant capacity and total oxidant status levels were also measured. Finally , the aqueous extracts displayed antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities at high concentrations tested , particularly at 200 Î¼g/ml , without causing to oxidative stress. The results strengthen the evidence that I. helenium could be considered a natural resource of potential antitumor agents for brain cancer. In addition , this study is expected to expand the existing information on the anticancer activity of I. helenium and to assist in a more focused design of further research as chemotherapeutic agents.
