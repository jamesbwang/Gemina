  The ideal absorbable plating system should provide sufficient rigidity and then be absorbed within a timely manner. The Resorb-X has been recently developed as a plating system with a mixture ratio of 50:50 poly ( D , L-lactide). We present seven of 121 patients who experienced delayed degradation with this absorbable plate. One hundred twenty-one patients with facial bone fracture underwent surgical treatment from March 2011 to March 2015 , and rigid fixation was achieved with the Resorb-X. Of 121 patients , seven ( 5.8 %) developed complications at the surgical sites. Six of 102 cases underwent fixation of the infraorbital rim and one of 73 underwent fixation of the frontozygomatic buttress; the other sites of fixation did not develop delayed degradation. Foreign body granuloma<disease> developed at the earliest by postoperative 20 months and at the latest by postoperative 28 months ( average , 23.5 months). We observed that the use of absorbable plates in incision sites or areas with thin skin can increase the possibility of delayed degradation. When performing surgery in these areas , the normal skin above the fixed location should be covered sufficiently.
