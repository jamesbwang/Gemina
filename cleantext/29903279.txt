  To investigate the content of fatty acids in five different animal products and evaluate the difference. Different parts of animal products were collected from pork , cattle , lamb , chicken and duck. The contents of fatty acids were measured by using gas chromatography. The compositions of fatty acids in pork , ruminant and poultry were similar. However , there were significant differences among the contents for certain fatty acids ( P < 0. 05). Pork and ruminant had higher levels of saturated fatty acids , and lower polyunsaturated fatty acids contents. The proportion of saturated fatty acids in pork was lower than that in ruminant , while the polyunsaturated fatty acid was higher. Ruminant also had higher levels of trans fatty acids. Lower amounts of saturated fatty acid and higher polyunsaturated fatty acid contents were found in poultry. The texture of pork and ruminant was firmer. Poultry was prone to oxidation and deterioration which was determined by the high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Compared with the meat products , viscera had higher saturated fatty acid and lower monounsaturated fatty acid contents. Fatty acids ratio was one of the most important factors on meat nutritional quality. It could be improved by regulating the nutrition in feed in order to achieve the ideal ratio.
