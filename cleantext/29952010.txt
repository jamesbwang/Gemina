  We evaluated the effect of global warming on Araucaria angustifolia ( Bert.) O. Kuntze , a critically endangered native tree of Southern Brazil , by studying the effects of short-term high-temperature treatment on cell viability , respiration<symptom> and DNA repair of embryogenic cells. Compared with control cells grown at 25 °C , cell viability was reduced by 40 % after incubation at 30 and 37 °C for 24 and 6h , respectively , while 2h at 40 and 42 °C killed 95 % of the cells. Cell respiration<symptom> was unaffected at 30-37 °C , but dramatically reduced after 2h at 42 °C. The in vitro activity of enzymes of the base excision repair ( BER) pathway was determined. AP endonuclease , measured in extracts from cells incubated for 2h at 42 °C , was completely inactivated while lower temperatures had no effect. The activities of three enzymes of the mitochondrial BER pathway were measured after 30 min preincubation of isolated mitochondria at 25-40 °C and one of them , uracil glycosylase , was completely inhibited by 40 °C. We conclude that cell viability , respiration<symptom> and DNA repair have different temperature sensitivities between 25 and 37
