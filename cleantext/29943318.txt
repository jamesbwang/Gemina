  Information about the role of micromammals in the epidemiology of Leishmania<pathogen> infantum and Babesia sp. in southern Europe is scarce. Wild micromammals were captured in natural areas in the Barcelona province ( NE Spain) in 2011 and analysed by real-time PCR for the presence of DNA of Piroplasmida ( n = 253) and Leishmania<pathogen> infantum ( n = 166). The wood mouse ( Apodemus<pathogen> sylvaticus) was the most abundant species , but all specimens tested negative for L. infantum , for which two out of 15 ( 13.3 %) white-toothed shrews ( Crocidura russula) and one out of 23 ( 4.3 %) Algerian mice ( Mus<pathogen> spretus) resulted positive. No individual was positive for Piroplasmida DNA. The role of wild micromammals in the epidemiology of these parasites in the study area seems negligible.
