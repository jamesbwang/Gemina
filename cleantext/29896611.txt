  An in-depth exploration associated with the localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR) effect for plasmonic photoelectrochemistry ( PEC) is beneficial for the development of high-efficiency biosensors. A novel phenomenon on the LSPR between g-C3N4/ Bi2MoO6 and gold nanoparticles is investigated in a PEC aptasensing system under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation.
