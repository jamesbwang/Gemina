  Although the United States offers some of the most advanced psychological services in the world , not everyone in U.S. shares equally in these services , and health disparities persist when assessments do not appropriately measure different populations ' mental health problems. To address this assessment issue , we conducted factor and Rasch analyses to assess the psychometric characteristics of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 ( BSI-18) to evaluate whether the BSI is culturally appropriate for assessing African Americans ' psychological distress. The dimensional structure of the BSI was first identified and held up under cross-validation with a second subsample. The measure was unidimensional among African Americans. Our results also suggested minimal person separation , stability across subsamples , and little differential item functioning. Most African Americans identified themselves on the low end of the categories in a 0-4 rating scale , indicating their low endorsement of the items on the BSI. Rasch analyses were completed with the original scale but also collapsing the scale to three points , with some increase in separation and reliability for the collapsed scale. Differences in mean person position were found for mental health-related variables , consistent with hypotheses. Implications for theory and research on multicultural health scales are discussed as are effects of severe item skewness on analyses.
