  Most reports in reversed-phase liquid chromatography ( RPLC) with micellar mobile phases make use of the anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate. This surfactant masks efficiently the silanol groups that are the origin of the poor efficiencies and tailing peaks observed for basic compounds in conventional RPLC. However , it has the handicap of yielding excessive retention , which forces the addition of an organic solvent to reduce the retention times to practical values. Other surfactants , such as the non-ionic polyoxyethylene ( 23) lauryl ether ( Brij-35) , are rarely used. Brij-35 allows the separation of a large range of analytes in adequate retention times , without the need of adding an organic solvent to the mobile phase. However , this non-ionic surfactant shows irreversible adsorption on chromatographic columns and peak shape is poorer. Therefore , the search of non-ionic surfactants with similar properties to Brij-35 , but showing reversible adsorption and better peak shape , can be of great interest. In this work , the adequacy of several non-ionic surfactants as modifiers in RPLC has been explored , being polyoxyethylene ( 10) tridecyl ether particularly attractive. The separation of different types of compounds was checked: sulfonamides ( acidic) , Î²-adrenoceptor antagonists and tricyclic antidepressants ( basic with diverse polarity) , and flavonoids ( with and without hydroxyl groups on the aromatic rings). The chromatographic behaviors were examined in terms of retention and peak shape. The results were compared with those obtained with Brij-35.
