  Glioma is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer , with some subtypes having 5-year survival rates of less than 5 %. Tumour cell invasion into the surrounding parenchyma seems to be the primary driver of these poor outcomes , as most gliomas recur within 2 cm of the original surgically-resected tumour. Many current approaches to the development of anticancer therapy attempt to target genetic weaknesses<symptom> in a particular cancer , but may not take into account the microenvironment experienced by a tumour and the patient-specific genetic differences in susceptibility to treatment. Here we demonstrate the use of complementary approaches , 3D bioprinting and scaffold-free 3D tissue culture , to examine the invasion of glioma cells into neural-like tissue with 3D confocal microscopy. We found that , while both approaches were successful , the use of 3D tissue culture for organoid development offers the advantage of broad accessibility. As a proof-of-concept of our approach , we developed a system in which we could model the invasion of human glioma cells into mouse neural progenitor cell-derived spheroids. We show that we can follow invasion of human tumour cells using cell-tracking dyes and 3D laser scanning confocal microscopy , both in real time and in fixed samples. We validated these results using conventional cryosectioning. Our scaffold-free 3D approach has broad applicability , as we were easily able to examine invasion using different neural progenitor cell lines , thus mimicking differences that might be observed in patient brain tissue. These results , once applied to iPSC-derived cerebral organoids that incorporate the somatic genetic variability of patients , offer the promise of truly personalized treatments for brain cancer.
