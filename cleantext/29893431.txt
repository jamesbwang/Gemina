  This study aims to explore the effects of miR-539 on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and osteoclast apoptosis in a rat model of osteoporosis , and its mechanism involving the regulation of the AXIN1-mediated wingless-Int ( Wnt) signaling pathway. A rat model of osteoporosis was successfully established by ovariectomy. With osteoblasts and osteoclasts of rats not receiving ovariectomy in the sham group as control , those of osteoporotic rats were treated with miR-539 inhibitor , miR-539 mimic , and AXIN1 shRNA. The expression of miR-53 , AXIN1 , the Wnt pathway related-genes , apoptosis related-genes , and osteogenic markers were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis , respectively. Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) activity in osteoblast and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP) activity in osteoclasts were determined after cell transfection. Osteoblast and osteoclast viability was assayed by CCK-8 assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteoclasts were detected by flow cytometry. Lastly , alizarin red S staining was used to detect mineralized nodules<symptom> of osteoblasts. Firstly , we determined that miR-539 was down-regulated in osteoblast and osteoclast of osteoporotic rats and AXIN1 was negatively regulated by miR-539. Additionally , overexpression of miR-539 increased the expressions of β-catenin , LEF1 , c-myc , cyclin D1 , RUNX2 , BGP , BMP-2 in osteoblast as well as β-catenin , RhoA , caspase-3 , and Bcl-2 in osteoclasts. Finally , overexpression of miR-539 elevated ALP activity , proliferation , and mineralized nodules<symptom> in osteoblast and osteoclast apoptosis , with reduced TRAP activity in osteoclasts. Our results demonstrate that miR-539 promotes osteoblast proliferation and differentiation as well as osteoclast apoptosis through the AXIN1-dependent Wnt signaling pathway in osteoporotic rats.
