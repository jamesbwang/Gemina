  Carbon nanoparticles such graphene , carbon nanotubes , and carbon dots offer the potential to improve environmental treatment technologies due to their unique properties such as low toxicity and high metal sorption capacity. However , there are no studies on facilitated transport and remobilization of pre-sorbed metals by carbon dot ( CD) nanoparticles in quartz sand columns. Here , we investigate the effects of solution ionic strength ( IS; 1 , 100 and 200 mM NaCl) and pH ( Chen et al. , 2017; Chen et al. , 2010; Cornell and Schwertmann , 2006) , initial CD concentration ( 200 , 400 , 600 and 800 mg L
