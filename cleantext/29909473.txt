  Laccases , multicopper oxidoreductases , are mainly produced in white-rot fungi<pathogen> and are considered as ideal green catalysts in industrial and biotechnological applications. However , the development of laccases is limited due to the slow growth of natural laccase producing strains and the low expression levels of laccases. In this study , we designed three regulation strategies for laccase gene expression in the model fungus Aspergillus<pathogen> nidulans<pathogen> By introducing various promoters in front of the laccase gene pslcc from the white-rot fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus<pathogen> , we found that the laccase gene with the original promoter had effective expression in A.<pathogen> nidulans<pathogen>. Using the previously identified transcription factor RsmA regulatory mechanism , the aflR promoter was inserted into the pslcc expression vectors , and the laccase production was 15-fold higher in the strain overexpressing of RsmA compared to the control strain. To improve the laccase yield , the dipeptidyl-peptidase DppV , aspartic protease PepA and mannosyltransferase Mnn9 were successfully deleted in the A nidulans host. The laccase activities were increased approximately 8-fold and 13-fold in the double deletions strains of Δmnn9ΔpepA and ΔdppVΔpepA over the control strains , respectively. Taken together , these results not only demonstrate an efficient system for heterologous protein production in the model fungus A.<pathogen> nidulans<pathogen> but also provide a general approach to applying regulatory methods to control gene expression.
