  Paragangliomas ( PGLs) are catecholamine-secreting neoplasms of chromaffin cells and represent a rare but curable cause of secondary hypertension. Surgery is the treatment of choice for symptomatic PGLs. A small ( 7 mm) extra-adrenal PGL was diagnosed in the right retroperitoneal space in a 19-year-old patient affected by symptomatic hypertension unresponsive to medical treatment. Indication to percutaneous radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) was given by a multidisciplinary team on the basis of the size of the nodule<disease> , the surgical risks , the young age of the patient , and his wish to reduce as much as possible the post-interventional rehabilitation. To our knowledge , the use of percutaneous RFA in the treatment of retroperitoneal extra-adrenal primary paragangliomas has never been described. We describe its feasibility and the patient 's clinical outcome.
