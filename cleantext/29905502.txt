  Using data from HIV<pathogen> Prevention Trials Network 064 , a multisite , observational cohort study conducted to estimate HIV<pathogen> incidence rates among women living in areas of high poverty and HIV<pathogen> prevalence in the United States , we examined the use of HIV<pathogen> risk characteristics to predict emotional abuse , physical violence , and forced sex. Participants included 2099 women , 18-44 years of age , who reported unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a male partner and an additional personal or perceived male partner HIV<pathogen> risk characteristic in the past 6 months. Adjusting for time-varying covariates , generalized estimating equations were used to assess the ability of HIV<pathogen> risk characteristics to predict violence 6 months later. Reported analyses were limited to the 1980 study participants who reported having a male sex partner at that assessment. Exchanging sex , perceived partner concurrency , and perceived partner incarceration were significantly predictive of emotional abuse 6 months later ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR): 1.60; 1.59; 1.34 , respectively). Prior sexually transmitted infection diagnosis , exchanging sex , and binge drinking were significantly predictive of physical violence 6 months later ( AOR: 1.62; 1.71; 1.47 , respectively). None of the variables measured was significantly predictive of forced sex. Strategies that address reducing violence against women should be studied further in the context of HIV<pathogen> prevention programs.
