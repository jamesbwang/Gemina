  The increasing production and use of engineered silver nanoparticles ( AgNP) in industry and private households are leading to increased concentrations of AgNP in the environment. An ecological risk assessment of AgNP is needed , but it requires understanding the long term effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of AgNP on the soil microbiome. Hence , the aim of this study was to reveal the long-term effects of AgNP on soil microorganisms. The study was conducted as a laboratory incubation experiment over a period of one year using a loamy soil and AgNP concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 mg AgNP/kg soil. The short term effects of AgNP were , in general , limited. However , after one year of exposure to 0.01 mg AgNP/kg , there were significant negative effects on soil microbial biomass ( quantified by extractable DNA; p = 0.000) and bacterial ammonia<pathogen> oxidizers ( quantified by amoA gene copy numbers; p = 0.009). Furthermore , the tested AgNP concentrations significantly decreased the soil microbial biomass , the leucine aminopeptidase activity ( quantified by substrate turnover; p = 0.014) , and the abundance of nitrogen fixing microorganisms ( quantified by nifH gene copy numbers; p = 0.001). The results of the positive control with AgNO3 revealed predominantly stronger effects due to Ag
