  Pheochromocytoma , especially for noncatecholamine-secreting pheochromocytoma , is an extremely rare cause of ectopic corticotrophin-releasing hormone ( CRH) syndrome<disease>. A 27-year-old Chinese woman was administered dexamethasone for a skin allergy , but her general condition rapidly deteriorated over a month. She was subsequently hospitalized for typical clinical features of Cushing 's syndrome<disease>. Endocrinological investigation confirmed severe hypercortisolism along with elevated plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone ( ACTH). However , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) revealed no pituitary adenoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CT) revealed a 6.5 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with mildly contrast enhancement. The tumor was found during a routine physical check-up at a local hospital 16 months ago; however , the patient did not have any symptoms and did not seek further medical attention at that time. Laparoscopic resection of the right adrenal tumor led to a rapid remission of Cushing 's syndrome<disease>. Based on pathological findings and the presence of normal catecholamine metabolites in her serum and urine , the patient was diagnosed with noncatecholamine-secreting pheochromocytoma. Immunohistochemical staining of the adrenal tumor revealed positive staining for CRH and negative staining for ACTH. This is an extremely rare case of ectopic CRH syndrome<disease> caused by an adrenal noncatecholamine-secreting pheochromocytoma. Both ectopic ACTH syndrome<disease> and ectopic CRH syndrome<disease> should be considered in patients presenting with ACTH-dependent Cushing 's syndrome<disease> caused by extrapituitary diseases.
