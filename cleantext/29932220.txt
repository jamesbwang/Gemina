  Patients who travel a long distance ( ≥ 50 miles) for cancer care have improved outcomes. However , to the authors ' knowledge , the prevalence of long travel distances for treatment by patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) , and the effect of travel distance on overall survival ( OS) , remains unknown. The authors used the National Cancer Data base from 2004 through 2013 to identify patients with HNSCC undergoing definitive treatment. Travel distance for treatment was categorized as short ( < 12.5 miles) , intermediate ( 12.5-49.9 miles) , and long ( 50-249.9 miles). The primary outcome , OS , was evaluated using Cox shared-frailty modeling. A secondary outcome , factors associated with intermediate and long travel distances , was evaluated using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression. Among 118,000 patients with HNSCC , 62,753 ( 53.2 %) , 40,644 ( 34.4 %) , and 14,603 ( 12.4 %) patients , respectively , traveled short , intermediate , and long distances for treatment. After adjusting for relevant covariates , long travel distance was associated with treatment at academic and high-volume centers. Patients of black race , of Hispanic ethnicity , with Medicaid insurance , and who were treated with nonsurgical treatment were less likely to travel long distances for treatment ( P < .001). Traveling a long distance for treatment was associated with improved OS on multivariable analysis ( adjusted hazard ratio , 0.93; 95 % confidence interval , 0.89-0.96) compared with a short distance. Traveling a long distance for HNSCC treatment is associated with improved survival , especially for patients receiving nonsurgical management. Racial and ethnic disparities in travel for HNSCC treatment exist. As regionalization of care continues , future work should identify and address reasons for racial and ethnic disparities in travel that may prevent access to care at high-volume facilities.
