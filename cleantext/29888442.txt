  Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production using sustainable sunlight is a promising alternative to industrial hydrogen production. However , the scarcity of highly active , recyclable , inexpensive photocatalysts impedes the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) schemes. Herein , a metal-organic framework ( MOF)- template strategy was developed to prepare non-noble metal co-catalyst/solid solution heterojunction NiS/Zn
