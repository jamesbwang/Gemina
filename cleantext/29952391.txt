  Namib Desert beetles harvest water from harsh environments by using their hydrophilic-hydrophobic dorsal surfaces. Generally , Cassie-state superhydrophobic materials are chosen as substrates to prepare bioinspired ( super) hydrophilic/ ( super) hydrophobic patterned surfaces. However , due to the low adhesion and strong repellency , aqueous solution can not be directly set on Cassie superhydrophobic materials until the dropping volume is larger than 6.5 μL. Therefore , arranging a ( super) hydrophilic substance on Cassie superhydrophobic substrates to construct ( super) hydrophilic/superhydrophobic patterned surfaces still remains a challenge. In this work , by prewetting with dichloromethane ( DCM) , the mussel-inspired hydrophilic and bio-adhesive dopamine solution ( DA) could be dripped onto a Cassie superhydrophobic Cu surface with an ultralow volume of 0.1 μL , whereby low surface tension DCM would `` cloak '' the high surface tension DA. Along with DCM volatility , DA was adhered on the Cassie superhydrophobic surface and would then self-polymerize into hydrophilic polydopamine domains , thus hydrophilic/superhydrophobic patterned surfaces with efficient water collection could be successfully developed inspired by Namib Desert beetles and mussels. The bioinspired materials show the potential for real-world industrialization in a large scale , which is of great significance for providing living security for those living in areas with no access to fresh water.
