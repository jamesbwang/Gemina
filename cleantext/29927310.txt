  Ischemic cardiomyopathy ( ICM) is characterized by accumulation of p53 causing apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and resulting in upregulation of miRNA ( miR) -192 , which plays an important role in the development of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> after acute myocardial infarction. However , for other cardiomyopathies , miR-192 seems to have minor relevance. We tested in a prospective , observational study comprising 91 patients with diagnosed heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 59.3 % ICM and 40.7 % non-ICM) , the hypothesis that miR-192 expression predicts survival in patients with ICM. Median follow-up was 59 months ( range: 1-118). While miR-192 expression was significantly associated with age ( p = 0.028) , log-rank analysis revealed significant association with survival in ICM ( p = 0.003) but not in non-ICM ( p = 0.6). In ICM , median age at time of death was 84 years in patients with low miR-192 expression but 67 years with high miR-192 expression. Thus , miR-192 expression is associated with survival in ICM and represents a prognostic marker in ischemic
