  Targeted top-down ( TD) and middle-down ( MD) mass spectrometry ( MS) offer reduced sample manipulation during protein analysis , limiting the risk of introducing artifactual modifications to better capture sequence information on the proteoforms present. This provides some advantages when characterizing biotherapeutic molecules such as monoclonal antibodies , particularly for the class of biosimilars. Here , we describe the results obtained analyzing a monoclonal IgG1 , either in its ∼ 150 kDa intact form or after highly specific digestions yielding ∼ 25 and ∼ 50 kDa subunits , using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer on a liquid chromatography ( LC) time scale with fragmentation from ion-photon , ion-ion , and ion-neutral interactions. Ultraviolet photodissociation ( UVPD) used a new 213 nm solid-state laser. Alternatively , we applied high-capacity electron-transfer dissociation ( ETD HD) , alone or in combination with higher energy collisional dissociation ( EThcD). Notably , we verify the degree of complementarity of these ion activation methods , with the combination of 213 nm UVPD and ETD HD producing a new record sequence coverage of ∼ 40 % for TD MS experiments. The addition of EThcD for the > 25 kDa products from MD strategies generated up to 90 % of complete sequence information in six LC runs. Importantly , we determined an optimal signal-to-noise threshold for fragment ion deconvolution to suppress false positives yet maximize sequence coverage and implemented a systematic validation of this process using the new software TDValidator. This rigorous data analysis should elevate confidence for assignment of dense MS
