  This qualitative study aimed to explore the psychological effects of female genital cutting in the United Kingdom within a systemic psychological framework. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 13 women who had experienced female genital cutting. Four key themes emerged from thematic analysis of the data: ( 1) wholeness contested , ( 2) sexuality milestones and female genital cutting awareness , ( 3) salvaging family relationships and ( 4) for our own good. Findings highlight the importance of recognising the relational nature of how women perceive the psychological effects of female genital cutting and how these reactions are negotiated in their social sphere.
