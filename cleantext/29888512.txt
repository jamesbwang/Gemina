  To investigate medication , rehospitalizations and mortality after first-episode hospital-treated psychosis. A population-based nation-wide cohort ( n = 2488) with a first hospitalization for psychosis at ages between 16 and 25 was identified. Cases were followed for up to 5 years after the first psychosis hospitalization with regard to mortality , hospitalizations and dispensations of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. The proportion of patients dispensing antipsychotics decreased from 80 % year 1 after first discharge to 55 % year 5. The proportion of patients having episodes of inpatient care also decreased year by year from 46 % year 1 to 27 % year 5. Of 863 cases with 5 years of observation time 41 % had dispensations of antipsychotics every year; 21 % had no dispensation of antipsychotics or hospitalization after the first year. The cumulative 5-year mortality was 3.9 %. Cumulative suicide mortality was 2.4 %. Incidence of suicide was highest in the first year. Male gender , benzodiazepines , recent hospital-discharge and self-harm were identified as risk factors for suicide. The proportion of cases dispensing antipsychotics decreases year by year after first discharge. Mortality and rates of rehospitalization also decrease year by year from high levels the first year.
