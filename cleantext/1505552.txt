  It is well recognized that cardio- vascular risk factors lead to histological and functional changes in aorta , and aortic stiffness is the best predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this study we evaluated the relation of a less evaluated echocardiographic parameter of aortic stiffness , aortic propagation velocity ( APV) with the presence and severity of CAD. This cross sectional study was conducted from May 2015 to March 2016 in Imam Reza hospital , Mashhad , Iran. Seventy patients who were referred for elective coronary artery angiography were enrolled. Patients were divided into two sub-groups based on angiographic findings: patients with CAD ( 38 patients , 54.3 %) and non-CAD ( 32 patients , 45.7 %). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using the conventional 2D and color M-Mode imaging. Aortic propagation velocity ( APV) , aortic strain ( AS) and distensibility ( AD) were measured. The presence and Severity of CAD ( assessing by syntax score) and their relation with aortic stiffness indices were assessed. Aortic strain ( 6.23 ± 1.93 % versus 11.66 ± 4.86 % , P < 0.0001) , distensibility ( 2.46 ± 0.91 vs 5.57 ± 2.25 cm 2 dyn-110-3 , P < 0.0001) and APV ( 48.63 ± 10.31 cm/sec vs 77.75 ± 9.97 cm/s , P < 0.0001) were significantly decreased in CAD group compared with non-CAD group. In our study , APV showed significant inverse relationship with CAD. Based on our results , APV less than 56 cm/sec could be used to predict CAD with sensitivity and specificity of 96.9 and 78.9 % respectively. We also found an inverse correlation between APV and severity of CAD. Aortic strain , AD and APV ( a less evaluated echocardiographic index) showed significant inverse correlation with presence and severity of CAD.
