  Assembly , maintenance and function of synaptic junctions depend on extracellular matrix ( ECM) proteins and their receptors. Here we report that Tenectin ( Tnc) , a Mucin-type protein with RGD motifs , is an ECM component required for the structural and functional integrity of synaptic specializations at the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ) in
