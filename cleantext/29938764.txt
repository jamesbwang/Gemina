  Historically , planarian neoblasts were thought to be a homogeneous population of pluripotent stem cells; however , recent population and single-cell level analyses have refuted this idea. Evidence for lineage commitment at the neoblast level has been provided via a number of independent studies using a variety of methods. In situ hybridization experiments first demonstrated the co-expression of lineage-specific markers in neoblasts ( marked by piwi-1 expression) isolated by FACS. Subsequently , single cell transcriptomic analyses of FACS-isolated neoblasts uncovered broad lineage-primed neoblast classes based on the clustering of transcriptional profiles and expression of known tissue-specific markers. Additionally , single neoblast pluripotency ( and fate restriction) has been demonstrated by single cell transplantation experiments into neoblast-void animals. Here we look to recount the current status of the planarian neoblast field and offer discussion on the caveats of neoblast biology and how to address them experimentally.
