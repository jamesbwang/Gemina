  The activity of thousands of excitatory synapse in the dendritic tree produces variations of membrane potential which , while can produce the spike generation at soma ( hillock) , can also influence the output of a single glutamatergic synapse. We used a model of synaptic diffusion and EPSP generation to simulate the effect of different number of active synapses on the output of a single one. Our results show that , also in subthreshold conditions , the excitatory dendritic activity can influence several parameters of the single synaptic output such as its amplitude , its time course , the NMDA-component activation and consequently phenomena like STP and LTP.
