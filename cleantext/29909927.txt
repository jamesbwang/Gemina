  Implantation rates of hypoglossal nerve stimulators , such as INSPIRE , are increasing. The device is still in its early stages of complication reporting , which to date includes implant related infection requiring device removal , and stimulation lead cuff dislodgement requiring replacement. Here we present a 48-year-old female who experienced generator migration and stimulator lead tension requiring an additional operation in order to resecure the generator device. This proved unsuccessful and a second surgery was performed with complete relocation of the device generator to inhibit device migration. This is the first documented case of INSPIRE migration to date , though the implant generator has comparable likeness to cardiovascular implantable electronic devices ( CIEDs) where migration risk factors are better studied. Given our patient 's case , we identify obesity and abundant breast tissue as potential risk factors for device migration. We believe such factors can be identified prior to initial device implantation to avoid migration and the need for surgical revision. Superior positioning of the generator proved successful , and can be a solution in those with similar body habitus as TYRX pouching and additional security sutures were ineffective. Also , for revisions requiring tunneling of the stimulation lead as in this case we recommend the use of zero degree endoscope for ease of adhesion lysis.
