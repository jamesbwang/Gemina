  In the proper context , radiation therapy ( RT) can promote anti-tumor immunity. It is unknown if elective nodal irradiation ( ENI) , a strategy that irradiates tumor-associated draining lymph nodes ( DLN) , impacts adaptive immune responses and combinatorial efficacy of RT with immune checkpoint blockade ( ICB). We developed a preclinical model to compare stereotactic RT ( Tumor RT) with or without ENI to examine immunological differences between RT techniques that spare or irradiate the DLN. Tumor RT was associated with up-regulation of an intratumoral T-cell chemoattractant chemokine signature ( CXCR3 , CCR5-related) that resulted in robust infiltration of antigen-specific CD8 + effector T-cells as well as FoxP3 + regulatory T-cells ( Tregs). The addition of ENI attenuated chemokine expression , restrained immune infiltration and adversely impacted survival when combined with ICB , especially with anti-CLTA4 therapy. The combination of stereotactic RT and ICB led to long-term survival in a subset of mice and was associated with favorable CD8 effector-to-Treg ratios and increased intratumoral density of antigen-specific CD8 + T-cells. While RT technique ( Tumor RT vs. ENI) impacted initial tumor control and survival , the ability to reject tumor upon re-challenge was partially dependent upon the mechanism of action of ICB; as RT/anti-CTLA 4 was superior to RT/anti-PD -1. Our results highlight that irradiation of the DLN restrains adaptive immune responses through altered chemokine expression and CD8 + T-cell trafficking. These data have implications for combining RT and ICB , long-term survival and induction of immunological memory. Clinically , the immunomodulatory effect of the RT strategy should be considered when combining stereotactic RT with immunotherapy.
