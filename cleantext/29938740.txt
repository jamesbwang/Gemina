  There is an increasing interest in the medical use of cannabis , particularly in the treatment of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. The aim is to evaluate the effects of cannabis use and the associated benefits reported by patients with various chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> diagnoses. A total of 338 patients with different chro- nic pain conditions were treated with a Cannabis Flos 19 % decoction for 12 months , in addition to their pharmacological therapy. Baseline levels for pain medications , pain intensity , pain disability , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> were recorded at 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months. Pain intensity records a statistically significant reduction from Baseline to 12 months follow up ( X ² 61.375; P < 0,001); the im- provements from Baseline to 12 months follow up are also recorded in pain disability ( X ² 39.423; P < 0,001) and in anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms ( X ² 30.362; P < 0,001; X ² 27.786; P < 0,001). Our study suggest that Cannabis therapy , as an adjun- ct a traditional analgesic therapy , can be an efficacious tool to make more effective the management of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and its consequences on functional and psychological dimension. Further randomized , controlled trials are needed to confirm our conclusions.
