  This multicenter cross-sectional study aimed to determine the differences in distribution and fracture pattern between low-energy and high-energy groups in distal humeral fractures in Japan. Retrospectively , 133 patients ( 48 males , 85 females) with distal humeral fractures were enrolled in this study. The age , sex , fracture classification , injury mechanism , preoperative therapy for osteoporosis , and nature of soft-tissue injury were recorded for all patients. The Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test or Fisher 's exact test were used for non-normally distributed variables and categorical variables , respectively , to compare differences between the two groups. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 66 years ( range 21-99 years). Marked differences were observed between the two groups in terms of age , sex , and fracture pattern. The mean age of patients with AO classification type A2 fractures was significantly higher than that of the patients with other fracture types. In contrast , the mean age of patients with AO classification type C2 fractures was slightly lower than that of the remainder of the population. In the low-energy trauma group , females accounted for 72.2 % of fractures and their mean age at the time of surgery was 76 years. Low-energy trauma among elderly individuals was prominent.
