  The DNA replisome inevitably encounters DNA damage during DNA replication. The T7 DNA replisome contains a DNA polymerase ( gp5) , the processivity factor thioredoxin ( trx) , a helicase-primase ( gp4) , and a ssDNA-binding protein ( gp2 .5). T7 protein interactions mediate this DNA replication. However , whether the protein interactions could promote DNA damage bypass is still little addressed. In this study , we investigated strand-displacement DNA synthesis past 8-oxoG or O
