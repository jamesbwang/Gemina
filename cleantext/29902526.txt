  Protein biomarkers are important diagnostic tools for cancer and several other diseases. To be validated in a clinical context , a biomarker should satisfy some requirements including the ability to provide reliable information on a pathological state by measuring its expression levels. In parallel , the development of an approach capable of detecting biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity would be ideally suited for clinical applications. Here , we performed an immune-based label free assay using Surface Plasmon Resonance ( SPR)- based detection of the soluble form of E-cadherin , a cell-cell contact protein that is involved in the maintaining of tissue integrity. With this approach , we obtained a specific and quantitative detection of E-cadherin from a few hundred microliters of serum of breast cancer patients by obtaining a 10-fold enhancement in the detection limit over a traditional colorimetric ELISA.
