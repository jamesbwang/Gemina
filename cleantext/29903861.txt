  We investigated whether the combination of increased fraction of exhaled nitric oxide ( FeNO) level and blood eosinophil count had an additive value in chronic airway disease in the general population.We included 4677 individuals aged 20-100 years from the Copenhagen General Population Study. Based on pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry , self-reported asthma , and smoking history , participants were subdivided into: healthy never-smokers ( n = 1649) , healthy ever-smokers ( n = 1581) , asthma ( n = 449) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) ( n = 404) , asthma-COPD overlap ( ACO) ( n = 138) , and non-specific airflow limitation ( n = 456). Compared to individuals with FeNO < 25 ppb and blood eosinophils < 0.3 Ã— 10
