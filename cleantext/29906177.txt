  We measure the static frictional resistance and the real area of contact between two solid blocks subjected to a normal load. We show that following a two-step change in the normal load the system exhibits nonmonotonic aging and memory effects , two hallmarks of glassy dynamics. These dynamics are strongly influenced by the discrete geometry of the frictional interface , characterized by the attachment and detachment of unique microcontacts. The results are in good agreement with a theoretical model we propose that incorporates this geometry into the framework recently used to describe Kovacs-like relaxation in glasses as well as thermal disordered systems. These results indicate that a frictional interface is a glassy system and strengthen the notion that nonmonotonic relaxation behavior is generic in such systems.
