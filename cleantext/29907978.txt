  Organoboron chemistry is a new tool to tune the electronic structures and properties of conjugated polymers , which are important for applications in organic optoelectronic devices. To investigate the effects of substituents of boron atoms on conjugated polymers , we synthesized three conjugated polymers based on double B ‚Üê N-bridged bipyridine ( BNBP) with various substituents on the boron atoms. By changing the substituents from four phenyl groups and two phenyl groups/two fluorine atoms to four fluorine atoms , the BNBP-based polymers show blue-shifted absorption spectra , decreased LUMO/HOMO energy levels , and enhanced electron affinities , as well as increased electron mobilities. Moreover , these BNBP-based polymers can be used as electron acceptors for all-polymer solar cells. These results demonstrate that substituents of boron atoms can effectively modulate the electronic properties and applications of conjugated polymers.
