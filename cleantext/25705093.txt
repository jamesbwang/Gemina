  The identification of activated T-lymphocytes restricted to myelin-derived immunogenic peptides in multiple sclerosis ( MS) and aquaporin-4 water channel in neuromyelitis optica ( NMO) in the blood of patients opened the possibility for developing highly selective and disease-specific therapeutic approaches. Antigen presenting cells and in particular dendritic cells ( DCs) represent a strategy to inhibit pro-inflammatory T helper cells. DCs are located in peripheral and lymphoid tissues and are essential for homeostasis of T cell-dependent immune responses. The expression of a particular set of receptors involved in pathogen recognition confers to DCs the property to initiate immune responses. However , in the absence of danger signals different DC subsets have been revealed to induce active tolerance by inducing regulatory T cells , inhibiting pro-inflammatory T helper cells responses or both. Interestingly , several protocols to generate clinical-grade tolerogenic DC ( Tol-DC)
