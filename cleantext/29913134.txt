  Nucleic acid-based aptamers are promising alternative to antibodies , however , their selection process ( SELEX) is challenging. A number of simulations and few experiments have been reported offering insights into experimental factors ( EFs) that govern the effectiveness of the selection process. Though useful , these previous studied were either lack of experimental confirmation , or considered limited EFs. A more efficient experimental method is highly desired. In this study , we developed a fast method that is capable to quantitatively probe the influence of multiple EFs. Based on the fact that the aptamer enrichment efficiency is highly affected by background binding , the binding ratio between the numbers of specific aptamer binders and nonspecific ( unselected library) binders per bead was used to quantitatively evaluate EF effects. Taking thrombin and streptavidin as models , three previously studied EFs ( surface coverage , buffer composition , and DNA concentration) and four never-studied ones ( surface chemistry , heat treatment , elution methodology and pool purity) were investigated. The EFs greatly affected binding ratio ( ranging from 0.03 ± 0.03 to 14.60 ± 2.30). The results were in good agreement with the literature , suggesting the good feasibility of our method. Our study provides guidance for the choice of EFs not only for aptamer selection , but also for binding evaluation of aptamers.
