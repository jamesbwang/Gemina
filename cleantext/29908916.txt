  To screen chickens and pigs slaughtered for human consumption for presence and characteristics of extended spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL) and plasmidic AmpC ( pAmpC) beta-lactamase-producing enteric bacteria. Faecal samples from 410 broiler chickens and 100 pigs were cultured on MacConkey agar supplemented with 2Î¼g/ml cefotaxime. The antibacterial resistance phenotypes of the recovered isolates were determined by disc-diffusion method while PCR and subsequent sequencing was performed to identify the ESBL and pAmpC gene variants and other associated resistance determinants. Genetic diversity of the isolates was analyzed by phylotyping and multi-locus sequence typing. ESBL-producing Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , Enterobacter<pathogen> asburiae<pathogen> and Providencia<pathogen> spp. were isolated from 17 ( 4.1 %) and 2 ( 2.0 %) of the samples from chickens and pigs , respectively. One pAmpC-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolate was obtained from a chicken. Co-resistance to tetracycline , sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim , chloramphenicol and gentamicin was exhibited by 95 % , 80 % , 60 % and 55 % of the ESBL/pAmpC strains , respectively. tet ( A) and aac ( 3)- II were the predominant genes detected in the tetracycline- and aminoglycoside-resistant strains. bla Healthy chickens and pigs act as reservoirs of ESBL/pAmpC-producing enterobacteria that can be potentially transmitted to humans through direct contact or ingestion of contaminated meat.
