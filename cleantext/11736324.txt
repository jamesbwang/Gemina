  We consider vortex dynamics in the context of Bose-Einstein condensates ( BECs) with a rotating trap , with or without anisotropy. Starting with the Gross-Pitaevskii ( GP) partial differential equation ( PDE) , we derive a novel reduced system of ordinary differential equations ( ODEs) that describes stable configurations of multiple co-rotating vortices ( vortex crystals). This description is found to be quite accurate
