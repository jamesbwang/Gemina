  Premature leaf senescence in rice is one of the most common factors affecting the plant 's development and yield. Although methyltransferases are involved in diverse biological functions , their roles in rice leaf senescence have not been previously reported. In this study , we identified the premature leaf senescence 3 ( pls3) mutant in rice , which led to early leaf senescence and early heading date. Further investigations revealed that premature leaf senescence was triggered by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Using physiological analysis , we found that chlorophyll content was reduced in the pls3 mutant leaves , while hydrogen peroxide ( H
