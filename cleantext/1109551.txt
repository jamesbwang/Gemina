  Long QT syndrome<disease> ( LQTS) is a congenital disorder characterized by prolongation of QT interval in the electrocardiogram ( ECG) and a propensity to develop ventricular arrhythmias , which may lead to syncope , cardiac arrest or sudden death. T-wave alternans ( TWA) , a phenomenon of beat-to-beat variability in the repolarization phase of the ventricles , has been closely associated with an increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events ( VTE) and sudden cardiac death ( SCD).
