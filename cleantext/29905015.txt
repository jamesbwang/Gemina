  The aortic valve is normally composed of 3 cusps. In one common lesion<symptom> , 2 cusps are fused together. The conjoined area of the fused cusps is termed raphe. Occurring in 1 % to 2 % of the population , the bicuspid aortic valve ( BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac malformation. The majority of BAV patients eventually require surgery. There is a lack in the literature regarding modeling of the raphe ( geometry and material properties) , its role and its influence on BAV function. The present study aims to propose improvements on these aspects. Three patient-specific finite element models of BAVs were created based on 3D trans-esophageal echocardiography measurements , and assuming age-dependent material properties. The raphe was initially given the same material properties as its underlying cusps. Two levels of validation were performed; one based on the anatomical validation of the pressurized geometry in diastole ( involving 7 anatomical measures) , as simulated starting from the unpressurized geometry , and the other based on a functional assessment using clinical measurements in both systole and diastole ( involving 16 functional measures). The pathology was successfully reproduced in the FE models of all 3 patients. To further investigate the role of the raphe , 2 additional scenarios were considered; ( 1) the raphe was considered as almost rigid , ( 2) the raphe was totally removed. The results confirmed the interpretation of the raphe as added stiffness in the fused cusp 's rotation with respect to the aortic wall , as well as added support for stress distribution from the fused cusps to the aortic wall.
