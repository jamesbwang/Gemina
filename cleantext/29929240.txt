  Although the influence of suspended particulate matter ( SPM) on denitrifying activity has been identified in river waters recently through metabolic incubations and community gene analysis , the regulations of SPM to denitrification in marine systems are still poorly understood. In the present study , the effects of suspended particle properties ( including concentration , composition and size) on potential denitrification were explored in the coastal Beibu Gulf water columns based on a series of
