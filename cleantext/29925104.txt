  An important milestone in the recovery following total knee replacement ( TKR) is the ability to return to driving. With advances in pain control and the widespread introduction of rapid rehab programs , we hypothesized that the ability to drive would also return sooner than had been traditionally observed. In our group of consecutive right TKR patients , using a driving simulator , we showed that at the 2-week mark , 36 of the 40 patients tested had returned to their preoperative driving capabilities and the other 4 had reached baseline at 3 weeks. While the eventual decision to return to driving is complex and dependent on many factors , we conclude that one of the benefits of enhanced pain and rehab protocols is that patients undergoing right TKR can return to driving in most instances at the 2-week mark rather than the traditional 6-week mark.
