  Nocardia<pathogen> , a Gram-positive bacterium<pathogen> , is responsible for rare and severe infections. Accurate microbiological data are essential to guide antibiotic treatment. Our primary objective was to describe species identification and results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( AST) for Nocardia isolates analysed over a 6-year period. Secondary objectives were to study temporal trends in species distribution and AST results. We retrospectively analysed results from Nocardia isolates sent between January 2010 and December 2015 to a French laboratory dedicated to Nocardia ( Observatoire Fran√ßais des Nocardioses). Species identification was obtained by amplification and sequencing of a 600bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene ( for all isolates) and of hsp65 ( when required). AST was performed using disk diffusion. We included 793 Nocardia<pathogen> isolates , mostly from the lungs ( 53.8 %). The most frequent species were N.<pathogen> farcinica<pathogen> ( 20.2 %) , N.<pathogen> abscessus<pathogen> complex ( 19.9 %) and N.<pathogen> nova<pathogen> complex ( 19.5 %). The proportion of N.<pathogen> farcinica<pathogen> increased significantly over time from 13 % in 2010 to 27.6 % in 2014. Linezolid , amikacin , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , minocycline , and imipenem were the most frequently identified active antibiotics with , respectively , 0 % ( 0/734) , 2.9 % ( 21/730) , 5.4 % ( 40/734) , 9.4 % ( 69/734) and 19.5 % ( 143/732) of isolates not susceptible. N.<pathogen> farcinica<pathogen> was frequently not susceptible to cefotaxime ( 118/148 , 79.7 % of the isolates) , but only about 5 % of N.<pathogen> cyriacigeorgica<pathogen> and N.<pathogen> abscessus<pathogen> complex isolates were not susceptible to cefotaxime. In this first epidemiological study of Nocardia<pathogen> isolated from human samples in France , N.<pathogen> farcinica<pathogen> was the species most frequently identified and its prevalence increased over time.
