  The hydroxyl radical , as the most important oxidant , controls the removal of some volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) in the atmosphere. In this work , the atmospheric oxidation processes of acrylic acid by OH radical have been investigated by density functional theory ( DFT). The energetic routes of the reaction of CH
