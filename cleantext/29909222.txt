  Ovarian cancer remains the leading cause of gynecologic cancer death among American women. Prevention is the only proven approach to reduce the incidence of the disease. Oral contraception , tubal ligation , and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy ( rrBSO) for high-risk groups are all established risk reduction strategies. This paradigm is changing as recent biologic studies suggest that many ovarian cancers , especially high-grade serous ovarian cancers , originate in the distal end of the fallopian tube rather than the ovarian surface epithelium. A putative precursor lesion<symptom> has been identified called the serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma ( STIC). Theoretically , removal of the fallopian tubes alone may prevent these lesions<symptom> and prevent overt disease. Opportunistic salpingectomy during benign gynecologic surgery appears to be safe and may offer some protection from ovarian cancer without compromising ovarian endocrine function. Despite a lack of evidence for efficacy , several professional societies now recommend this approach for average-risk women. Whether salpingectomy can also serve as a temporizing measure to delay risk-reducing oophorectomy in women with a genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer remains to be seen. Several ongoing non-randomized clinical trials will test the feasibility of this approach. Therefore , the societal impact of increasing salpingectomy rates on ovarian cancer incidence will be an area of intense focus for the next 10-20 years.
