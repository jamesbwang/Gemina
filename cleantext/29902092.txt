  Bacteremia and healthcare-associated infections ( HAIs) continue to rise in industrialized countries , in line with population aging and increased healthcare needs. Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> are the most common pathogens causing HAIs and bacteremia. Areas covered: This review discusses risk factors in the healthcare setting contributing to the rise in bacteremia and other invasive bacterial HAIs in older populations in general , and attributed to E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. Treatment of infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to emerging antimicrobial resistance. Prophylactic vaccines may be the solution to lowering the burden of serious infections in the elderly. Expert commentary: E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> vaccines routinely administered to older adults and to people undergoing prescheduled procedures with high infection risks could prevent a significant proportion of severe disease , and could potentially also limit the further emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
