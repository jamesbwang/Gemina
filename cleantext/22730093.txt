  This study aimed to determine the value of clinical prognostic factors and semiquantitative metabolic parameters from initial staging fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( F-18 FDG PET/CT) in non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL) patients treated with stem cell transplantation ( SCT). A total of 39 malignant lymphoma patients who underwent initial staging F-18 FDG PET/CT were enrolled in this study. SUVmax , MTV_wb , and TLG_wb were measured during the initial staging PET/CT. Receiver operating characteristic curve ( ROC) analysis was adopted to dichotomize continuous variables. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used to evaluate disease-free survival ( DFS) rate. Among the 39 patients with malignant lymphoma , 17 ( 43.6 %) had a relapse. For several clinical factors such as age , ECOG performance score , AMC/ALC score , stages , and revised International Prognostic Index score , differences between the two dichotomized groups were statistically insignificant. In univariate analysis , DFS estimates were 71.0 ± 7.8 months and 18.0 ± 5.9 months in high-SUVmax and low-SUVmax group , respectively ( In NHL patients treated with SCT , the MTV_wb of initial staging F-18 FDG PET/CT was an independent prognostic factor.
