  We report a combination of aryl diselenides/hydrogen peroxide and carbon nanotube-rhodium nanohybrid for naphthols oxidation towards synthesis of 1,4-naphthoquinones and evaluation of their relevant trypanocidal activity. Under a combination of ( PhSe) 2/H2O2 in the presence of O2 in i-PrOH/Hexane , several benzenoid ( A-ring) substituted quinones were prepared in moderate to high yields. We also studied the contribution of RhCNT as co-catalyst in this process and , in some cases , yields were improved. This method provides an efficient and versatile alternative for preparing A-ring modified naphthoquinonoid compounds with relevant biological profile.
