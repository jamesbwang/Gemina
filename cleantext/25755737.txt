  Vaspin ( visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor) was recently identified as a novel adipocytokine with insulin-sensitizing effects. Serum vaspin levels are reported either increased or decreased in patients with coronary artery disease. Our translational research was performed to evaluate the expression of vaspin in human coronary atherosclerotic lesions<symptom> , and its effects on atherogenic responses in human macrophages and human aortic smooth muscle cells ( HASMC) , as well as aortic atherosclerotic lesion<symptom> development in spontaneously hyperlipidemic
