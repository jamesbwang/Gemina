  The therapy with nanocompounds is widely used to treat Fe deficiency and an emerging trend to inhibit tumor growth. The present work aims to address the management of different FeONP , comparing sucrose covered FeONP and Fe nanoparticles in the form of the ferritin with non-particulated inorganic Fe ( II) by enterocytes-like colon cancer cell lines ( Caco-2 and HT-29). Iron uptake results revealed significantly higher Fe incorporation in the case of nanoparticulated Fe , first in the form of FeONP and second in the form of ferritin with respect to inorganic Fe ( II). Furthermore , the intracellular Fe fractionation , conducted by size exclusion chromatography coupled on line to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( SEC-ICP-MS) showed a significant increase of the Fe-ferritin peak upon exposure of cells to the following compounds ferritin > FeONP > FeSO
