  The military has used silver-nylon dressings as a topical antimicrobial on combat-related burns for the past 15 years. However , their clinical efficacy and associated risks have not been evaluated. Herein , the authors document our experience with the use of a specific silver-nylon dressing ( Silverlon ®) during global evacuation of casualties from combat zones to the United States sArmy Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center. A 10-year retrospective analysis was performed. Variables included patient demographics , total body surface area , length of stay , Injury Severity Score , incidence of urinary tract and burn infections , pneumonia<disease> , patient status at the time of discharge , and a composite endpoint. The patient cohort was stratified into two groups: Silverlon ® ( Group 1) and topical antimicrobial agents ( Group 2). Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests ( P ≤ .05). Nine hundred eighty-eight patients ( 26 ± 6 years) were identified with 184 patients ( Group 1) and 804 patients ( Group 2). Silver-nylon dressings trended toward decreased wound<disease> infection<disease> rate ( 5.4 vs 9.5 %) even when applied to full-thickness burn injuries. When compared with topical antimicrobial agents , the silver-nylon dressing was not associated with significant differences in burn-related complication. The authors demonstrate the antimicrobial efficacy of the silver-nylon dressing during global evacuation of burn casualties from combat zones to the burn center. Compared with topical antimicrobials , the silver-nylon dressing is lightweight and easy to apply and requires minimal wound<disease> management which makes it desirable as a burn dressing for combat applications as well as mass casualty situations.
