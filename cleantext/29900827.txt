  We report successful percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL) in an 8-week-old , 4.12 kg infant with a combined stone burden of > 2 cm in a solitary kidney. The patient was born with thoracolumbar myelomeningocele and had developed recurrent urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease>. Her size precluded retrograde intrarenal surgery and shockwave lithotripsy would be unlikely to clear the stone burden. Stone analysis revealed hydroxyapatite and carbonate apatite stones , and metabolic work up revealed hypercalciuria for which chlorothiazide was started. To our knowledge , this is the youngest patient to undergo PCNL reported in the literature.
