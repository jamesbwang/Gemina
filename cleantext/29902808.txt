  Team sports are characterised by frequent episodes of accelerated/decelerated running. The corresponding energy cost can be estimated on the basis of the biomechanical equivalence between accelerated/decelerated running on flat terrain and constant speed running uphill/downhill. This approach allows one to: ( i) estimate the time course of the instantaneous metabolic power requirement of any given player and ( ii) infer therefrom the overall energy expenditure of any given time window of a soccer drill or match. In the original approach , walking and running were aggregated and energetically considered as running , even if in team sports several walking periods are interspersed among running bouts. However , since the transition speed between walking and running is known for any given incline of the terrain , we describe here an approach to identify walking episodes , thus utilising the corresponding energy cost which is smaller than in running. In addition , the new algorithm also takes into account the energy expenditure against the air resistance , for both walking and running. The new approach yields overall energy expenditure values , for a whole match , ≈ 14 % smaller than the original algorithm; moreover , it shows that the energy expenditure against the air resistance is ≈ 2 % of the total.
