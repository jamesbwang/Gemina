  In elderly patients , goal-directed haemodynamic therapy ( GDHT) , depth of anaesthesia monitoring and lung-protective ventilation have been shown to improve postoperative outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate current practices concerning strategies of anaesthesia optimisation in patients aged ≥ 75 years. A multicentre observational study was performed from February to May 2015 in 23 French academic centres. On 30 consecutive days in each centre , patients ≥ 75 years with at least one major comorbidity undergoing elective or emergency procedures ( femoral-neck fractures surgery , intraperitoneal abdominal surgery or vascular surgery) were included. Patient characteristics and data related to GHDT , management of hypotension<symptom> , monitoring of temperature and depth of anaesthesia , lung ventilation , point of care haemoglobin testing were collected. In total , 807 patients were included. Only 2 % of patients ( 95 % CI: 1-3) received GHDT in full accordance with guidelines. Depth of anaesthesia monitoring was largely performed ( 53 % ( 95 % CI: 50-56)). The multifaceted strategy of lung-protective ventilation combining low tidal volumes ( 6-8mL/ kg) , PEEP of 5-8cm cmH In patients ' ≥ 75 years , strategies of anaesthesia optimisation are not in accordance with eligible guidelines. Implementation of these techniques varies independently of factors related to the patient or the type of surgery and may be dependent on the generated constraints.
