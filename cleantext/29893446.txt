  Prior cohorts demonstrating the importance of serum chloride levels in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> either excluded or had partial representation of patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF). We aimed to examine the relationship between serum chloride concentration and outcomes in HFpEF. We included participants from the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> with an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial ( TOPCAT) who met the following criteria: met inclusion by the natriuretic peptide stratum , had recorded serum chloride levels , and were from the Americas ( n = 942). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models tested the association of serum chloride with clinical outcomes , and mixed effects modelling tested the association of spironolactone or loop diuretic on serial serum chloride levels. The median serum chloride level was 102 ( 25th-75th percentile 100-105 mmol/L ( range 84-114 mmol/L)). After multivariable adjustment , every standard deviation decrease in serum chloride ( 4.05 mmol/L) was associated with ∼ 50 % increased risk for cardiovascular death ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.51 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.11-2.06 , P = 0.008) and ∼ 30 % increased risk for all-cause death ( HR 1.29 , 95 % CI 1.02-1.62 , P = 0.04) , but not with the primary composite endpoint or heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalization ( P > 0.3 for both). There were no significant interactions between spironolactone use and the serum chloride-risk relationship ( P > 0.1) for each endpoint. Spironolactone was not ( P = 0.33) but loop diuretic use was associated with lower serial serum chloride levels ( P < 0.001). Lower serum chloride was independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death in HFpEF. Loop diuretic use , but not spironolactone , lead to a decrease in serum chloride levels over time.
