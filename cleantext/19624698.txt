  This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of oral health intervention on the improvement in knowledge and self-reported oral health behavior among 6-8 year old female primary school children in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia. The sample consisted of 1661 girls in primary schools who are 6 to 8-year-olds ( first , second and third graders). The children 's level of knowledge was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire that was formulated for this specific age and divided into two parts; oral health knowledge and self-reported oral health behavior. There were seven multiple choice questions and one true/false question with five underlying parts in the questionnaire which contained basic information about oral health knowledge , oral hygiene practices and certain habits that affect teeth. The questionnaires were distributed before and six weeks after implementation of the oral health educational program to measure the level improvement of knowledge regarding oral health among these children. All the questions showed statistically significant improvement in knowledge and self-reported behavior in the post intervention group. There was a significant increase in the level of knowledge by 11.24 % and level of self-reported behavior by 25 % after intervention ( P < 0.001). The highest net change in the knowledge due to intervention was noted among third graders ( 13.3 %) , whereas for self-reported oral health behavior , it was noted among first graders ( 28.3 %). The results of this study showed that an easy-to-organize and inexpensive school-based intervention can , on a short-term basis , be effective in improving the knowledge and self-reported oral health behavior of children.
