  High-throughput top-down proteomic experiments directly identify proteoforms in complex mixtures , making high quality tandem mass spectra necessary to deeply characterize proteins with many sources of variation. Collision-based dissociation methods offer expedient data acquisition but often fail to extensively fragment proteoforms for thorough analysis. Electron-driven dissociation methods are a popular alternative approach , especially for precursor ions with high charge density. Combining infrared photoactivation concurrent with electron transfer dissociation ( ETD) reactions , i.e. , activated ion ETD ( AI-ETD) , can significantly improve ETD characterization of intact proteins , but benefits of AI-ETD have yet to be quantified in high-throughput top-down proteomics. Here , we report the first application of AI-ETD to LC-MS/MS characterization of intact proteins ( < 20 kDa) , highlighting improved proteoform identification the method offers over higher energy-collisional dissociation ( HCD) , standard ETD , and ETD followed by supplemental HCD activation ( EThcD). We identified 935 proteoforms from 295 proteins from human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 using AI-ETD compared to 1014 proteoforms , 915 proteoforms , and 871 proteoforms with HCD , ETD , and EThcD , respectively. Importantly , AI-ETD outperformed each of the three other methods in MS/MS success rates and spectral quality metrics ( e.g. , sequence coverage achieved and proteoform characterization scores). In all , this four-method analysis offers the most extensive comparisons to date and demonstrates that AI-ETD both increases identifications over other ETD methods and improves proteoform characterization via higher sequence coverage , positioning it as a premier method for high-throughput top-down proteomics.
