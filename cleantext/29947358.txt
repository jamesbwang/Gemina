  To explore associations between quantitative sensory testing ( QST) and pretreatment pain , physical , and psychological characteristics in women with breast cancer. 41 women with treatment-naive stage 0-III breast cancer at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center in Ann Arbor. Participants completed self-report surveys and QST within the month before breast surgery. Pressure pain<symptom> thresholds ( PPTs) were measured bilaterally at each trapezius with a manual QST algometer. PPT values were split , yielding low , moderate , and high pain sensitivity subgroups. Subgroup self-reported characteristics were compared using Spearman 's correlation , chi-square , and one-way analysis of variance. Lower PPT ( higher sensitivity) was associated with higher levels of pain interference and maladaptive pain cognitions. The high-sensitivity group reported higher pain severities , interference , and catastrophizing and lower belief in internal locus of pain control than the low-sensitivity group. Individualized interventions for maladaptive pain cognitions before surgery may reduce pain sensitivity and the severity of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> developed after surgery.
