  The 1-DNJ named 1-deoxynojirimycinis ( 2R ,3 R ,4 R ,5 S) -2- ( hydroxymethyl) piperidine-3,4,5-triol , which is the nature active components existingin mulberryresources including leaves , stems , roots and silkworm larva , silkworm chrysalis , etc.The 1-deoxynojirimycin is a polyhydroxylated piperidine alkaloid , which was first found in Streptomyces as an antibiotic. Then the Japanese researchers isolated it from the mulberry root. 1-DNJ can inhibit postprandial hyperglycemia by suppressing intestinal alpha glucosidase. Therefore , 1-DNJ is often used to treat treating diabetes and complicating disease and to prevent obesity and weight-related disorders. With the development of the researches , 1-deoxynojirimycin and its derivtiv was discovered to possess anti-hyperglycemic , anti-virus , anti-tumor functions and so on. Therefore , based on our current studythe existing knowledge on source , technique preparation process , pharmacokinetics , bioactivties , and in silico target fishing of 1-DNJ were summarized , so that the researchers may use it to explore future perspective of research on 1-DNJ.
