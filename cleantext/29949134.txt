  We aimed to explore the expression level and biological function of lncRNA PRNCR1 in preeclampsia ( PE). 57 PE patients and 57 normal pregnant women were enrolled in this study. The expression level of PRNCR1 in the maternal placenta of PE patients and normal pregnancy was detected by qRT-PCR. The CCK-8 assay was carried out to determine the cell viability after interference and overexpression of PRNCR1 on trophoblasts. We utilized Western blot to examine the protein level of PRNCR1. Higher systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and urinary protein levels in PE patients were observed in comparison with those in normal pregnant women , while the neonatal weight in PE group was markedly lower than that in normal pregnant women. LncRNA PRNCR1 was overexpressed in PE patients , which was positively correlated with systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and urine protein , whereas negatively correlated with fetal birth weight of PE patients. In addition , the expression of PRNCR1 in BeWo trophoblast cells was significantly decreased after the interference with PRNCR1 , while the cell viability increased. However , overexpression of PRNCR1 in HTR-8 cells significantly reduced the viability of cells. Expression levels of p-p38 and p-JNK in PE patients were higher than those in normal pregnancy women , and the expression level of p-ERK was decreased , which suggested that PRNCR1 promoted the progression of PE by modulating the MAPK signaling pathway. PRNCR1 is highly expressed in PE and promotes the progression of PE by modulating the MAPK signaling pathway.
