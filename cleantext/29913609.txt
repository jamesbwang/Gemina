  We examined observation-based fog occurrence at three Czech monitoring sites: Praha 4- Libuš , Košetice and Churáňov , representing different environments- urban , rural and mountain<disease>- over a time span of 27 years ( 1989-2015). We searched for a simple model describing fog occurrence fitting the observed air pollution and meteorological data. For our analysis we used a generalized additive model , GAM , with ( penalized) spline components to capture possible nonlinear and a priori unknown functional relationships. In order to cope with the binary nature of the data ( indicators of fog presence on individual days) , we employed a logistic regression GAM model fitted by a maximizing penalized likelihood ( where the penalty coefficients were estimated via cross-validation). After testing several physically motivated models , being guided by AIC and physical interpretation of the components , we arrived at a model which uses the following explanatory variables: relative humidity , ambient SO The most important explanatory variables modelling the fog probability at three Central European sites were humidity , SO
