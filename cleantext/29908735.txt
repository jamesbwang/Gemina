  Methylmercury ( MeHg) bioaccumulation is a growing concern in ecosystems worldwide. The absorption of solar radiation by dissolved organic matter ( DOM) and other photoreactive ligands can convert MeHg into less toxic forms of mercury through photodemethylation. In this study , spectral changes and photoreactivity of DOM were measured to assess the potential to control photoreactions and predict in situ MeHg concentration. Water samples collected from a series of lakes in southwestern Nova Scotia in June , August , and September were exposed to controlled ultraviolet-A ( UV-A) radiation for up to 24 hr. Dissolved organic matter photoreactivity , measured as the loss of absorbance at 350nm at constant UV-A irradiation , was positively dependent on the initial DOM concentration in lake waters ( r
