  A potential challenge associated with sports is that athletes must often perform the cognitive processing associated with decision-making ( i.e. , movement selection) when fatigued. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarise studies that have analysed the extent to which fatigue<symptom> influences the effects of decision-making on lower extremity mechanics during execution of common sports manoeuvres. We specifically focused on mechanics associated with ACL injury risk. Reviewers searched the PubMed , SPORTDiscus , CINAHL and Web of Science databases. The search identified 183 unique articles. Five of these articles met our eligibility criteria. Two of the studies incorporated fatigue<symptom> protocols where athletes progressed to exhaustion<symptom> and found that the effects of decision-making on mechanics were more pronounced with fatigue<symptom>. The nature of the results appears to indicate that fatigue<symptom> may compromise an athlete 's cognitive processing in a manner that diminishes their ability to control movement when rapid decision-making is required. However , three subsequent studies utilised fatigue<symptom> protocols designed to mimic sports participation and found that fatigue<symptom> did not influence the effects of decision-making on mechanics. In general , these findings appear to indicate that fatigue<symptom> may only affect the cognitive processing associated with decision-making when athletes approach a state of
