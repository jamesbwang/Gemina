  Renal replacement therapy ( RRT) with regional citrate anticoagulation ( RCA) is an important therapeutic approach for refractory hypercalcemia complicated with renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , RCA has the potential to induce arrhythmia caused by rapid calcium loss. We report a case of arrhythmia associated with rapid calcium loss during RCA-RRT. A 51-year-old man with hypercalcemia , primary hyperparathyroidism , and acute kidney injury was treated by predilutional-RCA-hemofiltration at a rate of 4.3 L/h. The effect of lowering serum calcium was unsatisfactory despite reducing calcium substitution gradually from 5.3 to 2.2 mmol/h in the first 8-h session of RCA-hemofiltration. New-onset sinus tachycardia<symptom> with a prolonged QT interval occurred when calcium substitution was infused at rate of 1.1 mmol/h after 15 min of starting the second RCA-hemofiltration session ( estimated net calcium loss was 7.54 mmol/h). When the calcium substitution was increased to usual rate of 5.6 mmol/h , the arrhythmia disappeared after 2 min. Arrhythmia did not recur when the calcium substitution rate was 2.2 mmol/h during the third session ( estimated net calcium loss was 6.44 mmol/L). After the third RCA-hemofiltration session , the patient underwent parathyroidectomy and serum calcium returned to normal. This case indicated that rapid calcium loss may cause arrhythmia in RCA-hemofiltration , and the rate of net calcium loss should be limited below a threshold value to prevent similar adverse effect during RCA-RRT.
