  The objective of this study was to investigate the extent to which neuropsychological performance parameters implicated in ADHD might mediate the relationship between emotional lability ( EL) and this disorder. Eight hundred twelve adult patients with ADHD were examined. EL was assessed using the EL subscale of Conners ' Adult ADHD Rating Scales ( CAARS). To assess cognitive and executive functions , a battery of neuropsychological tests was performed in 262 patients with ADHD and high EL symptomatology and 550 patients with ADHD and low EL symptomatology. Several differences between groups were found regarding neuropsychological performance; however , nearly all significant differences disappeared when the effect of gender , inattention , and hyperactive symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities were taken into account. Our results do not support the hypothesis that neuropsychological deficits are associated with EL in adults with ADHD.
