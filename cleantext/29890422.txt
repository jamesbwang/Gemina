  Aerobic granular sludge is a form of microbial auto-aggregation , and a promising biotechnology for wastewater treatment. This review aims at providing the first comprehensive , systematic , and in-depth overview on the application of aerobic granules as biosorbents. The target pollutants encompass heavy metals ( both cationic and oxyanionic) , nuclides , dyes , and inorganic non-metal substances. Different granule types are discussed , i.e. intact and fragmented , compact and fluffy , original and modified , and the effects of granule surface modification are introduced. A detailed comparison is conducted on the characteristics of granular biomass , the conditions of the adsorption tests , and the resultant performance towards various sorbates. Analytical and mathematical tools typically employed are presented , and possible interactions between the pollutants and granules are theorized , leading to an analysis on the mechanisms of the adsorption processes. Original granules appear highly effective towards cationic metals , while surface modification by organic and inorganic agents can expand their applicability to other pollutants. Combined with their advantages of high mechanical strength , density , and settling speed , aerobic granules possess exceptional potential in real wastewater treatment as biosorbents. Possible future research , both fundamental and practical , is suggested to gain more insights into the mechanism of their function , and to advance their industrial application.
