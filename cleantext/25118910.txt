  Failure to timely diagnose HIV<pathogen> in infants is a major barrier for scaling-up paediatric antiretroviral treatment ( ART). WHO recommends birth testing for earlier diagnosis and to improve test coverage , but current diagnosis takes 2-3 weeks to complete , thereby limiting the ability of care givers to provide follow-on care , especially in low-resource settings. We evaluated the benefit of implementing rapid diagnosis of HIV<pathogen> at birth in primary health care maternity wards in Mozambique. Infants born to HIV-infected mothers delivering consecutively at eight primary health care clinics were tested within 24 hours of delivery using on-site POC ( Alere q HIV1/2 Detect) and standard laboratory ( Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/TaqMan HIV-1 qualitative assay v2 .0) testing. Infants were also tested at 4-6 weeks of age with both assays. Of 2,350 HIV-exposed infants enrolled in this implementation research study , 33 tested HIV-positive at birth on both assays. Sensitivity and specificity of POC testing compared with laboratory testing at birth were 100 % ( 95 % CI 89 · 4-100 · 0) and 100 % ( 95 % CI 99 · 8-100 · 0) , respectively. At 4-6 weeks of age , 61 infants were identified as HIV-positive; of these 29 ( 47 · 5 %) had a positive test at birth. Testing at both birth and 4-6 weeks identified 71 HIV-positive infants compared with 61 infants by testing at 4-6 weeks alone , a 16 % increase. Two infants tested positive at birth but tested HIV-negative during follow-up. Adding POC birth testing to the 4-6 week screen may increase access to HIV<pathogen> diagnosis and expedite ART initiation in primary health care settings within low resource settings. Guidance on appropriate confirmatory HIV<pathogen> testing algorithms for birth testing is needed.
