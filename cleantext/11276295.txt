  The consumption of energy drinks ( ED) and ginseng by young people to enhance their mental and physical performance has become widespread. Reported side-effects of ED have raised doubts regarding their safety. This cross-sectional study investigates the phenomenon. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to a representative sample of Verona university students. The resulting data were analyzed with Excel 2013 , STATA 13 software. ED and ginseng consumption was reported by 38.6 % and 37.4 % of the students , respectively. More than 70 % of ED and ginseng users were 18 to 22 years old. Excluding non-responders , ED consumers were mostly males ( 51.8 % vs 33.0 %) , contrary to ginseng consumers ( females 40.4 % vs 30.9 %). Being a working student was significantly positively associated both to EDs ( OR 1.5) and ginseng use ( OR 1.4). The most frequently reported academic and other reasons for ED use were: `` to study longer '' ( 47.5 %) , and `` to socialize '' ( 29.1 %). The most often used combinations were ED containing alcohol ( 65.6 %) and ginseng-coffee beverages ( 71.8 %). The diffusion of ED and ginseng consumption warrants prevention and monitoring measures , and deserves further analysis.
