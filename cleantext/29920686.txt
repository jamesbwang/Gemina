  Abscisic acid ( ABA) plays a multifaceted role in plant immunity and can either increase resistance or increase susceptibility to some bacterial and fungal pathogens depending on the pathosystem. ABA is also known to mediate plant defence to some viruses. In this study , the relationship between the ABA pathway and rice black-streaked dwarf virus ( RBSDV) was investigated in rice. The expression of ABA pathway genes was significantly reduced upon RBSDV infection. Application of exogenous hormones and various ABA pathway mutants revealed that the ABA pathway plays a negative role in rice defence against RBSDV. Exogenous hormone treatment and virus inoculation showed that ABA inhibits the jasmonate-mediated resistance to RBSDV. ABA treatment also suppressed accumulation of reactive oxygen species by inducing the expression of superoxidase dismutases and catalases. Thus , ABA modulates the rice-RBSDV interaction by suppressing the jasmonate pathway and regulating reactive oxygen species levels. This is the first example of ABA increasing susceptibility to a plant virus.
