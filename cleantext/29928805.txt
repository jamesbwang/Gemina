  In the past 10 years , many studies on superhydrophobic ( SH) papers have been reported. However , these works are rarely carried out on Chinese paintings. Compared with pure paper , the complexity of Chinese black ink and pigment , caused by including animal glue and fixatives allowing the nanoparticles to disperse in water , negatively affects the formation of SH coatings. In this work , we report the fabrication of SH coatings using fluorine silicon sol containing an epoxy group on Chinese paintings. Briefly , SiO
