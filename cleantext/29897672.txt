  The ability of mechanochemistry to alter established chemical selectivity is demonstrated. A copper ( I)- catalyzed mechanochemical aldehyde/alkyne/amine coupling using calcium carbide as the acetylene source provides selective access to 1,4-diamino-2-butynes , which contrasts classical approaches that provide propargylamine-type products. Solventless milling conditions were found to be essential to unmask A
