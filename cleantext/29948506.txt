  Aryl hydrocarbon-receptor nuclear translocator ( ARNT2) is a member of the bHLH PAS ( basic helix-loop-helix Period/ARNT/Single-minded) family of transcription factors. Recently , some studies indicate that ARNT2 is associated with the occurrence and development of carcinoma. However , its roles in gastric cancer ( GC) remain unclear. In the present study , we found that ARNT2 expression level is lower in GC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues , and negatively correlated with depth of invasion of the tumor , differentiated degree , and poor survival of GC patients. Overexpression of ARNT2 inhibits cell proliferation. Furthermore , AKT pathway contributed to ARNT2- mediated PC proliferation. Taken together , our results provide the first evidence that high expression of ARNT2 inhibited proliferation of GC cells and affected tumor aggressiveness in GC patients.
