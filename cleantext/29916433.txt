  Since 201 4 , there is a shift in terror targets , with a 1 72 % increase in the deaths of common citizens. India ranks fourth in the global terrorism index. Intelligence , security and counter-terrorism conjointly form the contours of priority for governance and public engagement but the attendant aspects of health system remain neglected. Recurring acts of global terrorism have given rise to unique medical requirements that can be termed as ` terror medicine ' , geared towards managing health impacts of terrorism and not just a single patient. Health impacts of terrorism that affect vulnerable and non-combative citizens will need a well-developed healthcare delivery mechanism consisting of four components: medical preparedness , incident management , care of injuries and body functions , and intervention for psychological consequences. Terror medicine should not be considered a ` dangerous territory ' , as it can provide opportunities for healthcare to gain new strengths of knowledge and research , similar to the medical outcomes from the two world wars.
