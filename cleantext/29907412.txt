  This study describes the use of a magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotube composite for the preconcentration of nine parabens ( methyl , ethyl , propyl , isopropyl , butyl , isobutyl , pentyl , phenyl and benzylparaben) from water and urine samples after in situ acetylation. The enriched extracts were obtained by dispersive magnetic solid phase extraction ( DMSPE) and analysed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry ( GC-MS). Several parameters affecting the adsorption ( extraction time , magnetic material mass and ionic strength) and desorption ( desorption solvent nature and volume , and desorption time) DMSPE steps were investigated. Matrix-matched calibration was recommended for quantification of the samples. Linearities in the 0.5-150 ng mL
