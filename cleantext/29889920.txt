  The objectives of this study were to determine the quantitative changes after different ridge preservation techniques ( primary aim) and to assess the possibility of placing a dental implant , the bone quality , and the need for bone augmentation ( secondary aim). A total of 35 patients who required extraction of at least one tooth ( incisor , canine , or premolar) provided 35 single-gap extraction sites. After minimally invasive tooth removal , the sockets were randomly scheduled for one of four treatment modalities: placement of a deproteinized bovine bone mineral ( DBBM; Endobon , Biomet 3i) covered with a soft tissue punch from the palate ( T1); placement of DBBM alone ( T2); placement of DBBM covered with a resorbable collagen membrane ( OsseoGuard , Biomet 3i) ( T3); or no additional treatment ( T4). Silicone impressions were taken before and 6 months after extraction for quantitative-volumetric evaluation ( primary outcome). The possibility of placing an implant , bone quality , and need for further bone augmentation were also noted ( secondary outcomes). During the study period , no adverse events were observed. No statistically significant difference was found between the four treatments regarding the primary and secondary outcome parameters ( P > .05). However , T4 showed double the buccal contour change , with the highest variance compared to the other three groups ( T1 -0.874 ± 0.713; T2 -0.968 ± 0.344; T3 -1.26 ± 0.942; T4 -2.15 ± 1.349). Although no statistically significant difference was found between the four treatment modalities , placement of DBBM resulted in only half the contour change ( < 1 mm) compared to control sites ( > 2 mm). Ridge preservation with a DBBM with or without soft tissue punch should be considered in esthetically demanding cases and delayed or late implant placement.
