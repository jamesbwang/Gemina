  Based on previous work , the influence of the chain composition on the physical-chemical properties of five new transfection lipids ( TH10 , TT10 , OH10 , OT10 and OO10) containing the same lysine-based head group has been investigated in aqueous dispersions. For this purpose , the chain composition has been gradually varied from saturated tetradecyl ( T , C14: 0) and hexadecyl ( H , C16: 0) chains to longer but unsaturated oleyl ( O , C18: 1) chains with double bonds in the cis configuration. In this work , the lipid dispersions have been investigated in the absence and presence of the helper lipid DOPE and calf thymus DNA by small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS/WAXS) supplemented by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) , attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( ATR-FTIR) and Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy ( FTRS). Lamellar and inverted hexagonal mesophases have been observed in single-component systems. In the binary mixtures , the aggregation behaviour changes with an increasing amount of DOPE from lamellar to cubic. The lipid mixtures with DNA show a panoply of mesophases. Interestingly , TT10 and OT10 form cubic lipoplexes , whereas OO10 complexes the DNA sandwich-like between lipid bilayers in a lamellar lipoplex. Surprisingly , the latter is the most effective lipoplex.
