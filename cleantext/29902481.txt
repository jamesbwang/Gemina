  Neurodegenerative diseases ( ND) are among the leading causes of disability and mortality. Considerable sex differences exist in the occurrence of the various manifestations leading to cognitive decline. Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) exhibits substantial sexual dimorphisms and disproportionately affects women. Women have a higher life expectancy compared to men and , consequently , have more lifespan to develop AD. The emerging precision medicine and pharmacology concepts- taking into account the individual genetic and biological variability relevant for disease risk , prevention , detection , diagnosis , and treatment- are expected to substantially enhance our knowledge and management of AD. Stratifying the affected individuals by sex and gender is an important basic step towards personalization of scientific research , drug development , and care. We hypothesize that sex and gender differences , extending from genetic to psychosocial domains , are highly relevant for the understanding of AD pathophysiology , and for the conceptualization of basic/translational research and for clinical therapy trial design.
