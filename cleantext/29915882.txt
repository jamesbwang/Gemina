  Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) making up most of these cases. Males have poorer overall survival compared to women following a lung cancer diagnosis. Many studies have focused on the effects of estrogen to explain higher survival rates among women , but few have looked at the effects of androgens. We describe the expression of the androgen receptor ( AR) and Ki67 in lung cancer specimens in the Manitoba Tumor Bank ( MTB) and correlate these factors with patient outcome. Using the MTB , we performed immunohistochemistry on lung cancer tissue to determine expression of the AR and Ki67. These were then correlated with patient outcome. Of the 136 cases , 55 % were female and 55 % were adenocarcinoma. AR expression was not independently associated with outcome. Ki67 was associated with a significantly higher hazard ratio for death and recurrence ( HR 2.19 , 95 % CI 1.30-3.70; HR 1.92 , 95 % CI 1.07-3.46 , respectively). AR expression modified the effect of Ki67 on outcome , such that when both were expressed , there was no association with recurrence or survival ( HR 2.39 , 95 % CI 1.31-4.36 for AR- Ki67 + vs HR 1.54 , 95 % CI 0.44-5.37 for AR + Ki67 +). Ki67 was associated with poorer outcomes alone. AR status alone was not associated with outcome. Although the mechanism remains unclear , AR status seems to negate the association of a high Ki67 and poor outcome.
