  Transcription factor ( TF)- mediated reprogramming to pluripotency is a slow and inefficient process , because most pluripotency TFs fail to access relevant target sites in a refractory chromatin environment. It is still unclear how TFs actually orchestrate the opening of repressive chromatin during the long latency period of reprogramming. Here , we show that the orphan nuclear receptor Esrrb plays a pioneering role in recruiting the core pluripotency factors Oct4 , Sox2 , and Nanog to inactive enhancers in closed chromatin during the reprogramming of epiblast stem cells. Esrrb binds to silenced enhancers containing stable nucleosomes and hypermethylated DNA , which are inaccessible to the core factors. Esrrb binding is accompanied by local loss of DNA methylation , LIF-dependent engagement of p300 , and nucleosome displacement , leading to the recruitment of core factors within approximately 2 days. These results suggest that TFs can drive rapid remodeling of the local chromatin structure , highlighting the remarkable plasticity of stable epigenetic information.
