  This study aims to evaluate the prognostic role of the decrease in total lesion<symptom> glycolysis ( TLG) assessed by fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG) PET-computed tomography ( CT) 1 month after yttrium-90-radioembolization ( Y-RE) in patients affected by hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) with portal vein tumour thrombosis ( PVTT). Twenty-one patients with histologically proven poorly differentiated HCC and evidence of PVTT at the enhanced multislice CT underwent Y-RE. All patients underwent an F-FDG PET-CT scan at baseline and 1 month after the loco-regional therapy. The variation in TLG ( ΔTLG) between the two studies was calculated. Patients were divided in two groups ( group 1: 1 month ΔTLG > 50 % , group 2: ΔTLG < 50 %). Statistical analysis was carried out to assess the prognostic role of TLG in overall survival ( OS). On the 21 patients enrolled , all presented a decrease in TLG after the administration of Y-microspheres. The OS was 11.5 ± 1.2 months. Nine out of 21 ( 42.9 %) patients showed ΔTLG more than 50 % with a mean OS of 16.8 ± 1.3 months , whereas the remaining 12 ( 57.1 %) patients had ΔTLG less than 50 % with a mean OS of 7.5 ± 0.5 months. Statistical analysis showed ΔTLG to be a significant ( P < 0.001) predictor of survival. None of the other examined variables including age , Child-Pugh classification , previously performed therapies , the presence of extrahepatic metastases , α-fetoprotein and bilirubin levels had a significant prognostic impact on patients ' outcome. Decrease in TLG measured by F-FDG PET-CT is correlated with a trend towards a longer median survival in patients affected by HCC and PVTT who have undergone Y-RE.
