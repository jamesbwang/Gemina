  We aimed to analyze the clinical and histological effects of chemotherapy in superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( SESCC). We analyzed tumor samples from five patients with cT1bN1M0 who underwent subtotal esophagectomy following two courses of a new triplet chemotherapy regimen including docetaxel , cisplatin , and 5-fluorouracil ( DCF). To assess the histological effects of chemotherapy , resected specimens were analyzed by macroscopic examination , hematoxylin & eosin ( HE) staining , immunohistochemical ( IHC) staining ( p53 , Ki-67 and cytokeratin) and periodic acid-Schiff ( PAS) staining. All five patients had a pathological T stage of T0/1a-LPM/1a-MM/ 1b ( 1/2/1/ 1) and histological grade of grade1a/1b/2/ 3 ( 1/1/2/ 1). Endoscopic examination revealed substantial shrinkage of lugol-voiding lesions<symptom> ( LVLs) in all cases. One case showed complete LVL disappearance , and resected specimen examination confirmed pathological complete response ( pCR). IHC and PAS staining revealed that most initial LVLs were PAS-negative. Obvious viable cells were confirmed in two cases. The other three cases exhibited nuclear atypia and strong expression of p53 and Ki-67 in the basal layer of mucosa or lamina propria mucosae<symptom> , even though the superficial layer of mucosa showed no obvious LVLs with PAS-positive. p53-positive lesions<symptom> were also observed in Ki-67-positive. This indicated discordance between the endoscopic findings and histopathological evaluation. DCF chemotherapy alone had a substantial therapeutic effect on SESCC in all cases. However , despite the normal appearance of the mucosal surface , viable cancer cells remained below the basal layer of mucosa. Careful attention should be paid when diagnosing clinical CR , or securing a resection margin of SESCC after DCF chemotherapy.
