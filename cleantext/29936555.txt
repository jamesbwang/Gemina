  Cognitive impairment and dementia are major neurocognitive disorders that cause a noticeable decline in cognitive abilities , including memory and thinking skills. The effectiveness of using folic acid as an adjuvant for management of neurocognitive disorders is not well-known. This paper explains the role of folic acid , including its usefulness , effectiveness , adverse side effects , and active mechanisms on cognitive functions of the elderly. In the current study , we reviewed clinical and experimental studies investigating the use of folic acid prior to November 2017 , using PubMed , ISI Web of Knowledge , Science Direct , Scopus , Ovid , and Cochrane Library databases. A total of 142 articles were retrieved by electronic search. Based on the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria , a total of 36 articles were retrieved for full text analysis. According to data obtained from the review , it seems that folic acid supplementation may improve cognitive function by decreasing homocysteine ( Hcy) , vascular care , attenuating inflammatory status , modification of cerebral folic acid deficiency , and antioxidant responses. Specifically , people with high levels of Hcy have a better response to folic acid supplementation , which may arise from low serum folate concentration.
