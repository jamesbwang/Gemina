  Admission lactate and lactate clearance are implemented for risk stratification in sepsis<disease> and trauma. In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , results regarding outcome and lactate are conflicting. This is a post-hoc analysis of the Target Temperature Management trial in which 950 unconscious patents after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized to a temperature intervention of 33 °C or 36 °C. Serial lactate samples during the first 36 hours were collected. Admission lactate , 12-hour lactate , and the clearance of lactate within 12 hours after admission were analyzed and the association with 30-day mortality assessed. Samples from 877 patients were analyzed. In univariate logistic regression analysis , the odds ratio for death by day 30 for each mmol/L was 1.12 ( 1.08-1.16) for admission lactate , P < .01 , 1.21 ( 1.12-1.31) for 12-hour lactate , P < .01 , and 1.003 ( 1.00-1.01) for each percentage point increase in 12-hour lactate clearance , P = .03. Only admission lactate and 12-hour lactate levels remained significant after adjusting for known predictors of outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.65 ( 0.61-0.69) , P < .001 , 0.61 ( 0.57-0.65) , P < .001 , and 0.53 ( 0.49-0.57) , P = .15 for admission lactate , 12-hour lactate , and 12-hour lactate clearance , respectively. Admission lactate and 12-hour lactate values were independently associated with 30-day mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while 12-hour lactate clearance was not. The clinical value of lactate as the sole predictor of outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is , however , limited.
