  The objective of this study was to identify potential epigenetic mediating pathways linking early life social disadvantage ( ELSD) to adulthood BMI. Sex-specific epigenome-wide two-stage mediation analyses were conducted in blood and adipose tissue , and mediation estimates were obtained using cross-product mediation analysis. Pathway analyses were conducted using GREAT software ( Bejerano Lab , CA , USA). Candidate mediation CpG sites were identified in adipose tissue , but not blood , and were sex-specific. Significant mediation sites in females included CpG loci in genes: PKHG1 , BCAR3 , ADAM5P , PIEZO1 , FGFRL1 , FASN and DPP9 , among others. Pathway analyses revealed evidence of enrichment for processes associated with TFG-Î² signaling and immunologic signatures. In males , significant mediation loci included sites in MAP3K5 and RPTOR , which have previously been associated with adipogenesis , inflammation<symptom> and insulin resistance. Our findings provide supportive evidence for the mediating role of epigenetic mechanisms in the effect of early life social disadvantage on adulthood BMI.
