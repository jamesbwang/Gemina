  Antidepressants are one of the most prescribed classes of medications. A number of case reports have linked these drugs to extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPSs) , but no large epidemiologic study to date has examined this association. We sought to quantify the association of EPSs with different antidepressants by undertaking a large pharmacoepidemiologic study. A nested case-control study was conducted using a large health claims database in the United States from June 2006 to December 2015. Subjects with a diagnosis of primary Parkinson disease and those who received prescriptions of levodopa , ropinirole , pramipexole , domperidone , metoclopramide , entacapone , benztropine , selegiline , rasagiline , diphenhydramine , trihexyphenidyl , typical and atypical antipsychotics , and tricyclic antidepressants were excluded. Cases were followed to the first billing code for an extrapyramidal event or last date of enrollment in the cohort. For each case , 10 control subjects were matched by follow-up time , calendar time , and age through density-based sampling. Rate ratios were computed using conditional logistic regression adjusting for other covariates. We identified 3,838 subjects with EPSs compared with 38,380 age-matched control subjects. Rate ratios with respect to EPSs were as follows: duloxetine , 5.68 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 4.29-7.53); mirtazapine , 3.78 ( 95 % CI , 1.71-8.32); citalopram , 3.47 ( 95 % CI , 2.68-4.50); escitalopram , 3.23 ( 95 % CI , 2.44-4.26); paroxetine , 3.07 ( 95 % CI , 2.15-4.40); sertraline , 2.57 ( 95 % CI , 2.02-3.28); venlafaxine , 2.37 ( 95 % CI , 1.71-3.29); bupropion , 2.31 ( 95 % CI , 1.67-3.21); and fluoxetine , 2.03 ( 95 % CI , 1.48-2.78). This observational study demonstrates a harmful association between the incidence of Parkinson disease or associated EPSs and use of the antidepressants duloxetine , mirtazapine , citalopram , escitalopram , paroxetine , sertraline , venlafaxine , bupropion , and fluoxetine.
