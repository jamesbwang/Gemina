  Ewing sarcoma<disease> is a small round cell tumor that affects bone and soft tissues. Although the detection of the specific fusion gene is a robust method of its diagnosis , immunohistochemistry may serve as a practical surrogate. Recent tissue microarray studies suggested that PAX7 is a novel marker , because it was consistently expressed in Ewing sarcoma<disease> , in addition to rhabdomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma<disease>. Here , we evaluated the utility of PAX7 immunohistochemistry in whole-tissue sections of an expanded array of round cell malignancies with adequate molecular characterization. We stained 30 molecularly confirmed Ewing sarcomas<disease> , one EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcoma<disease> , and 141 non-Ewing round cell tumors by a monoclonal antibody against PAX7. Staining was considered positive if at least 5 % of tumor cells were stained. PAX7 was expressed in 27 of 30 Ewing sarcomas<disease> ( 90 %) , mostly in a diffuse and strong manner. Although NKX2-2 showed similar sensitivity , PAX7 showed more extensive and strong reactivity. One EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcoma<disease> co-expressed PAX7 and NKX2-2. PAX7 was also expressed in 24 of 141 non-Ewing tumors , including alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas ( 7/10) , poorly-differentiated synovial sarcomas<disease> ( 7/10) , BCOR-CCNB3 sarcomas<disease> ( 8/10) , small cell osteosarcoma ( 1/5) , and desmoplastic small round cell tumor ( 1/10) , one third of which showed diffuse strong reactivity. Although we confirmed that PAX7 is a sensitive marker for Ewing sarcoma<disease> , anti-PAX7 antibody also stained several Ewing sarcoma<disease> mimics , whose spectrum was distinct from NKX2-2-positive non-Ewing entities. Further studies are required to determine how PAX7 could be integrated into practice to efficiently classify small round cell tumors. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
