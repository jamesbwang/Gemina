  To evaluate the influence of cataract surgery on meibomian gland dysfunction , in particular on postoperative functional symptoms. Thirty patients who underwent cataract surgery were included in the study. A clinical examination ( OSDI questionnaire , measurement of tear break up time ( TBUT) , corneal staining , meibomian gland expressibility test) and a paraclinical evaluation ( loss of Meibomius glands ( LMG) measured using ImageJ on meibography , conjunctival redness and non-invasive tear break up time ( NIK-BUT)) were performed preoperatively and at 1 month and 3 months after phacoemulsification. TBUT and meibomian gland expressibility were worsened at 1 month and 3 months postoperatively ( P < 0.05). LMG was significantly more important for the upper eyelid and the mean at 1 month ( 33.1 ± 15.2 P = 0.02; 28.5 ± 15.6 P = 0.025 , respectively) and 3 months postoperatively ( 36.5 ± 17.4 P = 0.0005; 31.2 ± 17.4 P = 0.0002 , respectively) than preoperative values ( 29.4 ± 15.3; 26 ± 15 , respectively). There was a significant correlation between LMG on the upper eyelid preoperatively and the OSDI score at 1 month postoperatively ( R = 0.37; P = 0.05). The meibomian gland<symptom> loss<symptom> in the upper eyelid is associated with an increased postoperative ocular discomfort score. Alterations in the meibomian gland expressibility and TBUT persist for up to 3 months postoperatively suggesting a direct role of cataract surgery by an obstructive mechanism.
