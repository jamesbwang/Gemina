  Altering climatic conditions and water stress drastically affects the chilli crop yield. In this scenario we adapted a strategic approach for screening of elite chilli genotypes , by exploring role of seed antioxidants in stress tolerance during vegetative phase. A total of 20 chilli genotypes ' seed antioxidant potential and its effect on water stress tolerance were studied at three water regimes , namely , control ( 100 % Field Capacity) , moderate ( 80 % Field Capacity) , and severe ( 60 % Field Capacity) stress conditions. Drought tolerance traits relative water content , chlorophyll content , and activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes were measured. A strong correlation was observed between seed antioxidants and water stress tolerant traits in seedlings. Genotypes KCa-5 , KCa-6 , and KCa-10 showed low quantity of H
