  Flavokawain B ( FKB) , a natural kava chalcone , shows potent antitumor activity in various types of cancer , although the mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study , we report that FKB has profound effects on the metabolic state of human thyroid cancer ( TCa) cells , leading to high autophagy flux through upregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase , which in turn inhibits mTOR and activates Beclin-1 in TCa cells. We further report that the autophagy induced by FKB plays a prosurvival role in TCa cells both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion , our findings provide evidence that combination treatment with FKB and pharmacological autophagy inhibitors will be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of TCa.
