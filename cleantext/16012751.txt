  Osteoarthritis ( OA) is a complex degenerative joint disorder , which is caused by both environmental and genetic factors. Previous studies have indicated that the GNL3 gene is associated with knee osteoarthritis ( KOA) susceptibility in Europeans; however , the exact molecular mechanism is still unclear. In the present study , we investigated the potential genetic association of GNL3 with KOA in a two-stage sample of 6,704 individuals from the Han Chinese population. Subjects containing 1,052 KOA patients and 2,117 controls were considered the discovery dataset , while subjects consisting of 1,173 KOA patients and 2,362 controls were utilized as the replication dataset. Single-SNP association , imputation , and haplotypic association analyses were performed. The SNP of rs11177 in GNL3 was identified to be significantly associated with KOA after accounting for age , gender and BMI in both stages. The imputed SNP of rs6617 in SPCS1 was found to be strongly associated with KOA risk , and the significant association signal was confirmed in the replication stage. Moreover , a haplotype-based analysis also indicated a positive genetic effect of GNL3 on KOA susceptibility. In summary , our results proved that GNL3 plays an important role in the etiology of KOA , suggesting that GNL3 is a potential genetic modifier for KOA development.
