  A model of K-Ras-initiated lung cancer was used to follow the transition of precancerous adenoma to adenocarcinoma. In hypoxic , Tgf-β1-rich interiors of adenomas , we show that adenoma cells divide asymmetrically to produce cancer-generating cells highlighted by epithelial mesenchymal transition and a CD44/Zeb1 loop. In these cells , Zeb1 represses the Smad inhibitor Zeb2/Sip1 , causing Pten loss and launching Tgf-β1 signaling that drives nuclear translocation of Yap1. Surprisingly , the nuclear polarization of transcription factors during mitosis establishes parent and daughter fates prior to cytokinesis in sequential asymmetric divisions that generate cancer cells from precancerous lesions<symptom>. Mutation or knockdown of Zeb1 in the lung blocked the production of CD44
