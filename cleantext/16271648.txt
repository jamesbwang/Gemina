  Guillain-Barre syndrome<disease> ( GBS) is an immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy. We compared clinical , laboratory characteristics , and disease course of GBS subtypes in a large group of Iranian patients in Isfahan. We collected data from patients who were admitted to Alzahra referral university Hospital , Isfahan , Iran with a diagnosis of GBS. In this population-based cross-sectional research , characteristic of 388 cases with GBS between 2010 and 2015 were studied. The current study recruited 388 patients with GBS including 241 males ( 62.1 %) and 147 females ( 37.9 %) with a mean age of 42.78 ± 21.34. Patients with polyradiculopathy had the highest mean age of 55.12 ± 20.59 years , whereas the least age was seen in acute motor axonal neuropathy ( AMAN) with the mean of 36.30 ± 18.71 years. The frequency of GBS witnessed the highest frequency in spring with 113 cases ( 29.1 %) and winter with 101 cases ( 26 %). Patients ' electrodiagnostic findings indicated that the highest frequency pertained to AMSAN with 93 cases ( 24 %) , whereas the least frequent diagnosis was acute Polyradiculopathy with 8 cases ( 2.1 %). Most of the patients did not have any infections ( 53.6 %) and among patients with infections , AMSAN had the highest frequency ( 22.9 %) and finally , patients with AMSAN and AMAN had a higher length of stay. The study demonstrated incidence , sex distribution , preceding infection , and surgery similar to previous studies. However , our data differs from a study in Tehran that showed acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy is more prevalent than other types and we found a seasonal preponderance in cold months , particularly in axonal types.
