  A novel bench-scale stirred bioreactor for solid-state fermentation was used to determine the effect of the stirring rate on growth and enzymes production by Trichoderma<pathogen> harzianum PBLA. Lab-scale static tubular bioreactors were first used to assess the effect of bioreactor diameter on heat accumulation , growth , and production of cellulases and xylanases. The increased diameters ( 1.8-4.2 cm) led to increases in temperature up to 36 °C ( at a rate of 1.08 °C/ cm) , which negatively affected the growth and enzyme production. Afterward , in the bench-scale bioreactor operated at rates up to 3.0 rpm , maximum xylanases production ( 107 ± 0.3 U/g dm) was attained at rates of 0.5 and 1.0 rpm , reaching a maximum of 34 ± 0.3 °C. Cellulases production was reduced ( up to 79 %) due to stirring. Therefore , the production of xylanases by T. harzianum can be performed in this cross-flow stirred SSF bioreactor at rates up to 1.0 rpm , avoiding heat accumulation and damage on metabolic activity.
