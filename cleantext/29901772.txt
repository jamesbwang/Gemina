  SOX9 is known as a crucial transcription factor for various developmental processes and for tissue homeostasis. We examined here its potential role in alternative splicing by analyzing global splicing changes , using RNA-seq of colon tumor cells. We show that SOX9 knockdown alters the splicing of hundreds of genes without affecting their expression levels , revealing that SOX9 controls distinct splicing and transcriptional programs. SOX9 does not affect splicing patterns through the control of splicing factors expression. We identify mutants that uncouple SOX9 splicing function from its transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that SOX9 binds to RNA and associates with several RNA-binding proteins , including the core exon junction complex component Y14. Half of SOX9 splicing targets are also modulated by Y14 and are no longer regulated by SOX9 upon Y14 depletion. Altogether , our work reveals that SOX9 is a moonlighting protein which modulates either transcription or splicing of distinct sets of targets.
