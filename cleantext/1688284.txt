  The question of whether mossy fiber sprouting is epileptogenic has not been resolved; both sprouting-induced recurrent excitatory and inhibitory circuit hypotheses have been experimentally ( but not fully) supported. Therefore , whether mossy fiber sprouting is a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy remains under debate. Moreover , the axon guidance mechanisms of mossy fiber sprouting have attracted the interest of neuroscientists. Sprouting of mossy fibers exhibits several uncommon axonal growth features in the basically non-plastic adult brain. For example , robust branching of axonal collaterals arises from pre-existing primary mossy fiber axons. Understanding the branching mechanisms in adulthood may contribute to axonal regeneration therapies in neuroregenerative medicine in which robust axonal re-growth is essential. Additionally , because granule cells are produced throughout life in the neurogenic dentate gyrus , it is interesting to examine whether the mossy fibers of newly generated granule cells follow the pre-existing trajectories of sprouted mossy fibers in the epileptic brain. Understanding these axon guidance mechanisms may contribute to neuron transplantation therapies , for which the incorporation of transplanted neurons into pre-existing neural circuits is essential. Thus , clarifying the axon guidance mechanisms of mossy fiber sprouting could lead to an understanding of central nervous system ( CNS) network reorganization and plasticity. Here , we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon guidance in mossy fiber sprouting by discussing mainly
