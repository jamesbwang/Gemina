  Preterm birth is the leading cause of death worldwide in children < 5 years of age; however , technology and advances in medical knowledge are increasing the survival of children born even at the fringes of viability. With increased survival comes increased risk of long-term neurologic impairments. This paper aims to review recent findings related to changes in brain development associated with prematurity and its impact on neurodevelopmental disabilities. Advanced imaging techniques , longitudinal follow-up of individuals born extremely preterm into adulthood and improved understanding of risk factors associated with neurologic impairment contribute to recent discoveries. Sensory impairments are often associated with later cognitive and social impairments and therefore represent targets for therapy. All aspects of neurologic development can be affected by preterm delivery. Future research is needed to further elucidate targets for prenatal and postnatal interventions for neuroprotection and to improve outcomes of prematurity.
