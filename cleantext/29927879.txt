  To determine the relationship between theophylline trough levels and urine output in critically ill children administered aminophylline as adjunctive diuretic therapy. Retrospective cohort study. The PICU of a tertiary care children 's hospital. A mixed population of medical/surgical including postoperative cardiothoracic surgery patients less than 18 years old. Electronic medical records of all PICU patients admitted from July 2010 to June 2015 were reviewed , and patients who received aminophylline as diuretic therapy were identified. Patient cohort data including demographics , daily aminophylline , furosemide and chlorothiazide dosing , theophylline trough levels , fluid intake , urine output and total fluid balance<symptom> , blood urea nitrogen , and creatinine levels were abstracted. Multivariate analysis based on a generalized estimating equations approach demonstrated that aminophylline administration , when analyzed as a categorical variable , was associated with an increase in urine output and decreased fluid balance<symptom>. However , aminophylline dosing , when analyzed as a continuous variable , was associated with neither an increase in urine output nor decreased fluid balance<symptom>. Theophylline trough levels were not correlated with urine output at 24 hours ( p = 0.78) and were negatively correlated with urine output at 48 hours ( r = 0.078; p < 0.005). Aminophylline administration provided a measure of increased diuresis , regardless of dosage , and theophylline trough levels. Therefore , achieving a prescribed therapeutic trough level may not be necessary for full diuretic effect. Because , as opposed to the diuretic effect , the side effect profile of aminophylline is dose-dependent , low maintenance dosing may optimize the balance<symptom> between providing adjunctive diuretic effect while minimizing the risk of toxicity.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
