  Numerous studies have investigated the antibacterial effect of both silver ions and silver nanomaterials on a large diversity of environmentally and clinically relevant bacteria. However , contradictory results are reported in which inhibition concentrations were varying by a 10-fold. This study investigated whether this variance in results could be attributed to the difference in experimental conditions , especially the microbial growth medium.
