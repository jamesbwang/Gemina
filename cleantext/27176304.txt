  The underlying pathophysiology of ischemia and its electrocardiographic consequences are poorly understood , resulting in unreliable diagnosis of this disease. This limited knowledge of underlying mechanisms suggests a data driven approach , which seeks to identify patterns in the ECG that can be linked statistically to underlying behavior and conditions of ischemic stress. The gold standard ECG metrics for evaluating ischemia monitor vertical deflections within the ST segment. However , ischemia influences all portions of the electrogram. Another metric that targets the QRS complex during ischemia is Conduction Velocity ( CV). An even more inclusive , data driven approach is known as `` Laplacian Eigenmaps '' ( LE) , which can identify trajectories , or `` manifolds '' , that respond to different spatiotemporal consequences of ischemic stress , and these changes to the trajectories on the manifold may serve as a clinically relevant biomarker. On this study , we compared the LE- and CV-based markers against two gold standards for detecting ischemic stress , both derived from the ST segment. We evaluated the response time and fidelity of each biomarker using a Time to Threshold ( TTT) and Contrast Ratio ( CR) measure , over 51 episodes recorded as cardiac electrograms from a canine model of controlled ischemia. The results show that metrics designed to monitor regions beyond the ST segment can perform at least as well , if not better , than traditional ST segment based metrics.
