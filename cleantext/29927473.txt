  Wnt-spectrum vitreoretinopathies are a group of rare inherited disorders of retinal angiogenesis that include familial exudative vitreoretinopathy/Norrie disease and are most commonly autosomal dominant; however , they can rarely present with other inheritance patterns that are more difficult to diagnose. The authors describe a case of an uncle misdiagnosed as congenital toxoplasmosis<disease> for decades and his 2-month-old nephew presenting with bilateral retinal detachments. Genetic analysis revealed an NDP gene mutation in the child and the uncle , as well as heterozygosity of the mother confirming a Wnt-spectrum vitreoretinopathy. This report describes the evaluation , diagnosis , and importance of early laser stabilization of this disorder. ( Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2018; 49:446-450.).
