  We consider two key parameters that have been proposed to be important for vibrational energy delocalization , closely related to intramolecular vibrational redistribution ( IVR) , in molecules. These parameters are the symmetry of the molecule , and the presence of torsional ( internal rotor) modes of a methyl group. We consider four para-disubstituted benzene molecules and examine their vibrational character. The molecules selected are para-difluorobenzene , para-chlorofluorobenzene , para-fluorotoluene , and para-xylene. This set of molecules allows the above parameters to be assessed in a systematic way. The probe we use is zero-electron-kinetic-energy ( ZEKE) spectroscopy , which is employed in a resonant scheme , where the intermediate levels are selected vibrational levels of the S1 excited electronic state , with wavenumbers up to 1300 cm-1. We conclude that symmetry , and the presence of a methyl groups , do indeed have a profound effect on `` restricted '' IVR at low energies. This is underpinned by serendipitous coincidences in the energies of the levels , owing to small shifts in vibrational wavenumbers between molecules , so bringing levels into resonance. Additionally , methyl groups play an important role in opening up new routes for coupling between vibrations of different symmetry , and this is critical in the transition to `` statistical '' IVR at lower energies for molecules that contain them. Further , the presence of two methyl groups in the symmetrically-substituted p-xylene causes more widespread IVR than does the single methyl group in the asymmetrically-substituted p-fluorotoluene.
