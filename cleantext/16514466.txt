  For H ₂ separation by Pd-based composite membranes<symptom> , the pore mouth<symptom> size distribution of the porous support immediately affects the quality of the deposited layer , including continuity and defect/pinhole formation. However , there is a lack of convenient and effective methods for characterization of pore mouth<symptom> size of porous supports as well as of defect distribution of dense Pd-based composite membranes<symptom>. Here we introduce a novel method by modifying conventional liquid ⁻ liquid displacement porometry. When the pore tunnels are filled with Liquid B and the outer surface is occupied by Liquid A , the reopening of the pore mouth<symptom> depends on the pressure of Liquid B and the interfacial tension at the position of the pore mouth<symptom> , from which the pore mouth<symptom> size can be determined according to the Young ⁻ Laplace equation. Our experimental tests using this method with model samples show promising results , which are well supported by those obtained using FESEM ( fild emission scanning electron microscope) , AFM ( atomic force microscope) , and conventional liquid ⁻ liquid displacement porometry. This novel method can provide useful information for not only surface coatings on porous substrates but also for modification of dense membrane defects; thus , broad utilizations of this technique can be expected in future study.
