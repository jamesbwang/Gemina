  to identify the relationship between environmental factors and errors in the preparation and administration of antibacterial. an observational , cross-sectional study conducted between August and December , 2014 in two clinical units. The sample consisted of 265 doses of medication , observed in different shifts that through a form had the environmental conditions of noise , illumination , humidity , temperature and physical space measured in the preparation and administration stages. the physical dimension for the preparation was inadequate in one unit ( 3.8 m2) , and the items illumination , temperature and noise were extremely oscillating in the three shifts and in the two clinics , with averages generally higher than the recommended for the hospital environment , however , variations in illumination and noise were not statistically significant to cause dose errors or erroneous medicine choice ( p > 0.05). the environmental variables analyzed may favor medication errors in both the preparation and administration stages.
