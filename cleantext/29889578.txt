  Minimally invasive endoscopic haematoma evacuation is widely used in the treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage. However , its technique still has room for improvement. A new modified neuroendoscope technology ( MNT) was used in this study and we explored its safety and efficacy in the treatment of severe acute intraventricular haemorrhage by comparing it with extraventricular drainage plus urokinase thrombolytic ( EVD + UT) therapy. The following parameters were compared between the MNT group and the control group: incision design , operation time , ICU monitoring time , ventricular drainage tube ( VDT) placement time , post-operative drainage tube obstruction ( PDTO) rate , post-operative complications rate , 6-month mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale ( GOS). A total of 85 patients were enrolled. The ICU monitoring times , VDT placement times , PDTO rate were shorter in the MNT group. Multivariable logistic regression identified that good medium-term outcome ( GOS scores 4-5) was significantly associated with MNT applied ( OR 1.017 , 95 % CI 1.005-1.029 , p = 0.008) , age under 65 years ( OR 4.223 , 95 % CI , 1.322-17.109 , p = 0.034) and pre-operation GCS scores more than 10 ( OR 3.427 , 95 % CI 1.048-11.205 , p = 0.040). MNT surgery for severe intraventricular haematoma evacuation is a safe and efficient new surgical option. This technique is minimally invasive and may be helpful to provide good outcomes for selected patients.
