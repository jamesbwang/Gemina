  To describe the quality of online information on testosterone replacement therapy ( TRT) in men. A quantitative content analysis was conducted on websites providing patient-directed information on TRT for the purpose of treating late onset hypogonadism ( LOH). Websites were identified through Google in March 2017. The DISCERN instrument was used to determine the quality of health information. A total of 20 websites met inclusion criteria. Websites were primarily from the United States ( 45 %) , United Kingdom ( 25 %) , and Australia ( 15 %). Sources of information were cited by 40 % of websites. Several websites ( 40 %) claimed that TRT had benefits , with 25 % claiming that TRT was effective for treating LOH. TRT was described as a safe therapy by one website ( 5 %) , with gynecomastia ( 35 %) and increased hematocrit ( 35 %) representing the most commonly described side effects. Prostate specific antigen ( 35 %) and serum testosterone monitoring ( 30 %) were the most commonly described monitoring parameters. The mean DISCERN score was 46.4 , indicating fair quality information. The Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level was 12.2. Online TRT information is incomplete , often failing to describe important safety information and the need for regular monitoring.
