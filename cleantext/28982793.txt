  The aim was to evaluate Virtual Non-Contrast ( VNC)- CT images for the detection of acute infarcts in the brain after mechanical thrombectomy using a dual-layer spectral CT. 29 patients between September 2016 and February 2017 with unenhanced head spectral-CT after mechanical thrombectomy and available follow-up images ( MRI , n: 26; CT , n: 3) were included. VNC-CT and conventional CT ( CT) images were reconstructed using dedicated software. Based on those , contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR) , and the volume of infarction were measured semi-automatically in VNC-CT , CT and MRI. Furthermore , two readers independently assessed the VNC-CT and CT images in a randomized order by using the ASPECT score , and inter-rater reliability , sensitivity and specificity were calculated. CNR was significantly higher in VNC-CT compared to CT ( 3.1 ± 1.5 versus 1.1 ± 1.1 , p < 0.001). The mean estimated volume of infarction was significantly higher in VNC-CT compared to CT ( 72 % versus 55 % of the volume measured in MRI , p < 0.005). Inter-rater reliability was higher in VNC-CT compared to CT ( 0.751 versus 0.625) and sensitivity was higher in VNC-CT compared to CT ( 73 % versus 55 %). In conclusion , acute ischemic lesions<symptom> after mechanical thrombectomy are better definable in VNC-CT compared to CT images using a dual-layer spectral CT system.
