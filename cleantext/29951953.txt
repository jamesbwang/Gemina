  Currently , the primary therapeutic strategy for most growth hormone-producing pituitary adenomas ( GHPA) is surgery. Due to the invasiveness of GHPA , high recurrence has limited the benefit of complete adenoma removal surgery. Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 ( EGFL7) is a secreted factor implicated in tumor angiogenesis , growth , invasiveness and metastasis in GHPA. Herein , we observed that the expression level of EGFL7 and p-EGFR in invasive GHPA was much higher than that of non-invasive GHPA. The overexpression of EGFL7 was positively correlated with activation of EGFR ( p-EGFR). Noticeably , EGFL7 knockdown significantly inhibited activation of EGFR signaling cascades , including p-ERGR , p-AKT and p-ERK. Further studies showed that EGFL7 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of EGFR-pathway , using EGFR inhibitor Tyrphostin AG-1478 , significantly suppressed migration and invasion of GH3 and GT1-1 cells. In summary , our findings suggest that EGFL7 is a key factor for regulation of EGFR signaling pathway and plays an important role in migration and invasion of invasive GHPA.
