  To investigate the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) and subsequent Parkinson disease ( PD). Linked English national Hospital Episode Statistics and mortality data ( 1999-2011) were used to conduct a retrospective cohort study. A cohort of individuals admitted for hospital care with a coded diagnosis of T2DM was constructed , and compared to a reference cohort. Subsequent PD risk was estimated using Cox regression models. Individuals with a coded diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease , vascular parkinsonism , drug-induced parkinsonism , and normal pressure hydrocephalus<symptom> were excluded from the analysis. A total of 2,017,115 individuals entered the T2DM cohort and 6,173,208 entered the reference cohort. There were significantly elevated rates of PD following T2DM ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.32 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.29-1.35; We report an increased rate of subsequent PD following T2DM in this large cohort study. These findings may reflect shared genetic predisposition and/or disrupted shared pathogenic pathways with potential clinical and therapeutic implications.
