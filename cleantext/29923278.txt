  The Western Australian lung transplant program commenced in 2004 to serve the growing demand of patients with end-stage lung disease. This report summarises our eleven-year experience in lung transplantation. Data on 115 consecutive patients and their respective donors transplanted between 2004 and 2015 was collected. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Cox regression was used to analyse impact of donor and recipient characteristics on survival. A total of 88 bilateral , 22 single-lung and 5 heart-lung transplants were performed in Western Australia during the first 11 years of the lung transplant program. The most common indications for transplantation were Interstitial Lung Disease ( 30.4 %) , Cystic<disease> Fibrosis<disease> ( 27.8 %) , and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( excluding alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) ( 22.6 %). Median recipient age was 50 years. Overall survival rates were 96 % at 3 months , 93 % at 1 year , 84 % at 3 years , and 70 % at 5 years. Older age , higher BMI , and lower donor to recipient height ratio negatively impacted survival. Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction was the leading cause of late mortality. Lung transplantation is a treatment option in end-stage lung disease , with annual transplant rates in Western Australia continuing to rise. Our patients enjoy survival rates that compare favourably against international standards. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
