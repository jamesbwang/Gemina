  The aim of the current study was to measure the expression of acetyl-N-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro ( ACSDKP) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) and the effect of prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor ( POPi) on the bone<disease> marrow stromal cells of these patients. Serum and bone<disease> marrow stromal cell samples were collected from 33 patients with AML admitted to Wuxi Second People 's Hospital , Nanjing Medical University between September 2011 and August 2016. ACSDKP levels were measured using a highly specific competitive enzyme immunoassay ( EIA). Bone<disease> marrow stromal cells were treated with synthetic ACSDKP ( 10 µM/ml) or different concentrations of POPi S17092 ( 25 , 50 and 100 µg/ml). Cells that received no treatment were used as control. An MTT assay was conducted to measure the proliferation of bone<disease> marrow stromal cells. The results demonstrated that serum levels of ACSDKP in patients with AML were significantly higher than those of controls ( P < 0.05). Following treatment with ACSDKP , cell proliferation was significantly increased compared with untreated cells ( P < 0.05). However , following treatment with different concentrations of POPi , the expression of ACSDKP was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner ( P < 0.05). Furthermore , the proliferation of bone<disease> marrow stromal cells was also decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore , the present study demonstrated that ACSDKP levels were increased in the serum and bone<disease> marrow stromal cells of patients with AML and that ACSDKP promoted the proliferation of bone<disease> marrow stromal cells of these patients , which was inhibited by POPi. These results may identify a novel target for the treatment of AML.
