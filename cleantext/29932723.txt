  The famous vanishing of the density of states ( DOS) in a band gap , be it photonic or electronic , pertains to the infinite-crystal limit. In contrast , all experiments and device applications refer to finite crystals , which raises the question: Upon increasing the linear size L of a crystal , how fast does the DOS approach the infinite-crystal limit? We present a theory for finite crystals that includes Bloch-mode broadening due to the presence of crystal boundaries. Our results demonstrate that the DOS for frequencies inside a band gap has a 1/L scale dependence for crystals in one , two and three dimensions.
