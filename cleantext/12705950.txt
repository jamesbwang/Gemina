  Tagetes patula ( marigold) and Petunia grandiflora ( petunia) have been shown to exhibit potential in phytoremediation of environmental pollutants including heavy metals and textile dyes. To investigate their phytoremediation potential of diesel , it was necessary to evaluate diesel phytotoxicity of these two ornamental plants. Marigold and petunia seeds were incubated , for 10 and 15 days , respectively , in deionised water contaminated with 0 to 4 % , v/v , diesel in Petri dishes in a growth room with continuous lighting at 25 Â°C. It was found that as far as seed germination was concerned , petunia was less sensitive than marigold to 4 % diesel in water. In contrast , petunia exhibited poorer seedling root growth than marigold in the presence of diesel contamination. This finding of differential sensitivity of these two ornamental plants to diesel-contaminated water during germination and seedling growth has not been reported before. Therefore , the implications of phytotoxicity evaluation and comparison between different species or genotypes of plants at both seed germination and postgermination seedling growth should both be taken into consideration in screening tolerant plants for phytoremediation.
