  Early Maladaptive Schema ( EMS) are self-beliefs regarding oneself , others and the world , developed in childhood as the result of cumulative negative experiences ( Young , 1993). High levels of EMS are present in the opioid using population along with high levels of emotional dysregulation and maladaptive coping alongside traits of resilience. The study explored the associations between EMS in relation to emotional dysregulation , maladaptive coping , adaptive coping and resilience between a clinical group composed of opioid dependent polydrug users attending a facility for opioid substitution treatment ( n = 52) and a healthy comparison group ( n = 70). A cross-sectional design was used to compare group differences using MANOVAs , and multiple regression analysis identified associations between EMS and emotional dysregulation , coping and resilience. The groups significantly differed in relation to emotional dysregulation , maladaptive coping , adaptive coping and resilience. Specific EMS were significant independent predictors in regards to high emotional dysregulation , maladaptive coping , adaptive coping and resilience. EMS appear to have a significant impact on emotional dysregulation , coping and resilience. Clinical implications suggest that EMS should be addressed when treating opioid dependent polydrug users.
