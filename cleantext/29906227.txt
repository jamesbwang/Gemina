  Hypertension , obesity , and endothelial function predict cardiovascular disease in women and these factors are interrelated. We hypothesized that hypertension and obesity are associated with endothelial dysfunction in young women , and that short-term ethinyl estradiol exposure mitigates this dysfunction. We examined flow-mediated dilation responses before and during 7 days of oral ethinyl estradiol ( 30 µg/day) in 19 women ( 25 ± 5 , 18-35 yrs). We divided our sample into two groups based on two criteria: blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and obesity. Women were divided into normal ( NBP; n = 7 , mean arterial pressure range: 78-91 mmHg) and high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( HBP; n = 9 , mean arterial pressure range: 95-113 mmHg) groups. We also stratified our subjects by body composition ( lean: 18-31 % , n = 8; obese: 38-59 % , n = 9). We evaluated brachial flow-mediated dilation ( FMD) following two distinct shear stress stimuli: occlusion-alone , and occlusion with ischemic handgrip exercise. Obesity was unrelated to both flow-mediated dilation responses. Prior to ethinyl estradiol administration , HBP had blunted ischemic exercise responses relative to NBP ( 8.0 ( plus minus) 3.5 % vs. 12.3 ± 3.2 % , respectively; P = 0.05). However , during ethinyl estradiol administration , ischemic exercise responses increased in HBP ( 12.8 ± 6.1 %; P = 0.04) but decreased in NBP ( 5.6 ± 2.4 % , P = 0.01). Standard flow-mediated dilation did not reveal differences between groups. In summary , 1) moderately high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> predicted endothelial impairment; 2) ethinyl estradiol administration had divergent effects on FMD in normal vs. high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> women; 3) enhanced flow-mediated dilation ( ischemic handgrip exercise) revealed differences in endothelial function whereas standard flow-mediated dilation ( occlusion-alone) did not.
