  Transformation of white adipose tissue ( WAT) to a brown adipose tissue-like ( BAT-like) phenotype has emerged as an attractive approach against obesity e.g. using g ß3 adrenergic receptor agonists. These could however , produce side-effects following systemic exposure. The present study explored the possibility of local use of CL-316,243- a selective ß3 agonist- to circumvent this problem. Rats treated s.c. for 2 weeks ( 0.3 and 1 mg/kg) showed decreased inguinal fat pad ( IFP) weight/volume , increased UCP-1 staining and expressed BAT-like features in H&E stained micrographs. Interscapular BAT increased in weight/volume. In contrast , local treatment into the IFP was not efficacious in terms of weight/volume , despite slight increases in UCP-1 staining and changes in histological features. After local treatment , the exposure of the IFP was lower than after systemic treatment. In turn higher local doses ( 0.5 and 5 mg/ml) were then tested which produced a strong trend for decreased volume of the IFP , a significant increase in UCP-1 staining , and also a decrease in adipocytes size but increased number. However , after this treatment the systemic exposure was in the same range as following systemic treatment. In conclusion , we saw no evidence for the possibility of converting inguinal WAT to a BAT-phenotype solely through local activation of ß3 receptors. This is in concert with our in vitro experiments which detected direct effects of PPARγ agonists at the gene/protein expression and functional level , but were unable to detect any effect of CL-316,243.
