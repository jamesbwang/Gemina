  The management of branch-duct IPMN remains controversial due to the relatively low rate of malignant degeneration and the uncertain predictive role of high-risk stigmata ( HRS) and worrisome features ( WFs) identified by the 2012 International Consensus Guidelines. Our aim was to evaluate the evolution of originally low-risk ( Fukuoka-negative) BD-IPMNs during a long follow-up period in order to determine whether the appearance of any clinical or morphological variables may be independently associated with the development of malignancy over time. A prospectively collected database of all patients with BD-IPMN referring to our Institute between 2002 and 2016 was retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analysis of association between changes during follow-up , including appearance of HRS/WFs , and development of malignancy ( high-grade dysplasia/invasive carcinoma) was performed. A total of 167 patients were selected for analysis , and seven developed malignant disease ( 4.2 %). During a median follow-up time of 55 months , HRS appeared in only three cases but predicted malignancy with 100 % specificity. Worrisome features , on the other hand , appeared in 44 patients ( 26.3 %). Appearance of mural nodules<symptom> and MPD dilatation > 5 mm showed a significant association with malignancy in multivariate analysis ( p = 0.004 and p = 0.001 , respectively). MPD dilatation in particular proved to be the strongest independent risk factor for development of malignancy ( OR = 24.5). The risk of pancreatic malignancy in this population is low but definite. The presence of major WFs , and especially MPD dilatation , should prompt a tighter follow-up with EUS and a valid cytological analysis whenever feasible.
