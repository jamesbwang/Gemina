  Micro/nanoscale carrier is a crucial component of the drug delivery system that enables to be well designed for improving the pharmacological and therapeutic properties of drug administration. Herein we systemically review a special vector of natural poly ( amino acid) ( PAA) that has been extensively applied in the controlled delivery of drug , protein and gene due to its excellent biocompatibility , controlled degradability , and flexible physicochemical modification. Natural PAA is a group of poly ( ionic) molecules that present various biological roles and putative technical functions. The intention of this review is to thoroughly summarize three classic types of PAA involving anionic , cationic and neutral PAA as well as their applications on drug delivery systems.
