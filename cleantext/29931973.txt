  Virus-inspired mimics for gene therapy have attracted increasing attention because viral vectors show robust efficacy owing to the highly infectious nature and efficient endosomal escape. Nonetheless , until now , synthetic materials have failed to achieve high `` infectivity , '' and especially , the mimicking of virus spikes for `` infection '' is underappreciated. Herein , a virus spike mimic by a zinc ( Zn) coordinative ligand that shows high affinity toward phosphate-rich cell membranes<symptom> is reported. Surprisingly , this ligand also demonstrates superior functionality of destabilizing endosomes. Therefore , the Zn coordination is more likely to imitate the virus nature with high cell binding and endosomal membrane disruption. Following this , the Zn coordinative ligand is functionalized on a bioreducible cross-linked peptide with alkylation that imitates the viral lipoprotein shell. The ultimate virus-mimicking nanoparticle closely imitates the structures and functions of viruses , leading to robust transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly , apart from targeting ligand- and cell-penetrating peptide , the metal coordinative ligand may provide another option to functionalize diverse biomaterials for enhanced efficacy , demonstrating its broad referential significance to pursue nonviral vectors with high performance.
