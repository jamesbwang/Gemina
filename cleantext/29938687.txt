  Surface plasmons ( SPs) , in which the free electrons are collectively excited on the metal surface , have been successfully used in chemical analysis and signal detection. Generally , SPs possess two types of decay channels. SPs decay either nonradiatively via the generation of hot electrons or radiatively through re-emitted photons , which can trigger surface chemical reactions when the molecules are adsorbed on the surface of metal nanoparticles. An excitation light with a special wavelength is irradiated on the surface of the plasmonic nanostructure , the strong coupling interaction between electrons and light will then occur on this , and this is followed by the development of a series of unique properties. 2D materials have been a hot topic of research for more than a decade , since graphene was found in 2004. Recently , the combination of graphene with metal NPs has been shown to possess many supernormal advantages , such as high stability and catalytic activity , which have been successfully applied in plasmon-exciton co-driven chemical reactions.
