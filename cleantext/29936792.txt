  The RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin ( TTP) binds to adenosine- uridine AU-rich elements in the 3 '- untranslated region of messenger RNAs and facilitates rapid degradation of the target mRNAs. Therefore , it regulates the expression of multiple cancer and immunity-associated transcripts. Furthermore , a lack of TTP in cancer cells influences cancer progression and predicts poor survival. Although the functions of TTP on cancer cells have previously been researched , the mechanism of TTP on the interaction between cancer cells with their microenvironment remains undiscovered. In this study , we admed to determine the role of cancer cell TTP during the interaction between tumor and immune cells , specifically regulatory T cells ( Tregs). We evaluate the capability of TTP to modulate the antitumor immunity of GC and explored the underlying mechanism. The overexpression of TTP in GC cells dramatically increased peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocyte<symptom> ( PBML)- mediated cytotoxicity against GC cells. Increased cytotoxicity against TTP-overexpressed GC cells by PBMLs was determined by Treg development and infiltration. Surprisingly , we found the stabilization of programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1) mRNA was declining while TTP was elevated. The PDL1 protein level was reduced in TTP-abundant GC cells. PD-L1 gas been found to play a pivotal role in Treg development and functional maintenance in immune system. Taken together , our results suggest the overexpression of TTP in GC cells not only affects cell survival and apoptosis but also increases PBMLs- mediated cytotoxicity against GC cells to decelerate tumor progression. Moreover , we identified PD-L1 as a critical TTP-regulated factor that contributes to inhibiting antitumor immunity.
