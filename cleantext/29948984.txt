  Diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of death due to the persistent hyperglycemia that leads to potential complications. Lack of patients ' adherence to their prescribed medication regimens , due to the requirement of frequent dosing , leads to failure of 40-50 % of patients to manage their disease. Thus , microsponges of the novel short half-life mitiglinide calcium ( MTG) were formulated using Quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion method , employing Eudragit RS100 , ethyl cellulose , and polyvinyl alcohol , then characterized in terms of production yield , entrapment efficiency , particle size , in vitro buoyancy , in vitro drug release , and in vivo pharmacokinetics in rabbits. Optimization was done using response surface methodology; the optimized formulation was investigated by FTIR , DSC , and SEM. Results revealed that the optimized MTG microsponge was successfully formulated with high production yield ( 61.61 % ± 0.6) , entrapment efficiency ( 77.7 % ± 1.37) , and particle size of 192.76 μm and it remained buoyant over simulated gastric fluid for 24 h with high percentage of in vitro buoyancy ( 91.01 % ± 2.5). Moreover , it sustained the in vitro drug release with cumulative % release of 83.74 ± 1.5 after 24 h. This microsponge was highly porous in nature with interconnected pores where MTG was entrapped with good compatibility as confirmed by SEM , DSC , and FTIR analysis; Pharmacokinetic studies showed improvement in C
