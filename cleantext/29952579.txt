  The current study presents a comprehensive framework of campus racial climate and tests the validity and reliability of a new measure , the School Climate for Diversity Scale-College , in three independent samples. The scale measures 10 dimensions of campus racial climate in the two domains of intergroup interactions ( frequency of interaction , quality of interaction , equal status , support for positive interaction , and stereotyping) and campus racial socialization ( cultural socialization , mainstream socialization , promotion of cultural competence , colorblind socialization , and critical consciousness<symptom> socialization). Participants were college students drawn from an online task system and a public university on the West Coast. Study 1 provided evidence of reliability and validity with existing measures of college climate , whereas Study 2 provided evidence of factor stability through exploratory factor analysis as well as additional evidence of discriminant and concurrent validity. Finally , Study 3 replicated the factor structure of Study 2 and provided further evidence of validity. ( PsycINFO Database Record
