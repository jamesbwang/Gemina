  Rehabilitation services are increasingly targeting involvement in daily life. In the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health this is referred to as `` participation ''. How-ever , questions have arisen regarding the conceptualization of participation , and consensus is lacking. The first phase of this study is a critical review of the literature to detect recurring conceptual problems in the application of participation and how researchers deal with these. The second phase is a systematic review to identify how participation measures are operationalized. The critical review found possible solutions to 4 recurring key limitations: ( i) how to deal with ambiguity and vagueness regarding the term `` participation ''; ( ii) how to differentiate between activity and participation; ( iii) what is the current empirical knowledge about the subjective aspects of participation; ( iv) what are the different ways to measure participation. The systematic review found 18 instruments operationalizing participation in different ways: ( i) unidimensional: frequency of performing activities; ( ii) unidimensional: limitations in experiencing participation when performing activities; ( iii) multidimensional: multiple subjective dimensions when performing activities; and ( iv) multidimensional: objective and subjective dimensions. Notwithstanding an increasing body of knowledge , some issues remain unclear and how participation is measured is subject to debate. This results in difficulties in the use of participation in clinical practice. However , insight into the current body of knowledge and awareness of shortcomings might help clinicians who aim to apply participation in practice.
