  The aim was to evaluate the regenerative effect of epineural injection of rat ASCs ( rASCs) in three different settings of acute and chronic compression in a rat sciatic nerve model. Acute compression ( 60 s) with a vessel clamp over a distance of 1 mm ( group 1) or 10 mm ( group 2) , as well as chronic compression with a permanent remaining , nonabsorbable polymeric clip over a distance of 1 mm ( group 3) was performed. Depending on the group , either 5 Ã— 10 The rats in group 2 had a better function than those with group 1 at one and especially at 2 weeks. After 4 weeks however , almost all rats were close to a normal function. There was a similar Muscle<symptom> Weight Ratio ( MWR) after 2 weeks in all groups , whereas after 4 weeks , the MWR in group 3 was lower compared with group 1 and 2. Histomorphometric analysis showed a better myelination in group 1 & 2 compared to group 3 after 4 weeks. ASCs have a beneficial effect on myelin thickness ( G-Ratio). We successfully evaluated the regenerative effect of epineural injection of rASCs in three different settings of acute and chronic compression. However , there were no significant differences in outcomes between the ASC-treated groups and control groups.
