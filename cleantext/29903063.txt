  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC) is a common epithelial malignancy that occurs in the nasopharynx and it is one of the high incidences of malignant tumors in China. As previous reports , berberine hydrochloride ( BH) possesses a repressive effect on the proliferation of various cancer types. But the application of BH was hampered for a long time due to its hydrophobic properties , along with poor stability and bioavailability. In this study , folate acid modified chitosan nanoparticles loaded berberine hydrochloride ( BH/FA-CTS NPs) were prepared by the ionic cross-linking technique , the physicochemical properties and the influence of BH/FA-CTS NPs on proliferation , migration and apoptosis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-1 cells were studied in vitro and in vivo. Results of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) images showed that BH/FA-CTS NPs were sphere and the diameter was 258.2 ± 9.1 nm. The drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were 8.17 ± 1.12 % and 87.73 ± 4.21 % , respectively. The drug release kinetics exhibited a slower and sustained release over a period of 48 h. Moreover , results of MTT assay and scratch assay displayed that BH/FA-CTS NPs inhibited proliferation and migration of CNE-1 cells remarkably. BH/FA-CTS NPs promoted apoptosis and necrosis<symptom> of CNE-1 cells. And BH/FA-CTS NPs displayed distinguished higher tumor inhibition than control group , free BH and BH/CTS NPs in vivo. Therefore , as a nanocomposite , BH/FA-CTS NPs provide a new method and option for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.
