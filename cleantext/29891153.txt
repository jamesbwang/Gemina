  To compare outcomes of phacoemulsification combined with viscocanalostomy , endocyclophotocoagulation ( ECP) , or ab interno trabulectomy for intraocular pressure ( IOP) control and safety in eyes with open-angle glaucoma and visually significant cataract. Farabi Eye Hospital , Tehran , Iran. Retrospective case series. Medical records of patients who had combined surgery and were followed for at least 1 year were reviewed. Complete success , postoperative IOP , number of medications at each visit , and complications were evaluated and compared before and after adjustments for confounders. Forty-six eyes had combined phacoviscocanalostomy , 35 had phaco-ECP , and 28 eyes phaco-ab interno trabulectomy. The groups were matched for baseline IOP ( P = .24). At the final follow-up ( mean 17.2 months ± 5.5 ( SD)) , the phacoviscocanalostomy group had the lowest mean IOP ( 13.5 ± 4.7 mm Hg , 29 % decrease) ( P = .01). There was no significant difference in the final IOP between phaco-ECP and phaco-ab interno trabulectomy ( 16.4 ± 3.9 mm Hg , 20 % decrease versus 15.8 ± 4.2 mm Hg , 15 % decrease) ( P = .88). The reduction in the number of medications was greater with phacoviscocanalostomy ( 77 %) than with phaco-ECP ( 40 %) and phaco-ab interno trabulectomy ( 44 %) ( P = .01). Phacoemulsification-ab interno trabulectomy had the fewest complications. Intraocular pressure spikes were more frequent in the phaco-ECP group ( 20 %) than in the other groups ( 4 %) ( P = .05). All procedures significantly lowered IOP. Phacoemulsification-ab interno trabulectomy resulted in fewest complications and phacoviscocanalostomy led to the largest IOP drop and largest reduction of medications.
