  Physical activity ( PA) and body mass index ( BMI) are consistently associated with motor coordination ( MC) in children. However , we know very little how BMI in early childhood associates with MC later in childhood. This study investigated associations between BMI in early childhood and BMI , PA , and MC in middle childhood. Children aged 5 to 7 years ( n = 64 , 32 girls) were measured for MC using Körperkoordinationstest für Kinder ( KTK) and for moderate-to-vigorous PA ( MVPA) using triaxial accelerometers. Prevailing body<symptom> weight and height were measured , and information on weight and height in early years was based on parental report of child health care report cards. Age-adjusted BMIz scores were calculated on the basis of international growth curve references. Associations and the explained variability of MC were investigated by Pearson correlations and a hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Age and MVPA were found to be significantly associated with MC at middle childhood , in general. BMIz at middle childhood and at ages 4 and 5 years inversely explained 12 % ( p < 0.05) , 6 % ( p > 0.05) , and 7 % ( p > 0.05) of the variation in MC in girls after adjusting for covariates , respectively. In boys , BMIz scores did not show any trend of association with MC. This study suggests sex-specific mechanisms in the interplay between BMI and motor development in childhood.
