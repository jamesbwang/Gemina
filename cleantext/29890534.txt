  This study evaluated the effects of tibial plateau levelling osteotomy on cranial tibial subluxation and tibial rotation angle in a model of feline cranial cruciate ligament deficient stifle joint. Quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles were simulated with cables , turnbuckles and a spring in an ex vivo limb model. Cranial tibial subluxation and tibial rotation angle were measured radiographically before and after cranial cruciate ligament section , and after tibial plateau levelling osteotomy , at postoperative tibial plateau angles of +5 ° , 0 ° and -5 °. Cranial tibial subluxation and tibial rotation angle were not significantly altered after tibial plateau levelling osteotomy with a tibial plateau angle of +5 °. Additional rotation of the tibial plateau to a tibial plateau angle of 0 ° and -5 ° had no significant effect on cranial tibial subluxation and tibial rotation angle , although 2 out of 10 specimens were stabilized by a postoperative tibial plateau angle of -5 °. No stabilization of the cranial cruciate ligament deficient stifle was observed in this model of the feline stifle , after tibial plateau levelling osteotomy. Given that stabilization of the cranial cruciate ligament deficient stifle was not obtained in this model , simple transposition of the tibial plateau levelling osteotomy technique from the dog to the cat may not be appropriate.
