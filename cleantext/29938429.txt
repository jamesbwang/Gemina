  Background: Primary health care is the backbone of comprehensive healthcare systems , and family physicians complement horizontal health coverage. In the developed world family medicine is integral to new doctors ' training but , in the developing world , there are hurdles , e.g. , poorly targeted financing , lack of skills and resources , and little health professionals ' interest in the specialty. This study determined perceptions of undergraduate and postgraduate medical trainees and healthcare professionals in Pakistan about family medicine. Participants ' perceptions were examined via a selfadministered pre-structured questionnaire about family medicine in developing countries before and after a targeted seminar. Epi Info software ( v. 7) was used for statistical analysis. The p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. One hundred & eight questionnaires were returned postseminar demonstrating raised participant awareness of family medicine , with the majority ( postgraduate 90.00 % and undergraduate 90.91 %) believing that health departments should create family medicine specialist posts to encourage students and post-graduate trainees. Similarly , 89.77 % undergraduates and 95.00 % postgraduates believed that comprehensive family medicine in primary health could be a solution to improve health care in Pakistan. Of note , when asked pre-seminar `` do you feel you would consider family medicine as career speciality? '' , 42 % undergraduates replied yes; when asked the same question post-seminar 63 % of undergraduates and 90 % of postgraduates replied yes. Introducing family medicine as a subject in medical colleges will create awareness and interest towards this speciality; until then , awareness lectures and seminars by trained family physicians will help bridge the gap towards encouraging students about its benefits.
