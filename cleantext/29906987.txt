  The population dynamics of two interacting species modeled by the Lotka-Volterra ( LV) model with general parameters that can promote or suppress the other species is studied. It is found that the properties of the two species ' isoclines determine the interaction of species , leading to six regimes in the phase diagram of interspecies interaction; i.e. , there are six different interspecific relationships described by the LV model. Four regimes allow for nontrivial species coexistence , among which it is found that three of them are stable , namely , weak competition , mutualism , and predator-prey scenarios can lead to win-win coexistence situations. The Lyapunov function for general nontrivial two-species coexistence is also constructed. Furthermore , in the presence of spatial diffusion of the species , the dynamics can lead to steady wavefront propagation and can alter the population map. Propagating wavefront solutions in one dimension are investigated analytically and by numerical solutions. The steady wavefront speeds are obtained analytically via nonlinear dynamics analysis and verified by numerical solutions. In addition to the inter- and intraspecific interaction parameters , the intrinsic speed parameters of each species play a decisive role in species populations and wave properties. In some regimes , both species can copropagate with the same wave speeds in a finite range of parameters. Our results are further discussed in the light of possible biological relevance and ecological implications.
