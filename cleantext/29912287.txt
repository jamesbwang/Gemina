  Long-read , single-molecule sequencing platforms hold great potential for isoform discovery and characterization of multi-exon transcripts. However , their high error rates are an obstacle to distinguishing novel transcripts isoforms from sequencing artifacts. Therefore , we developed the package TranscriptClean to correct mismatches , microindels , and noncanonical splice junctions in mapped transcripts using the reference genome while preserving known variants. Our method corrects nearly all mismatches and indels present in a publically available human PacBio Iso-seq dataset , and rescues 39 % of noncanonical splice junctions. All Python and R scripts used in this paper are available at https://github.com/dewyman/TranscriptClean. None.
