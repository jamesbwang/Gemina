  To investigate the impact of conservative laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis with postoperative gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa) therapy on the pregnancy outcomes in patients with endometriosis-associated infertility<symptom>. The clinical data were collected from the patients with endometriosis-associated infertility<symptom> undergoing conservative laparoscopic surgery in our department between January , 2011 and December , 2016. The patients were divided into laparoscopic surgery only group ( without any other treatments) and postoperative GnRha therapy group , and the pregnancy outcomes were compared between the two groups at different time points during the follow-up. In cases with moderate or severe endometriosis , laparoscopic surgery with postoperative GnRha therapy was associated with a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate than laparoscopic surgery alone ( P < 0.05). In patients receiving postoperative GnRha therapy , the accumulative pregnancy rates at 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months after discontinuation of GnRha therapy were significantly higher than those in patients receiving laparoscopic surgery alone. The pregnancy rate following IVF-ET cycles was significantly higher than the spontaneous pregnancy rate in patients receiving conservative laparoscopic surgery alone ( P < 0.05) , while such a difference was not found in patients with postoperative GnRHa therapy ( P > 0.05). GnRHa therapy after conservative laparoscopic surgery can significantly increase the clinical pregnancy rate in infertile 6 months women with moderate or severe endometriosis but not in mild cases. Within 6 months following laparoscopic surgery or following discontinuation of GnRHa therapy is the optimal time window for pregnancy , and a longer time from therapy discontinuation is associated with a lower possibility of spontaneous pregnancy.
