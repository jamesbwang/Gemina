  Pseudotime algorithms can be employed to extract latent temporal information from cross-sectional data sets allowing dynamic biological processes to be studied in situations where the collection of time series data is challenging or prohibitive. Computational techniques have arisen from single-cell ` omics and cancer modelling where pseudotime can be used to learn about cellular differentiation or tumour progression. However , methods to date typically implicitly assume homogeneous genetic , phenotypic or environmental backgrounds , which becomes limiting as data sets grow in size and complexity. We describe a novel statistical framework that learns how pseudotime trajectories can be modulated through covariates that encode such factors. We apply this model to both single-cell and bulk gene expression data sets and show that the approach can recover known and novel covariate-pseudotime interaction effects. This hybrid regression-latent variable model framework extends pseudotemporal modelling from its most prevalent area of single cell genomics to wider applications.
