  We quantified the contributions of leading causes of death and drug overdose to changes in life expectancy at birth over time and inequalities by sex and socioeconomic status in British Columbia. From 2014 to 2016 , life expectancy at birth declined by 0.38 years and drug overdose deaths ( mainly opioid-involved) contributed a loss of 0.12 years of the decrease. The analysis also demonstrated that the higher drug overdose mortality among males and among those in lower socioeconomic status communities contributed to a differential decrease in life expectancy at birth for males and for those in the latter category.
