  Hydroalumination of R-P ( H)- C ( triple bond , length as m-dash) C-tBu with bulky H-Al ( CH ( SiMe3) 2) 2 afforded the new P-H functionalized Al/P-based frustrated Lewis pair R-P ( H)- C ( ( double bond , length as m-dash) C ( H)- tBu)- AlR2 ( R = CH ( SiMe3) 2; FLP 7). A weak adduct of 7 with benzonitrile ( 8) was detected by NMR spectroscopy , but could not be isolated. tert-Butyl isocyanide afforded a similar , but isolable adduct ( 9) , in which the isocyanide C atom was coordinated to aluminium. The unique reactivity of 7 became evident from its reactions with the heteroatom substituted nitriles PhO-C ( triple bond , length as m-dash) N , PhCH2S-C ( triple bond , length as m-dash) N and H8C4N-C ( triple bond , length as m-dash) N. Hydrophosphination of the C ( triple bond , length as m-dash) N triple bonds afforded imines at room temperature which were coordinated to the FLP by Al-N and P-C bonds to yield AlCPCN heterocycles ( 10 to 12). These processes depend on substrate activation by the FLP. Diphenylcyclopropenone and its sulphur derivative reacted with 7 by addition of the P-H bond to a C-C bond of the strained C3 ring and ring opening to afford the fragment ( Z)- Ph-C ( H) ( double bond , length as m-dash) C ( Ph)- C-X-Al ( X = O , S). The C-O or C-S groups were coordinated to the FLP to yield AlCPCX heterocycles ( 13 and 14). The thiocarbonyl derived compound 14 contains an internally stabilized phosphenium cation with a localized P ( double bond , length as m-dash) C bond , a trigonal planar coordinated P atom and a short P ( double bond , length as m-dash) C distance ( 168.9 pm). Insight into formation mechanisms , the structural and energetic properties of FLP 7 and compounds 13 and 14 was gained by quantum chemical DFT calculations.
