  Pre-diabetes is the underlying pathology for type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program is a proven , effective strategy to control or prevent type 2 diabetes; however , there is limited data on what motivates people with pre-diabetes to participate in a Diabetes Prevention Program. Cross-sectional analysis of survey data from adults with pre-diabetes was conducted from October to November 2015. Fisher 's exact test was utilized to examine relationships between study variables. Findings indicated that muscle strength was related to commitment to healthy lifestyle behaviors ( p = 0.02). Findings also suggested that perceived muscle strength could impact healthful living for patients with pre-diabetes. Future studies for individuals with pre-diabetes are needed to provide afull assessment of motivationfactors for participation in the Diabetes Prevention Program. Nurse Practitioners should work to improve perceived muscle strength in patients with pre-diabetes , which could translate into increased Diabetes Prevention Program attendance.
