  Annatto-derived tocotrienol ( AnTT) has been shown to improve bone formation in animal models of osteoporosis. However , detailed studies of the effects of AnTT on preosteoblastic cells were limited. This study was conducted to investigate the osteogenic effect of AnTT on preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells in a time-dependent manner. Murine MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells were cultured in the different concentrations of AnTT ( 0.001-1 µg/mL) up to 24 days. Expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers was measured by qPCR ( osterix ( OSX) , collagen 1 alpha 1 ( COL1α1) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) , and osteocalcin ( OCN)) and by fluorometric assay for ALP activity. Detection of collagen and mineralized nodules<symptom> was done via Direct Red staining and Alizarin Red staining , respectively. The results showed that osteoblastic differentiation-related genes , such as OSX , COL1α1 , ALP , and OCN , were significantly increased in the AnTT-treated groups compared to the vehicle group in a time-dependent manner ( Our results suggest that AnTT enhances the osteogenic activity by promoting the bone formation-related genes and proteins in a temporal and sequential manner.
