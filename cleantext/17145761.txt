  The fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) regulatory axis is phylogenetically ancient , evolving into a large mammalian/human gene family of 22 ligands that bind to four receptor tyrosine kinases for a complex physiologic system controlling cell growth , differentiation , and metabolism. The tissue targets for the primary FGF function are mainly in cartilage and in bone for morphogenesis , mineralization , and metabolism. A multitude of complexities in the FGF ligand-receptor signaling pathways have made translation into therapies for FGF-related bone disorders such as osteomalacia , osteoarthritis , and osteoporosis difficult but not impossible.
