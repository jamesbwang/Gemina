  ß-Blockers are weak bases with acidity constants related to their secondary amine group. At environmental pH they are protonated with the tendency to shift to their neutral species at more alkaline pH. Here we studied the influence of pH from 5.5 to 8.6 on the toxicity of the four ß-blockers atenolol , metoprolol , labetalol and propranolol in zebrafish embryos , relating toxicity not only in a conventional way to external aqueous concentrations but also to measured internal concentrations. Besides lethality , we evaluated changes in swimming activity and heartbeat , using the Locomotor Response ( LMR) method and the Vertebrate Automated Screening Technology ( VAST) for high throughput imaging. Effects of metoprolol , labetalol and propranolol were detected on phenotype , heart rate and swimming activity. External effect concentrations decreased with increasing neutral fraction for all three pharmaceuticals , attributed by an enhanced uptake of the neutral species in comparison to the corresponding charged form.
