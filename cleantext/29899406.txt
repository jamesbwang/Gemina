  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is one of the most common aggressive malignancies. Like other solid tumors , inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes occur during CRC development and progression. Recently , a novel tumor suppressor , LACTB , was proposed to inhibit tumor progression , but the functional and clinical significance of this tumor suppressor in CRC remains unexplored. Herein , we found LACTB was significantly downregulated in CRC due to promoter methylation and histone deacetylation , which was associated with metastasis and advanced clinical stage. CRC patients with low LACTB expression had poorer overall survival and LACTB also determined to be an independent prognostic factor for poorer outcome. Ectopic expression of LACTB suppressed CRC cells proliferation , migration , invasion , and epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in vitro and inhibited CRC growth and metastasis in vivo , while knockout of LACTB by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique resulted in an opposite phenotype. Interestingly , LACTB could exert antitumorigenic effect only in HCT116 and HCT8 cells harboring wild-type TP53 , but not in HT29 and SW480 cells harboring mutant TP53 or HCT116 p53
