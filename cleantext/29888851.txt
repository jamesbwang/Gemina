  Mosquito larvicides provide a source-reduction strategy to diminish adult females that bite and potentially spread pathogens. Demands are mounting for new and innovative effective biorational larvicides , due to the development of resistance to some currently utilized mosquito larvicides , undesirable non-target effects , and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA) restrictions. Methionine is a human nutrient essential amino acid that unexpectedly has been shown to be a valuable safe pest management tool against select insect pests that possess alkaline gut physiology. The present study evaluated larvicidal toxicity of methionine in several pestiferous mosquito ( Diptera: Culicidae) genera. Concentration-dependent DL-methionine kinetics assays of survival and pupation were conducted in larvae of Aedes<pathogen> albopictus Skuse , Anopheles<pathogen> quadrimaculatus Say , and Culex<pathogen> tarsalis Coquillett in glass jars. Higher concentrations of DL-methionine yielded 100 % mortality for all test species and prevented pupation at a rate equivalent to Bacillus<pathogen> thuringiensis<pathogen> israelensis<pathogen> ( Bti) treatments. Concentration kinetics indicated that An. quadrimaculatus was 10-fold more sensitive to DL-methionine than Ae. albopictus and Cx. tarsalis. EPA regulations currently exempt methionine in pesticide formulations applied to agricultural crops. This study demonstrates that methionine is a highly effective mosquito larvicide that can provide a beneficial new biorational , environmentally sustainable tool to control pestiferous mosquitoes.
