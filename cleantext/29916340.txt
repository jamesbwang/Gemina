  The exposure to solar radiation ( mainly due to the action of ultraviolet radiation) is one of the main causes for the premature failure of many polymeric materials , including the geotextiles. In this work , a nonwoven polypropylene geotextile ( stabilized with a known amount of a hindered amine light stabilizer) was exposed to ultraviolet-aging tests , both in the laboratory ( accelerated conditions) and outdoors ( natural conditions). The damage occurred in the geotextile ( caused by the ultraviolet-aging tests) was evaluated quantitatively ( by monitoring changes in its mass per unit area , thickness , and tensile properties) and qualitatively ( by scanning electron microscopy). The results , among other findings , showed that: ( 1) the ultraviolet-aging tests ( both in the laboratory and outdoors) induced relevant damage in the polypropylene fibers of the geotextile ( transverse cracks) , leading to the deterioration of its tensile behavior , ( 2) the amount of degradation increased with the increase of the ultraviolet radiant energy , ( 3) the laboratory tests caused a faster deterioration of the polypropylene fibers than the outdoor tests , and ( 4) the degradation found by scanning electron microscopy in the polypropylene fibers correlated well with the deterioration occurred in the tensile behavior of the geotextile.
