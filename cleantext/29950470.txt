  The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies hexavalent chromium ( Cr ( VI)) as a human carcinogen. As reported , cancer mortality was higher in Cr ( VI)- contaminated areas. Scientists have recommended studying its health impact on people living in contaminated areas. This study aims to evaluate the health risk for people living in Cr ( VI)- contaminated areas. We conducted a cross-sectional study in rural areas of north-eastern China. Malondialdehyde ( MDA) , glutathione peroxidase ( GSH-Px) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and catalase ( CAT) were used as oxidative stress parameters , and 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG) as a DNA damage biomarker. We collected information on demographics , lifestyles and length of residence from all participants using a questionnaire. Biological specimens and environmental media samples were collected on the same day as the survey was done. We used t-test , Ï‡ The study included 319 participants exposed to Cr ( VI) and 307 unexposed participants , with 447 women and 179 men. These participants met the following criteria: ( 1) living in the areas for more than 10 years; ( 2) age older than 18 years; and ( 3) without occupational chromium exposure. Our study revealed that serum concentration of MDA ( p < 0.001) , serum activities of CAT ( p < 0.001) and GSH-Px ( p < 0.001) , as well as urine concentration of 8-OHdG ( p = 0.008) in the exposed group were significantly higher than those in the unexposed group. However , serum SOD activity was significantly lower in the exposed group , compared with that in the unexposed group ( p < 0.001). Cr ( VI) exposure and smoking have an interaction effect on GSH-Px activity ( p < 0.05). Cr ( VI) exposure and alcohol drinking also have an interaction effect on GSH-Px activity ( p < 0.05). Longer residence in the exposed areas increased the oxidative levels ( p < 0.05). The findings of this study showed elevated oxidative stress and DNA damage in people exposed to Cr ( VI).
