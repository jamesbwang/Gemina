  Cervical vagus nerve schwannoma is rare and its surgical procedure is controversial. The tumor is in general benign and slowly growing without causing symptoms , and therefore it should be advised to remove the tumor while preserving neural function. We operated on two patients with cervical vagus nerve schwannoma with the inter-capsular resection technique proposed by Hashimoto et al. without causing neurological deficits. It is the first time that the plane between the tumor-complex capsule layer ( epineurium and perineurium) and true tumor capsule layer was histopathologically proved in this paper. The true tumor capsule layer contained no normal neural fibers , tumor tissues and neural sheath. The inter-capsular resection technique is a safe and reliable method for removing cervical vagus nerve schwannoma.
