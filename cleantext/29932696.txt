  We conjecture that the leading two-derivative tree-level amplitudes for gluons and gravitons can be derived from gauge invariance together with mild assumptions on their singularity structure. Assuming locality ( that the singularities are associated with the poles of cubic graphs) , we prove that gauge invariance in just n-1 particles together with minimal power counting uniquely fixes the amplitude. Unitarity in the form of factorization then follows from locality and gauge invariance. We also give evidence for a stronger conjecture: assuming only that singularities occur when the sum of a subset of external momenta go on shell , we show in nontrivial examples that gauge invariance and power counting demand a graph structure for singularities. Thus , both locality and unitarity emerge from singularities and gauge invariance. Similar statements hold for theories of Goldstone bosons like the nonlinear sigma model and Dirac-Born-Infeld by replacing the condition of gauge invariance with an appropriate degree of vanishing in soft limits.
