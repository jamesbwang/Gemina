  Type 2 diabetes , which accounts for ~ 90 % of all diabetes , is a heterogeneous and progressive disease with a variety of causative and potentiating factors. The hyperglycaemia of type 2 diabetes is often inadequately controlled , hence the need for a wider selection of glucose-lowering treatments. Medline , PubMed , Web of Science and Google Scholar. Early , effective and sustained control of blood glucose defers the onset and reduces the severity of microvascular and neuropathic complications of type 2 diabetes and helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular ( CV) complications. Newer glucose-lowering agents require extensive long-term studies to confirm CV safety. The positioning of newer agents within therapeutic algorithms varies. In addition to their glucose-lowering efficacy , some new glucose-lowering agents may act independently to reduce CV and renal complications. Studies of potential new glucose-lowering agents offer the opportunity to safely improve glycaemic control with prolonged efficacy and greater opportunity for therapeutic individualisation.
