  Essential oils ( EOs) , as substitutes for antibiotics in animal diets , should have a selective antibacterial activity between pathogenic and beneficial bacteria from animal gut. Thus , this study evaluated the selective antibacterial activity of <i> E. globulus </i> ( EG) and <i> P. pseudocaryophyllus </i> ( PP) EOs on <i> Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> </i> as surrogate model of pathogenic bacterium<pathogen> , and <i> Lactobacillus<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> </i> as beneficial bacterium<pathogen> model. The EOs antibacterial activity was evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs) , minimal bactericidal concentration ( MBCs) and fractional inhibitory concentration ( FIC) index determinations. The time-kill and sequential exposure assays were also performed , but using only the EG oil , which was the best selective EO , since it had a MIC lower on <i> E faecalis </i> ( 7.4 mg/mL) than on <i> L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> </i> ( 14.8 mg/mL). FIC index values showed that the combination of two EOs had an indifferent effect ( 1.25 and 2.03) on <i> E faecalis </i> and an additive effect ( 1.00) on <i> L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> </i>. The time-kill assay showed that EG oil was able to kill <i> E faecalis </i> within 15 min of treatment ( ~ 5Log of reduction) and caused a reduction ~ 3Log of <i> L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> </i> viability. The sequential exposure assay showed that EG oil ( at MIC/2) produced higher reduction on <i> E faecalis </i> viability ( ~ 3Log) than on <i> L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> </i> ( ~ 2Log) as well. Therefore , <i> L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> </i> presented higher tolerance to antibacterial activity of EG oil than <i> E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> </i>.
