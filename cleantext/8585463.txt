  Intramuscular pressure ( IMP) is the fluid pressure generated within skeletal muscle and directly reflects individual muscle tension. The purpose of this study was to assess the development of force , IMP , and electromyography ( EMG) in the tibialis anterior ( TA) muscle during ramped isometric contractions and evaluate electromechanical delay ( EMD). Force , EMG , and IMP were simultaneously measured during ramped isometric contractions in eight young , healthy human subjects. The EMD between the onset of force and EMG activity ( Δt-EMG force) and the onset of IMP and EMG activity ( Δt EMG-IMP) were calculated. A statistically significant difference ( p < 0.05) was found between the mean force-EMG EMD ( 36 ± 31 ms) and the mean IMP-EMG EMD ( 3 ± 21 ms). IMP reflects changes in muscle tension due to the contractile muscle elements.
