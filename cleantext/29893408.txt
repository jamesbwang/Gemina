  Oxidative stress and low grade chronic inflammation<symptom> stand out as key features of physiological skin aging. The aim of this study was to examine in normal human epidermal keratinocytes ( NHEK) and human dermal fibroblasts ( HDF) grown in vitro , the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of crocin , a carotenoid glycoside responsible for the color of saffron. Moreover , considering the newly emerging field of skin glycobiology and the presence of two gentiobiosyl moieties in crocin , the effect of crocin on NHEK glycosylation pathways was for the first time investigated. The anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities of crocin were evaluated by in vitro assays of anti-oxidation activities , Elisa assays and microarray analysis. The effect of crocin on keratinocyte glycobiology was evaluated by proprietary GLYcoDiag lectin technologies and microarray analysis. Crocin is endowed with antioxidant potential against ROS , protects squalene against UVA-induced peroxidation and prevents the release of inflammatory mediators. The expression of NF-kB related genes and glycosylation related genes is modulated in the presence of crocin. Results could designate this molecule as a promising skin aging prevention cosmetic agent. Of note , some of these effects could be mediated by protein O-glycosylation and interaction of crocin with osidic receptors of keratinocytes. This article is protected by copyright.
