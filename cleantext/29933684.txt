  Urinary metabolomics combined with histological progression were utilized to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Scutellariae Radix decoction and baicalin on hepatic fibrosis<disease> ( HF) and explore their mechanisms , intervention targets and metabolic pathways. HF rat model was established through subcutaneous injection of CCl â‚„ for 8 weeks. Meanwhile , different doses of Scutellariae Radix decoction and baicalin were administered. Histomorphology of liver tissue was observed and scored by HE and Masson. Urinary metabonomic analysis based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS was made for the changes of urinary potential biomarkers among different groups at different time points of HF. Finally , it was found that Scutellariae Radix decoction could improve HF by regulating L-tryptophan , 3-methyldioxyindole , 5-hydroxyindoleacetylglycine , kynurenic acid , 4- ( 2-amino-3-hydroxyphenyl) -2,4-dioxobutanoic acid , methylmalonic acid and L-leucine. However , baicalin could improve HF by regulating L-tryptophan , 3-methyldioxyindole , 5-hydroxyindoleacetylglycine , 4- ( 2-amino-3-hydroxyphenyl) -2,4-dioxobutanoic acid , kynurenic acid , and methylmalonic acid. These metabolites involved in tryptophan metabolism and valine , leucine and isoleucine degradation pathways. These results indicated that Scutellariae Radix had the multi-target and multi-pathway characteristics in the treatment of HF. Additionally , low-dose Scutellariae Radix decoction and baicalin are showed better efficacies , with no statistically significant difference between them in histomorphology.
