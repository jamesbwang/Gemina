  Benzene polycarboxylic acid ( BPCA) molecules are a widely used marker method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of pyrogenic black carbons ( BC). Based on an overview of the development and chemical reaction mechanism of the BPCA method , we propose that the commonly used BPCA markers may not be solely indicative of BC but more generally of condensed organic matter in soils and aquatic systems. First , we sequentially removed the soil fractions and observed that the BPCA contents were abundant in humic acids ( HAs). After sequential treatment , the residual particles were supposed to contain BC and minerals; however , the BPCAs in the residue accounted for only 2.4-10.1 % of that detected in the entire soil. In addition , substantial quantities of BPCAs were detected in both thermally treated samples and composted biomass. Furthermore , humic acids extracted from all the samples showed that obvious BPCA contents in the samples accounted for 0.1-121.7 mg/g. Therefore , soil fractionation may also partly extract BCs as suggested by BPCAs in the HAs of the biochars. However , organic matter without any thermal treatment may contain BPCAs. A series of standard substances without any BC showed high BPCA content in the samples from 5.9-124.5 mg/g. These observations create a serious concern for the proper application of BPCAs as a marker for BCs. Combining a systematic literature review of BPCA that deviates from BC content , we suggest that the BC-like structure of organic matter may be referred to as BPCA-probed organic matter content , which could be a more useful term for studies on the multimedia environmental behaviors of contaminants.
