  The literature on revision anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) reconstruction ( ACLR) outcomes is generally sparse , but previous studies have demonstrated that autograft use results in improved sports function and patient-reported outcome measures compared with allograft. However , knowledge is still lacking regarding the impact of graft type on rates of re-revision. To investigate the clinical outcomes and failure rates of revision ACLRs performed with either allograft or autograft. Cohort study; Level of evidence , 3. A search of the Danish Knee Ligament Reconstruction Registry identified 1619 revision ACLRs: 1315 were autograft procedures and 221 were allograft procedures ( type of graft was not identified for 83 procedures). Clinical outcomes after 1 year were reported via the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS) , the Tegner activity score , and an objective knee stability measurement that determined side-to-side differences in instrumented sagittal knee laxity. Failure was determined as re-revision. Outcomes for revision were provided for the full life of the registry , up to 10 years. The re-revision rate was significantly higher for allograft compared with autograft ( 12.7 % vs 5.4 %; In this observational population-based study , the ALCR re-revision rate was 2.2 times greater for allograft compared with autograft procedures. Allograft was associated with greater knee laxity at 1-year follow-up. However , subjective clinical outcomes and knee function were not inferior for allograft patients. These results indicate that autograft is a better graft choice for revision ALCR.
