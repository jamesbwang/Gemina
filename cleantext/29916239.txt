  Carapax Trionycis ( the shell of the turtle Pelodiscus sinensis<pathogen>) was hydrolyzed by six different commercial proteases. The hydrolysate prepared from papain showed stronger inhibitory activity against angiotensin I-converting enzyme ( ACE) than other extracts. Two noncompetitive ACE inhibitory peptides were purified successively by ultrafiltration , gel filtration chromatography , ion exchange column chromatography , and high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). The amino acid sequences of them were identified as KRER and LHMFK , with IC
