  Nucleosome not only directly affects cellular processes , such as DNA replication , recombination , and transcription , but also severs as a fundamentally important target of epigenetic modifications. Our previous study indicated that the bending property of DNA is important in nucleosome formation , particularly in predicting the dyad positions of nucleosomes on a DNA segment. Here , we investigated the role of bending energy in nucleosome positioning and sliding in depth to decipher sequence-directed mechanism. The results show that bending energy is a good physical index to predict the free energy in the process of nucleosome reconstitution in vitro. Our data also imply that there are at least 20 % of the nucleosomes in budding yeast do not adopt canonical positioning , in which underlying sequences wrapped around histones are structurally symmetric. We also revealed distinct patterns of bending energy profile for distinctly organized chromatin structures , such as well-positioned nucleosomes , fuzzy nucleosomes , and linker regions and discussed nucleosome sliding in terms of bending energy. We proposed that the stability of a nucleosome is positively correlated with the strength of the bending anisotropy of DNA segment , and both accessibility and directionality of nucleosome sliding is likely to be modulated by diverse patterns of DNA bending energy profile.
