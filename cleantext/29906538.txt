  The anterior pituitary regulates endocrine organs and physiological activities in the body. Environmental pollutants and drugs deleterious to the endocrine system may affect anterior pituitary activity through direct action on anterior pituitary cells. Within the gland , endocrine and folliculostellate cells are organized into and function as individual tridimensional networks , each network regulating its activity by coordinating the connected cells ' responses to physiological or pathological cues. The gap junctions connecting endocrine cells and/or folliculostellate cells allow transmission of information among cells that is necessary for adequate network function. Toxicants may affect gap junctions as well as the physiology of the anterior pituitary. However , whether toxicants effects on anterior pituitary hormone secretion involve gap junctions is unknown. The folliculostellate cell gap junctions are sensitive to hormones , cytokines and growth factors. These cells may be an interesting experimental model for evaluating whether toxicants target anterior pituitary gap junctions.
