  Severe pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> ( STB) is a life‑threatening condition with high economic and social burden. The present study aimed to screen for distinct proteins in different stages of TB and identify biomarkers for a better understanding of TB progression and pathogenesis. Blood samples were obtained from 81 patients with STB , 80 with mild TB ( MTB) and 50 healthy controls. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using liquid chromatography‑tandem mass spectrometry‑based label‑free quantitative proteomic analysis. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the identified proteins. The expression of potential biomarkers was further validated by western blot analysis and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assays. The accuracy , sensitivity and specificity for selected protein biomarkers in diagnosing STB were also evaluated. A total of 1,011 proteins were identified in all three groups , and 153 differentially expressed proteins were identified in patients with STB. These proteins were involved in ` cellular process ' , ` response to stimulus ' , ` apoptotic process ' , ` immune system process ' and ` select metabolic process '. Significant differences in protein expression were detected in α‑1‑acid glycoprotein 2 ( ORM2) , interleukin‑36α ( IL‑36α) , S100 calcium binding protein A9 ( S100‑A9) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) 1 in the STB group , compared with the MTB and control groups. The combination of plasma ORM2 , IL‑36α , S100A9 and SOD1 levels achieved 90.00 % sensitivity and 92.16 % specificity to discriminate between patients with STB and MTB , and 89.66 % sensitivity and 98.9 % specificity to discriminate between patients with STB and healthy controls. ORM2 , S100A9 , IL‑36α and SOD1 were associated with the development of TB , and have the potential to distinguish between different stages of TB. Differential protein expression during disease progression may improve the current understanding of STB pathogenesis.
