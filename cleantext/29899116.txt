  Neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim ( PAS) domain-containing protein 4 ( NPAS4) is a basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH)- PAS transcription factor first discovered in neurons in the neuronal layer of the mammalian hippocampus and later discovered in pancreatic Î²-cells. NPAS4 has been proposed as a therapeutic target not only for depression<symptom> and neurodegenerative diseases associated with synaptic dysfunction but also for type 2 diabetes and pancreas transplantation. The ability of bHLH-PAS proteins to fulfil their function depends on their intracellular trafficking , which is regulated by specific sequences ,
