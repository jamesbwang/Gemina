  Research has demonstrated that values and acceptance interventions can increase distress tolerance , but the individual contribution of each remains unclear. The current study examined the isolated effect of a values intervention on immersion time in a cold pressor. Participants randomized to Values ( n = 18) and Control ( n = 14) conditions completed two cold pressor tasks , separated by a 30-min values or control intervention. Immersion time increased 51.06 s for participants in the Values condition and decreased by 10.79 s for those in the Control condition. Increases in self-reported pain and distress predicted decreases in immersion time for Control , but not Values , participants. The best-fitting model accounted for 39 % of the variance in immersion time change. Results suggest that a brief isolated values exercise can be used to improve distress tolerance despite increased perceptions of pain and distress , such that values alone may be sufficient to facilitate openness to difficult experiences.
