  The second-generation ALK inhibitor alectinib recently demonstrated superior efficacy compared to the first-generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib in advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK)- rearranged non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , establishing alectinib as the new standard first-line therapy. Brigatinib , another second-generation ALK inhibitor , has demonstrated substantial activity in patients with crizotinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC; however , its activity in the alectinib-refractory setting is unknown. A multicenter , retrospective study was performed at three institutions. Patients were eligible if they had advanced , alectinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC and were treated with brigatinib. Medical records were reviewed to determine clinical outcomes. Twenty-two patients were eligible for this study. Confirmed objective responses to brigatinib were observed in 3 of 18 patients ( 17 %) with measurable disease. Nine patients ( 50 %) had stable disease on brigatinib. The median progression-free survival was 4.4 months ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.8-5.6 months) with a median duration of treatment of 5.7 months ( 95 % CI , 1.8-6.2 months). Among nine patients in this study who underwent post-alectinib/pre-brigatinib biopsies , five had an ALK I1171X or V1180L resistance mutation; of these , one had a confirmed partial response and three had stable disease on brigatinib. One patient had an ALK G1202R mutation in a post-alectinib/pre-brigatinib biopsy , and had progressive disease as the best overall response to brigatinib. Brigatinib has limited clinical activity in alectinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC. Additional studies are needed to establish biomarkers of response to brigatinib and to identify effective therapeutic options for alectinib-resistant ALK-positive NSCLC patients.
