  Accumulating studies have demonstrated that Kr√ºppel-like factor 4 ( KLF4) can act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in the carcinogenesis of diverse cancers. The prognostic value of KLF4 in various human solid cancers remains controversial. Thus , the present meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of KLF4 in solid tumors. Eligible literature was retrieved by searching the PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane Library. Combined hazard ratios ( HRs) for overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS) were assessed using fixed-effects and random-effects models. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. In addition , publication bias was assessed using Begg 's funnel plot and Egger 's regression asymmetry test. The 22 eligible studies finally enrolled a total of 2988 patients to assess the prognostic value of KLF4 in solid tumors. Low KLF4 expression was clearly related to worse OS ( HR = 1.71 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.30-2.24 , P < 0.001) and DFS ( HR = 1.74 , 95 % CI = 1.34-2.26 , P < 0.001) , indicating that low KLF4 expression could be an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in solid cancers. KLF4 might be a potential marker to predict prognosis in solid cancer patients.
