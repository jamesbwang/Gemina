  Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) is characterized by the development of paradoxical memory disturbances including intrusive memories and amnesia for specific details of the traumatic experience. Despite evidence that women are at higher risk to develop PTSD , most animal research has focused on the processes by which male rodents develop adaptive fear memory. As such , the mechanisms contributing to sex differences in the development of PTSD-like memory disturbances are poorly understood. In this investigation , we exposed adult male and female Wistar rats to the synthetic alarm odor 2,4,5-trimethylthiazole ( TMT) to assess development of generalized fear behavior and rapid modulation of glutamate uptake and signaling cascades associated with hippocampus-dependent long-term memory. We report that female Wistar rats exposed to alarm odor exhibit context discrimination impairments relative to TMT-exposed male rats , suggesting the intriguing possibility that females are at greater risk in developing generalized fear memories. Mechanistically , alarm odor exposure rapidly modulated signaling cascades consistent with activation of the CREB shut-off cascade in the male , but not the female hippocampus. Moreover , TMT exposure dampened glutamate uptake and affected expression of the glutamate transporter , GLT-1 in the hippocampus. Taken together , these results provide evidence for rapid sex-dependent modulation of CREB signaling in the hippocampus by alarm odor exposure which may contribute to the development of generalized fear.
