  Research suggests that cognition-emotion interactions change with age. In the present study , younger and older adults completed a 2-back task , and the effects of negative stimuli were analyzed as a function of their status in the n-back sequence. Older adults were found to benefit more from angry than from neutral probes relative to younger adults. However , they were slower when lures were angry and less accurate when lures and probes had the same emotion. The results suggest that recollection of the n-back sequence was reduced in older adults , making them more susceptible to the facilitating and impairing effects of negative emotion.
