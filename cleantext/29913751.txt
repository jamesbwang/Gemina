  Introduction and aim Pain is a frequent symptom in emergency patients and opioids are commonly used to treat it at emergency departments and at pre-hospital settings. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the efficacy and safety of parenteral opioids used for acute<symptom> pain<symptom> in emergency medicine. Method Qualitative review of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) on parenteral opioids for acute<symptom> pain<symptom> in adult emergency patients. Main outcome measures were: type and dose of the opioid , analgesic efficacy as compared to either placebo or another opioid and adverse effects. Results Twenty double-blind RCTs with results on 2322 patients were included. Seven studies were placebo controlled. Majority of studies were performed in the emergency department. Only five studies were in prehospital setting. Prehospital studies Four studies were on mainly trauma-related pain , one ischemic chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. One study compared two different doses of morphine in mainly trauma pain showing faster analgesia with the larger dose but no difference at 30 min postdrug. Three other studies on the same pain model showed equal analgesic effects with morphine and other opioids. Alfentanil was more effective than morphine in ischemic chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. Emergency department studies Pain models used were acute<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> seven , renal colic four , mixed ( mainly abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> three and trauma pain one study. Five studies compared morphine to placebo in acute<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and in all studies morphine was more effective than placebo. In four out of five studies on acute<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> morphine did not change diagnostic accuracy , clinical or radiological findings. Most commonly used morphine dose in the emergency department was 0.1 mg/kg ( five studies). Other opioids showed analgesic effect comparable to morphine. Adverse effects Recording and reporting of adverse effects was very variable. Vital signs were recorded in 15 of the 20 studies ( including all prehospital studies). Incidence of adverse effects in the opioid groups was 5-38 % of the patients in the prehospital setting and 4-46 % of the patients in the emergency department. Nausea<symptom> or vomiting<symptom> was reported in 11-25 % of the patients given opioids. Study drug was discontinued because of adverse effects five patients ( one placebo , two sufentanil , two morphine). Eight studies commented on administration of naloxone for reversal of opioid effects. One patient out of 1266 was given naloxone for drowsiness<symptom>. Ventilatory depression<symptom> defined by variable criteria occurred in occurred in 7 out of 756 emergency department patients. Conclusion Evidence for selection of optimal opioid and dose is scarce. Opioids , especially morphine , are effective in relieving acute<symptom> pain<symptom> also in emergency medicine patients. Studies so far are small and reporting of adverse effects is very variable. Therefore the safety of different opioids and doses remains to be studied. Also the optimal titration regimens need to be evaluated in future studies. The prevention and treatment of opioid-induced nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> is an important clinical consideration that requires further clinical and scientific attention in this patient group.
