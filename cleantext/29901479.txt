  A 22-year-old man sustained a laceration that measured 180 cm , after debridement , over the anterolateral aspect of the right leg following a road traffic accident. The wound<disease> was treated with MyDerm ( Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia) , a cell-based , bilayered , bioengineered dermal substitute that contains no animal-derived components and is fully autologous. For its construction , only a small area of skin was harvested from the left groin , which was closed primarily with absorbable sutures. MyDerm is an alternative option for the treatment of a massive skin defect in patients who desire removal of only a negligible amount of skin from the donor site and when use of an autograft is insufficient.
