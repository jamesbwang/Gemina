  Patients with cranioplasty in need of skull reconstruction are at increased risk of complications when presenting with abnormally thin scalps. As such , the authors sought to develop and investigate a new technique for scalp augmentation using autologous rectus<pathogen> fascia grafts ( ARFGs) for prevention of implant extrusion and long-term scalp durability. A retrospective review of our database , consisting of 450 consecutive cranial reconstructions from 2012 to 2017 , was performed under institutional review board approval. Selection criteria included all adult patients requiring implant-based cranioplasty reconstruction and concomitant scalp augmentation using ARFGs. All long-term outcomes were reviewed for scalp-related complications and are presented here. In total , 12 consecutive patients receiving ARFGs were identified. Average follow-up was 10 months ( range = 2-17 months). Average graft size and dimension was 82 cm ( range = 12-360 cm). All patients ( n = 12) underwent concomitant cranioplasty reconstruction and had a history of at least 5 or greater previous neurocranial operations. Six patients had radiation therapy prior to cranioplasty. Two major complications ( 2/12 , 17 %) were identified related to deep , recurrent intracranial infections. More importantly , none of the patients ( n = 12) in this study cohort developed scalp breakdown and/or implant extrusion in the areas of rectus<pathogen> fascia scalp augmentation. The use of ARFGs for underlay scalp augmentation appears to be both safe and reliable based on our preliminary experience. This new approach is extremely valuable when performing large-size cranioplasty reconstruction in patients with abnormally thin scalps , an extensive neurosurgical history , and/or suboptimal tissue quality. Furthermore , this method has been successful in avoiding free tissue transfer and/or staged tissue expansion as first-line surgery in our complicated cranioplasty population.
