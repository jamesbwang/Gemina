  Our study aimed to assess whether the type of regional anesthesia influenced the incidence of chronic postthoracotomy pain syndrome<disease> ( CPTPS). This was a prospective , randomized study that included 300 patients undergoing lung cancer resection using thoracotomy. They were randomized into three groups: paravertebral nerve block ( PVB) , thoracic epidural anesthesia ( TEA) , and intercostal nerve block ( INB). General anesthesia was similar in the groups. A horizontal visual analogue scale ( VAS) was used to assess the intensity of the pain syndrome<disease>. It was assessed and recorded 7 days , 1 month , and 6 months after surgery. At 6 months after surgery , the incidence ( p < 0.05) of the CPTPS was higher in the INB group ( 40 %) than in the TEA group ( 23 %). The CPTPS frequency in the PVB group did not differ from the other groups ( 34 %). The use of the TEA in patients who underwent open lung cancer surgery contributed to a significant decline in the CPTPS frequency compared to patients who were administered INB. Using PVB did not decrease the CPTPS frequency.
