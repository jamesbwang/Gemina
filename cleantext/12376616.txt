  Accumulating evidence suggests that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl plays an important role in the progression of Parkinson 's disease ( PD) and c-Abl inhibition could be neuroprotective in PD and related α-synucleinopathies. Nilotinib , a c-Abl inhibitor , has shown improved motor and cognitive symptoms in PD patients. However , issues concerning blood-brain barrier ( BBB) penetration , lack of selectivity and safety still remain. Radotinib HCl is a selective Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor that not only effectively access the brain , but also exhibits greater pharmacokinetic properties and safety profiles compared to Nilotinib and other c-Abl inhibitors. Here , we show the neuroprotective efficacy of Radotinib HCl , a brain penetrant c-Abl inhibitor , in a pre-clinical model of PD. Importantly , in vitro studies demonstrate that the treatment of Radotinib HCl protects the α-synuclein preformed fibrils ( PFF)- induced neuronal toxicity , reduces the α-synuclein PFF-induced Lewy bodies ( LB)/ Lewy neurites ( LN)- like pathology and inhibits the α-synuclein PFF-induced c-Abl activation in primary cortical neurons. Furthermore , administration of Radotinib HCl inhibits c-Abl activation and prevents dopaminergic neuron loss , neuroinflammation and behavioral deficits following α-synuclein PFF-induced toxicity in vivo. Taken together , our findings indicate that Radotinib HCl has beneficial neuroprotective effects in PD and provides an evidence that selective and brain permeable c-Abl inhibitors can be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.
