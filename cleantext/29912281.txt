  Little attention has been given to the design of efficient studies to evaluate longitudinal biomarkers. Measuring longitudinal markers on an entire cohort is cost prohibitive and , especially for rare outcomes such as cancer , may be infeasible. Thus , methods for evaluation of longitudinal biomarkers using efficient and cost-effective study designs are needed. Case cohort ( CCH) and nested case-control ( NCC) studies allow investigators to evaluate biomarkers rigorously and at reduced cost , with only a small loss in precision. In this article , we develop estimators of several measures to evaluate the accuracy and discrimination of predicted risk under CCH and NCC study designs. We use double inverse probability weighting ( DIPW) to account for censoring and sampling bias in estimation and inference procedures. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators. To facilitate inference using two-phase longitudinal data , we develop valid resampling-based variance estimation procedures under CCH and NCC. We evaluate the performance of our estimators under CCH and NCC using simulation studies and illustrate them on a NCC study within the hepatitis<disease> C<disease> antiviral long-term treatment against cirrhosis ( HALT-C) clinical trial. Our estimators and inference procedures perform well under CCH and NCC , provided that the sample size at the time of prediction ( effective sample size) is reasonable. These methods are widely applicable , efficient , and cost-effective and can be easily adapted to other study designs used to evaluate prediction rules in a longitudinal setting.
