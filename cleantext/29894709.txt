  Tumor hypoxia strikingly restricts photodynamic therapy ( PDT) efficacy and limits its clinical applications in cancer therapy. The ideal strategy to address this issue is to develop oxygen-independent PDT systems. Herein , the rationally designed tumor pH-responsive polymeric micelles are devised to realize oxygen-independent combined PDT and photothermal therapy ( PTT) under near-infrared light ( NIR) irradiation. The triblock copolymer , poly ( ethylene glycol)- b-poly ( Îµ-caprolactone)- b-poly ( 2- ( piperidin-1-yl) ethyl methacrylate) ( PEG-b-PCL-b- PPEMA) , was prepared to co-encapsulate cypate and singlet oxygen donor ( diphenylanthracene endoperoxide , DPAE) via self-assembly to obtain the micellar delivery system ( C/O @N- Micelle). C/O @N- Micelle showed remarkable tumor accumulation and improved cellular internalization ( 2.1 times) as the pH value was changed from 7.4 during blood circulation to 6.8 in tumor tissues. The micelles could produce a potent hyperthermia<symptom> for PTT of cypate under 808 nm NIR irradiation , which simultaneously induced thermal cycloreversion of DPAE generating abundant singlet oxygen for PDT without participation of tumor oxygen. Finally , the photothermally triggered PDT and PTT combination achieved efficient tumor ablation without remarkable systemic toxicity in an oxygen-independent manner. This work represents an efficient strategy for oxygen-independent combined PDT and PTT of cancers under NIR irradiation through co-encapsulation of cypate and DPAE into tumor pH-responsive polymeric micelles.
