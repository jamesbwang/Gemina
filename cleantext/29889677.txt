  Giant cell myocarditis<disease> ( GCM) is a rare and a rapidly progressive disorder with fatal outcomes such that patients often require heart transplantation. We present a case of recurrent GCM in a transplanted patient with a history of Crohn disease requiring a novel therapeutic approach. After the orthotopic heart transplantation , GCM recurred on aggressive immunosuppression over the months , which included corticosteroids , basiliximab , tacrolimus , antithymocyte globulin , and rituximab. Although combination immunosuppressive therapy containing cyclosporine and 2-4 additional drugs including corticosteroids , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , muromonab , gammaglobulin , or methotrexate have shown to prolong the transplant-free survival by keeping the disease under control , its role in preventing and treating recurrence posttransplantation is unclear. We added sirolimus , a macrolide antibiotic , with properties of T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation inhibition on the above immunosuppressive treatment postrecurrence of GCM. After sirolimus initiation and continuation , the patient has remained disease free.
