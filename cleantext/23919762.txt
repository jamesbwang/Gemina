  Donor-specific antibodies ( DSA) to human leukocyte antigen increase the risk of accelerated rejection and allograft damage and reduce the likelihood of successful transplantation. Patients with full-thickness facial burns may benefit from facial allotransplantation. However , they are at a high risk of developing DSA due to standard features of their acute care. A 41-year-old male with severe disfigurement from facial burns consented to facial allotransplantation in 2014; panel reactive antibody score was 0 %. In August of 2015 , a suitable donor was found. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch was negative; flow cytometry crossmatch was positive to donor B cells. An induction immunosuppression strategy consisting of rabbit antithymocyte globulin , rituximab , tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF) , and methylprednisolone taper was designed. Total face , scalp , eyelid , ears<disease> , and skeletal subunit allotransplantation was performed without operative , immunological , or infectious complications. Maintenance immunosuppression consists of tacrolimus , MMF , and prednisone. As of posttransplant month 24 , the patient has not developed acute rejection or metabolic or infectious complications. To our knowledge , this is the first report of targeted B cell agents used for induction immunosuppression in skin-containing vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation. A cautious approach is warranted , but early results are promising for reconstructive transplant candidates given the exceptionally high rate of acute rejection episodes , particularly in the first year , in this patient population.
