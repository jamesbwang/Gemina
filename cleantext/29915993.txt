  We assessed the effects of subcutaneous-endovenous fentanyl on dyspnoea in a cohort of advanced cancer patients. We performed a retrospective study in a cohort of advanced cancer patients with dyspnoea at rest who received subcutaneous or intravenous fentanyl. Patients with no shortness of breath at rest or at minimal exertion , no rescue doses per 24 h , were deemed to be responders to fentanyl. The period of assessment was 6 days from the beginning of fentanyl treatment. Seventy-two patients were evaluated: 65 % males , 50 % ≥ 75 years , Palliative Performance Scale ( PPS) median of 30 %. Seventy-six percent of the patients were responders to fentanyl. Fentanyl efficacy was not statistically related to age , gender , cancer type , previous opioid treatment , steroid and midazolam doses and PPS. The median fentanyl dose in responders was 25 mcg/h ( interquartile range 12-70). It was significantly related to age ( 37 vs 12 mcg/h , for ≤ 75 vs > 75 years , respectively; p = 0.02). There was not a significant difference between fentanyl doses of responders and non-responder patients. Thirty-six , 23 and 15 patients had sustained improvements in dyspnoea over 48 , 72 and 96 h. Fentanyl had no significant toxicity. The length of inclusion in the study and exclusion were related to low performance status ( hazard ratio 0.961; Our preliminary data suggest that subcutaneous-endovenous fentanyl may be associated with dyspnoea relief in dying patients. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.
