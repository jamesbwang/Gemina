  Image registration involves identification of a transformation to fit a target image to a reference image space. The success of the registration process is vital for correct interpretation of the results of many medical image-processing applications , including multi-atlas segmentation. While there are several validation metrics employed in rigid registration to examine the accuracy of the method , non-rigid registrations ( NRR) are validated subjectively in most cases , validated in offline cases , or based on image similarity metrics , all of which have been shown to poorly correlate with true registration quality. In this paper , we model the error for each target scan by expanding on the idea of Assessing Quality Using Image Registration Circuits ( AQUIRC) , which created a model for error `` quality '' associated with NRR. In this paper , we model the Dice similarity coefficient ( DSC) error in the network , for a more interpretable measure. We test four functional models using a leave-one-out strategy to evaluate the relationship between edge DSC and circuit DSC: linear , quadratic , third order , or multiplicative models. We found that the quadratic model most accurately learns the NRR-DSC , with a median correlation coefficient of 0.58 with the true NRR-DSC , we call this the QUADRATIC ( QUAlity of Dice in RegistrATIon Circuits) model. The QUADRATIC model is used for multi-atlas segmentation based on majority vote. Choosing the four best atlases predicted from the QUDRATIC model resulted in a 7 % increase in the DSC between segmented image and true labels.
