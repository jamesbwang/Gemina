  To evaluate how the interval between radiation and salvage surgery for advanced laryngeal cancer with free tissue transfer reconstruction influences complication rates. This is a retrospective series of 26 patients who underwent salvage laryngectomy or laryngopharyngectomy with vascularized free tissue reconstruction ( anterolateral thigh or radial forearm) following radiation or chemoradiation between 2012 and 2017 at a single academic center. The primary outcome was incidence of postoperative complications , including pharyngocutaneous fistula<disease>. Secondary outcomes included the need for a second procedure , time to resumption of oral feeding , feeding tube dependence , and hospital length of stay. Salvage surgery was performed for persistence ( 7/26 , 27 %) , recurrence/new primary ( 12/26 , 46 %) , and dysfunctional larynges ( 7/26 , 27 %). Twenty-two ( 85 %) defects were reconstructed with an anterolateral thigh free flap and 4/26 with a radial forearm free flap ( 15 %). There were no flap failures. There were significantly more complications in patients undergoing surgery within 12 months of completion of radiation therapy ( 7/12 , 58 %) versus those undergoing surgery after 12 months ( 1/14 , 7 %; p = .02). Patients experiencing complications more often required a second procedure ( 4/7 vs. 0/1; p = .02) , experienced a longer delay to initiation of oral diet ( 61 vs. 21 days; p = .04) , and stayed in the hospital longer ( 28 vs. 9 days; p = .01). Shorter intervals between definitive radiation and salvage laryngopharyngeal surgery with free tissue reconstruction increases postoperative complications , hospital length of stay , and the likelihood of feeding tube dependence. Reconstructive surgeons can use these findings to help guide preoperative patient counseling and assess postoperative risk.
