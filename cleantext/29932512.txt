  Since 2012 , lumpy skin disease<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( LSDV) has been spreading from the Middle<pathogen> East to south-east Europe and Russia. Although vaccination campaigns have managed to contain LSDV outbreaks , the risk of further spread is still high. The most likely route of LSDV transmission in short distance spread is vector-borne. Several arthropod species have been suggested as potential vectors , but no proven vector has yet been identified. To check whether promiscuous-landing synanthropic flies such as the common housefly ( Musca domestica) could be involved , we carried out entomological trapping at the site of a recent LSDV outbreak caused by a vaccine-like LSDV strain. The presence of vaccine-like LSDV DNA was confirmed by the assay developed herein , the assay by Agianniotaki et al. ( 2017) and RPO30 gene sequencing. No evidence of field LSDV strain circulation was revealed. In this study , we discovered that M. domestica flies carried vaccine-like LSDV DNA ( C
