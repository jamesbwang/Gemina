  Innate immunity in land plants mostly relies on a repertoire of NLR ( nucleotide-binding , leucine-rich repeat) receptors. Gao et al. show that evolutionary assembly of the core building blocks of NLRs occurred in the ancestors of early plants and trace the diversification of NLR subclasses in green algae<pathogen> and mosses.
