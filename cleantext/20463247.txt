  Ibrutinib , a Bruton 's tyrosine kinase inhibitor , has been increasingly widely used in relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( 1 , 2). With its use becoming more common , there have been emerging case reports of opportunistic infections like cryptococcal infections ( 3-8). These infections in patients receiving ibrutinib were mostly reported in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia , who have poor immune reconstitution. Here , we report two cases of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis<disease> in patients with MCL on ibrutinib.
