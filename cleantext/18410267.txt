  Despite complex olfactory bulb embryogenesis , its development abnormalities in tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC) have been poorly investigated. Brain MRIs of 110 TSC patients ( mean age 11.5 years; age range 0.5-38 years; 52 female; 26 TSC1 , 68 TSC2 , 8 without mutation identified in TSC1 or TSC2 , 8 not tested) were retrospectively evaluated. Signal and morphological abnormalities consistent with olfactory bulb hypo/aplasia or with olfactory bulb hamartomas were recorded. Cortical tuber number was visually assessed and a neurological severity score was obtained. Patients with and without rhinencephalon abnormalities were compared using appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests. Eight of110 ( 7.2 %) TSC patients presented rhinencephalon MRI changes encompassing olfactory bulb bilateral aplasia ( 2/110) , bilateral hypoplasia ( 2/110) , unilateral hypoplasia ( 1/110) , unilateral hamartoma ( 2/110) , and bilateral hamartomas ( 1/110); olfactory bulb hypo/aplasia always displayed ipsilateral olfactory sulcus hypoplasia , while no TSC patient harboring rhinencephalon hamartomas had concomitant forebrain sulcation abnormalities. None of the patients showed overt olfactory deficits or hypogonadism , though young age and poor compliance hampered a proper evaluation in most cases. TSC patients with rhinencephalon changes had more cortical tubers ( 47 ± 29.1 vs 26.2 ± 19.6; p = 0.006) but did not differ for clinical severity ( p = 0.45) compared to the other patients of the sample. Olfactory bulb and/or forebrain changes are not rare among TSC subjects. Future studies investigating clinical consequences in older subjects ( anosmia , gonadic development etc.) will define whether rhinencephalon changes are simply an imaging feature among the constellation of TSC-related brain changes or a feature to be searched for possible implications in the management of TSC subjects.
