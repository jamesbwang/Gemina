  The removal of Direct Blue 71 ( DB71) , by laccase ( EC 1.10.3.2 , p-bezenediol: dioxygen oxidoreductases) enzyme in presence of 2,2 '- Azinobis- ( 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) ( ABTS) , in aqueous solution was investigated. Data on this article focused on the optimizing and modeling of DB71 removal by Response surface method ( RSM) based on Box-Behnken design ( BBD) , through studying the effective variables as follows: ABTS dose ( 0.05-0.2 mM) , Laccase dose ( 0.05-0.2 U mL
