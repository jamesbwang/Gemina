  In oriental medicine , curcumin is used to treat inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> , and its anti-inflammatory effect has been reported in recent research. In this feasibility study , the hepatoprotective effect of curcumin was investigated using a rat liver cirrhosis model , which was induced with dimethylnitrosamine ( DMN). Together with biochemical analysis , we used a magnetic resonance-based electrical conductivity imaging method to evaluate tissue conditions associated with a protective effect. The effects of curcumin treatment and lactulose treatment on liver cirrhosis were compared. Electrical conductivity images indicated that liver tissues damaged by DMN showed decreased conductivity compared with normal liver tissues. In contrast , cirrhotic liver tissues treated with curcumin or lactulose showed increased conductivity than tissues in the DMN-only group. Specifically , conductivity of cirrhotic liver after curcumin treatment was similar to that of normal liver tissues. Histological staining and immunohistochemical examination showed significant levels of attenuated fibrosis<disease> and decreased inflammatory response after both curcumin and lactulose treatments compared with damaged liver tissues by DMN. The conductivity imaging and biochemical examination results indicate that curcumin 's anti-inflammatory effect can prevent the progression of irreversible liver dysfunction.
