  A series of pyridine-linked indanone derivatives were designed and synthesized to discover new small molecules for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD). Compounds 5b and 5d exhibited strongest inhibitory activity against TNF-α-induced monocyte adhesion to colon epithelial cells ( an in vitro model of colitis<disease>). In TNBS ( 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid)- induced rat colitis<disease> model , oral administration of the compounds 5b and 5d ameliorated colitis<disease> with significant recovery in altered expressions of E-cadherin , TNF-α and IL-1β expressions , indicating 5b and 5d as potential agents for therapeutics development against IBD.
