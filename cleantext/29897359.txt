  Furan derivatives , potentially carcinogenic to humans , can be formed , in addition to carbohydrates and other sources , from the degradation of ascorbic acid ( AA). At present , the mechanisms involved in the ascorbic acid degradation are not yet fully understood. In this study , we reported a gas-phase investigation , performed using Triple Quadrupole ( TQ/MS) and Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry ( QIT/MS) together with quantum mechanical calculations at the B3LYP/6 -31 + G ( d , p) level of theory , on the non-oxidative degradation mechanism of l-ascorbic acid ( AA) to furan derivatives. Gaseous protonated ascorbic acid ions , the AAH + ionic reagents , were generated by Electrospray Ionization ( ESI) of an aqueous AA solution added with a mild protonation reagent. The Collisionally Induced Dissociation ( CID) mass spectra of the AAH + ions displayed gaseous fragment ions corresponding to the degradation intermediates and reaction products , which were structurally characterized and identified. Precise mechanistic insights were achieved by using l- ( 1-13C)- AA. On the basis of experimental and computational results , the gas phase non-oxidative acid catalyzed degradation mechanism of ascorbic acid is proposed , a benchmark point for the comprehension of the mechanism in the condensed phase.
