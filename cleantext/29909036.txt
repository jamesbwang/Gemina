  This paper aims to investigate chemical composition , rheological behavior , antioxidant activity and functional properties of Cordia myxa mucilage ( CMM). Response surface methodology ( RSM) demonstrated that optimum conditions for CMM extraction were as follow: ultrasound power of 99.37 W , extraction temperature of 88.05 Â°C and solid to water ratio of 16.25 w/w. CMM had , on average , 77.51 % carbohydrate , 5.86 % total ash , 8.90 % protein , 6.90 % moisture , and 1.00 % fat. Due to a high level of nutrients , CMM can be suggested as a value added by-product in food and pharmaceutical systems. CMM is a low molecular weight polysaccharide containing three fractions with various molecular weights. FT-IR spectrum illustrated that this polymer had all typical bands and peaks characteristics of polysaccharides. Based on steady shear measurements , CMM can be introduced as a new source of hydrocolloid with high-temperature stability. CMM had the desirable antiradical capacity , water solubility and water/oil holding capacity.
