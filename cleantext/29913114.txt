  Young adults ( N = 80) participated in advance care planning ( ACP) as part of a death and dying course and submitted reflection papers on their experiences. These papers were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis methods. Among the findings , participants almost exclusively chose a parent or other family member as a Health Care Agent. Twenty-five percent expressed concern about placing burden on their agent , but felt their advance directives ( AD) would ease that burden. For many , previous experiences with death helped shape their wishes. This research has practice implications for recruiting more healthy young adults in completing their AD.
