  Pharmacological glucocorticoid treatment is associated with adverse metabolic consequences such as hypertension , overweight , reduced glucose tolerance , diabetes mellitus and ultimately increased mortality in cardiovascular disease. Here we review the evidence of detrimental effects of hormone replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency ( AI). Registry studies indicate increased cardiovascular mortality , hypertension , diabetes , and dyslipidemia in both primary and secondary AI , but when cohorts with carefully characterized patients are studied the picture is less clear , and recently patients with primary AI was reported to have less hypertension and lower body mass index than controls. Whether near physiological replacement therapy increase long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in AI is still unclear.
