  Rupture of small intestinal varices associated with portal hypertension can be a serious condition that is difficult to diagnose early and to manage. Moreover , optimal guidelines for the treatment of small intestinal varices have not yet been established. We herein report a case of a 73-year-old man with small intestinal varices. The man presented with bleeding from a stoma in the small intestine , which subsequently led to hemorrhagic shock<symptom>. We successfully treated the patient with balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration via the right inferior epigastric vein using N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate.
