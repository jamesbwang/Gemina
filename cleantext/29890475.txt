  Ozonation and subsequent post-treatments are increasingly implemented in wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) for enhanced micropollutant abatement. While this technology is effective , micropollutant oxidation leads to the formation of ozonation transformation products ( OTPs). Target and suspect screening provide information about known parent compounds and known OTPs , but for a more comprehensive picture , non-target screening is needed. Here , sampling was conducted at a full-scale WWTP to investigate OTP formation at four ozone doses ( 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 mg/L , ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 gO
