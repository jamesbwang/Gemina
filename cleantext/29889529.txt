  First-principles calculations have been used to investigate the potential use of circular dichroism ( CD) spectroscopy in single-molecule sensing. Using a real-space implementation of time-dependent density functional theory ( TDDFT) , several systems involving single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNT) and small molecules have been studied to evaluate their CD response. Large induced CD ( ICD) effects , differing for each test molecule , were observed in all SWCNT-molecule complexes. As the SWCNT used in this study shows no intrinsic CD response , the ICD spectra are the result of interaction with the small molecules. This finding is general and independent of the ( a) chiral nature of the adsorbed molecule. Our results indicate that it is possible to design a system that uses SWCNT for detection of molecules using the change in CD spectrum of the system induced by adsorption of the molecule onto the SWCNT surface.
