  Restricted Spectral Accuracy ( RSA<pathogen>) is applied to Orbitrap data ( 240,000 resolution at m/z 400) to more clearly break out the scoring and ranking of allowable elemental compositions ( EC) in a candidate list. The correct EC is usually top ranked and separated from other answers by 10-40 % within the dimensionless 0-100 % scale , providing a single , definitive EC. The A +2 position ( where A denotes the monoisotopic line position) is especially advantageous in RSA<pathogen>. It has enough intensity and more complexity than ( A +1) fine lines and is like a fingerprint. Avoidance of coalescene phenomena and careful ion population control are essential.
