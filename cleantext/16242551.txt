  The treatment of secondary aortoenteric fistula<disease> ( SAEF) involves maintaining hemodynamic stability , infection control , revascularization , and surgical repair. Conventional open repair is associated with high mortality , whereas endovascular stent-graft repair is associated with recurrent infection or bleeding. We report the case of an 85-year-old man with SAEF who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and retroperitoneal abscess<disease> He was misdiagnosed for 5 months. SAEF was eventually diagnosed by CT and gastroduodenoscopy. The patient underwent hybrid open surgery: extraanatomic left axillofemoral bypass graft reconstruction , exploratory laparotomy , aortic stent graft excision , infrarenal abdominal aortic suture , left common iliac artery ligation , extensive surgical debridement , and retroperitoneal abscess<disease> resolution and drainage , along with duodenal defect repair and jejunal feeding tube placement. He survived the complicated surgery and several life-threatening complications with multidisciplinary management. He has kept well for 15 months. Elderly SAEF patients can undergo open repair when circumstances permit , but multidisciplinary management is crucial.
