  Arginase I ( ARG1) deficiency is an autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder , caused by deficiency of the enzyme Arginase I , resulting in accumulation of arginine in blood. Current Standard of Care ( SOC) for ARG1 deficiency in patients or those having detrimental mutations of ARG1 gene is diet control. Despite diet and drug therapy with nitrogen scavengers , ~ 25 % of patients suffer from severe mental deficits and loss of ambulation. 75 % of patients whose symptoms can be managed through diet therapy continue to suffer neuro-cognitive deficits. In our research , we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that administration of ARG1 mRNA increased ARG1 protein expression and specific activity in relevant cell types , including ARG1-deficient patient cell lines , as well as in wild type mice for up to 4 days. These studies demonstrate that ARG1 mRNA treatment led to increased functional protein expression of ARG1 and subsequently an increase in urea. Hence , ARG1 mRNA therapy could be a potential treatment option to develop for patients.
