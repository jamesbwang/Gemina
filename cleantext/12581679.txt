  Diastolic dysfunction ( DD) identified on echocardiography predicts mortality after cardiac surgery , however the most useful diastolic parameters for assessment and the association of DD with prolonged mechanical ventilation , ICU re-admission , and hospital length of stay are not established. We included patients that underwent coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) , aortic valve replacement ( AVR) or a combined procedure ( CAB-AVR) from 2010 to 2016 , and who had preoperative transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE) at our institution within 6 months of the operation. Diastolic function was graded using the transmitral E and A waves and the septal tissue Doppler velocity. We performed logistic regression to assess the association of grade of DD with a composite endpoint of death , prolonged mechanical ventilation , ICU readmission during hospitalization , and hospital length of stay longer than 14 days. Between 2010 and 2016 , 577 patients were eligible for inclusion. DD was common , with 42 % of the cohort manifesting grade II or grade III DD. Rates of death and prolonged ventilation increased across grades of DD and across quartiles of increasing LV filling pressure , assessed by the E/e ' ratio. Adjusting for age , sex , procedure , systolic and diastolic function , both systolic ( odds ratio 0.68 95 % CI 0.55-0.85 per inter-quartile increase in LVEF) and diastolic function ( odds ratio 1.31 95 % CI 1.04-1.66 per increasing DD grade) both independently predicted outcome. Diastolic dysfunction is common among patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is associated with death , prolonged mechanical ventilation , and prolonged hospital and ICU length of stay independent of systolic dysfunction.
