  Background and aim No studies have been published regarding the results of lumbar spine surgery a in population-based setting in Finland. Our objective was to investigate functional capacity and quality of life after lumbar spine surgery in a population-based cohort in Northern Finland , focusing on working-age patients. Methods This was a cross-sectional postal survey. Three questionnaires ( a self-made questionnaire , the Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire and the SF-36) were sent the patients aged 18-65 years who had undergone lumbar spine surgery due to disc herniation , instability or spinal stenosis in the Oulu University Hospital between June 2005 and May 2008. Results The postal survey was sent to 814 patients , of whom 537 patients ( 66 %) replied. Of these , 361 ( 67 %) underwent disc surgery , 85 ( 16 %) stabilizing surgery and 91 ( 17 %) decompression. Pain was absent or present only occasional in 51 % in the disc surgery group , whereas it was present daily in 59 % in the stabilizing surgery group and in 58 % in the decompression group ( P < 0.001). Axial pain was slightly more intense than radicular pain. Pain was milder in the disc surgery group compared with the stabilizing surgery and decompression groups: mean ( SD) axial pain with 0-10 NRS was 4.0 ( 2.3) , 4.7 ( 2.4) and 4 ( 2.3) respectively ( P = 0.002) and radicular pain 3.5 ( 2.6) , 4.2 ( 2.8) , 4.5 ( 2.6) respectively ( P < 0.001). The total ODI score ( mean , SD) was 20 ( 17) in the disc surgery group , 35 ( 17) in the stabilizing surgery group and 32 ( 17) in the decompression group ( P < 0.001). The physical dimension sum score from the SF-was 42 ( 11) in the disc surgery group and 34 ( 10) in the stabilizing surgery and decompression grou ( P < 0.001). Mental sum scores did not vary significantly between the groups. Conclusions and Implications Outcome was good after lumbar disc operations but less favourable after stabilizing surgery and decompression regarding pain , functional capacity and quality of life. This study offers important information about outcome after lumbar spine surgery in Oulu University Hospital. It also brings out that in Finland we need systematic national spine register , with accurate pre-and postoperative data.
