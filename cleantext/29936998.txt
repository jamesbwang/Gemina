  This study investigated the effects of duodenal-jejunal bypass ( DJB) and new biliopancreatic diversion ( NBPD) on blood glucose and lipid levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). An additional goal was to explore the potential mechanism or mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of surgery on T2DM. Rats were fed a high-fat , high-glucose diet and then were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin , 35 mg/kg , to induce T2DM. Then , 33 T2DM rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups , a DJB group , an NBPD group , or a sham group. Fasting body<symptom> weight , fasting glucose , and 2-h postprandial glucose were measured before and after surgery. Then , the rats were intragastrically administered lipid emulsion , peanut oil , glucose , starch , and Ansul , and blood glucose and lipid levels were measured. One week after surgery , 2-h postprandial glucose decreased from 24.41 ± 2.28 mmol/L before surgery to 19.87 ± 4.07 mmol/L after surgery in the DJB group , and from 25.88 ± 1.91 mmol/L before surgery to 20.34 ± 5.76 mmol/L after surgery in the NBPD group. After intragastric administration of lipid emulsion , free fatty acid levels increased from 534.60 ± 70.99 to 1082.83 ± 259.67 μEq/L in the DJB group and from 648.33 ± 139.26 to 1258.67 ± 204.18 μEq/L in the NBPD group. After surgery , free fatty acid levels in the DJB group and NBPD group were significantly lower than those in the sham group. Postprandial blood glucose and lipids decreased after DJB and NBPD , which may be ascribed to postoperative changes in digestion and absorption.
