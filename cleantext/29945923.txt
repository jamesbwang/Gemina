  Therapeutic antibodies can provoke an antidrug antibody ( ADA) response , which can form soluble immune complexes with the drug in potentially high amounts. Nevertheless , ADA-associated adverse events are usually rare , although with notable exceptions including infliximab. The immune activating effects and the eventual fate of these ` anti-idiotype ' complexes are poorly studied , hampering assessment of ADA-associated risk of adverse events. We investigated the in vitro formation and biological activities of ADA-drug anti-idiotype immune complexes using patient-derived monoclonal anti-infliximab antibodies. Size distribution and conformation of ADA-drug complexes were characterised by size-exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy. Internalisation of and immune activation by complexes of defined size was visualised with flow imaging , whole blood cell assay and C4b/c ELISA. Size and conformation of immune complexes depended on the concentrations and ratio of drug and ADA; large complexes ( > 6 IgGs) formed only with high ADA titres. Macrophages efficiently internalised tetrameric and bigger complexes in vitro , but not dimers. Corroborating these results , ex vivo analysis of patient sera demonstrated only dimeric complexes in circulation.No activation of immune cells by anti-idiotype complexes was observed , and only very large complexes activated complement. Unlike Fc-linked hexamers , anti-idiotype hexamers did not activate complement , demonstrating that besides size , conformation governs immune complex potential for triggering effector functions. Anti-idiotype ADA-drug complexes generally have restricted immune activation capacity. Large , irregularly shaped complexes only form at high concentrations of both drug and ADA , as may be achieved during intravenous infusion of infliximab , explaining the rarity of serious ADA-associated adverse events.
