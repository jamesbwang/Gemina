  Integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into host DNA is an essential step in the replication cycle of HIV-1 and other retroviruses and is an important therapeutic target for drugs. DNA integration is catalyzed by the viral integrase protein and proceeds through a series of stable nucleoprotein complexes of integrase , viral DNA ends and target DNA. These nucleoprotein complexes are collectively called intasomes. Retroviral intasomes undergo a series of transitions between initial formation and catalysis of the DNA cutting and joining steps of DNA integration. Intasomes , rather than free integrase protein , are the target of currently approved drugs that target HIV-1 DNA integration. High-resolution structures of HIV-1 intasomes are needed to understand their detailed mechanism of action and how HIV-1 may escape by developing resistance. Here , we focus on our current knowledge of the structure and function of HIV-1 intasomes , with reference to related systems as required to put this knowledge in context.
