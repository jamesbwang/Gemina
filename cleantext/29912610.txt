  The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine postoperative pain and surgical outcomes ( operative time , hospital stay , the incidence of seroma and recurrence) with different mesh fixation methods following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair ( LVHR). Randomized clinical trials compared different methods of mesh fixation in LVHR and reported on pain outcome measures analyzed. The results were expressed as odds ratio ( OR) for combined dichotomous and mean difference ( MD) for continuous data. Five randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) with a total of 466 patients comparing tack mesh fixation to suture mesh fixation technique in LVHR were identified , all were published after 2005. A meta-analysis gave statistically similar odds of postoperative chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ( OR , 1.24; 95 % CI , 0.65-2.38; z = 0.65; P = .51). No difference in pain intensity ( PI) scores was found at 4-6 weeks ( MD , 0.18; % CI , -0.48 to 0.85; z = 0.54; P = .59) and at 3-6 months postoperatively ( MD , 0.10; 95 % CI , -0.21 to 0.42; z = 0.64; P = .52). There was no difference in the pooled analysis of seroma/hematoma formation ( OR , 0.60; 95 % CI , 0.29-1.26; z = 1.35; P = .18) , recurrence ( OR , 1.11; 95 % CI , 0.34-3.62; z = 0.18; P = .86) , and hospital stay ( MD , -0.06; 95 % CI , -0.19 to 0.08; z = 0.83; P = .40). Operative time was significantly lower with tack fixation ( MD , -19.25; 95 % CI , -27.98 to -10.51; z = 4.32; P < .05). Meta-analysis of RCTs comparing tacks to suture fixation in LVHR showed comparable results with regard to postoperative chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> incidence and PI , and hernia recurrence. However , the operative time is shorter with tacks compared to suture fixation technique.
