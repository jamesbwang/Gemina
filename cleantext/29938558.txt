  Fused deposition modeling ( FDM) is a promising 3D printing technique for the fabrication of personalized drug dosage forms and patient-specific implants. However , there are no market products produced by FDM available at this time. One of the reasons is the lack of a consistent and harmonized approval procedure. In this study , three FDM printers have been characterised with respect to printing parameters relevant for pharmaceutical and medical applications , namely the positioning , hot-end temperature , material residence time , printing velocity and volumetric material flow. The printers are the Ultimaker 2 ( UM2) , the PRotos v3 ( PR3) as well as an in-house developed printer ( IDP). The positioning results showed discrepancies between the printers , which are mainly based on different types of drive systems. Due to comparable utilised hot-ends and nozzle geometries , the results for the temperature and residence time distribution measurements were quite similar. The IDP has a high positioning accuracy but is limited with respect to printing velocity , while the achievable material volume flows were different for all printers. The presented characterisation method aims to contribute to the development of a harmonized equipment qualification framework for FDM printers , which could lead to an acceleration and facilitation of an approval procedure for 3D printed products.
