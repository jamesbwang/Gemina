  Amphiphilic poly ( amidoamine) ( PAMAM) dendrimers are a well-known dendritic family due to their remarkable ability to self-assemble on solid surface. However , the relationship between molecular conformation ( or adsorption kinetics) of a self-assembled layer and molecular amphiphilicity of such kind of dendrimer is still lacking , which limits the development of modulating self-assembling structures and surface functionality. With this in mind , we synthesized a series of amphiphilic PAMAM-based dendrimers , denoted as G
