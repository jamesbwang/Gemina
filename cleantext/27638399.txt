  Despite widespread and liberal use of oxygen supplementation , guidelines about rational use of oxygen are scarce. Recent data demonstrates that current protocols lead to hyperoxemia in the majority of the patients and most health care professionals are not aware of the negative effects of hyperoxemia. To investigate the effects of hyperoxemia in acutely ill patients on clinically relevant outcomes , such as neurological and functional status as well as mortality , we performed a literature review using Medline ( PubMed) and Embase. We used the following terms: hyperoxemia OR hyperoxemia OR ( `` oxygen inhalation therapy '' AND ( mortality OR death OR outcome OR survival)) OR ( oxygen AND ( mortality OR death OR outcome OR survival)). Original studies about the clinical effects of hyperoxemia in adult patients suffering from acute or emergency illnesses were included. 37 articles were included , of which 31 could be divided into four large groups: cardiac arrest , traumatic brain injury ( TBI) , stroke , and sepsis<disease>. Although a single study demonstrated a transient protective effect of hyperoxemia after TBI , other studies revealed higher mortality rates after cardiac arrest , stroke , and TBI treated with oxygen supplementation leading to hyperoxemia. Approximately half of the studies showed no association between hyperoxemia and clinically relevant outcomes. Liberal oxygen therapy leads to hyperoxemia in a majority of patients and hyperoxemia may negatively affect survival after acute illness. As a clinical consequence , aiming for normoxemia may limit negative effects of hyperoxemia in patients with acute illness.
