  We aimed to research in detail the morphology of the facet orientation ( FO) and tropism ( FT) in degenerative diseases. This study consisted of patients with disc degeneration ( DD) and with lumbar spondylolisthesis ( LS) as well as a control group without these two diseases. The group of patients with DD was separated by DD grades. Vertebral body and intervertebral discs ' ( IVDs) morphometric values , facet joint osteoarthritis ( OA) grading , FO and FT were examined in all the groups. All measurements were applied to MRIs of 353 patients. There was a significant difference in facet angle values between the groups at L4-L5 ( FO: p = 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between FO at L4-L5 and L4 vertebral body anterior posterior diameter and L5 mid-vertebral body height , in 353 patients ( p = 0.003; p = 0.010). Facet joint OA grading scores were lower in the control group than in the disc degeneration patient ( DDP) and LS groups ( p < 0.05). Sagittal FO was seen with the increase of facet joint OA scores at L4-L5 in the control and DDP groups ( control: p = 0.001; DDP: p = 0.40). Facet joints can show different orientation values in LS and DDP groups at L4-L5. The presence of FT is a risk factor for an LS patient at L4-L5. Sagittal FO is seen with vertebral slip at L5-S1. FO is affected by the morphometric changes of the vertebral body at L4-L5. Discussions in this regard need to be resolved through further research.
