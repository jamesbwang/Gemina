  Carboxylesterase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-mediated metabolism of irinotecan ( CPT-11) has long been proposed to be responsible for its anti-tumor activity and toxicity , like delayed-onset diarrhea<disease> However , recent studies failed to gain more comprehensive in vivo and in vitro pharmacokinetic profiles of irinotecan. Herein , we use rat plasma , human liver microsomes and immortalized HepG2 cell as experimental subjects to describe a sensitive and versatile UHPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneously quantifying CPT-11 and its metabolites , including SN-38 and SN-38G. The method was applied to investigate the pharmacokinetic and metabolic behavior of CPT-11 in the biological samples. Calibration curves for all bio-matrices showed acceptable linearity ( r
