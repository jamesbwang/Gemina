  A novel tadalafil analogue , which exhibits similarity to 2-hydroxypropylnortadalafil , was found in dietary supplements using adulterants screening and isolated using column chromatography. By using extensive 1D- and 2D-NMR and MS spectral analyses , the structure was determined as 6- ( 1,3-Benzodioxol-5-yl) -2,3,6,7,12,12 a-hexahydro-2- ( 3-hydroxypropyl) pyrazino ( 1 ' ,2 ': 1,6) pyrido ( 3,4-b) indole-1,4-dione , and the analogue was named N-3-hydroxypropylnortadalafil.
