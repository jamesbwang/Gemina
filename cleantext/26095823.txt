  Urea-formaldehyde ( UF) resins are the most used resins in the wood industry due to high reactivity and low price. However , their reduced stability during storage is a drawback , imposing strict limits in terms of allowable shipping distances and storage times. This instability , manifested by viscosity increase that renders the resin unusable , occurs due to the progress of condensation reactions between the polymeric species present in the liquid medium. In order to achieve a stable resin formulation , dimethylurea ( DMeU) was selected for being less reactive than urea. Dimethylurea is shown to co-polymerize with the UF polymer during the acidic synthesis condensation step. However , during storage it behaves like an end group blocker , due to its lower reactivity at basic pH. By adding 1.25 % DMeU , it was possible to obtain a formulation that remained with stable viscosity during two-month storage at 40 & deg; C. The reference UF resin remained stable only for eight days in these conditions. Wood particleboards produced with modified resins showed internal bond strengths of about 0.5 N & middot; mm
