  We previously found a chemical , designated as NJ15 , which inhibited both auxin and brassinosteroid responses in dark-grown Arabidopsis. To study its mode of action , we performed a phenotypic screening of NJ15-low-sensitive lines among mutant pools of Arabidopsis. One line ( f127) showed clear NJ15-low-sensitivity in terms of hypocotyl elongation and shoot gravitropism. After further testing , it was determined that DCR , an enzyme involved in cutin polymerization , had lost its function in the mutant , which caused its low sensitivity to NJ15. Fatty acids are the base materials for polymers such as cutin and cuticular wax. We confirmed that NJ15 affects fatty acid biosynthesis , and that it does differently from cafenstrole , a known inhibitor of cuticular wax formation. Based on these results , we propose that the target of NJ15 is likely located within the cutin polymer formation pathway. Caf: cafenstrole; DEG: differentially expressed gene; FDR: false discovery rate; FOX: full length cDNA-overexpressor; VLCFA: very-long-chain fatty acid.
