  Dysgerminomas are malignant germ cell tumors of the ovary that most commonly occur in the adolescent population. Ovarian dysgerminoma presenting with complications like torsion is a rare entity in the pediatric age group. Cross-sectional imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis , tumor staging before surgical resection , and for planning adjuvant chemotherapy. We report a case of a nine-year-old female who presented to the emergency room ( ER) with abdominal<symptom> distention<symptom> and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> Computed tomography scan revealed a large right-sided pelvic mass with areas of low attenuation , speckled calcification , peritumoral free fluid , and a twisted vascular pedicle that was likely originating from the left adnexa. The right ovary was normal in appearance. Suspicion of a left-sided ovarian tumor with torsion was raised , which was later confirmed on surgery and histopathology of the resected specimen.
