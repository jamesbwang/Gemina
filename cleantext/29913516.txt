  Opioid overdose survivors have an increased risk for death. Whether use of medications for opioid use disorder ( MOUD) after overdose is associated with mortality is not known. To identify MOUD use after opioid overdose and its association with all-cause and opioid-related mortality. Retrospective cohort study. 7 individually linked data sets from Massachusetts government agencies. 17 568 Massachusetts adults without cancer who survived an opioid overdose between 2012 and 2014. Three types of MOUD were examined: methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT) , buprenorphine , and naltrexone. Exposure to MOUD was identified at monthly intervals , and persons were considered exposed through the month after last receipt. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine MOUD as a monthly time-varying exposure variable to predict time to all-cause and opioid-related mortality. In the 12 months after a nonfatal overdose , 2040 persons ( 11 %) enrolled in MMT for a median of 5 months ( interquartile range , 2 to 9 months) , 3022 persons ( 17 %) received buprenorphine for a median of 4 months ( interquartile range , 2 to 8 months) , and 1099 persons ( 6 %) received naltrexone for a median of 1 month ( interquartile range , 1 to 2 months). Among the entire cohort , all-cause mortality was 4.7 deaths ( 95 % CI , 4.4 to 5.0 deaths) per 100 person-years and opioid-related mortality was 2.1 deaths ( CI , 1.9 to 2.4 deaths) per 100 person-years. Compared with no MOUD , MMT was associated with decreased all-cause mortality ( adjusted hazard ratio ( AHR) , 0.47 ( CI , 0.32 to 0.71)) and opioid-related mortality ( AHR , 0.41 ( CI , 0.24 to 0.70)). Buprenorphine was associated with decreased all-cause mortality ( AHR , 0.63 ( CI , 0.46 to 0.87)) and opioid-related mortality ( AHR , 0.62 ( CI , 0.41 to 0.92)). No associations between naltrexone and all-cause mortality ( AHR , 1.44 ( CI , 0.84 to 2.46)) or opioid-related mortality ( AHR , 1.42 ( CI , 0.73 to 2.79)) were identified. Few events among naltrexone recipients preclude confident conclusions. A minority of opioid overdose survivors received MOUD. Buprenorphine and MMT were associated with reduced all-cause and opioid-related mortality. National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.
