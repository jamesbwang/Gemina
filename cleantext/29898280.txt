  This study aimed to identify the incidence of perioperative acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( UGIB) in our hip fracture patients; to evaluate the characteristics , management and clinical outcomes of these patients; and to explore risk factors and protective factors. Of the 1691 consecutive patients admitted for surgical management of hip fractures , 11 ( 0.65 %) had UGIB and a further four patients for each case were selected as controls for evaluation of risk factors and protective factors. Pre-existing peptic ulcer<disease> disease<disease> was identified as a risk factor for acute UGIB ( odds ratio 7.9; 95 % confidence interval: 1.1-54.9). This study reported a very low incidence of UGIB in hip fracture patients. Despite being a high-risk population , timely endoscopic evaluation can be safely undertaken to optimise patient outcome. When risk factors such as history of peptic ulcer<disease> disease<disease> are present , additional precaution including gastro-protective agent and nutritional support should be undertaken.
