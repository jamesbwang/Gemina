  We employed an echocardiographic ( ECHO) system as the backbone for the collection of electrocardiogram ( ECG) and heart rate variability ( HRV) data. The system was tested using an exercise model in which C57 male mice were exposed to sham or forced wheel running. Peak/peak ( RR) interval was recorded over a 3 min period using the ECG platform of the ECHO system. Isoflurane-anesthetized male mice were divided into two groups ( Results document the utility of combining the ECHO and the ECG platform , allowing for the dual measurement of autonomic and cardiac function in mice.
