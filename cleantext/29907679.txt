  In ovarian cancer , the prometastatic RTK AXL promotes motility , invasion and poor prognosis. Here , we show that reduced survival caused by AXL overexpression can be mitigated by the expression of the GPI-anchored tumour suppressor OPCML Further , we demonstrate that AXL directly interacts with OPCML , preferentially so when AXL is activated by its ligand Gas6. As a consequence , AXL accumulates in cholesterol-rich lipid domains , where OPCML resides. Here , phospho-AXL is brought in proximity to the lipid domain-restricted phosphatase PTPRG , which de-phosphorylates the RTK/ligand complex. This prevents AXL-mediated transactivation of other RTKs ( cMET and EGFR) , thereby inhibiting sustained phospho-ERK signalling , induction of the EMT transcription factor Slug , cell migration and invasion. From a translational perspective , we show that OPCML enhances the effect of the phase II AXL inhibitor R428
