  High global incidence of obesity has led to efforts to identify factors that may contribute to elevated body mass index ( BMI). Studies have shown individuals with obesity tend to display an attentional bias ( AB) towards food. Left frontal EEG alpha asymmetry ( FA) has been associated with motivation to approach rewards and may heighten reactivity to food cues. The current study thus explored whether the association between AB to food and BMI is moderated by FA. EEG was recorded while 93 female participants watched a video confederate incidentally consume potato chips. Participants subsequently completed a visual-probe task to assess AB towards food. Results revealed that AB was positively associated with BMI when FA was skewed left but not right. Individuals ' predisposition to approach appetitive stimuli may interact with a bias to attend to food to facilitate overconsumption in obesogenic food environments. Future studies should examine this interaction in relation to consumption.
