  About 10-20 % of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC) are candidates for metastasis directed therapies such as surgical resection , ablation and stereotactic radiotherapy. We examined the temporal changes in use of metastasis directed therapies and established prognostic factors for survival in a nationwide cohort study. The Danish nationwide medical registries were used to retrieve data on treatment for liver and/or lung metastasis in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the period 2000-2013. Overall survival through 2014 was calculated from the time of treatment of metastases by Kaplan-Meier method and mortality between groups was assessed using Cox regression. We report 2912 patients undergoing a total of 3602 procedures with an increased use of all modalities during 14 calendar years. Median survival was 3.7 years ( interquartile range ( IQR) 2.0-9.7 years). In the multivariate analysis the nodal stage of the primary tumor had the most pronounced association with survival with a hazard ratio for mortality of 1.56 ( 95 % CI: 1.33-1.83) for N2 stage with reference to N0. Furthermore , female gender , age , comorbidity , surgical treatment , administration of chemotherapy and left sided primary tumors were associated with improved prognosis in the multivariate analysis.
