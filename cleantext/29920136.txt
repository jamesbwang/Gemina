  Mastering proper force manipulation in minimally invasive surgery can take many hours of practice and training. Improper force control can lead to necrosis<symptom> , infection , and scarring. A force-sensing skin ( FSS) has been developed , which measures forces at the distal end of minimal access surgeries ' ( MAS) instruments without altering the instrument 's structural integrity or the surgical workflow , and acts as a minimally disruptive add-on to any MAS instrument. A proof of concept study was conducted using a FSS-equipped 5 mm straight-tip needle holder. Participants ( n = 19: 3 novices , 11 fellows , and 5 staff surgeons) performed one intracorporeal suturing knot task ( ISKT). Using participant task video footage , each participant 's two puncture forces ( each wall of the Penrose drain) and three knot tightening forces were measured. Force metrics from the three expertise groups were compared using analysis of variance ( ANOVA) and Tukey 's honest significance test with statistical significance assessed at P < .05. Preliminary ISKT force metric data showed differences between novices and more experienced fellows and surgeons. Of the five stages of the ISKT evaluated , the first puncture force of the Penrose drain seemed to best reflect the difference in skill among participants. The study demonstrated ISKT knot tightening and puncture force ranges across three expertise levels ( novices , surgical fellows , and staff surgeons) of 0.586 to 6.089 newtons ( N) and 0.852 to 2.915 N , respectively. The investigation of force metrics is important for the implementation of future force feedback systems as it can provide real-time information to surgeons in training and the operating theater.
