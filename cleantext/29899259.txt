  Fleshy fruits are an important source of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins ( PAs) , which protect plants against stress , and their consumption provides beneficial effects for human health. In strawberry fruit , the application of exogenous methyl jasmonate ( MeJA) upregulates anthocyanin accumulation , although the relationship between the jasmonate pathway and anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis in fruits remains to be understood. Anthocyanin and PA accumulation is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level through R2R3-MYB and bHLH transcription factors in different plant species and organs. Here , the effect of jarin-1 , a specific inhibitor of bioactive JA ( jasmonoyl-isoleucine , JA-Ile) biosynthesis , on anthocyanin and PA accumulation was evaluated during strawberry (
