  To evaluate the effects of a polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA) supplement on reproductive parameters of suckled beef cows , two experiments were conducted. In Experiment ( Exp.) 1 , 60 primiparous cows were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: CTRL- 1.36 kg/day of corn gluten feed ( CGF) and MEGR- 1.36 kg/day of CGF and 0.23 kg/day of calcium salts of soybean oil. Supplementation occurred from 30 days before fixed-time artificial insemination ( TAI) until 7 days post-TAI. The expression of interferon-stimulated genes ( ISG) was measured on days 18 and 21. Pregnancy rates were diagnosed on days 30 and 100. Treatment altered plasma fatty acid profile ( P < 0.05) , however , did not change cow BW ( P = 0.52) or body condition score ( BCS) ( P = 0.52). Treatment did not alter ( P = 0.12) pregnancy rates to TAI or final pregnancy rates ( P = 0.56). Treatments did not impact messenger RNA ( mRNA) expression of the ISG OAS1 or MX2 on days 18 ( P = 0.67; P = 0.96 , respectively) or 21 ( P = 0.72; P = 0.17 , respectively). Length of gestation was greater ( P = 0.02) for MEGR , however , treatments did not alter calf birth weight ( P = 0.20). In Exp. two , 66 multiparous cows were assigned to one of two treatments: MEG- 0.65 kg/day of CGF +0.23 kg/day of calcium salts of palm oil and MEGR- 0.65 kg/day of CGF +0.23 kg/day of Ca salts of soybean oil. Cows were supplemented from 30 days prepartum to 30 days postpartum. On day 35 after TAI , pregnancy status , embryo crown-to-rump length ( CRL) , and plasma concentrations of pregnancy-specific protein-B ( PSPB) were evaluated. Treatment altered plasma fatty acid profile ( P < 0.05). In addition , cows from the MEG treatment had greater BW ( P < 0.01) and BCS ( P < 0.01) than those in the MEGR treatment , as well as heavier calves at weaning ( P = 0.03). Treatment did not affect resumption of estrous cycle ( P = 0.29). There were no differences in pregnancy rates to TAI ( P = 0.87) or final pregnancy rates ( P = 0.29). No differences between treatments were detected on CRL ( P = 0.24) and plasma concentrations of PSPB ( P = 0.46). Birth weight ( P = 0.12) and calving distribution ( P = 0.52) were not altered. We concluded that PUFA supplementation altered plasma fatty acid profile , however , did not impact the remaining reproductive parameters evaluated.
