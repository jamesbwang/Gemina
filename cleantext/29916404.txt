  This study examines the relationship between anorexia<symptom> nervosa ( AN) , selflessness , and genderrole identity in young Israeli women and explores their parents ' gender-role identity. Forty-seven AN women and 50 non-clinical controls completed the Eating Attitudes Test ( EAT26) , Eating Disorder Inventory ( EDI-2) , Bem Sex-Role Inventory ( BSRI) , and Selflessness Scale. Twenty-four parents from the AN group , and 41 mothers and 38 fathers from the control group also completed the BSRI. As predicted , masculine traits protected against the detrimental effects of selflessness on eating disorder symptoms. The AN participants obtained lower masculinity scores , their mothers also scoring lower on both the masculinity and femininity measures than the control-group. Conclusions drawn from the BSRI must be adopted with caution since gender-role characteristics may vary over time. The findings suggest the need to integrate the self-psychological approach , which emphasizes the anorexic 's tendency to ignore her own interests in favor of others ' needs , with feminist views that stress the role society plays in putting pressure on women to become alienated from themselves.
