  Cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> ( CL) is one of the most important health problems that are capable of involving both tropical and subtropical areas , especially in Iran. This cross-sectional study aimed to differentiate the species that are able to cause CL in Zahedan city by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP) method. It was conducted on 145 suspected CL patients in Zahedan city between 2014 and 2016. The smears were initially prepared , air-dried , fixed with absolute methanol , and stained with 10 % Giemsa. Then , we examined the stained samples by a light microscope under 1000 Ã— magnifications. PCR assay targeted cytochrome From 145 suspected CL patients , 76 ( 52.4 %) were positive in microscopic examination. In addition , we detected gene of interest ( cyt We concluded that the microscopic examination is not sensitive enough and is not able to distinguish between different
