  Plant litter decomposition in forested soil and watershed is an important source of phosphorus ( P) for plants in forest<disease> ecosystems. Understanding P dynamics during litter decomposition in forested aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems will be of great importance for better understanding nutrient cycling across forest<disease> landscape. However , despite massive studies addressing litter decomposition have been carried out , generalizations across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems regarding the temporal dynamics of P loss during litter decomposition remain elusive. We conducted a two-year field experiment using litterbag method in both aquatic ( streams and riparian zones) and terrestrial ( forest<disease> floors) ecosystems in an alpine forest<disease> on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. By using multigroup comparisons of structural equation modeling ( SEM) method with different litter mass-loss intervals , we explicitly assessed the direct and indirect effects of several biotic and abiotic drivers on P loss across different decomposition stages. The results suggested that ( 1) P concentration in decomposing litter showed similar patterns of early increase and later decrease across different species and ecosystems types; ( 2) P loss shared a common hierarchy of drivers across different ecosystems types , with litter chemical dynamics mainly having direct effects but environment and initial litter quality having both direct and indirect effects; ( 3) when assessing at the temporal scale , the effects of initial litter quality appeared to increase in late decomposition stages , while litter chemical dynamics showed consistent significant effects almost in all decomposition stages across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems; ( 4) microbial diversity showed significant effects on P loss , but its effects were lower compared with other drivers. Our results highlight the importance of including spatiotemporal variations and indicate the possibility of integrating aquatic and terrestrial decomposition into a common framework for future construction of models that account for the temporal dynamics of P in decomposing litter.
