  Relationships between bacterial community and dissolved organic matter ( DOM) include microbial uptake , transformation and secretion , all of which influence DOM composition. In this study , we explore diversity and similarity metrics of dissolved organic molecules ( Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry) and bacterial communities ( tag-sequencing of 16S rRNA genes) along the salinity gradient of the Delaware Estuary ( USA). We found that even though mixing , discharge and seasonal changes explained most of the variation in DOM and bacterial communities , there was still a relationship , albeit weak , between the composition of DOM and bacterial communities in the estuary. Overall , many DOM molecular formulas ( MFs) and bacterial operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) reoccurred over years and seasons , while the frequency of MF-OTU correlations varied. Diversity based on MFs and OTUs was significantly correlated , decreasing towards the open ocean. However , while the diversity of bacterial OTUs dropped markedly with low salinity , MF diversity decreased strongly only at high salinities. We hypothesize that the different turnover times of DOM and bacteria lead to different abundance distributions of OTUs and MFs. A significant portion of the detected DOM is of a more refractory nature with lifetimes largely exceeding the mixing time of the estuary , while bacterial community turnover times in the Delaware Estuary are estimated at several days.
