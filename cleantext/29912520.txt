  This paper reports the case of a patient who sought assisted reproductive technology ( ART) treatment and was referred to pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD) on account of a chromosomal translocation presented with secondary infertility<symptom>. The patient underwent a highly complex ART treatment and had 14 metaphase II oocytes collected on the day of follicular aspiration. The embryos were taken to extended culture and five were biopsied and vitrified. The embryo genetic report showed aneuploidy in four of the blastocysts , while the other resulted in 46 , XX. In conclusion , chromosome translocations involving the X chromosome might result in the deregulation of gene expression and defective ovarian formation. Therefore , the genes present in the X chromosome are believed to be essential in normal ovarian function.
