  It is well known that elevated cortisol after stress or after exogenous administration impairs episodic memory retrieval including autobiographical memory ( AM) retrieval. This impairment might be mediated by deactivation of a neural network associated with memory retrieval including the prefrontal cortex ( PFC) and limbic structures. However , the neural underpinnings of these cortisol effects on AM retrieval have not been investigated yet. In this study , thirty-three healthy women received either placebo or 10 mg hydrocortisone in a double blind cross-over design before completing an AM test during fMRI. In this test , participants are asked to recall specific events from their own past in response to a cue word. In a first step , we analyzed the neural underpinnings of AM retrieval in the placebo condition. We found an activation pattern consistent with core regions involved in autobiographical memory recall , including the ventromedial PFC , anterior medial ( am) PFC , inferior frontal gyrus , the posterior cingulate cortex , the tempoparietal junction , the middle temporal gyrus and the hippocampus. Further , we analyzed brain activation during AM retrieval after hydrocortisone compared to placebo. Region of interest ( ROI) analyses revealed a hydrocortisone-induced deactivation during AM retrieval in the right amPFC. Results of the ROI analyses were non-significant in the left and right hippocampus , the left and right vmPFC and the left amPFC In sum , during AM retrieval hydrocortisone had the most pronounced effects on the amPFC. This might be explained by the strong involvement of this brain region in self-referential behavior , which is essential for recalling autobiographic information.
