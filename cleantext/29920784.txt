  To evaluate response rates and survival in adults with transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy ( TA-TMA) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) who were treated with eculizumab ( ECU). Patients were identified retrospectively and data collected through HSCT and pharmacy databases. Ten patients with TA-TMA after allogeneic HSCT were treated with ECU between 2013 and 2016. TA-TMA was diagnosed at a median of 93 days post-HSCT. Organ-specific injury was documented in all ten patients at time of TA-TMA diagnosis , the most common being renal dysfunction ( 90 %). Acute GVHD ( 70 %) and active infection ( 80 %) were common at time of diagnosis. The median time to ECU initiation from TA-TMA diagnosis was 4 days. Seven patients received ECU as first-line therapy in combination with other treatment modalities , while three patients were treated with ECU as second-line therapy. ECU was well tolerated with the exception of one case of severe<symptom> skin<symptom> rash<symptom> leading to discontinuation. ECU achieved an overall hematologic response rate of 70 % and an overall survival rate of 60 %. One patient achieved a complete response with corresponding organ recovery. Early initiation of ECU may not alter the disease process enough to restore organ function , but it may prolong survival.
