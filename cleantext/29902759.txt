  Metals and pesticides are common pollutants and the modulation of biomarkers can indicate sub-lethal influences on the physiology of organisms inhabiting impacted aquatic systems. We examined the effects of mercury and the organophosphate pesticide dimethoate on EROD , MROD , glutathione S-transferase ( GST) , acetylcholine esterase ( AChE) , metallothionein ( MT) and glutathione ( GSH) in the signal crayfish ( Pacifastacus leniusculus). Crayfish were injected with mercury chloride or dimethoate ( 0.3 , 0.6 , 0.9 Î¼g kg
