  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC) is an epithelial malignancy , with a high metastatic potential. Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) infection plays a fundamental role , even if it is not well understood. The diagnosis of the disease in its early stage is infrequent. Imaging studies , positron emission tomography scans in addition to clinical examination , endoscopic examination , and biopsy provide information on the extent of the disease. The application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concomitant chemoradiation can improve the control of NPC. In March 2016 , a 54-year-old male with NPC cT1 cN2 cM0 , stage III ( 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC) staging system) underwent to a two-step treatment: induction chemotherapy by TPF regimen ( docetaxel , cisplatin , 5-fluorouracil) , followed by concomitant chemoradiotherapy ( weekly cisplatin). The quantity of free plasma EBV-DNA can be related to the disease stage , and the detection of EBV-DNA during follow-up can be predictive of distant metastases. Especially , either plasma or serum EBV-DNA titer is estimated to reflect tumor volume. Biologically , such EBV-DNA reflects reproduced or released DNA from dead or dying tumor cells. On the other hand , EBV-specific DNA released as exosome may reflect the biological feature of the alive NPC tumor cell. The follow-up is ongoing after 21 months from a complete response.
