  Identification of precursors of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) may lead to early detection and prevent associated morbidity and mortality. Atrial premature complexes ( APCs) are commonly seen in healthy subjects. However , there was limited data about the clinical and electrocardiographic ( ECG) characteristics for prediction of new-onset AF in asymptomatic patients with APCs in the long-term follow up. The Kosin University ( No. 2014-02-04) 24-h holter monitoring , echocardiography , ECG database were reviewed from 2008 to 2016 to identify new- onset AF in patients with APCs. We analyzed demographic and clinical features and the nature of the APCs by ECG according to new-onset AF in those patients. Among 652 patients who underwent 24-h holter monitoring , 226 ( 34.4 %) patients had new-onset AF. There was no difference of the baseline characteristics between new-onset AF group and non-AF group. In univariate analysis , hypertension ( HTN) , renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CRF) , high APC burdens , fastest APC running heart rate ( HR) , minimal HR , left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) , left atrial volume index , peak mitral flow velocity of the early rapid filling wave and tricuspid regurgitation grade were significantly associated with new-onset AF. In multivariate analysis , higher APCs burden ( Higher APCs burden , higher fastest APCs running HR and lower minimal HR were associated with new-onset AF in asymptomatic patients with APCs in the long-term follow up.
