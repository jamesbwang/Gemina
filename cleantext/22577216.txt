  We have reported an autopsy case of neuromyelitis optica ( NMO) that exhibited persisting active inflammatory lesions<symptom> in the central nervous system ( CNS) despite a 45-year-long treatment with oral corticosteroids. To our knowledge , our case had received the longest course of maintenance treatment. This case study suggests that the current treatment of NMO with immunosuppressive agents may offer a good prospect for improving life expectancy. On the other hand , it also suggest that microscopic active lesions<symptom> which were clinically silent and difficult to detect by neurological examination or MRI studies may persist in the CNS in patients with NMO , despite prolonged and continuous immunosuppressive treatment.
