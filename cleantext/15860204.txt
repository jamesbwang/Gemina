  3D printed polycaprolactone ( PCL)- blended scaffolds have been designed , prepared , and evaluated in vitro in this study prior to the incorporation of a polyvinyl alcohol ⁻ polyacrylic acid ( PVA ⁻ PAA) hydrogel for the delivery of in situ-formed sodium indomethacin. The prepared PCL ⁻ PVA ⁻ PAA scaffold is proposed as a potential structural support system for load-bearing tissue damage where inflammation<symptom> is prevalent. Uniaxial strain testing of the PCL-blended scaffolds were undertaken to determine the scaffold & rsquo; s resistance to strain in addition to its thermal , structural , and porosimetric properties. The viscoelastic properties of the incorporated PVA ⁻ PAA hydrogel has also been determined , as well as the drug release profile of the PCL ⁻ PVA ⁻ PAA scaffold. Results of these analyses noted the structural strength , thermal stability , and porosimetric properties of the scaffold , as well as the ability of the PCL ⁻ PVA ⁻ PAA scaffold to deliver sodium indomethacin in simulated physiological conditions of pH and temperature. The results of this study therefore highlight the successful design , fabrication , and in vitro evaluation of a 3D printed polymeric strain-resistant supportive platform for the delivery of sodium indomethacin.
