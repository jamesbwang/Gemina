  After radical treatment , most high-grade gliomas ( HGG) recur locally. Upon recurrence , no standard treatment exists. Options include re-resection , salvage systemic therapy and re-irradiation. This retrospective study evaluated patients who underwent re-irradiation for recurrent HGGs and assessed prognostic factors and their influence on management. Eighty-two patients who underwent re-irradiation for HGG from 2009 to 2014 were retrospectively identified. Re-irradiation consisted of either standard three-dimensional conformal , intensity-modulated radiotherapy or highly conformal stereotactic radiotherapy using mostly volumetric modulated arc therapy. Patient survival from re-irradiation was the primary end point. Survival was estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method with differences assessed using the Log-rank test; hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression analysis. The median overall survival from re-irradiation was 9.5 months. Re-irradiation , to a median dose of 35 Gy in 10 fractions , was well tolerated: 4 % developed grade 3 toxicity , no patients experienced grade ≥ 4 or radionecrosis. In the multivariate analysis , factors significantly associated with increased survival included: longer duration from initial radiotherapy , better performance status at re-irradiation of 0-1 versus ≥ 2 , unifocal versus multifocal recurrence and higher total re-irradiation dose ( ≥ 35 Gy versus < 35 Gy). Re-resection , salvage systemic therapy and age were unrelated to survival. Patients with recurrent HGG tolerated re-irradiation well with minimal toxicity. Those patients in good prognostic groups , including good performance status can achieve durable control , suggesting managing patients with regular magnetic resonance imaging surveillance post-radical treatment , identifying early radiological progression and instituting salvage therapy when performance status is best.
