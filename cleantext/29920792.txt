  Aluminum-ion batteries ( AIBs) are regarded as viable alternatives to lithium-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity , their low cost , and the rich abundance of aluminum. However , several serious drawbacks of aqueous systems ( passive film formation , hydrogen evolution , anode corrosion , etc.) hinder the large-scale application of these systems. Thus , nonaqueous AIBs show incomparable advantages for progress in large-scale electrical energy storage. However , nonaqueous aluminum battery systems are still nascent , and various technical and scientific obstacles to designing AIBs with high capacity and long cycling life have not been resolved until now. Moreover , the aluminum cell is a complex device whose energy density is determined by various parameters , most of which are often ignored , resulting in failure to achieve the maximum performance of the cell. The purpose here is to discuss how to further develop reliable nonaqueous AIBs. First , the current status of nonaqueous AIBs is reviewed based on statistical data from the literature. The influence of parameters on energy density is analyzed , and the current situation and existing problems are summarized. Furthermore , possible solutions and concerns regarding the construction of reliable nonaqueous AIBs are comprehensively discussed. Finally , future research directions and prospects in the aluminum battery field are proposed.
