  The positive relationship between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol has been questioned by a set of recent cohort studies. This study aimed to investigate how employment status and education years relate to the association between dietary cholesterol and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) in a Japanese population. A population-based , random sample , cross-sectional study ( INTERLIPID) was performed. Among 1,145 Japanese individuals aged 40-59 years , 106 were excluded because of special diets , use of lipid-lowering drugs , hormone replacement , and missing data , leaving 1,039 individuals ( 533 men and 506 women). Dietary cholesterol was assessed from four 24-h dietary recalls , and LDL-C was measured enzymatically with an auto-analyzer. A standard questionnaire inquired about employment status and education years. In men , a 1 standard deviation ( SD) higher dietary cholesterol was associated with 3.16 mg/dL lower serum LDL-C ( P = 0.009; unadjusted model). After adjustment for covariates , higher serum LDL-C was estimated per 1 SD higher intake of dietary cholesterol in nonemployed men ( self-employed , homemakers , farmers , fishermen , and retired employees; β = ＋ 9.08 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = ＋ 0.90- ＋ 17.27) and less educated men ( β = ＋ 4.46 , 95 % CI = － 0.97- ＋ 9.90) , whereas an inverse association was observed in employed men ( β = － 3.02 , 95 % CI = － 5.49- － 0.54) and more educated men ( β = － 3.66 , 95 % CI = － 6.25- － 1.07). In men who were nonemployed and less educated , a higher intake of dietary cholesterol was associated with elevated concentrations of serum LDL-C , whereas an inverse association was observed in men who were employed and more educated.
