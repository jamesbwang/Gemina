  Patients with brain injury are at high risk for infections. Although infection and cognitive deterioration are established for people with dementia , this has not been shown for patients with a prolonged disorder of consciousness<symptom> ( PDOC). This study determines whether regular Wessex Head Injury Matrix ( WHIM) assessments can identify early signs of infections in patients with PDOC. Retrospective and prospective approaches were used to assess the WHIM scores of patients with a PDOC ( N = 21 in the retrospective study and 22 in the prospective study). The WHIM total scores decreased due to infections in 17 of the 21 cases of infection ( p < 0.001) in the retrospective study and 15 ( p = 0.001) of the 22 prospective cases of infection. Patients in a minimally conscious state ( MCS) showed a bigger proportion of change between their baseline score and the scores taken in the pre-infection stage in both the retrospective and prospective studies when compared to patients in a vegetative state ( VS). The findings suggest the importance of serial WHIM assessments throughout the period of recovery , not only to measure cognitive changes but also to highlight underlying physical changes such as infections that will impact the response to rehabilitation and recovery.
