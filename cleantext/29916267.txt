  This article examines two psychological interventions with Australian Aboriginal children in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The first involved evaluating the cognitive maturation of Aboriginal adolescents using a series of Piagetian interviews. The second , a more extensive educational intervention , used a variety of quantitative tests to measure and intervene in the intellectual performance of Aboriginal preschoolers. In both of these interventions the viability of the psychological instruments in the cross-cultural encounter created ongoing ambiguity as to the value of the research outcomes. Ultimately , the resolution of this ambiguity in favour of notions of Aboriginal ` cultural deprivation ' reflected the broader political context of debates over Aboriginal self-governance during this period.
