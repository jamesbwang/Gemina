  To identify the predictors of dropout in the ` Mexa-se ' intervention according to the body mass index ( BMI) category. This was a controlled , non-randomized study. The intervention included: ( i) increase in the intensity of physical activities ( PA) in physical education ( PE) classes; ( ii) active recess; ( iii) educational sessions on PA , nutrition and body image; and ( iv) educational materials. Dropout was considered when students dropped out of intervention , or did not reach 75 % attendance in PE classes. The independent variables were gender , age , study period , socioeconomic status , BMI , PA , screen time , food consumption , health perception , attitudes toward PA , self-efficacy for PA , perception of the school environment , body image and self-esteem. Binary logistic regression analysis was used. The dropout rate was 26.8 %. In the total sample and among students with an adequate BMI , there was a greater probability of dropout with an increase in age. For overweight students , increased age and socioeconomic status , and studying in the afternoon period were predictors of dropout from the intervention. Socio-demographic factors were predictors of dropout from the ` Mexa-se ' intervention; the associated factors differed based on the BMI category.
