  Abnormal regulation of gene expression is essential for tumorigenesis. Several studies indicate that regulation of oncogene expression and neoplastic transformation are controlled by subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factors ( eIFs). Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 ( eIF3) is the largest ( 800 kDa) and the most complex mammalian initiation factor. It is composed of 13 non-identical polypeptides designated as eIF3a-m and plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis that bridges the 43S pre-initiation complex and eIF4F-bound mRNA. However , the functional roles of individual subunits are not yet very clear. This review presents on several of aberrant expressed eIF3 subunits which are detected in various human cancers and the associated mechanisms have been acknowledged or are still not sure. Finally , identifying novel targets and biomarkers for caner is of great importance in early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. eIF3 may be a novel target molecule in drug development for cancer treatment and prevention.
