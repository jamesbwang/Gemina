  Alcohol or drug impaired driving can cause motor vehicle crashes , injuries , and death. Estimates of drug impaired driving are difficult to obtain. This study explores self-reported prevalence of and factors associated with alcohol , marijuana , and prescription opioid use and impaired driving among adults aged 21 years and older in the U.S. Self-reported data from 3,383 adults in the 2015 Fall ConsumerStyles survey were analyzed. Respondents were asked about alcohol , marijuana , and prescription opioid use and driving while impaired in the last 30 days. Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated. Prevalence ratios and Poisson log-linear regressions were used to identify factors associated with substance use and impaired driving. Alcohol use was reported by 49.5 % ( n = 1,676) of respondents; of these 4.9 % ( n = 82) reported alcohol impaired driving. Marijuana use was reported by 5.5 % ( n = 187) of respondents; of these 31.6 % ( n = 59) reported marijuana impaired driving. Prescription opioid use was reported by 8.8 % ( n = 298) of respondents; of these 3.4 % ( n = 10) reported prescription opioid impaired driving. Polysubstance use of alcohol and marijuana ( concurrent use) was reported by 2.7 % ( n = 93) respondents. Among those , 10.8 % ( n = 10) reported driving impaired by both alcohol and marijuana. Impaired driving was self-reported among alcohol , marijuana , and prescription opioid users. This report demonstrates the need for more robust alcohol and drug-related data collection , reporting , and analyses , as well as the emerging need for surveillance of marijuana and prescription opioid impaired driving. States can consider using proven strategies to prevent impaired driving and evaluate promising practices.
