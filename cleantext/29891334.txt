  The aim of this study was to develop and validate a Spanish-language version of the Scale for Contraversive Pushing , used to diagnose and measure pusher behaviour in stroke patients. Translation-back translation was used to create the Spanish-language Scale for Contraversive Pushing; we subsequently evaluated its validity and reliability by administering it to a sample of patients. We also analysed its sensitivity to change in patients identified as pushers who received neurological physiotherapy. Experts indicated that the content of the scale was valid. Internal consistency was very good ( Cronbach 's alpha of 0.94). The intraclass correlation coefficient showed high intra- and interobserver reliability ( 0.999 and 0.994 , respectively). The Kappa and weighted Kappa coefficients were used to measure the reliability of each item; the majority obtained values above 0.9. Lastly , the differences between baseline and final evaluations of pushers were significant ( paired sample t test) , showing that the scale is sensitive to changes obtained through physical therapy. The Spanish-language version of the Scale for Contraversive Pushing is valid and reliable for measuring pusher behaviour in stroke patients. In addition , it is able to evaluate the ongoing changes in patients who have received physical therapy.
