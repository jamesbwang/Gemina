  This study aimed to preliminarily investigate the feasibility of intravoxel incoherent motion ( IVIM) theory in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules<symptom>. Forty-five patients with 56 confirmed thyroid nodules<symptom> underwent preoperative routine magnetic resonance imaging and IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging. The histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed by surgery. Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) , perfusion fraction f , diffusivity D , and pseudo-diffusivity D * were quantified. Independent samples t test of IVIM-derived metrics were conducted between benign and malignant nodules<symptom>. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were performed to determine the optimal thresholds as well as the sensitivity and specificity for differentiating. Significant intergroup difference was observed in ADC , D , D * , and f ( p < 0.001). Malignant tumors featured significantly lower ADC , D and D * values and a higher f value than that of benign nodules<symptom>. The ADC , D , and D * could distinguish the benign from malignant thyroid nodules<symptom> , and parameter f differentiate the malignant tumors from benign nodules<symptom>. The values of the area under the curve for parameter ADC , D , and D * were 0.784 ( p = 0.001) , 0.795 ( p = 0.001) , and 0.850 ( p < 0.001) , separately , of which the area under the curve of f value was the maximum for identifying the malignant from benign nodules<symptom> , which was 0.841 ( p < 0.001). This study suggested that ADC and IVIM-derived metrics , including D , D * , and f , could potentially serve as noninvasive predictors for the preoperative differentiating of thyroid nodules<symptom> , and f value performed best in identifying the malignant from benign nodules<symptom> among these parameters.
