  Recently published North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis guidelines call for derivation of a specific radiologic definition of MS WM lesions<symptom> and mimics. The purpose of this study was to use SWI and magnetization-prepared FLAIR images for sensitive differentiation of MS from benign WM lesions<symptom> using the morphologic characteristics of WM lesions<symptom>. Seventeen patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 18 healthy control subjects were enrolled retrospectively. For each subject , FLAIR and multiecho gradient-echo images were acquired using 7T MR imaging. Optimized postprocessing was used to generate single-slice SWI of cerebral veins. SWI/FLAIR images were registered , and 3 trained readers performed lesion<symptom> assessment. Morphology , location of lesions<symptom> , and the time required for assessment were recorded. Analyses were performed on 3 different pools: 1) lesions<symptom> of > 3 mm , 2) nonconfluent lesions<symptom> of > 3 mm , and 3) nonconfluent lesions<symptom> of > 3 mm with no or a single central vein. The SWI/FLAIR acquisition and processing protocol enabled effective assessment of central veins and hypointense rims in WM lesions<symptom>. Assessment of nonconfluent lesions<symptom> with ≥ 1 central vein enabled the most specific and sensitive differentiation of patients with MS from controls. A threshold of 67 % perivenous WM lesions<symptom> separated patients with MS from controls with a sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 100 %. Lesion<symptom> assessment took an average of 12 minutes 10 seconds and 4 minutes 33 seconds for patients with MS and control subjects , respectively. Nonconfluent lesions<symptom> of > 3 mm with ≥ 1 central vein were the most sensitive and specific differentiators between patients with MS and control subjects.
