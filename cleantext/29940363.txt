  Rapid quantification of absolute microbial cell abundances is important for a comprehensive interpretation of microbiome surveys and crucial to support theoretical modelling and the design of engineered systems. In this paper , we propose a protocol specifically optimised for the quantification of microbial abundances in water biofilters using flow cytometry ( FCM). We optimised cell detachment from sand biofilter particles for FCM quantification through the evaluation of five chemical dispersants ( NaCl , Triton-X100 , CaCl
