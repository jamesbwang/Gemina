  In spite of the remarkable achievements in the health care sector over recent decades , inequities in accessibility and affordability of these facilities coexist throughout Pakistan , which has led us to explore and document the cultural knowledge of medicinal plants used in skin disorders by the local community members of Manoor Valley , Pakistan. Field investigations were undertaken during the summer seasons of 2015-2017 , and cultural practices of medicinal plants usage for treating various ailments were gathered through interviews with the local inhabitants. Ethnomedicinal insights of the medicinal plants used for skin ailments were gained with recorded data assessed through different statistical packages for evaluation of principal components analysis , species disease curve , and two-way cluster analysis. We conclude that plants play an important role as ethnomedicine in daily life and especially in the health care of the people living in the study area.
