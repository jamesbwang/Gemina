  E26 transformation-specific variant 6 gene ( ETV6) is one of the most consistently rearranged genes in acute leukaemia. It encodes a principal hematopoietic transcription factor. We performed a systematic review focusing on the mechanisms responsible for etv6 acquisition , and its effect on the development of AML. We also review the Characteristics of ETV6 mutations and its fusion genes. Finally , for using ETV6 as a molecular target , we discuss future therapeutic approaches available to mitigate the associated disease. ETV6 rearrangements often accompany other molecular mutations. Thirty-three distinct partner bands of ETV6 that contain various fusion genes were detected which plays a vital role in obtaining information about leukaemia genesis. RXDX-101 and PKC412 were reported to be inhibitors of ETV6-NTRK3. Future researches are needed to explain how ETV6 mutations act within the microenvironment of leukemic cells and how it affects the progression of leukaemia.
