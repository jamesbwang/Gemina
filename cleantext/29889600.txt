  Strain DRP2-19 was detected to produce high yield of glucansucrase in MRS broth , which was identified to be Leuconostoc<pathogen> mesenteroides<pathogen>. In order for industrial glucansucrase production of L.<pathogen> mesenteroides<pathogen> DRP2-19 , a one-factor test was conducted , then response surface method was applied to optimize its yield and discover the best production condition. Based on Plackett-Burman ( PB) experiment , sucrose , Ca
