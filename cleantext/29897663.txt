  Nasal<symptom> congestion<symptom> and obstruction are reported in the majority of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) users and are frequently cited as reasons for noncompliance. To our knowledge , no study has demonstrated a change in objective or subjective nasal patency in patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) after a therapeutic trial of CPAP therapy. This prospective nonrandomized trial tested the hypothesis that CPAP therapy would result in both objective and subjective improvements in nasal patency in patients with OSA. Prior to initiation of CPAP , acoustic rhinometry ( AR) was used to determine nasal volume and minimum cross-sectional area in the upright and reclined positions. Subjective nasal patency was assessed with the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation ( NOSE) questionnaire. Both assessments were repeated at follow-up visits. AR data demonstrated a statistically significant increase in total nasal volume ( TV) in the reclined position ( p = 0.002) and minimum cross-sectional area ( MCA) in both the sitting and reclined positions ( p = 0.006 , p = 0.021) in OSA patients after > 30 days of CPAP therapy and with > 70 % compliance. NOSE scores decreased significantly ( p = 0.038) representing an improvement in nasal patency. Objective and subjective measurements of TV and MCA increased after initiation of CPAP therapy in this prospective study.
