  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) is an insidious , clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease associated with a diagnostic delay of approximately 12 months. No study conducted to date has analysed the diagnostic pathway in Spain. We gathered data on variables related to the diagnostic pathway and delay for patients diagnosed with ALS between October 2013 and July 2017. The study included 143 patients with ALS ( 57 % men; 68 % spinal onset). Patients were diagnosed in public centres in 86 % of cases and in private centres in 14 %. The mean diagnostic delay was 13.1 months ( median 11.7). Patients were examined by neurologists a mean time of 7.9 months after symptom onset , with diagnosis being made 5.2 months later. Half of all patients underwent unnecessary diagnostic tests and multiple electrophysiological studies before diagnosis was established. Diagnostic delay was longer in cases of spinal onset ( P = .008) due to onset of the disease in the lower limbs. No differences were found between the public and private healthcare systems ( P = .897). The diagnostic delay in ALS in Spain is similar to that of neighboring countries and seems to depend on disease-related factors , not on the healthcare system. Patients with lower-limb onset ALS constitute the greatest diagnostic challenge. Misdiagnosis is frequent , and partly attributable to an incorrect approach or erroneous interpretation of electrophysiological studies. Specific training programmes for neurologists and general neurophysiologists and early referral to reference centers may help to reduce diagnostic delay.
