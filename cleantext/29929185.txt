  This prospective observational clinical study investigated the benefits of spectral domain optical coherence tomography for specialists and residents in the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). The study involved 49 eyes of 44 patients. Patients were advised to present for reevaluation 4 weeks after the administration of the loading dose of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)- inhibitors ( 3 intravitreal injections every 4 weeks after diagnosis). They were examined by residents ( 3-4 years ' experience in ophthalmology) and specialists ( > 5 years ' experience). Each examiner evaluated the clinical situation and the spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT) scan. After each evaluation , the examiners independently stated if further anti-VEGF treatment was recommended. The `` true outcome '' was defined as the specialist decision based on clinical evaluation and SD-OCT. Specialists and residents did not significantly differ in their accuracy in deciding on the correct treatment ( p = 0.705 and p = 1) , with or without the aid of SD-OCT. Both groups benefited from using SD-OCT to support their recommendations ( p = 0.001 and p = 0.0002) and achieved a similar level of accuracy ( p = 1 for difference). Residents benefited more than specialists by using SD-OCT to substantiate their recommendation on how to manage exudative AMD after the administration of the loading dose.
