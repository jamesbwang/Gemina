  For effective self-directed life-long learning physicians need to engage in feedback-seeking , which means fostering such behavior during training. Self-determination theory ( SDT) posits that intrinsic motivation is fostered when the environment optimizes the individual 's experience of autonomy , relatedness , and competence. Educational settings meeting these psychological needs may foster intrinsic motivation in trainees , enhance their desire for feedback , and promote feedback-seeking. We sought to examine residents ' feedback-seeking behaviors through the lens of SDT and explore the association with intrinsic motivation and career choice. We used a mixed-methods approach with an explanatory sequential design. Residents participated in simulation training , completed an inventory of intrinsic motivation ( IMI) and responded to sequential opportunities for performance feedback requiring different levels of effort. We compared IMI scores and career choice between groups with different effort. We interviewed high-effort feedback-seekers and conducted thematic analysis of interview data. Thirty-four of 35 residents completed the survey ( 97 %). Of those completing the study , 12 engaged in low-effort feedback-seeking only , 10 indicated intent for high-effort feedback-seeking and 10 actually engaged in higher effort to get feedback. Groups did not differ in mean IMI scores. Among high-effort feedback-seekers more residents were interested in critical care-related fields compared to the other groups. We identified 5 themes around autonomy , relatedness , and competence clarifying residents ' reasons for feedback-seeking. Our findings suggest that among residents , the relationship between motivation and feedback-seeking is complex and can not be predicted by IMI score. Career plans and relationships with feedback providers impact feedback-seeking , which can inform educational interventions.
