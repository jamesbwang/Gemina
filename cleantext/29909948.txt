  The optimal revascularization strategy in patients with multi-vessel disease ( MVD) presenting with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) and cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( CS) remains unclear. To investigate the comparative differences between culprit-only revascularization ( COR) versus instant multi-vessel revascularization ( IMVR) in AMI and CS. 13 studies were selected using MEDLINE , EMBASE and the CENTRAL ( Inception- 31 November2017). Outcomes were assessed at short-term ( in-hospital or ≤ 30 days duration) and long-term duration ( ≥ 6 months). Estimates were reported as random effects relative risk ( RR) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI). In analysis of 7311 patients , COR significantly reduced the relative risk of short-term all-cause mortality ( RR: 0.87; 95 % CI , 0.77-0.97; p = 0.01 , I In MVD patients presenting with AMI and CS , IMVR was comparable to COR in terms of all-cause mortality at long term follow up duration. These results are predominantly derived from observational data and more randomized controlled trials are required to validate this impression.
