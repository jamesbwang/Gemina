  The mud sediments of the eastern China marginal seas ( ECMS) are deposited under different hydrodynamic conditions with different organic matter sources. These events have been demonstrated to exert significant influences on microbial communities and biogeochemical processes in surface sediments. However , the extent to which such effects occur in subsurface microbial communities remains unclear. In this study , both horizontal and vertical ( five sites , each for eight layers) distributions of bacterial abundance and community composition in mud deposits of the South Yellow Sea ( SYS) and East China Sea ( ECS) were investigated by quantitative PCR and Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Both bacterial abundance and diversity were higher in the ECS than in the SYS , and tended to be higher in up than in deep layers.
