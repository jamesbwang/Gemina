  Mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR) has been found to have significant health benefits in studies conducted in the global North. This study examined the effects of MBSR on stress , mood states and medical symptoms among urban South Africans to inform future research and clinical directions of MBSR in local settings. Participants completed an 8-week MBSR programme based in central Cape Town. A retrospective analysis of 276 clinical records was conducted. Mindfulness , stress , negative and positive mood , medical symptoms and psychological symptoms were assessed before and after the intervention using self-report questionnaires. We compared pre and postintervention scores and examined the relationship between changes in mindfulness and changes in stress , mood and medical symptoms. Mindfulness scores were significantly higher after intervention , both on the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills ( KIMS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ( MAAS). Changes on the KIMS were associated with reductions in stress , negative mood , psychological symptoms and total medical symptoms , and improvement in positive mood. Changes in mindfulness , as measured by the MAAS , were significantly correlated only with reduced total number of medical symptoms. This study provides preliminary evidence for the positive health impact of MBSR on urban South Africans , and in turn acceptability and feasibility evidence for MBSR in South Africa and supports the case for larger trials in different local settings.
