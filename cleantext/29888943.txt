  A primary way that people make sense of their experience is by comparing various objects within their immediate environment to each other and to previously encountered objects. The objects involved in a comparison can be stimuli that are present within one 's immediate environment , or mental representations of previously encountered stimuli that are now absent from one 's immediate environment. In this research , we propose that the comparison process unfolds differently depending on whether an individual is comparing stimuli that are simultaneously present within a given context or is comparing a target stimulus to a stored representation of a previously encountered source stimulus. Across two studies , we found that people engage in more abstract processing when comparing a present stimulus to a previously encountered source than when comparing two simultaneously present stimuli. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of abstraction in comparison and memory-based reasoning. ( PsycINFO Database Record
