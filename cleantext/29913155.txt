  Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 alpha ( PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Recently , mitochondrial dysfunction has been indicated as an established risk factor for the development of renal fibrosis<disease>. However , whether PGC-1α is involved in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis<disease> is unknown. In this study , we treated NRK-49F ( normal rat kidney fibroblast) cells with transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-β1) for 24 h to establish an in vitro fibrosis<disease> model. TGF-β1 induced the upregulation of type I collagen , fibronectin , TGF-β receptor I ( TGFβ-RI) , TGFβ-RII , Smad4 , and pSmad2/3 , as well as PGC-1α. NRK-49F cells transfected with pcDNA-PGC-1α showed significantly increased expression of fibronectin and type I collagen , as revealed by western blot assay. Interestingly , transfection with PGC-1α-siRNA caused a stark reversal of TGF-β1-induced cellular fibrosis<disease> , with concomitant suppression of fibronectin and type I collagen , as revealed by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Moreover , SB431542 ( TGFβ-RI) , LY294002 ( PI3K/Akt) , and SB203580 ( p38 MAPK) , inhibitors of TGF-β-associated pathways , markedly suppressed TGF-β1-induced PGC-1α upregulation. These results implicate a role of PGC-1α in renal interstitial fibrosis<disease> mediated via the TGFβ-RI , PI3K/Akt , and p38 MAPK pathways. Our findings that PGC-1α-siRNA downregulates fibronectin and type I collagen suggest that it can be used as a novel molecular treatment for renal
