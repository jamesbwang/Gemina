  As HER2 is frequently overexpressed in various malignancies , targeting HER2 is considered an efficient , highly selective antitumor therapy. HER2-targeted immunoconjugates are being developed and result in persistent remission of HER2-overexpressing tumors. However , many of the antibodies used as the targeting moiety are of murine origin and exhibit risk of inducing immunogenicity , limiting their antitumor therapeutic efficacy. Here , we humanized e23sFv , an HER2-targeting murine scFv with excellent affinity and specificity , using a human antibody consensus sequence engraftment strategy. The affinity of the initially humanized e23sFv was then rescued and improved by selective mutagenesis followed by phage-display-based affinity panning of the mutant pool. The resulting humanized e23sFv candidates ( husFvs) exhibited up-to-94-fold increased affinity to recombinant HER2. The immunogenicity of e23sFv was dramatically alleviated after humanization , as indicated by the impaired production of cytokines by husFv-stimulated human PBMCs. Two internalizable husFvs with optimal affinity were applied to generate humanized immunoapoptotins by infusion with the translocation domain Fdt and the proapoptotic domain truncated Bid. The husFv-immunoapoptotins demonstrated improved HER2-targeting and tumor-killing capacities in vitro and in vivo compared with the e23sFv-immunoapoptotins and would enable the administration of multiple treatment cycles to patients , resulting in improved antitumor efficacy. Furthermore , the husFvs recognized distinct HER2 epitopes and could thus be used in combination with trastuzumab or pertuzumab to achieve robust synergistic antitumor effects in HER2-positive malignancies.
