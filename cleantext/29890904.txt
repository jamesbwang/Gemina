  The study aims to evaluate the clinic feasibility of rapid parathyroid hormone ( PTH) detection and nano-carbon technology in preoperative diagnosis and localization of parathyroid adenoma. With the guidance of ultrasound , the operator performed the parathyroid puncture and tested the PTH value by using a PTH test kit , and then injected nano-carbon into parathyroid adenoma as a marker to observe whether the parathyroid adenoma was stained black during the final operation. Meanwhile , a part of excised specimen was made into homogenate and detected rapidly again by using the PTH test kit. The remaining was confirmed by intraoperative frozen pathological examination. The sensitivity ( 12/12) of preoperative diagnosis was significantly higher than that of ultrasound ( 6/12) , magnetic resonance imaging ( 7/12) , and MIBI ( 9/12). During the operation , we found that the inner part of the parathyroid adenoma was stained black , and the PTH value of the specimen homogenate confirmed as parathyroid adenoma was more than 3000 pg/mL. This novel technology , as a very positive method for localization of parathyroid adenoma , plays an important role in guaranteeing the surgical reliability of parathyroid adenoma with help of nano-carbon technology.
