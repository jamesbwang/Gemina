  Thyroid hormones are pleiotropic hormones involved in chordates physiology. Understanding their functions and mechanisms is also instrumental to diagnose dys-regulations and get a predictive power that can applied to medicine , ecology , etc.. Today , high-throughput sequencing technologies offer the opportunity to address this issue not only in model organisms but also in non-model organisms. Here , we describe a method that makes use of RNA-seq to address differential expression analysis in non-model organism.
