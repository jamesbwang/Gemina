  To detect the expression of Raf kinase inhibitory protein ( RKIP) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs) and to analyze its relationship with clinicopatholgical characteristics and prognosis of this disease. Sixty-three patients with pathologically diagnosed GISTs who underwent surgical resection at the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2011 to January 2015 and had complete clinical , pathological , and follow-up data were included. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of RKIP in GIST tissue samples from these patients. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the survival rate of 60 patients with complete follow-up data , and Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting the prognosis of patients GISTs to evaluate further the diagnostic and prognostic value of RKIP in GISTs. In GIST tissues , RKIP positive signals , manifesting as brownish yellow or brown granules , were located in the cytoplasm or on the membrane. Of 63 tissue samples included in this study , 34 ( 54 %) were positive and 29 ( 46 %) were negative for RKIP expression. Statistical analysis showed that RKIP expression in GISTs was significantly associated with tumor size , National Institutes of Health ( NIH) risk grade , and mucosal invasion , but had no significant association with age , gender , tumor location , or the number of mitotic figures. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the 1- , 3- , and 5-year survival rates were 94.4 % , 89.2 % , and 80.5 % for patients with positive RKIP expression , and 88.6 % , 68.2 % , and 48.2 % for patients with negative RKIP expression , suggesting that patients with high RKIP expression had significantly higher survival rates than those with low expression ( Log-rank test , This study demonstrated that: ( 1) RKIP expression in GISTs is associated with tumor size , NIH risk grade , and mucosal invasion , and low or no expression of RKIP predicts a high malignancy potential; ( 2) high RKIP correlates positively with the survival of patients with GISTs; and ( 3) RKIP expression has appreciated value for predicting the survival of patients with GISTs , although it is not an independent prognostic factor in GISTs.
