  In line with declining trends in dementia incidence , this work thus aimed to compare the cognitive and functional evolution of two `` generations '' separated by 10 years and to evaluate the impact of specific risk factors on this evolution. This study was conducted on two `` generations '' of elderly individuals aged 78-88 years , who were included 10 years apart in the Personnes Ag√©es QUID ( PAQUID) cohort ( France) ( n = 612 in 1991-92 and n = 628 in 2001-02) and followed-up for 12 years , with assessments of cognition and disability. Differences between the generations in baseline levels and decline over time were estimated using a joint model to account for differential attrition. Compared with the first generation , the second generation had higher performances at baseline on four cognitive tests ( from p < 0.005). Differences in global cognition , verbal fluency , and processing speed , but not in working memory were mostly explained by improvement in educational level. The second generation also exhibited less cognitive decline in verbal fluency and working memory. Regarding disability , we evidenced a lower progression over the follow-up period for the second generation compared to the first one. The cognitive state of this elderly population improved , partially due to improvements in educational level.
