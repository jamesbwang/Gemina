  The first stable anionic aluminium nucleophile was isolated by Goicoechea , Aldridge and co-workers. The aluminyl compound showed very high reactivity in metathesis reactions as well as in the oxidative addition of substrates such as dihydrogen and benzene , which opens up new perspectives in main group chemistry.
