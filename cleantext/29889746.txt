  The rate of gestational diabetes has doubled , and identifying the 30 % with persistent postpartum dysglycemia ( prediabetes or diabetes mellitus) is important because low-cost interventions have been proven to prevent overt diabetes mellitus , improve health for women , and potentially decrease the risk for birth defects in future pregnancies. Consensus guidelines continue to recommend a 4- to 12-week postpartum 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) despite persistent reports that only 35 % of women complete the test. Physician ordering rates can improve , but the largest barriers to postpartum testing are clearly patient-related. Initiatives to improve OGTT testing rates have been only moderately effective and required allocation of staff time , diverting resources from other clinical areas. Alternative testing models using single-draw tests that bypass patient barriers show promise for improving the diagnosis of postpregnancy dysglycemia. Specifically , evidence is emerging in the pregnant and nonpregnant populations that , compared with the OGTT , the single-draw hemoglobin A1C test may identify more patients with prediabetes , bypasses patient barriers to testing such as the need for fasting , and has less laboratory variation compared with the OGTT or fasting plasma glucose. The risk-benefit focus should shift from comparing individual test performance statistics presuming the OGTT to be the `` gold standard '' to data reporting the ability of a test to facilitate identification of patients. We review the evidence regarding postpregnancy testing and make recommendations for strategies to improve the identification of dysglycemia and postpregnancy health.
