  There is a diverse class of peripheral membrane-binding proteins that specifically bind phosphatidylserine ( PS) , a lipid that signals apoptosis or cell fusion depending on the membrane context of its presentation. PS-receptors are specialized for particular PS-presenting pathways , indicating that they might be sensitive to the membrane context. In this review , we describe a combination of thermodynamic , structural , and computational techniques that can be used to investigate the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity. As an example , we focus on three PS-receptors of the T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin containing ( TIM) protein family , which we have previously shown to differ in their sensitivity to PS surface density.
