  Teratomas are rare congenital tumors typically comprising all 3 germ cell layers. Cervical teratomas arise in the neck and represent a minority of all teratomas. These are associated with high morbidity and mortality because of their propensity to cause airway obstruction. Demonstration on prenatal magnetic resonance imaging is uncommon , especially for a tumor of this size. Fetuses diagnosed with large neck masses are managed through cesarean section with the ex utero intrapartum treatment procedure to secure the airway , such as in our case of a large cervical teratoma in the female fetus of a 30-year-old mother who went into preterm labor.
