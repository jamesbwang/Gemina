  Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders ( NMOSD) are inflammatory conditions of the central nervous system and an important differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis ( MS). Unlike MS , the course is usually relapsing , and it is unclear , if progressive neurodegeneration contributes to disability. Therefore , we aimed to investigate if progressive retinal neuroaxonal damage occurs in aquaporin4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD. Out of 157 patients with NMOSD screened , 94 eyes of 51 patients without optic neuritis ( ON) during follow-up ( F/U) and 56 eyes of 28 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls ( HC) were included ( median F/U 2.3 years). The NMOSD cohort included 60 eyes without ( Eye At baseline , GCIP , FT and TMV were reduced in Eye This study clearly shows GCIP loss independent of ON attacks in aquaporin4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD. Potential explanations for progressive GCIP thinning include primary retinopathy , drug-induced neurodegeneration and retrograde neuroaxonal degeneration from lesions<symptom> or optic neuropathy. pRNFL thickening in the patients presenting with attacks during F/U might be indicative of pRNFL susceptibility to
