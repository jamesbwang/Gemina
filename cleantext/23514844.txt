  Clinical trials had provided evidence for the benefit effect of antihypertensive treatments in preventing future cardiovascular disease ( CVD) events; however , the association between hypertension , whether treated/untreated or controlled/uncontrolled and risk of mortality in US population has been poorly understood. A total of 13,947 US adults aged â‰¥ 18 years enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( 1988-1994) were used to conduct this study. Mortality outcome events included all-cause , CVD-specific , heart disease-specific and cerebrovascular disease-specific deaths , which were obtained from linked 2011 National Death Index ( NDI) files. During a median follow-up of 19.1 years , there were 3,550 all-cause deaths , including 1,027 CVD deaths. Compared with normotensives , treated but uncontrolled hypertensive patients were at higher risk of all-cause ( HR = 1.62 , 95 % CI = 1.35-1.95) , CVD-specific ( HR = 2.23 , 95 % CI = 1.66-2.99) , heart disease-specific ( HR = 2.19 , 95 % CI = 1.57-3.05) and cerebrovascular disease-specific ( HR = 3.01 , 95 % CI = 1.91-4.73) mortality. Additionally , untreated hypertensive patients had increased risk of all-cause ( HR = 1.40 , 95 % CI = 1.21-1.62) , CVD-specific ( HR = 1.77 , 95 % CI = 1.34-2.35) , heart disease-specific ( HR = 1.69 , 95 % CI = 1.23-2.32) and cerebrovascular disease-specific death ( HR = 2.53 , 95 % CI = 1.52-4.23). No significant differences were identified between normotensives , and treated and controlled hypertensives ( all p > 0.05). Our study findings emphasize the benefit of secondary prevention in hypertensive patients and primary prevention in general population to prevent risk of mortality later in life.
