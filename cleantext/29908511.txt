  Metal oxide-Carbon composites have been developed tailoring towards specific functionalities for removing pollutants from contaminated environmental systems. In this study , we synthesized a novel CaO-MgO hybrid carbon composite for removal of phosphate and humate by co-pyrolysis of dolomite and sawdust at various temperatures. Increasing of pyrolysis temperature to 900 °C generated a composite rich in carbon , CaO and MgO particles. Phosphate and humate can be removed efficiently by the synthesized composite with the initial solution in the range of pH 3.0-11.0. The phosphate adsorption was best fitted by pseudo-second-order kinetic model , while the humate adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order and the intra-particle diffusion kinetic models. The maximum adsorption capabilities quantified by the Langmuir isotherm model were up to 207 mg phosphorus ( or 621 mg phosphate) and 469 mg humate per one-gram composite used , respectively. Characterization of composites after adsorption revealed the contributions of phosphate crystal deposition and electrostatic attraction on the phosphate uptake and involvement of π- π interaction in the humate adsorption. The prepared composite has great potential for recovering phosphorus from wastewater , and the phosphate sorbed composite can be employed as a promising phosphorus slow-releasing fertilizer for improving plant growth.
