  The absorbed dose rate is the main characterization quantity for beta radiation. The extrapolation chamber is considered the primary standard instrument. To determine absorbed dose rates in beta radiation beams , it is necessary to establish several correction factors. In this work , the correction factors for the backscatter due to the collecting electrode and to the guard ring , and the correction factor for Bremsstrahlung in beta secondary standard radiation beams are presented. For this purpose , the Monte Carlo method was applied. The results obtained are considered acceptable , and they agree within the uncertainties. The differences between the backscatter factors determined by the Monte Carlo method and those of the ISO standard were 0.6 % , 0.9 % and 2.04 % for
