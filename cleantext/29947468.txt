  Phospholipid nanodiscs are a native-like membrane mimetic that is suitable for structural studies of membrane proteins. Although nanodiscs of different sizes exist for various structural applications , their thermal and long-term stability can vary considerably. Covalently circularized nanodiscs are a perfect tool to overcome these limitations. Existing methods for the production of circularized nanodiscs can be time-consuming and technically demanding. Therefore , an easy in vivo approach , in which circularized membrane scaffold proteins ( MSPs) can be directly obtained from Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> culture , is reported herein. Nostoc punctiforme DnaE split-intein fusions with MSPs of various lengths are used and consistently provide circularized nanodiscs in high yields. With this approach , a large variety of circularized nanodiscs , ranging from 7 to 26 nm in diameter , that are suitable for NMR spectroscopy and electron microscopy ( EM) applications can be prepared. These nanodiscs are superior to those of the corresponding linear versions in terms of stability and size homogeneity , which affects the quality of NMR spectroscopy data and EM experiments. Due to their long-term stability and homogeneity , the presented small circular nanodiscs are suited for high-resolution NMR spectroscopy studies , as demonstrated with two membrane proteins of 17 or 32 kDa in size. The presented method will provide easy access to circularized nanodiscs for structural studies of membrane proteins and for applications in which a defined and stable nanodisc size is required.
