  Cell density in tumor cell three dimensional ( 3D) cultures affects secretome expression of components. A microenvironment characteristic shared by high-density 3D cell culture and in vivo tumor masses is poor oxygenation , with anoxia being a natural cell state in tumor centers. Until recently , the ability to study anoxia-adapted cell physiology was not possible. Using a newly-developed methodology , anoxic HeLa cell secretome expression was measured. Anoxic HeLa cell cytokine levels after 3 days ' ( hypoxia inducible factor , HIF1 positive) and 10 days ' growth ( HIF1 negative; anaerobic respiration<symptom>) were significantly ( p < 0.01) higher than normoxic controls for: IL-8 ( 1.8- and 3.4-fold higher , respectively) , GRO ( 1.3- and 1.1-fold higher , respectively) , and IL-11 ( 1.4- and 1.1-fold higher , respectively). In contrast , G-CSF , IFNÎ±2 , and CXCL-10 levels decreased over time ( day 3 vs. day 10). Thus , metabolically active HeLa cells respond to the lack of oxygen , in part , by regulating the levels of cytokines produced. Cytokines expressed at increased levels , in the absence of oxygen , correspond to a secretomic profile reported for paracrine signaling pathways associated with metastasis. Further studies defining physiologic changes that occur upon anoxic growth may lead to the discovery of novel chemotherapeutic drug targets.
