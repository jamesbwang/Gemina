  Growing evidence suggests that non-communicable diseases ( NCDs) result in considerable economic burden for individuals and households. With the poor facing a greater burden of NCDs than the rich in India , we undertook this study to analyse the horizontal equity in utilization and vertical equity in out-of-pocket expenditure for NCD care. We used data of 1 4 large Indian states from the National Sample Survey 60th round to compute hospitalization rates for NCDs. Mean per capita consumption expenditure ( MPCE) was computed and used as a proxy measure for socioeconomic status. Out-of-pocket payment as a proportion of MPCE was estimated by wealth quintile ( Q) to assess the vertical equity in payments. Concentration index ( CoI) was computed to measure the extent of equity , and its 95 % confidence interval was estimated to assess statistical significance. Overall , NCD hospitalizations in public facilities in India were used more by the poor ( Col<pathogen> -0.041) , while the rich used proportionately more services in the private sector ( CoI 0.174). Out-of-pocket expenditure in public facilities was consistently lower than that in private facilities in urban and rural areas. The mean out-of-pocket expenditure for inpatient services for NCDs was found to be more among the rich in both public ( Q5 $ 13 016 , Q1 $ 4197) and private ( Q5 $ 22 974 , Q1 $ 8225) facilities. Public facilities are utilized more by poorer individuals. Strengthening the capacity of the public sector to deliver NCD care is required to meet equitable outcomes.
