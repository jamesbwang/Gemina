  Patulin ( PAT) , deoxynivalenol ( DON) and toxin T-2 ( T-2) are mycotoxins distributed worldwide in food and feed. Cytotoxicity of the three mycotoxins individually or in combination in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HepG2) cells was evaluated by MTT assay over 24 , 48 and 72 h of exposure. The concentration ranges used were 0.625-15 μM for DON , 1.25-50 nM for T-2 and 0.45-7.5 μM for PAT. The IC
