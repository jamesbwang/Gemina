  This study aimed to analyze the effects of a pyramid system performed with two repetition zones on muscular strength and skeletal muscle mass ( SMM) in older women. Thirty-nine physically independent older women ( 67.8 Â± 5.4 years) were randomly assigned into one of two of groups that performed an 8-week resistance training program in an ascending pyramid fashion. Both groups performed 3 sets: a narrow repetition zone ( NPR , n = 20) with 12/10/8 repetitions , and a wide repetition zone ( WPR , n = 19) with 15/10/5 repetitions. The program consisted of 8 whole-body exercises , performed 3 times a week. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure SMM , and muscular strength was evaluated by one-repetition maximum ( 1RM). Both groups increased ( P < 0.05) SMM ( NPR = + 4.7 % , effect size = + 0.34; WPR = + 8.4 % , effect size = + 0.77) , and total strength ( NPR = + 11.3 % , effect size = + 0.80; WPR = + 13.8 % , effect size = 0.84) , without statistical differences between them. Results suggest that both zones of repetitions in a pyramid system are effective strategies to improve muscular strength and muscle growth in older women.
