  The delicate balance<symptom> of excitation and inhibition is crucial for proper function of the cerebral cortex , relying on the accurate number and subtype composition of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric ( GABA)- expressing interneurons. Various intrinsic and extrinsic factors precisely orchestrate their multifaceted development including the long-range migration from the basal telencephalon to cortical targets as well as interneuron survival throughout the developmental period. Particularly expressed guidance receptors were described to channel the migration of cortical interneurons deriving from the medial ganglionic eminence ( MGE) and the preoptic area ( POA) along distinct routes. Hence , unveiling the regulatory genetic networks controlling subtype-specific gene expression profiles is key to understand interneuron-specific developmental programs and to reveal causes for associated disorders. In contrast to MGE-derived interneurons , little is known about the transcriptional networks in interneurons born in the POA. Here , we provide first evidence for the LIM-homeobox transcription factor LHX1 as a crucial key player in the post-mitotic development of POA-derived cortical interneurons. By transcriptional regulation of related genes , LHX1 modulates their survival as well as the subtype-specific expression of guidance receptors of the Eph/ephrin family , thereby affecting directional migration and layer distribution in the adult cortex.
