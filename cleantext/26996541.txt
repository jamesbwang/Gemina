  Objective The objective of our study was to determine whether cadaveric dissection is a necessity in medical education. Another purpose of our study was to assess the attitude and perception of consultants , residents , and fellows about cadaveric dissection and whether it helped them in their medical practices. Method We performed an analytical cross-sectional study among consultants , fellows , and residents of different specialty areas practicing in Punjab. A self-constructed questionnaire compromising of 41 items was used to assess the perception of doctors about cadaveric dissection and other alternative anatomy teaching methods. Consultants , fellows , and residents who were in clinical practice for more than six months were included in the study. Results Out of the total sample size of 842 , 44.7 % were female medical doctors and 55.3 % were male medical doctors. Cadaveric dissection was thought to be the most effective method for teaching anatomy by 27.9 % of the doctors. Mean cadaveric dissection , prosection and didactic teaching components were scored significantly higher by doctors in surgery and allied fields ( p < 0.001). Doctors in the surgical and allied field were 0.55 times less likely to think that cadaveric dissection was unethical as compared to doctors working in medicine and allied fields ( p < 0.001). Conclusion Dissection is still considered by several doctors as a valuable source of learning anatomy. However , the future of teaching anatomy does not depend on any single method. It is , in fact , the right combination of all available resources and using them in an interactive way that maximizes outcomes.
