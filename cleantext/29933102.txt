  Most tumor-associated proteins are located inside tumor cells and thus are not accessible to current marketed therapeutic monoclonal antibodies or their cytotoxic conjugates. Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) class I can present peptides derived from intracellular tumor-associated proteins and somatically mutated proteins on the cell 's surface , forming an HLA/peptide complex as tumor-specific antigens for T cell receptor ( TCR) recognition. Therefore , HLA-mediated presentation of intracellular tumor antigen peptides provides a viable way to distinguish tumor cells from normal cells , which is important for broadening antigen selection , especially for antibody-drug conjugates ( ADCs) regarding their highly cytotoxic payload. We applied sortase A-mediated conjugation to develop TCR-like ADCs ( i.e. , EA1 HL-vcMMAE) targeting intracellular MART-1 protein , a melanocyte-differentiating antigen specific for metastatic melanomas , via the cell surface HLA-A2/ MART-1
