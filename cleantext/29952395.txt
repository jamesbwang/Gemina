  The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with syphilis<disease> in homeless men in Central Brazil. It is a cross-sectional study conducted with 481 individuals attending four therapeutic communities between October and December 2015. A structured interview was conducted to collect sociodemographic data and risk factors for syphilis<disease> Rapid/point-of-care and VDRL tests were performed to determine exposure to syphilis<disease> and the presence of active syphilis<disease> , respectively. Poisson regression analysis was used to verify the risk factors associated with the outcomes investigated. Of the study participants , 10.2 % were reactive to the rapid test , and 5.4 % had active syphilis<disease> At the multiple regression analysis , schooling ( adjusted prevalence ratio- APR: 0.89; p = 0.005) , history of genital ulcer<disease> ( APR: 2.59; p = 0.002) , STI history ( APR: 1.97; p = 0.042) , and sexual intercourse under drug effects ( APR: 1.60; p = 0.022) were independent factors associated with lifetime syphilis<disease> Also , history of genital ulcer<disease> ( APR: 2.19; p = 0.019) , STI history ( APR: 1.74; p = 0.033) and number of sexual partners in the last year ( APR: 1.02; p = 0.044) were associated with active syphilis<disease> The prevalence of syphilis<disease> among homeless men was rather high , confirming the vulnerability of this group to this infection. These results emphasize the need for educational intervention , improvement of risk reduction programs , availability of diagnostic tests , especially the rapid test , and treatment.
