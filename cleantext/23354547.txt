  Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1B ( JARID1B) has been revealed to remove methyl residues from methylated lysine 4 on histone H3 ( H3K4) and has also been reported to be associated with the progression of numerous types of tumor. However , its roles and mechanisms in pancreatic cancer ( PC) remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that JARID1B is elevated in PC and is associated with the growth of pancreatic tumors. Overexpression of JARID1B significantly promoted the proliferation
