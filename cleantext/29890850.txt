  The National Standard of Canada for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace ( the Standard) was released in 2013. The objectives of this study were to 1) estimate the proportion of Canadian employers who were aware of the Standard , 2) examine the extent to which the Standard has been implemented , and 3) describe perceived barriers to implementing the Standard in Canadian organizations. A cross-sectional survey in Canadian employers was conducted between February 2015 and January 2017. A random sample of Canadian employers was selected , and the individuals who were knowledgeable about the occupational health policies of the organizations were interviewed by telephone. The participants answered questions about the awareness , implementation , perceived effects , and barriers to implementation. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to characterize the results. A total of 1010 companies participated in the study. Overall , 17.0 % reported that they were aware of the Standard; 1.7 % and 20.3 % reported that their organizations had implemented the entirety or elements of the Standard , respectively; and 71.4 % of participants believed that elements of the Standard would be implemented within the next year. The perceived effects associated with implementation of the Standard included increased job satisfaction and employee retention while the greatest barrier to implementing the Standard was the belief that psychological health and safety are irrelevant in the workplace. Many Canadian employers are still unaware of the Standard 's existence; however , most Canadian employers are positively inclined toward the Standard in its potential to help employee productivity and job satisfaction.
