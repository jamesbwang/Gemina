  The nervous system is vulnerable to intrinsic and extrinsic metabolic perturbations. In particular , the cerebellum , with its large Purkinje cells and its high density of neurons and glial cells , has high metabolic demand and is highly vulnerable to metabolic derangements. As a result , many disorders of intermediary metabolism will preferentially and sometimes selectively target the cerebellum. However , many of these disorders present in a multisystem fashion with ataxia<symptom> being a part of the neurologic symptom complex. The presentation of these disorders depends on the time of onset and type of metabolic derangement. Early infantile or intrauterine-onset diseases will present in a young child typically with global hypotonia and both nystagmus<symptom> and ataxia<symptom> become more apparent later in life , while later-onset diseases usually present primarily with ataxia<symptom> It is important to note that the majority of these disorders are progressive if they are untreated. This chapter provides a review of acquired and genetic metabolic disorders that target the cerebellum , and discusses their diagnostic evaluation and therapy.
