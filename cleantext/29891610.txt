  Doravirine is a novel nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in development for use with other antiretroviral therapies to treat human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> type 1 ( HIV-1) infection. Doravirine metabolism predominantly occurs via cytochrome P450 3A with < 10 % of elimination occurring via the renal pathway. As severe renal impairment can alter the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of metabolically eliminated drugs , the effect of severe renal impairment on doravirine PK was assessed. A single dose of doravirine 100 mg was administered to subjects aged 18 to 75 years with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) of < 30 ml/min/1 .73 m
