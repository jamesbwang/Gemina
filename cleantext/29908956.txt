  Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) is a potentially fatal condition , being a major cause of death worldwide. Ischemia suffered during AMI causes tissue damage , leading to an inflammatory process. Moreover , myocardial injury can generate damage-associated molecular patterns that activate pattern recognition molecules including some complement proteins. Here we investigated products of complement activation , C3d and soluble C5b9 ( sC5b9) , as potential biomarkers for myocardial injury and inflammation<symptom> , as well as serum cytokines ( IL-6 and TNF-alpha) , alpha-1-acid glycoprotein ( AGP) , and classical markers of myocardial necrosis<symptom> ( creatine kinase , creatine kinase-MB isoform , myoglobin and troponin-I) in a longitudinal study of patients with AMI ( from admission , 6 h and 12 h post admission , and at discharge from hospital). Individuals undergoing cardiac catheterization ( CC) with normal coronary arteries and asymptomatics with no history of cardiovascular disease or invasive procedures were included as controls. Plasma C3d was higher in AMI at admission , 6 h , 12 h , and discharge vs CC ( p < 0.0001; p = 0.0061; p = 0.0081; p = 0.044) and asymptomatic ( p = 0.0001 for admission , 6 h and 12 h; p = 0.0002 for discharge). Moreover , sC5b9 was higher only at admission and 6 h vs asymptomatic ( p = 0.0031 and p = 0.0019). Additionally , AGP levels were elevated at admission , 6 h , 12 h , and discharge vs asymptomatic ( p = 0.0003; p = 0.0289; p = 0.0009 , p = 0.0017). IL-6 concentration was low at admission and 6 h and reached a peak at 12 h ( p < 0.0001 for all groups). All classical markers of myocardial necrosis<symptom> presented higher concentration at 6 h. Our results showed that complement activation is an early event in AMI occurring before the elevation of classical markers of myocardial necrosis<symptom> such as creatine kinase , creatine kinase-MB isoform , myoglobin and troponin-I. These findings indicated C3d and sC5b9 as possible biomarkers for inflammation<symptom> and tissue damage in AMI.
