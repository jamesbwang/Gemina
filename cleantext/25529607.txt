  The Laboratory of the Neuropsychology and Cognitive Neurosciences Research Center ( CINPSI Neurocog) , located in the `` Technological Park '' building of the Catholic University of Maule -LRB- Universidad Cat√≥lica del Maule , UCM) campus in Talca , Chile , has been established as `` Psychology Lab '' recently in July , 2016. Our lines of work include basic and applied research. Among the basic research , we study executive functions , decision-making , and spatial cognition. In the applied field , we have studied neuropsychological and neurobehavioral effects of pesticides exposure , among other interests. One of our aims is to develop collaboration both national and internationally. It is important to mention that to date there are only few psychology laboratories and research centers in Chile involved with the fields of neuropsychology and neurosciences. Thus , this scientific effort could be a groundbreaking initiative to develop specific knowledge in this area locally and interculturally through its international collaborations.
