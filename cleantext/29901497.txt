  Major depressive disorder is a severe , refractory mental disorder. Only one third of patients treated with antidepressants achieve remission after 3 trials , while subject to adverse effects. Therefore , the investigation of alternative treatments is paramount. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the most recent evidence of transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) intervention for the acute phase of major depressive disorder. A PubMed search was performed including the terms `` transcranial direct current stimulation '' OR `` transcranial direct stimulation '' OR `` tDCS '' AND `` major depressive disorder '' OR `` major depression<symptom> '' OR `` depression<symptom> '' AND `` trial. '' The search was conducted from inception until February 2018. Our search yielded initially 165 results , and 14 randomized clinical trials were included according to eligibility criteria. Most studies were pilot studies , with mixed findings. Two large randomized clinical trials recently published also presented primary negative findings. Study protocols usually used anodal left/cathodal right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation , 1 to 2.5 mA , and 5 to 20 tDCS sessions. We discuss the limitations of the included trials , such as sample and tDCS parameters heterogeneity between studies. To conclude , tDCS seems to be safe and devoid of serious adverse effects , although robust efficacy has not been consistently demonstrated in clinical trials assessing an acute treatment course of up to 4 weeks. Further directions are discussed , such as parameter individualization , investigation of biological markers , and home-use tDCS.
