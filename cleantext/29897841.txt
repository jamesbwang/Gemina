  In efficacy trials of a tetravalent dengue<disease> vaccine ( CYD-TDV) , excess hospitalizations for dengue<disease> were observed among vaccine recipients 2 to 5 years of age. Precise risk estimates according to observed dengue serostatus could not be ascertained because of the limited numbers of samples collected at baseline. We developed a dengue anti-nonstructural protein 1 ( NS1) IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and used samples from month 13 to infer serostatus for a post hoc analysis of safety and efficacy. In a case-cohort study , we reanalyzed data from three efficacy trials. For the principal analyses , we used baseline serostatus determined on the basis of measured ( when baseline values were available) or imputed ( when baseline values were missing) titers from a 50 % plaque-reduction neutralization test ( PRNT Among dengue-seronegative participants 2 to 16 years of age , the cumulative 5-year incidence of hospitalization for VCD was 3.06 % among vaccine recipients and 1.87 % among controls , with a hazard ratio ( vaccine vs. control) through data cutoff of 1.75 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.14 to 2.70). Among dengue-seronegative participants 9 to 16 years of age , the cumulative incidence of hospitalization for VCD was 1.57 % among vaccine recipients and 1.09 % among controls , with a hazard ratio of 1.41 ( 95 % CI , 0.74 to 2.68). Similar trends toward a higher risk among seronegative vaccine recipients than among seronegative controls were also found for severe VCD. Among dengue-seropositive participants 2 to 16 years of age and those 9 to 16 years of age , the cumulative incidence of hospitalization for VCD was 0.75 % and 0.38 % , respectively , among vaccine recipients and 2.47 % and 1.88 % among controls , with hazard ratios of 0.32 ( 95 % CI , 0.23 to 0.45) and 0.21 ( 95 % CI , 0.14 to 0.31). The risk of severe VCD was also lower among seropositive vaccine recipients than among seropositive controls. CYD-TDV protected against severe VCD and hospitalization for VCD for 5 years in persons who had exposure to dengue<disease> before vaccination , and there was evidence of a higher risk of these outcomes in vaccinated persons who had not been exposed to dengue.
