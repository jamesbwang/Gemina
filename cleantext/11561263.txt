  Ultrasonography ( USG)- guided transversus abdominis plane ( TAP) block is an abdominal field block with high efficacy. This study was undertaken with the aim of determining the effect of the addition of dexamethasone to 0.5 % ropivacaine on post-operative analgesia in USG-guided TAP block for inguinal hernia repair. A double-blind randomised control study was conducted on sixty patients posted for inguinal hernia repair with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I or II , who were allocated two groups of 30 each. Patients in Group RS received 0.5 % ropivacaine ( 20 ml) and normal saline ( 2 ml) whereas patients in Group RD received 0.5 % ropivacaine ( 20 ml) and dexamethasone ( 2 ml , i.e. , 8 mg) , in USG-guided TAP Block on the same side , after repair of inguinal hernia under spinal anaesthesia. Visual analogue scale ( VAS) scores , time for request of first analgesia and total tramadol consumption in first 24 h were compared. Unpaired Student 's Patients in Group RD had significantly lower VAS scores as compared to Group RS from 4 Addition of dexamethasone to ropivacaine in USG-guided TAP block significantly reduces post-operative pain and prolongs the duration of post-operative analgesia , thereby reducing analgesic consumption.
