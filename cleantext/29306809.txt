  Data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled `` Near Infra-red spectroscopy quantitative modelling of bivalve protein , lipid and glycogen composition using single-species versus multi-species calibration and validation sets '' ( 1). Band width selections were determined using a data-driven approach to modelling Near Infra-red Spectra ( NIRS) of protein , lipid and glycogen content in bivalves. Models were produced for single species and combined species of
