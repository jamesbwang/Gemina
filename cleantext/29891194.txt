  Medicare 's 2011 prospective payment system ( PPS) was introduced to curb overuse of separately billable injectable drugs. After epoietin , intravenous ( IV) vitamin D analogues are the biggest drug cost drivers in hemodialysis ( HD) patients , but the association between PPS introduction and vitamin D therapy has been scarcely investigated. Interrupted time-series analyses. Adult US HD patients represented in the US Renal Data System between 2008 and 2013. PPS implementation. The cumulative dose of IV vitamin D analogues ( paricalcitol equivalents) per patient per calendar quarter in prevalent HD patients. The average starting dose of IV vitamin D analogues and quarterly rates of new vitamin D use ( initiations/100 person-months) in incident HD patients within 90 days of beginning HD therapy. Segmented linear regression models of the immediate change and slope change over time of vitamin D use after PPS implementation. Among 359,600 prevalent HD patients , IV vitamin D analogues accounted for 99 % of the total use , and this trend was unchanged over time. PPS resulted in an immediate 7 % decline in the average dose of IV vitamin D analogues ( average baseline dose = 186.5 μg per quarter; immediate change = -13.5 μg ( P < 0.001); slope change = 0.43 per quarter ( P = 0.3)) and in the starting dose of IV vitamin D analogues in incident HD patients ( average baseline starting dose = 5.22 μg; immediate change = -0.40 μg ( P < 0.001); slope change = -0.03 per quarter ( P = 0.03)). The baseline rate of vitamin D therapy initiation among 99,970 incident HD patients was 44.9/ 100 person-months and decreased over time , even before PPS implementation ( pre-PPS β = -0.46/ 100 person-months ( P < 0.001); slope change = -0.19/ 100 person-months ( P = 0.2)). PPS implementation was associated with an immediate change in initiation levels ( by -4.5/ 100 person-months; P < 0.001). Incident HD patients were restricted to those 65 years or older. PPS implementation was associated with a 7 % reduction in the average dose and starting dose of IV vitamin D analogues and a 10 % reduction in the rate of vitamin D therapy initiation.
