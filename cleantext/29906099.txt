  α-Synuclein ( α-Syn) aggregation and amyloid formation are associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson 's disease ( PD). In addition , familial mutations in α-Syn are shown to be one of the definite causes of PD. Here we have extensively studied familial PD associated α-Syn G51D , H50Q , and E46K mutations using Drosophila model system. Our data showed that flies expressing α-Syn familial mutants have a shorter lifespan and exhibit more climbing defects compared to wild-type ( WT) flies in an age-dependent manner. The immunofluorescence studies of the brain from the old flies showed more dopaminergic neuronal cell death in all mutants compared to WT. This adverse effect of α-Syn familial mutations is highly correlated with the sustained population of oligomer production and retention in mutant flies. Furthermore , this was supported by our in vitro studies , where significantly higher amount of oligomer was observed in mutants compared to WT. The data suggest that the sustained population of oligomer formation and retention could be a major cause of cell death in α-Syn familial mutants.
