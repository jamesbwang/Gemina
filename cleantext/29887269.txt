  Setting dialysate sodium allows to adequately adjust sodium balance<symptom> and plasma sodium at the end of dialysis session. In accordance with the set-point theory based on the concept of restoring cellular hydration , an adequate target for plasma sodium at the end of the session could be the value of predialysis plasma sodium concentration ( isonatric hemodialysis). Some recently available dialysis monitors provide an on-line value of plasma-water conductivity usually converted in on-line natremia. There are different modalities of isonatric hemodialysis depending on whether the online value of natremia is used or not. By reviewing the few studies concerning the isonatric hemodialysis , it seems logical to set a target of postdialysis on-line natremia ( or plasma-water conductivity) slightly lower than its predialysis value. However this strategy requires specifically designed software not yet available in clinical routine.
