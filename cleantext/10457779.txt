  Cervical lordosis has important clinical and surgical implications. Cervical spine curvature is reported with considerable variability in individual studies. The aim of this study was to examine the existence and extent of cervical lordosis in asymptomatic individuals and to evaluate its relationship with age and gender. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in several electronic databases. Study selection was based on pre-determined eligibility criteria. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic individuals with lordosis and the effect size of cervical lordotic curvature in these individuals which followed metaregression analysis to examine the factors affecting cervical lordosis. Data from 21 studies ( 15,364 asymptomatic individuals , age 42.30 years ( 95 % confidence interval 36.42 , 48.18) , 54.2 % males) were used in the present study. In this population , 63.99 % ( 95 % confidence interval 44.94 , 83.03) individuals possessed lordotic curvature. Degree of lordotic curvature differed by method of measurement; 12.71 ° ( 6.59 , 18.84) with Cobb C2-C7 method and 18.55 ° ( 14.48 , 22.63) with posterior tangent method. Lordotic curvature was not significantly different between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals but was significantly higher in males in comparison with females. Age was not significantly associated with lordotic cervical curvature. Majority of the asymptomatic individuals possesses lordotic cervical curvature which is higher in males than in females but have no relationship with age or symptoms.
