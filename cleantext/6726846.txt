  Pigmented villonodular synovitis<symptom> is a benign but locally aggressive extra-articular tumor arising from the synovial membrane of tendons and bursae occurring near a joint space. Rarely , pigmented villonodular synovitis<symptom> can involve the temporomandibular joint , which is emphasized in this paper. Diffuse and localized types have been described in the literature. The diffuse type involves the entire synovial membrane and infiltrates adjacent structures , which tend to be more aggressive and associated with a higher rate of recurrence when compared with the localized type.
