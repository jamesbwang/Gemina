  The neonatal skeletal outcomes due to maternal Vitamin D deficiency. The aim of this study is to assess the serum 25 hydroxy Vitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D status in pregnant women and correlate with cord blood 25 ( OH) D levels , femur length at 34 weeks gestation , and neonatal anthropometry ( birth weight , birth length , and head circumference). This was prospective cohort study. This study was carried out in 250 healthy primigravida between 18 and 40 years of age in the third trimester of gestation attending the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of Gauhati Medical College , Guwahati from December 2012 to December 2015. Dietary assessment of calcium and Vitamin D intake , sunlight exposure among the pregnant mothers and fetal femur length measurements were done. The neonates were followed up at birth for biometric assessment and the estimation of cord 25 ( OH) D. Chi-square test and Pearson correlation were carried out to see the association and correlation between different variables. Statistical significance was set at the 0.05 level. We found low Vitamin D levels ( 60 %) in the majority of pregnant mothers and newborns ( 62.4 %). The mean Vitamin D levels were 17.51 ± 2.24 ng/ml and 14.51 ± 1.8 ng/ml among the low Vitamin D maternal subjects and their new born , respectively. There was a significant association of maternal Vitamin D levels with sun exposure , dietary intake of Vitamin D , serum calcium , serum alkaline phosphatase levels , and serum parathyroid hormone in subjects with low Vitamin D. Fetal femur length and birth length were significantly shorter in mothers with low Vitamin D ( Maternal hypovitaminosis D was associated with adverse skeletal outcome in neonates.
