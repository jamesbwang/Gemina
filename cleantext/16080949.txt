  Splenogonadal fusion is a rare and benign condition. Diagnosis is challenging for clinicians. Despite its indolence , diagnosis is often confirmed after orchidectomy. Surgery is mandatory , particularly to rule out the extremely rare association with malignancy. We report a case of splenogonadal fusion in a 38-year-old North African man presenting a palpable scrotal mass. We describe clinical aspects , pathogenic hypothesis , radiological features , as well as surgical management principles. Splenogonadal fusion is rarely suspected and diagnosed preoperatively. A diagnosis is made once an ectopic testicular mass is associated with cryptorchidism and suggestive radiological signs. A better knowledge of the clinical and radiological features of splenogonadal fusion provides an opportunity for conservative surgery.
