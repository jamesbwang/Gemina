Data were collected through interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. The Chi-square test , The prevalence of self-medication was 34.8 % in the pregnant and 77.1 % in the nonpregnant women. The age group in which the most frequent instances of self-medication were observed ( 53.4 %) was the 21-30 age group in the pregnant women and the 31-40 age group ( 44.4 %) in the nonpregnant women , suggesting a statistically significant intergroup difference in terms of age ( As medicinal plants are the most common medications used by pregnant women and since assessing the risk of herbal substances is difficult , pregnant women should be advised against the arbitrary use of these substances.
