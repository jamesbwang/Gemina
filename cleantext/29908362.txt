  Magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE) and transient elastography ( TE) are noninvasive techniques for detection of liver fibrosis<disease>. Single-center studies have compared the diagnostic performance of MRE vs TE in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). We conducted a pooled analysis of individual participant data from published studies to compare the diagnostic performance of MRE vs TE for staging of liver fibrosis<disease> in patients with NAFLD , using liver biopsy as reference. We performed a systematic search of publication databases , from 2005 through 2017. We identified 3 studies of adults with NAFLD who were assessed by MRE , TE , and liver biopsy. In a pooled analysis , we calculated the cluster-adjusted area under the curve ( AUROC) of MRE and TE for the detection of each stage of fibrosis<disease>. AUROC comparisons between MRE and TE were performed using the Delong test. Our pooled analysis included 230 participants with biopsy-proven NAFLD with mean age of 52.2 ± 13.9 years and a body mass index of 31.9 ± 7.5 kg/m2. The proportions of patients with fibrosis<disease> of stages 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were: 31.7 % , 27.8 % , 15.7 % , 13.9 % , and 10.9 % , respectively. The AUROC of TE vs MRE for detection of fibrosis<disease> stages ≥ 1 was 0.82 ( 95 % CI , 0.76-0.88) vs 0.87 ( 95 % CI , 0.82-0.91) ( P = .04); for stage ≥ 2 was 0.87 ( 95 % CI , 0.82-0.91) vs 0.92 ( 95 % CI , 0.88-0.96) ( P = .03); for stage ≥ 3 was 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.78-0.90) vs 0.93 ( 95 % CI , 0.89-0.96) ( P = .001); for stage ≥ 4 was 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.73-0.94) vs 0.94 ( 95 % CI , 0.89-0.99) ( P = .005). In a pooled analysis of data from individual participants with biopsy-proven NAFLD , we found MRE to have a statistically significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than TE in detection of each stage of fibrosis<disease>. MRE and TE each have roles in detection of fibrosis<disease> in patients with NAFLD , depending upon the level of accuracy desired.
