  Modular but geometrically constrained ligands were used to investigate the impact of key ligand design parameters ( charge and bite angle) on CO2 hydrogenation and formic acid dehydrogenation activity. These studies yielded an optimized catalyst that achieved over 118000 turnovers in CO2 hydrogenation , 247000 turnovers in HCO2H dehydrogenation , was applied in a hydrogen storage device used for 6 cycles of hydrogen storage/release without requiring changes in pH or solvent , and generated H2/CO2 gas at a pressure of 190 atm from formic acid.
