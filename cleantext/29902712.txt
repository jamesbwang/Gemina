  To examine the occurrence of intra-abdominal adhesions ( IAA) among women with placenta accreta ( PA). Case control study conducted at a single teaching hospital on data from January 2004 to December 2016. The cases included women who underwent a cesarean hysterectomy due to PA and had a pathological confirmation of accretion. The controls were matched for delivery date and number of cesarean deliveries ( CDs) at a ratio of 1:4. IAA were categorized as `` none '' , `` filmy '' , or `` dense ''. The outcome measures were rate of IAA. In order to detect a 25 % difference in overall IAA between the groups , with alpha of 0.05 and 80 % power , a sample size of 165 women was needed. Overall , 165 women ( 33 and 132 in the case and control groups , respectively) were included. Except for maternal age , there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in demographic and obstetric variables. Overall IAA rate was 30.3 % and 47.7 % in the case and control groups , respectively ( RR: 0.64; 95 % CI: 0.37-1.10 , p = 0.04). Rate of dense adhesions was 15.2 % and 32.6 % in the case and control groups , respectively ( RR: 0.47 , 95 % CI: 0.20-1.08; p = 0.03). After adjustment for maternal age , there was a significantly lower rate of overall IAA ( RR = 0.39; 95 % CI: 0.17-0.93; p = 0.02) and dense adhesions ( RR = 0.30; 95 % CI: 0.11-0.87; p = 0.02) among the cases. The incidence and severity of IAA following CDs are low , among women who develop PA..
