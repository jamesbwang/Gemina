  Cyanobacteria are important photosynthetic organisms inhabiting a range of dynamic environments. This phylum is distinctive among photosynthetic organisms in containing genes encoding uncharacterized cystathionine Î²-synthase ( CBS)- chloroplast protein ( CP12) fusion proteins. These consist of two domains , each recognized as stand-alone photosynthetic regulators with different functions described in cyanobacteria ( CP12) and plants ( CP12 and CBSX). Here we show that CBS-CP12 fusion proteins are encoded in distinct gene neighborhoods , several unrelated to photosynthesis. Most frequently , CBS-CP12 genes are in a gene cluster with thioredoxin A ( TrxA) , which is prevalent in bloom-forming , marine symbiotic , and benthic mat cyanobacteria. Focusing on a CBS-CP12 from
