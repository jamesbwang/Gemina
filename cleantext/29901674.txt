  Herein , we report the development of an electrochemical biosensor for Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 diagnostic based on amino-functionalized metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) as a new generation of organic-inorganic hybrid nanocomposites. The electrical and morphological properties of MOFs were enhanced by interweaving each isolated MOF crystal with polyaniline ( PANI). Subsequent attachment of the amine-modified aptamer to the polyanilinated MOFs was accomplished using glutaraldehyde ( GA) as a cross-linking agent. The prepared biocompatible platform was carefully characterized by means of field-emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM) , energy-dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS) , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) , and X-ray powder diffraction ( XRD) techniques. The biosensor fabrication and its electrochemical characterizations were monitored by cyclic voltammetry ( CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS) techniques. Differential pulse voltammetry ( DPV) was applied to monitoring and quantitation of the interaction between the aptamer and E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 using methylene blue ( MB) as an electrochemical indicator. Changes in the reduction peak current of MB in the presence of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 was recorded as an analytical signal and indicated a relationship with the logarithm of the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 concentration in the range of 2.1 Ã— 10
