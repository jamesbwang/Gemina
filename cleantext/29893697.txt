  The correlation between interleukin-28B ( IL-28B) polymorphisms and chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> ( CHC) progression is debatable. Here , we aimed to evaluate the relation between IL-28B C/T genotypes and the development of cirrhotic liver. Extracellular matrix ( ECM) proteins , FibroScan and model for end-stage liver disease ( MELD) were used to substantiate the severity of liver disease. IL-28B rs12979860 , liver stiffness and ECM proteins were assessed in 272 CHC patients. Cirrhosis percentage increased to 10 % , 52 % and 96 % with the increasing number of T alleles ( CC , CT and TT , respectively). Also , elevated ECM proteins levels were correlated with the increasing number of T alleles. Interestingly , among cirrhotic patients , liver stiffness , MELD and ECM proteins were significantly ( P < 0.0001) higher in patients with TT more than CT genotype. FibroScan , hyaluronic acid , Laminin , Collagen IV and the N-terminal pro-peptide of collagen type III have high accuracy to differentiate liver status in CC from TT genotype. Area under receiver-operating characteristic curve ( 95 % CI) were 1.0 ( 1.0-1.0) , 0.97 ( 0.96- 1.0) , 0.93 ( 0.85-1.0) , 0.98 ( 0.97-1.0) and 0.93 ( 0.91-0.97) , respectively. This study suggests that IL-28B T allele affects the natural course of CHC type 4 and also suggests that carriage of the IL-28B C allele protects from unfavorable clinical outcomes in CHC as coexistence of C allele with T allele reduced cirrhosis severity.
