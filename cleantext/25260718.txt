  To educate clinicians about the epidemiology , etiologies , diagnosis , and management of pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction ( PAMI). The risk of myocardial infarction is increased more than threefold around the time of pregnancy. In the recent series , PAMI is most commonly caused by spontaneous coronary artery dissection , followed by atherosclerosis. Percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting may be required , but conservative management with medical therapy is generally advised when possible , particularly in cases of coronary dissection. Labor and delivery in women with PAMI warrants advanced planning by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetrics , anesthesia , and cardiology. Women with myocardial infarction should be referred to cardiac rehabilitation. Pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction is a significant contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality. Management should be tailored based on the underlying etiology and on whether the patient is still pregnant or postpartum. Further research is needed to define optimal evaluation and management of this condition.
