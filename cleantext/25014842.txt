  Thalidomide was indicated as a sedative and antiemetic and prescribed for pregnant women. Its tragic teratogenic effects culminated in withdrawal from the market. Since the discovery of its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory actions , thalidomide has been used in the treatment of leprosy<disease> and multiple myeloma , which justify studies of its stability. We investigated the effects of irradiation of thalidomide up to 100 kGy ( fourfold the usual sterilizing dose for pharmaceutics). The β polymorph of thalidomide was obtained in an isothermal experiment at 270 °C. All samples underwent gamma irradiation for specific times. At different doses , decomposition of the pharmaceutical was not observed up to 100 kGy. The observed effect was angle turning between the phthalimide and glutarimide rings modulated by repulsion towards the carbonyl group , leading to a stable energetic configuration , as measured by the equilibrium in the torsion angle after irradiation. The thalidomide molecule has a center of symmetry , so a full turn starting from 57.3 ° will lead to an identical molecule. Further irradiation will start the process again. Samples irradiated at 30 and 100 kGy have more compact unit cells and a lower volume , which leads to an increase in the intermolecular hydrogen interaction within the unit cell , resulting in higher thermal stability for polymorph α.
