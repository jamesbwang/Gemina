  Accurate self-regulation of performance is important for trainees. Trainees rely on cues to make monitoring judgments to self-regulate their performance. Ideally , cues and monitoring judgements accurately reflect performance , as measured by cue diagnosticity ( the ability of a cue to predict performance) and monitoring accuracy ( the ability of a monitoring judgement to predict performance). However , this process is far from perfect , emphasizing the need for more accurate cues and monitoring judgements. Perhaps the mental effort of a task could be a cue used to inform certainty judgements. The purpose of this study is to measure cue utilization and cue diagnosticity of mental effort and monitoring accuracy of certainty for self-regulation of performance. Focused on the task of ECG interpretation , 22 PGY 1-3 Internal Medicine residents at McMaster University provided a diagnosis for 10 ECGs , rating their level of certainty ( 0-100 %) and mental effort ( Paas scale , 1-9). 220 ECGs completed by 22 participants were analyzed using path analysis. There was a negative moderate path coefficient between certainty and mental effort ( β =- 0.370 , p < 0.001) , reflecting cue utilization. Regarding cue diagnosticity of mental effort , this was reflected in a small negative path coefficient between mental effort and diagnostic accuracy ( β =- 0.170 , p = 0.013). Regarding monitoring accuracy , a moderate path coefficient was observed between certainty and diagnostic accuracy ( β = 0.343 , p < 0.001). Our results support mental effort as a cue and certainty as a monitoring judgement for self-regulated performance. Yet , reported correlations are not very high. Future research is needed to identify additional cues.
