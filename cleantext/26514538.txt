  To clarify period prevalence ( PP) , incidence rate ( Ir) , and reported mortality for patients with bladder cancer ( BC) in Isfahan Province/Iran , as BC is the most common cancer of the urinary tract in Iran and other parts of the world. Data from 21 March 2011 to 3 March 2015 was obtained from the Isfahan Cancer Registry. BC was distinguished by the related established topography code ( C67). Ir and PP were calculated and expressed per 100 000 persons. In all , 279 females and 1376 males were identified. For the total population the PP was calculated as 33.2. This value corresponded to a PP of 54.4 for males and 11.4 for females ( The PP for BC in the male population was 4.8-times higher than females. There was a 28.6 % increase in the Ir over the study period. Further study concerning environmental exposure , genetic factors , job-related exposure to various chemical carcinogens , and geographical distribution in Isfahan and its ' rural provinces would seem to be valuable.
