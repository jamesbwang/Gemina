  Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase ( PhaB) , involved in poly ( 3-hydroxybutyrate) ( P ( 3HB)) biosynthesis , requires the coenzyme NADPH as a reducing agent. In this study , the effect of NADPH supply on P ( 3HB) production was investigated in vitro and in vivo using a phosphite dehydrogenase double mutant ( PtxD
