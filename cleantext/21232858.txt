  Removal of arsenic from water reservoirs is the issue of great concern in many places around the globe. As adsorption is one of the most efficient techniques for treatment of As-containing media , thus the present study concerns application of iron oxides-hydroxides ( akaganeite) as adsorbents for removal of this harmful metal from aqueous solution. Two types of akaganeite were tested: synthetic one ( A) and the same modified using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ( A
