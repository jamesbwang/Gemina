  In radiotherapy treatment planning , tumor delineation based on diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI) by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is a promising technique. MR-only-based target definition becomes important with the recent development of MRI integrated radiotherapy treatment modalities. In this case series , DWI-based gross tumor volume ( GTV) was validated using pathology and compared with a clinical GTV based on computed tomography ( CT) imaging and MRI. This case series includes three patients with a laryngeal tumor. Prior to total laryngectomy ( TLE) , imaging was performed on CT and MRI , including a DWI scan. After TLE , the surgical specimen was processed and cut into 3-mm thick slices. The tumor was delineated on hematoxylin-eosin ( HE) stained sections by a pathologist ( tumor
