  The actin cytoskeleton and Rho GTPase signaling to actin assembly are prime targets of bacterial and viral pathogens , simply because actin is involved in all motile and membrane remodeling processes , such as phagocytosis , macropinocytosis , endocytosis , exocytosis , vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion events , motility , and last but not least , autophagy. This article aims at providing an overview of the most prominent pathogen-induced or- hijacked actin structures , and an outlook on how future research might uncover additional , equally sophisticated interactions.
