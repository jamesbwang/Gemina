  In mice living under normal animal house conditions , the brown adipocytes in classical brown adipose tissue depots are already essentially fully differentiated: UCP1 mRNA and UCP1 protein levels are practically saturated. This means that any further recruitment- in response to cold exposure or any other browning agent- does not result in significant augmentation of these parameters. This may easily be construed to indicate that classical brown adipose tissue can not be further recruited. However , this is far from the case: the capacity for further recruitment instead lies in the ability of the tissue to increase the number of brown-fat cells , a remarkable and highly controlled physiological recruitment process. We have compiled here the available data concerning the unique ability of norepinephrine to increase cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis in brown adipocytes. Adrenergically stimulated cell proliferation is fully mediated via Î²
