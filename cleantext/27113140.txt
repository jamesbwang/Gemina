  Sponge-associated prokaryotic diversity has been studied from a wide range of marine environments across the globe. However , for certain regions , e.g. , Vietnam , Thailand , Cambodia , and Singapore , an overview of the sponge-associated prokaryotic communities is still pending. In this study we characterized the prokaryotic communities from 27 specimens , comprising 18 marine sponge species , sampled from the central coastal region of Vietnam. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA) gene fragments was used to investigate sponge-associated bacterial and archaeal diversity. Overall , 14 bacterial phyla and one archaeal phylum were identified among all 27 samples. The phylum
