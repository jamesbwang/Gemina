  Many studies have reported that there are several differences between genders which may result in altered neuromuscular control. Although the existing evidence suggests that low back pain ( LBP) affects the ability to control posture<symptom> , there is little evidence the gender differences in postural control in people with nonspecific chronic LBP. Are there any gender differences in postural control and correlations between postural control , pain , disability , and fear of movement in people with nonspecific chronic LBP? Static and dynamic postural control were evaluated using a computerized postural control assessment tool including assessments for limits of stability ( LOS) , unilateral stance , and modified clinical test of sensory interaction on balance<symptom>. Pain intensity and fear of movement were assessed using a visual analogue scale and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia , respectively. This cross-sectional study included 51 people ( 25 females and 26 males) with nonspecific chronic LBP. Mean reaction time in the LOS test was significantly less in male participants compared with females when adjusted for pain intensity and disability level , F ( 1,45) = 4.596 , p = .037 , Î·p This study suggests that there is no difference in most of the static and dynamic postural control variables between females and males; however , higher fear of movement , and pain intensity during activity are more associated with impaired dynamic balance<symptom> in females with nonspecific chronic LBP.
