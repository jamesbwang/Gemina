  Orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides reared at 34 ‰ and 27 °C were abruptly transferred to 6 ‰ , 20 ‰ and 34 ‰ ( control) and examined for innate cellular and humoral parameters after 3-96 h. Total leucocyte count ( TLC) , respiratory burst ( RB) , phagocytic activity ( PA) , alternative complement pathway ( ACP) and lysozyme activity were significantly decreased 3-6 h , 3-6 h , 3-96 h , 3-96 h and 3-96 h , respectively after transferal into 6 ‰ salinity. TLC , RB and PA significantly increased after 3-48 h , 3-96 h and 3-24 h , respectively , with recovery of TLC and PA after 96 h and 48-96 h , whereas ACP and lysozyme activity significantly decreased 3-96 h after being transferred to 20 ‰. In another experiment , grouper reared at 34 ‰ and 27 °C were injected with Vibrio<pathogen> alginolyticus<pathogen> grown in tryptic soy broth ( TSB) at 2.3 × 10
