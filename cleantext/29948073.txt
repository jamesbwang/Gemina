  To evaluate the safety , feasibility and diagnostic performance of real-time MR-guided brain biopsy using a 1.0-T open MRI scanner. Medical records of 86 consecutive participants who underwent brain biopsy under the guidance of a 1.0-T open MRI scanner with real-time and MR fluoroscopy techniques were evaluated retrospectively. All procedures were performed under local anaesthesia and intravenous conscious sedation. Diagnostic yield , diagnostic accuracy , complication rate and procedure duration were assessed. The lesions<symptom> were divided into two groups according to maximum diameters: ≤ 1.5 cm ( n = 16) and > 1.5 cm ( n = 70). The two groups were compared using Fisher 's exact test. Diagnostic yield and diagnostic accuracy were 95.3 % and 94.2 % , respectively. The diagnostic yield of lesions<symptom> ≤ 1.5 cm and > 1.5 cm were 93.8 % and 95.7 % , respectively. There was no significant difference in diagnostic yield between the two groups ( p > 0.05). Mean procedure duration was 41 ± 5 min ( range 33-49 min). All biopsy needles were placed with one pass. Complication rate was 3.5 % ( 3/86). Minor complications included three cases of a small amount of haemorrhage. No serious complications were observed. Real-time MR-guided brain biopsy using a 1.0-T open MRI scanner is a safe , feasible and accurate diagnostic technique for pathological diagnosis of brain lesions<symptom>. The procedure duration is shortened and biopsy work flow is simplified. It could be considered as an alternative for brain biopsy. • Real-time MRI-guided brain biopsy using a 1.0-T open MRI scanner is safe , feasible and accurate. • No serious complications occurred in real-time MRI-guided brain biopsy. • Procedure duration is shortened and biopsy work flow is simplified.
