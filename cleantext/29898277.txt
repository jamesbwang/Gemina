  The relevance of medical colleges has been questioned and their ability to respond to members ' needs and system failures is unknown. We hypothesise that members believe that medical colleges are relevant to the current health agenda. We conducted a survey by email to determine satisfaction with the current state of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians ( RACP) relevance and tested agreement with suggestions for change. We found that of 21 000 survey links sent , 13.1 % of addressees replied. When questioned regarding the current state , less than 50 % of respondents agreed with any of eight positive statements. Over two thirds supported involvement in policy and advocacy , as well as the use of digital plebiscites to express their views. Clarity around the use of members ' subscriptions and value for money had the lowest scores. Of importance was the expression of need for a medical college ( 71 %) and the finding that 58 % of respondents would give more time to the RACP if asked. Of all respondents , 22 % provided written comments that closely reflected scores on categorical questions. We conclude that , despite reported disengagement and lack of support for the current state , the majority of respondents to a survey of relevance believed in the need for a medical college.
