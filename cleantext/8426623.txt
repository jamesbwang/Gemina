  This study aimed to evaluate whether a prototype echo planar imaging sequence with integrated-shimming ( iShim-EPI) can improve image quality in the thyroid gland in comparison to 3D-volume shimming echo planar imaging ( 3D-Shim-EPI) , and to compare ADC values derived from iShim-EPI with those of 3D-Shim-EPI. Twenty-one patients with thyroid disease were enrolled and underwent axial DWIs with iShim-EPI and 3D-Shim-EPI using a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner in this prospective study. Both sets of DWI images were evaluated by two independent observers who identified susceptibility and ghost artifacts and evaluated the images ' capacity to detect thyroid nodules<symptom> using quantitative scores. The ADC values of the thyroid nodules<symptom> and the normal thyroid gland were measured two times within a 4-week period. The reproducibility was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. There were significant differences in the image quality scores for susceptibility ( 2.81 ± 0.37 vs. 1.93 ± 0.29 ,
