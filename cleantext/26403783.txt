  Optimal treatment for advanced cervical cancer after first line chemotherapy remains undefined. Immune checkpoint inhibition with pembrolizumab , a programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1) inhibitor , is under investigation. We analyzed the micro-environmental and molecular genetic profile of tumors from 4 patients with metastatic cervical cancer treated with off-label second-line pembrolizumab in an effort to identify predictive biomarkers. All patients received 2 mg/kg of pembrolizumab , 3-weekly until disease progression. Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) for PD-1 , PD-L1 , CD3 and CD8 , as well as next generation sequencing ( NGS) for 50 cancer-related genes were performed on tumor samples. All patients tolerated treatment well with no discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity. One patient experienced dramatic and prolonged partial response , and remains stable on pembrolizumab with a progression free survival ( PFS) of 21 months at the time of reporting of this series. Three patients experienced disease progression as best response. In the exceptional responder , there was no tumoral expression of PD-L1 , however , combined positive score ( CPS) for PD-L1 was 1 and we identified somatic mutations in
