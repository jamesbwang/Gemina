  For biofilters treating waste gases containing volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) , biomass accumulation is a common problem which will induce bed clogging and significant decrease in VOCs removal efficiency during long-term operation. In this study , ozone injection was developed as a biomass control strategy , and its effects on the biofilter performance and the microbial community structure were investigated in long-term operation. Two biofilters , identified as BF1 and BF2 , were operated continuously for 160 days treating gaseous toluene under the same conditions , except that 200 mg/m
