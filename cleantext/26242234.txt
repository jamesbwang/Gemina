  This paper presents an analysis of call data records pertaining to a telephone helpline in Ireland among individuals seeking mental health and well-being support and among those who are in a suicidal crisis. The objective of our study was to examine whether rule sets generated from decision tree classification , trained using features derived from callers ' several initial calls , could be used to predict what caller type they would become. Machine learning techniques were applied to the call log data , and five distinct patterns of caller behaviors were revealed , each impacting the helpline capacity in different ways. The primary findings of this study indicate that a significant model ( P < .001) for predicting caller type from call log data obtained from the first 8 calls is possible. This indicates an association between callers ' behavior exhibited during initial calls and their behavior over the lifetime of using the service. These data-driven findings contribute to advanced workload forecasting for operational management of the telephone-based helpline and inform the literature on helpline caller behavior in general.
