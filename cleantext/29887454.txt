  The ratio of echocardiography-derived tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( TAPSE) and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure ( PASP) has recently been reported as an independent prognostic parameter in heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The TAPSE/PASP ratio has not been evaluated in detail in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH). We analyzed TAPSE/PASP in 290 patients with PAH entered into the Giessen Pulmonary Hypertension Registry between November 2003 and July 2014. The prognostic relevance of TAPSE/PASP was assessed with multivariate Cox regression models , adjusting for clinical covariates , echocardiographic parameters , or hemodynamics , and was confirmed by Kaplan-Meier analyses. When stratified by tertile of TAPSE/PASP ( low: < 0.19 mm/mmHg; middle: 0.19-0.32 mm/mmHg; high: > 0.32 mm/mmHg) , patients in the low tertile showed significantly compromised hemodynamic , functional , and echocardiographic status compared with patients in the middle and high tertiles. In all multivariate models , TAPSE/PASP remained independently associated with overall mortality: the hazard ratio ( 95 % confidence interval) was 1.87 ( 1.35-2.59) when adjusting for clinical covariates ( p < .001) , 5.21 ( 2.17-12.5) when adjusting for echocardiographic parameters ( p < .001) , 1.92 ( 1.30-2.83) when adjusting for hemodynamics ( p = .001) , and 4.13 ( 2.02-8.48) when adjusting for a selection of previously identified independent echocardiographic and hemodynamic prognostic indicators ( p < .001). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed better overall survival in the middle and high tertiles versus the low tertile ( log-rank p < .001). The TAPSE/PASP ratio is a meaningful prognostic parameter in patients with PAH and is associated with hemodynamics and functional class.
