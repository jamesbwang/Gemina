  Bone fracture followed by delayed or non-union typically requires bone graft intervention. Autologous bone grafts remain the clinical `` gold standard ''. Recently , synthetic bone grafts such as Medtronic 's Infuse Bone Graft have opened the possibility to pharmacological and tissue engineering strategies to bone repair following fracture. This clinically-available strategy uses an absorbable collagen sponge as a carrier material for recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( rhBMP-2) and a similar strategy has been employed by Stryker with BMP-7 , also known as osteogenic protein-1 ( OP-1). A key advantage to this approach is its `` off-the-shelf '' nature , but there are clear drawbacks to these products such as edema<symptom> , inflammation<symptom> , and ectopic bone growth. While there are clinical challenges associated with a lack of controlled release of rhBMP-2 and OP-1 , these are among the first clinical examples to wed understanding of biological principles with biochemical production of proteins and pharmacological principles to promote tissue regeneration ( known as regenerative pharmacology). After considering the clinical challenges with such synthetic bone grafts , this review considers the various biomaterial carriers under investigation to promote bone regeneration. This is followed by a survey of the literature where various pharmacological approaches and molecular targets are considered as future strategies to promote more rapid and mature bone regeneration. From the review , it should be clear that pharmacological understanding is a key aspect to developing these strategies.
