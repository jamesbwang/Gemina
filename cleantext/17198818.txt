  The clinical detail , echocardiographic features , angiographic evaluation , and surgical repair of double-outlet left atrium ( LA) in a 2-year-old boy are discussed. In a solitus position and normally connected systemic and pulmonary venous drainage setting , the only outlet of the right atrium was a secundum atrial septal defect. The LA thus received the entire venous return and then drained into both ventricles through a common atrioventricular valve.
