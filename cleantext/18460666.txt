  Group B A high-throughput screen using the phorbol ester-differentiated THP-1 macrophage-like human cell line was used to quantify phagocytosis of a diverse group of 35 different human clinical isolates of GBS representing a wide variety of capsular serotypes. Validation studies were conducted using human primary phagocytes. Phagocytosis of GBS differed widely across clinical isolates but this was not related to capsular serotype , genetic sequence type , pilus type , or clinical source of the GBS isolate ( colonizing or invasive strain). Structural and/or biochemical differences among diverse GBS strains are reflected in a diverse capacity for macrophages to ingest them through non-opsonic phagocytosis. Mechanisms explaining these differences are not clear.
