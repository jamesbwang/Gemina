  Despite remarkable progress in the reduction of under-five mortality , childhood diarrhea<disease> is still the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in this highly susceptible and vulnerable population. In Ethiopia , study findings regarding prevalence and determinants of diarrhea<disease> amongst under-five children have been inconsistent. Therefore , this systematic review and meta-analysis estimates the pooled prevalence of diarrhea<disease> and its determinants among under-five children in Ethiopia. International databases , including PubMed , Web of Science , EMBASE , CINAHL , Google Scholar , Science Direct , and the Cochrane Library , were systematically searched. All identified observational studies reporting the prevalence and determinants of diarrhea<disease> among under-five children in Ethiopia were included. Two authors independently extracted all necessary data using a standardized data extraction format. STATA Version 13 statistical software was used. The Cochrane Q test statistics and I2 test were used to assess the heterogeneity of the studies. A random effects model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence of diarrhea<disease> Moreover , the associations between determinant factors and childhood diarrhea<disease> were examined using the random effect model. After reviewing of 535 studies , 31studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The findings from the 31 studies revealed that the pooled prevalence of diarrhea<disease> among under-five children in Ethiopia was 22 % ( 95 % CI: 19 , 25 %). Subgroup analysis of this study revealed that the highest prevalence was observed in Afar region ( 27 %) , followed by Somali and Dire Dawa regions ( 26 %) , then Addis Abeba ( 24 %). Lack of maternal education ( OR: 2.5 , 95 % CI: 1.3 , 2.1) , lack of availability of latrine ( OR: 2.0 , 95 % CI: 1.3 , 3.2) , urban residence ( OR: 1.9 , 95 % CI: 1.2 , 3.0) , and maternal hand washing ( OR: 2.2 , 95 % CI: 2.0 , 2.6) were significantly associated with childhood diarrhea<disease> In this study , diarrhea<disease> among under-five children in Ethiopia was significantly high. Lack of maternal education , lack of availability of latrine , urban residence , and lack of maternal hand washing were significantly associated with childhood
