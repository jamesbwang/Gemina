  The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of microRNA ( miR) -146 a in the pulmonary macrophages , peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum of patients with lung injury caused by paraquat poisoning<disease> , as well as the underlying mechanism of its regulation in the disease. A total of 26 patients with lung injury caused by paraquat poisoning<disease> were included in the present study. In addition , 33 healthy subjects were included as the control group. The expression levels of interleukin ( IL) -6 mRNA and miR-146a was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR). Western blotting was used to measure IL-6 protein expression , while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was also performed to determine the secretion of IL-6 protein. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to examine whether IL-6 mRNA is a direct target of miR-146a. Patients with lung injury caused by paraquat poisoning<disease> exhibited higher IL-6 mRNA and protein levels as compared with those in healthy subjects. In addition , miR-146a expression in patients with paraquat poisoning-induced lung injury was significantly reduced in comparison with that in healthy subjects. Notably , the overexpression of miR-146a by mimic transfection downregulated the expression of IL-6 in pulmonary macrophages. The results of dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that IL-6 mRNA was a direct target of miR-146a. Therefore , the present study demonstrated that increased expression of IL-6 in patients with lung injury caused by paraquat poisoning<disease> is associated with decreased expression of miR-146a. Furthermore , miR-146a may regulate the occurrence and immune response of lung injury caused by paraquat poisoning<disease> and this process is possibly achieved via IL-6 , an important cytokine that mediates
