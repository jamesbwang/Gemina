  As part of an oral health service for Aboriginal people in central northern New South Wales ( NSW) , Australia , oral health promotion was identified as a priority by the local Aboriginal community. The objective of this study was to collaborate with local Aboriginal communities to determine ( 1) the oral health needs of Aboriginal children aged 5-12 years , ( 2) the oral health knowledge and attitudes towards oral health of parents/guardians and ( 3) the perceived barriers and enablers towards oral health promotion for school children by local school staff and community health workers. The results of this collaboration will inform a community-owned oral health promotion program. Aboriginal children aged 5-12 years enrolled in local schools received a dental screening by a single examiner. The number of decayed , missing and filled teeth of primary and permanent dentition ( dmft/DMFT) , plaque and gingivitis<disease> were recorded. Children completed a questionnaire assessing current oral hygiene practices , dental history and information on their diet. Parents/guardians completed a questionnaire assessing oral health knowledge and attitudes towards oral health. School staff and community health workers completed a questionnaire assessing attitudes , barriers and enablers towards implementing an oral health promotion program in schools. Eighty-eight children , representing 94 % of those eligible , were screened , and 78 ( 82 %) completed a questionnaire. The mean dmft/DMFT score was 5.3. Risk factors for dental<disease> caries<disease> identified included lack of toothbrush ownership ( 35 %) , minimal fluoride toothpaste use ( 24 %) , limited daily tooth brushing ( 51 %) and frequent consumption of sugary foods ( 72 %) and soft drinks ( 64 %). Questionnaires were completed by 32 parents/guardians and 39 school and community health workers. Parents/guardians had limited oral health knowledge. School and health staff were willing to support a health promotion program to improve dental health of children. Aboriginal children living in rural and remote communities in NSW experience high rates of dental<disease> caries<disease> Oral health promotion is urgently required to reduce the burden of dental<disease> caries<disease> and should address oral hygiene behaviours , fluoride use and access to healthy foods and drinks.
