  Selective and continuous tracking of dynamic organelles is crucial for modern biology. We herein report a ship-in-a-bottle strategy for tagging lysosomes by a strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition to couple a pH sensor ( RC) with mannose-6-carboxylate ( M6C) actively transported into lysosomes through cell sorting. In contrast to classical acidotropic sensors , which are prone to dissipate from lysosomes , M6C-RC formed in situ is stably trapped in lysosomes without resort to lysosomal acidity and exhibits `` always-on '' blue fluorescence to pinpoint lysosomes and red-to-blue fluorescence ratios indicative of the lysosomal pH value. These advantages enable tracking of stressed lysosomes , and necrosis<symptom> to be differentiated from apoptosis on the basis of lysosomal pH changes. The cell-sorting-mediated bioorthogonal tagging strategy offers a new route to track stressed organelles with disrupted physiological organelle-probe affinity.
