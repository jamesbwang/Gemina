  From the perspective of the situated conceptualization framework , the primary purpose of concepts is for categorizing and integrating elements of situations to support goal-directed action ( including communication and social interaction). To the extent that important situational elements are categorized and integrated properly , effective goal-directed action follows. Over time , frequent patterns of co-occurring concepts within situations become established in memory as situated conceptualizations , conditioning the conceptual system and producing habitual patterns of conceptual processing. As a consequence , individual concepts are most basically represented within patterns of concepts that become entrained with specific kinds of physical situations. In this framework , the concrete versus abstract distinction between concepts is no longer useful , with two other distinctions becoming important instead: ( i) external versus internal situational elements , ( ii) situational elements versus situational integrations. Whereas concepts for situational elements originate in distributed neural networks that provide continual feeds about components of situations , concepts for situational integrations originate in association areas that establish temporal co-occurrence relations between situational elements , both external and internal. We propose that studying concepts in the context of situated action is necessary for establishing complete accounts of them , and that continuing to study concepts in isolation is likely to provide relatively incomplete and distorted accounts.This article is part of the theme issue ` Varieties of abstract concepts: development , use and representation in the brain '.
