  Modification of dissolved gas content by acoustic droplet vaporization ( ADV) has been proposed for several therapeutic applications. Reducing dissolved oxygen ( DO) during reperfusion of ischemic tissue during coronary interventions could inhibit reactive oxygen species production and rescue myocardium. The objective of this study was to determine whether intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS) can trigger ADV and reduce DO. Perfluoropentane emulsions were created using high-speed shaking and microfluidic manufacturing. High-speed shaking resulted in a polydisperse droplet distribution ranging from less than 1 micron to greater than 16 microns in diameter. Microfluidic manufacturing produced a narrower size range of droplets with diameters between 8.0 microns and 9.6 microns. The DO content of the fluids was measured before and after ADV triggered by IVUS exposure. Duplex B-mode and passive cavitation imaging was performed to assess nucleation of ADV. An increase in echogenicity indicative of ADV was observed after exposure with a clinical IVUS system. In a flow phantom , a 20 % decrease in DO was measured distal to the IVUS transducer when droplets , formed via high-speed shaking , were infused. In a static fluid system , the DO content was reduced by 11 % when droplets manufactured with a microfluidic chip were exposed to IVUS. These results demonstrate that a reduction of DO by ADV is feasible using a clinical IVUS system. Future studies will assess the potential therapeutic efficacy of IVUS-nucleated ADV and methods to increase the magnitude of DO scavenging.
