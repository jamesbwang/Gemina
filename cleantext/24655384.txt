  YTH domain-containing RNA-binding proteins are involved in post-transcriptional regulation and play important roles in the growth and development as well as abiotic stress responses of plants. However , YTH genes have not been previously studied in cucumber ( Cucumis sativus). In this study , a total of five YTH genes ( CsYTH1-CsYTH5) were identified in cucumber , which could be mapped on three out of the seven cucumber chromosomes. All CsYTH proteins had highly conserved C-terminal YTH domains , and two of them ( CsYTH1 and CsYTH4) harbored extra CCCH and P/Q/N-rich domains. The phylogenesis , conserved motifs and exon-intron structure of YTH genes from cucumber , Arabidopsis and rice were also analyzed. The phylogenetically closely clustered YTHs shared similar gene structures and conserved motifs. An analysis of the cis-acting regulatory elements in the upstream region of these genes resulted in the identification of many cis-elements related to stress , hormone and development. Expression analysis based on the transcriptome data showed that some CsYTHs had development- or tissue-specific expression. In addition , their expression levels were altered under various stresses such as salt , drought , cold , and abscisic acid ( ABA) treatments. These findings lay the foundation for the functional analysis of CsYTHs in the future.
