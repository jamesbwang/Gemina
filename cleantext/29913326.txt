  This study examined the predictive value of serum cystatin C ( Cys-C) concentration , measured during routine periodic health examinations , in the renal prognosis of dogs. A cohort of 140 dogs weighing < 15 kg whose serum Cys-C concentrations were measured during periodic health examinations from December 2013 to March 2016 were prospectively studied , with renal disease-related death the predicted end point. Of the 140 dogs , nine died from renal diseases during the follow-up period ( 539 ± 249 days). Serum Cys-C concentrations were higher in the dogs that subsequently died of renal disease than in the censored group ( 0.8 ± 0.25 vs. 0.3 ± 0.1 mg/dl , respectively; P < .01). Dogs with high serum Cys-C concentrations ( > 0.55 mg/dl) had a shorter ( P < .01) renal disease-specific survival period than those with low serum Cys-C concentrations ( ≤ 0.55 mg/dl). In conclusion , high serum Cys-C concentrations in periodic health examinations in dogs < 15 kg predicted poorer prognosis for renal function.
