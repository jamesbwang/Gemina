  Herein , the ultrathin and robust diphenylalanine ( FF) self-assembled nanosheets were fabricated by a gold-stabilized strategy for the first time , using a facile electrospray method followed by a thermal treatment process. The key for the gold-stabilized mechanism was explored , demonstrating that the synergy of the stable binding and steric effect between gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) and the exposed amino groups of FF nanosheets , led to strong thermal stability and solvent resistance of the composites. Contributing to the features of remarkable accessible surfaces and strong laser light absorption ability of this FF/Au nanosheets , two robust functional devices , that is , solid-phase microextraction ( SPME) fiber and surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization ( SALDI) platforms , were in situ prepared for in vitro and in vivo biological analysis. The findings indicated that the fabricated platforms possessed two advantages: ( 1) rapid absorption/desorption speed ( within 5 min) and ( 2) remarkable enhancement of ionization efficiency with 2 orders of magnitude. As a result , the extraction efficiency of the SPME fiber and the quantitation ability of SALDI platform were significantly improved. This study not only demonstrated that FF/Au composites could be prepared through an electrospray method followed with thermal-treatment to serve as promising adsorption/desorption/ionization materials for specific applications but also provided useful strategy to advance the ideas for future combination of SPME with LDI technique.
