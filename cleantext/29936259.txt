  Genomic profiling of circulating tumor DNA derived from cell-free DNA ( cfDNA) in blood can provide a noninvasive method for the detection of genomic biomarkers to guide clinical decision making for cancer patients. We developed a hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing assay for genomic profiling of circulating tumor DNA from blood ( FoundationACT). High-sequencing coverage and molecular barcode-based error detection enabled accurate detection of genomic alterations , including base substitutions , short insertions/deletions , and genomic rearrangements at low allele frequencies ( AFs) , and copy number amplifications. Analytical validation was performed on 2666 reference alterations. The assay achieved > 99 % overall sensitivity ( 95 % CI , 99.1 % -99.4 %) for short variants at AF > 0.5 % , > 95 % sensitivity ( 95 % CI , 94.2 % -95.7 %) for AF 0.25 % to 0.5 % , and 70 % sensitivity ( 95 % CI , 68.2 % -71.5 %) for AF 0.125 % to 0.25 %. No false positives were detected in any samples from healthy volunteers ( n = 62). Genomic alterations detected by FoundationACT demonstrated high concordance with orthogonal reference assays run on the same clinical cfDNA samples. In 860 routine clinical cases profiled by FoundationACT , genomic alterations were detected in cfDNA at comparable frequencies to tissue; for the subset of cases with temporally matched tissue and blood samples , 75 % of genomic alterations and 83 % of short variant mutations that were detected in tissue were also detected in cfDNA. On the basis of analytical validation results , FoundationACT has been approved for use in our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified/College of American Pathologists-accredited/New York<pathogen> State-approved laboratory.
