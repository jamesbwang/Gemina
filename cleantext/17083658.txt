  Because computers are used in many aspects of today 's life , it seems necessary to include them in teaching and assessment processes. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to construct a multidimensional valid scale , to identify the factors that influenced the nature of student motivation on Computer Based Testing ( CBT) , to recognize how students self-regulated their activities around CBT , and to describe the efficiency of autonomous versus controlled situations on motivation. The study was carried out among 246 Iranian Paramedical Students of Tabriz Medical Sciences University , Tabriz , Iran; 2013-2014. The researchers prepared a questionnaire , based on the Self-Determination Theory ( SDT) , containing 26 items with a five-point Likert scale. It was prepared according to a previous valid questionnaire and by sharing opinions with some students and five professors. The factor analysis was done to perform instructional and exploratory factor analysis. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin ( KMO) measure was performed and variables were correlated highly enough to provide a reasonable basis for factor analysis. The selected 4 factors determined a 60.28 % of the variance; autonomy 26.37 % , stimulation 14.11 % , relatedness10 .71 % , and competency 9.10 %. A questionnaire was prepared and validated , based on SDT variables. The results indicated that autonomous extrinsic motivation correlated positively with intrinsic motivation and CBT. There was a general positive attitude towards computer-based testing among students. As students became intrinsically motivated through the promotion of autonomous regulation , CBT was recommended as a proper test mode.
