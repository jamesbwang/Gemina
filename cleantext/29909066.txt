  The ribosomal RNA adenine dimethyltransferases ( rAD) of KsgA/Dim1 family are universally conserved with eukaryotic rADs separated into distinct cytosolic Dim1 and organellar KsgA/TFB homologs. Among the two putative KsgA proteins encoded by the Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> genome , we found that PfKsgA1 was dually localised in the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion. The protein interacted specifically with small ribosomal subunit as detected by ribosome pull-down using anti-PfKsgA1 antibodies. Recombinant PfKsgA1 exhibited methyltransferase activity which was further confirmed by complementation in an Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> KsgA knockout strain. Similar to the human mitochondrial KsgA homologs that can additionally function as transcription regulators , PfKsgA1 also interacted with DNA in a sequence non-specific manner suggesting more than one functional role of an important ribosome biogenesis protein in Plasmodium.
