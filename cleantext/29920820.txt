  Acetaminophen ( APAP) is a well-known analgesic , deemed a very safe over-the-counter medication. However , it is also the main cause of acute liver failure ( ALF) in the Western world , via the formation of its reactive metabolite , N-acetyl p-benzoquinone imine ( NAPQI) , and its covalent attachment to liver proteins. The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive and robust quantitative assay to monitor APAP-protein binding to human serum albumin ( HSA) in patient samples. A combination of isotope dilution , peptic digestion and solid-phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring ( LC-MRM) was employed. An external calibration curve with surrogate modified protein spiked into blank serum was used for absolute quantitation. Samples were analyzed by LC-MRM to measure the modified active site peptide of HSA. The LC-MRM assay was validated and successfully applied to serum samples from patients suffering from APAP-induced ALF. Accuracy ranged from 83.8 % -113.3 % , within-run coefficient of variation ( CV) ranged from 0.3 % -6.9 % , and total CVs from 1.6 % -10.6 %. Patient samples ranged from 0.12-3.91 nmol/mL NAPQI-HSA; in-between the assay dynamic range of 0.11-50.13 nmol/mL serum. In vivo median concentrations were found to be 0.62 nmol/mL and 0.91 nmol/mL for non-spontaneous survivors ( n = 25) and individuals with irreversible liver damage ( n = 10) , respectively ( p-value = 0.028) , demonstrating significant potential as a biomarker for ALF outcome. A fast and sensitive assay was developed to accurately quantify NAPQI-HSA as a biomarker for APAP-related covalent binding in human serum.
