  Fluorogenic probes , small-molecule sensors that unmask brilliant fluorescence upon exposure to specific stimuli , are powerful tools for chemical biology. Those probes that respond to enzymatic catalysis illuminate the complex dynamics of biological processes at a level of spatiotemporal detail and sensitivity unmatched by other techniques. Here , we review recent advances in enzyme-activated fluorogenic probes for biological imaging. We organize our survey by enzyme classification , with emphasis on fluorophore masking strategies , modes of enzymatic activation , and the breadth of current and future applications. Key challenges such as probe selectivity and spectroscopic requirements are described alongside therapeutic , diagnostic , and theranostic opportunities.
