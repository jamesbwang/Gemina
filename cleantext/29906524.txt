  Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices ( LVADs) for advanced heart<symptom> failure<symptom> have been associated with gastrointestinal bleeding ( GIB). We examined the association between time of GIB after LVAD implantation and bleeding location ( determined by endoscopy) , etiology , and patient outcomes. We performed a retrospective study of consecutive patients who underwent implantation of continuous-flow LVADs from 2008 through 2015. We analyzed data on anatomic location of GIB , etiology , length of hospital stay , transfusion requirement , time to endoscopy , and rate of readmission within 30 days. GIB developed in 59 of the 271 patients ( 22 %). Higher proportions of patients with GIB during their index hospitalization for LVAD implantation had upper or lower GIB ( 86.7 %) than patients with GIB during a subsequent hospitalization ( 50.0 %; P = .013). Patients with GIB during their index hospitalization also had lower rates of middle GIB ( 0 vs 20.5 %; P = .052) , higher rates of overt GIB ( 100 % vs 63.6 %; P = .006) , longer hospital stays ( 24 days vs 11 days; P < .001) , and more transfusions before endoscopy ( 7 units vs 4 units; P = .021) compared to patients with GIB during a subsequent hospitalization. There were no significant differences between groups in time to endoscopy ( 2 days vs 2.5 days) or 30-day readmission ( 6.7 % vs 9.3 %). Angiodysplasias were identified in 100 % of patients with middle GIB compared to 48.5 % of patients with upper or lower GIB ( P < .001) in whom a definitive bleeding lesion<symptom> was identified. In a retrospective study of patients who underwent implantation of continuous-flow LVADs , timing of GIB associates with the location and severity of bleeding. Although patients with LVADs have an overall increased risk of middle GIB , patients with GIB during their index LVAD hospitalization are recommended for initial evaluation with upper endoscopy and colonoscopy due to insufficient time for the development of small bowel angiodysplasias. Patients who later develop GIB should be consented for early small bowel evaluation.
