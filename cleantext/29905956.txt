  Avatrombopag , a c-Mpl agonist , has been developed to provide an alternative therapy to standard platelet transfusion care for the treatment of thrombocytopenia<symptom>. The main objectives of this article were to describe the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of avatrombopag , to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD) relationship between plasma avatrombopag concentrations and platelet count , and to identify potential intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting PK or PK/PD in patients with chronic liver disease ( CLD). Platelet count following avatrombopag administration with and without concomitant medication was further simulated using the final population PK/PD model to explore potential dose adjustments. Avatrombopag PK was described by a 1-compartment model with combined first- and zero-order absorption and linear elimination. The relationship between the plasma avatrombopag concentrations and platelet count was well described by a 6-compartment life-span model with a linear drug effect. The final PK and PK/PD models included statistically significant but not clinically relevant effects of body<symptom> weight and CLD on apparent volume distribution and East Asian ethnicity , albumin , and thrombopoietin level on the slope parameter in the PK/PD relationship. PK/PD simulations showed comparable elevation in platelet count with and without concomitant cytochrome P450 ( CYP) 3A and CYP2C9 inhibitors for the dosing regimens of 40 and 60 mg for 5 days , with predictions of < 10 % of CLD patients exceeding platelet count > 200 Ã— 10
