  It is important to understand the number , types and regions of trials that include patient-reported outcomes ( PROs) to appreciate how patient experiences have been considered in studies of health and interventions. Twenty-seven percent of trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( 2007-2013) included PROs; however , a regional breakdown was not provided and no reviews have been conducted of the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ANZCTR). We aimed to identify trials registered with ANZCTR with PRO endpoints and describe their characteristics. ANZCTR was systematically searched from inception ( 2005) to 31 March 2017 for trials with PRO endpoints. Search terms included PRO measures listed in Patient-Reported Outcomes Quality of Life Instrument Database and Grid-Enabled Measures , as well as generic PRO terms ( e.g. `` quality of life '' ( QOL)). Trial endpoints were individually coded using an established framework to identify trials with PROs for the analysis. Of 13,666 registered trials , 6168 ( 45.1 %) included a PRO. The proportion of studies including PROs increased between 2006 and 2016 ( r = 0.74 , p = 0.009). Among the 6168 trials , there were 17,961 individual PRO endpoints , including symptoms/functional outcomes/condition-specific QOL ( 65.6 %) , generic QOL ( 13.2 %) , patient-reported experiences ( 9.9 %) , patient-reported behaviours ( 7.9 %). Mental health was the most common category ( 99.8 % included PROs) , followed by physical medicine/rehabilitation ( 65.6 %) , musculoskeletal ( 63.5 %) , public health ( 63.1 %) , and cancer ( 54.2 %). Our findings suggest growing use of PROs in the assessment of health and interventions in ANZ. Our review identifies trial categories with limited patient-reported information and provides a basis for future work on the impact of PRO findings in clinical care.
