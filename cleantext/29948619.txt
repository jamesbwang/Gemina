  Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) are lengthy noncoding transcripts which are involved in critical signaling pathways including cell cycle and apoptosis so it is not surprising to see their altered expression in human tumors. Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one the most frequent malignancies worldwide. The role of lncRNAs in colorectal adenocarcinoma is not well understood. To study the significance of lncRNAs in colorectal adenocarcinoma , we retrieved 189 approved lncRNAs from HGNC. The genes were imported into the cBioPortal database for transcriptomic analyses. We queried all the samples from TCGA provisional colorectal adenocarcinoma with RNA-seq v2 data in our study and considered RNA dysregulation with Z-score: Â± 2. The lncRNA which was altered in most of the patients were considered as `` significant lncRNA '' for further analyses. We considered the association of candidate lncRNAs with clinicopathologic parameters of samples including tumor disease anatomic site , neoplasm histologic types , tumor stage and survival. We also compute the specificity of the significant lncRNAs expression in colorectal adenocarcinoma comparing with other human cancers in cancer portal. Our analysis showed that lncRNAs SNHG6 , PVT1 and ZFAS1 allocated the maximum alteration among the colorectal cases. The expression of SNHG6 and ZFAS1 was more in rectal adenocarcinoma than the colon carcinoma while the PVT1 showed the same expression levels in both tissues. However , we found that upregulation of PVT1 has been reduced the overall survival in patients. Altogether these data showed SNHG6 , PVT1 and ZFAS1 , are promising candidates for experimental research on colorectal adenocarcinoma to discover novel biomarker for this prevalent cancer.
