  Epilepsy and Mental Retardation Limited to Females ( EFMR) is an infantile onset disorder characterized by clusters of seizures<symptom>. EFMR is due to mutations in the X-chromosome gene PCDH19 , and is underpinned by cellular mosaicism due to X-chromosome inactivation in females or somatic mutation in males. This review characterizes the neuropsychiatric profile of this disorder and examines the association of clinical and molecular factors with neuropsychiatric outcomes. Data were extracted from 38 peer-reviewed original articles including 271 individual cases. We found that seizure<symptom> onset ≤ 12 months was significantly associated ( p = 4.127 × 10
