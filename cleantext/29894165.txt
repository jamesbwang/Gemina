  Sequential unfolding of monomeric proteins is important for the global understanding of local conformational elements ( e.g. , secondary structures and domain connections) within those protein assemblies. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry ( IM-MS) is an emerging and promising technique for probing gradual protein structural perturbations in the gas phase. However , it is still challenging to track sequential unfolding in the solution phase. Here , we extended IM-MS to track in-solution sequential unfolding of monomeric proteins having single and/or multidomains. The present method combines ultrafast local heating effect ( LHE)- driven sequential unfolding with IM-MS identification. Protein sequential unfolding in solution is demonstrated by the rapid and controllable IM-MS data switch between native and gradually unfolded states. Our results show that LHE induces gradual protein conformational transitions associated with biological functions , where IM-MS tracks the sequential unfolding of monomeric proteins.
