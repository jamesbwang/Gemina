  Image guidance technology has evolved and seen widespread application in the past several decades. Advancements in the diagnostic imaging field have found new applications in radiation oncology and promoted the development of therapeutic devices with advanced imaging capabilities. A recent example is the development of linear accelerators that offer magnetic resonance imaging for real-time imaging and online adaptive planning. Volumetric imaging , in particular , offers more precise localization of soft tissue targets and critical organs which reduces setup uncertainty and permit the use of smaller setup margins. We present a review of the status of current imaging modalities available for radiation oncology and its impact on target margins and use for adaptive therapy.
