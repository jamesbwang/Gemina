  Esophageal cancer is the third most common cancer in Iran. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( NCRT) is the appropriate treatment for esophageal cancer. This study investigated the expression of cyclooxygenase ( COX) -2 enzyme in normal and tumoral tissues before any treatment in patients with esophageal cancer , this study also assessed the effect of NCRT on the expression of COX-2 enzyme in normal and tumoral tissue in samples derived by surgery furthermore , and this study investigated the relationship between expression of COX-2 enzyme and the pathologic tumor regression grade ( PTRG) patients. In this study , a total of 120 patients admitted to Omid Hospital , Imam Reza Hospitals , and Reza-Mashhad Medical Center , who were treated with NCRT , were recruited and the expression of the COX-2 enzyme in normal and tumoral tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry before and after treatment by an expert pathologist between zero and 300. PTRG was determined by a pathologist after treatment. The mean levels of COX-2 expression , obtained from tumoral and normal tissue baseline biopsy in patients , were 177.69 and 64.29 , respectively , while in surgical specimen were 177.25 and 49.84 , respectively. A significant association was found between PTRG of surgical specimen and COX-2 expression in normal tissue ( baseline biopsy) at diagnosis ( P = 0.034). The results indicated that expression of COX-2 in tumoral tissues exceeds the expression of COX-2 in normal tissue of the baseline biopsy. Patients with a high expression of COX-2 in baseline tumor biopsies had less response to treatment of pathology compared to patients with lower expression of COX-2 in baseline tumor biopsies.
