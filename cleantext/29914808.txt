  Are there differences in the effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle training on pelvic floor muscle strength and urinary incontinence symptoms in postmenopausal women who are and are not using hormone therapy? Randomised , controlled trial with concealed allocation , blinded assessors , and intention-to-treat analysis. Ninety-nine postmenopausal women , 38 of whom were using daily systemic oestrogen/progestogen therapy. The experimental group ( n = 51) received an intensive supervised pelvic floor muscle training protocol , and the control group ( n = 48) received no intervention. The randomisation was stratified by hormone therapy use. Change in pelvic floor muscle strength assessed with manometry at 12 weeks. Prevalence and severity of urinary incontinence symptoms were assessed using questionnaires. Eighty-eight women provided data that could be included in the analysis. Pelvic floor muscle training increased pelvic floor muscle strength by 8.0 cmH Pelvic floor muscle training increases pelvic floor muscle strength more in women who are not using hormone therapy than in women using hormone therapy.
