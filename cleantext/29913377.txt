  Self-disturbances are increasingly recognized as important , possibly even central , features of schizophrenia. However , little is known about the associations among different manifestations of self-disturbances. The aims of the current study were threefold. We aimed to ( 1) replicate previous findings of increased self-disturbances in schizophrenia , ( 2) correlate manifestations of self-disturbances in schizophrenia across three domains , and ( 3) correlate self-disturbances with five symptoms domains of schizophrenia , including positive , negative , disorganized symptoms , excitement , and emotional distress. We examined three domains of self-experience , including somatosensation , anomalous self-experiences , and self-concept clarity. Participants included 48 individuals with schizophrenia and 36 non-psychiatric controls. The results of this study replicate previous findings of significantly higher levels of self-disturbances in people with schizophrenia. The results also indicate positive correlations between the domains of anomalous self-experiences and self-concept clarity , but not somatosensation , in individuals with schizophrenia. As well , anomalous self-experiences were positively correlated with positive symptoms , disorganized symptoms , and emotional distress and self-concept clarity was negatively correlated with disorganized symptoms and emotional distress.
