  Hearing-impaired listeners are known to have difficulties not only with understanding speech in noise but also with judging source distance and movement , and these deficits are related to perceived handicap. It is possible that the perception of spatially dynamic sounds<symptom> can be improved with hearing aids ( HAs) , but so far this has not been investigated. In a previous study , older hearing-impaired listeners showed poorer detectability for virtual left-right ( angular) and near-far ( radial) source movements due to lateral interfering sounds<symptom> and reverberation , respectively. In the current study , potential ways of improving these deficits with HAs were explored. Using stimuli very similar to before , detailed acoustic analyses were carried out to examine the influence of different HA algorithms for suppressing noise and reverberation on the acoustic cues previously shown to be associated with source movement detectability. For an algorithm that combined unilateral directional microphones with binaural coherence-based noise reduction and for a bilateral beamformer with binaural cue preservation , movement-induced changes in spectral coloration , signal-to-noise ratio , and direct-to-reverberant energy ratio were greater compared with no HA processing. To evaluate these two algorithms perceptually , aided measurements of angular and radial source movement detectability were performed with 20 older hearing-impaired listeners. The analyses showed that , in the presence of concurrent interfering sounds<symptom> and reverberation , the bilateral beamformer could restore source movement detectability in both spatial dimensions , whereas the other algorithm only improved detectability in the near-far dimension. Together , these results provide a basis for improving the detectability of spatially dynamic sounds<symptom> with HAs.
