  The oxidation-reduction ( redox)- responsive micelle system is based on a diselenide-containing triblock copolymer , poly ( Îµ-caprolactone)- bis ( diselenide-methoxy poly ( ethylene glycol)/ poly ( ethylene glycol)- folate) ( PCL- ( SeSe-mPEG/PEG-FA) On-demand drug actuation is highly desired. Redox-responsive polymeric DDSs have been shown to be able to respond and release their cargo in a selective manner when encountering a significant change in the potential difference , such as that present between cancerous and healthy tissues. This study offers an added advantage to the field of redox-responsive polymers by reporting a new type of shell-sheddable micelle based on an amphiphilic triblock co-polymer , containing diselenide as a redox-sensitive linkage. The linkage was smartly located at the hydrophilic-hydrophilic bridge in the co-polymer offering complete collapse of the micelle when exposed to the right trigger. The system was able to delay tumor growth and reduce toxicity in a breast cancer tumor model following intraperitoneal injection in mice.
