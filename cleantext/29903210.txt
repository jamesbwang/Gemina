  To investigate the long-term effects and the mechanism of neonatal bisphenol A ( BPA) exposure on mouse testicular structure and Boule expression. A total of 12 pregnant ICR mice were randomly divided into three groups: blank control group , negative control group ( corn oil) and BPA 100 μg/kg group. After delivery , BPA was given daily by neck subcutaneous injection to the offspring male mice from postnatal day ( PND 1) to PND 21. The offspring male mice were sacrificed on PND35 and PND 70. Morphological changes of testes were detected with hematoxylin-eosin staining , the level of Boule mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR , the expression of Boule protein was detected by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Compared with blank control group and negative control group , the diameter and the epithelium thickness of seminiferous epithelium in the same period ( PND 35 , PND 70) were significantly decreased and the lumen was significantly increased ( P < 0. 05) in the testes of BPA ( 100 μg/kg) group. In addition , the expressions of Boule mRNA and protein were decreased remarkably ( P < 0. 05 , P < 0. 01) in testes of BPA 100 μg/kg group. Neonatal BPA exposure has a long-term effect on mouse testicular development and may affect testicular development by decreasing the expression of Boule mRNA and protein in testes.
