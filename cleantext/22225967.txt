  First , we devise in this paper , a multi-regions discrete-time model which describes the spatial-temporal spread of an epidemic which starts from one region and enters to regions which are connected with their neighbors by any kind of anthropological movement. We suppose homogeneous Susceptible-Infected-Removed ( SIR) populations , and we consider in our simulations , a grid of colored cells , which represents the whole domain affected by the epidemic while each cell can represent a sub-domain or region. Second , in order to minimize the number of infected individuals in one region , we propose an optimal control approach based on a travel-blocking vicinity strategy which aims to control only one cell by restricting movements of infected people coming from all neighboring cells. Thus , we show the influence of the optimal control approach on the controlled cell. We should also note that the cellular modeling approach we propose here , can also describes infection dynamics of regions which are not necessarily attached one to an other , even if no empty space can be viewed between cells. The theoretical method we follow for the characterization of the travel-locking optimal controls , is based on a discrete version of Pontryagin 's maximum principle while the numerical approach applied to the multi-points boundary value problems we obtain here , is based on discrete progressive-regressive iterative schemes. We illustrate our modeling and control approaches by giving an example of 100 regions.
