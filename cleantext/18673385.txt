  In the absence of independent observational data , ecologists and paleoecologists use proxies for the Eltonian niches of species ( i.e. , the resource or dietary axes of the niche). Some dietary proxies exploit the fact that mammalian teeth experience wear during mastication , due to both tooth-on-tooth and food-on-tooth interactions. The distribution and types of wear detectible at micro- and macroscales are highly correlated with the resource preferences of individuals and , in turn , species. Because methods that quantify the distribution of tooth wear ( i.e. , analytical tooth wear methods) do so by direct observation of facets and marks on the teeth of individual animals , dietary inferences derived from them are thought to be independent of the clade to which individuals belong. However , an assumption of clade or phylogenetic independence when making species-level dietary inferences may be misleading if phylogenetic niche conservatism is widespread among mammals. Herein , we test for phylogenetic signal in data from numerous analytical tooth wear studies , incorporating macrowear ( i.e. , mesowear) and microwear ( i.e. , low-magnification microwear and dental microwear texture analysis). Using two measures of phylogenetic signal , heritability (
