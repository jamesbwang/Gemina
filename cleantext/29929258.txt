  The grasslands of northern China store a large amount of soil organic carbon ( SOC) , and the small changes in SOC stock could significantly affect the regional C cycle. However , recent estimates of SOC changes in this region are highly controversial. In this study , we examined the changes in the SOC density ( SOCD) in the upper 30 cm of the grasslands of northern China between the 1980s and 2000s , using an improved approach that integrates field-based measurements into machine learning algorithms ( artificial neural network ( ANN) and random forest<disease> ( RF)). The RF-generated SOCD averaged 5.55 kgCm
