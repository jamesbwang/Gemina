  In order to diagnose endometrial cancer preoperatively , outpatient endometrial biopsy with a curette is frequently performed owing to its convenience. However , in some cases , gynecologists fail to diagnose endometrial cancer via outpatient endometrial biopsy because of the cancer 's distribution in the uterus and its consistency. A 57-year-old Japanese woman ( gravida 4 para 4) presented with a 6-month history of light but intermittent postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. A malignant uterine tumor was strongly suspected after imaging using ultrasound examination and magnetic resonance imaging; however , a precise pathological diagnosis was not achieved despite multiple outpatient endometrial biopsies with the aid of office hysteroscopy. Based on an endometrial biopsy obtained using a cutting loop electrode on an 8.3-mm operative resectoscope , we reached a diagnosis of endophytic-type endometrial cancer , which is in accordance with the final pathological diagnosis after abdominal hysterectomy. Three months after her first visit to our hospital , total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic/para-aortic lymph node dissection were performed. Macroscopically , the endometrium was atrophic , and there was no obvious mass in the uterine cavity; however , microscopically , the cancer cells mainly existed in the deep myometrium and the final diagnosis was International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics ( FIGO) stage IB endometrial cancer. Operative biopsy of the uterine endometrium and deep myometrium using hysteroscopy confirmed an accurate preoperative diagnosis of uterine endometrial cancer specifically of the endophytic type.
