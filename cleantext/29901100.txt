  The aim of the present review was to summarize the current knowledge of the involvement of nestin in breast cancer ( BC) pathogenesis. Nestin is a member of the class VI family of intermediate filament proteins , originally identified as a marker of neural stem cells and subsequently demonstrated to be expressed in BC and other cancer types. In normal breast tissue , nestin is expressed in the basal/myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland. In BC , nestin identifies basal-like tumours and predicts aggressive behaviour and poor prognosis. Nestin expression has also been detected in BC stem cells and newly-formed tumour vessels , being a factor in promoting invasion and metastasis. The present review provides an up-to-date overview of the involvement of nestin in processes facilitating BC pathogenesis and progression.
