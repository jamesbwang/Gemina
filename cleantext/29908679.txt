  This study was designed to assess clinical characteristics and nutritional status of pediatric outpatients with cerebral palsy ( CP) and to determine prevalence of malnutrition based on physicians ' clinical judgment and on anthropometric data in relation to percentile reference values. A total of 1108 pediatric neurology outpatients ( mean ± SEM age: 7.2 ± 0.1 years , 59.3 % were males) diagnosed with CP were included in this cross-sectional , non-interventional multicenter single-visit study conducted between October 2015 and July 2016 at 20 centers across Turkey. Data on patient and CP characteristics , concomitant nonneuromotor impairments and gastrointestinal disorders as well as anthropometrics , outcome of nutritional status assessment ( via physicians ' clinical judgment and Gomez classification and Waterlow classification of anthropometric data) and physician 's view on nutritional care in CP patients were collected at a single visit. The most common CP etiology was asphyxia ( 62.5 %). The most common clinical category was spastic CP ( 87.5 %) with quadriplegic ( 54.0 %) topography and level V gross motor<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> ( 45.4 %) in most of patients. The prevalence of malnutrition was considered to be 57.2 % based on physicians ' clinical judgment , while shown to be 94.3 % ( 3rd degree in 86.7 %) according to Gomez classification of Neyzi weight for age ( WFA) percentiles and to be 91.3 % ( severe in 88.3 %) according to Waterlow classification of Neyzi height for age ( HFA) percentiles. In conclusion , our findings revealed high prevalence of malnutrition , while also emphasize the likelihood of overestimation of malnutrition in children with CP when anthropometric assessment was based on use of growth charts for general pediatric population. This large-scale survey provided valuable data regarding nutritional assessment practice and malnutrition prevalence among children with CP in Turkey , which may be utilized for future proactive strategies in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in this population.
