  We studied the resistance of Parmotrema austrosinense to UV-B stress. We focused on the effects of a high dose UV-B radiation on the content of chlorophylls , carotenoids and UV-B screening compounds. Photosynthetic parameters were measured by chlorophyll fluorescence ( potential and effective quantum yields , photochemical and non-photochemical quenching) and evaluated in control and UV-B-treated lichens. Lichens from two different locations in Cordoba , Argentina , were selected: ( i) high altitude and dry plots at ( Los Gigantes) and ( ii) lowland high salinity plots ( Salinas Grandes). UV-B treatment led to a decrease in the content of photosynthetic pigments and UV-B screens ( absorbance decrease in 220-350 nm) in the samples from Salinas Grandes , while in Los Gigantes samples , an increase in UV-B screen content was observed. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters showed a UV-B-induced decline in F
