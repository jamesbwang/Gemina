  In this work , the three-dimensional nitrogen-doped nanostructured carbons with hierarchical architectures ( 3D-NNCsHAs) with high density of defective sites , high surface area and pluralities of pore size distributions was prepared through the pyrolysis of sea-tangle ( Laminaria japonica<pathogen>) , an inexpensive , eco-friendly and abundant precursor. Benefitting from their structural uniqueness , a selective and sensitive ascorbic acid ( AA) sensor based on 3D-NNCsHAs was developed. Compared to the glassy carbon electrode ( GCE) and the carbon nanotubes modified GCE ( CNTs/GCE) , the 3D-NNCsHAs modified GCE ( 3D-NNCsHAs/GCE) presents higher performance towards the electrocatalysis and detection of AA , such as lower detection limit ( 1 μM) , wider linear range ( 10-4410 μM) and lower electrooxidation peak potential ( -0.02 V vs. Ag/AgCl). In addition , 3D-NNCsHAs/GCE also exhibits high anti-interference and anti-fouling abilities for AA detection. Particularly , the fabricated 3D-NNCsHAs/GCE is able to determine AA in real samples and the results acquired are satisfactory. Therefore , the 3D-NNCsHAs can be considered as a kind of novel electrode nanomaterial for the fabrication of selective and sensitive AA sensor for the extensive practical applications ranging from food analysis , to pharmaceutical industry and clinical test.
