  Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals ( NCs) as promising optoelectronic materials are intensively researched. However , instability is one of the biggest challenges needed to overcome before fulfill their practical applications. To improve their stability , we present a postsynthetic controlled phase transformation of CsPbBr
