  Flexible and highly ordered nanopillar arrayed electrodes have brought great interest for many electrochemical applications , especially to the biosensors , because of its unique mechanical and topological properties. Herein , we report an advanced method to fabricate highly ordered nanopillar electrodes produced by soft-/ photo-lithography and metal evaporation. The highly ordered nanopillar array exhibited the superior electrochemical and mechanical properties in regard with the wide space to response with electrolytes , enabling the sensitive analysis. As-prepared gold and silver electrodes on nanopillar arrays exhibit great and stable electrochemical performance to detect the amplified gene from foodborne pathogen of
