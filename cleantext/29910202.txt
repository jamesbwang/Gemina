  Material and energy constraints have had a major influence in the history of technology. However , prior research has surprisingly little to say about what these constraints actually are , how they emerge , and which are the mechanisms through which they influence technological change. This article studies a case where energy constraints were supposedly the source of a radical innovation in copper smelting in post-Second World War Finland. It finds that the constraints were significantly more ambiguous and socially constructed than the technologists themselves acknowledged , and highlights the context dependence of constraints and how technologists may perceive them. Technological feasibility influences the perception of constraints , and the perception of constraints influences what is found to be technologically feasible. This relationship is moderated by political power wielded by technologists.
