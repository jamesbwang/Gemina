  Panniculitis is a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by inflammation<symptom> of the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Panniculitis of breast tissue as the initial manifestation has rarely been reported and is often misdiagnosed. Breast panniculitis may cause substantial morbidity and early diagnosis and treatment are important for the prognosis of the disease. The present study has reported a case of panniculitis with inflammation<symptom> of the mammary glands as the initial presentation and provided a detailed description of ultrasonography , X-ray , computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging and other imaging features of breast panniculitis. The treatment and follow-up were also described. Following treatment with systemic corticosteroids combined with methotrexate and thalidomide for 2 months , the breast appeared to be normal without scar formation. The present case report provides a good reference for the future diagnosis and treatment of breast panniculitis.
