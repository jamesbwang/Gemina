  Gelatin hydrogels are used as tissue engineering scaffolds and systems for controlled release due to their inherent biodegradability and biocompatibility. In this study gelatin methacryloyl (- acetyl) ( GM/A) with various degrees of methacryloylation ( DM) and methacryl-modified heparin ( HepM) were cross-linked radically via thermal-redox initiation. Investigation of gel yields ( 79.4 % -85.8 %) and equilibrium degrees of swelling ( EDS; 564.8 % -750.3 %) by an experimental design approach suggested interaction effects between the applied HepM mass fraction and the DM of gelatin. HepM reduced the cross-linking effectivity ( gel yield) only when added to GM with low DM ( 83 % without HepM , 79 % with HepM) but not when added to GM with high DM. For EDS combined impacts of the physical and chemical nature of the applied biopolymers are indicated: the elevated hydrophilicity and low cross-linking potential of HepM enhanced EDS in GM gels with low DM ( Ø 1.1-fold increase) , and lowered the storage moduli of all GM formulations ( Ø 1.2-fold decrease). Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) loading before cross-linking of gels resulted in major loss of functional growth factor ( Ø 0.5 % release) , while loading after cross-linking was successful and significant release was detected over 28 days ( 6.4 % -10.4 % release). Release kinetics were mainly controlled by the VEGF concentration used for loading , and thus VEGF release and physico-chemical properties of the hydrogels can be tuned independently from each other in a broad range.
