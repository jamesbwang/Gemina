  The molecular process of RNA editing allows changes in RNA transcripts that increase genomic diversity. These highly conserved RNA editing events are catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as adenosine deaminases acting on double-stranded RNA ( ADARs). ADARs are necessary for normal development , they bind to over thousands of genes , impact millions of editing sites , and target critical components of the central nervous system ( CNS) such as glutamate receptors , serotonin receptors , and potassium channels. Dysfunctional ADARs are known to cause alterations in CNS protein products and therefore play a role in chronic or acute neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases as well as CNS cancer. Here , we review how RNA editing deficiency impacts CNS function and summarize its role during disease pathogenesis.
