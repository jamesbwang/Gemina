  Collaborative Care programs like the Improving Mood Promoting Access to Collaborative Care Program ( IMPACT) present an opportunity to support primary care for elderly depressed patients. The GermanIMPACT study evaluates whether this low-threshold model using short behavioral interventions that are conducted by care managers and supervised by a psychotherapist/psychiatrist , is as effective as in other countries. Besides effectiveness , the feasibility of the intervention is also essential for the implementation of the program. Care managers and supervisors were interviewed using a qualitative interview guide with questions concerning feasibility and effectiveness of the GermanIMPACT intervention , and the interviews were then evaluated using qualitative content analysis. The interviewees provided important information on how to optimize the realization of the intervention by selecting patients more carefully and by providing case managers with more training. Moreover , the intervention was described as being supportive of patients and as providing relief for general practitioners. Whereas interviewees wanted the intervention to be expanded to other disorders , they simultaneously highlighted the limits of the intervention. The present study provides practical information for implementing the GermanIMPACT model. Thus , specific recommendations for implementation into standard care can be derived.
