  The effect of flavors on carbonyl compound ( CC) emission factors ( EF) from electronic cigarettes ( ECs) vaping was investigated at the default vaping ( voltage) setting in all experiments using a total of 21 lab-made e-liquid samples ( five different types of retail flavorant bases: beverage/dessert/fruit/ mint/tobacco). Each flavorant base was added to a separate unflavored base composed of a 1:1 mixture of propylene glycol/vegetable glycerol ( PG/VG) at four levels ( 5/10/30/ 50 % ( v/v)). The e-liquid CC levels increased linearly with flavorant base content , 1.3-10.5 times ( R
