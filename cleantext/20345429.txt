  The aims of this study were to evaluate a subset of sleep-related cognitions and to examine whether dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep were associated with sleep quality in college students. A total of 1,333 college students were enrolled in this study by randomized cluster sampling. A brief version of Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale ( DBAS-16) was administered to college students at several colleges. Sleep quality was also assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI). The DBAS-16 scores were analyzed across different demographic variables , corresponding subscales of 7-item PSQI , and relevant sleep behavior variables. A total of 343 participants were poor sleepers , while 990 were good sleepers , as defined by PSQI. The DBAS-16 scores were lower in poor sleepers than in good sleepers ( 46.32 ± 7.851 vs 49.87 ± 8.349 , Dysfunctional beliefs about sleep are associated with sleep quality and should be discouraged , especially for females and nonmedical college students.
