  Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> readmissions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Adequate education on adherence and self-care behaviours can affect readmission rates positively and nurses are at the frontline of patient education. Such education is valuable when establishing heart<symptom> failure<symptom> programmes in developing countries , in light of the challenging socioeconomic circumstances in these. This study aimed to evaluate nurses ' heart<symptom> failure<symptom> knowledge , to assess patients ' baseline knowledge , and to evaluate the effectiveness of structured nurse-driven education. a total of 131 cardiac centre-based nurses and 30 chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients participated in the study in Kuwait. Patients were surveyed a second time 3 to 6 months later , while being followed at an advanced heart<symptom> failure<symptom> clinic by dedicated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> nurses. the majority of the nurses ( 80 %) had not received heart<symptom> failure<symptom> education previously , although they were able to recognise most heart failure symptoms. Significant improvement in patients ' knowledge was noted between the initial and follow-up surveys. establishing a dedicated advanced heart<symptom> failure<symptom> programme to care for patients in a developing country can result in significant improvement in disease awareness and self-care behaviours when led by well-trained heart<symptom> failure<symptom> nurses. More research is needed to determine if these findings are shared by other countries in the Middle-East and other developing countries.
