  This case-control study aimed to investigate the effect of rs11003125 in dental<disease> caries<disease> For this purpose , a total number of 404 individuals- from Fars Province in Iran- were studied. The technique of this research was the tetra-primer amplification-refractory mutation system ( ARMS)- PCR. Dental<disease> caries<disease> prevalence among the 404 individuals was assessed by counting the number of decayed , missing , and filled teeth. In this research , individuals were divided into two groups: cases ( n = 238) and controls ( n = 166) , and the peripheral blood samples were used to extract the genomic DNA. For genotyping of DNA , the tetra-primer ARMS-PCR method was conducted using specific primer pairs. While examining MBL2 rs11003125 polymorphism , we found significant differences in the genotype frequencies between the case and the control group. The pooled estimates indicated that the GG and GC genotypes of MBL2 rs11003125 polymorphism significantly increased , and therefore caries<disease> risk ( OR = 2.40 , 95 % CI = 1.31-4.40 , p = 0.004) under the dominant model. These findings suggested that polymorphism in MBL2 gene was associated with dental<disease> caries<disease> in Iranian adults. Further verification is needed with more ethnic groups and larger sample sizes to determine whether rs11003125 polymorphism is related to dental<disease> caries<disease> in other regions or not.
