  Separable affix verbs consist of a stem and a derivational affix , which , in some languages can appear together or in discontinuous , distributed form , e.g. , German `` aufgreifen '' and `` greifen... auf '' ( `` up-pick ( ing) '' and `` pick... up ''). Certain stems can combine with only certain affixes. However , many such combinations are evaluated not as clearly correct or incorrect , but frequently take an intermediate status with participants rating them ambiguously. Here , we mapped brain responses to combinations of verb stems and affixes realized in short sentences , including more and less common particle verbs , borderline acceptable combinations and clear violations. Event-related potential responses to discontinuous particle verbs were obtained for five affixes re-combined with 10 verb stems , situated within short , German sentences , i.e. , `` sie <stem> en es <affix> , '' English: `` they <stem> it <affix>. '' The congruity of combinations was assessed both with behavioral ratings of the stimuli and corpus-derived probability measures. The size of a frontal N400 correlated with the degree of incongruency between stem and affix , as assessed by both measures. Behavioral ratings performed better than corpus-derived measures in predicting N400 magnitudes , and a combined model performed best of all. No evidence for a discrete , right/wrong effect was found. We discuss methodological implications and integrate the results into past research on the N400 and neurophysiological studies on separable-affix verbs , generally.
