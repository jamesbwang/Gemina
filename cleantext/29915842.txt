  A size-asymmetric mean-field theory with ionic interactions is developed for the electric double layer of room temperature ionic liquid ( IL) electrolytes , based on the previous work on non-interacting ions ( Y. Han et al. , J. Phys.: Condens. Matter , 2014 , 26 , 284103). By solving the modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation with some simplified assumptions following a recent work ( Z. A. H. Goodwin et al. , Electrochim. Acta , 2017 , 225 , 190-197) , an analytical expression of differential capacitance can be derived , with a scaled electrode potential due to the ionic interactions. Compared with non-interacting ions , the main effect of ionic interactions is the insufficient screening of the electrode potential , and this depresses the differential capacitance compared with the non-interactive case.
