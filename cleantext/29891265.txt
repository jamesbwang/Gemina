  Stenosing tenosynovitis ( STS) is a common condition treated by hand surgeons. Limited evidence exists to support the nonsurgical management of STS. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate a cohort of patients with STS , and to determine the strategy for treating patients with this condition that is most cost effective in terms of dollars reimbursed by payers. Prospective data were collected on patients diagnosed with STS between March 2014 and September 2014. All patients were initially treated with a corticosteroid injection. Patients with persistent symptoms were given the option of injection or surgery. A maximum of 3 injections were offered. All patients were evaluated every 6 months through office appointments or phone calls. A cost analysis was performed in our cohort using actual reimbursement rates for injections , initial and established patient visits , and facility and physician fees for surgery , using the reimbursement rates from the 6 payers covering this patient cohort. Cost savings were calculated based on offering 1 , 2 , and 3 injections. Eighty-eight digits in 82 patients were followed for an average of 21.9 months ( range , 18.7-22.7 mo) after an initial corticosteroid injection. Thirty-five digits went on to surgical release , whereas 53 digits were treated nonsurgically. Had all patients initially undergone surgery , the cost would have totaled $ 169,088.98 ( $ 1,921 per digit). Offering up to 3 injections yielded a potential savings of $ 72,730 ( $ 826 per digit) or 43 % of the total cost. For the 33 patients who underwent more than 1 injection , offering a second injection yielded potential savings of $ 15,956 ( $ 484 per digit , 22.7 %) , and for the 7 patients presenting a third time , a third injection saved $ 1,986 ( $ 283 per digit , 14.5 %). Based on the data from our cohort , the efficient way to treat STS in terms of health care dollars spent is to offer up to 3 injections before surgical release. The first injection had the highest component of cost savings , at $ 826 per digit. Economic/Decision Analysis III.
