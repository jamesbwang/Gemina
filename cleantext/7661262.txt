  The Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) is the most commonly injured ligament around the knee and is best reconstructed with a biological graft. For ideal graft fixation , there should be sufficient initial strength to avoid failure of fixation and sufficient stiffness to restore the stability of the knee and to avoid gradual loosening in the post-operative period.When considering fixation of Bone Patellar Tendon Bone ( BPTB) grafts to the tibia , the interference screw is considered to be the gold standard. As an alternative , we have used of staples and stainless steel ( SS) wire to anchor the BPTB graft to the tibia and femur. The aim of this study was to assess the biomechanical efficacy of this fixation technique for anchoring the BPTB graft to the proximal tibia. We used a bovine model to compare three fixation techniques- interference screw , braided polyester sutures tied to a screw post and SS wire tied to a staple. Fifteen fresh bovine knees specimens were used for the study. The patella was fixed to a load cell and the construct was pre-tensioned to 40N to allow for creep of the tendon. The BPTB graft was fixed to the tibia using the three fixation techniques- the interference screw , polyester suture tied to a post , and SS wire anchored to a staple. After fixation , the graft was subjected to a single load to failure test , and the forces generated were recorded. The ultimate failure load ( the pullout strength) , stiffness , and mode of failure were noted. In the single load-to-failure biomechanical testing , The biomechanical properties of BPTB graft fixation with SS wire tied to a staple is similar to that of other fixation devices like the interference screw and suture post. This technique provides a simple , yet effective fixation for the graft- but needs further clinical assessment.
