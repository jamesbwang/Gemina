  We sought to assess the rehabilitation process , training , performance , and injury rates among those participating and not participating in the Tactical Human Optimization , Rapid Rehabilitation , and Reconditioning ( THOR3) program and determine injury risk factors. A survey inquiring about personal characteristics , injuries , physical performance , and THOR3 participation during the previous 12 months was administered to Army Special Operations Forces ( SOF) Soldiers. Based on responses to physical training , Soldiers were categorized into three groups: a traditional physical training ( TPT) group , a cross-training ( CT) group , and a THOR3 group. To identify potential injury risk factors , risk ratios and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs) were calculated. Backward- stepping multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess key factors associated with injury risk. The survey was completed by 328 male Soldiers. Most of the Soldiers ( 62 %) who scheduled an appointment with the physical therapist were seen within 1 day. Self-reported injury rates for the TPT , CT , and THOR3 groups were 70 % , 52 % , and 48 % , respectively. When controlling for personal characteristics , unit training , and fitness , the TPT group had a marginally higher risk of being injured than the THOR3 group ( odds ratio ( OR) , 2.72; 95 % CI , 0.86-8.59; p = .09). Soldiers who did not perform any unit resistance training ( ORnone/90 -160 min , 3.62; 95 % CI , 1.05-12.53; p = .04) or the greatest amount of resistance training ( OR > 160 min/90 -160 min , 3.44; 95 % CI , 1.64-7.20; p < .01) were more likely to experience an injury than the moderate-resistance training group. THOR3 appears to offer human performance optimization/injury prevention advantages over other SOF human performance programs.
