  We provide a comprehensive diffusion MRI dataset acquired with a novel biomimetic phantom mimicking human white matter. The fiber substrates in the diffusion phantom were constructed from hollow textile axons ( `` taxons '') with an inner diameter of 11.8 ± 1.2 µm and outer diameter of 33.5 ± 2.3 µm. Data were acquired on the 3 T CONNECTOM MRI scanner with multiple diffusion times and multiple q-values per diffusion time , which is a dedicated acquisition for validation of microstructural imaging methods , such as compartment size and volume fraction mapping. Minimal preprocessing was performed to correct for susceptibility and eddy current distortions. Data were deposited in the XNAT Central database ( project ID: dMRI_Phant_MGH).
