  SUR1 , one of the subunits of ATP-sensitive potassium ( K In this study , we detected the K Our results showed that the mRNA levels of SUR1 subunit were markedly increased by 35 % in WT α-Syn overexpression cells and by 31 % in A53T α-Syn overexpression cells , respectively. However , the mRNA levels of SUR2B and Kir6 .2 subunit have no obviously differences from the controls. We showed that the mRNA levels of SUR1 but not SUR2B or Kir6 .2 were selectively upregulated in MES23 .5 cells over-expressed with α-Syn. The findings demonstrated that the SUR1 overexpressed might be involved in the process of PD.
