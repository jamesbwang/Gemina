  Safety and effectiveness of daclatasvir ( DCV)/ asunaprevir ( ASV) dual therapy were demonstrated in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> ( CHC) genotype ( GT) 1b in phase III studies. This postmarketing surveillance ( PMS) was conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of DCV/ASV in Japanese patients with GT-1 CHC treated in routine clinical practice. This PMS was conducted between September 2014 and February 2017 at 261 centers in Japan. Patients with GT-1 CHC with or without compensated cirrhosis starting DCV and ASV dual therapy were observed from treatment initiation until 24 weeks after completing treatment. Safety and effectiveness assessments included incidence of adverse drug reactions ( ADRs) and sustained viral response ( SVR) rates at 24 weeks ( SVR24). Of 2820 patients ( median age , 71.0 years; ≥ 65 years , 73.1 %; female , 56.1 %; with compensated cirrhosis , 39.1 %) in the safety population , 726 ( 25.7 %) experienced 1063 ADRs and 47 ( 1.7 %) experienced 55 serious ADRs. Overall , 532 hepatic ADRs were reported; most hepatic ADRs occurred between > 4 and ≤ 12 weeks after treatment initiation. Subgroup analysis showed a higher incidence of ADRs in female , elderly , underweight , and renal function-impaired patients. SVR24 and SVR at 12 weeks ( SVR12) were 87.3 % ( 2216/2538) and 88.4 % ( 2284/2584) , respectively. Patients without ( SVR12 , 89.1 %; SVR24 , 87.9 %) and with ( SVR12 , 87.3 %; SVR24 , 86.3 %) compensated cirrhosis had similar SVR rates. Results from this large PMS indicate that DCV and ASV dual therapy is generally well tolerated and effective in routine clinical practice in Japanese patients with GT-1 CHC with or without compensated cirrhosis.
