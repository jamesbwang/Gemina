  Despite advances in screening , therapy , and surveillance that have improved survival rates , breast cancer is still the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer mortality among women ( 1). Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease rooted in a genetic basis and reflected in clinical behavior. The diversity of breast cancer hormone receptor status and the expression of surface molecules has guided therapy decisions for decades; however , subtype-specific treatment often yields diverse responses due to varying tumor evolution and malignant potential. Although understanding the mechanisms behind breast cancer heterogeneity is still a challenge , available evidence suggests that studying its metabolism has the potential to give valuable insight into the causes of these variations , as well as viable targets for intervention.
