  Central nervous system ( CNS) relapse of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) is a devastating event occurring in ~ 5 % of patients treated with R-CHOP. We hypothesized that adding lenalidomide to R-CHOP ( R2CHOP) may decrease the risk of CNS relapse. We analyzed records for patients with DLBCL from two R2CHOP trials. We assessed variables pertinent to the CNS-International Prognostic Index ( CNS-IPI) scoring system and classified patients into groups of low , intermediate , and high risk of CNS relapse. The 2-year CNS relapse rate for each risk group was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with reported rates in cohorts treated with contemporary chemoimmunotherapy. A total of 136 patients were included. Mean age was 65 and median follow-up was 48.2 months. 10.3 , 71.3 , and 18.4 % of patients were classified into low , intermediate , and high-risk CNS-IPI groups , respectively. Only one of 136 patients developed CNS relapse , corresponding to an incidence of 0.7 % and an estimated 2-year CNS relapse rate of 0.9 % for the entire R2CHOP cohort. The estimated 2-year CNS relapse rates for the low , intermediate , and high-risk groups were 0 , 0 , and 5.0 % , respectively. Frontline therapy with R2CHOP in patients with DLBCL is associated with a lower-than-expected rate of CNS relapse.
