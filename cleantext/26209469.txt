  Minimally invasive surgery ( MIS) has a significant and evolving role in the treatment of displaced intra articular calcaneal fractures ( DIACFs) , but there is limited literature on this subject. The objective was hence to assess the clinicoradiological outcomes of DIACFs fixed with an innovative open-envelope MIS technique. 42 closed Sanders Type 2 and 3; DIACFs were included in this study. The Open-envelope approach was developed , which is essentially a limited open , dual incision , modified posterior longitudinal approach allowing excellent visualisation and direct fragment manipulation. The main outcome measures were American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score ( AOFAS) hindfoot score and preoperative and postoperative radiological angles. The Bohler angle improved from a preoperative mean of 14.3 ° ( range 0 ° -28 °) to a postoperative mean of 32.46 ° ( range 22 ° -42 °). The Gissane angle improved from a preoperative mean of 135.83 ° to a postoperative mean of 128.33 °. The postoperative improvement in Bohler and Gissane angles was highly significant ( Open-envelope technique minimized soft tissue complications and achieved acceptable radiological reductions with good clinical outcomes.
