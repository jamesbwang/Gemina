  Cancers are a major source of morbidity and mortality for HIV-positive persons on combination antiretroviral therapy , while the clinical benefits of smoking cessation are not well established. Participants were followed from 1 January 2004 until first cancer diagnosis , death , or 1 February 2016. Smoking status was defined as ex ( < 1,1-2,2-3,3-5 , > 5 years since stopping) , current , and never smokers. Outcomes considered were any cancer , lung cancer , other smoking-related excluding lung and smoking-unrelated cancers. Adjusted incidence rate ratios ( aIRR) were calculated using Poisson regression , adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. 35442 persons from the D: A :D study contributed 309803 person years of follow-up. At baseline , 49 % of people were current smokers , 21 % were ex-smokers , 30 % had never smoked. Incidence of all cancers combined ( N = 2183) was highest < 1 year after smoking cessation compared to never smokers ( aIRR: 1.66 95 % CI: 1.37 , 2.02) and not significantly different from never smokers 1-2 years after cessation. Lung cancer incidence ( N = 271) was elevated < 1 year after cessation ( aIRR: 19.08 95 % CI: 8.10 , 44.95) and remained 8-fold higher 5 years after smoking cessation ( aIRR: 8.69 95 % CI: 3.40 , 22.18). Incidence of other smoking-related cancers ( N = 622) excluding lung was elevated in the first year after cessation ( aIRR: 2.06 95 % CI: 1.42 , 2.99) and declined to a level similar to non-smokers thereafter. Incidence of smoking-unrelated cancers ( N = 1290) was unrelated to smoking status. Lung cancer incidence remained elevated for more than 5 years after smoking cessation. Deterring uptake of smoking and smoking cessation efforts should be a priority to reduce the future risk of cancer.
