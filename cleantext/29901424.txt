  Tissue-engineered scaffolds are a powerful means of healing craniofacial bone defects arising from trauma or disease. Murine models of critical-sized bone defects are especially useful in understanding the role of microenvironmental factors such as vascularization on bone regeneration. Here , we demonstrate the capability of a novel multimodality imaging platform capable of acquiring in vivo images of microvascular architecture , microvascular blood flow , and tracer/cell tracking via intrinsic optical signaling ( IOS) , laser speckle contrast ( LSC) , and fluorescence ( FL) imaging , respectively , in a critical-sized calvarial defect model. Defects that were 4 mm in diameter were made in the calvarial regions of mice followed by the implantation of osteoconductive scaffolds loaded with human adipose-derived stem cells embedded in fibrin gel. Using IOS imaging , we were able to visualize microvascular angiogenesis at the graft site and extracted morphological information such as vessel radius , length , and tortuosity two weeks after scaffold implantation. FL imaging allowed us to assess functional characteristics of the angiogenic vessel bed , such as time-to-peak of a fluorescent tracer , and also allowed us to track the distribution of fluorescently tagged human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Finally , we used LSC to characterize the in vivo hemodynamic response and maturity of the remodeled microvessels in the scaffold microenvironment. In this study , we provide a methodical framework for imaging tissue-engineered scaffolds , processing the images to extract key microenvironmental parameters , and visualizing these data in a manner that enables the characterization of the vascular phenotype and its effect on bone regeneration. Such multimodality imaging platforms can inform optimization and design of tissue-engineered scaffolds and elucidate the factors that promote enhanced vascularization and bone formation.
