  IL-33 may play a role in the vascular remodelling of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension ( PH) but the precise mechanisms are still unclear. We hypothesized that hypoxia promotes expression of IL-33 and its receptor ST2 on vascular endothelial cells , which in turn leads to dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells contributing to PH. Immunohistochemistry showed that immunoreactivity for IL-33 and ST2 was significantly increased in lung tissue of murine model of hypoxia-induced PH ( HPH) and of subjects with bronchiectasis-PH. trans-Thoracic echocardiography showed that haemodynamic changes and right ventricular hypertrophy associated with HPH were significantly abrogated in St2
