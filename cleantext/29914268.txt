  As a method of measuring the phase difference between 2 signals , the phase lag index ( PLI) of the alpha and beta bands in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD) was investigated by using magnetoencephalography ( MEG). Eighteen PD patients were measured by MEG in the state of overnight withdrawal of levodopa and after levodopa treatment; meanwhile , Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS) III scale was evaluated. Compared with healthy controls , alpha ( 8-13 Hz) PLI in the frontal and parietal areas elevated in PD patients , while the elevation was reversed by the levodopa treatment. The alterations of the UPDRS III total scale ( r PD patients showed a higher mu PLI in the sensorimotor area relative to the healthy controls. The improvement of motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> of PD patients by levodopa was correlated to the inhibition of beta PLI in the sensorimotor area.
