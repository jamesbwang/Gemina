  The interest for grazing systems and the use of condensed tannins ( CT) as sources of natural antioxidants in animal diets has been increasing in recent years. The objective was to study the animal performance and carcass quality of the lambs according to the feeding strategy during lactation ( Indoor , grazing Alfalfa , grazing Sainfoin) and the inclusion of quebracho as a source of CT ( 50 g kg The feeding strategy during lactation only had effects on carcass quality. Indoor lambs had a greater dressing percentage and deposition of kidney fat than Sainfoin and Alfalfa lambs. The kidney fat of Sainfoin and Alfalfa fed lambs had a greater yellowness , chroma and carotenoid content than the fat of Indoor fed lambs ( P < 0.05) , whereas the subcutaneous fat colour was not affected by the feeding during lactation. The use of fat colour to trace the feeding strategy was assessed , and were found insufficiently accurate to implement its use. The inclusion of 50 g kg The feeding strategies during lactation had effect on the carcass characteristics , highlighting the importance of the dam 's diet during this period. The inclusion of quebracho in the lamb 's concentrate had minor effects. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
