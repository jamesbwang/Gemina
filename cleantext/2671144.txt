  Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that inhibits transpeptidation during cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala termini of lipid II. For long , it has been used as a last resort antibiotic. However , since the emergence of the first vancomycin-resistant enterococci in 1987 , vancomycin resistance has become widespread , especially in hospitals.
