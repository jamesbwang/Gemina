  The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible beneficial effects of diet supplementation with a highly concentrated and purified docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA) formula on human sperm function. We performed a prospective , randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled intervention study. One-hundred eighty human semen samples from sixty infertile patients recruited in a private assisted reproduction center were included. All samples were examined according to World Health Organization guidelines. We analyzed macroscopic and microscopic sperm parameters , oxidative stress , apoptosis , lipid peroxidation , mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation before and after supplementation with different DHA daily doses ( 0.5 , 1 and 2 g) or placebo for 1 and 3 months. No differences were found in traditional sperm parameters except for progressive sperm motility , with a significant increase after DHA ingestion after the first month with 1 or 2 g doses and after 3 months with 0.5 g of DHA. This effect was more evident in asthenozoospermic patients. No differences were found in any molecular semen parameter except oxidative stress , in which a slight benefit was observed after DHA treatment. In conclusion , this study support previous indications that highlight the importance of DHA supplementation as a means of improving sperm quality in asthenozoospermic men.
