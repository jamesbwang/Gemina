  Atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD) is a common and chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting up to 20 % of children and 3 % of adults worldwide. Although previous reports including genome-wide association study ( GWAS) approaches have identified several risk factors that appear to be associated with AD development , replication studies are lacking. In our current study , we replicated the associations between candidate susceptibility loci and AD. A total of 885 Korean subjects ( 425 AD patients and 460 unaffected controls) were genotyped for 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) from previous GWASs and meta-analyses of AD and from immune-related genes. Several SNPs showed significant associations with AD in the case-control analysis ( minimum P = 0.005 at rs17389644) , suggesting that these polymorphisms may be related to this disease. In addition , several SNPs showed significant signals ( minimum P = 0.004 at rs6473227) in severe AD compared to unaffected controls. In additional linear regression analysis , a few genotypes appeared to have potential effects on the SCORing AD ( SCORAD) values ( minimum P = 0.003 at rs13361382 on TMEM232) and immunoglobulin E ( IgE) levels ( minimum P < 0.0001 at rs4713555 near HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1) in AD patients. Our replication and extended study provide additional supporting information on the genetic associations ( especially , variants in TMEM232 and nearby to IL21 and HLA-DRB1/ HLA-DQA1) related to AD , its clinical severity and IgE involvement.
