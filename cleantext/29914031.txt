  Early Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) detection using cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) biomarkers has been recommended as enrichment strategy for trials involving mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) patients. To model a prodromal AD trial for identifying MRI structural biomarkers to improve subject selection and to be used as surrogate outcomes of disease progression. APOE ɛ4 specific CSF Aβ42/P-tau cut-offs were used to identify MCI with prodromal AD ( Aβ42/P-tau positive) in the WP5-PharmaCog ( E-ADNI) cohort. Linear mixed models were performed 1) with baseline structural biomarker , time , and biomarker × time interaction as factors to predict longitudinal changes in ADAS-cog13 , 2) with Aβ42/P-tau status , time , and Aβ42/P-tau status × time interaction as factors to explain the longitudinal changes in MRI measures , and 3) to compute sample size estimation for a trial implemented with the selected biomarkers. Only baseline lateral ventricle volume was able to identify a subgroup of prodromal AD patients who declined faster ( interaction , p = 0.003). Lateral ventricle volume and medial temporal lobe measures were the biomarkers most sensitive to disease progression ( interaction , p ≤ 0.042). Enrichment through ventricular volume reduced the sample size that a clinical trial would require from 13 to 76 % , depending on structural outcome variable. The biomarker needing the lowest sample size was the hippocampal subfield GC-ML-DG ( granule cells of molecular layer of the dentate gyrus) ( n = 82 per arm to demonstrate a 20 % atrophy reduction). MRI structural biomarkers can enrich prodromal AD with fast progressors and significantly decrease group size in clinical trials of disease modifying drugs.
