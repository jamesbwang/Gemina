  Genetic factors play an important role in the cervico-cerebral large-artery atherosclerotic stenosis ( LAS) , and ATP2B1 gene has been associated with the process of atherosclerosis disorders , such as coronary artery disease and arterial stiffness. But there is little information about the relationship between ATP2B1 gene and atherosclerosis in the intracranial arteries. We hereby investigated the association of common variants in ATP2B1 gene with LAS in asymptomatic Chinese hypertension patients. The stenosis of intracranial and extracranial arteries were evaluated in 899 subjects through computerized tomography angiography from the aortic arch to the skull base. A total of 11 ATP2B1 common variants were genotyped. Multivariate logistic regression was carried out in a dominant model with confounding factors adjusted. rs17249754-A ( OR = 0.43 , p = 0.0002) and rs1401982-G ( OR = 0.47 , p = 0.0007) were associated with decreased susceptibility of concurrent extra and intracranial stenosis even after Bonferroni correction. These two minor alleles were also significantly associated with less stenotic arteries and moderate-to-severe stenosis. rs17249754 and rs1401982 were associated with asymptomatic LAS in stroke-free Chinese hypertension patients and might benefit early recognition of LAS patients in clinical practice.
