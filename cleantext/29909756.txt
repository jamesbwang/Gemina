  Chinese tonic liquor is an important dietary supplement in daily use , but it often happens that illicitly adulterated drugs in Chinese tonic liquor could lead to food safety issues. In this survey , an analytical method consisting of a liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer ( LC-Q-TOF-MS) , coupled with quick easy cheap effective rugged safe ( QuEChERS) pretreatment , was established for identification of phosphodiesterase type 5 enzyme ( PDE-5) inhibitors in Chinese tonic liquors. 86 PDE-5 inhibitors were qualitatively analysed by employing information dependent acquisition mass spectrometry ( IDA-MS) in comparison with the accurate mass of the protonated molecular ion , isotopic pattern , library and chemical formula. This method was used to test 28 Chinese tonic liquor samples. The results revealed that the IDA-MS screening method is suitable for qualitative analysis of 86 PDE-5 inhibitors. Four samples were found to be adulterated with sildenafil , tadalafil , vardenafil , isopiperazinoafil , nortadalafil and desmethylsidenafil , which was 14.3 % of the tested samples.
