  Many patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) and elevated stroke risk are not prescribed oral anticoagulation ( OAC) despite evidence of benefit. Identification of factors associated with OAC non-prescription could lead to improvements in care. Using NCDR PINNACLE , a United States-based ambulatory cardiology registry , we examined factors associated with OAC non-prescription in patients with non-valvular AF at elevated stroke risk ( CHA In this registry of AF patients , older patients at elevated stroke and low<symptom> bleeding<symptom> risk were commonly treated with OAC. However , a variety of factors were associated with OAC non-prescription. Specifically , antiplatelet use was prevalent and associated with the highest likelihood of OAC non-prescription. Future studies are warranted to understand provider and patient rationale that may underlie observed associations with OAC non-prescription.
