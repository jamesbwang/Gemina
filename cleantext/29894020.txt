  Skin diseases represent one of the most common work-related diseases and may have a detrimental effect on social , personal and occupational aspects of life. Contact dermatitis<disease> , which comprises predominately irritant contact dermatitis<disease> ( ICD) and allergic contact dermatitis<disease> ( ACD) accounts for vast majority of occupational skin diseases , especially in occupations associated with frequent skin contact with irritants and contact allergens. Although ICD and ACD have similar clinical manifestation , their pathophysiology and the role of the skin barrier is different. In ICD , perturbation of the skin barrier is the primary event which sets into motion diverse metabolic processes and triggers activation of innate immunity without involvement of adaptive immune system. In ACD , a type IV hypersensitivity<disease> reaction induced by contact allergens , the skin barrier impairment may evoke innate signaling pathways during the sensitization phase required for the activation of T-cell adaptive response. Thus , skin barrier impairment may increase the risk of ICD or ACD not only because of enhanced permeability and ingress of irritants and allergens , but also by generation of innate immune signal needed for the induction of allergic response. Hence , an efficient way to prevent CD is to avoid skin barrier damage in the workplace. This review focuses on the skin barrier , how it is affected by skin irritants and how its impairment contributes to development of ICD and ACD. This article is protected by copyright.
