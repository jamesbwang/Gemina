  Self-criticism is a transdiagnostic process associated with a range of psychological problems. This uncontrolled pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a six-session intervention using methods from compassion-focused therapy to reduce self-criticism , as well as investigating changes in a range of outcome measures. Twenty-three university student participants with significant impaired functioning associated with high levels of self-criticism received six individual weekly treatment sessions and a 2-month follow-up appointment. Acceptability was assessed through participant feedback. The intervention appeared to be feasible in terms of recruitment and retention of participants , and participant feedback indicated that overall the intervention seemed acceptable. There were statistically significant improvements between pre- and post-intervention for self-criticism , functional impairment , mood , self-esteem and maladaptive perfectionism with medium to large effect sizes at both post-intervention and follow-up. Gains were maintained or increased between post-treatment and 2-month follow-up. The study showed preliminary evidence of effectiveness of a compassion-focused intervention for self-critical students which appeared to be a feasible and acceptable treatment approach. This intervention now requires investigation in a randomized controlled trial.
