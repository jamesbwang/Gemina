  Vision is dependent on extracting intricate features of the visual information from the outside world , and complex visual computations begin to take place as soon as at the retinal level. In multiple studies on salamander retinas , the responses of a subtype of retinal ganglion cells , i.e. , fast/biphasic-OFF ganglion cells , have been shown to be able to realize multiple functions , such as the segregation of a moving object from its background , motion anticipation , and rapid encoding of the spatial features of a new visual scene. For each of these visual functions , modeling approaches using extended linear-nonlinear cascade models suggest specific preceding retinal circuitries merging onto fast/biphasic-OFF ganglion cells. However , whether multiple visual functions can be accommodated together in a certain retinal circuitry and how specific mechanisms for each visual function interact with each other have not been investigated. Here , we propose a physiologically consistent , detailed computational model of the retinal circuit based on the spatiotemporal dynamics and connections of each class of retinal neurons to implement object motion sensitivity , motion anticipation , and rapid coding in the same circuit. Simulations suggest that multiple computations can be accommodated together , thereby implying that the fast/biphasic-OFF ganglion cell has potential to output a train of spikes carrying multiple pieces of information on distinct features of the visual stimuli.
