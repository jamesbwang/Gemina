  This study investigated the association of PM2 .5 exposure with VEGF by conducting a systematic review of existing literature and performing a meta-analysis. We searched all the studies published in the Cochrane Library , PUBMED , Embase , China National Knowledge Infrastructure China National Knowledge Infrastructure , and WanFang Electronic Database before June 2017. Finally six studies were identified. It confirmed that the increase in VEGF ( β = 1.23 pg/ml , 95 % CI: 0.45 , 2.01) was significantly associated with the PM2 .5 mass concentration of 10 μg/m3. Studies from Canada showed that PM2 .5 exposure statistically elevated the level of VEGF level that an increase of 1.20 pg/ml ( 95 % CI: 0.88 , 1.52) in VEGF was associated with per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2 .5 concentration. Other subgroup analyses indicated that the effects of PM2 .5 exposure on VEGF differed per the in different exposure assessment methods , study designs , and study settings. It was concluded that elevated VEGF levels was significantly positive associated with PM2 .5 exposure. Exposure assessment methods and study countries were the major sources of heterogeneity among studies.
