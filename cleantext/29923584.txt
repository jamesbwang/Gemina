  A 2D layered structure ( ( Co4 ( TC4A) Cl) ( L) 2) ( ( CH3CH2) 4N)) n ( + solvent) ( 1) has been solvothermally synthesized by assembly of Co4-TC4A ( H4TC4A = p-tert-butylthiacalix ( 4) arene) subunits and L ( H2L = 4- ( 1H-tetrazol-5-yl) benzoic acid) ligands. The layers arranged in an edge-to-edge ( AAAA) manner , which represented the only example of 2D porous coordination polymers ( PCPs) with 1D uniform channels of metal-thiacalix ( 4) arene. The activated PCP 1 exhibited high selectivity for C3H8/C2H6 , C3H6/C2H4 , and C3H8/C2H4 , which makes it a competitive porous material for C3/C2 alkane and/or olefin separations. Frequency response investigations for C3H8 and C2H6 indicated that the 1D channels and inter-layer voids of the activated crystalline samples are primarily responsible for the observed gas adsorption and separation performances.
