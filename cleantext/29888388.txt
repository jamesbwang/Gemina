  To utilize the potential of non-thermal plasma technologies for food safety control and sanitation , the inactivation mechanisms of Bacillus<pathogen> amyloliquefaciens spores by non-thermal plasma of ambient air ( NTP-AA) were investigated using scanning electron microscopy , atomic force microscopy , attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with chemometric analysis and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , aiming to probe both the morphological and biochemical changes occurring in spores during the kinetic inactivation process. Kinetic analysis indicates that there is no intrinsic D-value ( i.e. time required to inactivate 90 % of the spores) in spore inactivation by NTP-AA because we observed non-linear ( biphasic) inactivation kinetics and , in addition , the inactivation rate depended on the initial spore concentration and how the spores were exposed to the reactive species in the NTP-AA. The presence of suitable amount of water in the NTP-AA field accelerates spore inactivation. Progressive erosion of spore surface by NTP-AA with ensuing or concomitant biochemical damage , which includes the alteration of structural proteins , internal lipids and the loss of dipicolinic acid content from the spore core , represent the main mechanisms of inactivation , and there is evidence that reactive NTP-AA species could penetrate the cortex and reach the core of spores to cause damage.
