  Disparities in police responses to Black and White people have received significant research and public attention in recent years. This study examines self-reported accounts of exposure to and perceptions of police use of force among Black and White ethnic groups by sex and income level. Using bivariate and multivariate approaches , we analyzed data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics 2011 Police-Public Contact Survey , a measure administered to a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents. Participants were asked a series of questions about their most recent contact with police during a 12-month period. Our analyses were limited to Black ( For Black residents , being male and having an income under $ 20,000 significantly increased the risk for exposure to police use of force during a street stop. For White residents , being male , having an income under $ 20,000 , or being age 35 or older significantly increased the risk for exposure to police use of force during a street stop. Future research will benefit from additional attention to the cumulative impact of police use of force and how experience with police use of force shapes U.S. residents ' understanding of and expectations for procedural justice.
