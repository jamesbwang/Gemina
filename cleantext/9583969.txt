  To evaluate King Hussein Cancer Center experience in using Iodine-125 COMS radioactive plaque for treatment of Uveal Melanoma in Jordan. Retrospective case series of eyes with uveal melanoma treated by Iodine-125 COMS radioactive plaque therapy. Data collection required access to medical , radiology , Labs and pathology reports. Main outcomes studied includes: Demographics , tumor features , eye salvage , visual outcome , metastasis , and mortality. Between September 2008 and March 2015 , 28 eyes for 28 patients had intraocular uveal melanoma and treated by Iodine-125 radioactive plaque therapy. The mean age at diagnosis was 48 years and 16 ( 57 %) were males. The mean tumor thickness was 8 mm ( range: 4-13 mm) , and 27 ( 96 %) patients had medium or large size tumor. The radioactive plaques used had a median size of 16 mm ( range: 12-20 mm). The mean apical dose was 83.5 Gy ( range 81-87 Gy) , and the median radiation rate was 7.25 ( range: 4.5-13). At median follow up of 2 years ( range 0.5-7 years) , eye salvage rate was 93 %. Four ( 15 %) patients had distance metastasis , and 3 ( 11 %) were dead. Fifty percent of patient had visual acuity better than 20/200 at the last date of follow up. Our preliminary results are encouraging and are comparable to another countries worldwide. The use of Iodine-125 COMs plaque therapy at the inspection of implementation of plaque therapy in the developing countries can lead to eye salvage in more than 90 % of cases , and reserves functional vision in more than 50 % of cases.
