  Reservoirs tend to have enhanced methylmercury ( MeHg) concentrations compared to natural lakes and rivers , and water level fluctuations can promote MeHg production. Until now , little research has been conducted on the effects of microorganisms in soils for the formation of MeHg during different drying and flooding alternating conditions in the Three Gorges Reservoir ( TGR). This study aimed to understand how water level fluctuations affect soil microbial composition and mercury concentrations , and if such microbial variations are related to Hg methylation. The results showed that MeHg concentrations and the ratios of MeHg to THg ( MeHg %) in soils were higher in the seasonally drying and flooding alternating areas ( DFAs , 175-155m) than those in the non-inundated ( NIAs , > 175m) and inundated areas ( IAs , < 145m). However , MeHg % in all samples was less than 1 % , indicating that the Hg methylation activity in the soils of the TGR was under a low level. 454 high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons showed that soil bacterial abundance and diversity were relatively higher in DFA compared to those in NIA and IA , and microbial community composition varied in these three areas. At the family level , those groups in Deltaproteobacteria and Methanomicrobia that might have many Hg methylators were also showed a higher relative abundance in DFA , which might be the reason for the higher MeHg production in these areas. Overall , our results suggested that seasonally water level fluctuations can enhance the microbial abundance and diversity , as well as MeHg production in the TGR.
