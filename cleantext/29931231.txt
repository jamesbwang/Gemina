  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in developed and developing countries. The use of synbiotics has been proposed as a probable management strategy for patients with NAFLD. We investigated the effects of synbiotic yogurt on hepatic steatosis and liver enzymes as primary outcomes and on oxidative stress markers , adipokine concentration , and gut peptide concentration as secondary outcomes in patients with NAFLD. In this 24-wk , open-label , randomized controlled clinical trial , 102 patients ( 50 men and 52 women; mean age: 40 y; body mass index ( in kg/m2) ( mean ± SD): 31.2 ± 4.9) were randomly assigned to 3 groups , including 2 intervention groups and 1 control group. The intervention groups consumed 300 g synbiotic yogurt containing 108 colony-forming units Bifidobacterium<pathogen> animalis/mL and 1.5 g inulin or conventional yogurt daily and were advised to follow a healthy lifestyle ( i.e. , diet and exercise). The control group was advised to follow a healthy lifestyle alone. We evaluated differences between groups in liver function measures by using repeated-measures ANOVA , ANCOVA , and logistic regression. At the end of the study , the grades of NAFLD , as determined by ultrasonography , showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group compared with the conventional and control groups ( P < 0.001). The following significant mean ± SD decreases were seen in the synbiotic , conventional , and control groups , respectively: serum concentration of alanine aminotransferase ( -14.5 ± 15.6 compared with 4.6 ± 15.4 and 3.1 ± 14.4 IU/L; P = 0.008) , aspartate aminotransferase ( -7.5 ± 6.1 compared with 3.0 ± 8.2 and 3.1 ± 5.7 IU/L; P < 0.001) , alkaline phosphatase ( -26.2 ± 16.8 compared with 3.4 ± 30.1 and 1.5 ± 31.9 IU/L; P = 0.024) , and γ-glutamyltransferase ( -6.0 ± 6.0 compared with 1.0 ± 6.4 and 7.6 ± 11.4 IU/L; P < 0.001). Synbiotic yogurt consumption improved hepatic steatosis and liver enzyme concentrations in patients with NAFLD. This trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials website ( www.irct.ir) as IRCT2017020932417N2.
