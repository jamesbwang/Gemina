  Multidrug resistance ( MDR) , which leads tumors resistance to traditional anticancer drugs , can cause the failure of chemotherapy treatments. In this work , we present a new way to overcome this problem using smart multifunctional graphene-based drug delivery systems which can target subcellular organelles and show synergistic hyperthermia<symptom> and chemotherapy. Mitochondria-targeting ligands are conjugated onto the doxorubicin-loaded , polyglycerol-covered nanographene sheets to actively accumulate them inside the mitochondria after charge-mediated cellular internalization. Upon near-infrared irradiation ( NIR) , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) synthesis and mitochondrial function were inhibited and doxorubicin released into the cellular interior. The hyperthermia-accelerated drug release led to a highly selective anticancer efficiency , confirmed by in vitro and in vivo experiments.
