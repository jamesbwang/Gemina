  The study determined the effect of ascorbic acid ( administered orally and intramuscularly) in short-term transportation stress. Twenty-four apparently healthy Kalahari goats were grouped into four groups ( A , B , C , and D) of 6 animals each: Group A- untreated and unexposed to stress; Group B- treated with 200 mg/kg Vitamin C orally and exposed to 2 h transportation stress; Group C- treated with Vitamin C 200 mg/kg intramuscularly and exposed to 2 h transportation stress; and Group D- untreated and exposed to 2 h transportation stress. The animals were stocked using standards stipulated by the Nigerian Animal Disease Control Act and transported at 40 km/h. Cortisol and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) were assayed using quantitative sandwich ELISA. Classical stress hematological parameters and antioxidative stress markers such as glutathione s-transferase , superoxide dismutase , and malondialdehyde were determined. Heart rate variability ( HRV) was also assessed. The route of ascorbic acid administration did not influence the expression of IL-6 , and changes in cortisol surge , antioxidative stress markers , and other hematological parameters in Kalahari goats though Group C goats showed higher HRV values ( p < 0.05) than others. This gives credence to the enhanced cardiac responsiveness and stress survivability in Kalahari goats. Both routes could be used in the administration of ascorbic acid. Kalahari goats exposed to short-term stress; however , the intramuscular route had better heart variability and thus improved the survivability of the animals.
