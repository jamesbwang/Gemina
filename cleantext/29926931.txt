  Characterising the activated oncogenic signalling that leads to advanced breast cancer is of clinical importance. Here , we showed that SET domain , bifurcated 1 ( SETDB1) , a histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase is aberrantly expressed and behaves as an oncogenic driver in breast cancer. SETDB1 enhances c-MYC and Cyclin D1 protein expression via promoting the internal ribosome entry site ( IRES) mediated translation of MYC/CCND1 mRNA , resulting in prominent signalling of c-MYC to promote cell cycle progression and confers a growth/self-renewal advantage to breast cancer cells. The activated c-MYC/BMI1 axis is essential for SETDB1-mediated breast tumorigenesis , because silencing either c-MYC or BMI1 profoundly abolishes the enhanced growth/colony formation conferred by SETDB1. Furthermore , c-MYC protein directly binds to the SETDB1 promoter region and enhances its transcription , suggesting a positive regulatory interplay occurs between SETDB1 and c-MYC. This study identified SETDB1 as a prominent oncogene and characterized the underlying mechanism of SETDB1 in driving breast cancer , and therefore provides a therapeutic rationale for targeting SETDB1/BMI1 signalling in breast cancer.
