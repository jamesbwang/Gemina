  The importance of nocturnal hypoventilation in the development of cardiovascular comorbidity ( CVM) in patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome<disease> ( OHS) is controversial. We recently hypothesized that nocturnal hypoventilation may have a protective effect on cardiovascular comorbidity in OHS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the link between nocturnal hypoventilation ( nHyp) and CVM in patients with OHS. We performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of 60 patients with OHS. The initial population was divided into two groups: a) 31 subjects with OHS and nHyp ( nhOHS); b) 29 individuals with OHS without nHyp ( wnhOHS). All patients had also OSA. Anthropometric data , medical history , electrocardiogram , pulmonary function testing , arterial blood gas test and sleep recordings were collected. Patients with nhOHS , compared to those wnhOHS , showed higher values of PaCO2 ( 48.75 ± 3.78 vs 46.91 ± 2.09; p = 0.023) , lower percentage of ischemic heart disease ( 3.2 % vs 20.7 %; p = 0.042) , higher ODI ( 55.10 ± 28.76 vs 38.51 ± 23.21; p = 0.017) , higher total sleep time with SpO2 < 90 %- TST 90- ( 53.58 ± 26.90 vs 25.64 ± 21.67; p = 0.000). Moreover , individuals in nhOHS group showed a significantly different ( p = 0.031) distribution of the three ODI tertiles 0-32 , 33-72 , > 72 compared to wnhOHS group ( 19.4 % vs 37 % , 41.9 % vs 51.7 % , 38.7 % vs 10.3 % , respectively). Subsequent discriminant analysis correctly classified nhOHS and wnhOHS in 66.7 % of the cases. Ours is the first study analysing the correlation between nocturnal hypoventilation and CVM in patients with OHS. We showed that nocturnal hypoventilation in OHS may have a protective effect on cardiovascular morbidity , in particular on ischemic cardiac disease.
