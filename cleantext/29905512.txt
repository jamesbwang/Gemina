  OBJECTIVE Cranioplasty implants should be widely available , low in cost , and customized or easy to mold during surgery. Although autologous bone remains the first choice for repair , it can not always be used due to infection , fragmentation , bone resorption , or other causes , which led to use of synthetic alternatives. The most frequently used allogenic material for cranial reconstructions with long-term results is polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA). Three-dimensional printing technology has allowed the production of increasingly popular customized , prefabricated implants. The authors describe their method and experience with a customized PMMA prosthesis using a precise and reliable low-cost implant that can be customized at any institution with open-source or low-cost software and desktop 3D printers. METHODS A review of 22 consecutive patients undergoing CT-based , low-cost , customized PMMA cranioplasty over a 1-year period at a university teaching hospital was performed. Preoperative data included patient sex and age; CT modeling parameters , including the surface area of the implant ( defect); reason for craniectomy; date ( s) of injury and/or resections; the complexity of the defect; and associated comorbidities. Postoperative data included morbiditiy and complications , such as implant exposure , infection , hematoma , seroma , implant failure , and seizures<symptom>; the cost of the implant; and cosmetic outcome. RESULTS Indications for the primary craniectomy were traumatic brain injury ( 16 , 73 %) , tumor resection ( 3 , 14 %) , infection ( 1 , 4 %) , and vascular ( 2 , 9 %). The median interval between previous surgery and PMMA cranioplasty was 12 months. The operation time ranged from 90 to 150 minutes ( mean 126 minutes). The average cranial defect measured 65.16 cm
