  Spinal excitability in humans is inhibited by both passively holding a static position with the muscle lengthened ( static stretching) and by a single non-active lengthening movement. However , whilst immediately after a passive lengthening movement the inhibition persists for several seconds , there seem to be an immediate recovery following static stretching. This result is counter intuitive and could be attributed to methodological procedures. Indeed , differently to what has been done until now , in order to study whether static stretching has a transient effect on the neuromuscular pathway , the procedure should be repeated many times and measurements collected at different time points after stretching. In the present study we repeated 60 times 30 s static stretching of ankle plantar flexors<symptom> and measured tap reflex ( T-reflex) , Hoffman reflex ( H-reflex) , and motor evoked potentials ( MEPs) from the Soleus muscle at several time points , starting from immediately after until 30 s following the procedure. T-reflex was strongly inhibited ( range 31-91 % ,
