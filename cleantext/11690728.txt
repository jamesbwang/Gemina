  SWOG S0421 was a large randomized trial comparing docetaxel/prednisone plus placebo ( DPP) to docetaxel/prednisone plus atrasentan over 12 cycles for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC). The current report presents the PRO results for this trial , an important secondary endpoint. The trial specified two primary PRO endpoints. Palliation of worst pain was based on the Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI) , where a 2 point difference is defined as clinically meaningful. Improvement of functional status was based on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Prostate Cancer Trial Outcome Index ( FACT-P TOI); a 5-point difference has been defined as clinically meaningful. We compared rates by arm using chi-square tests. Longitudinal analyses using linear mixed models addressed changes by arm over time. Four-hundred eighty-nine patients on each arm were evaluable for PRO endpoint data. There were no differences by arm in clinically meaningful pain palliation ( 41.7 % for DPP vs. 44.0 % for DPA , The SWOG S0421 PRO data showed little evidence of clinically meaningful differences by arm in either pain palliation or functional status.
