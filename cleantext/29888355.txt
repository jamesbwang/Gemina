  Radioactive gaseous ruthenium tetroxide ( RuO4) can be released into the environment in the case of a severe nuclear accident. Using periodic dispersion corrected density functional theory calculations , we have investigated for the first time the adsorption behavior of RuO4 into prototypical porous materials , Metal-Organic Frameworks ( MOFs) and zeolites , with the aim of mitigating ruthenium releases to the outside. For the MOFs , we have screened a set of six structures ( MIL-53 ( Al) , MIL-120 ( Al) , HKUST-1 ( Cu) , UiO-66 ( Zr) , UiO-67 ( Zr) and UiO-68 ( Zr)) , while for the zeolites two structures have been selected: mordenite ( MOR) with Si/Al ratios of 11 and 5 , and faujasite ( FAU) with a Si/Al ratio of 2.4. The DFT calculations show that the nature of the porous materials does not have a significant effect on the adsorption energy of RuO4 compounds and that the main interaction is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds. For the tested materials , computational results show that the interaction energies of RuO4 reach their maximum with the hydrated form of HKUST-1 ( Cu) ( -114 kJ mol-1) due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the oxygen atoms of RuO4.
