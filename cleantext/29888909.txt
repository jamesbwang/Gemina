  The formation of an electric double layer in ionic liquid ( IL) can electrostatically induce charge carriers and/or intercalate ions in and out of the lattice which can trigger a large change of the electronic , optical , and magnetic properties of materials and even modify the crystal structure. We present a systematic study of ionic liquid gating of exfoliated 2D molybdenum trioxide ( MoO
