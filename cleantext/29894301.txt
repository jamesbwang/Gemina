  The purpose of our study was to quantify the fetal myocardial function in pregnant women with diabetic diseases ( FDM) and in normal controls ( FC) using speckle tracking echocardiography ( STE). In this prospective study , the myocardial strain and dyssynchrony were analyzed using STE in a transversal four-chamber view in 180 fetuses ( 53 FDM , 127 FC) between 19 and 39 weeks of gestation. The measurements of the global and segmental longitudinal strain of both chambers ( 2C) and of the single left chamber ( 1C) were executed offline via QLab 10.5 ( Philips Medical Systems , Andover , MA , USA). We assessed dyssynchrony as the time difference between peaks in strain in the mid segments of both chambers ( interventricular dyssynchrony , 2C_DYS) and of the single left chamber ( intraventricular dyssynchrony , 1C_DYS). Measurements were feasible with a high median frame rate of 199 frames/s ( 1st quartile: 174 , 3rd quartile: 199). The global and segmental myocardial longitudinal strain of 2C and 1C were decreased and 2C_DYS and 1C_DYS were increased in pregnancies with diabetes compared to normal controls. Our study demonstrates that fetal hearts affected by maternal diabetes mellitus ( DM) show low myocardial strain values and high interventricular dyssynchrony. Two-chamber interventricular dyssynchrony has the potential to become a diagnostic marker for DM.
