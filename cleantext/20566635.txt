  Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) are promising novel antibiotics since they have shown antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacterial species , including multiresistant bacteria; however , toxicity is the major barrier to convert antimicrobial peptides into active drugs. A profound and proper understanding of the complex interactions between these peptides and biological membranes<symptom> using biophysical tools and model membranes<symptom> seems to be a key factor in the race to develop a suitable antimicrobial peptide therapy for clinical use. In the search for such therapy , different combined approaches with conventional antibiotics have been evaluated in recent years and demonstrated to improve the therapeutic potential of AMPs. Some of these approaches have revealed promising additive or synergistic activity between AMPs and chemical antibiotics. This review will give an insight into the possibilities that physicochemical tools can give in the AMPs research and also address the state of the art on the current promising combined therapies between AMPs and conventional antibiotics , which appear to be a plausible future opportunity for AMPs treatment.
