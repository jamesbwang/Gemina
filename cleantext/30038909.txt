  Cellular catabolism is the cell capacity to generate energy from various substrates to sustain its function. To optimize this energy production , cells are able to switch between various metabolic pathways in accordance to substrate availability via a modulation of several regulatory enzymes. This metabolic flexibility is essential for the healthy heart , an organ requiring large quantities of ATP to sustain its contractile function. In type 2 diabetes , excess of non-glucidic nutrients such as fatty acids , branched-chain amino-acids , or ketones bodies , induces cardiac metabolic inflexibility. It is characterized by a preferential use of these alternative substrates to the detriment of glucose , this participating in cardiomyocytes dysfunction and development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Identification of the molecular mechanisms leading to this metabolic inflexibility have been scrutinized during last decades. In 1963 , Randle demonstrated that accumulation of some metabolites from fatty acid metabolism are able to allosterically inhibit regulatory steps of glucose metabolism leading to a preferential use of fatty acids by the heart. Nevertheless , this model does not fully recapitulate observations made in diabetic patients , calling for a more complex model. A new piece of the puzzle emerges from recent evidences gathered from different laboratories showing that metabolism of the non-glucidic substrates induces an increase in acetylation levels of proteins which is concomitant to the perturbation of glucose transport. The purpose of the present review is to gather , in a synthetic model , the different evidences that demonstrate the role of acetylation in the inhibition of the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cardiac muscle.
