  The complex design of multifunctional nanomedicine is beneficial to overcome the multiple biological barriers of drug delivery , but it also presents additional hurdles to clinical translation ( e.g. , scaling-up and quality control). To address this dilemma , we employed a simple imidazole-bearing polymer micelle for enhanced cellular uptake , facilitated endosomal escape , and on-demand release of a model drug , SN-38. The micelles were crosslinked by the reversible imidazole/Zn
