  Drug development for front-line treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) has been stagnant for almost three decades. Traditional cell culture methods for primary drug screening do not always accurately reflect clinical disease. To overcome this barrier , we grew a panel of EOC cell lines in three-dimensional ( 3D) cell cultures to form multicellular tumor spheroids ( MCTS). We characterized these MCTS for molecular and cellular features of EOC and performed a comparative screen with cells grown using two-dimensional ( 2D) cell culture to identify previously unappreciated anti-cancer drugs. MCTS exhibited greater resistance to chemotherapeutic agents , showed signs of senescence and hypoxia , and expressed a number of stem cell-associated transcripts including ALDH1A and CD133. Using a library of clinically repurposed drugs , we identified candidates with preferential activity in MCTS over 2D cultured cells. One of the lead compounds , the dual COX/LOX inhibitor licofelone , reversed the stem-like properties of ovarian MCTS. Licofelone also synergized with paclitaxel in ovarian MCTS models and in a patient-derived tumor xenograft ( PDX) model. Importantly , the combination of licofelone with paclitaxel prolonged the median survival of mice ( > 141 days) relative to paclitaxel ( 115 days) , licofelone ( 37 days) , or vehicle ( 30 days). Increased efficacy was confirmed by Mantel-Haenszel hazard ratio compared to vehicle ( HR = 0.037) and paclitaxel ( HR = 0.017). These results identify for the first time an unappreciated , anti-inflammatory drug that can reverse chemotherapeutic resistance in ovarian cancer , highlighting the need to clinically evaluate licofelone in combination with front-line chemotherapy in primary and chemotherapy-refractory EOC.
