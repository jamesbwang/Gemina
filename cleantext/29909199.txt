  We report on direct label-free protein detection in high ionic strength solution and human plasma by a dual-gate nanoribbon-based ion-sensitive field-effect transistor ( NR-ISFET) biosensor system with excellent sensitivity and specificity in both solution-gate ( SG) and dual-gate ( DG) modes. Compared with previously reported results , the NR-ISFET biosensor enables selective prostate specific antigen ( PSA) detection based on antibody-antigen binding in broader detection range with lower LOD. For the first time , real-time specific detection of PSA of 10 pM to 1 Î¼M in 100 mM phosphate buffer ( PB) was demonstrated by conductance measurements using the polyethylene glycol ( PEG)- modified NR-ISFET biosensors in DG mode with the back-gate bias ( V
