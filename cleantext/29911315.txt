  The fusion of heteroaromatic rings into ladder-type heteroarenes can stabilize frontier molecular orbitals and lead to improved physicochemical properties , which are beneficial for applications in various optoelectronic devices. Hence , ladder-type heteroarenes , which feature highly planar backbones and well delocalized Ï€-conjugation , recently have emerged as a type of promising organic semiconductors with excellent device performance in organic photovoltaics and organic field-effect transistors. In this Focus Review , we summarize the recent advances in ladder-type heteroarenes based organic semiconductors including hole-transporting and electron-transporting molecular semiconductors as well as fully ladder-type conjugated polymers towards their applications in organic photovoltaics and field-effect transistor. The use of ladder-type small molecular acceptor materials has strikingly boosted the power conversion efficiency of fullerene-free solar cells , recently , and the selected cases of latest developed ladder-type fused ring electron acceptor ( FREA) materials are also elaborated.
