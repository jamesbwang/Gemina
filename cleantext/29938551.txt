  Purpose of the article. To explore the strength of association between different maternal and pregnancy characteristics and the occurrence of abnormally invasive placenta ( AIP). Pubmed , Embase , CINAHL databases were searched. The risk factors for AIP explored were: obesity , age > 35 years , smoking before or during pregnancy , placenta previa , prior cesarean section ( CS) , placenta previa and prior CS , prior uterine surgery , abortion<disease> and uterine curettage , in vitro fertilization ( IVF) pregnancy and interval between a previous CS , and a subsequent pregnancy. Random-effect head-to-head meta-analyses were used to analyze the data. Forty-six were included in the systematic review. Maternal obesity ( Odd ratio , OR: 1.4 , 95 % CI 1.0-1.8) , advanced maternal age ( OR: 3.1 , 95 % CI 1.4-7.0) and parity ( OR: 2.5 , 95 % CI 1.7-3.6) , but not smoking were associated with a higher risk of AIP. The presence of placenta previa in women with at least a prior CS was associated with a higher risk of AIP compared to controls , with an OR of 12.0 , 95 % CI 1.6-88.0. Furthermore , the risk of AIP increased with the number of prior CS ( OR of 2.6 , 95 % CI 1.6-4.4 and 5.4 , 95 % CI 1.7-17.4 for two and three prior CS respectively). Finally , IVF pregnancies were associated with a high risk of AIP , with an OR of 2.8 ( 95 % CI 1.2-6.8). A prior CS and placenta previa are among the strongest risk factors for the occurrence of AIP.
