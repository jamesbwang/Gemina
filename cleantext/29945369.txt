  Steaming method is a traditional processing method for Gastrodiae Rhizoma ( GR). The current studies on the steaming method 's mechanism of GR are mainly focused on facilitating softening slice , destroying the Î²-glycosidic bond enzymes to reduce the decomposition of gastrodia glycosides ( killing enzyme and protecting glycosides). The researches on the processing mechanism are still incomplete , while revealing and analyzing the active components in the body 's metabolic process are important channels and new models to clarify the mechanism of traditional medicine processing. In order to provides a reference for the in-depth study of the processing mechanism of GR , we have reviewed the relevant literature at home and abroad in recent years and briefly summarized the processing , composition analysis and in vivo metabolism of GR in this study.
