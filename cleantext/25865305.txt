  The European association for the study of the liver and chronic liver failure consortium ( EASL-CLIF) recently proposed diagnostic criteria for acute on chronic liver failure ( ACLF). There is lack of data regarding liver transplant outcomes in ACLF patients based on these criteria. The objective of this study was to determine outcome following living donor liver transplantation ( LDLT) in ACLF patients. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent LDLT for ACLF based on European association for the study of the liver and chronic liver failure consortium ( EASL-CLIF) diagnostic criteria ( group 1) ( Median MELD scores for group 1 and 2 patients in ACLF grade 1 was 28 ( 20-38) and 31 ( 24-36) , in ACLF grade 2 was 35 ( 24-42) and 36 ( 24-42) and in ACLF grade 3 was 36 ( 29-42) and 38 ( 32-52). For group 1 and 2 , 30 day mortality in ACLF grade 1 , 2 and 3 was 2/43 ( 4.6 %) versus 9/15 ( 60 %) ( LDLT has excellent outcomes in patients with EASL-CLIF grade 1 and 2 ACLF. Without transplantation , ACLF patients have a very poor prognosis.
