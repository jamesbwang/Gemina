  Simulation models in many scientific fields can have non-unique solutions or unique solutions which can be difficult to find. Moreover , in evolving systems , unique final state solutions can be reached by multiple different trajectories. Neuroscience is no exception. Often , neural network models are subject to parameter fitting to obtain desirable output comparable to experimental data. Parameter fitting without sufficient constraints and a systematic exploration of the possible solution space can lead to conclusions valid only around local minima or around non-minima. To address this issue , we have developed an interactive tool for visualizing and steering parameters in neural network simulation models. In this work , we focus particularly on connectivity generation , since finding suitable connectivity configurations for neural network models constitutes a complex parameter search scenario. The development of the tool has been guided by several use cases-the tool allows researchers to steer the parameters of the connectivity generation during the simulation , thus quickly growing networks composed of multiple populations with a targeted mean activity. The flexibility of the software allows scientists to explore other connectivity and neuron variables apart from the ones presented as use cases. With this tool , we enable an interactive exploration of parameter spaces and a better understanding of neural network models and grapple with the crucial problem of non-unique network solutions and trajectories. In addition , we observe a reduction in turn around times for the assessment of these models , due to interactive visualization while the simulation is computed.
