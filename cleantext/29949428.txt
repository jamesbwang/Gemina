  The present study sought to identify predictors associated with paid employment outcomes for community and technical college students with intellectual disability ( ID). Data used were collected from the Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students With Intellectual Disabilities ( TPSID) implemented in two community and technical colleges in the upper Midwest. The participants included 228 students with ID attending college who received supports based on the Check & Connect model. Results using logistic regression showed that students who only took inclusive classes , participated in campus events , had prior paid work experience , and participated in volunteering and/or community service were more likely to earn at or above minimum wage during their most recent year in the TPSID program. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.
