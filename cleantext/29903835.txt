  Fathers contribute to their children 's health starting at the beginning of life. Few parent education programs include fathers. Among those that do , there is little effort to report program effects on father outcomes. In this systematic review , we examined father-inclusive perinatal parent education programs in the United States as they relate to a range of father outcomes. The databases searched were PubMed , Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature , Embase , Ovid Medline , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and PsycINFO. Studies were included if they included an evaluation of a parent education program and a report of father outcomes measured within 1 year of the child 's birth and were conducted within the United States. Of 1353 total articles , 21 met study criteria. The overall state of the father-inclusive perinatal parent education program literature was poor , with few interventions available to fathers. Available programs were associated with increased father involvement , coparenting relationship , partner relationship quality , father 's mental health , and father 's supportive behaviors. Program effects on father-infant interaction , parenting knowledge , and attitudes and parenting self-efficacy were inconclusive. Three programs emerged as best evidence-based interventions. Risk of bias was high for many studies. Outcome variability , small sample size , and publication bias contributed to the weak evidence base. There is a need for more evidence-based interventions to support fathers. Clinicians play a key role in engaging fathers in early parent education programs and health care settings.
