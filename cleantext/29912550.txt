  Ferroelectric perovskites hold promise of enhanced photovoltaic efficiency and photocatalytic activity. Consequently , the photoresponse of oxide ferroelectric thin films is an active field of research. In electrode/ferroelectric/electrode devices , internal charge in the ferroelectric , free charge in the electrodes , and buried adsorbates at interfaces combine to screen the ferroelectric polarization and to stabilize the polar state. Under illumination , photoinduced carriers and photodissociated adsorbates may disrupt the screening equilibrium , modifying the switchable polarization and altering its expected benefits. Here , we explore the photoresponse of BaTiO
