  Cardiovascular system is adapted to gravity , and reactions to its vanishing in space are presumably dependent on body size. Dependency of hematological parameters and body fluids reaction to simulated microgravity have never been studied as an allometric function before. Thus we estimated RBC , blood and extracellular fluid volumes in hindlimb-unloaded ( HLU) or control ( ATT) mice , rats and rabbits.RBC decrease was found to be size-independent , and the allometric dependency for red blood<symptom> loss<symptom> in HLU and ATT animals shared a common power ( -0.054 Â± 0.008) but differrent Y
