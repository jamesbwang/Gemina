  Detecting cfDNA in plasma or serum could serve as a ` liquid biopsy ' , for circulating tumor DNA with aberrant methylation patterns offer a possible method for early detection of several cancers which could avoid the need for tumor tissue biopsies. Bone Morphogenetic Protein 3 ( BMP3) was identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene putatively down-regulated in colorectal cancer ( CRC). In this study , we aimed to assess the potential role of BMP3 promoter methylation changes in plasma DNA for detection of colorectal cancerous and precancerous lesions<symptom>. Plasma DNA samples were extracted from 50 patients with histologically diagnosed polyps or tumor and 50 patients reported negative for polyps or tumors. The procedure consists of bisulfite conversion of the extracted DNA , purification of bis-DNA , and BMP3 methylation status analysis by using the bisulfite specific high resolution melting analysis. This study demonstrated that there was a significantly higher frequency of BMP3 methylated DNA in plasma in patients with polyps versus healthy controls with a sensitivity and specificity of 40 and 94 % , respectively. In conclusion , our results demonstrated that BMP3 DNA methylation in plasma had not have sufficient sensitivity and it should be used in combination with other biomarkers for the detection of CRC.
