  Vitamin A deficiency is still a public health concern affecting millions of pregnant women and children. Retinoic acid , the active form of vitamin A , is critical for proper mammalian embryonic development. Embryos can generate retinoic acid from maternal circulating β-carotene upon oxidation of retinaldehyde produced via the symmetric cleavage enzyme β-carotene 15,15 '- oxygenase ( BCO1). Another cleavage enzyme , β-carotene 9 ' ,10 '- oxygenase ( BCO2) , asymmetrically cleaves β-carotene in adult tissues to prevent its mitochondrial toxicity , generating β-apo-10 '- carotenal , which can be converted to retinoids ( vitamin A and its metabolites) by BCO1. However , the role of BCO2 during mammalian embryogenesis is unknown. We found that mice lacking BCO2 on a vitamin A deficiency-susceptible genetic background ( Rbp4
