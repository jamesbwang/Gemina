  Recurrent urolithiasis is a common and potentially morbid complication of spina bifida. Although the size , the location , and the composition of these stones often necessitates percutaneous intervention , access is often complicated by body habitus and spinal deformity. There is little consensus regarding the approach to percutaneous lithotripsy when a clear path to the collecting system is unavailable , particularly in the setting of surgically augmented urological anatomy. Here we present the first known case in which a pediatric patient with spina bifida underwent percutaneous lithotripsy of bladder stones via a transpsoas approach.
