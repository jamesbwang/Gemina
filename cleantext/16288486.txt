  Radiation-associated angiosarcoma ( RAAS) is a type of radiation-associated sarcoma<disease> ( RAS) that develops at the previous field of radiation in breast cancer patients. Although several reports have suggested a poor prognosis for RAAS , the 5-year overall survival of RAAS is better than that of cutaneous angiosarcoma ( CAS) , suggesting that the prognostic factors of RAAS and CAS might be different , at least in part. In this report , we describe a case of RAAS , and employed immunohistochemical ( IHC) staining of PD-L1 and MMP9 as well as periostin , IL-4 , and CD163. Interestingly , IHC staining revealed that the RAAS in our case was positive for PD-L1 and negative for MMP9. Moreover , the predominant stromal factor of our case was periostin , suggesting that TAMs in the present case was not immunosuppressive , but an inflammatory subtype. These results might explain , at least in part , the better prognosis of RAAS compared to CAS.
