  We present nonrotating simulations with the Goddard Earth Observing System ( GEOS) atmospheric general circulation model ( AGCM) in a square limited area domain over uniform sea surface temperature. As in previous studies , convection spontaneously aggregates into humid clusters , driven by a combination of radiative and moisture-convective feedbacks. The aggregation is qualitatively independent of resolution , with horizontal grid spacing from 3 to 110 km , with both explicit and parameterized deep convection. A budget for the spatial variance of column moist static energy suggests that longwave radiative and surface flux feedbacks help establish aggregation , while the shortwave feedback contributes to its maintenance. Mechanism-denial experiments confirm that aggregation does not occur without interactive longwave radiation. Ice cloud radiative effects help support the humid convecting regions but are not essential for aggregation , while liquid clouds have a negligible effect. Removing the dependence of parameterized convection on tropospheric humidity reduces the intensity of aggregation but does not prevent the formation of dry regions.
