  To summarize the effects of the bone<disease> marrow niche on hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis and discuss the chemotherapy resistance that can arise from interactions between the niche and leukemia<disease> stem cells. We review the major roles of the bone<disease> marrow niche in cell proliferation , adhesion and drug resistance. The signaling pathways and major molecular participants in the niche are discussed. We also address potential niche-targeting strategies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). The bone<disease> marrow niche supports normal hematopoiesis and affects acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) initiation , progression and chemotherapy resistance. AML is a group of heterogeneous malignant diseases characterized by the excessive proliferation of hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells. Even with intensive chemotherapy regimens and stem cell transplantation , the overall survival rate for AML is poor. The bone<disease> marrow niches of malignant cells are remodeled into a leukemia-permissive environment , and these reformed niches protect AML cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death. Inhibiting the cellular and molecular interactions between the niche and leukemia<disease> cells is a promising direction for targeted therapies for AML treatment. Interactions between leukemia<disease> cells and the bone<disease> marrow niche influence hematopoiesis , leukemogenesis , and chemotherapy resistance in AML and require ongoing study. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie these interactions will help identify rational niche-targeting therapies to improve treatment outcomes in AML patients.
