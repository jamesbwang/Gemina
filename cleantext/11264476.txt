  Spinal cord injury ( SCI) is a complex clinical and progressive condition characterized by neuronal loss , axonal destruction and demyelination. In the last few years , adenosine receptors have been studied as a target for many diseases , including neurodegenerative conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an adenosine receptor agonist , PDRN , in an experimental model of SCI. Moreover , since adenosine receptors stimulation may also activate the Wnt pathway , we wanted to study PDRN effects on Wnt signaling following SCI. Spinal trauma was induced by extradural compression of spinal cord at T5-T8 level in C57BL6/J mice. Animals were randomly assigned to the following groups: Sham (
