  USH2A encodes for usherin , a basement membrane protein in the inner ear and retina. USH2A can cause retinitis pigmentosa ( RP) with or without hearing loss. The aim of this study was to detect USH2A mutations in a Chinese cohort of 75 small RP families and 10 Usher syndrome<disease> families. We performed a direct Sanger sequencing analysis of the USH2A gene to identify mutations for this cohort. We identified a total of eight mutations in four of the 75 small RP families ( 5.3 %) and two mutations in one of the 10 Usher families ( 10 %); all families were detected to have compound heterozygous mutations. In families with nonsyndromic RP , we identified the compound heterozygous mutations p.Pro4818Leuand p.Leu2395Hisfs * 19 in family No. 19114 , p.Arg4493His and p.His1677Glnfs * 15 in family No. 19162 , c.8559-2A > G and p.Arg1549 * in family No. 19123 and p.Ser5060Pro and p.Arg34Leufs * 41 in family No. 19178. We also identified the heterozygous mutations p.Arg3719His and p.Cys934Trp in family No. 19124 , which was the Usher syndrome<disease> family. These mutations were predicted to be harmful by SIFT , PROVEAN , Mutation Taster or PolyPhen-2. Our results revealed six novel mutations in the USH2A gene in a Chinese population , which is beneficial for the clinical use of genetic testing of USH2A in patients with autosomal-recessive or sporadic RP and Usher
