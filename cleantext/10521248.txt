  Inflammation<symptom> , oxidative stress , and the formation of advanced glycated end-products ( AGEs) are important components of atherosclerosis. Vascular adhesion protein-1 ( VAP-1) participates in inflammation<symptom>. Its enzymatic activity , semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase ( SSAO) , can catalyze oxidative deamination reactions to produce hydrogen peroxide and aldehydes , leading to the subsequent generation of AGEs. This study aimed to investigate the effect of VAP-1/ SSAO inhibition on atherosclerosis. In our study , immunohistochemical staining showed that atherosclerotic plaques displayed higher VAP-1 expression than normal arterial walls in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice , cholesterol-fed New Zealand White rabbits and humans. In cholesterol-fed rabbits , VAP-1 was expressed on endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in the thickened intima of the aorta. Treatment with PXS-4728A , a selective VAP-1/ SSAO inhibitor , in cholesterol-fed rabbits significantly decreased SSAO-specific hydrogen peroxide generation in the aorta and reduced atherosclerotic plaques. VAP-1/ SSAO inhibition also lowered blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , reduced the expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines , suppressed recruitment and activation of macrophages , and decreased migration and proliferation of SMC. In conclusion , VAP-1/ SSAO inhibition reduces atherosclerosis and may act through suppression of several important mechanisms for atherosclerosis.
