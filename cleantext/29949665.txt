  Xanthomonas<pathogen> oryzae<pathogen> pv. oryzae<pathogen> is the causative agent of rice bacterial leaf blight. While the type III secretion system of X. oryzae<pathogen> pv. oryzae<pathogen> is essential for virulence , the biochemical activities and virulence mechanisms of non-transcription activator-like ( non-TAL) effectors delivered by this system are largely unknown. Here , by screening for non-TAL effectors that contribute to X. oryzae<pathogen> pv. oryzae<pathogen> virulence , we revealed that Xanthomonas<pathogen> outer protein K ( XopK) inhibits pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Specifically , XopK interacted with and directly ubiquitinated rice somatic embryogenic receptor kinase 2 ( OsSERK2) , resulting in its degradation. Accordingly , mutation of a putative ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme ( E2) binding site abolished XopK-induced degradation of OsSERK2 and compromised XopK-dependent virulence. As crucial immune regulators associated with a multitude of immune receptors , SERKs have been shown to be perturbed by Pseudomonas effectors via different mechanisms. Our study revealed a distinct perturbation mechanism of SERK activity via ubiquitination achieved by Xanthomonas<pathogen> non-TAL effector.
