  Metal-catalyzed reductive coupling has emerged as an alternative to the use of stoichiometric organometallic reagents in an increasingly diverse range of carbonyl and imine additions. In this review , the use of diene , allene , and enyne pronucleophiles in intermolecular carbonyl and imine reductive couplings are surveyed , along with related hydrogen autotransfer processes.
