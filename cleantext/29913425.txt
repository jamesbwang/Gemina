  RFamide-related peptide-3 ( RFRP-3) and its receptor ( GPR147) play an important role in reproduction regulation in mammals. To understand the role of RFRP-3 in male reproductive function of epididymis , we first investigated the expression changes in RFRP-3 and its receptor at different stages of development , that is , postnatal day 20 ( P20) , 40 ( P40) , 60 ( P60) and 80 ( P80). Our results showed that fluctuations in the expression of GnIH and GPR147 during postnatal development occurred , and the highest epididymal GnIH and GPR147 expression were both detected in P60. Subsequently , we further investigated the effect of RFRP-3 on the histology , apoptosis and autophagy of the epididymis in vivo. For in vivo study , male rats were treated intratesticularly with different doses of RFRP-3 ( control , 0.1 μg , 1 μg , and 10 μg per day) for 7 days. Our results show that RFRP-3 caused dose-dependent histological changes in the epididymal duct , such as a decline in the number of spermatozoa and an increase in degenerated and vacuolated epididymal epithelial cells. Rats treated intratesticularly with RFRP-3 also showed dose-dependent effects on caspase-3 activation and the expression of apoptotic markers ( whole caspase-3 , cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2). However , the expression of autophagy markers ( Beclin-1 and Atg5) exhibited a bidirectional , dose-dependent effect. It is concluded that RFRP-3 plays a regulatory role in male rat reproduction , possibly because RFRP-3 mediates the apoptosis and autophagy of the epididymis.
