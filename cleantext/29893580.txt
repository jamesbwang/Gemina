  Post-ERCP pancreatitis<disease> ( PEP) is a common complication most feared by endoscopists. Incidence ranges widelly from 2.1 % to 24.4 % , which results from patient heterogeneity and differences in endoscopist expertise , method , PEP definition , and severity. Pathophysiology is multifactorial , and involves a combination of chemical , thermal , mechanical , hydrostatic , enzymatic , allergic , and microbiological factors resulting from papillary instrumentation and/or contrast administration within the pancreatic duct ( volume and osmolarity). Even genetic abnormalities may represent a risk factor , as is the case with homozygous alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency , which leads to an increase in hemorrhagic PEP rates.
