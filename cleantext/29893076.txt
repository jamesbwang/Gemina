  We aimed to obtain the recombinant aminopeptidase encoded by Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> ( L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen>) gene lmo1711 , and characterized the enzyme. First , the amino acid sequences of Lmo1711 from L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> EGD-e<pathogen> and its homologues in other microbial species were aligned and the putative active sites were analyzed. The putative model of Lmo1711 was constructed through the SWISS-MODEL Workspace. Then , the plasmid pET30a-Lmo1711 was constructed and transformed into E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> for expression of the recombinant Lmo1711. The his-tagged soluble protein was purified using the nickel-chelated affinity column chromatography. With the amino acid-p-nitroaniline as the substrate , Lmo1711 hydrolyzed the substrate to free p-nitroaniline monomers , whose absorbance measured at 405 nm reflected the aminopeptidase activity. The specificity of Lmo1711 to substrates was then examined by changing various substrates , and the effect of metal ions on the catalytic efficiency of this enzyme was further determined. Based on the bioinformatics data , Lmo1711 is a member of the M29 family aminopeptidases , containing a highly conserved catalytic motif ( Glu-Glu-His-Tyr-His-Asp) with typical structure arrangements of the peptidase family. The recombinant Lmo1711 with a size of about 49.3 kDa exhibited aminopeptidase activity and had a selectivity to the substrates , with the highest degree of affinity for leucine-p-nitroaniline. Interestingly , the enzymatic activity of Lmo1711 can be activated by Cd ² ⁺ , Zn ² ⁺ , and is strongly stimulated by Co ² ⁺. We here , for the first time demonstrate that L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> lmo1711 encodes a cobalt-activated aminopeptidase of M29 family.
