  Although total disc arthroplasty ( TDA) is a common procedure for selected cases of degenerative disc disease , until today there are only two cases of TDA infections reported in the literature. We report three cases of postoperative TDA infections , two developed cutaneous fistulas<disease>. To eradicate the infectious site , a staged removal of the device , resolute debridement , and stabilization plus fusion is proposed. Surgeons are challenged by ( 1) major retroperitoneal vessels adherent to the device , ( 2) surrounding scar tissue , ( 3) accompanying retroperitoneal abscess<disease> , and ( 4) technical issues when removing and replacing the implant. A staged multidisciplinary team approach involving vascular and plastic surgery as well as spine specialists is mandatory to achieve good results.
