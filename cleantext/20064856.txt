  A distinguishing aspect of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA) is its androgen-dependence , possibly explaining why only males are clinically affected. This disease , which impairs neuromuscular function , is linked to a polyglutamine expansion mutation in the androgen receptor ( AR). In mouse models of SBMA , motor<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> is associated with pronounced defects in neuromuscular transmission , including defects in evoked transmitter release ( quantal content , QC) and fiber membrane excitability ( based on the resting membrane potential , RMP). However , whether such defects are androgen-dependent is unknown. Thus , we recorded synaptic potentials intracellularly from adult muscle fibers of transgenic ( Tg) AR97Q male mice castrated pre-symptomatically. Although castration largely protects both QC and the RMP of fibers , correlating with the protective effect of castration on motor function , significant deficits in QC and RMP remained. Surprisingly , comparable defects in QC and RMP were also observed in pre-symptomatic AR97Q males , indicating that such defects emerge early and are pre-clinical. Exposing asymptomatic Tg females to androgens also induces both motor<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> and comparable defects in QC and RMP. Notably , asymptomatic Tg females also showed significant deficits in QC and RMP , albeit less severe , supporting their pre-clinical nature , but also raising questions about the androgen-dependence of pre-clinical symptoms. In summary , current evidence indicates that disease progression depends on androgens , but early pathogenic events may be triggered by the mutant AR allele independent of androgens. Such early , androgen-independent disease mechanisms may also be relevant to females carrying the SBMA allele.
