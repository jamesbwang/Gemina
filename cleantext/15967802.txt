  MicroRNAs are endogenous , small non-coding RNAs that can play critical gene-regulatory roles during skeletal muscle development and are highly conserved. miR-487b-3p is expressed in muscle , and the detailed mechanism by which it regulates myoblast proliferation and differentiation has not been explored. Here , we found that miR-487b-3p expression was significantly higher in goat muscle tissues than in other tissues and was higher in fetal goat muscle tissues than in mature goat tissues , suggesting that miR-487b-3p has an important effect on skeletal muscle myogenesis. Functional studies showed that miR-487b-3p overexpression significantly suppressed C2C12 myoblast proliferation and differentiation , which was accompanied by the down-regulation of functional genes related to proliferation ( MyoD , Pax7 and PCNA) and differentiation ( Myf5 , MyoG and Mef2c) , whereas the inhibition of miR-487b-3p accelerated C2C12 myoblast proliferation and differentiation and was accompanied by the up-regulation of functional genes. Using Target-Scan and David , we found that miR-487b-3p targeted the 3 '- UTR of IRS1 , an essential regulator in the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways. We then confirmed the targeting of IRS1 by miR-487b-3p using dual-luciferase assays , RT-qPCR and western blotting. Furthermore , IRS1 silencing markedly inhibited proliferation and differentiation in cultured C2C12 myoblasts , confirming the important role of IRS1 in myogenesis. These results reveal an IRS1-mediated regulatory link between miR-487b-3p and the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways during skeletal muscle myogenesis.
