  Surgery remains the gold standard both for delimited hepatocellular carcinoma by selective anatomic liver segentectomy and for colorectal liver metastases by parenchymal sparing liver resection. Right anterior sector ( RAS) ( segments V-VIII; Couinaud) is the largest and most difficult sector to operate on. A better knowledge of its segmentation could prevent postoperative remnant liver ischemia and its impacts on patient 's survival. A literature search was conducted in PubMed for papers on anatomy and surgery of the right anterior sector. Segmentation of the RAS depended of the anatomic variations of the third-order portal branches. Cranio-caudal segmentation was the most commonly found ( 50-53 %) , followed by ventro-dorsal ( 23-26 %) , trifurcation ( 13-20 %) , and quadrifurcation types ( 5-11 %). Ventral and dorsal partial or total subsegmentectomy seemed accessible in 47 to 50 % of patients , including bifurcation , trifurcation , and quadrifurcation types , and could spare up to 22 % of the total liver volume. The RAS hepatic vein was present in 85-100 % of the patients and could be used as a landmark between RAS dorsal and ventral part in 63 % of patients. Reported overall morbidity rate of RAS subsegmentectomy ranged from 33 to 59 % among studies with a postoperative major complication rate ( Clavien-Dindo â‰¥ III) ranging around 18 % and a biliary leakage rate from 16 to 21 %. In-hospital reported mortality rate was low ( 0-3 %) , and results were comparable to `` classic '' liver resections. RAS subsegmentectomy remains a complex procedure; median operating time ranged from 253 to 520 min and median intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> reached 1255 ml. Better knowledge of RAS anatomy could allow for parenchymal preservation by using subsegmentectomy of the RAS , selective or as a part of a major hepatectomy.
