  Mesoblastic nephroma is the most frequent renal tumor in newborns and young infants , and the cellular type is characterized by an ETV6-NTRK fusion , which constitutively activates the tropomyosin-related kinase ( TRK) signaling pathway. Larotrectinib is a highly selective TRK inhibitor with activity in adult and pediatric patients who have TRK fusions. We present a rare case of a patient with mesoblastic nephroma metastatic to bone who had a dramatic response to larotrectinib.
