  Tendon tears are common injuries that heal with scar formation. Interestingly , MRL/MpJ mice heal without scar in several tissues , including tendon. Most hypotheses regarding scarless healing implicate the systemic environment. However , the tissue-specificity of this regenerative response and our previous findings showing regeneration of sub-rupture tendon injuries , which lack an overt systemic response , motivate a tissue-driven hypothesis. Our objective is to investigate the potential of the local tendon environment in driving scarless healing ( 1) by comparing the systemic response and the healing capacity associated with ear and tendon injuries in MRL/MpJ mice , and ( 2) by comparing intrinsic healing properties between MRL/MpJ and normal healer C57Bl/6 tendons. We examined the systemic inflammatory and local structural environments of ear and tendon punch injuries in MRL/MpJ and C57Bl/6 mice. Systemic differences were analyzed to assess effects of different injuries on the inflammatory response. Correlations were assessed between MRL/MpJ ear and tendon injuries to compare the extent of healing between regenerative tissues. Analysis showed similarities between the systemic environment in MRL/MpJ post ear or tendon injuries. However , comparable inflammatory responses did not translate into analogous healing between tissues , suggesting that the systemic environment is not the driver of regeneration. Supporting the regenerative role of the local environment , healing MRL/MpJ tendons exhibited improved matrix and cell alignment and a distinct composition of growth factors and Hyaluronan from C57Bl/6. These findings support the tissue-driven hypothesis for MRL/MpJ tendon regeneration and motivate further investigation regarding specific roles of extracellular factors in scarless healing.
