  Phosphatidylinositol ( PI) kinases ( PIKs) regulate cell proliferation , survival , membrane trafficking , and other processes. PIK classes are distinguished by substrate preference and their distinct phosphorylated PI products. Recently two Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> PIKs ( PfPIKs) have been recognized as attractive new drug targets. Here we briefly summarize PIK biochemistry and recent progress with PfPIKs.
