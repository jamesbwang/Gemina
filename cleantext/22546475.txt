  Fluoro-Jade is a fluorescein-derived fluorochrome which specifically binds to damaged neurons. Due to this characteristic , it is commonly used for the histochemical detection and quantification of neurodegeneration in mounted brain sections. Here , we describe an alternative and simpler histochemistry protocol based on the use of free-floating brain sections. For this purpose , we have used brain slices from wild-type and 5xFAD mice as well as from mice that received an intracerebral injection of oligomeric amyloid beta peptides. We observed that our histochemistry staining procedure allows for a well-defined labeling of degenerating neurons providing a better signal-to-noise ratio staining than the commonly used one. In addition , our modified protocol demonstrates the ability of Fluoro-Jade C to also fluorescently label amyloid beta plaques.
