  The biogeographic patterns of abundance and prevalence of helminths from Liza haematocheilus were studied across its native ( Sea of Japan) and introduced ( Sea of Azov) distribution ranges. Abundance-occupancy relationships ( AORs) were tested for the core-satellite and enemy release ( ERH) species hypotheses in eight and 14 host samples from the native and introduced host ranges , respectively. The AOR model fitted parasite data extremely well , irrespective of whether the host or the parasite species were native or invasive. Except for co-introduced monogeneans , species were less abundant and prevalent in the introduced host population than in the native one , which agrees well with the ERH. Two occupancy patterns were observed. A unimodal , right-skewed distribution of prevalence frequency was common for the acquired groups of helminth parasites in the introduced range , whereas a bimodal distribution was more common in the native range. Core species in the native range were monogeneans , adult and larval digeneans , whereas host-specific , co-introduced monogeneans were the only core species in the introduced range. Acquired grey-mullet specialists and host generalists infected only a small portion of the introduced host population with low mean abundance. These results indicate that strict host specificity , together with a direct life cycle , are the traits that enabled helminth species to entirely occupy the invasive host population. The AORs showed that parasite individuals tend to accumulate in a relatively small fraction of susceptible introduced hosts , probably as an adaptation to enhance mating opportunities , thereby providing a mechanistic explanation of the ERH. All this evidence suggests that co-introduced and acquired species use the introduced host population in very different ways. Therefore , we posit that the examination of AORs can be instrumental in understanding the role of co-introduced parasites in invasion theory.
