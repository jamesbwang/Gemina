  Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> is widely used for the large-scale industrial production of proteins. In this study , the transcriptomes of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> 168 and B.<pathogen> megaterium<pathogen> DSM319 cells grown in stationary phase were analyzed to expand the repertoire of highly-active promoters for high-level protein expression based on the transcriptomes of these Bacillus<pathogen> strains. 24 genes with the highest expression levels among 2048 highly expressed gene families were chosen to examine promoter activity. The activities of four promoters with the beta-galactosidase ( bgaB) gene as a reporter were stronger than those of the well-characterized strong promoter P43. The expression level of recombinant Pro-transglutaminase ( pro-MTG) from Streptomyces mobaraensis achieved 87.6 U/mL and 70.7 U/mL under the control of two constitutive promoter P
