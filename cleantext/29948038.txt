  Congenital absence of the long head of the biceps ( LHB) tendon is a rare variation in shoulder anatomy. The authors present a case of congenital absence of the long head of the biceps tendon associated with a large insertion of the subscapularis muscle. The patient initially presented with shoulder pain on overhead activity. Shoulder examination was negative for signs of a torn biceps tendon. MRI revealed congenital absence of the LHB tendon , a rim rent tear of the supraspinatus , and a large insertion of the subscapularis muscle. This is the first reported case describing a large insertion of the subscapularis muscle associated with absence of the LHB tendon .5.
