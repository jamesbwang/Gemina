  Outer membrane complex ( OMC) vaccines , which contain antigens from the bacterial outer membrane , have been developed for multiple Gram-negative bacteria. However , OMC vaccines demonstrate high endotoxin activity due to the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the bacterial outer membrane , thus precluding their use in humans. We isolated OMCs from an LPS-deficient strain of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> ( IB010) which completely lacks LPS due to a mutation in the lpxD gene. OMCs from IB010 demonstrated a more than 10,000-fold reduction in endotoxin activity compared to OMCs from wild type A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen>. Vaccination with IB010 OMCs produced similar levels of antigen-specific IgG and IgM after two administrations compared to wild type OMCs , and resulted in a similar reduction in post-infection spleen bacterial loads and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Vaccination with IB010 OMCs provided significant protection against infection compared to control mice , indicating the LPS-free OMCs could contribute to vaccine strategies for preventing infection by
