  This study constructed a biological-inorganic hybrid system including Pseudomonas<pathogen> putida<pathogen> ( P.<pathogen> putida<pathogen>) and bioreduced Pd ( 0) nanoparticles ( NPs) , and inspected the influence of bio-nano Pd ( 0) on the direct electron transfer and phenol biodegradation. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( SEM-EDX) showed that bio-nano Pd ( 0) ( ~ 10 nm) were evenly dispersed on the surface and in the periplasm of P.<pathogen> putida<pathogen>. With the incorporation of bio-nano Pd ( 0) , the redox currents of bacteria in the cyclic voltammetry ( CV) became higher and the oxidation current increased as the addition of lactate , while the highest increase rates of two electron transfer system ( ETS) rates were 63.97 % and 33.79 % , respectively. These results indicated that bio-nano Pd ( 0) could directly promote the electron transfer of P.<pathogen> putida<pathogen>. In phenol biodegradation process , P. putida-Pd ( 0)- 2 showed the highest k ( 0.2992 h
