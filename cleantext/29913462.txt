  Developing a workforce skilled in improving the safety of medical care has often been cited as an important means to achieve safer care. Although some educational programs geared toward patient safety have been developed , few advanced training programs have been described in the literature. We describe the development of a patient safety fellowship program. We describe the development and curriculum of an Interprofessional Fellowship in Patient Safety. The 1-year in residence fellowship focuses on domains such as leadership , spreading innovations , medical improvement , patient safety culture , reliability science , and understanding errors. Specific training in patient safety is available and has been delivered to 48 fellows from a wide range of backgrounds. Fellows have accomplished much in terms of improvement projects , educational innovations , and publications. After completing the fellowship program , fellows are obtaining positions within health-care quality and safety and are likely to make long-term contributions. We offer a curriculum and fellowship design for the topic of patient safety. Available evidence suggests that the fellowship results in the development of patient safety professionals.
