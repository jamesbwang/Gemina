  Neuroimaging has opened new opportunities to study the neural correlates of consciousness<symptom> , and provided additional information concerning diagnosis , prognosis , and therapeutic interventions in patients with disorders of consciousness<symptom>. Here , we aim to review neuroimaging studies in chronic disorders of consciousness<symptom> from the viewpoint of the brain network , focusing on positron emission tomography , functional MRI , functional near-infrared spectroscopy , electrophysiology , and diffusion MRI. To accelerate basic research on disorders of consciousness<symptom> and provide a panoramic view of unconsciousness , we propose that it is urgent to integrate different techniques at various spatiotemporal scales , and to merge fragmented findings into a uniform `` Brainnetome '' ( Brain-net-ome) research framework.
