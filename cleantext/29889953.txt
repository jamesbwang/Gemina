  The performance of a new tourniquet model was compared with that of an established model in simulated first aid. Four users applied the Combat Application Tourniquet ( C-A-T) , an established model that served as the control tourniquet , and the new SAM Extremity Tourniquet ( SXT) model , which was the study tourniquet. The performance of the C-A-T was better than that of the SXT for seven measured parameters versus two , respectively; metrics were statistically tied 12 times. The degree of difference , when present , was often small. For pretime , a period of uncontrolled bleeding from the start to a time point when the tourniquet first contacts the manikin , the bleeding rate was uncontrolled at approximately 10.4 mL/s , and for an overall average of 39 seconds of pretime , 406mL of blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was calculated. The mean time to determination of bleeding control ( ± standard deviation ( SD)) was 66 seconds ( SXT , 70 ± 30 seconds; C-A-T , 62 ± 18 seconds; p = .0075). The mean ease-of-use score was 4 ( indicating easy) on a scale of 1 to 5 , with 5 indicating very easy ( mean ± SD: SXT , 4 ± 1; C-A-T , 5 ± 0; p < .0001). C-A-T also performed better for total trial time , manikin damage , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> rate , pressure , and composite score. SXT was better for pretime and unwrap time. All users intuitively self-selected the speed at which they applied the tourniquets and that speed was similar in all of the required steps. However , by time segments , one user went slowest in each segment while the other three generally went faster. In simulated first aid with tourniquets , better results generally were seen with the C-A-T than with the SXT in terms of performance metrics. However , the degree of difference , when present , was often small.
