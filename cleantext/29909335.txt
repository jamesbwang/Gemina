  The rapid growth of cruise ship tourism increases the use of historic port cities as strategic hubs for cruise ship operators. Benefits derived from increased tourism for the municipality and cruise ships are often at odds with the environmental and social impacts associated with continued historical port use. This study illustrates the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis ( MCDA) for weighing of various criteria and metrics related to the environment , economy , and social sustainability for the selection of a sustainable cruise line route. Specifically , MCDA methodology was employed in Venice , Italy to illustrate its application. First , the four most representative navigational route projects among those presented to local authorities were assessed based on social , economic , and environmental considerations. Second , a pool of experts representing the local authority , private port businesses , and cruise line industry were consulted to evaluate the validity and weight assignments for the selected criteria. Finally , a sensitivity analysis was employed to assess the robustness of the recommendations using an evaluation of weight changes and their effects on the ranking of alternative navigational routes. The results were presented and discussed in a multi-stakeholder meeting to further the route selection process.
