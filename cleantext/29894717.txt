  The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of invitation to cervical cancer screening through a very low-cost strategy based on automated and customized text messages , phone calls and reminders. A randomized ( 1:1) controlled trial was conducted among 13 Portuguese primary care units , recruiting women aged 25 to 49 years , eligible for cervical cancer screening , with an available mobile phone number. In the intervention group , participants were invited for cervical cancer screening through automated/customized text messages and phone calls , followed by text message reminders. Participants in the control group were invited through a written letter ( standard of care). The primary outcome was the proportion of women adherent to screening up to 45 days after invitation and the secondary outcome was defined as the adherence proportion after invitation based only on text messages and reminders. A total of 1220 women were randomized , 605 to intervention and 615 to control group. The adherence to cervical cancer was significantly higher among women assigned to intervention ( 39.0 % vs. 25.7 % , p < 0.001); this corresponds to a difference of 13.3 % ( 95 % CI 8.1 to 18.5). The difference in adherence between an invitation strategy based only on text messages and reminders and the standard of care was -0.4 % , 95 % CI -5.3 to 4.5. In conclusion , an invitation to cervical cancer screening using automated text messages/phone calls and reminders increases the adherence to cervical cancer screening. Such a low-cost and operator-independent strategy of invitation may contribute to the sustainability of organized screening programs. NCT03122275.
