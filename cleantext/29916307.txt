  Intervertebral disc ( IVD) degeneration is characterized by an unbalanced cell catabolic/anabolic activity and cell death , resulting in the degradation of extracellular matrix ( ECM) components and water loss. Repopulating the IVD with new cells may help recovering tissue homeostasis and revert the degenerative process. Here the regenerative potential of a hyaluronan based ( HA)- chemoattractant delivery system able to recruit Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs) seeded on the cartilaginous endplate ( CEP) of IVD was explored. A HA delivery system containing stromal cell derived factor-1 ( SDF-1) ( 5 ng/ÂµL) ( HAPSDF5) was injected in the cavity of a nucleotomized bovine discs. Human MSCs ( 1x106) were seeded on the opposite CEP and allowed to migrate for up to 21 days. Migration of fluorescently labelled-MSCs from CEP towards the IVD was enhanced by HAPSDF5. Likewise , an increase collagen type II ( col<pathogen> type II) was detected at earlier time points , whereas no effect on proteoglycan content within the nucleotomized IVDs was found. MSCs produced an increased concentration of pro-catabolic factors , such as IL-6 , IL-8 and MCP-I. Overall , this study demonstrates that HAPSDF5 increased MSCs recruitment , while the higher number of recruited cells partially contributed to accelerate matrix remodelling in nucleotomized IVDs.
