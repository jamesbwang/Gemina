  Essentials The risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) after lumbar spine surgery ( LBS) is not precisely known. More than 320 000 patients who underwent LBS in France between 2009 and 2014 were followed-up. The overall risk of VTE after LBS is less than 1 % but modulated by patient and procedural factors. Surgical device implantation , anterior approach and complex surgery increase the risk of VTE. Background Postoperative venous thromboembolism ( VTE) is a severe complication , the risk of which after lumbar spine surgery ( LBS) is not precisely known. Objective To estimate the incidence of VTE after LBS , and to identify individual and surgical risk factors. Methods All patients aged > 18 years who underwent LBS in France between 2009 and 2014 were identified. Among 477 024 patients screened , exclusions concerned recent VTE or surgery , and multiple surgeries during the same hospital stay. Results In 323 737 patients ( mean age 52.9 years , 51.4 % male) , we observed 2911 events ( 0.91 %) after a median time of 12 days ( Q1-Q3: 5-72 days). The multivariate adjusted Cox model showed increased risks associated with age ( 4 % per year of age; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 3.8-4.3) , obesity ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.32 , 95 % CI 1.18-1.46) , active cancer ( HR 1.65 , 95 % CI 1.5-1.82) , previous thromboembolism ( HR 5.41 , 95 % CI 4.74-6.17) , severe<symptom> paralysis<symptom> ( HR 1.47 , 95 % CI 1.17-1.84) , renal disease ( HR 1.28 , 95 % CI 1.04-1.6) , psychiatric disease ( HR 1.21 , 95 % CI 1.1-1.32) , use of antidepressants ( HR 1.13 , 95 % CI 1.03-1.24) , use of contraceptives ( HR 1.56 , 95 % CI 1.19-2.03) , extended surgery for scoliosis ( HR 3.61 , 95 % CI 2.96-4.4) , implantation of pedicular screws with a ` dose-effect ' association , and an anterior approach ( HR 1.97 , 95 % CI 1.6-2.43) or a combined approach ( HR 2.03 , 95 % CI 1.44-2.84). Conclusions The overall VTE risk after LBS is moderate ( < 1 %) but is widely modulated by several easily identifiable risk factors. The surgical community should be aware of this heterogeneity , adapt prevention according to patients and to the procedure , and use drug prophylaxis in the event of a high risk being present.
