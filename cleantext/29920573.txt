  The extraordinary physicochemical properties of graphene-based nanomaterials ( GBNs) make them promising tools in nanotechnology and biomedicine. Considering the skin contact as one of the most feasible exposure routes to GBNs , the mechanism of toxicity of two GBNs ( few-layer-graphene , FLG , and graphene oxide , GO) towards human HaCaT skin keratinocytes was investigated. Both materials induced a significant mitochondrial membrane depolarization: 72 h cell exposure to 100 μg mL-1 FLG or GO increased mitochondrial depolarization by 44 % and 56 % , respectively , while the positive control valinomycin ( 0.1 μg mL-1) increased mitochondrial depolarization by 48 %. Since the effect was not prevented by cyclosporine-A , it appears to be unrelated to mitochondrial transition pore opening. By contrast , it seems to be mediated by reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production: FLG and GO induced time- and concentration-dependent cellular ROS production , significant already at the concentration of 0.4 μg mL-1 after 24 h exposure. Among a panel of specific inhibitors of the major ROS-producing enzymes , diphenyliodonium , rotenone and allopurinol significantly reverted or even abolished FLG- or GO-induced ROS production. Intriguingly , the same inhibitors also significantly reduced FLG- or GO-induced mitochondrial depolarization and cytotoxicity. This study shows that FLG and GO induce a cytotoxic effect due to a sustained mitochondrial depolarization. This seems to be mediated by a significant cellular ROS production , caused by the activation of flavoprotein-based oxidative enzymes , such as NADH dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase.
