  Phosphobacteria , secreting organic acids and phosphatases , usually favor plant performance in acidic soils by increasing phosphorus ( P) availability and aluminum ( Al) complexing. However , it is not well-known how P-deficiency and Al-toxicity affect the phosphobacteria physiology. Since P and Al problems often co-occur in acidic soils , we have therefore proposed the evaluation of the single and combined effects of P-deficiency and Al-toxicity on growth , organic acids secretion , malate dehydrogenase (
