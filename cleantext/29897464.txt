  In Central Europe , the most abundant aphid infesting the leaves of small grain cereals is Metopolophium dirhodum ( Walker) ( Homoptera: Aphididae). Annual variation in its seasonal dynamics was evaluated using a 25-yr series of standardized weekly censuses of winter wheat plots. M. dirhodum made up > 50 % of the aphids on the foliage. Date of immigration ( 8 May-3 July) , length of period of population increase ( 0-9 wk) , and date of attaining maximum abundance ( 28 May-22 July) varied greatly. For the prediction , we regressed maximum numbers/tiller on numbers recorded in the first week after heading. The regression of maximum abundance on nonzero aphid counts revealed a critical number of ≥ 1.50 aphids/tiller , which if exceeded resulted in a harmful maximum abundance of ≥ 10 aphids/tiller at the peak. Zero aphid counts resulted in 10 % of cases with a harmful maximum abundance. Using this regression for prediction will result in 18 % of the recorded cases being false negatives and 9 % false positives. Parallel annual variation in the average maximum numbers of M. dirhodum , Sitobion avenae<pathogen> ( Fabricius) ( Homoptera: Aphididae) , and Rhopalosiphum padi ( Linné) ( Homoptera: Aphididae) indicated the following factors that affected their abundance: temperature in winter and host plant quality. The predictions apply only in areas where M. dirhodum is holocyclic and aphids do not overwinter in wheat stands.
