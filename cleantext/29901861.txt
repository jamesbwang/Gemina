  Recent advances in mass spectrometry ( MS)- based technologies are now set to transform translational cancer proteomics from an idea to a practice. Here , we present a robust proteomic workflow for the analysis of clinically relevant human cancer tissues that allows quantitation of thousands of tumor proteins in several hours of measuring time and a total turnaround of a few days. We applied it to a chemorefractory metastatic case of the extremely rare urachal carcinoma. Quantitative comparison of lung metastases and surrounding tissue revealed several significantly upregulated proteins , among them lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 ( LSD1/KDM1A). LSD1 is an epigenetic regulator and the target of active development efforts in oncology. Thus , clinical cancer proteomics can rapidly and efficiently identify actionable therapeutic options. While currently described for a single case study , we envision that it can be applied broadly to other patients in a similar condition.
