  The Model of Human Occupation ( MOHO) is a widely used conceptual practice model in Finland. Therefore , Finnish translations of valid and reliable MOHO assessments are needed. The primary objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Finnish translation of the Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills ( ACIS-FI) using the many-facet Rasch model approach. Twenty-eight occupational therapists completed an in-person training workshop on the ACIS-FI and participated as raters in this study. One hundred and forty-eight clients were rated using the ACIS-FI. Rating scale functioning , unidimensionality , person validity and rater severity , item targeting , and item and person separation statistics were examined. The rating scales demonstrated adequate functioning; the rating category ` deficit ' was infrequently adopted by the raters. The ACIS-FI had satisfactory construct validity , as confirmed by all items exhibiting unidimensionality within a single construct ( i.e. communication and interaction skills) , and appropriate item fit. Validity was further confirmed through low person misfit ( 6 %) and low rater misfit ( 3.6 %). No ceiling or floor effects were found. The ACIS-FI was able to separate clients into four levels of communication and interaction skills. This study offers evidence for the validity of the ACIS-FI as a measure of communication and interaction skills in occupational therapy. The ACIS-FI offers Finnish practitioners and researchers a valid tool to measure communication and interactions skills that is theoretically grounded in the MOHO.
