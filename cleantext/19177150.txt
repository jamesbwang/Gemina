  Adult mammalian skin has a defective regenerative capacity following full-thickness cutaneous injury; this defect overshadows the complete physiological functions of the skin. Immune-mediated skin reconstruction driven by biological scaffolds is a recently developed innovative repair strategy to support regenerative wound<disease> healing. However , to date , little is known about how biological scaffolds orchestrate the immune response to promote regeneration. Here , using acellular dermal matrix ( ADM) scaffolds , we discovered that the default pro-inflammatory response was altered in response to a pro-regenerative response characterized by specific M2 polarization. M2 macrophages subsequently produced a series of wound<disease> healing factors , including matrix metalloproteinases ( Mmps) , and growth factors which promoted cell proliferation , stabilized angiogenesis , and remodeled the extracellular matrix. Our investigations further revealed that the M2 polarization of macrophages arose from an ADM scaffold-derived amino acid sufficiency signal by collagen degradation via macrophage phagocytosis , which activated the acid-sensing pathway ( v-ATPase , Lamtor1 , and mTORC1). Lamtor1 , the acid-sensing pathway-associated lysosomal adaptor protein was critical for inducing M2 polarization , while with the presence of extracellular interleukin 4 ( IL4). Our results suggest that ADM scaffolds generate a pro-regenerative microenvironment during full-thickness cutaneous<disease> wound<disease> healing through M2 macrophage polarization via Lamtor1.
