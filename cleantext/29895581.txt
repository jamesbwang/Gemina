  Sleep is nearly ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom , yet little is known about how ecological factors or perturbations to the environment shape the duration and timing of sleep. In diverse animal taxa , poor sleep negatively impacts development , cognitive abilities and longevity. In addition to mammals , sleep has been characterized in genetic model organisms , ranging from the nematode worm to zebrafish , and , more recently , in emergent models with simplified nervous systems such as
