  Dysregulation of nuclear envelope ( NE) assembly results in various cancers; for example , renal and some lung carcinomas ensue due to NE malformation. The NE is a dynamic membrane compartment and its completion during mitosis , is a highly regulated process but the detailed mechanism still remains incompletely understood. Previous studies have found isolated diacylglycerol ( DAG) containing vesicles are essential for completing the fusion of NE in non-somatic cells. We investigated the impact of DAG depletion from cis-Golgi in mammalian cells on NE reassembly. Using advanced electron microscopy , we observed an enriched DAG population of vesicles at the vicinity of the NE gaps of telophase mammalian cells. We applied a miniSOG-C1-domain tag that localized DAG-enriched vesicles at the perinuclear region , which suggested the existence of NE fusogenic vesicles. We quantified the impact of Golgi-DAG depletion by measuring the in situ NE rim curvature of the re-forming NE. The rim curvature in these cells was significantly reduced compared with controls , which indicated a localized defect in NE morphology. Our novel results demonstrate the significance of the role of DAG from cis-Golgi for the regulation of NE assembly.
