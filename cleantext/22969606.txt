  This review presents the up to date development of fused thiopyranothiazoles that comprise one of the thiazolidine derivatives classes. Thiazolidine and thiazolidinone-related compounds belong to the widely studied heterocycles from a medicinal chemistry perspective. From the chemical point of view , they are perfect heterodienes to undergo
