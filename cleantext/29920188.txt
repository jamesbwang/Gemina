  Myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs) densely accumulate into tumors and potently suppress anti-tumor immune responses promoting tumor development. Targeting MDSCs in tumor immunotherapy has been hampered by lack of understanding of the molecular pathways that govern MDSC differentiation and function. Herein , we identify autophagy as a crucial pathway for MDSC-mediated suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Specifically , MDSCs in melanoma patients and mouse melanoma exhibited increased levels of functional autophagy. Ablation of autophagy in myeloid cells , significantly delayed tumor growth and endowed anti-tumor immune responses. Notably , tumor-infiltrating autophagy-deficient monocytic MDSCs ( M-MDSCs) demonstrated impaired suppressive activity in vitro and in vivo , while transcriptome analysis revealed significant differences in genes related to lysosomal function. Accordingly , autophagy-deficient M-MDSCs exhibited impaired lysosomal degradation thereby enhancing surface expression of MHC class II molecules , resulting in efficient activation of tumor-specific CD4 + T cells. Finally , targeting of the membrane-associated RING-CH1 ( MARCH1) E3 ubiquitin ligase , that mediates the lysosomal degradation of MHC II , in M-MDSCs , attenuated their suppressive function , and resulted in significantly decreased tumor volume followed by development of a robust anti-tumor immunity. Collectively , these findings depict autophagy as a novel molecular target of MDSC-mediated suppression of anti-tumor immunity.
