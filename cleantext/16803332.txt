  Bismuth-based solar absorbers have recently garnered attention due to their promise as cheap , nontoxic , and efficient photovoltaics. To date , however , most show poor efficiencies far below those seen in commercial technologies. In this work , we investigate two such promising materials , BiSI and BiSeI , using relativistic first-principles methods with the aim of identifying their suitability for photovoltaic applications. Both compounds show excellent optoelectronic properties with ideal band gaps and strong optical absorption , leading to high predicted device performance. Using defect analysis , we reveal the electronic and structural effects that can lead to the presence of deep trap states , which may help explain the prior poor performance of these materials. Crucially , detailed mapping of the range of experimentally accessible synthesis conditions allows us to provide strategies to avoid the formation of killer defects in the future.
