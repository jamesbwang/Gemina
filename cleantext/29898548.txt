  The parent activated carbon ( ACP) was modified with urea and thiourea to obtain N-doped activated carbon ( ACN) and N , S co-doped activated carbon ( ACNS) , respectively. Iron supported on activated carbon ( Fe/ACP , Fe/ACN and Fe/ACNS) were prepared and worked as catalyst for catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of benzoic acid ( BA). The catalysts were characterized by N
