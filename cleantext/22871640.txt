  The effects of the addition of Sr on the microstructures , mechanical properties and bio-corrosion properties of Mg-2Zn alloys were investigated. Examination of the microstructures indicates that Sr addition promoted grain refinement and the formation of secondary phases. The results for the mechanical and corrosion property analyses show that the Mg-2Zn-0.2 Sr alloy exhibited the best mechanical properties and bio-corrosion resistance. Notably , fine grain structure can promote strength and ductility , while the excessive secondary phases Mg
