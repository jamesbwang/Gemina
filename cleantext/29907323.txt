  Systematic measurement of healthcare services enables evaluation of health professionals ' quality of work. Whereas policy makers find measurement a useful mechanism for quality improvement , a public choice perspective implies that physicians would resent such an initiative , which undermines their professional autonomy. In this article , we compare two healthcare systems of economically developed countries- Israel and the UK. Both systems share common features such as universal coverage , strong state intervention , and enthusiasm for New Public Management. In both countries , quality measurement was introduced in acute care hospitals at around the same time. However , while the UK succeeded in establishing a framework of surgical outcome measures during the 2000s , a similar initiative in Israel failed completely during the 1990s. We also refer to subsequent quality indicator efforts in Israel , in both community and hospital frameworks , that were more successful , but in a way that reinforces our central thesis. We contend that differences in reform outcomes stem from the medical profession 's reaction to government 's endeavors. This response , in turn , hinges on the professional organizations ' relative institutional position vis-a-vis state authorities. This study constitutes a unique investigation of the medical profession 's response to critical quality measurement reforms. Most importantly , it stresses the institutional position of medical associations as the primary factor in explaining cross-case variation in government 's success in introducing quality measurement.
