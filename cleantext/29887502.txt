  Because Japan has high suicide rates and low violent crime rates , it is likely that most abdominal stab wounds<disease> ( ASWs) in Japan are self-inflicted. Although physical examination is one of the most important factors in surgical decision making , such evaluations can be difficult in patients with self-inflicted ASWs due to patient agitation and uncooperative behavior. Therefore , the self-inflicted nature of an injury may strongly affect clinical practice , particularly in Japan , but its influence remains uncertain. We hypothesized that the rates of exploratory laparotomy and nontherapeutic laparotomy ( NTL) would be higher in self-inflicted patients. We reviewed ASW patients from 2004 to 2014 in the Japan Trauma Data Bank. The rates of exploratory laparotomy and NTL were compared between self-inflicted and non-self-inflicted ASWs. Of the 1705 eligible patients , 1302 patients ( 76.4 %) had self-inflicted ASWs , and 403 patients ( 23.6 %) had non-self-inflicted ASWs. Self-inflicted patients had a significantly higher rate of psychiatric history , but lower injury severity. The in-hospital mortality rate was similar between the two groups ( 4.5 % vs. 5.2 % , p = 0.576). Self-inflicted patients had significantly higher rates of exploratory laparotomy and NTL ( 69.1 % vs. 56.7 % , p < 0.001 , 22.5 % vs. 13.6 % , p = 0.03 , respectively). Self-inflicted patients were also associated with significantly longer hospital stays ( 10.0 ( 5.0-21.0) vs. 9.0 ( 4.0-18.0) days , P = 0.045). In a multivariable analysis , self-inflicted patients were independently associated with exploratory laparotomy ( odds ratio ( OR) , 2.05; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.55-2.72) and NTL ( OR , 1.61; 95 % CI: 1.01-2.56). ASWs in Japan were predominantly self-inflicted. The clinical patterns of self-inflicted ASWs had some unique features. Patients with self-inflicted ASWs had higher rates of laparotomy and NTL. Further studies are needed to develop a useful protocol specific to self-inflicted ASWs.
