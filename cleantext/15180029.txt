  Tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC) is an autosomal-dominant neurocutaneous disorder characterized by lesions<symptom> and benign tumors in multiple organ systems including the brain , skin , heart , eyes , kidneys , and lungs. The phenotype is highly variable , although penetrance is reportedly complete. We report the molecular diagnosis of TSC in individuals exhibiting extreme intra-familial variability , including the incidental diagnosis of asymptomatic family members. Exome sequencing was performed in three families , with probands referred for epilepsy , autism , and absent<symptom> speech<symptom> ( Family 1); epileptic spasms ( Family 2); and connective tissue disorders ( Family 3.) Pathogenic variants in TSC1 or TSC2 were identified in nine individuals , including relatives with limited or no medical concerns at the time of testing. Of the nine individuals reported here , six had post-diagnosis examinations and three met clinical diagnostic criteria for TSC. One did not meet clinical criteria for a possible or definite diagnosis of TSC , and two had only a possible clinical diagnosis following post-diagnosis workup. These individuals as well as their mothers demonstrated limited features that would not raise concern for TSC in the absence of molecular results. In addition , three individuals exhibited epilepsy with normal brain MRIs , and two without seizures<symptom> or intellectual disability had MRI findings fulfilling major criteria for TSC highlighting the difficulty providers face when relying on clinical criteria to guide genetic testing. Given the importance of a timely TSC diagnosis for clinical management , such cases demonstrate a potential benefit for clinical criteria to include seizures<symptom> and an unbiased molecular approach to genetic testing.
