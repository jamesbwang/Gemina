  This paper presents a physiological model to reproduce hemodynamic responses to blood volume perturbation. The model consists of three sub-models: a control-theoretic model relating blood volume response to blood volume perturbation; a simple physics-based model relating blood volume to stroke volume and cardiac output; and a phenomenological model relating cardiac output to blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. A unique characteristic of this model is its balance<symptom> for simplicity and physiological transparency. Initial validity of the model was examined using experimental data collected from 11 animals. The model may serve as a viable basis for the design and evaluation of closed-loop fluid resuscitation controllers.
