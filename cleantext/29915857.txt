  To develop a valid and reliable measurement tool to determine the anxiety<symptom> level of pregnant women in labor. Methods: This study is a methodological research for developing an Anxiety<symptom> Assessment Scale for Pregnant Women in Labor ( AASPWL) and descriptive research for determining the anxiety<symptom> level of pregnant women in labor. This study included a total of 269 pregnant women from the delivery room of a training and research hospital between November 2016 and July 2017. The study consists of 2 stages: the first stage includes scale content , construct validity , and reliability; the second stage involves examination of the relationship and effects by establishing a model with the Beck Anxiety<symptom> Inventory ( BAI). Construct validity was established using a confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA) and an exploratory factor analysis ( EFA). Cronbach 's alpha value was calculated to be 0.77 for the reliability of the developed AASPWL. Conclusion: The AASPWL is a reliable and valid scale that can be used to assess the anxiety<symptom> level of women in labor.
