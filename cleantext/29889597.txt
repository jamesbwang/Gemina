  To assess the feasibility and clinical impact of brain-targeted treatment ( BT; aiming to target sensorimotor processing) in knee osteoarthritis patients attending tertiary care. Randomized replicated case series. The study involved three phases , each of 2 weeks duration: ( 1) no-treatment phase; ( 2) BT phase ( left/right judgments and touch discrimination training); and ( 3) usual care ( education , strengthening , and stretching training). Primary outcomes were: timely recruitment; number of participants completing the interventions; treatment compliance and barriers; follow-up rates; and treatment impact on pain and function. Fear-avoidance beliefs and clinical measures of cortical body representation ( tactile acuity and left/right judgment performance) were secondary outcomes. A total of 5 % ( 19/355) of all assessed patients were eligible to participate and of these , 58 % ( 11/19) agreed to participate. Ten patients completed the study , and 9 were successfully followed up , with treatment compliance varying between interventions. Compliance was poor for the touch discrimination component of BT. No significant effects were observed for pain relief or knee function after any treatment. A positive impact of treatment was found for fear-avoidance beliefs ( usual care vs. washout , p = 0.007; BT vs. washout , p = 0.029) and left/right judgment accuracy ( usual care vs. washout; p = 0.006). Clear barriers were identified to implementing BT in tertiary care for knee osteoarthritis. Access to all available services ( especially the use of interpreters) , and treatment options that do not require additional assistance to perform ( e.g. , touch discrimination training) represent the main lessons learned.
