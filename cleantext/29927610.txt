  In this Mini<pathogen> Review , we summarize major corrections to the dark-bright exciton theory ( Efros et al.. Phys. Rev B 1996 , 54 , 4843- 4856) , which should be used for quantitative description of the band edge exciton in II-VI and III-V compound quantum-dot nanocrystals ( NCs). The theory previously did not take into account the long-range exchange interaction , resulting in the under-estimation of the splitting between the upper bright and lower dark or quasi-dark exciton , as reported by several experimental groups. Another type of correction originates from the closeness in energy of the ground , 1S
