  Numerous studies have reported that post-exercise ingestion of carbohydrates with protein supplementation can enhance glycogen recovery. However , few reports have focused on the degrees of degradation of the ingested proteins due to post-exercise glycogen resynthesis. Accordingly , the aim of this study was to clarify the effects of differences in protein degradation on muscle glycogen recovery. Male seven-week-old C57BL/6J mice performed a single bout of 60-min treadmill running exercise and were then orally administered glucose ( Glu; 1.5 mg/g body<symptom> weight ( BW)) , glucose with casein peptide ( Glu + Pep; 1.5 + 0.5 mg/g BW) or its constituent amino acid mixture ( Glu + AA; 1.5 + 0.5 mg/g BW). At 120 min after supplementation , the soleus muscle glycogen content in the Glu and Glu + AA groups was significantly higher than that immediately after exercise; however , no such difference was observed in the Glu + Pep group. Blood substrate concentration and insulin signaling did not differ among the three groups. Furthermore , energy expenditure during the recovery period in the Glu + Pep group was significantly higher than that in the Glu and Glu + AA groups. These findings suggest that post-exercise co-ingestion of glucose and casein peptide might delay glycogen resynthesis , at least in part through increased energy expenditure caused by casein peptide ingestion.
