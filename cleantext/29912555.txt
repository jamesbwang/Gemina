  Noble metal catalysts , in particular palladium-containing materials , are of prime commercial interest , because of their role as oxidation catalysts in automobile emission-control systems and reforming catalysts for the production of high-octane gasoline. However , despite almost two centuries of research , the precise structure of such materials is still ill-defined on the sub-nanometer scale , which severely limits the understanding of the underlying catalytic mechanisms. As a burgeoning class of structurally well-defined noble metal oxide nanoclusters , polyoxopalladates ( POPs) have been highly rated as ideal models to fully decipher the molecular mechanism of noble metal-based catalysis. Being at the frontier of polyoxometalates ( POMs) , the chemistry of POPs , which are based exclusively on Pd
