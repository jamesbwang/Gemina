  Vortices , occurring whenever a flow field ` whirls ' around a one-dimensional core , are among the simplest topological structures , ubiquitous to many branches of physics. In the crystalline state , vortex formation is rare , since it is generally hampered by long-range interactions: in ferroic materials ( ferromagnetic and ferroelectric) , vortices are observed only when the effects of the dipole-dipole interaction are modified by confinement at the nanoscale
