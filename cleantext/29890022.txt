  Maintaining protein homeostasis ( proteostasis) is essential for a functional proteome. A wide range of extrinsic and intrinsic factors perturb proteostasis , causing protein misfolding , misassembly , and aggregation. This compromises cellular integrity and leads to aging and disease , including neurodegeneration and cancer. At the cellular level , protein aggregation is counteracted by powerful mechanisms comprising of a cascade of enzymes and chaperones that operate in a coordinated multistep manner to sense , prevent , and/or dispose of aberrant proteins. Although these processes are well understood for soluble proteins , there is a major gap in our understanding of how cells handle misfolded or aggregated membrane proteins. This article provides an overview of cellular proteostasis with emphasis on membrane protein substrates and suggests host-virus interaction as a tool to clarify outstanding questions in proteostasis.
