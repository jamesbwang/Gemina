  Single Fe atoms dispersed on hierarchically structured porous carbon ( SA-Fe-HPC) frameworks are prepared by pyrolysis of unsubstituted phthalocyanine/iron phthalocyanine complexes confined within micropores of the porous carbon support. The single-atom Fe catalysts have a well-defined atomic dispersion of Fe atoms coordinated by N ligands on the 3D hierarchically porous carbon support. These SA-Fe-HPC catalysts are comparable to the commercial Pt/C electrode even in acidic electrolytes for oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) in terms of the ORR activity ( E
