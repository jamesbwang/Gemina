  We present computational evidence utilizing vertical electronic excitation energies and the corresponding excess dipole moments of solvated p-nitroaniline ( pNA). The properties of interest are calculated by employing the equation of motion coupled cluster together with single and double excitations ( EOM-CCSD). Solvent effects are included through the polarizable continuum model ( PCM) with the state-specific ( SS) formalism and the perturbation theory energy and density ( PTED) approach. We examine the ground state equilibrium geometry of pNA in different environments to yield the symmetry of the stable conformer of solvated pNA is C
