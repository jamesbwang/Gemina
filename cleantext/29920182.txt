  Abstract In most schools of nursing , students rate their satisfaction with courses and teachers at the end of the semester. Low response rates on these evaluations make it difficult to interpret the results. Students were incentivized to complete their course evaluations by adding 1-2 points to one test score in the course in exchange for 85 % or higher participation by the total cohort. Ongoing monitoring and communication to students by faculty during the process was critical to motivating students to complete course evaluations. When the incentive was employed , student participation ranged from a low of 90 % to a high of 100 % response rate. The added points did not change any of the students ' grades. Incentivizing students to complete course evaluations is an effective strategy to boost response rates without changing final course grades.
