  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is a multifactorial disease that involves a complex interaction between genetics , diet , and lifestyle. Although closely related with obese subjects , it is also common in lean humans. This study aimed to characterize the diet and lifestyle of lean and obese NAFLD patients in China. To characterize the diet and lifestyle of lean and obese NAFLD patients , we conducted a matched case-control study that included 351 Chinese adults. General characteristics , dietary intake , and lifestyle were gathered by using a valid and reliable dietary questionnaire. We compared the dietary intake and lifestyle between lean and obese NAFLD patients. All NAFLD patients had more total caloric , calorigenic nutrients ( carbohydrate , fat , and protein) , grain , potato , fruit , and iron with higher levels of waist circumference and overtime work but shorter sleep duration than their corresponding controls. Particularly , lean NAFLD patients consumed comparable total caloric , calorigenic nutrients , iron , sleep duration , and overtime work as obese NAFLD patients , though they consumed lower levels of grain , potato , and fruit ( lean NAFLD patients vs. obese NAFLD patients: mean ± SD , g/day grain: 291.8 ± 83.8 , 365.2 ± 89.0; potato: 63.5 ± 33.1 , 80.4 ± 37.6; fruit: 324.3 ± 148.4 , 414.0 ± 220.4; P < 0.0001). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients had higher total caloric , calorigenic nutrients , grain , potato , fruit , iron , and overtime work but shorter sleep duration. Lean NAFLD patients had comparable total caloric , calorigenic nutrients , iron , sleep duration , and overtime work as obese NAFLD patients. These features could be used to the nutritional education and therapeutic guidance for lean NAFLD patients in the future.
