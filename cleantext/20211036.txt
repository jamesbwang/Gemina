  Effects of early enteral nutrition ( EEN) or total parenteral nutrition ( TPN) support on nutritional status and blood glucose in patients with gastric cancer complicated with diabetes mellitus after radical gastrectomy were investigated. One hundred and twenty-nine patients with gastric cancer complicated with diabetes mellitus type 2 admitted to the First People 's Hospital of Jinan ( Jinan , China) , from June 2012 to June 2016 were selected into the study. According to different nutrition support pathways , these patients were randomly divided into the EEN group and the TPN group. The improvement of nutritional indexes , postoperative complications , gastrointestinal function recovery and perioperative blood glucose fluctuation were compared between the two groups. On the 4th day after operation , the improvement levels of total bilirubin ( TBL) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , aspartate transaminase ( AST) , total protein ( TP) , prealbumin ( PAB) , hemoglobin ( HGB) and weight ( Wt) in the EEN group were significantly higher than those in the conventional group ( P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups on the 8th day after operation ( P > 0.05). No patients had complications in the EEN group , while a total of 29 patients in the TPN group suffered adverse reactions , indicating that the incidence rate of complications in the EEN group was significantly lower than that in the TPN group ( P < 0.05). The postoperative evacuation time was earlier , hospitalization time was shorter and cost of postoperative hospitalization was less in the EEN group than those in the TPN group , and the differences were statistically significant ( P < 0.05). The blood glucose fluctuation values at fasting and 2 h after a meal in the TPN group were higher than those in the EEN group within 8 days after operation , and the differences were statistically significant ( Ï‡
