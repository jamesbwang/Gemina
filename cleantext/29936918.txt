  The aim of this study was to determine whether vitamin D supplementation and maintaining vitamin D sufficiency are associated with changes in inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in patients with knee osteoarthritis ( OA) and vitamin D deficiency. A total of 413 participants with symptomatic knee OA and vitamin D deficiency were enrolled in a randomised , placebo-controlled trial and received 1 · 25 mg vitamin D3 or placebo monthly for 24 months across two sites. In this post hoc analysis , 200 participants from one site ( ninety-four from the placebo group and 106 from the vitamin D group; mean age 63 · 1 ( sd 7 · 3) years , 53 · 3 % women) were randomly selected for measurement of serum levels of inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers at baseline and 24 months using immunoassays. In addition , participants were classified into two groups according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D levels at months 3 and 24: ( 1) not consistently sufficient ( 25 ( OH) D ≤ 50 nmol/l at either month 3 or 24 , n 61) , and ( 2) consistently sufficient ( 25 ( OH) D > 50 nmol/l at both months 3 and 24 , n 139). Compared with placebo , vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on change in serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , leptin , adiponectin , resistin , adipsin and apelin. Being consistently vitamin D sufficient over 2 years was also not associated with changes in these biomarkers compared with not being consistently sufficient. Vitamin D supplementation and maintaining vitamin D sufficiency did not alter serum levels of inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers over 2 years in knee OA patients who were vitamin D insufficient , suggesting that they may not affect systemic inflammation<symptom> in knee OA patients.
