  The evaluation of results after middle ear reconstruction has been mainly based on functional parameters. In clinical practice as well as in otological research , the pure tone audiogram represents the gold standard in the assessment of the postoperative outcome. In order to assess the patient 's subjective outcome , outcome analyzes focus increasingly on the health-related quality of life ( HRQOL). However , the evaluation of HRQOL requires reliable and validated measuring instruments. A modest number of validated questionnaires for determination of the disease-specific HRQOL in patients with chronic<disease> otitis<disease> media<disease> and/or conductive hearing loss are currently available. Three of seven available questionnaires were developed and validated in the German-speaking countries , the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory 21 ( ZCMEI-21) , the Chronic<disease> Otitis<disease> Media<disease> Outcome Test 15 ( COMOT-15) and the Stapesplasty Outcome Test 25 ( SPOT-25). In this review , all seven available disease-specific measuring instruments as well as the generic questionnaires , which were used in previous clinical trials , are explained and current findings of quality-of-life research in patients with chronic<disease> otitis<disease> media<disease> and/or conductive hearing loss are presented.
