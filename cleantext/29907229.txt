  Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in trauma care and outcomes among young adults are well documented. As the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion has increased insurance coverage among young adults , we aimed to investigate its impact on disparities in insurance coverage and outcomes among hospitalized young adult trauma patients. We used the healthcare cost and utilization project state inpatient databases to examine changes in insurance coverage and risk-adjusted outcomes from before ( 2012-2013) to after ( 2014) Medicaid expansion among young adults ( age 19-44) hospitalized for injury across 11 Medicaid expansion states. Changes were compared across racial/ethnic and community-level income groups. We also compared changes in disparities between three expansion and three nonexpansion states in the US south. In the first year of Medicaid expansion , non-Hispanic black trauma patients experienced a large decrease in uninsurance ( 34.3 % -14.2 % , P < 0.01) , reducing the disparity in uninsurance between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white patients ( P < 0.05). There were no differences across racial/ethnic groups in changes in in-hospital mortality , failure to rescue , discharge to rehabilitation , or 30-d unplanned readmissions. Socioeconomic disparities in discharge to rehabilitation decreased ( 1.63 % versus 0.06 % increase among patients from the lowest and highest income communities , P < 0.05). In contrast , in the selected southern states , Medicaid expansion was associated with the introduction of a disparity in discharge to inpatient rehabilitation between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites. Medicaid expansion , in its first year , decreased racial and socioeconomic disparities in uninsurance and socioeconomic disparities in access to rehabilitation.
