  Pharmacological labour induction is obtained through prostaglandins application and/or oxytocin infusion; however the use seems related to foetal and maternal side effects. Traditional Chinese Medicine advocates the use of acupuncture to soften the cervix and induce uterine contractions. The primary outcome was the rate of women submitted to labour induction for prolonged pregnancy at 41 +5 weeks , the secondary outcome was the rate of induction planned for other indications. After informed consent , 375 undelivered women after 40 +2 gestational age were enrolled for the study: 112 women received acupuncture and 263 routine care. Acupuncture was applied every odd day starting from 40 +2 weeks up to 41 +4 weeks. Women allocated to control group received standard care. At 41 +5 weeks a pharmacological induction was planned. The rate of labour induction significantly differed between acupuncture and observationgroups ( 19.6 % versus 38 % %; p < 0.01); in particular women receiving acupuncture showed a lower rate of inductions indicates for prolonged pregnancy ( 5.3 % vs 10.1 %; p < 0.01). As far as the pharmacological device is concerned , no differences were observed with regard to the prostaglandins use , while oxytocin infusion rate was lower in the acupuncture than in the observation group. The present study suggested that acupuncture applied at term of pregnancy seems effective in reducing the rate of labour induction performed for prolonged pregnancy at 41 +5 weeks. Moreover , acupuncture also seems to be able to reduce oxytocin use; such a `` saving '' effect could play a role in childhood , considering that a recent study underlined the adverse effect of oxytocin on birth outcomes.
