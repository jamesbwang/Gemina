  Evidence suggests that economic factors play an important role in commercial sex work , in particular that condomless sex commands a price premium relative to condom-protected sex. This paper explores whether the use of a new HIV<pathogen> prevention product , with 100 % efficacy but modeled after pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP) , could change the price and quantity of condomless commercial sex supplied. We collected stated preference data from 122 HIV-negative female sex workers in urban South Africa , using a repeated choice experiment to simulate the impact of using PrEP on choices. Results suggest that the price premium for condomless sex would decrease by 73 % with PrEP use and the quantity of condomless sex is predicted to increase by a factor of 2.27. Act price does not significantly affect choices without protection but strongly influences choices under full HIV<pathogen> protection. The utility offered by condoms reduces by around 15 % under PrEP use. Because new HIV<pathogen> prevention products do not protect against other STIs or pregnancy , the unintended consequences of introducing HIV<pathogen> prevention products should be closely monitored , whereas users should not face stigma or blame for reacting rationally to exogenous changes to market conditions.
