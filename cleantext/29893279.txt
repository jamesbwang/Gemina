  To monitor cellular and metabolic characteristics of glioblastoma ( GBM) over the course of standard 6-week chemoradiation treatment with chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST)- MRI; and to identify the earliest time point CEST could determine subsequent therapeutic response. Nineteen patients with newly diagnosed GBM were recruited , and CEST-MRI was acquired immediately before ( Day Changes in MTR Chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST) provides imaging-based biomarkers of GBM response as early as 2 weeks into the treatment. Certain CEST metrics can characterize tumor aggressiveness and identify early progressors even before beginning the treatment. Such an early biomarker of response may allow for adjusting the GBM treatment plan for adaptive radiation therapy in early progressors and more confidently continuing standard adjuvant treatment for nonprogressors.
