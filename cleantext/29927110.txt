  Most structural techniques provide averaged information or information about a single predominant conformational state. However , biological macromolecules typically function through series of conformations. Therefore , a complete understanding of macromolecular structures requires knowledge of the ensembles that represent probabilities on a conformational free energy landscape. Here we describe an emerging approach , X-ray scattering interferometry ( XSI) , a method that provides instantaneous distance distributions for molecules in solution. XSI uses gold nanocrystal labels site-specifically attached to a macromolecule and measures the scattering interference from pairs of heavy metal labels. The recorded signal can directly be transformed into a distance distribution between the two probes. We describe the underlying concepts , present a detailed protocol for preparing samples and recording XSI data , and provide a custom-written graphical user interface to facilitate XSI data analysis.
