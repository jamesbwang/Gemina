  Accurate regulation of tissue- and stage-specific expression of genes is prerequisite for normal development in organisms. DNA methylation plays an important role in modulating gene expression in mammals and plants. However , there is no direct evidence showing how DNA methylation regulates gene transcription in insects. During the development of Bombyx mori wing , the expression level of DNA methyltransferase 1 ( BmDnmt1) gradually declined and became stationary at pupal stage , resulting in a lower methylation rate of the intragenic promoter of the mid-pupal wing-specific gene BmCHSA-2b , an epidermal chitin synthase controlling mid-pupal wing development in B. mori. The higher methylation rate of the promoter in the pupal epidermis was decreased and BmCHSA-2b transcription was significantly increased by the treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor , 5-azacytidine-2 '- deoxycytidine , suggesting that DNA methylation regulates the tissue-specific expression of BmCHSA-2b. Pupa-specific transcription factor BmDEAF1 bound to the unmethylated intragenic promoter and activated the BmCHSA-2b transcription in the mid-pupal wing. BmDnmt1 and BmDeaf1 influenced the BmCHSA-2b transcription by binding competitively to the CpG island<disease> in the promoter. All the data together demonstrate that the cooperation between the down-regulation of BmDnmt1 and increased stage-specific expression of BmDeaf1 enhances BmCHSA-2b tissue- and stage-specific transcription to ensure mid-wing development in B. mori. This study highlights an elaborate regulation mechanism how tissue- and stage-specific gene expression is regulated through promoter methylation in insect development.
