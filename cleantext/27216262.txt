  A new mental health disorder , prolonged grief disorder ( PGD) , will be included in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD-11). We provide a brief overview of the historical conceptualizations of disordered grief and the previous research efforts to assess and define this condition. We describe the new ICD-11 PGD symptom criteria and how they are conceptualized in terms of the World Health Organization 's call for improved clinical utility. Finally , we review the research evidence for the clinical utility of the new ICD-11 PGD symptom structure and usability in the international arena.
