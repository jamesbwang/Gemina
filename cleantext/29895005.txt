  Lentigo maligna ( LM) is a rare form of in situ melanoma , frequently seen as a large patch in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to assess clinical and dermoscopic features of LM. A retrospective study of LM patients presenting to our center between July 2007 and July 2017 was performed. Demographic data , anatomical location , laterality , diameter , Clark level , Breslow stage , `` ABCD '' signs and dermoscopic features were registered. Facial versus extrafacial LM were compared. We found 21 LM , of which 12 had an extrafacial location and 9 a facial location. Half of the extrafacial lesions<symptom> were located on an upper limb. The median age at diagnosis was 63 years ( ranging from 38 to 84 years). Most LM cases were female ( 16/21) with phototype II ( 13/21). More than half of the patients ( 11/21) had a history of a skin neoplasm or actinic keratosis. The median diameter found was 6 mm ( interquartile range = 4.5 mm) , ranging from 1 to 15 mm. Five lesions<symptom> were invasive ( median Breslow depth of 0.2 mm) , and 4 of them were extrafacial. In this study LM was more frequently found in an extrafacial location and as a small patch with a 6-mm diameter medium. The epidemiology of LM/LM melanoma might be changing. Full body examination and dermoscopy are of the utmost importance for the diagnosis. Dermatologists should be aware and search for small lesions<symptom> outside the face and neck , particularly in middle-aged female patients with photo-damaged skin.
