  Detection of nucleic acids by innate immune sensors triggers the production of type I interferons ( IFNs). While IFNs are essential for host defense against viral<disease> infection<disease> , dysregulated production of IFNs underlies numerous autoinflammatory diseases. We have found that the loss of sumoylation results in a potent , spontaneous IFN response. Vertebrates possess three small ubiquitin-like modifiers ( SUMOs) that can be conjugated onto target proteins and alter protein function in diverse but still poorly characterized ways. We demonstrate that regulation of IFN by sumoylation is redundantly mediated by both SUMO2 and SUMO3 , but not SUMO1 , revealing a previously unknown function of SUMO2/3. Remarkably , this IFN response is independent of all known IFN-inducing pathways and does not require either of the canonical IFN-associated transcription factors IRF3 or IRF7. Taken together , our findings demonstrate that SUMO2 and SUMO3 are specific and essential negative regulators of a noncanonical mechanism of IFN induction.
