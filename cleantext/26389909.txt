  Most surveillance systems only contain CCTVs. CCTVs , however , provide only limited maneuverability against dynamic targets and are inefficient for short term surveillance. Such limitations do not raise much concern in some cases , but for the scenario in which traditional surveillance systems do not suffice , adopting a fleet of UAVs can help overcoming the limitations. In this paper , we present a surveillance system implemented with a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs). A surveillance system implemented with a fleet of UAVs is easy to deploy and maintain. A UAV fleet requires little time to deploy and set up , and removing the surveillance is also virtually instant. The system we propose deploys UAVs to the target area for installation and perform surveillance operations. The camera mounted UAVs act as surveillance probes , the server provides overall control of the surveillance system , and the fleet platform provides fleet-wise control of the UAVs. In the proposed system , the UAVs establish a network and enable multi-hop communication , which allows the system to widen its coverage area. The operator of the system can control the fleet of UAVs via the fleet platform and receive surveillance information gathered by the UAVs. The proposed system is described in detail along with the algorithm for effective placement of the UAVs. The prototype of the system is presented , and the experiment carried out shows that the system can successfully perform surveillance over an area set by the system.
