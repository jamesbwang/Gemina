  Metallic nanoparticles , such as gold and silver nanoparticles , can self-assemble into highly ordered arrays known as supercrystals for potential applications in areas such as optics , electronics , and sensor platforms. Here we report the formation of self-assembled 3D faceted gold nanoparticle supercrystals with controlled nanoparticle packing and unique facet-dependent optical property by using a binary solvent diffusion method. The nanoparticle packing structures from specific facets of the supercrystals are characterized by small/wide-angle X-ray scattering for detailed reconstruction of nanoparticle translation and shape orientation from mesometric to atomic levels within the supercrystals. We discover that the binary diffusion results in hexagonal close packed supercrystals whose size and quality are determined by initial nanoparticle concentration and diffusion speed. The supercrystal solids display unique facet-dependent surface plasmonic and surface-enhanced Raman characteristics. The ease of the growth of large supercrystal solids facilitates essential correlation between structure and property of nanoparticle solids for practical integrations.
