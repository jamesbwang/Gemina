  We present the development and evaluation of a gel liner system for upper limb prosthesis users that enables acquisition of electromyographic ( myoelectric) control signals through embedded electrodes and flexible , conductive fabric leads. This liner system is constructed using a manufacturing approach rather than by modifying a commercially available liner. To evaluate the efficacy , eight male individuals with transhumeral amputations used this system , with standard myoelectric prostheses , for home trials lasting an average of 7.3 weeks. Before and after the home trials , electrical resistance of the cumulative 218 embedded electrodes and leads within 10 gel liner systems was measured and found to increase slightly ( from an average of 13.4 to 27.5 Î©) after usage. While this increase was statistically significant ( p = 0.001) , all but one of the final resistance values remained low enough to enable consistent myoelectric control. User impressions were evaluated through a questionnaire comparing the liner prototypes to their own myoelectric prosthesis socket interface. Subjects preferred the liner prototype ( p = 0.008) over their own system in the clinical areas of comfort , suspension , function , and , especially , ease of use. These results suggest that this gel liner system is a clinically viable option and that it may offer advantages over current clinical technology for users of upper limb myoelectric prostheses.
