  Dietary vitamins and minerals are essential compounds for the proper functioning of metabolic enzymes , regulation of gene transcription , and powering the body & rsquo; s defense against oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate micronutrient consumption separately by age and sex , major dietary sources , and percentage of individuals meeting the recommended requirements according to Italian ( Livelli di Assunzione di Riferimento di Nutrienti ( LARN)) and European ( European Food Safety Agency ( EFSA)) agencies. Data were obtained from the Mediterranean Healthy Eating , Ageing , and Lifestyle ( MEAL) study , which included a sample of 1838 individuals randomly collected in the city of Catania , southern Italy. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to collect information on diet. Intake of vitamin A , vitamin C , and vitamin B group ( except vitamin B9) was in line with other reports and was adequate according to the guidelines , while the percentage of individuals meeting the guidelines for vitamin D , vitamin E , and vitamin B9 was about 3 % , 10 % , and 40 % , respectively. Among minerals , intake of iron , magnesium , and selenium was adequate for most of the sample , while the percentage of individuals meeting the recommendations for calcium , sodium , and potassium intake was about 20 % , 8 % , and 35 % , respectively. An important percentage of the population would benefit from campaigns raising awareness of micronutrient deficiency or excessive consumption potentially affecting their health.
