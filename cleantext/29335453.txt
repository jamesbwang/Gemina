  Yarrowia<pathogen> lipolytica<pathogen> is an oleaginous saccharomycetous yeast with a long history of industrial use. It aroused interest several decades ago as host for heterologous protein production. Thanks to the development of numerous molecular and genetic tools , Y.<pathogen> lipolytica<pathogen> is now a recognized system for expressing heterologous genes and secreting the corresponding proteins of interest. As genomic and transcriptomic tools increased our basic knowledge on this yeast , we can now envision engineering its metabolic pathways for use as whole-cell factory in various bioconversion processes. Y.<pathogen> lipolytica<pathogen> is currently being developed as a workhorse for biotechnology , notably for single-cell oil production and upgrading of industrial wastes into valuable products. As it becomes more and more difficult to keep up with an ever-increasing literature on Y.<pathogen> lipolytica<pathogen> engineering technology , this article aims to provide basic and actualized knowledge on this research area. The most useful reviews on Y.<pathogen> lipolytica<pathogen> biology , use , and safety will be evoked , together with a resume of the engineering tools available in this yeast. This mini-review will then focus on recently developed tools and engineering strategies , with a particular emphasis on promoter tuning , metabolic pathways assembly , and genome editing technologies.
