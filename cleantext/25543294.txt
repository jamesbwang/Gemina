  Lack of engagement with healthcare stakeholders results in missed opportunities to understand translation of evidence into practice. Stakeholder engagement is a key component of the Comparing Outcomes of Drugs and Appendectomy ( CODA) Study , a pragmatic clinical trial funded by PCORI to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotics versus urgent appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis<disease> We provide a framework for developing a stakeholder coordinating center ( SCC) and describe two examples of how stakeholder engagement can inform study development. Coordinating engagement activities through the SCC established a commitment to the important partnership with stakeholders. It also facilitated communication and provided a central mechanism for obtaining input on key decisions such as development of patient-centered consent documents and appropriate stopping rules for a specific sub-population of patients with appendicitis<disease> Translatable lessons include thoughtful planning for engagement , identifying stakeholders with a direct interest in the study conduct and findings , and integration of input received into the decisions that drive the conduct of the study. Standards for conducting patient-centered research should address the ability to successfully engage patients by demonstrating the capacity to recruit study participants , engage them over the duration of the study , and disseminate findings that are congruent with stakeholder needs. The process of sharing important clinical research findings has improved patient care , and we believe that dissemination of novel engagement strategies can lead to increased success in study design and execution.
