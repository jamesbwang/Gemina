  To determine the intrapartum and perinatal results associated with different degrees of staining of meconium stained amniotic fluid ( MSAF). In a retrospective cohort study of all singleton deliveries over a period of one year ( 2015) in a tertiary hospital , we compared different degrees of MSAF ( yellow , green and thick) to clear amniotic fluids , and analysed in each group maternal , intrapartum and neonatal variables as well as umbilical cord blood gas analysis. Of the 3590 deliveries included , 503 ( 14 %) had MSAF. The incidence of MSAF rises with gestational age at delivery , reaching 20.7 % in gestations above 41 weeks compared to 4.3 % below 37 weeks. As the amniotic fluid staining progresses we found a higher proportion of intrapartum fevers<symptom> ( p < 0.001) , pathological fetal heart rate patterns ( p < 0.05) , operative vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections ( p < 0.001) , as well as the need for advanced neonatal resuscitation ( p < 0.001). There was also a correlation between MSAF and low Apgar scores at five minutes ( p < 0.001) and fetal-neonatal mortality ( p < 0.001) but there was not a higher proportion of neonatal intensive care admissions ( p > 0.05). We have observed a similar distribution of umbilical artery pH ranges in all groups ( p > 0.05). MSAF was associated with an increase in the rate of pathological fetal heart rate patterns , intrapartum fevers<symptom> , operative vaginal and cesarean section deliveries , need for neonatal resuscitation , low Apgar scores and higher fetal-neonatal mortality. Moreover , we found that the risks increase as the staining and consistency of the amniotic fluid evolves so it should alert the obstetrician and paediatrician to the potential adverse outcomes.
