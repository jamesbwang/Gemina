  Mitophagy is an important type of selective autophagy for specific elimination of damaged mitochondria. PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1 ( PINK1)- catalyzed phosphorylation of ubiquitin ( Ub) plays a critical role in the onset of PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN)- long ( PTEN-L) is a newly identified isoform of PTEN , with addition of 173 amino acids to its N-terminus. Here we report that PTEN-L is a novel negative regulator of mitophagy via its protein phosphatase activity against phosphorylated ubiquitin. We found that PTEN-L localizes at the outer mitochondrial membrane ( OMM) and overexpression of PTEN-L inhibits , whereas deletion of PTEN-L promotes , mitophagy induced by various mitochondria-damaging agents. Mechanistically , PTEN-L is capable of effectively preventing Parkin mitochondrial translocation , reducing Parkin phosphorylation , maintaining its closed inactive conformation , and inhibiting its E3 ligase activity. More importantly , PTEN-L reduces the level of phosphorylated ubiquitin ( pSer65-Ub) in vivo , and in vitro phosphatase assay confirms that PTEN-L dephosphorylates pSer65-Ub via its protein phosphatase activity , independently of its lipid phosphatase function. Taken together , our findings demonstrate a novel function of PTEN-L as a protein phosphatase for ubiquitin , which counteracts PINK1-mediated ubiquitin phosphorylation leading to blockage of the feedforward mechanisms in mitophagy induction and eventual suppression of mitophagy. Thus , understanding this novel function of PTEN-L provides a key missing piece in the molecular puzzle controlling mitophagy , a critical process in many important human<disease> diseases<disease> including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson 's disease.
