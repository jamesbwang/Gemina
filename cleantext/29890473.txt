  Nitrogen ( N) and phosphorus ( P) flows from land to sea in the Yangtze River basin were simulated for the period 1900-2010 , by combining models for hydrology , nutrient input to surface water , and an in-stream retention. This study reveals that the basin-wide nutrient budget , delivery to surface water , and in-stream retention increased during this period. Since 2004 , the Three Gorges Reservoir has contributed 5 % and 7 % of N and P basin-wide retention , respectively. With the dramatic rise in nutrient delivery , even this additional retention was insufficient to prevent an increase of riverine export from 337 Gg N yr
