  This guideline reviews the evidence relating to the potential benefits of the vaginal hysterectomy ( VH) and supracervical hysterectomy ( SCH) versus total abdominal hysterectomy ( TAH) with respect to postoperative sexual function , urinary function , and peri- and postoperative complications. Laparoscopic options are not included in this guideline. Women considering hysterectomy for benign disease can be given the option of retaining the cervix or proceeding with a total hysterectomy. The outcomes measured are postoperative sexual function and urinary function , and peri- and postoperative complications. The Cochrane Library , Medline , and Embase were searched for articles published in English from January 1950 to March 2008 specifically comparing VH and SCH with TAH in the prevention of sexual dysfunction , urinary dysfunction , and peri- and postoperative complications. Results were restricted to systematic reviews , randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials , and observational studies. Additional publications were identified from the bibliographies of these articles. Randomized controlled trials were considered evidence of the highest quality , followed by cohort studies. Grey ( unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies , clinical practice guideline collections , clinical trial registries , and national and international medical specialty societies. The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care ( Table). None
