  Extended lymph node dissection ( ELND) compared to limited lymph node dissection ( LLND) at time of prostatectomy improves staging and lymph node ( LN) yield. The effect on biochemical recurrence ( BCR) and survival is less well understood. We sought to evaluate the benefit of robotic ELND and LLND with respect to BCR. Between 2008-2012 , 584 consecutive men with intermediate or high risk clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent robotic assisted radical prostatectomy ( RARP) with concomitant LLND ( n = 326) or ELND ( n = 258). Survival estimates were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank statistic was used for comparison of curves. BCR predictors were determined with multivariable Cox regression analysis. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare discrete and continuous variables , respectively , across the two groups. Median follow up for ELND and LLND patients was 46 and 54 months , respectively. ELND yielded more LNs ( 20 versus 6 , p < 0.0001) and had higher node positivity ( 15.1 % versus 3.4 % , p < 0.0001). BCR free survival ( BCRFS) at 3 and 5 years for ELND and LLND was 85 % and 75 % ( p = 0.01) , and 76 % and 67 % ( p = 0.10) , respectively. In subgroup analysis , ELND was associated with higher 5 year BCRFS in node-negative patients ( 84 % versus 68 % , p = 0.0005) and in intermediate risk patients ( 93 % versus 80 % , p = 0.0002). In multivariable analysis , ELND was a significant predictor of BCRFS in node-negative ( HR = 0.50 , p = 0.003) and intermediate risk patients ( HR = 0.54 , p = 0.03). ELND improves LN yield and detection of positive nodes. BCR analysis suggests a reduced risk of PSA failure for robotic ELND in intermediate risk and node-negative patients.
