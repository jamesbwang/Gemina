  Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy. Given their mechanism of action , immune-related adverse events have been associated with their use. We present the first documented case of pembrolizumab-induced grade IV neutropenia. A 73-year-old women known for myositis , Crohn 's disease , and hypothyroidism and diagnosed with PD-L1 positive stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma is treated with Pembrolizumab. She develops grade IV neutropenia 2 weeks after her second infusion. She is therefore hospitalized and treated initially with corticosteroids , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor , and intravenous immunoglobulins. Given the persistent neutropenia , cyclosporine was added , but quickly stopped owing to fever<disease> The patient recovered her neutrophils 6.5 weeks after her initial Pembrolizumab infusion and 12 days after admission. She has been subsequently successfully tapered off steroids with no recurrence after 3 months of follow-up. This is the first case of grade IV neutropenia secondary to Pembrolizumab. This case is of particular interest given the patient 's pre-existing autoimmune history. Treatment of severe neutropenia due to other PD1 inhibitors has generally consisted of steroids , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor , intravenous immunoglobulins , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclosporine A , and anti-thymocyte globulins- though the benefits of immunosuppression are not clear and may be harmful given the infectious risks. Large studies are required to clarify the spectrum and optimal management of immune-related adverse events and overall risk/benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with pre-existing autoimmunity.
