  To analyze treatment and survival in a series of resected patients with primary or recurrent retroperitoneal sarcoma<disease> ( RPS) treated and prospectively followed at a single institution. Between July 1994 and December 2015 , 89 patients ( 36 M , 53 F; mean age 60 years , range 25-79) were evaluated. For the purpose of analysis , complete resection was defined as removal of gross tumor with histologically confirmed clear resection margins. Eighty-three out of the 89 patients ( 93 %) , 46 of whom affected by primary RPS , and 37 by recurrent RPS , underwent surgical exploration. Sixty-two had a grossly and microscopically complete resection. Fifty-three out of 83 patients ( 64 %) underwent removal of contiguous intra-abdominal organs. Preoperative mortality was nil and significant preoperative complications occurred in six cases only ( 7 %). High-grade tumor pointed out to be a significant variable for a worse survival in all 83 patients amenable to undergo surgical resection ( 57 % 5 years survival for low grade vs 14 % for high grade;
