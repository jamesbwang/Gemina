  Over the last two decades , many exciting variable selection methods have been developed for finding a small group of covariates that are associated with the response from a large pool. Can the discoveries by such data mining approaches be spurious due to high dimensionality and limited sample size? Can our fundamental assumptions on exogeneity of covariates needed for such variable selection be validated with the data? To answer these questions , we need to derive the distributions of the maximum spurious correlations given certain number of predictors , namely , the distribution of the correlation of a response variable
