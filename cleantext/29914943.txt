  Robust population pharmacokinetic ( PK) data for fluconazole are scarce. The variability of fluconazole penetration into the CNS is not known. A fluconazole PK study was conducted in 43 patients receiving oral fluconazole ( usually 800 mg q24h) in combination with amphotericin B deoxycholate ( 1 mg/kg q24h) for cryptococcal meningitis<disease> ( CM). A 4-compartment PK model was developed and Monte Carlo simulations performed for a range of fluconazole dosages. A meta-analysis of trials reporting outcomes of CM patients treated with fluconazole monotherapy was performed. Adjusted for bioavailability , the PK parameter means ( standard deviation) were: clearance , 0.72 ( 0.24) litres/hour; volume of the central compartment , 18.07 ( 6.31) litres; volume of central nervous system ( CNS) compartment , 32.07 ( 17.60) litres; first-order rate constant from central to peripheral compartment , 12.20 ( 11.17) hours
