  The aim of this study was to compare the wear resistance of cast gold with condensable bulk fill and a fiber reinforced bulk-fill composite. The 5 mm Ã— 4 mm stainless steel molds were prepared for wear resistance. Forty-five samples were divided into three groups ( n = 15). The samples were restored as follows: Group I: cast gold alloy ( d. SIGN 98; Ivoclar Vivadent) , Group II: fiber reinforced composite ( Ever X Posterio; r GC Corp.) , and Group III: condensable bulk-fill composite ( Tetric N Ceram; Ivoclar Vivadent). A pin on disc wear tester was used to measure the wear resistance. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Higher statistically significant values were seen for the cast gold restorations than the other two bulk-fill composites. It is desirable for any restorative material to yield wear behavior. D. SIGN 98 ( Type IV cast gold alloy) was the most wear resistant material tested , whereas Tetric N Ceram ( condensable bulk-fill composite) was the least wear resistant.
