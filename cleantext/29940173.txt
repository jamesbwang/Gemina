  The ` neurotrophic sesquiterpenes ' refer to a group of molecules derived from the Illicium genus of flowering plant. They display neurotrophic effects in cultured neuron preparations and have been suggested to be cognitive enhancers and potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders and dementias. Recent synthetic advances generated sufficient quantities of jiadifenolide for in vivo investigation into its biological effects. Jiadifenolide did not induce convulsions<symptom> in mice nor did it enhance or diminish convulsions<symptom> induced by pentylenetetrazole. Other negative allosteric modulators of GABA
