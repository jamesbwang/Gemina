  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of single-port laparoscopic multivisceral resection ( S-MVR) for locally advanced left colon cancer. S-MVR is a challenging technique and to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of S-MVR for left colon cancer invading or adhering to neighboring organs. A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent laparoscopic multivisceral resection for locally advanced left colon cancer invading or adhering to neighboring organs from January 2008 to December 2014. Short-term and long-term outcomes were analyzed between groups of patients who underwent S-MVR and multi-port laparoscopic multivisceral resection ( M-MVR) retrospectively. A total of 14 patients underwent S-MVR and 15 patients underwent M-MVR. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of operative factors and postoperative complications. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the S-MVR group compared with the M-MVR group ( P = 0.048). Three-year overall survival was 61.9 % in the S-MVR group ( n = 14). In patients with stage II ( P = 0.600) and III ( P = 0714) disease the three-year overall and disease-free survival was 81.8 and 58.3 % in the S-MVR group and 80.0 and 70 % in the M-MVR groups over a median follow-up of 34 months. In conclusion , S-MVR for locally advanced left colon cancer is safe and feasible in selected patients.
