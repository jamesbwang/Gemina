  An efficient way to reduce the power consumption of electronic devices is to lower the supply voltage , but this voltage is restricted by the thermionic limit of subthreshold swing ( SS) , 60 millivolts per decade , in field-effect transistors ( FETs). We show that a graphene Dirac source ( DS) with a much narrower electron density distribution around the Fermi level than that of conventional FETs can lower SS. A DS-FET with a carbon nanotube channel provided an average SS of 40 millivolts per decade over four decades of current at room temperature and high device current
