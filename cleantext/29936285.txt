  Exposure to green space seems to be beneficial for self-reported mental health. In this study we used an objective health indicator , namely antidepressant prescription rates. Current studies rely exclusively upon mean regression models assuming linear associations. It is , however , plausible that the presence of green space is non-linearly related with different quantiles of the outcome antidepressant prescription rates. These restrictions may contribute to inconsistent findings. Our aim was: a) to assess antidepressant prescription rates in relation to green space , and b) to analyze how the relationship varies non-linearly across different quantiles of antidepressant prescription rates. We used cross-sectional data for the year 2014 at a municipality level in the Netherlands. Ecological Bayesian geoadditive quantile regressions were fitted for the 15 % , 50 % , and 85 % quantiles to estimate green space-prescription rate correlations , controlling for physical activity levels , socio-demographics , urbanicity , etc.. RESULTS: The results suggested that green space was overall inversely and non-linearly associated with antidepressant prescription rates. More important , the associations differed across the quantiles , although the variation was modest. Significant non-linearities were apparent: The associations were slightly positive in the lower quantile and strongly negative in the upper one. Our findings imply that an increased availability of green space within a municipality may contribute to a reduction in the number of antidepressant prescriptions dispensed. Green<symptom> space is thus a central health and community asset , whilst a minimum level of 28 % needs to be established for health gains. The highest effectiveness occurred at a municipality surface percentage higher than 79 %. This inverse dose-dependent relation has important implications for setting future community-level health and planning policies.
