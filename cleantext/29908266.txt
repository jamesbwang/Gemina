  The 21st century paradigm in toxicology , which emphasizes mechanistic understanding and species-relevant modeling of human biology and pathophysiology , is gaining traction in the wider biosciences through a global workshop series organized by the BioMed21 Collaboration. The second of this series , entitled Emerging Technology Toward Pathway-Based Human Brain Research , was held in Brazil in 2017 , bringing together leading South American and international scientists , research funders and other stakeholders. The aims were to foster strategic scientific dialogue and identify actionable consensus recommendations as a first step toward a roadmap for 21st century , human-specific health research and funding in the region.
