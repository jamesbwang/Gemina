  Early impaired response to social partners ' distress may negatively impact subsequent social development. Identifying factors contributing to successful responding may inform assessment and intervention. This study explores how: ( 1) social impairment , and ( 2) partner familiarity relate to response to partners ' distress. Infants with and without older siblings with ASD were assessed at 12 ( n = 29) and 15 ( n = 35) months for social impairment markers , and responses to mother and experimenter each feigning distress. Infants with more social impairment showed less attention and affect at 15 , but not 12 months. Infants attended more to the unfamiliar person , but exhibited greater affect toward the familiar person at 12 months. Results revealed social impairment and familiarity were separately related to infant response to partners ' distress.
