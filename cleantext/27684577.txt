  High-content image acquisition is generally limited to cells grown in culture , requiring complex hardware and preset imaging modalities. Here we report an open source software package , OpenHiCAMM ( Open Hi Content Acquisition for Î¼Manager) , that provides a flexible framework for integration of generic microscope-associated robotics and image processing with sequential work-flows. As an example , we imaged
