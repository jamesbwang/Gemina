  The same range of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> values may reflect different vascular functions , especially in the elderly. Therefore , a single blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> value may not comprehensively reveal cardiovascular function. This study focused on identifying pulse wave features in the elderly that can be used to show functional differences when blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> values are in the same range. First , pulse data were preprocessed and pulse cycles were segmented. Second , time domain , higher-order statistics , and energy features of wavelet packet decomposition coefficients were extracted. Finally , useful pulse wave features were evaluated using a feature selection and classifier design. A total of 6,075 pulse wave cycles were grouped into 3 types according to different blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> levels and each group was divided into 2 categories according to a history of hypertension. The classification accuracy of feature selection in the 3 groups was 97.91 % , 95.24 % , and 92.28 % , respectively. Selected features could be appropriately used to analyze cardiovascular function in the elderly and can serve as the basis for research on a cardiovascular risk assessment model based on Traditional Chinese Medicine pulse diagnosis.
