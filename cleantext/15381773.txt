  Human osteosarcoma ( OS) is one of the most common primary bone sarcoma<disease> , because of early metastasis and few treatment strategies. It has been reported that the tumorigenicity and self-renewal capacity of side population ( SP) cells play roles in human OS via regulating of target genes. This study aims to complement the differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) that regulated between the SP cells and the non-SP cells from primary human OS and identify their functions and molecular pathways associated with OS. The gene expression profile GSE63390 was downloaded , and bioinformatics analysis was made. One hundred forty-one DEGs totally were identified. Among them , 72 DEGs ( 51.06 %) were overexpressed , and the remaining 69 DEGs ( 48.94 %) were underexpressed. Gene ontology ( GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of target genes were performed. We furthermore identified some relevant core genes using gene-gene interaction network analysis such as EIF4E , FAU , HSPD1 , IL-6 , and KISS1 , which may have a relationship with the development process of OS. We also discovered that EIF4E/mTOR signaling pathway could be a potential research target for therapy and tumorigenesis of OS. This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the roles of DEGs coming from SP cells in the development of OS. However , these predictions need further experimental validation in future studies.
