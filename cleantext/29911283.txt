  In the Pacific Northwest of the USA , winter and spring temperature vary with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation , making effects of anthropogenic warming difficult to detect. We sought to detect community-level signals of anthropogenic change in a legacy plant phenology dataset. We analyzed both incomplete data from 1959 to 2016 on spring phenology of 115 species and more complete 1996-2016 data on spring and fall events for 607 plant species. We used ordination of the long-term dataset to identify two major axes of community-level change in phenology among years , with the first being a trend toward earlier spring phenology in more recent years. In contrast , for the short-term dataset , variation in spring phenology was mostly PDO-driven and did not reveal a strong trend over time. At both time scales , a second axis of phenological variation reflected summer and fall events , especially earlier appearance of fall color in recent years. In univariate analysis , more than 80 % of individual species ' leaf out dates and first flower dates occurred earlier over time , for an average advance across all species of 2.5 days per decade from 1959 to 2016. While most events did not advance in the period 1996-2016 , fall color advanced by 10.6 days per decade , suggesting that intensification of summer drought has continued regardless of the PDO cycle. While estimates of slope over time depended strongly on the time window chosen for the analysis , estimates of slope versus temperature were consistently negative regardless of time window , averaging 5-7 days per 1 Â°C for spring events.
