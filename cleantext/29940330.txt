  As an environmental endocrine disruptor , Di- ( 2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP) affects blood-testis barrier ( BTB)- associated proteins expression , which compromises BTB integrity and causes infertility<symptom>. Notably , DEHP-induced testicular toxicity is related to oxidative stress , but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Therefore , we sought to investigate this mechanism and determine whether vitamin C and vitamin E administration would attenuate the BTB impairment induced by DEHP in vivo and by Mono- ( 2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate ( MEHP) in vitro , respectively. HE staining and EM found that DEHP exposure led to spermatogenesis dysfunction and BTB disruption , respectively. The Western blot and immunofluorescence results showed that DEHP exposure caused BTB impairment through oxidative stress-mediated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signaling pathway. Furthermore , Vitamin E and vitamin C could alleviate the oxidative stress , block DEHP-induced spermatogenesis dysfunction and BTB disruption by inhibiting p38 MAPK signaling pathway. In summary , vitamin E and vitamin C are good candidates for the treatment of DEHP-induced male
