  The purpose of the present paper is to review the origin and development of the epidemiology of mesothelioma in Italy , starting with the detection and investigation of the major outbreak of the disease observed in Casale Monferrato , Piedmont Region. Over the last four decades , mortality among the cohort of ex-Eternit workers has been measured at three points in time. More recently , population based case-control studies in the area of Casale Monferrato have provided new light on the dose-response curve of the relationship between asbestos exposure and mesotheliomas. The publication of the first Casale Monferrato study had a major impact in the country and contributed to the decision of the Italian Parliament to ban the use of asbestos. The experience of Casale Monferrato represents a lesson in several terms , from the epidemiological surveillance to the health care of the victims and the relationship between epidemiologists , victims , their relatives and residents in contaminated areas.
