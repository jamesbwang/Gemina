  A rich body of literature has established the role of body image distortion and dissatisfaction in the development and maintenance of eating disorders. However , many of the currently used techniques require explicit comparison of the person 's body<symptom> to an external stimulus. As the body schema is a largely unconscious construct , explicit comparison tasks may reflect a proxy , rather than the body schema itself. Here we use an implicit mental motor imagery ( MMI) task to interrogate the body schema in healthy control participants ( N = 40) and participants at a residential eating disorder treatment center ( N = 42). By comparing the time it takes to imagine making a movement along a part of the body<symptom> to the time it takes to actually make the same movement , we were able to assess participants ' mental image of their body ( i.e. , body schema). We found that participants with eating disorders , but not healthy controls , exhibited distortions of the body schema such that they believed their abdomen , buttocks , and thighs to be larger than they really are. Additionally , the MMI task used here provided information above and beyond traditional self-report measures ( i.e. , Body Shape Questionnaire). Together the MMI task and traditional measures provide the most information. Findings using the novel MMI task are in line with the literature; participants with eating disorders consider themselves to be larger than they truly are. Taken together , results of this study suggest that MMI tasks provide complementary information to traditional self-report measures. ( JINS , 2018 , 22 , 000-000).
