  Two hexaarylbenzenes having six pyridine substituents ( LH and LM) were prepared and six corresponding coordination complexes with copper ( i) chloride were synthesized. Monomeric complexes ( 1 , 2a and 2b) and 1D coordination polymers ( 3 , 4 and 5) were synthesized via the judicious concentration control of copper ( i) ions and characterized fully by X-ray crystal analysis. The binding modes of the ligands to copper ( i) ions in the coordination polymers were dependent on steric effects and solvents to determine the morphology of the coordination polymers. More interestingly , dynamic behaviours of the monomeric complexes ( 1 , 2a and 2b) in the solution phase were studied to show potential applications of molecular machines with fluxional motions.
