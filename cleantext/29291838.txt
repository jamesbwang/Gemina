  Pinocembrin is a natural flavonoid compound which is capable of antioxidant , antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , and antineoplastic activities. The present study aimed to enhance the solubility and antioxidant activities of pinocembrin by complex formation with lecithin. The physicochemical characteristics of pinocembrin ⁻ lecithin complex were analyzed by ultraviolet ( UV) , fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) , and solubility assay , and the antioxidant activities of pinocembrin ⁻ lecithin complex were evaluated via radical scavenging capacities for 2,2 & prime;- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH) , 2,2 & prime;- azino-bis ( 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) ( ABTS) , hydroxyl , and superoxide-anion. The results indicated that pinocembrin complex with lecithin could significantly improve the solubility of pinocembrin in water and
