  This study aimed to determine whether intrauterine placement of a novel composite material ( copper ( Cu) microparticles , low-density polyethylene , and methyl vinyl silicone rubber ( Cu/LDPE/MVQ)) could prevent pregnancy in rabbits , and to evaluate the effects of Cu/LDPE/MVQ on the endometrial environment. Eighty sexually mature female rabbits were randomly divided into four groups ( n = 20 each group): control ( sham-operated) , LDPE/MVQ , Cu/LDPE/MVQ microcomposite , and bare Cu. Ten rabbits from each implant-bearing group were randomly selected for a mating experiment beginning 30 days after insertion. Pregnancy outcomes were observed 15 days after mating. Factors associated with endometrial bleeding and inflammation<symptom> in the remaining rabbits in each group , and the surface conditions of the implants , were investigated 90 days post-insertion. The Cu ( 0 embryo) and Cu/LDPE/MVQ ( 0 embryo) groups had significantly fewer embryos than the LDPE/MVQ ( 1.0 ± 0.6 embryos , p < .05) and sham-operated groups ( 4.1 ± 1.3 embryos , p < .05). Compared with bare Cu , the Cu/LDPE/MVQ composite material was associated with considerable reductions in injuries and factors associated with abnormal endometrial bleeding and inflammation<symptom> , such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9) and prostaglandin E2 ( PGE This novel Cu-containing intrauterine device material exhibits a similar effect in prevention of pregnancy with bare copper , and lower levels of inflammatory markers. This study demonstrates the potential of the novel Cu/LDPE/MVQ microcomposite material as a future substitute for conventional intrauterine device materials.
