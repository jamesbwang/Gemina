  In the last decade , there has been a rapid increase in the dissemination of automated external defibrillators ( AEDs) for prehospital defibrillation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. The aim of this study was to study the association between different defibrillation strategies on survival rates over time in Copenhagen , Stockholm , Western Sweden and Amsterdam , and the hypothesis was that non-EMS defibrillation increased over time and was associated with increased survival. We performed a retrospective analysis of four prospectively collected cohorts of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 2008 and 2013. Emergency medical service ( EMS)- witnessed arrests were excluded. A total of 22453 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with known survival status were identified , of whom 2957 ( 13 %) survived at least 30 days postresuscitation. Of all survivors with a known defibrillation status , 2289 ( 81 %) were defibrillated , 1349 ( 59 %) were defibrillated by EMS , 454 ( 20 %) were defibrillated by a first responder AED and 429 ( 19 %) were defibrillated by an onsite AED and 57 ( 2 %) were unknown. The percentage of survivors defibrillated by first responder AEDs ( from 13 % in 2008 to 26 % in 2013 , p < 0.001 for trend) and onsite AEDs ( from 14 % in 2008 to 30 % in 2013 , p < 0.001 for trend) increased. The increased use of these non-EMS AEDs was associated with the increase in survival rate of patients with a shockable initial rhythm. Survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are increasingly defibrillated by non-EMS AEDs. This increase is primarily due to a large increase in the use of onsite AEDs as well as an increase in first-responder defibrillation over time. Non-EMS defibrillation accounted for at least part of the increase in survival rate of patients with a shockable initial rhythm.
