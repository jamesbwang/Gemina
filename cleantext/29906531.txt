  Ischemic stroke ( IS) is a complex and devastating vascular disease that has become one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Several studies have shown the association between matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) family gene polymorphisms and IS. However , the results have been indecisive. To investigate the association between Matrix Metalloproteinase gene polymorphisms and risk of IS. A literature search for eligible candidate gene studies published before , 28 June 2017 , was conducted in the PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane and Google Scholar databases. The following combinations of main keywords were used: ( ` Matrix Metalloproteinase ' or ` MMP ' or ` Stromelysin-1 ' or ` Gelatinase b ') AND ( ` ischemic stroke ' or ` IS ') AND ( ` single nucleotide polymorphism ' or ` gene polymorphism ' or ` SNP '). Fixed or random effects models were used to estimate the Pooled Odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI). Statistical analysis was carried out by using STATA version 13.0 software. Total 29 studies were included in our meta-analysis. A significant association was observed for MMP-9 ( -1562 C/T) ( OR 1.27; 95 % CI 1.06 to 1.53; p value = 0.01) and MMP-12 ( -1082 A/G) ( OR 2.55; 95 % CI 1.75 to 3.71; p value < 0.001) gene polymorphisms and risk of IS. No significant association was found for any of the MMP-1 ( -1607 1G/2G) , MMP-2 ( -1306 C/T) & ( -735 C/T) and MMP-3 ( -1612 5A/6A) gene polymorphisms with the risk of IS. Our meta-analysis suggests that MMP-9 ( -1562 C/T) and MMP-12 ( -1082 A/G) gene polymorphisms could be a risk factor for IS while MMP-1 ( -1607 1G/2G) , MMP-2 ( -1306 C/T) & ( -735 C/T) and MMP-3 ( -1612 5A/6A) have no association with the risk of causing IS. However , large prospective studies with sufficient power are required to validate our findings.
