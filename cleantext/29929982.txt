  The liver is the main site of estrogen metabolism , and liver disease is usually associated with an abnormal estrogen status. However , little is known about the mechanism underlying this connection. Here , we investigated the effects of bile acid ( BA)- activated Farnesoid X receptor ( FXR) on the metabolism of 17β-estradiol ( E2) during blockage of bile flow ( cholestasis). Correlations between BA levels and E2 concentrations were established in patients with cholestasis , and hepatic expression profiles of key genes involved in estrogen metabolism were investigated in both WT and FXR-/- mice. We found that the elevated E2 level positively correlated with BA concentrations in the patients with cholestasis. We further observed that bile duct ligation ( BDL) increases E2 levels in mouse serum , and this elevation effect was alleviated by deleting the FXR gene. Of note , FXR down-regulated the expression of hepatic sulfotransferase SULT1E1 , the primary enzyme responsible for metabolic estrogen inactivation. At the molecular level , we found that FXR competes with the protein acetylase CREB-binding protein ( CBP) for binding to the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α ( HNF4α). This competition decreased HNF4α acetylation and nuclear retention , which , in turn , repressed HNF4α-dependent SULT1E1 gene transcription. These findings suggest that cholestasis induces BA-activated FXR activity , leading to downstream inhibition of SULT1E1 and hence impeding hepatic degradation of estrogen.
