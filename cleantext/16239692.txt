  Despite a multitude of studies , etiology of primary chronic telogen effluvium ( TE) remains incompletely understood. Essential heavy metals are associated with beneficial effects in humans as well as in other living organisms. However , they may lead to toxic effects when the exposure exceeds the higher tolerable limits. We wanted to assess the heavy metal and trace element levels in patients with chronic TE. A total of 40 subjects with chronic TE were included in the study , and 30 healthy women served as control. General and dermatological examinations were taken up in all individuals. Those patients with positive hair pull test were evaluated with the help of a trichogram. The presence of > 20 % telogen hair as documented by trichogram was a requirement for the study inclusion. UNICAM-929 spectrophotometry device was used for determining serum trace element and heavy metal concentrations. In spite of an absence of significant differences in terms of average Zn concentration , weight , or height between patients and controls , significant differences were noted for Cd , Fe , Mg , Mn , Pb , Co , and Cu ( Our results suggest that heavy metals may play a causative role in the development of chronic TE. However , contrary to previous reports , zinc did not appear to play an important etiological role , while these patients had elevated serum iron levels.
