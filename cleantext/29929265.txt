  Birds are considered a good model for indicators of biodiversity response to habitat variations , as they are very sensitive to environmental change. However , continuous observations of habitat alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones , as well as the associated effects on bird biodiversity , are lacking. In this study , New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai , China was selected to illustrate the response of bird species , and thus biodiversity , to habitat loss and fragmentation. Land use/land cover ( LULC) data and bird records from 2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that , due to urban sprawl , the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4 % and 87.3 % by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity , species richness and relative abundance were calculated , and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting , the mean species abundance ( MSA) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation , and its value decreased from 100 % to 76.8 % to 52.2 % to 24.5 % in the four corresponding stages. Finally , suggested by redundant analysis , the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities , and the area and connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables. Our findings could provide important information to inform bird biodiversity protection and habitat restoration.
