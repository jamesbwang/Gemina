  Malignant plasma cell proliferation may present as a disseminated disease ( multiple myeloma) , a solitary plasmacytoma of bone , or an extramedullary plasmacytoma of soft tissue. The latter plasmacytomas represent approximately 3 % of all plasma cell proliferations , and 80 % develop in the head-and-neck region. The unexpected clinical presentation of such masses may be present. Here , we report a rare case of primary tonsillar plasmacytoma in a 42-year-old female. The patient presented with asymmetric tonsillar hypertrophy that was resistant to antibiotherapy. Upon further workup , we found no evidence of multiple myeloma or light-chain disease. The patient underwent surgery and , at the last follow-up , exhibited no evidence of such disease. In adults presenting with asymptomatic tonsillar enlargement , the possibility of submucosal masses should be considered , thus encouraging the radiologist to evaluate crypts within the palatine tonsil on a postcontrast MRI , besides enlargement and signal change.
