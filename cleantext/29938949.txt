  This study aimed to investigate biomechanical properties of synthetic implants for reconstructive surgery of pelvic floor dysfunction. In this dissertation , we chose four synthetic implants , i.e. total pelvic floor repair system ( PROLIFT) , gynecone TVT obtutator system ( TVT-O) , intra-vaginal sling placement device ( IVS) and acellular dermal matrix ( Renov) , for tensile test respectively. The biomechanical properties of four synthetic implants were measured and analyzed using a material testing machine ( Instron 4302 versatile material testing machine). The biomechanical parameters included ultimate stress strength , modulus of elasticity , maximum load and maximum elongation. The results showed that the maximum load of the four symthetic implants was TVT-O > IVS > PROLIFT > Renov , and the maximum load of TVT-O was significantly higher than PROLIFT and Renov (
