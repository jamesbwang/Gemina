  Zinc transporters facilitate metal mobilization and compartmentalization , playing a key role in cellular development. Little is known about the mechanisms and pathways of Zn movement between Zn transporters and metalloproteins during myoblast differentiation. We analyzed the differential expression of ZIP and ZnT transporters during C2C12 myoblast differentiation. Zn transporters account for a transient decrease of intracellular Zn upon myogenesis induction followed by a gradual increase of Zn in myotubes. Considering the subcellular localization and function of each of the Zn transporters , our findings indicate that a fine regulation is necessary to maintain correct metal concentrations in the cytosol and subcellular compartments to avoid toxicity , maintain homeostasis , and for loading metalloproteins needed during myogenesis. This study advances our basic understanding of the complex Zn transport network during muscle differentiation.
