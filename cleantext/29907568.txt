  ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolase 3 ( ARH3) plays important roles in regulation of poly ( ADP-ribosy) lation , a reversible post-translational modification , and in maintenance of genomic integrity. ARH3 degrades poly ( ADP-ribose) to protect cells from poly ( ADP-ribose)- dependent cell death , reverses serine-mono ( ADP-ribosy) lation , and hydrolyzes
