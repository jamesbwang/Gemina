  Osteoarthritis ( OA) is a highly prevalent disease , which is associated with extracellular matrix degradation and cell death in articular cartilage. The aim of the present study was to identify whether tetrahydrohyperforin ( IDN5706) ameliorates the degeneration of articular cartilage and affects autophagy in OA. The rat model of experimental OA was induced by intra-articular injection of collagenase solution. IDN5706 was administered intragastrically to rats for 6 weeks. Histopathological changes in articular cartilage were examined using hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E) and safranin O staining , and Mankin scoring systems. The effect of IDN5706 on autophagy was examined using western blotting. ELISA was performed to detect cartilage inflammation<symptom>. H&E and safranin O staining , Mankin scores , and electron microscopy indicated that IDN5706 could lessen the degeneration of articular cartilage in OA rats. In addition , western blotting revealed that IDN5706 treatment may activate the suppressed autophagy in OA rats. In conclusion , the present study demonstrated that IDN5706 was able to reduce the severity of experimental OA , alleviate the degeneration of articular cartilage , and affect autophagy in OA model rats.
