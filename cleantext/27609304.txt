  The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium is generating null allele mice for every protein-coding gene in the genome and characterizing these mice to identify gene-phenotype associations. While CRISPR/Cas9-mediated null allele production in mice is highly efficient , generation of conditional alleles has proven to be more difficult. To test the feasibility of using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate conditional knockout mice for this large-scale resource , we employed Cas9-initiated homology-driven repair ( HDR) with short and long single stranded oligodeoxynucleotides ( ssODNs and lssDNAs). Using pairs of single guide RNAs and short ssODNs to introduce loxP sites around a critical exon or exons , we obtained putative conditional allele founder mice , harboring both loxP sites , for 23 out of 30 targeted genes. LoxP sites integrated in cis in at least one mouse for 18 of 23 genes. However , loxP sites were mutagenized in 4 of the 18 in cis lines. HDR efficiency correlated with Cas9 cutting efficiency but was minimally influenced by ssODN homology arm symmetry. By contrast , using pairs of guides and single lssDNAs to introduce loxP-flanked exons , conditional allele founders were generated for all four genes targeted , although one founder was found to harbor undesired mutations within the lssDNA sequence interval. Importantly , when employing either ssODNs or lssDNAs , random integration events were detected. Our studies demonstrate that Cas9-mediated HDR with pairs of ssODNs can generate conditional null alleles at many loci , but reveal inefficiencies when applied at scale. In contrast , lssDNAs are amenable to high-throughput production of conditional alleles when they can be employed. Regardless of the single-stranded donor utilized , it is essential to screen for sequence errors at sites of HDR and random insertion of donor sequences into the genome.
