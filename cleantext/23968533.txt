  In South-East Asia , the maternal and child mortality rate has declined over the past decades; however , it varies among and within the countries in the region , including Cambodia. The continuum of care is an integrated series of care that women and children are required to avail continuously from pregnancy to the child/motherhood period. This study aimed to assess the completion rate of the continuum of care and examine the factors associated with the continuum of care in Ratanakiri , Cambodia. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ratanakiri. Overall , 377 women were included , and data were collected via face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Among them , 5.0 % completed the continuum of care ( antenatal care at least four times , delivery by skilled birth attendant , and postnatal care at least once). Meanwhile , 18.8 % did not receive any care during pregnancy , delivery , and after birth. The highest discontinuation rate was at the postnatal care stage ( 73.6 %). Not receiving any perinatal care was associated with neonatal complications at 6 weeks after birth ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR): 3.075; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.310-7.215). Furthermore , a long distance to the health center was negatively associated with completion of the continuum of care ( AOR: 0.877; 95 % CI: 0.791-0.972). This study indicates the need for efforts to reduce the number of women who discontinue from the continuum of care , as well as who do not receive any care to avoid neonatal complications. Since the discontinuation rate was highest at the postnatal care , postnatal care needs to be promoted more through the antenatal care and delivery services. Furthermore , given that long distance to health facilities was a barrier for receiving the care continuously , our findings suggest the need for a village-based health care system that can provide the basic continuum of care in remote areas.
