  To test for the feasibility of transabdominal Doppler sonography ( color , power , pulse wave) to define uterine perfusion characteristics throughout the estrous cycle in gilts. A total of 15 gilts were synchronized for estrus and scanned in their following spontaneous cycle while being restrained in a purpose-designed mobile crate. To define uterine perfusion characteristics , vessels in between and within uterine cross-sections were imaged and recorded as video sequences to be analyzed by PixelFlux Â® software for perfused area ( Amix) , blood flow velocity ( vmix) and intensity ( Imix) as well as resistance ( RIvmix) and pulsatility index ( PIvmix). Color Doppler sonography proved to be the only feasible technique , as it was less affected by animal movements than power and pulse wave sonography. As determined by color Doppler sonography , all five parameters determined showed specific patterns through the estrous cycle , i. e. Amix , vmix , Imix were high in proestrus , decreased in estrus and remained low in midestrus and most parts of diestrus; RIvmix and PIvmix with inversely paralleled patterns. This study has demonstrated that transabdominal color Doppler but not power and pulse wave Doppler sonography is feasible to be performed in crate-restrained gilts for studying uterine perfusion characteristics during the estrous cycle , and that changes of uterine perfusion over the course of the estrous cycle can be clearly followed by color Doppler sonography. Results encourage the use of color Doppler sonography for studying i. e. uterine capacity or uterus related infertility<symptom> such as for cases of clinically unapparent
