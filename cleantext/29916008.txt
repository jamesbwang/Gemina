  A meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials accrued from 1964 to 1986 demonstrated significantly higher rates of locoregional failure ( LRF) and breast-cancer mortality in women with 1-3 positive nodes without postmastectomy radiotherapy ( PMRT) after mastectomy ( mast.). Recent data demonstrate that PMRT reduces distant metastases ( DM) in women with pN1 disease. The challenge today is whether all patients with pathologic T1-2pN1 disease have similar substantial LRF/DM risk that routinely warrants PMRT. We reviewed patients with pT1-2N1 breast cancer treated with mast. Â± adjuvant systemic therapy without PMRT from 2000 to 2013. The endpoints were LRF and DM rates , estimated by cumulative incidence method. We identified 468 patients with median follow-up of 6.3 years. Most ( 71 %) were estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor + human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2). There were 269 patients with 1 + node , 140 patients with 2 + nodes , and 59 patients with 3 + nodes. The 6-year LRF/DM rates were 4.1 %/ 8.4 %. Patients with 1 + , 2 + , and 3 + nodes had 6-year LRF of 2.3 , 5.1 and 8.9 % , respectively ( p = 0.13). The 6-year DM rate was higher in patients with 3 + nodes versus 1-2 + nodes: 15.7 % versus 7.4 % ( p = 0.02). Several subgroups had low 6-year LRF and DM rates , including T1/1 + node ( 0.8 %/ 4.1 % LRF/DM) and micrometastases ( 0 %/ 5.8 % LRF/DM). Patients with pT1-2pN1 represent a heterogeneous group with a wide range of LRF/DM rates. In particular , patients with pT1 tumors and 1 + LN , and patients with micrometastases , had low event rates. These groups would derive small absolute reductions in LRF and DM with addition of PMRT , underscoring the importance of patient selection for PMRT in pT1-2pN1 breast cancer.
