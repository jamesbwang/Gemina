  T-type calcium channels ( T-channels) are critical for regulating neuronal excitability. Estrogen could alter neuronal excitability by modulating the expression of T-channels. The lateral habenula ( LHb) as a link between the limbic system and midbrain structures expresses T-channels and estrogen receptors. However , little is known about the role of estrogen in modulating T-channels in the LHb. In this study , we investigated the distribution of T-channels in three LHb subregions ( rostral , middle and caudal) in normal female rats. Next , we analyzed the influence of 17Î²-estradiol ( E2) on T-channels in the LHb in ovariectomized ( OVX) rats ( oil- and E2-groups) using whole-cell patch clamp recording and real-time PCR. In normal rats , the results showed that the peak of T-type calcium current ( I
