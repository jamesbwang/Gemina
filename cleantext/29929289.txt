  The Three-River Source Region ( TRSR) of the Tibetan Plateau ( TP) is regarded as the `` Chinese water tower ''. Climate warming and the associated degradation of permafrost might change the water cycle and affect the alpine vegetation growth in the TRSR. However , the quantitative changes in the water budget and their impacts on the vegetation in the TRSR are poorly understood. In this study , the spatial-temporal changes in the hydrological variables and the normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI) during 2003-2014 were investigated using multiple satellite data and a remote sensing energy balance<symptom> model. The results indicated that precipitation showed an increasing trend at a rate of 14.0 mm 10 a
