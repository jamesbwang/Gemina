  To determine whether supplemental oxygen in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) impacts on procedure-related and clinical outcomes. The DETermination of the role of Oxygen in suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction ( DETO2X-AMI) trial randomized patients with suspected myocardial infarction ( MI) to receive oxygen at 6 L/min for 6-12 h or ambient air. In this pre-specified analysis , we included only STEMI patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). In total , 2807 patients were included , 1361 assigned to receive oxygen , and 1446 assigned to ambient air. The pre-specified primary composite endpoint of all-cause death , rehospitalization with MI , cardiogenic shock<symptom> , or stent thrombosis at 1 year occurred in 6.3 % ( 86 of 1361) of patients allocated to oxygen compared to 7.5 % ( 108 of 1446) allocated to ambient air ( hazard ratio ( HR) 0.85 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) 0.64-1.13; P = 0.27). There was no difference in the rate of death from any cause ( HR 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.61-1.22; P = 0.41) , rate of rehospitalization for MI ( HR 0.92 , 95 % CI 0.57-1.48; P = 0.73) , rehospitalization for cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( HR 1.05 , 95 % CI 0.21-5.22; P = 0.95) , or stent thrombosis ( HR 1.27 , 95 % CI 0.46-3.51; P = 0.64). The primary composite endpoint was consistent across all subgroups , as well as at different time points , such as during hospital stay , at 30 days and the total duration of follow-up up to 1356 days. Routine use of supplemental oxygen in normoxemic patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI did not significantly affect 1-year all-cause death , rehospitalization with MI , cardiogenic shock<symptom> , or stent thrombosis.
