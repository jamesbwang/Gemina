  Percutaneous fixation of the acetabulum is a treatment option for select acetabular fractures. Intra-operative fluoroscopy is required , and despite various described imaging strategies , it is debatable as to which combination of fluoroscopic views provides the most accurate and reliable assessment of screw position. Using five synthetic pelvic models , an experimental setup was created in which the anterior acetabular columns were instrumented with screws in five distinct trajectories. Five fluoroscopic images were obtained of each model ( Pelvic Inlet , Obturator Oblique , Iliac Oblique , Obturator Oblique/Outlet , and Iliac Oblique/Outlet). The images were presented to 32 pelvic and acetabular orthopaedic surgeons , who were asked to draw two conclusions regarding screw position: ( 1) whether the screw was intra-articular and ( 2) whether the screw was intraosseous in its distal course through the bony corridor. In the assessment of screw position relative to the hip<symptom> joint , accuracy of surgeon 's response ranged from 52 % ( iliac oblique/outlet) to 88 % ( obturator oblique) , with surgeon confidence in the interpretation ranging from 60 % ( pelvic inlet) to 93 % ( obturator oblique) ( P < 0.0001). In the assessment of intraosseous position of the screw , accuracy of surgeon 's response ranged from 40 % ( obturator oblique/outlet) to 79 % ( iliac oblique/outlet) , with surgeon confidence in the interpretation ranging from 66 % ( iliac oblique) to 88 % ( pelvic inlet) ( P < 0.0001). The obturator oblique and obturator oblique/outlet views afforded the most accurate and reliable assessment of penetration into the hip<symptom> joint , and intraosseous position of the screw was most accurately assessed with pelvic inlet and iliac oblique/outlet views.
