  To diagnose coeliac disease ( CD) in individuals on a gluten free diet ( GFD) , we aimed to assess the utility of detecting activated γδ and CD8 T cells expressing gut-homing receptors after a short gluten challenge. We studied 15 CD patients and 35 non-CD controls , all exposed to three days of gluten when following a GFD. Peripheral blood was collected before and six days after starting gluten consumption , and the expression of CD103 , β7 and CD38 in γδ and CD8 T cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Determination of IFN-γ and IP-10 was performed by means of ELISPOT and/or Luminex technology. We observed both γδ and CD8 T cells coexpressing CD103 , β7 A short three-day gluten challenge elicits the activation of CD103
