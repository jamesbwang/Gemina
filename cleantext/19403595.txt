  Laparoscopic bariatric surgeries in morbid obese patients may be associated with atelectasis , hypercapnia , and hypoxemia<symptom> , intra and postoperatively. Several strategies are used for the prevention of these consequences. This study aimed to examine the effects of three different recruitment maneuvers comparatively during surgery and the influence of the maneuvers on some cardiopulmonary indices. In a clinical trial , ninety participants of laparoscopic surgery with body mass index higher than 40 were randomly divided into three equal groups. The first group was subject to 10 cmH The average of peak airway pressure , plateau airway pressure , and SpO Multiple deep breaths alone are not as effective as PEEP or PEEP plus MDB in preventing adverse pulmonary effects in laparoscopic bariatric surgeries of morbid obese patients.
