  A dumbbell-shaped magnetic stir-bar with sublimate sorbent was prepared for the stir bar sorptive extraction ( SBSE) of pesticides in an aqueous sample prior to gas chromatography-micro-electron capture detection ( GC-μECD). Cyclododecane ( CDD) was coated onto a magnetic stir-bar surface as a sublimate sorbent , and steel balls were placed on both ends to form a dumbbell-shaped magnetic stir-bar for SBSE. Four EDC pesticides including chlorpyrifos , ethion , bromopropylate , and λ-cyhalothrin in aqueous samples were selected as model species to examine the proposed SBSE and the following desorption. The parameters studied were those affecting the extraction efficiencies including the coating ( solvent for CDD and thickness) , extraction ( sample pH , stirring rate , time , and salting out effect) , dissolution solvent volume , and the loss of CDD sublimated in air. The maximum extraction efficiency was obtained under the following conditions. The stir bar ( with CDD thickness of 5.2 μm) was added into a 10 mL sample solution ( at pH 7) for a 20-min extraction at 600 rpm. Then , the stir bar was gently removed from the sample solution , disassembled , and immersed into a 0.2 mL insert tube consisting of 3 μL hexane to dissolve; 1 μL was used for GC-ECD analysis. The linear ranges were 0.005-5 μg L
