  Mixed-solvent molecular dynamics ( MixMD) is a cosolvent simulation technique for identifying binding hotspots and specific favorable interactions on a protein 's surface. MixMD studies have the ability to identify these biologically relevant sites by examining the occupancy of the cosolvent over the course of the simulation. However , previous MixMD analysis required a great deal of manual inspection to identify relevant sites. To address this limitation , we have developed MixMD Probeview as a plugin for the freely available , open-source version of the molecular visualization program PyMOL. MixMD Probeview incorporates two analysis procedures: ( 1) identifying and ranking whole binding sites and ( 2) identifying and ranking local maxima for each probe type. These functionalities were validated using four common benchmark proteins , including two with both active and allosteric sites. In addition , three different cosolvent procedures were compared to examine the impact of including more than one cosolvent in the simulations. For all systems tested , MixMD Probeview successfully identified known active and allosteric sites based on the total occupancy of neutral probe molecules. As an easy-to-use PyMOL plugin , we expect that MixMD Probeview will facilitate identification and analysis of binding sites from cosolvent simulations performed on a wide range of systems.
