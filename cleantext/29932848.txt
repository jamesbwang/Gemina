  Technological advances in solid organ tissue engineering that rely on the assembly of small tissue-building parts require a novel transport method suited for soft , deformable , living objects of submillimeter- to centimeter-length scale. We describe a technology that utilizes membrane flow through a gripper to generate optimized pressure differentials across the top and bottom surfaces of microtissue so that the part may be gripped and lifted. The flow and geometry parameters are developed for automation by analyzing the fluid mechanics framework by which a gripper can lift tissue parts off solid and porous surfaces. For the axisymmetric part and gripper geometries , we examine the lift force on the part as a function of various parameters related to the gripper design , its operation , and the tissue parts and environments with which it operates. We believe our bio-gripping model can be used in various applications in high-throughput tissue engineering.
