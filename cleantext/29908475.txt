  Seeking help from others is an essential behavioural intention for humans to adapt to the social environment. Transgenerational and gender-related mechanisms of how this intention is shaped is an important but unresolved question in adolescent development. This study aimed to comprehensively examine the factors promoting or inhibiting intention to seek help for depression<symptom> in 10-year-olds , including transgenerational factors , and to investigate the sex differences in the effect of these factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a community of 4478 10-year-old children and their parents using self-report questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. The dependent variable was intention of seeking help for depression<symptom> , which was assessed using a depression<symptom> case vignette. Independent variables were demographic , psychological , and transgenerational/social factors including depressive symptoms , psychotic-like symptoms , tendency to help classmates , and parents ' help-seeking intention. Girls were more likely to seek help than boys. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that factors promoting help-seeking intention included the recognition of a need for help , emotional openness , tendency to help classmates , parents ' positive intention of seeking help for depression<symptom> , and the number of people to consult. The inhibiting factors included depressive symptoms , psychotic-like symptoms , and gender norms regarding problem solving. Gender norms inhibited intention of seeking help for depression<symptom> more strongly in boys than in girls. Parents ' and children 's help-seeking intention were correlated to each other. Actions should be considered against gender norms presuming that boys should solve their own problems. Further , these actions should target adults as much as adolescents.
