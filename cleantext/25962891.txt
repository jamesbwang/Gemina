  Web-based lifestyle interventions at the workplace have the potential to promote health and work productivity. However , the sustainability of effects is often small , which could be enhanced by adding face-to-face contacts , so-called ` blended care '. Therefore , this study evaluates the effects of a blended workplace health promotion intervention on health and work outcomes among employees with increased cardiovascular risk. In this multicentre cluster-randomised controlled trial ( PerfectFit) , 491 workers in 18 work units from military , police , and a hospital with increased cardiovascular risk were randomised into two intervention groups. The limited intervention ( n = 213; 9 clusters) consisted of a web-based Health Risk Assessment with advice. In the extensive intervention ( n = 271; 8 clusters) , coaching sessions by occupational health physicians using motivational interviewing were added. One cluster dropped out after randomisation but before any inclusion of subjects. Primary outcome was self-rated health. Secondary outcomes were body<symptom> weight , body mass index ( BMI) , work productivity , and health behaviours. Follow-up measurements were collected at 6 and 12 months. Effect sizes were determined in mixed effects models. At 12 months , the extensive intervention was not statistically different from the limited intervention for self-rated health ( 4.3 %; 95 % CI -5.3-12.8) , BMI (- 0.81; 95 % CI -1.87-0.26) and body<symptom> weight (- 2.16; 95 % CI -5.49-1.17). The within-group analysis showed that in the extensive intervention group body<symptom> weight (- 3.1 kg; 95 % CI -2.0 to- 4.3) was statistically significantly reduced , whereas body<symptom> weight remained stable in the limited intervention group ( + 0.2 kg; 95 % CI -1.4 to 1.8). In both randomised groups productivity loss and physical activity increased and excessive alcohol use decreased significantly at 12 months. There were no effects on self-rated health , body<symptom> weight , and BMI. However , within the group with web-based tailored Health Risk Assessment including personalized advice body<symptom> weight reduced significantly. Adding motivational coaching is promising to reduce body<symptom> weight. Retrospectively registered at the Netherlands Trial Registry with number NTR4894 , at Nov 14 2014.
