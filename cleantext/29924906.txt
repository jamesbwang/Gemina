  An analytical method based on liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry has been developed for the simultaneous determination of six aminoglycoside antibiotics in honey. The sample pretreatment included extraction with aqueous trichloroacetic acid followed by solid-phase extraction on Strata-X polymeric reversed phase cartridges. Liquid chromatography separation was performed on an Obelisc R zwitterionic type mixed-mode column. An ionBooster â„¢ heated electrospray source was used and showed enhanced ionization efficiency in comparison to a conventional electrospray source. The observed signal enhancement ranged from 3- ( neomycin) to 16-fold ( gentamicin C1). A data-dependent mass spectrometry acquisition approach was employed , in which the full mass spectrometry dataset provided quantification and a scheduled precursor list was used to trigger an alternating data-dependent acquisition of MS
