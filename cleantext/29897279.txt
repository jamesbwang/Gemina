  Health care workers have high rates of musculoskeletal injuries , but many of these injuries go unreported to workers ' compensation and national surveillance systems. Little is known regarding the work-related injuries of certified athletic trainers ( ATs). To determine the 12-month incidence and prevalence of work-related injuries and describe injury-reporting and- management strategies. Cross-sectional study. Population-based online survey. Of the 29 051 ATs currently certified by the Board of Certification , Inc , who `` opted in '' to research studies , we randomly selected 10 000. Of these , 1826 ( 18.3 %) ATs currently working in the clinical setting were eligible and participated in the baseline survey. An online survey was e-mailed in May of 2012. We assessed self-reported work-related injuries in the previous 12 months and management strategies including medical care , work limitations or modifications , and time off work. Statistics ( frequencies and percentages) were calculated to describe injury rates per 200 000 work hours , injury prevalence , injury characteristics , and injury-reporting and- management strategies. A total of 247 ATs reported 419 work-related injuries during the previous 12 months , for an incidence rate of 21.6 per 200 000 hours ( 95 % confidence interval = 19.6 , 23.7) and injury prevalence of 13.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 12.0 % , 15.1 %). The low back ( 26 %) , hand/fingers ( 9 %) , and knee ( 9 %) were frequently affected body sites. Injuries were most often caused by bodily motion/overexertion/repetition ( 52 %) , contact with objects/equipment/persons ( 24 %) , or slips/trips/falls ( 15 %). More than half of injured ATs ( 55.5 %) sought medical care , 25 % missed work , and most ( 77 %) did not file a workers ' compensation claim for their injury. Half of injured ATs were limited at work ( n = 125) , and 89 % modified or changed their athletic training work as a result of the injury. More than half of AT work-related injuries required medical care or work limitations and were not reported for workers ' compensation. Understanding how ATs care for and manage their work-related injuries is important given that few take time off work.
