  AA-type kidney amyloidosis is classically associated with chronic autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. However , some urban centers have reported a high prevalence of injection drug use among patients with kidney AA amyloidosis. Previous reports lack control groups to quantify associations and most predate the opioid epidemic in the United States. We conducted a case-control study of 38 patients with biopsy-confirmed kidney AA amyloidosis and 72 matched control individuals without this condition from two large hospital systems in Seattle , Washington. We ascertained the pattern and duration of heroin use by medical chart review and determined associations using logistic regression. Among case patients , 95 % had a prior history of heroin use , 87 % had skin<symptom> abscesses<symptom> , and 76 % and 27 % had evidence of muscling and skin popping , respectively. After adjustment for age , race , sex , site , and year of biopsy , any heroin use ( past or current) was associated with an estimated 170-times higher risk of kidney AA amyloidosis compared with no heroin use ( 95 % confidence interval , 28 to 1018 times higher; Injection heroin use is strongly associated with kidney AA amyloidosis in the Pacific Northwest. Unique aspects of heroin use , in particular geographic regions or frequent associated soft-tissue infections , may be an important cause of this progressive kidney disease.
