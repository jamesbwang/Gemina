  The platelet and megakaryocyte cytoskeletons are essential for formation and function of these cells. A dynamic , properly organised tubulin and actin cytoskeleton is critical for the development of the megakaryocyte and the extension of proplatelets. Tubulin in particular plays a pivotal role in the extension of these proplatelets and the release of platelets from them. Tubulin is further required for the maintenance of platelet size , and actin is the driving force for shape change , spreading and platelet contraction during platelet activation. Whilst several key proteins which regulate these cytoskeletons have been described in detail , the formin family of proteins has received less attention. Formins are intriguing as , although they were initially believed to simply be a nucleator of actin polymerisation , increasing evidence shows they are important regulators of the crosstalk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. In this review , we will introduce the formin proteins and consider the recent evidence that they play an important role in platelets and megakaryocytes in mediating both the actin and tubulin cytoskeletons.
