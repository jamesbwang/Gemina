  Atherosclerosis , an artery disease , is currently the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women. The first step in the development of atherosclerosis involves leukocyte adhesion to the arterial endothelium. It is broadly accepted that blood flow , more specifically wall shear stress ( WSS) , plays an important role in leukocyte capture and subsequent development of an atherosclerotic plaque. What is less known is how instantaneous WSS , which can vary by up to 5 Pa over one cardiac cycle , influences leukocyte capture. In this paper we use direct numerical simulations ( DNS) , performed using an in-house code , to illustrate that leukocyte capture is different whether as a function of instantaneous or time-averaged blood flow. Specifically , a stenotic plaque is modeled using a computational fluid dynamics ( CFD) solver through fully three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the immersed boundary method. Pulsatile triphasic inflow is used to simulate the cardiac cycle. The CFD is coupled with an agent-based leukocyte capture model to assess the impact of instantaneous hemodynamics on stenosis growth. The computed wall shear stress agrees well with the results obtained with a commercial software , as well as with theoretical results in the healthy region of the artery. The analysis emphasizes the importance of the instantaneous flow conditions in evaluating the leukocyte rate of capture. That is , the capture rate computed from mean flow field is generally underpredicted compared to the actual rate of capture. Thus , in order to obtain a reliable estimate , the flow unsteadiness during a cardiac cycle should be taken into account.
