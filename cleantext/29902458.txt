  Accumulating evidence has documented that microRNAs ( miRNAs) are critical regulators of neural stem cell ( NSC) proliferation and differentiation. MiRNA-374b ( miR-374b) has been reported to play an important role in regulating various cellular processes , such as proliferation and differentiation. However , whether miR-374b is involved in NSC proliferation and differentiation remains unclear. In this study , we investigated the potential role of miR-374b in regulating NSC proliferation and differentiation to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Our results showed that miR-374b expression was significantly upregulated during NSC differentiation. Functional experiments showed that overexpression of miR-374b promoted NSC proliferation and differentiation to neurons. By contrast , miR-374b inhibition showed the opposite effect. Hairy and enhancer of split 1 ( Hes1) , a master regulator of neurogenesis , was predicted as a potential target gene of miR-374b by bioinformatics analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-374b could directly target the 3 '- untranslated region of Hes1. Further experiments showed that miR-374b negatively regulated the mRNA and protein expression of Hes1 in NSCs. Moreover , overexpression of Hes1 significantly reversed the miR-374b overexpression-mediated effect on NSC proliferation and differentiation. In addition , knockdown of Hes1 abrogated the miR-374b inhibition-mediated effect on NSC proliferation and differentiation. Taken together , these results demonstrate that miR-374b regulates the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs through targeting Hes1 and suggest that miR-374b is a potential target for modulating NSC-mediated neurogenesis.
