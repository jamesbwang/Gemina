  To determine whether the 2011 FDA alert and French Guidelines have impacted the routine surgical practice in the management of pelvic organ prolapse in a `` vaginalist '' team over the period 2010-2015. Retrospective study involving all patients undergoing surgical management of anterior and/or apical symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse during the civil years 2010 and 2015. Both naive and relapsed prolapses were eligible. Overall , 338 patients were included: 187 in 2010 and 151 in 2015. Among patients with naive prolapse , we observed a significant increase in the number of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexies ( 11.1 % in 2010 versus 34.4 % in 2015 , P = 0.001) and a significant decline in the use of native tissue repair ( 67.6 % in 2010 versus 39 % in 2015 , P = 0.001). While the number of transvaginal meshes did not decline over the study period , their indications displayed a significant evolution towards a restricted use to advanced stages. We did not observe any difference regarding the treatment of recurred pelvic organ prolapse. Vaginal route remained the preferred approach in this indication. In our `` vaginalist '' team , routine practice has significantly evolved over the period 2010-2015 , resulting in a diversification of the healthcare offer. This paradigm shift towards pluripotency is mandatory , since patients ' preference should also drive the choice of both surgical route and technique.
