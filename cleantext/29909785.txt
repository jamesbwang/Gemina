  ABSTRACTIt is possible for individuals with a diagnosis of cancer to see the illness as an opportunity to change and to make certain decisions that could improve their chances of recovery. We aimed , through qualitative research , to understand the experience of cancer in older adults through new behaviors and habits , intentions to change and maintenance of old behaviors and habits in the context of the disease. Our participants were 10 people aged 60 to 73 with a diagnosis of cancer. The majority of participants expressed intentions to change or adopted new behaviors or habits. Relatives had very little influence on participant 's choices and participants did not seek information on cancer or ways to contribute to healing. However , they were very receptive to the recommendations made by physicians.
