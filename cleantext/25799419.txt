  Microorganisms in glacier ice provide tens to hundreds of thousands of years archive for a changing climate and microbial responses to it. Analyzing ancient ice is impeded by technical issues , including limited ice , low biomass , and contamination. While many approaches have been evaluated and advanced to remove contaminants on ice core surfaces , few studies leverage modern sequencing to establish
