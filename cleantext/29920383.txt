  A chemotherapeutic drug exerts favorable antitumor activity and simultaneously exhibits expectable inhibition on wound<disease> healing process. Phenanthroimidazole derivatives possess potent anticancer activity. However , only a few studies focused on the discovery of its potential effects on promoting tissue regeneration. In this study , four novel phenanthroimidazole derivatives were synthesized and characterized , and they exhibited evident inhibition on different tumor cells; compound 3 is the most active one. Moreover , 3 can promote wound<disease> healing of zebrafish in a dose-dependent manner. Further study demonstrated that 3 promoted the recruitment of inflammatory cells , formation of angiogenesis , and generation of reactive oxygen species and also influenced the motor behavior of zebrafish. Results indicated that 3 can accelerate the occurrence of pro-inflammation , angiogenesis , oxidative stress , and innervation , which play key roles in the facilitation of wound<disease> healing. Therefore , 3 can act as a bifunctional drug in inhibiting tumor and promoting tissue regeneration.
