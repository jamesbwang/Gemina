  With the worldwide epidemic of obesity , there has been an increase in the numbers of primary and revisional procedures of bariatric surgery such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGBP). Nevertheless , this type of surgery is not exempt from complications. An excessive length of non-functional Roux limb<symptom> proximal to the jejunojejunostomy can cause abnormal upper gastrointestinal symptoms after laparoscopic RYGBP. We present the case of a female patient who presented these unspecific abdominal<symptom> symptoms<symptom> after laparoscopic RYGBP who underwent laparoscopic resection in order to reduce the length of the dilated blind loop responsible for the symptoms.
