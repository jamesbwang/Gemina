  Diabetic foot ulceration ( DFU) is a common and serious complication among diabetic patients. A medical device has been developed to prevent the occurrence of DFU. The aim of this study was to investigate the willingness to pay ( WTP) for this device among the general public in the UK. A contingent valuation survey was administered to 1051 participants through an online survey including questions on socio-demographic characteristics , self-reported health , knowledge of diabetes and medical devices , and WTP. A two-part model was used to analyse determinants of WTP , including a logistic model in the first part and a generalised linear model with a log-transformed WTP in the second part. More than half ( 55.9 %) of the participants expressed a positive WTP. The annual mean ( standard deviation) and median ( interquartile range) WTP values were # 76.9 ( 69.1) and # 50 ( 80) , respectively. Older age , middle-level education , good/excellent self-reported health , visiting doctors once/2 -5 times , diabetes experience , medical device experience and more than average self-perceived likelihood of using similar devices were associated with a higher likelihood of willingness to pay. Younger age , male gender and higher household income were associated with higher WTP values. This study demonstrated that people are willing to pay for this device and they tend to contribute when they have experience of diabetes or similar devices and perceive self-benefit.
