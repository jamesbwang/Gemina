  Knowledge of genetic combining ability and gene action would help breeders to choose suitable parents and devise an appropriate breeding strategy for coriander. In the present study , six diverse genotypes of coriander , their 15 F1s and 15 F2s were evaluated through randomized complete block design with three replications to study genetic combining ability for agronomic and phytochemical traits in coriander. Plants were subjected to well-watered ( WW) , mild water-deficit stress ( MWDS) and severe water-deficit stress ( SWDS) irrigation regimes. The results indicate that water-deficit stress decreased all of the measured traits in both the F1 and F2 generations. General combining ability and specific combining ability effects were highly significant for all of the traits in both the F1 and F2 generations. Additive gene action was predominant for phonology and fruit yield component traits in all irrigation regimes in both the F1 and F2 generations. For fatty acid content and total lipid yield , non-additive gene action was predominant in the F1 generation while additive gene action was predominant in the F2 generation under MWDS and SWDS conditions. The P4 parent had the highest general combining ability for fruit yield components in both the F1 and F2 generations. The P6 parent had the highest general combining ability for phenological and phytochemical traits. The P4 and P6 parents are promising material to develop early flowering and early maturing genotypes coupled with high total lipids in advanced generations of segregation.
