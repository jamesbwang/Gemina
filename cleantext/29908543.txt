  A subset of CD4 + T cells named T helper ( Th) 22 cells play some pathogenic roles in some autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes ( T1D). We aimed to study the correlation between the circulatory number of these cells and serum levels of its related cytokines with T1D as well as diabetic complications including metabolic control , atherosclerosis , and nephropathy. Fortynine patients with T1D and 43 healthy controls underwent the assessment of circulatory number of Th22 cells ( by flow cytometry) , serum level of Th22 related cytokines including Interleukin-22 ( IL-22) , Interleukin-10 ( IL-10) , Transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) , Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) ( by ELISA) and carotid intima-media thickness ( cIMT) measurement ( by doppler ultrasonography). In addition , fasting blood and urine samples were taken to measure levels of hemoglobin A1C , lipid profile , cell blood count ( CBC) , serum and urine creatinine and urine protein in all participants. Th22 frequency and serum levels of IL-22 and TNF-α in patients were significantly higher than those in controls ( p < 0.001). Serum levels of IL-10 and TGF-β in healthy individuals were higher than those in patients ( p < 0.001). None of the Th22 related markers had a significant correlation with diabetic complications. There was only a significant effect of IL-22 on HbA1C variations. Th22 pathway has a significant correlation with T1D but not with its complications of cIMT and Urine Albumin/Creatinine Ratio ( UACR). We report that Th22 pathway is not a good prognostic as well as diagnostic marker of early macrovascular complications in T1D.
