  Diabetes in pregnancy ( DIP) is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Unfortunately guidelines and clinical practices vary significantly and a number of key issues remain under debate. These include: glucose cut-offs for diagnosis; the approaches of universal versus selective screening; appropriate timing of screening; and acceptability of various screening strategies to the population at risk. Economic considerations are also of importance , but unfortunately data outlining the best approach from this viewpoint are limited. In this paper , we review each of these topics and examine associated barriers and challenges associated with various strategies from a European perspective. We also address options which potentially may have a future role in the care of these women including alternative diagnostic biomarkers.
