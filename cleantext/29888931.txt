  Experienced workplace incivility has consistently been linked to a host of negative outcomes , but as a low-intensity behavior , most working adults should be able to adapt and move on from these experiences of incivility over time. On the basis of repeated measures data from a heterogeneous sample of 625 respondents across three waves , with a 1-month lag between assessments , and framed within adaptation theory , we propose and find strong empirical evidence that although incivility is concurrently related to 5 indices related to both positive and negative employee well-being ( i.e. , role overload , affective commitment , subjective well-being , burnout , and turnover intentions) , working adults adapt to these experiences over time. However , in considering the unfolding of incivility over time , we also make a meaningful contribution and extension to adaptation theory , a theory wherein little consideration has been given to stressors that may be recurring over time. We propose and test the repeated exposure hypothesis as a framework for conceptualizing how past ( distal) experiences of a stressor can indirectly influence strain outcomes via more proximal experiences of the stressor. We also provide preliminary evidence that indices of well-being have systematic lagged effects on incivility , supporting the argument for reverse causation over time between the constructs.
