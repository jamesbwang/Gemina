  Juvenile tegu lizards ( Salvator merianae) experience gradual and mild temperature changes from autumn to winter in their habitat. This tropical/subtropical reptile enter a state of dormancy , with an 80 % reduction in metabolic rate , that remains almost constant during winter. The redox metabolism in non-mammalian vertebrates that hibernate under such distinguished conditions is poorly understood. We analyzed the redox metabolism in the intestine of juvenile tegus during different stages of their first annual cycle. The effect of food deprivation ( in spring) was also studied to compare with fasting during hibernation. Both winter dormancy and food deprivation caused decreases in reduced glutathione levels and glutathione transferase activity. While glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase activities decreased during winter dormancy , as well as glutathione ( GSH) levels , other antioxidant enzymes ( catalase , superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase) remained unchanged. Notably , levels of disulfide glutathione ( GSSG) were 2.1-fold higher in late autumn , when animals were in the process of depressing metabolism towards hibernation. This increased `` oxidative tonus '' could be due to a disruption in NADPH-dependent antioxidant systems. In dormancy , GSSG and lipid hydroperoxides were diminished by 60-70 %. The results suggest that the entrance into hibernation is the main challenge for the redox homeostasis in the intestine of juvenile tegus.
