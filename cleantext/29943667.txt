  Brain aging is an intricate and natural phenomenon exclusively characterized by oxidative stress , accumulation of oxidatively damaged macromolecules , and alterations in structure and function of neurons that further increase the risk factor for most of the neurodegenerative diseases. In addition , age-dependent defective autophagy has also been implicated to favour the pathogenesis and prevalence of the neurological diseases. Therefore , the development of strategies that delay aging and the concomitant neurological disorders remain elusive. Thus , the present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of rapamycin-induced activation of autophagy on aging-related oxidative stress , cell death , neuro-inflammation and neurodegeneration in rat brain. Our data demonstrated the significant age-related oxidative stress , apoptotic cell death , elevated inflammatory response , and reduced level of markers associated with rejuvenation and neural integrity including the activities of ion channel transporters ( Na +/ K +- ATPase and Ca2 +- ATPase) and acetyl cholinesterase ( AChE) in the brain of old aged rats. Furthermore , rapamycin ( 0.5 mg/kg b.w. for 28 days) induced activation of autophagy provided significant protection to aging rat brain by reducing the aging-induced oxidative stress , apoptotic cell death , and markers of neurodegeneration. Thus , our data confirmed that autophagy plays a pivotal role in delaying brain aging plausibly by maintaining the cellular homeostasis , and structural and functional integrity of cells in the brain.
