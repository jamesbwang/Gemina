  Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. The magnitude of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> effects from sleep apnea treatment is unclear. We aimed to determine the effect of mandibular advancement device therapy on ambulatory nighttime and daytime blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in women and men with daytime sleepiness and snoring or mild to moderate sleep apnea ( apnea-hypopnea index , < 30). In this 4-month , double-blind , randomized controlled trial comprising 96 untreated patients , 27 women and 58 men , aged 31 to 70 years , completed the study. The active group received individually made adjustable mandibular advancement devices , and the control group was given individually made sham devices , to be used during sleep. Polysomnographic sleep recordings and ambulatory 24-hour blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measurements were performed at baseline and at follow-up. In women with mandibular advancement devices , the mean nighttime systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was 10.8 mm Hg ( 95 % confidence interval , 4.0-17.7 mm Hg; A mandibular advancement device for obstructive sleep apnea reduces nocturnal blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in women.
