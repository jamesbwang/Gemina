  Our previous study indicated that emergency contraception , including levonorgestrel and progesterone , could lead to ectopic pregnancy following contraception failure. However , our understanding of the effects of levonorgestrel and progesterone on oviductal physiology is limited. The receptivity of the fallopian tubal epithelium after levonorgestrel and progesterone treatment was examined through western blots for receptivity markers and JAr-spheroid-fallopian tubal epithelial cell attachment assays. The ciliary beat frequency was analyzed using an inverted bright-field microscope. Furthermore , an in vivo animal model of embryo-tubal transplantation was also studied to determine the effects of levonorgestrel- and progesterone-induced ciliary beat reduction. Our results showed that levonorgestrel and progesterone did not change the levels of fallopian tubal epithelial cell receptive markers , including LIF , STAT3 , IGFBP1 , ITGB3 , MUC1 , and ACVR1B , or affect JAr-spheroid implantation. However , levonorgestrel and progesterone reduced the ciliary beat frequency in fallopian tubes in a dose-dependent manner. An in vivo model also showed that levonorgestrel and progesterone could lead to embryo retention in the oviducts. These findings show that levonorgestrel and progesterone can reduce the ciliary beat frequency without altering receptivity , indicating a possible mechanism for progesterone- or levonorgestrel-induced tubal pregnancy.
