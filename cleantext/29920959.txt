  We employ optical coherence tomography ( OCT) and optical coherence microscopy ( OCM) to study conjunctival lymphatics in porcine eyes ex vivo. This study is a precursor to the development of in vivo imaging of the collecting lymphatics for potentially guiding and monitoring glaucoma filtration surgery. OCT scans at 1300 nm and higher-resolution OCM scans at 785 nm reveal the lymphatic vessels via their optical transparency. Equivalent signal characteristics are also observed from blood vessels largely free of blood ( and devoid of flow) in the ex vivo conjunctiva. In our lymphangiography , vessel networks were segmented by compensating the depth attenuation in the volumetric OCT/OCM signal , projecting the minimum intensity in two dimensions and thresholding to generate a three-dimensional vessel volume. Vessel segmentation from multiple locations of a range of porcine eyes ( n = 21) enables visualization of the vessel networks and indicates the varying spatial distribution of patent lymphatics. Such visualization provides a new tool to investigate conjunctival vessels in tissue ex vivo without need for histological tissue processing and a valuable reference on vessel morphology for the in vivo label-free imaging studies of lymphatics to follow.
