  The absence of osseous consolidation of a fracture for 9 or more months with no potential to heal is defined as nonunion. Both for the patient and from a socioeconomic point of view , nonunions represent a major problem. Hypertrophic , vital nonunions are distinguished from atrophic avital ones. Risk factors for a delayed fracture healing are insufficient immobilisation , poor adaptation of the fracture surfaces or residual instability , interposition of soft tissue within the fracture gap , as well as circulation disturbances and infections. The incidence of nonunions after fractures of the long bones lies between 2.6 and 16 % depending on the surgical technique used. In human and animal studies , a positive effect of parathyroid hormone ( PTH) on fracture healing has been shown. PTH has a direct stimulatory effect on osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In addition , it appears to influence the effect of osseous growth factors. In this prospective study , 32 patients with nonunions were treated with teriparatide to investigate the effects of PTH on fracture healing. Definitive healing of the nonunions following PTH treatment could be observed in 95 % of the cases.
