  Modifications in cellular RNAs have emerged as key regulators of all aspects of gene expression , including pre-mRNA splicing. During spliceosome assembly and function , the small nuclear RNAs ( snRNAs) form numerous dynamic RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions , which are required for spliceosome assembly , correct positioning of the spliceosome on substrate pre-mRNAs and catalysis. The human snRNAs contain several base methylations as well as a myriad of pseudouridines and 2 '- O-methylated nucleotides , which are largely introduced by small Cajal body-specific-RNPs. Modified nucleotides typically cluster in functionally important regions of the snRNAs , suggesting that their presence could optimise the interactions of snRNAs with each other or with pre-mRNAs , or may affect the binding of spliceosomal proteins. snRNA modifications appear to play important roles in snRNP biogenesis and spliceosome assembly , and have also been proposed to influence the efficiency and fidelity of pre-mRNAs splicing. Interestingly , alterations in the modification status of snRNAs have recently been observed in different cellular conditions , implying that some snRNA modifications are dynamic and raising the possibility that these modifications may fine-tune the spliceosome for particular functions. Here , we review the current knowledge on the snRNA modification machinery and discuss the timing , functions and dynamics of modifications in snRNAs.
