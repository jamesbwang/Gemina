  We present the case of a 10-year old patient from southeastern Ontario with severe bilateral facial palsy. MRI was performed that showed extensive symmetric enhancement of cervical cranial nerve roots and multiple<symptom> cranial<symptom> nerves ( III , V , VI , VII , VIII , X and XII). Lumbar puncture was performed that revealed pleocytosis and elevated proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid. Serology confirmed the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. The patient was treated with a 4-week course of IV ceftriaxone , following which he returned to baseline.
