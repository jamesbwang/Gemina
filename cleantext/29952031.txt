  The identification of prognostic factors in patients with glioblastoma multiforme<pathogen> ( GBM) represents an area of increasing interest. Carbonic anhydrase IX ( CA-IX) , a hypoxia marker , correlates with tumor progression in a variety of human cancers. However , the role of CA-IX in GBM remains largely unknown. In the present study , we evaluated the prognostic role of CA-IX in GBM patients. In total , 66 consecutive patients with GBM who received concomitant chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide were retrospectively reviewed , and all patients received temozolomide chemotherapy for at least 3 months. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used for analysis of progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) , and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was employed to identify factors with an independent effect on survival. The median OS was longer in patients with low levels of CA-IX expression ( 18 months) compared to patients overexpressing CA-IX ( 9 months) ( P = 0.004). There was not a statistically significant difference in median PFS ( 3.5 vs. 8 months , P = 0.054) between patients with high or low levels of CA-IX expression. In multivariate analysis , the variables that were identified as significant prognostic factors for OS were preoperative Karnofsky performance scale score ( KPS) ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 3.703; P = 0.001) , CA-IX overexpression ( HR , 1.967; P = 0.019) , and incomplete adjuvant temozolomide treatment ( HR , 2.241; P = 0.003) and gross-total resection ( HR , 1.956; P = 0.034). Our findings indicated that CA-IX may be a potential prognostic biomarker in the treatment of GBM.
