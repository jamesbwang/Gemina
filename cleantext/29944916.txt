  Cockayne Syndrome<disease> ( CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder , which leads to neurodegeneration , growth failure and premature aging. Most of the cases are due to mutations in the ERCC6 gene , which encodes the protein CSB. CSB is involved in several functions including DNA repair and transcription. Here we describe two Danish brothers with CS. Both patients carried a novel splice site mutation ( c. 2382 +2 T > G) , and a previously described nonsense mutation ( c. 3259C > T , p.Arg1087X) in a biallelic state. Both patients presented the cardinal features of the disease including microcephaly , congenital cataract and postnatal growth failure. In addition , their fibroblasts were hypersensitive to UV irradiation and exhibited increased superoxide levels in comparison to fibroblasts from healthy age and gender matched individuals. Metabolomic analysis revealed a distinctive metabolic profile in cells from the CS patients compared to control cells. Among others , Î±-ketoglutarate , hydroxyglutarate and certain amino acids ( ornithine<disease> , proline and glycine) were reduced in the CS patient fibroblasts , whereas glycolytic intermediates ( glucose-6-phosphate and pyruvic acid) and fatty acids ( palmitic , stearic and myristic acid) were increased. Our data not only provide additional information to the database of CS mutations , but also point towards targets for potential treatment of this devastating disease.
