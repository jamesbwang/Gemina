  To validate the preoperative ultrasound-based endometriosis staging system ( UBESS) for predicting the correct Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RANZCOG) and the Australasian Gynaecological Endoscopy and Surgery ( AGES) Society 's level of laparoscopic skill level required for endometriosis surgery. Multi-center retrospective cohort study ( Canadian Task Force II-2). A tertiary teaching hospital and a private gynecological clinic. 155 women presenting with chronic pelvic pain and/or a history of endometriosis. Women underwent detailed specialized transvaginal ultrasound ( TVS) in a tertiary referral unit to diagnose and stage endometriosis using the three stages of UBESS. The UBESS was correlated to RANZCOG/AGES laparoscopic skill levels. The UBESS classifications were correlated as such: UBESS I to predict RANZCOG/AGES surgical skill levels 1/2 , UBESS II to predict RANZCOG/AGES skill levels 3/4 and UBESS III to predict RANZCOG/AGES skill level 6. The accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values and positive and negative likelihood ratios of the UBESS I to predict the RANZCOG/AGES surgical skill levels 1/2 were: 99.4 % , 98.9 % , 100 % , 100 % , 98.5 % , inf and .011; those of UBESS II to predict surgical skill levels 3/4 were: 98.1 % , 96.8 % , 98.4 % , 93.8 % , 99.2 % , 60 and .033; and those for UBESS III to predict surgical skill level 6 were: 98.7 % , 97.2 % , 99.2 % , 97.2 % , 99.2 % , 115.7 and 0.028 , respectively. The rate of correctly predicting the exact level of skills needed was 98.1 % , and Cohen 's kappa statistic for the agreement between UBESS prediction and levels of training required at surgery is 0.97 , indicating almost perfect agreement. The UBESS can be utilized to predict the level of complexity of laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis based on the RANZCOG/AGES skills levels for laparoscopy. It now needs to be externally validated in multiple centers with various surgical skill level classification systems to assess the general applicability.
