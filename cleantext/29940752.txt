  YWHAZ ( 14-3-3Î¶) has been reported to be a prognostic marker for various tumors and play a crucial role in many oncogenic processes , including proliferation , migration and invasion. However , the functional role and mechanism of YWHAZ in gastric cancer ( GC) are not in detail and still remain to be studied. In the present study , the endogenous expression of YWHAZ in gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 was silenced by YWHAZ-specific short hairpin RNA ( shRNA). Our data showed that YWHAZ silencing resulted in cell cycle arrest in BGC-823 cells. Further , YWHAZ-silenced BGC-823 cells acquired increased apoptosis rate , which was confirmed by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 , cleaved PARP , and Bax , and decreased level of Bcl-2. Suppression of YWHAZ also promoted autophagy , confirming by the upregulation of LC3II/ LC3I ratio , and downregulation of p62 level. Moreover , YWHAZ suppression inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in BGC-823 cells. LY294002 ( PI3K/AKT inhibitor , 200 nM) further promoted YWHAZ silencing-induced apoptosis and autophagy in BGC-823 cells , while insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1; PI3K/AKT agonist , 10 ng/ml) had the opposite role. Finally , suppression of YWHAZ inhibited the growth of the xenograft tumor in vivo. This study provides extended evidence that YWHAZ can be a potential therapeutic target for GC.
