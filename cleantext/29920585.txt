  Cavernous malformations of the third ventricle are uncommon vascular lesions<symptom>. Evidence suggests that cavernous malformations in this location might have a more aggressive natural history due to their risk of intraventricular hemorrhage<symptom> and hydrocephalus<symptom> .1 The gold standard of treatment is considered to be microsurgical gross total resection of the lesion<symptom>. However , with progressive improvement in endoscopic capabilities , several authors have recently advocated for the role of minimally-invasive neuroendoscopy for resecting intraventricular cavernous malformations.2-4 In this timely intraoperative video , we demonstrate the gross total resection of a third ventricle cavernous malformation that presented with hemorrhage<symptom> via a right-sided trans-frontal neuroendoscopic approach.
