  Lipid emulsion has been shown to be an effective treatment for systemic toxicity induced by local anesthetics , which is reflected in case reports. A systemic review and meta-analysis confirm the efficacy of this treatment. Investigators have suggested mechanisms associated with the lipid emulsion-mediated recovery of cardiovascular collapse caused by local anesthetic systemic toxicity; these mechanisms include lipid sink , a widely accepted theory in which highly soluble local anesthetics ( particularly bupivacaine) are absorbed into the lipid phase of plasma from tissues ( e.g. , the heart) affected by local-anesthetic-induced toxicity; enhanced redistribution ( lipid shuttle); fatty acid supply; reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction; inotropic effects; glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² phosphorylation associated with inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening; inhibition of nitric oxide release; and reversal of cardiac sodium channel blockade. The current review includes the following: 1) an introduction , 2) a list of the proposed mechanisms , 3) a discussion of the best lipid emulsion treatment for reversal of local anesthetic toxicity , 4) a description of the effect of epinephrine on lipid emulsion-mediated resuscitation , 5) a description of the recommended lipid emulsion treatment , and 6) a conclusion.
