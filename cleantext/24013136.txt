  The gut microbiome and its role in health and disease have recently been major focus areas of research. In this review , we summarize the different ways in which the gut microbiome interacts with the rest of the body , with focus areas on its relationships with immunity , the brain , and injury. The gut ‚Åª brain axis , a communication network linking together the central and enteric nervous systems , represents a key bidirectional pathway with feed-forward and feedback mechanisms. The gut microbiota has a central role in this pathway and is significantly altered following injury , leading to a pro-inflammatory state within the central nervous system ( CNS). Herein , we examine traumatic brain injury ( TBI) in relation to this axis and explore potential interventions , which may serve as targets for improving clinical outcomes and preventing secondary brain injury.
