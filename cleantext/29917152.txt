  Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) is partially impaired in patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS). When given chemotherapy before receiving hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation , GFR might be further deteriorated. To measure the effect of cyclophosphamide on GFR in patients with MS who undergo chemotherapy. We estimated GFR based on creatinine and cystatin C plasma concentrations in patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation to treat their MS. Baseline GFR values were lower in the 28 patients with MS than in the 20 healthy individuals. Also , according to the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaborative Group ( CKD-EPI) 2012 Creat-CysC equation criteria , 4 of 28 patients were classified as having chronic kidney disease ( CKD) before receiving the chemotherapy drugs. After receiving 4 Ã— 50 mg per kg body<symptom> weight cyclophosphamide , abnormal GFR results were recorded in 12 of 28 patients. Renal function must be monitored in patients with MS undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation. Also , chemotherapy should be constrained as much as possible to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
