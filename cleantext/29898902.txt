  This study explored neoplasm risk with liraglutide versus placebo in the LEADER ( Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) cohort. LEADER ( NCT01179048) was an international , phase 3b , randomized , double-blind , controlled trial. Participants aged ≥ 50 years with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk were assigned 1:1 to receive liraglutide ( ≤ 1.8 mg daily; Neoplasm was confirmed in 10.1 % of patients with liraglutide versus 9.0 % with placebo ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.12 ( 95 % CI 0.99; 1.28)). The HR ( 95 % CI) for liraglutide versus placebo was 1.06 ( 0.90; 1.25) for malignant neoplasms and 1.16 ( 0.93; 1.44) for benign neoplasms. Sensitivity analyses excluding neoplasms occurring < 1 year or < 2 years after randomization and analyses by sex provided similar results. In our main analyses , the 95 % CI for the HR included one for all malignant neoplasms evaluated ( including pancreatic and thyroid neoplasms) except for prostate neoplasms , which occurred in fewer liraglutide-treated patients. LEADER was not primarily designed to assess neoplasm risk. Firm conclusions can not be made regarding numeric imbalances observed for individual neoplasm types ( e.g. , pancreatic cancer) that occurred infrequently. LEADER data do , however , exclude a major increase in the risk of total malignant neoplasms with liraglutide versus placebo. Additional studies are needed to assess longer-term exposure.
