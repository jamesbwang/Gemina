  Here , a novel anticancer gene therapy with a bacterial tRNase gene , colicin D or virulence associated protein C ( VapC) , is suggested using biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles , such as poly ( Î²-amino esters) ( PBAEs) as carriers. These genes are meticulously selected , aiming at inhibiting translation in the recipients by hydrolyzing specific tRNA species. In terms of nanoparticles , out of 9 PBAE formulations , a leading polymer , ( polyethylene oxide)
