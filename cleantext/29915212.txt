  Hereditary spastic paraplegias<symptom> ( HSPs) are characterized by various inherited disorders in which weakness<symptom> and spasticity of the lower extremities are the predominant symptoms. Recently , HSP caused by ALDH18A1 mutations has been reported as SPG9 with autosomal dominant ( SPG9A) and autosomal recessive ( SPG9B) transmission. In this study , we obtained clinical and genetic findings in two Japanese families with SPG9B. One family had a novel compound heterozygous mutation ( c. 1321 C > T/c .1994 G > A) in the ALDH18A1 gene. The other family had a homozygous mutation ( c. 383 G > A/c .383 G > A) in the ALDH18A1 gene. To date , only two SPG9B families with ALDH18A1 mutations have been reported. This is the first report of SPG9 in non-Caucasians. Furthermore , we found cerebellar ataxia<symptom> in one family , although cerebellar ataxia<symptom> has not been reported in SPG9B so far. SPG9B might involve a complicated HSP including cerebellar ataxia<symptom> and cognitive impairment. This study expands the clinical and genetic spectrum of ALDH18A1-related disorders.
