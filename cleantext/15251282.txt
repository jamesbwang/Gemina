  The flavin cofactors FMN and FAD are required for a wide variety of biological processes , however , little is known about their metabolism. Here , we report the cloning and biochemical characterization of the Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> pyrophosphatase Fpy1p. Genetic and functional studies suggest that Fpy1p may play a key role in flavin metabolism and is the first-reported non-Nudix superfamily enzyme to display FAD pyrophosphatase activity. Characterization of mutant yeast strains found that deletion of fpy1 counteracts the adverse effects that are caused by deletion of flx1 , a known mitochondrial FAD transporter. We show that Fpy1p is capable of hydrolyzing FAD , NAD ( H) , and ADP-ribose. The enzymatic activity of Fpy1p is dependent upon the presence of K + and divalent metal cations , with similar kinetic parameters to those that have been reported for Nudix FAD pyrophosphatases. In addition , we report that the deletion of fpy1 intensifies the FMN-dependence of null mutants of the riboflavin kinase Fmn1p , demonstrate that fpy1 mutation abolishes the decreased fitness resulting from the deletion of the flx1 ORF , and offer a possible mechanism for the genetic interplay between fpy1 , flx1 and fmn1.
