  The insulin-like growth factors ( IGFs) , IGF-I and IGF-II , are essential for regulating cell growth , differentiation and metastasis of a broad range of malignancies. The IGF-I/II actions are mediated through the IGF receptor type 1 ( IGF-1R) and the insulin receptor ( IR) , which are overexpressed in multiple types of tumors. Here , we have firstly identified a human engineered antibody domain ( eAd) from a phage-displayed VH library. The eAd suppressed the signal transduction of IGF-1R mediated by exogenous IGF-I or IGF-II in breast cancer cell lines through neutralizing both IGF-I and IGF-II. It also significantly inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells. Therefore , the anti-IGF-I/II eAd offers an alternative approach to target both the IGF-1R signaling pathways through the inhibition of IGF-I/II.
