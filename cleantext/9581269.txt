  The anterior end of calcaneum fractures can present as inversion injuries , stress fractures or as a part of displaced intraarticular calcaneum fracture. Rarely , these may occur due to abduction injury from a laterally directed force that crushes the anterior calcaneum instead of the cuboid , and has associated medial column injuries which are unrecognized. Compression fractures of the anterior calcaneum are actually lateral column shortening injuries with poor outcomes in the few published reports. We describe three patients with compression fractures of the anterior end of calcaneum resulting from foot abduction injury which were managed by reduction and column length restoration via distraction by external fixator. All three fractures showed good to excellent outcomes using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot score at followup > 1 year. Awareness of this injury pattern is important , and appropriate measures to reduce and maintain the fracture reduction are needed to avoid long term disability.
