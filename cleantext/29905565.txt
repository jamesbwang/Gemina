  We studied the effect of Quercetin on energy profile of erythrocytes of rats with the overactive bladder syndrome<disease>. It was shown that animal models with the subject pathology demonstrated alteration of quantitative composition of the adenine nucleotide system in erythrocytes. Abrupt decrease of the total concentration of adenyl nucleotides and ATP compared to the intact group of animals was noted in the study. Administration of Quercetin significantly improved the energy profile of erythrocytes in rats with the overactive bladder syndrome<disease>. The data obtained provide new findings of the pathogenesis and correction regimens for the subject pathology.
