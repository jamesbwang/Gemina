  An adequate consent form must be completed prior to a planned surgical procedure. Consent forms are mandatory , but the form itself does not reflect or quantify the adequacy of the discussion between surgeon and patient or the patient 's level of understanding. This study audited the adequate completion of consent forms for orthopaedic operations at a Major Trauma Centre in the United Kingdom. We also suggested recommendations regarding the completion of consent forms and proposed that tuition concerning the consent process be included as part of mandatory training for surgeons.
