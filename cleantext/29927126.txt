  Fluorescence molecular imaging is widely used to visualize and observe different biomolecules , in particular DNA and RNA , in vivo and in real time. Typically , DNA strands are tagged with only one fluorophore , and , in the case of molecular beacons , an additional quencher is conjugated , which bears the risk of false-positive or false-negative results because only fluorescence intensities at one fluorescence wavelength ( color) are compared. To address this drawback , the concept of `` DNA/RNA traffic lights , '' which is characterized by a fluorescence color<symptom> change<symptom> due to energy transfer between two dyes , was developed by our working group. For these DNA and RNA systems , the oligonucleotides are post-synthetically labeled , specifically after solid-phase synthesis by chemical means , with a fluorescent dye using copper ( I)- catalyzed cycloaddition at the 2 ' position of single uridines. In order to functionalize oligonucleotides with several different labels , an on-resin method is required to ensure the necessary selectivity. This unit describes two different CuAAC ( `` click '') approaches-in solution ( post-synthetic) and on solid phase ( during synthesis)- for the attachment of fluorophores to the 2 ' position of DNA.
