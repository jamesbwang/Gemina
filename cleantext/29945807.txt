  Intramural hematomas ( IMHs) are reported to dynamically evolve into different clinical outcomes ranging from regression to aortic rupture , but no practice guidelines are available in China. To determine the evolution of IMHs after long-term follow-up and to identify the predictive factors of IMH outcomes in the Chinese population. A total of 123 IMH patients with clinical and imaging follow-up data were retrospectively studied. The primary endpoints were aortic disease-related death , aortic dissection , penetrating aortic ulcer<disease> ( PAU) , thickening of the aortic hematoma and aortic complications requiring surgical or endovascular treatment. All 123 IMH patients were monitored clinically. The follow-up duration ranged from 1.4 to 107 months ( median , 20 months). Thirty-nine patients had type A IMH , and 84 had type B. The multivariate analysis showed that a baseline MAD â‰¥ 44.75 mm ( 2.9 % vs 61.4 % , P < 0.001) and acute PAUs ( 2.9 % vs 34.1 % , P = 0.008) were independent predictors of aorta-related events. Medication and short-term imaging are recommended for Chinese IMH patients with a hematoma thickness < 10.45 mm and a baseline MAD < 44.75 mm. Rigorous medical observation should also be performed during the acute phase of IMH.
