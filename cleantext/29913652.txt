  Background The reported prevalence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ranges from 11 % to 64 % , and although consistently high , the calculated economic burden estimates also vary widely between studies. There is no standard way of classifying chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. We have repeated measurements of pain in a longitudinal population study to improve validity ofthe case ascertainment. In this paper , associations between chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and demographic characteristics , self reported health and functioning , work Incapacity and health care use were investigated in a sample from the general Norwegian population. Methods A random sample of 6419 participants from a population study ( the HUNT 3 Study) was invited to report pain every three months during a 12 month period. Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> was defined as moderate<symptom> pain<symptom> or more ( on the SF-8 verbal rating scale) in at least three out of five consecutive measurements. Self reported health and functioning was measured by seven of the eight subscales on the SF-8 health survey ( bodily pain was excluded). Health care utilisation during the past 12 months was measured by self report , and included seeing a general practitioner , seeing a medical specialist and seeing other therapists. The survey data was combined with information on income , education , disability pension awards and unemployment by Statistics Norway , which provided data from the National Education database ( NUDB) and the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration ( NAV). Results The total prevalence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> was 36 % ( 95 % CI34-38) among women and 25 % ( 95 % CI 22-26) among men. The prevalence increased with age , was higher among people with high BMI , and in people with low income and low educational level. Smoking was also associated with a higher prevalence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Subjects in the chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> group had a self-reported health and functioning in the range of 1-2.5 standard deviations below that of those without chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Among the chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> group 52 % ( 95 % CI 49-55) , of participants reported having seen a medical specialist during the 12 month study period and 49 % ( 95 % CI 46-52) had seen other health professionals. The corresponding proportions for the group without chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> were 32 % ( 95 % CI 29-34) and 22 % ( 95 % CI 20-25) , respectively. Work incapacity was strongly associated with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>: compared with those not having chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , the probability of being a receiver of disability pension was four times higher for those with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and the probability of being unemployed was twice has high for those with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. The population attributable fraction ( PAF) suggested that 49 % ( 95 % CI 42-54) of the disability pension awards and 20 % ( 13-27) of the unemployment were attributable to chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Conclusion and implications Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is a major challenge for authorities and health care providers both on a national , regional and local level and it is an open question how the problem can best be dealt with. However , a better integration of the various treatments and an adequate availability of multidisciplinary treatment seem to be important.
