  Skin sensitisers are substances that can elicit allergic responses following skin contact and the process by which this occurs is described as skin sensitisation. Skin sensitisation is defined as a series of key events , that form an adverse outcome pathway ( AOP). Key event three in the AOP is dendritic cell activation that can be modelled by the human Cell Line Activation Test ( h-CLAT) and is typified by changes in cell surface markers CD54 and CD86 in dendritic cells. The h-CLAT is accepted at a regulatory level ( OECD Test-Guideline ( TG) 442E) and can be used to assess skin sensitisation potential as part of an integrated approach to testing and assessment ( IATA). Stakeholders in the cosmetics and chemical industries have scientific and ethical concerns relating to use of animal derived material and have communicated a strong preference for fully human based in vitro methods. Therefore , we adapted the h-CLAT to animal-product-free conditions and validated the adapted method with the proficiency panel substances in Annex II of TG442E , using 3 independent batches of pooled human serum. The modified method showed equivalence to the validated reference method ( VRM) , as all proficiency substances were correctly classified. Comparable values for CV75 ( concentration yielding 75 % cell viability) , EC150 and EC200 ( concentration yielding RFI of ≥ 150 for CD86 and ≥ 200 for CD54) were obtained. Data generated using the adapted method may be used in European REACH submissions , provided the proficiency data is included. We are seeking formal inclusion of the adaptation into TG442E , enabling compliance with global regulations.
