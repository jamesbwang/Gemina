  Understanding the effect of natural colloidal particles ( NCPs) on the photochemistry of organic pollutants is crucial to predict the environmental persistence and fate of them in surface waters , and it is , yet , scarcely elucidated. In this study , the pre-filtered surface water ( through a 1 μm capsule filter) from Baiyangdian Lake was further separated into four different size NCPs: F1 ( 0.65-1.0 μm) , F2 ( 100 kD-0.65 μm) , F3 ( 10-100 kD) and F4 ( 1-10 kD) by cross-flow ultrafiltration ( CFUF) , and the photochemical kinetics and mechanisms of ofloxacin ( OFL) and enrofloxacin ( ENR) were investigated in the presence of those particles under simulated sunlight. Results showed that OFL and ENR underwent both direct and indirect photolysis in F1-F4 solutions , and the observed pseudo first-order rate constants ( k
