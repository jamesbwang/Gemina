  In this paper , the selective interactions of synthetic derivatives of two natural compounds , berberine and palmatine , with DNA G-quadruplex structures were reported. In particular , the previous works on this subject concerning berberine were further presented and discussed , whereas the results concerning palmatine are presented here for the first time. In detail , these palmatine derivatives were developed by inserting seven different small peptide basic chains , giving several new compounds that have never been reported before. The preliminary studies of the interactions of these compounds with various G-quadruplex-forming sequences were carried out by means of various structural and biochemical techniques , which showed that the presence of suitable side chains is very useful for improving the interaction of the ligands with G-quadruplex structures. Thus , these new palmatine derivatives might act as potential anticancer drugs.
