  Recent studies show contradictory data on the incidence of hospitalizations for acute bronchiolitis<disease> ( AB) and an escalating increase in public health burden. We aimed to analyze the population-based admission rate for AB in children under 2 years of age , in Portuguese public hospitals , from 2000 to 2015 , to assess trends and regional variations in admission rate; outcomes; associated direct health-care costs; and changes in management after the implementation of national guidelines. Retrospective observational study , conducted using a Portuguese administrative database , which contains all registered public hospitalizations in mainland Portugal , and demographic data from the National Statistics Institute. Over the study period , we recorded 80,491 admissions for AB. The mean admission rate was 26.28 and was higher in the northernmost regions of the country. Along the time , the admission rate rose by an average of 1.6 % per year ( 3.8 % in children younger than 3 months) and the average length of stay ( LOS) was 6.1 days and decreased , to a minimum of 5.5 days in 2014. The in-hospital mortality rate ( 0.1 %) and the use of invasive ventilation remained stable , but non-invasive ventilation use increased from 0.4 % in 2000 to 4 % in 2015. The direct estimated total costs were of 72,420,732 $. In recent years , there was a decrease in the reported tests and procedures. AB remains a major burden in the healthcare system. The admission rate increased but does not seem to be due to an increase in severity , as LOS decreased , and the use of invasive ventilation and mortality remained unchanged.
