  When living cells are observed at rest on a flat substrate , they can typically exhibit a rounded ( symmetric) or an elongated ( polarized) shape. Although the cells are apparently at rest , the active stress generated by the molecular motors<symptom> continuously stretches and drifts the actin network , the cytoskeleton of the cell. In this paper we theoretically compare the energy stored and dissipated in this active system in two geometric configurations of interest: symmetric and polarized. We find that the stored energy is larger for a radially symmetric cell at low activation regime , while the polar configuration has larger strain energy when the active stress is beyond a critical threshold. Conversely , the dissipation of energy in a symmetric cell is always larger than that of a nonsymmetric one. By a combination of symmetry arguments and competition between surface and bulk stress , we argue that radial symmetry is an energetically expensive metastable state that provides access to an infinite number of lower-energy states , the polarized configurations.
