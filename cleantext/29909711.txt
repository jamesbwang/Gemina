  Older adults with cognitive impairment may have difficulty understanding and complying with medical or medication instructions provided during hospitalization which may adversely impact patient outcomes. To evaluate the prevalence of cognitive impairment among patients aged 65 years and older within 24 hours of hospital admission using Mini-Cog ™ assessments performed by advanced pharmacy practice experience ( APPE) students. Students on APPE rotations were trained to perform Mini-Cog ™ assessments during routine medication education sessions from February 2017 to April 2017. The primary end point was the prevalence of cognitive impairment indicated by a Mini-Cog ™ score of ≤ 3. Secondary end points were the average number of observed Mini-Cog ™ practice assessments required for APPE students to meet competency requirements , caregiver identification , and 30-day hospital readmissions. Twelve APPE students completed the training program after an average of 4.4 ( standard deviation ( SD) = 1.0) graded Mini-Cog ™ assessments. Of the 1159 admissions screened , 273 were included in the analysis. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 55 % ( n = 149 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 48 % -61 %). A caregiver was identified for 41 % ( n = 113 , 95 % CI: 35 % -47 %) of patients , and 79 patients had a caregiver present at bedside during the visit. Hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge was 15 % ( n = 41 , 95 % CI: 11 % -20 %). Cognitive impairment could substantially impair a patient 's ability to comprehend education provided during hospitalization. Pharmacy students can feasibly perform Mini-Cog ™ assessments to evaluate cognitive function , thereby allowing them to tailor education content and involve caregivers when necessary.
