Influence of training models at 3,900-m altitude on the physiological<symptom> response<symptom> and performance of a professional wheelchair athlete: A case study. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This case study compared the effects of two training camps using flexible planning ( FP) vs. inflexible planning ( IP) at 3,860-m altitude on physiological and performance responses of an elite marathon wheelchair athlete with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT). During IP , the athlete completed preplanned training sessions. During FP , training was adjusted based on vagally mediated heart rate variability ( HRV) with specific sessions being performed when a reference HRV value was attained. The camp phases were baseline in normoxia ( BN) , baseline in hypoxia ( BH) , specific training weeks 1-4 ( W1 , W2 , W3 , W4) , and Post-camp ( Post). Outcome measures included the root mean square of successive R-R interval differences ( rMSSD) , resting heart rate ( HRrest) , oxygen saturation ( SO2) , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , power output and a 3,000-m test. A greater impairment of normalized rMSSD ( BN) was shown in IP during BH ( 57.30 ± 2.38 % vs. 72.94 ± 11.59 % , p = 0.004) , W2 ( 63.99 ± 10.32 % vs. 81.65 ± 8.87 % , p = 0.005) , and W4 ( 46.11 ± 8.61 % vs. 59.35 ± 6.81 % , p = 0.008). At Post , only in FP was rMSSD restored ( 104.47 ± 35.80 %). Relative changes were shown in power output ( +3 W in IP vs. +6 W in FP) and 3,000-m test ( -7 s in IP vs. -16 s in FP). This case study demonstrated that FP resulted in less suppression and faster restoration of rMSSD and more positive changes in performance than IP in an elite wheelchair marathoner with CMT.
