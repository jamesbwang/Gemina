  Fractures of the orbital floor and orbital rim are frequently treated in maxillofacial departments. Various approaches to the orbital floor are described in the literature. We present an investigation of a modified subciliary approach ( laterocaudal approach) with respect to its feasibility and clinical outcome. Our retrospective study investigated 130 well-documented cases of patients with orbital floor fractures who received surgical reconstruction using a laterocaudal approach , and compared the results with the current literature , with a focus on subciliary and transconjunctival approaches. 111 patients ( 85.4 %) presented a Vancouver scar scale ( VSS) of 0.14 patients ( 10.8 %) had a VSS score of 1. No patients had a VSS of 2. Just five patients ( 3.8 %) had a slight ectropium and therefore a VSS score of 3. The laterocaudal approach can be safely performed and presents advantages over comparable techniques such as the subciliary and transconjunctival approaches if performed correctly.
