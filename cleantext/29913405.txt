  Medial temporal lobe epilepsy ( mTLE)- the most common form of focal epilepsy-is defined by recurrent partial<symptom> seizures<symptom> originating within the medial temporal lobe. Such seizures<symptom> are commonly associated with the anterior hippocampus ( as opposed to the posterior hippocampus) , and refractory to the currently available anti-epileptic drugs ( AED) for about one third of patients. Unfortunately , the mechanisms driving seizure<symptom> generation and AED efficacy along the longitudinal hippocampal axis remain poorly understood. Recently , several groups investigating differences in excitability along the rodent longitudinal hippocampal axis have demonstrated that CA1 pyramidal neurons from the rodent ventral hippocampus ( the rodent homolog of the human anterior hippocampus) are intrinsically more excitable than their dorsal counterparts ( the rodent homolog of the human posterior hippocampus). This phenotypic difference is accompanied by significant differences in gene expression along the longitudinal hippocampal axis , which include gene products-such as voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunits-known to influence AED efficacy. Given this phenotypic heterogeneity , and the differential expression of gene products known to influence anti-epileptic drug efficacy , we sought to investigate the efficacy of the classical use-dependent sodium channel blocker , carbamazepine , in CA1 pyramidal neurons across the longitudinal hippocampal axis. Accordingly , we performed whole-cell current-clamp recordings on CA1 pyramidal neurons from acute hippocampal slices prepared from the dorsal and ventral hippocampus , and found that acute exposure to 100 μM carbamazepine induced a significantly greater suppression of repetitive firing for dorsal neurons relative to ventral neurons by inducing profound spike frequency adaptation ( SFA). Moreover , we observed a small , but significant depolarization of resting membrane potential ( RMP) for dorsal neurons ( but not ventral neurons) , following exposure to carbamazepine. Together , these observations demonstrate that carbamazepine 's effect is concentrated in the dorsal hippocampus , which could provide meaningful insight into the side effect profile of carbamazepine ( and related anti-epileptic drugs) in non-epileptic tissue , and inform future work investigating the mechanisms of carbamazepine resistance in epileptic tissue.
