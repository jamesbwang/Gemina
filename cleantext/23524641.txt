  Either metformin or liraglutide has been reported to have anti-tumor effects on pancreatic cancer cells. However , it is not clear whether their combined treatment has additive or synergistic anti-tumor effects on pancreatic cancer cells. In this study , the human pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaca-2 was incubated with liraglutide and/or metformin. The cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8) , colony formation , flow cytometry , and wound-healing and transwell migration assays were used to detect cell viability , clonogenic survival , cell cycle and cell migration , respectively. RT-PCR and western blot analyses were used to determine the mRNA and protein levels of related molecules. Results showed that combination treatment with liraglutide ( 100 nmol/L) and metformin ( 0.75 mmol/L) significantly decreased cell viability and colony formation , caused cell cycle arrest , upregulated the level of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 , and inhibited cell migration in the cells , although their single treatment did not exhibit such effects. Combination index value for cell viability indicated a synergistic interaction of liraglutide and metformin. Moreover , the combined treatment with liraglutide and metformin could activate the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) more potently than their single treatment in the cells. These results suggest that liraglutide in combination with metformin has a synergistic anti-tumor effect on the pancreatic cancer cells , which may be at least partly due to activation of AMPK signaling. Our study provides new insights into the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer.
