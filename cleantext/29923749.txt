  Many adolescents and young adults get insufficient sleep. A link between sleep loss and risk-taking behavior has been consistently found in the literature , but surprisingly , the role played by the origin of sleep loss in this link has never been investigated. Sleep loss can be voluntary ( instead of sleeping , a significant amount of time is devoted to other activities) or involuntary ( caused by a sleep disorder , for example , insomnia). The aim of this research was to investigate whether both types of sleep loss are associated to the same extent with risky behavior. Five hundred thirty-six university students between 19 and 25 years old participated in this study. Three groups were selected: participants with voluntary sleep loss , participants with insomnia , and normal sleepers. We assessed risk-taking behavior in virtual driving situations , as well as drinking habits in terms of quantity and frequency. To further explore the differences between the groups , we also measured sensation seeking , a personality trait related to risk-taking behavior. Compared to participants with insomnia and normal sleepers , participants with voluntary sleep loss take more risks in dangerous driving situations , drink more alcohol , and have higher disinhibition scores on the Sensation-Seeking Scale. On the other hand , no such differences were found between participants with insomnia and normal sleepers , suggesting that sleep loss is not always associated with risk taking. Whether sleep loss is associated with risk-taking behavior or not could depend on the origin of sleep loss and the underlying personality traits.
