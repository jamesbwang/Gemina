  Selective clearance of senescent cells ( SCs) has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for age-related diseases , as well as chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced adverse effects. Through a cell-based phenotypic screening approach , we recently identified piperlongumine ( PL) , a dietary natural product , as a novel senolytic agent , referring to small molecules that can selectively kill SCs over normal or non-senescent cells. In an effort to establish the structure-senolytic activity relationships of PL analogues , we performed a series of structural modifications on the trimethoxyphenyl and the α,β-unsaturated δ-valerolactam rings of PL. We show that modifications on the trimethoxyphenyl ring are well tolerated , while the Michael acceptor on the lactam ring is critical for the senolytic activity. Replacing the endocyclic C2-C3 olefin with an exocyclic methylene at C2 render PL analogues 47-49 with increased senolytic activity. These α-methylene containing analogues are also more potent than PL in inducing ROS production in WI-38 SCs. Similar to PL , 47-49 reduce the protein levels of oxidation resistance 1 ( OXR1) , an important oxidative stress response protein that regulates the expression of a variety of antioxidant enzymes , in cells. This study represents a useful starting point toward the discovery of senolytic agents for therapeutic uses.
