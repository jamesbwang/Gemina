  The concept of precision medicine is not new , as multiplex and very sensitive methods , or next-generation sequencing and matched targeted cancer therapies , have come to clinical practice. Substantial progress has been made from the discovery to the development and clinical application of biomarkers and matched targeted therapies. However , there still remain many challenges and issues to be overcome in each step , from acquisition of tumour tissues through validation of biomarkers to the final decision on targeted therapy. This review will briefly touch on these issues , hoping to provide a better understanding and application of targeted therapy in cancer treatment in the era of precision medicine and immuno-oncology. It also helps to understand that the meaning or value of biomarker ( s) and matched targeted therapy changes along with expansion of knowledge and advance of methodology , and constant efforts have to be made in evaluating the meaning and clinical value during the development and after the establishment of biomarkers or the approval of matched targeted therapies , which might be more complicated by the advent of new therapeutic agents and new diagnostic methods.
