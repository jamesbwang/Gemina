  Recent investigations have indicated that hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer ( BC) , and the addition of synthetic progestins may play a critical role in this. Several studies have pointed out the important role of progesterone receptor membrane component 1 ( PGRMC1) in the development of BC , especially with hormone therapy using progestins. Although the deregulation of microRNA-181a ( miR-181a) is often associated with human BC , the effect of miR-181a on PGRMC1 expression during hormone therapy has not been investigated. Cell viability assay and apoptosis assay were performed to investigate the pro-BC effect of progestin ( norethisterone , NET) and anti-BC effect of miR-181a on MCF-7 cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to evaluate gene expressions in the NET-treated MCF-7 cells. NET dose-dependently increased BC cell viability and this effect was accompanied by increased expression of PGRMC1. Overexpression of miR-181a strongly reduced the cell viability of MCF-7 cells , mainly through increased apoptosis , which was evidenced by substantially increased gene expression of pro-apoptosis factors such as BAX and CASPASE 9 in miR-181a overexpressed cells. Importantly , miR-181a abrogated NET-stimulated cell viability and PGRMC1 expression. We provide evidence that miR-181a promotes MCF-7 cell apoptosis. Moreover , miR-181a suppressed NET-provoked cell viability and PGRMC1 expression in MCF-7 cells. These data may suggest a therapeutic strategy of using miR-181a to reduce BC risk in progestin hormone replacement therapy.
