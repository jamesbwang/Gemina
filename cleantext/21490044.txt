  Sufficient-cause interaction ( also called mechanistic interaction or causal co-action) has received considerable attention recently. Two statistical tests , the ` relative excess risk due to interaction ' ( RERI) test and the ` peril ratio index of synergy based on multiplicativity ' ( PRISM) test , were developed specifically to test such an interaction in cohort studies. In addition , these two tests can be applied in case-control studies for rare diseases but are not valid for non-rare diseases. In this study , we proposed a method to incorporate the information of disease prevalence to estimate the perils of particular diseases. Moreover , we adopted the PRISM test to assess the sufficient-cause interaction in case-control studies for non-rare diseases. The Monte Carlo simulation showed that our proposed method can maintain reasonably accurate type I error rates in all situations. Its powers are comparable to the odds-scale PRISM test and far greater than the risk-scale RERI test and the odds-scale RERI test. In light of its desirable statistical properties , we recommend using the proposed method to test for sufficient-cause interactions between two binary exposures in case-control studies.
