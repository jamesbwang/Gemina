  By inverting the common structural motif of thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials to a rigid donor core and multiple peripheral acceptors , reverse intersystem crossing ( rISC) rates are demonstrated in an organic material that enables utilization of triplet excited states at faster rates than Ir-based phosphorescent materials. A combination of the inverted structure and multiple donor-acceptor interactions yields up to 30 vibronically coupled singlet and triplet states within 0.2 eV that are involved in rISC. This gives a significant enhancement to the rISC rate , leading to delayed fluorescence decay times as low as 103.9 ns. This new material also has an emission quantum yield â‰ˆ 1 and a very small singlet-triplet gap. This work shows that it is possible to achieve both high photoluminescence quantum yield and fast rISC in the same molecule.
