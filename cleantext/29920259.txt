  Present-day giant pandas ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are estimated to have diverged from their closest relatives , all other bears , ∼ 20 million years ago , based on molecular data ( 1). With fewer than 2,500 individuals living today ( 2) , it is unclear how well genetic data from extant and historical giant pandas ( 3) reflect the past ( 3). To date , there has been no complete mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) sequenced from an ancient giant panda. Here , we use ancient DNA capture techniques ( 4) to sequence the complete mitochondrial genome of a ∼ 22,000-year-old giant panda specimen ( radiocarbon date of 21,910-21,495 cal BP with ± 2σ at 95.4 % probability; Lab.no Beta-473743) from the Cizhutuo Cave , in Leye County , Guangxi Province , China ( Figure 1A). Its date and location in Guangxi , where no wild giant pandas live today , as well as the difficulty of DNA preservation in a hot and humid region , place it as a unique specimen to learn about ancient giant pandas from the last glacial maximum. We find that the mtDNA lineage of the Cizhutuo panda coalesced with present-day pandas ∼ 183 thousand years ago ( kya , 95 % HPD , 227-144 kya) , earlier than the time to the most recent common ancestor ( TMRCA) of mtDNA lineages shared by present-day pandas ( ∼ 72 kya , 95 % HPD , 94-55 kya , Supplemental Information). Furthermore , the Cizhutuo panda possessed 18 non-synonymous mutations across six mitochondrial genes. Our results show that the Cizhutuo mtDNA lineage underwent a distinct history from that of present-day populations.
