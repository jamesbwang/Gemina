  Heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1) is an antioxidant and cytoprotective protein , which has been proven to alleviate the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs) and the development of liver fibrosis<disease>. However , the role of HO-1 in HSC apoptosis remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of HO-1 on HSC apoptosis and its possible underlying mechanisms. HSCs-T6 were incubated with different concentrations of hemin ( HO-1 chemical inducer) and Znpp-IX ( HO-1 chemical inhibitor) for 12 , 24 and 48 h. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay. HSCs were classified into 4 groups as follows: Control , hemin , Znpp-IX and hemin + Znpp-IX co-treatment groups. Apoptosis was quantitatively measured by Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay. The mRNA and protein expression of HO-1 , α-smooth muscle actin , B-cell lymphoma ( Bcl) -2 , caspase-3 and nuclear factor ( NF)- κB p65 were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The levels of tumor growth factor ( TGF)- β and interleukin ( IL) -6 in HSC supernatants were examined by ELISA. The results demonstrated that HO-1 exerted antiproliferative effects on HSCs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Increasing HO-1 expression induced HSC apoptosis
