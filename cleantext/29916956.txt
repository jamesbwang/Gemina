  Retrospective multicenter study OBJECTIVE.: We aimed to assess the outcomes following posterior cervical decompression for cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( CSM) in a large sample of patients older than 80 years. Although age is a predictor of surgical outcomes for CSM , most previous studies have only investigated the effect of age for patients aged 65-75 years , and surgical outcomes remain unclear for older patients. Patients older than 50 years who underwent posterior cervical decompression for CSM were enrolled from 17 institutions. The patients were grouped into a young-old group ( < 80 years old) and an old-old group ( 80 years and older). Clinical information , comorbidities , perioperative complications , Japanese Orthopaedic Association ( JOA) scores , Japanese Orthopaedic Association Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire ( JOACMEQ) , visual analog scale ( VAS) scores , and radiographic parameters were compared between the two groups. All patients were followed for at least one year after surgery. The young-old and old-old groups included 491 and 77 patients , respectively. The JOA score and quality of life measured by JOACMEQ improved significantly after surgery in both groups. Compared with the young-old group , the old-old group had lower preoperative JOA scores ( 9.6 vs. 11.0) , lower final JOA scores ( 12.6 vs. 14.0) , and lower recovery rates ( 42 % vs. 50 %). However , there were no significant differences in perioperative complications or in the VAS scores at the final assessments. The old-old group had a higher mean preoperative sagittal Cobb angle at C2-C5 , though this was not statistically significant postoperatively. Posterior decompression surgery is safe and beneficial for patients older than 80 years with CSM , despite having a more limited neurological recovery compared with younger patients. 3.
