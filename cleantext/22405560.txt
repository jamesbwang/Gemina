  Hyperaccumulator plants have the unique ability to concentrate specific elements in their shoot in concentrations that can be thousands of times greater than in normal plants. Whereas all known zinc hyperaccumulator plants are facultative hyperaccumulators with only populations on metalliferous soils hyperaccumulating zinc ( except for Arabidopsis halleri and Noccaea species that hyperaccumulate zinc irrespective of the substrate) , the present study discovered that Dichapetalum gelonioides is the only ( zinc) hyperaccumulator known to occur exclusively on ` normal ' soils , while hyperaccumulating zinc. We recorded remarkable foliar zinc concentrations ( 10 730 Âµg g
