  Silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) are gaining a great deal of attention in biomedical applications due to their unique physicochemical properties. In this study , green synthesis of AgNPs was developed using seaweed polysaccharide fucoidan. The AgNPs were further coated with chitosan to form an electrolyte complex on the surface. The developed chitosan ⁻ fucoidan complex-coated AgNPs were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) , and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM). FT-IR results suggested strong polyelectrolyte complexation between fucoidan and chitosan. The developed chitosan ⁻ fucoidan complex-coated AgNPs significantly inhibited microbial growth. Moreover , the AgNPs showed efficient anticancer activity in human cervical cancer cells ( HeLa). This study demonstrated that chitosan ⁻ fucoidan complex-coated AgNPs hold high potential for food and cosmeceutical applications.
