  Background The osteoplastic flap provides access to pathology of the frontal sinus and is often performed with obliteration , which can result in significant long-term complications. Objective To describe the authors ' approach to osteoplastic flap without obliteration. Methods Descriptive analysis. Results Osteoplastic flap without obliteration preserves frontal sinus function while permitting direct access to the frontal sinus. In this study , we demonstrate a combined nonobliterated approach , accessing the frontal sinus with a Draf III approach to remove a large frontal sinus osteoma. Conclusion The approach provides excellent exposure for large tumors not otherwise accessible via purely endoscopic procedures , permits improved surveillance , and minimizes long-term complications of obliterated sinuses.
