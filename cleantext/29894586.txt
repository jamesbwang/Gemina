  In the thirty patients with aortic regurgitation in the Jupiter Postmarket Registry , initial device success of JenaValve implantation showed a high success rate of > 95 % with a device success rate of ∼ 89 %. At one year transvalvar aortic gradients were an acceptable ∼ 13 mm Hg. Aortic regurgitation in patients in the Jupiter Postmarket Registry continued to be reduced at one-year follow-up with no/trace aortic regurgitation in 50 % ( though numbers are small). Patients with aortic regurgitation constitute a small number ( ∼ 10-15 %) of patients with symptomatic aortic valve disease , and follow-up numbers in the Jupiter Postmarket Registry are small ( 30 patients) with one year echo data in only 23 patients , making broad conclusions about JenaValve results for patients with aortic regurgitation problematic.
