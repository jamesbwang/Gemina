  Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia , a severe respiratory disorder caused by Mycoplasma<pathogen> mycoides<pathogen> subsp. mycoides<pathogen> ( Mmm). The present study investigated the generation of ROS by different strains of Mmm , as well as their effect on the oxidative response of bovine neutrophils. The production of ROS was indirectly measured using a luminol-based chemiluminescence assay. Our results confirm that Mmm can produce ROS via the metabolism of glycerol , significant differences existing between African and European strains. Mmm was capable of adhering to the external surface of neutrophils. Interestingly , Mmm enhanced the respiratory burst of bovine neutrophils. This activity was particularly pronounced with the African field strain and in presence of glycerol. Taken together , our data argue in favour of a major role for neutrophils as the main source of ROS in contagious bovine pleuropneumonia.
