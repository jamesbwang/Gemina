  Silk is considered to be a potential biomaterial for a wide number of biomedical applications. Silk fibroin ( SF) can be retrieved in sufficient quantities from the cocoons produced by silkworms. While it is easy to formulate into scaffolds with favorable mechanical properties , the natural SF does not contain bioactive functions. Spider silk proteins , on the contrary , can be produced in fusion with bioactive protein domains , but the recombinant procedures are expensive , and large-scale production is challenging. We combine the two types of silk to fabricate affordable , functional tissue-engineered constructs for wound-healing applications. Nanofibrous mats and microporous scaffolds made of natural silkworm SF are used as a bulk material that are top-coated with the recombinant spider silk protein ( 4RepCT) in fusion with a cell-binding motif , antimicrobial peptides , and a growth factor. For this , the inherent silk properties are utilized to form interactions between the two silk types by self-assembly. The intended function , that is , improved cell adhesion , antimicrobial activity , and growth factor stimulation , could be demonstrated for the obtained functionalized silk mats. As a skin prototype , SF scaffolds coated with functionalized silk are cocultured with multiple cell types to demonstrate formation of a bilayered tissue construct with a keratinized epidermal layer under in vitro conditions. The encouraging results support this strategy of fabrication of an affordable bioactive SF-spider silk-based biomaterial for wound<disease> dressings and skin substitutes.
