  The severity of anxiety<symptom> , in general , has been associated with suicide ideation ( SI) among youth , but research has yet to examine the specific anxiety<symptom> symptoms that may contribute to SI among youth. This study examined the severity of specific anxiety<symptom> symptom clusters ( i.e. , tense/restless , somatic/autonomic symptoms , humiliation/rejection , performing in public , separation anxiety<symptom> , perfectionism , and anxious coping) and SI in youth who met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety<symptom> disorder. Participants ( N = 87) were treatment-seeking children and adolescents ages 6-17 ( M = 11.1 years , SD = 3.06; 52.9 % male) diagnosed with a principal anxiety<symptom> disorder. Youth and their parents completed measures of youth anxiety<symptom> symptom severity , depression<symptom> , and SI. Hierarchical linear regressions revealed that when anxiety<symptom> symptom clusters were entered simultaneously , only youth self-reported ( and not parent-reported) somatic/autonomic symptoms of anxiety<symptom> significantly predicted SI , after controlling for depression<symptom> and sex. Importantly , the relationship between somatic/autonomic symptoms of anxiety<symptom> and SI was stronger than that between depression<symptom> and SI. These results suggest that assessing somatic symptoms of anxiety<symptom> is especially important when quantifying suicide risk among anxiety-disordered youth.
