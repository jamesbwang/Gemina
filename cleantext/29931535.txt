  Red swamp crayfish , Procambarus clarkii , presently is an important aquatic commercial species in China. The crayfish is a hot area of research focus , and its genetic improvement is quite urgent for the crayfish aquaculture in China. However , the knowledge of its genomic landscape is limited. In this study , a survey of P. clarkii genome was investigated based on Illumina 's Solexa sequencing platform. Meanwhile , its genome size was estimated using flow cytometry. Interestingly , the genome size estimated is about 8.50 Gb by flow cytometry and 1.86 Gb with genome survey sequencing. Based on the assembled genome sequences , total of 136,962 genes and 152,268 exons were predicted , and the predicted genes ranged from 150 to 12,807 bp in length. The survey sequences could help accelerate the progress of gene discovery involved in genetic diversity and evolutionary analysis , even though it could not successfully applied for estimation of P. clarkii genome size.
