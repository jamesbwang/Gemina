  When ambiguous visual stimuli are presented continuously , they often lead to oscillations between usually two perceptions. Because of these oscillations , it has been thought that the underlying neural dynamics also arises from a binary or two-state system. Contradicting the binary assumption , it has been shown recently that the perception of some ambiguous stimuli is governed by continuously varying internal states , measured as biases that differ considerably from one observer to the next and that can also evolve over time ( Wexler , Duyck , & Mamassian , 2015). Here I study bias patterns in the motion quartet , an ambiguous apparent motion stimulus , as the quartet 's orientation is varied. The bias patterns are robustly idiosyncratic , and are even more complex than those that have been described previously. There are two qualitatively different bias types: Some observers prefer a translation axis , while others show preference for a rotation direction. Each type also varies parametrically: the orientation of the preferred axis , and the direction of preferred rotation. There are also clear cases of combination of the two bias types. When measured repeatedly over 9 hr , the bias patterns usually remain stable , but also sometimes evolve both parametrically ( e.g. , change of preferred axis) , as well as across bias type ( change from axial to rotational bias). Control experiments revealed that the variety of bias patterns observed across subjects , and their changes over time , are not due to voluntary decisions. Overall , these results exhibit the multidimensional complexity of internal states underlying the perception of even simple stimuli.
