  Fabrication of polymer membranes<symptom> with nanopores and a confinement effect toward enzyme immobilization has been an enabling endeavor. In the work reported here , an enzyme reactor based on a thermoresponsive magnetic porous block copolymer membrane was designed and constructed. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization was used to synthesize the block copolymer , poly ( maleic anhydride-styrene-N-isopropylacrylamide) , with poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide) as the thermoresponsive moiety. The self-assembly property of the block copolymer was used for preparation of magnetic porous thin film matrices with iron oxide nanoparticles. By covalent bonding of glutaminase onto the surface of the membrane matrices and changing the temperature to tune the nanopore size , we observed enhanced enzymolysis efficiency due to the confinement effect. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant and the maximum rate of the enzyme reactor were determined ( K
