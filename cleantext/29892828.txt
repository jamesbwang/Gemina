  Resistance to thyroid hormone beta ( RTHβ) is a syndrome<disease> characterized by reduced responsiveness of peripheral tissues to thyroid hormone ( TH). Affected individuals have consistently high TH levels and non-suppressed thyrotropin in the absence of acute illness , drugs , or alterations in TH binding proteins. Depending on the tissue , features of TH excess and deficiency may coexist , although most individuals have a euthyroid , normal metabolic state at the expense of high TH levels. In most cases the disorder is associated with germline mutations in the THRB gene. In the last decades , advances in genetics have expanded our knowledge on the etiology and pathophysiology of the syndrome<disease> and have shed more light on the molecular mechanisms of TH action. This review provides an update on the genetics of RTHβ , summarizes the clinical and biochemical presentation of the syndrome<disease> , and describes the methodology used to diagnose and manage individuals with RTHβ.
