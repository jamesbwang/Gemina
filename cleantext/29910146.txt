  Both myopathic and neuropathic tongue protruder muscle<symptom> changes<symptom> have been demonstrated to occur in obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) patients using different methods. We tried to elucidate this dilemma using quantitative electromyographic ( EMG) methods. In a group of consecutive patients with suspected OSA a full overnight polysomnography ( PSG) and quantitative needle EMG of the tongue protruder , biceps brachii and vastus lateralis muscles were performed. EMG findings were compared to control subjects. Of 23 patients , 8 were classified as simple snorers and the remaining 15 as OSA patients by PSG. Motor unit potential ( MUP) parameters obtained in tongue protruder muscles , but not biceps brachii or vastus lateralis muscles , were significantly larger in patients compared to controls. However , no correlation was found between tongue protruder muscle MUP parameters and patient characteristics. Our study confirmed previous findings of neuropathic changes in the tongue protruder muscles of OSA patients , and extended these to simple snorers. Changes were limited to the upper airway muscle , and could not been explained by the severity or duration of the sleep breathing disorder. The possible role of denervation injury caused by the upper airway vibrations should be tested in the future by appropriately designed studies.
