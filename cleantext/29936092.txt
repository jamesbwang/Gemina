  The use of hip arthroscopy as a treatment for femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI) has increased exponentially in recent years without robust evidence or consensus about the patients who benefit from it. To develop explicit criteria for the appropriate indication of hip arthroscopy in FAI. A panel of experts was formed with 11 traumatologists following the RAND/UCLA method to identify the appropriateness criteria for hip arthroscopy in patients with FAI. The panel made independent evaluations of each indication using a nine-point adequacy scale , then met face-to-face to vote using an iterative discussion process. The influence of the variables on the final score was studied using multinomial logistic regression models. The Classification and Regression Tree ( CART) analysis was used to summarize the results in the form of decision trees. Twenty-three point four percent of the 192 scenarios evaluated in the face-to-face meeting was considered appropriate ( 40 % agreement) , 26.6 % uncertain and 50 % inappropriate ( 75 % agreement). The most influential variables in considering the use of arthroscopy appropriate were: joint<symptom> symptoms<symptom> compatible with shock<symptom> test , duration of symptoms , functionality , age and Hip Outcome Score ( HOS) scale. We developed an explicit set of criteria for the appropriate use of hip arthroscopy in FAI using the RAND/UCLA method , providing a tool that would identify patients who are potential candidates for surgical treatment using arthroscopic hip surgery.
