  Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( DPPC) demonstrated complex differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) thermal behavior. Transitions below 100 °C showed variability in their thermotropic reversibility. An experimental design employing a DSC heat-cool-heat-cool-heat cycle and modulated DSC were used to gain insight into the DPPC 's complex thermal nature. An annealing strategy was developed to reduce DPPC 's thermotropic variability , moisture uptake rate , and rate variability. Samples annealed at 110 °C for 5 min provided a reproducible , thermally reversible material. The annealed material also exhibited an 8-fold decrease in moisture sorption rate and a statistically significant ( p = 0.0233) 100-fold decrease in water sorption rate variability compared to DPPC `` as is. '' An optimized validated stability-indicating high performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering detection method was developed and showed no change in DPPC chemical stability under the annealing treatment conditions.
