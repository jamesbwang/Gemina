  Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by osteoclast-mediated low bone mass. The modulation of osteoclasts is important for the prevention or therapeutic treatment of loss of bone mass. Osteoclasts , which are bone-resorbing multinucleated cells , are differentiated from the hematopoietic stem cell monocyte/macrophage lineage by Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( RANKL) expressed from osteoblasts and stromal cells. RANKL signaling ultimately activates nuclear factor of activated T Cells 1 ( NFATc1) , which is a master transcription factor in osteoclastogenesis. Betulin , a lupine type pentacyclic triterpenoid , was isolated from the bark of
