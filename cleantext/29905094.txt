  Clinical pathways are used to support the management of patients in emergency departments. An existing document-based clinical pathway was used as the foundation on which to design and build a digital clinical pathway for acute<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , with the aim of improving clinical calculations , clinician decision-making , documentation , and data collection. Established principles of decision support system design were used to build an application within the existing electronic health record , before testing with a multidisciplinary team of doctors using a think-aloud protocol. Technical authoring was successful , however , usability testing revealed that the user experience and the flexibility of workflow within the application were critical barriers to implementation. Emergency medicine and acute care decision support systems face particular challenges to existing models of linear workflow that should be deliberately addressed in digital pathway design. We make key recommendations regarding digital pathway design in emergency medicine.
