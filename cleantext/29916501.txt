  Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( SPIONs) have been developed as excellent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) contrast agents for stem cell labeling and tracking due to their biocompatibility. In this study , we designed a self-assembled peptide amphiphile ( PA) with potential use in tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. This PA was conjugated to the surfaces of SPIONs to label rat mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) , which enhanced their contrast and labeling efficiencies. Studies on the labeled cells showed that the peptide-SPIONs had improved internalization , efficiency and T2-weight relaxivity both in vivo and in vitro and were nontoxic to the MSCs. The results demonstrated that these self-assembled peptide-modified SPIONs are potential candidates to label MSCs for tracking stem cells using MRI in vivo.
