  Walking and cycling for transport ( active travel) is an important source of physical activity with established health benefits. However , levels of physical activity accrued during public transport journeys in England are unknown. Using the English National Travel Survey 2010-14 we quantified active travel as part of public transport journeys. Linear regression models compared levels of physical activity across public transport modes , and logistic regression models compared the odds of undertaking 30 min a day of physical activity. Public transport users accumulated 20.5 min ( 95 % confidence interval = 19.8 , 21.2) a day of physical activity as part of public transport journeys. Train users accumulated 28.1 min ( 26.3 , 30.0) with bus users 16.0 min ( 15.3 , 16.8). Overall , 34 % ( 32 % , 36 %) of public transport users achieved 30 min a day of physical activity in the course of their journeys; 21 % ( 19 % , 24 %) of bus users and 52 % ( 47 % , 56 %) of train users. Public transport use is an effective way to incorporate physical activity into daily life. One in three public transport users meet physical activity guidelines suggesting that shifts from sedentary travel modes to public transport could dramatically raise the proportion of populations achieving recommended levels of physical activity.
