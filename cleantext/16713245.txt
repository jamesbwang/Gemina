  We tested the hypothesis that arm/hand motor recovery after injury of the lateral sensorimotor cortex is associated with upregulation of the corticoreticular projection ( CRP) from the supplementary motor cortex ( M2) to the gigantocellular reticular nucleus of the medulla ( Gi). Three groups of rhesus monkeys of both genders were studied: five controls , four cases with lesions<symptom> of the arm/hand area of the primary motor cortex ( M1) and the lateral premotor cortex ( LPMC; F2 lesion<symptom> group) , and five cases with lesions<symptom> of the arm/hand area of M1 , LPMC , S1 , and anterior parietal cortex ( F2P2 lesion<symptom> group). CRP strength was assessed using high-resolution anterograde tracers injected into the arm/hand area of M2 and stereology to estimate of the number of synaptic boutons in the Gi. M2 projected bilaterally to the Gi , primarily targeting the medial Gi subsector and , to a lesser extent , lateral , dorsal , and ventral subsectors. Total CRP bouton numbers were similar in controls and F2 lesion<symptom> cases but F2P2 lesion<symptom> cases had twice as many boutons as the other two groups (
