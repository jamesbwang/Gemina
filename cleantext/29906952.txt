  We investigate the fluctuating motion of an aerosol particle falling in air. Using a Millikan-like setup , we tracked a 1-Î¼m sphere falling at its terminal velocity. We observe occurrences of particles undergoing upward displacements against the force of gravity , so that negative work is done briefly. These negative-work events have a probability that is shown to obey the work fluctuation theorem. This experimental confirmation of the theorem 's applicability to aerosols leads us to develop and demonstrate an application: an in situ measurement of an aerosol particle 's mass.
