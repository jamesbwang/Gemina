  Dual-labeled biomolecules constitute a new generation of bioconjugates with promising applications in therapy and diagnosis. Unfortunately , the development of these new families of biologics is hampered by the technical difficulties associated with their construction. In particular , the site specificity of the conjugation is critical as the number and position of payloads can have a dramatic impact on the pharmacokinetics of the bioconjugate. Herein , we introduce dichlorotetrazine as a trivalent platform for the selective double modification of proteins on cysteine residues. This strategy is applied to the dual labeling of albumin with a macrocyclic chelator for nuclear imaging and a fluorescent probe for fluorescence imaging.
