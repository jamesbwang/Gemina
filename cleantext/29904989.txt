  To examine psychosocial mediators of the effect of a culturally tailored dietary intervention on dietary change among Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors. Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors ( n = 70) were randomized to receive either a 12-week theory-based and culturally tailored dietary change program ( intervention group , n = 34) , or standard-of-care printed recommendations ( control group , n = 36) ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01414062). Fruit/vegetable intake ( F/V) , % calories from fat , and hypothesized psychosocial mediators were assessed at baseline , 6 and 12 months. Analysis of covariance assessed intervention effects on psychosocial mediators at 6 and 12 months. Mediation analysis using the bootstrap method evaluated the indirect intervention effects on dietary intake at 6 and 12 months through changes in psychosocial mediators at 6 and 12 months. Compared with controls , at 6 and 12 months , the intervention group reported greater improvements in stages of change ( P < .001 , P < .001 , respectively) , self-efficacy ( P = .009 , P = .002 , respectively) , snack preference for F/snack preference for F/V ( P = .045 , P = .002 , respectively); at 12 months , the intervention group reported a decrease in chance-oriented external locus of control ( P = .02). At 6 months , mediation analysis showed that the intervention effect was associated with an increase of 1.0 ( 95 % CI , -0.1-2.4) serving/day of F/V , compared with the control group , although no indirect effect through the hypothesized psychosocial mediators was observed. At 12 months , the intervention was associated with an increase in 0.5 serving/day F/V through improved taste/snack preference for F/V at 6 and 12 months ( 95 % CIs , 0.1-1.3 , 0.0-1.4 , respectively). Future programs can target improving taste/snack preference for F/V to promote dietary change in Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors.
