  Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by recurrent episodes of demyelination and loss of oligodendrocytes. The demyelination process is caused by various subsets of CD4 + T cells with a Th1 and Th17 phenotype. The retinoid acid-related orphan receptor A ( RORA) is expressed in Th17 cells and promote Th17 differentiation. In this study , we compared the expression level of RORA gene in the blood of 50 relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS) patients who were treated with IFN-β and 50 healthy controls by TaqMan Quantitative Real-Time PCR.We found that RORA expression was significantly down-regulated in MS patients compared with controls ( P = 0.006). However , there was no significant correlation between RORA gene expression and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS). Our findings suggest a possible contribution of IFN-β in the downregulation of RORA. In addition , RORA downregulation may be a potential indicator of positive response to interferon beta treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
