  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is a multicomponent disorder characterized by inflammation<symptom> , representing a significant leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality. Reports have implicated hydrogen sulfide ( H Rat models of COPD were successfully established by means of passive smoke exposure and intratracheal injection with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS). Pulmonary function tests were performed and histopathological changes were observed. The expression of ERS markers , glucose-regulated protein-78 ( GRP78) , and C/EBP homologous protein ( CHOP) and caspase-12 , associated with ERS-induced apoptosis , were determined by western blot and immunohistochemistry methods. TUNEL assay was applied to determine the apoptosis index ( AI) in PAECs. Treatment with NaHS was followed by the exhibition of markedly increased forced expiratory volume over 0.3 s ( FEV0 .3)/ forced vital capacity ( FVC) and dynamic lung compliance as well as integral optical density ( IOD) , with decreased RI among COPD rats. Western blot analysis , immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay results revealed there to be reduced expressions of GRP78 , CHOP and caspase-12 in the lung tissues and AI of PAECs , post NaHS treatment. The key findings of the current study highlight ERS in COPD rats , as well as well as reduced apoptosis in PAECs in connection with exogenous H
