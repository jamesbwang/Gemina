  This study evaluated the effects of di- ( 2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP) and obesity on male reproductive organ function in male mice and the potential mechanism of male secondary hypogonadism ( SH) in such mice. 140 mice were assigned to six groups for 12 weeks: normal , DEHP , DIO , DIO + DEHP low , DIO + DEHP middle , and DIO + DEHP high. The effects of DEHP and obesity upon the reproductive organs were determined by measuring sperm count and motility , relative testis and epididymis weight , hormone level , and pathological changes. Oxidative stress was evaluated by determining malondialdehyde , T-AOC , SOD , GSH , H DEHP and obesity reduced sperm count and motility , relative testis and epididymis weight , and testosterone level but increased the levels of MDA , H DEHP and obesity jointly caused damage to male productive function. Oxidative stress in testicular tissue , and a high level of leptin , may provide some evidence to clarify the mechanisms of male SH with DEHP and obesity.
