  Recently , the effects of stem cell supernatants or exosomes , such as skin wounds<disease> , have attracted attention. However , the effects of the induced pluripotent stem ( iPS) cell-derived exosomes ( iPS-Exos) have not been investigated in detail. Here , we investigated the effects of iPS-Exos on skin wound<disease> healing using an animal model. We isolated iPS-Exos from the iPS cell culture media. Control exosomes were isolated from unused iPS cell culture media ( M-Exos). We first observed the morphologic characteristics of the isolated exosomes and examined the expression of surface antigens. The effects of these exosomes on the migratory response and proliferation of fibroblasts were analyzed as well. Additionally , using a diabetic ulcer<disease> model , the effects of iPS-Exos and M-Exos on skin wound<disease> healing were investigated. Transmission electron microscope analysis demonstrated that the size of iPS-Exos ( 120 ± 25 nm) was significantly larger than that of M-Exos ( ≤ 100 nm). Flow cytometry analyses showed that iPS-Exos were positive for CD9 , CD63 , and CD81 , whereas they were negative for HLA-ABC and- DR expression. The migratory ability of fibroblasts cocultured with iPS-Exos was shown to be higher than that of the cells cocultured with M-Exos , as demonstrated using scratch assay. Skin wound<disease> healing model results showed that the administration of iPS-Exos results in a faster wound<disease> closure compared with that observed in the M-Exo group. In conclusion , the results obtained here indicate that iPS-Exos may promote the migration of fibroblasts
