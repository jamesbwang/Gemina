  As many devices for human utility aim for fast and convenient communication with users , superb electronic devices are demonstrated to serve as hardware for human-machine interfaces in wearable forms. Wearable devices for daily healthcare and self-diagnosis offer more human-like properties unconstrained by deformation. In this sense , stretchable ionics based on flexible and stretchable hydrogels are on the rise as another means to develop wearable devices for bioapplications for two main reasons: i) ionic currents and choosing the same signal carriers for biological areas , and ii) the adoption of hydrogel ionic conductors , which are intrinsically stretchable materials with biocompatibility. Here , the current status of stretchable ionics and future applications are introduced , whose positive effects can be magnified by stretchable ionics.
