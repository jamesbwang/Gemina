  Itch , also referred to as pruritus , is an unpleasant cutaneous sensation provoking the desire to scratch. It is often an uncomfortable , subjective sensation responsible for decreased quality of life in a variety of psychodermatological conditions. Comorbid psychiatric conditions , including depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> , are frequently associated with itch and scratch cycle. The reciprocal and intricate relationship between the psyche and itch has been widely studied. The neurobiology of itch involves the complexity of specific mediators , itch-related neuronal pathways , and central processing of itch. The connection between itch and the psyche can be grouped under three headings: pruritic diseases with psychosocial sequelae , pruritic diseases aggravated by psychosocial factors , and psychiatric disorders causing pruritus. Itch and pain modulation go together in most circumstances and involve various substances including histamine , interleukins , protease-activated receptors , transient receptor potential receptors , opioids , and cannabinoids. The close interaction between keratinocytes and nerve endings modulating pain and itch also play a major role. Management of itch associated with its psychosomatic components is directed at an underlying cause and adopting a holistic approach to address not only dermatologic and somatosensory aspects , but also the cognitive , emotional , and psychosocial components. An integrated multidisciplinary team consisting of a dermatologist , psychiatrist , psychologist , and social worker is vital in addressing the multifaceted aspects of pruritus.
