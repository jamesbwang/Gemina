  Yes-associated protein ( Yap) was the core transcriptional co-activator in the downstream Hippo pathway that regulated cell proliferation and tissue growth. However , its role in the regulation of myoblast differentiation remains unclear. Regulation of mitochondrial networks by dynamin-related protein 1 ( Drp1) and mitofusion 2 ( Mfn2) is crucial for the activation of myoblast differentiation. In the present study , we investigated the interplay between the Hippo-Yap pathway and protein contents of Mfn2 and Drp1 during myoblast differentiation. The Hippo-Yap pathway was inactivated at the early stage of myoblast differentiation due to the decreased ratio of phosphorylated mammalian sterile 20 kinases 1/2 ( p-Mst1/ 2)/ Mst1/2 , phosphorylated large tumor suppressor 1 ( p-Lats1)/ Lats1 and phosphorylated Yap ( serine 112 , p-Yap S112)/ Yap , which resulted in the translocation of Yap from cytoplasm to nucleus , increased protein content of Drp1 and mitochondrial fission events. Downregulation of Yap inhibited myoblast differentiation and decreased the content of Drp1 , which resulted in elongated mitochondria , fused mitochondrial networks and collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP). Together , our data indicate that inactivation of the Hippo-Yap pathway could induce mitochondrial fission by promoting Drp1 content at the early stage of myoblast differentiation.
