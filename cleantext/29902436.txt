  Food is a primordial need for our survival and well-being. However , diet is not only essential to maintain human growth , reproduction , and health , but it also modulates and supports the symbiotic microbial communities that colonize the digestive tract-the gut microbiota. Type , quality , and origin of our food shape our gut microbes and affect their composition and function , impacting host-microbe interactions. In this review , we will focus on dietary fibers , which interact directly with gut microbes and lead to the production of key metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids , and discuss how dietary fiber impacts gut microbial ecology , host physiology , and health. Hippocrates ' notion `` Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food '' remains highly relevant millennia later , but requires consideration of how diet can be used for modulation of gut microbial ecology to promote health.
