  On 11 January 1922 insulin injection was used for the first time in the treatment of diabetes. Even today , daily insulin injections are the life-saving treatment for patients with Type 1 diabetes and advanced Type 2 diabetes. However , insulin injections often fail to achieve full glucose control , which in the long-term leads to multiple complications and mortality. Beta-cells , the natural producers and secretors of insulin , remain the gold-standard in regulating blood glucose levels. In this review , we focus on three strategies aiming at counteracting beta-cell loss in order to gain insulin independence: replacement , replication and protection. The three approaches , together termed as the triumvirate of beta-cell regeneration , may constitute the basis for a future cure for diabetes.
