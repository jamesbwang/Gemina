  Recently , increasing studies showed that long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) play critical roles in tumor progression. However , the function and underlying mechanism of HOMEOBOX A11 antisense RNA ( HOXA11-AS) on renal cancer remain unclear. In the current study , our data showed that the expression of HOXA11-AS was significantly upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC) tissues and cell lines. High HOXA11-AS expression was associated with the advanced clinical stage , tumor stage , and lymph node metastasis. Function assays showed that HOXA11-AS inhibition significantly suppressed renal cancer cells growth , invasion , and ETM phenotype. In addition , underlying mechanism revealed that HOXA11-AS could act as a competing endogenous RNA ( ceRNA) that repressed miR-146b-5p expression , which regulated its downstream target MMP16 in renal cancer. Taken together , our findings suggested that HOXA11-AS could promote renal cancer cells growth and invasion by modulating miR-146b-5p-MMP16 axis. Thus , our findings suggested that HOXA11-AS could serve as potential therapeutic target for the treatment of renal cancer.
