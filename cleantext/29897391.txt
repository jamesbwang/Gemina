  To review the clinicopathologic features of five patients with epithelioid trophoblastic tumor ( ETT). Characteristics of patients diagnosed with ETT in 2000 to 2012 were reviewed. Among 190 patients with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia ( GTN) , two had pure ETT and three had mixed ETT and choriocarcinoma. The median age was 32.5 years. All the patients had localized disease in the uterus. One patient with pure ETT had a recurrence in the ureter 6 years after the initial treatment. Another patient with pure ETT had two full-term deliveries after fertility-sparing surgery. The three patients with mixed tumors had chemotherapy for GTN before their diseases were completely treated by hysterectomy. At a median follow-up of 102 months , all patients survived. ETT is indolent. Recurrence can happen , but the risk factors are not clear. When patients with GTN fail to respond to chemotherapy , the possibility of mixed GTN should be considered.
