  The demand for a harmless noncontact trapping and transportation method in manipulation and measurement of biological micro objects waits to be met. In this paper , a novel micromanipulation method named & ldquo; Hydrodynamic Tweezers & rdquo; using the vortex induced by oscillating a single piezoelectric actuator is introduced. The piezoelectric actuator is set between a micropipette and a copper beam. Oscillating the actuator at a certain frequency causes the resonance of the copper beam and extend 1D straight oscillation of the piezoelectric actuator to 2D circular oscillation of the micropipette , which induces a micro vortex after putting the micropipette into fluid. The induced vortex featuring low<symptom> pressure<symptom> in its core area can trap the object nearby. A robotic micromanipulator is utilized to transport the trapped objects together with the micropipette. Experiments of trapping and transportation microbeads are carried out to characterize the key parameters. The results show that the trapping force can be controlled by adjusting peak-peak voltage of the sinusoidal voltage input into the piezoelectric actuator.
