  The aim of the present study was to establish a recurrent convulsion<symptom> model during the developmental stage using inhalation of flurothyl , and to observe the relationship between the changes in mitochondrial function in hippocampal neurons and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis after recurrent convulsion<symptom>. A total of 36 Sprague-Dawley male rats were selected and randomly divided into the control ( NS) group and recurrent-seizure ( RS) group for 0 , 1.5 , 3 , 12 and 24 h. After the last seizure<symptom> the rats were subdivided with 6 animals in each group. Rats in the seizure<symptom> group inhaled flurothyl repeatedly to induce status convulsivus , 30 min once daily , for 7 consecutive days , while the same operation was conducted in the control group without inhalation of flurothyl. At each time-point after the last seizure<symptom> , blood was taken from the heart , followed by decapitation and immediate removal of the brain. Half of the brain tissue was immediately fixed in 10 % paraformaldehyde to prepare paraffin-embedded tissues for hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E) histological staining. Hippocampus was taken from the other half of the brain and stored at -80 °C. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential ( ΔΨm) in hippocampal neurons were detected by flow cytometer. Dynamic changes of mitochondrial fusion and division-related genes , mitochondrial fusion protein 2 ( Mfn2) and dynamin-related protein 1 ( Drp1) , in the hippocampus after recurrent convulsion<symptom> were observed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) and western blot analysis. The expression of caspase-3 and cytochrome
