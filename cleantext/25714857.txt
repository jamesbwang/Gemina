  Si-H bond activation is an important process implicated in many useful synthetic applications including silylation and transfer hydrogenation reactions. Herein we discovered homolytic activation of Si-H bonds on the surface of nanoporous gold ( NPG) , forming hydrogen radicals and ( Au)- ( Si) intermediates. By virtue of this new reactivity , we achieved highly selective mono and sequential alcoholysis of dihydrosilane. In addition , the amphiphilic nature of the ( Au)- ( Si) intermediate allows for a new bis-silylation reaction of cyclic ethers. The present work showcased that the surface reactivity of nanocatalysts may provide exciting opportunity for new reaction discovery.
