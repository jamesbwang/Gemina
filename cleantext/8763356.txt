  Monogamy is associated with sibling-directed altruism in multiple animal taxa , including insects , birds and mammals. Inclusive-fitness theory readily explains this pattern by identifying high relatedness as a promoter of altruism. In keeping with this prediction , monogamy should promote the evolution of voluntary sterility in insect societies if sterile workers make for better helpers. However , a recent mathematical population-genetics analysis failed to identify a consistent effect of monogamy on voluntary worker sterility. Here , we revisit that analysis. First , we relax genetic assumptions , considering not only alleles of extreme effect-encoding either no sterility or complete sterility-but also alleles with intermediate effects on worker sterility. Second , we broaden the stability analysis-which focused on the invasibility of populations where either all workers are fully sterile or all workers are fully reproductive-to identify where intermediate pure or mixed evolutionarily stable states may occur. Third , we consider a broader range of demographically explicit ecological scenarios relevant to altruistic worker non-reproduction and to the evolution of eusociality more generally. We find that , in the absence of genetic constraints , monogamy always promotes altruistic worker sterility and may inhibit spiteful worker sterility. Our extended analysis demonstrates that an exact population-genetics approach strongly supports the prediction of inclusive-fitness theory that monogamy promotes sib-directed altruism in social insects.
