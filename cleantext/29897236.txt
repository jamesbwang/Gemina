  The 20S proteasome is the main protease that directly targets intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs) for proteolytic degradation. Mutations , oxidative stress , or aging can induce the buildup of IDPs resulting in incorrect signaling or aggregation , associated with the pathogenesis of many cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Drugs that facilitate 20S-mediated proteolysis therefore have many potential therapeutic applications. We report herein the modulation of proteasome assembly by the small molecule TCH-165 , resulting in an increase in 20S levels. The increase in the level of free 20S corresponds to enhanced proteolysis of IDPs , including Î±-synuclein , tau , ornithine<disease> decarboxylase , and c-Fos , but not structured proteins. Clearance of ubiquitinated protein was largely maintained by single capped proteasome complexes ( 19S-20S) , but accumulation occurs when all 19S capped proteasome complexes are depleted. This study illustrates the first example of a small molecule capable of targeting disordered proteins for degradation by regulating the dynamic equilibrium between different proteasome complexes.
