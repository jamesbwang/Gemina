  Long-distance dispersal is believed to strongly influence coral reef population dynamics across the Tropical Pacific. However , the spatial scale and strength at which populations are potentially connected by dispersal remains uncertain. To determine the patterns in connectivity between the Eastern<disease> ( ETP) and Central Tropical Pacific ( CTP) ecoregions , we used a biophysical model incorporating ocean currents and larval biology to quantify the seascape-wide dispersal potential among all population. We quantified the likelihood and determined the oceanographic conditions that enable the dispersal of coral larvae across the Eastern<disease> Pacific Barrier ( EP-Barrier) and identified the main connectivity pathways and their conservation value for dominant reef-building corals. Overall , we found that coral assemblages within the CTP and ETP are weakly connected through dispersal. Although the EP-Barrier isolates the ETP from the CTP ecoregion , we found evidence that the EP-Barrier may be breached , in both directions , by rare dispersal events. These rare events could explain the evolutionary genetic similarity among populations of pocilloporids in the ecoregions. Moreover , the ETP may function as a stronger source rather than a destination , providing potential recruits to CTP populations. We also show evidence for a connectivity loop in the ETP , which may positively influence long-term population persistence in the region. Coral conservation and management communities should consider eight-key stepping stone ecoregions when developing strategies to preserve the long-distance connectivity potential across the ETP and CTP.
