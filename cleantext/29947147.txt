  Antibody-mediated rejection is responsible for 30 % -50 % of renal graft failures. Differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing plasmablasts depends on the collaboration of follicular helper T cells ( Tfh). We analyzed circulating Tfh ( cTfh) in kidney recipients and studied cTfh relationship with anti-HLA antibody production and graft outcome. cTfh were longitudinally analyzed in a prospective cohort of patients ( n = 206) , pre- and posttransplantation. Clinical data , HLA sensitization , and cTfh function were recorded. Both pretransplant and 6-month posttransplant cTfh were able to derive IgG-producing plasmablasts. Pretransplant cTfh was decreased in patients , especially in those who received dialysis. However , these cells were increased in patients with previous allograft or transfusions and in HLA-sensitized recipients. After transplantation cTfh expanded , significantly more in patients who developed de novo anti-HLA antibodies than in patients who remained unsensitized. Augmented pretransplant cTfh positively correlated with higher intensity of pretransplant anti-HLA class I and with de novo anti-HLA class I and anti-HLA class II antibodies. Consistently , pretransplantation cTfh were higher in patients who experienced acute rejection ( HR = 1.14 ( 1.04-1.25)). Thus , we show a role for Tfh in anti-HLA sensitization and rejection. Multicenter studies with additional patient cohorts are needed to validate these results. Immunosuppressive drugs targeting Tfh could be useful to improve outcomes.
