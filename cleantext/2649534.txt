  Spontaneous reperfusion ( SR) and early infarct related artery ( IRA) patency before primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI) might bring extra benefit for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI). This study premilinarily screened the independent predictors of SR , and assessed the relationship between SR and plasma homocysteine ( HCY). The medical records of 998 patients who were diagnosed as STEMI and underwent emergency coronary angiography were retrospectively studied , SR was defined as achievement of TIMI grade 3 flow in the IRA before PCI. The baseline characteristics , clinical manifestations and hematological variables were compared between SR and NSR group. Optimal cutoff point of HCY was calculated with receiving operating characteristics ( ROC) analysis , multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of SR. 229 ( 22.95 %) patients showed angiographic SR.. For HCY , the area under the curve was 0.70 ( 95 % CI: 0.63-0.77 , P = 0.034) , the optimized cut off point was 17.55 μmol/L. Preinfarct angina ( 95 % CI: 1.61-5.65 , P = 0.0005) , plasma C-reactive protein ( CRP) level ( 95 % CI: 0.87-0.99 , P = 0.016) and HCY < 17.55 μmol/L ( 95 % CI: 2.43-8.72 , P < 0.0001) were found to be independent predictors for SR.. In patients with STEMI , HCY < 17.55 μmol/L , preinfarct angina and plasma CRP level were independent predictors of SR..
