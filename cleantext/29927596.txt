  Quantifying ion association and collective dynamical processes in organic electrolytes is essential for fundamental property interpretation and optimization for electrochemical applications. The extent of ion correlation depends on both the ion concentration and dielectric strength of the solvent; ions may be largely uncorrelated in sufficiently high-dielectric solvents at low concentration , but properties of concentrated electrolytes are dictated by correlated and collective ion processes. In this work , we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to characterize ion association and collective ion dynamics in organic electrolytes composed of binary mixtures of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ( BMIM
