  The exact cause of preeclampsia remains unknown. The past decade has seen an ongoing debate on the relative importance of primipaternity versus prolonged birth/pregnancy interval. The aim of the current study was to analyze these two major potential risk factors in a high risk population in the Northern suburbs of Adelaide; a socioeconomically disadvantaged area characterized by instable relationships and overall poor health and lifestyle. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all multigravid women birthing at the Lyell McEwin Hospital , Adelaide , from July 2011 to August 2012; 2003 patients were included in this analysis. Basic demographic data , previous pregnancy outcomes , paternity , and birth and pregnancy intervals were recorded. Women with a previously normal pregnancy had a significantly increased risk of developing preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancy with a new paternity ( OR 2.27 ( p = 0.015)). Increasing birth and pregnancy intervals were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing preeclampsia in later pregnancies , with or 1.39 at 3 years ( p = 0.042) and or 2.05 at 4 years ( p = 0.002). The results of this study indicate that both prolonged birth interval and primipaternity are independent risk factors for preeclampsia in multigravidae.
