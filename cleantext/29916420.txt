  The purpose of this paper is to present two studies. Study 1 is a literature review on psychological needs of malignant mesothelioma ( MM) patients. Study 2 is aimed at assessing how patients and caregiver experience the diagnosis. In study 1 we performed a systematic literature review; while in study 2 we performed a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. Study 1 detected 5 psychological constructs ( i.e. 1. Psychological impact of MM diagnosis; 2. Emotional aspects connected to the occupational context; 3. Coping strategies; 4. Treatment experiences; 5. Quality of life). Study 2 identified 4 themes ( i.e. 1. Physical symptoms , affects , and defenses; 2. Living in or near a National Priority Contaminated Site; 3. `` Nothing is like it was ''; 4. `` What will become of us? ''). The literature review suggests a specific profile of suffering for MM , a result strengthened by the qualitative study on semi-structured interviews. The present paper highlights the lack of specific measures and clinical interventions for this distinctive population.
