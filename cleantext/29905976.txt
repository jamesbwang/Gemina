  Rolapitant is a selective and long-acting neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist approved in an oral formulation in combination with dexamethasone and a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonist for the prevention of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> in adults. The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of intravenous ( IV) rolapitant were evaluated in two open-label , phase 1 trials in healthy subjects. Single ascending dose ( SAD) and multiple ascending dose studies were conducted in one trial ( PR-11-5012-C) , and a supratherapeutic SAD study was conducted in a separate trial ( PR-11-5022-C). In the SAD and supratherapeutic studies , rolapitant maximum plasma concentration , area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve ( AUC) from time zero to time of last measured concentration , and AUC from time zero to infinity increased dose-proportionally following single IV infusions of 18 to 270 mg. In the multiple ascending dose study , following 10 daily IV infusions of rolapitant 18 , 36 , or 54 mg , the mean day 10: day 1 maximum concentration ratio was 1.97 , 1.52 , and 2.07 , respectively , and the mean day 10: day 1 ratio of AUC from 0 to 24 hours was 4.30 , 4.59 , and 5.38 , respectively , indicating drug accumulation over time. Across all studies , rolapitant was gradually eliminated from plasma , with a half-life of 135-231 hours. Rolapitant was safe and well tolerated across all studies , with no serious or severe rolapitant-related treatment-emergent adverse events. The most common rolapitant-related treatment-emergent adverse events were headache<symptom> , dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> , and dizziness<symptom> , which were predominantly mild in severity. Overall , the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of IV rolapitant were consistent with those of the oral formulation.
