  Nanoscale extracellular vesicles ( EVs) including exosomes ( 50-150 nm membrane particles) have emerged as promising cancer biomarkers due to the carried genetic information about the parental cells. However the sensitive detection of these vesicles remains a challenge. Here we present a label-free electrochemical sensor to measure the EVs secretion levels of hypoxic and normoxic MCF-7 cells. The sensor design includes two consecutive steps; i) Au electrode surface functionalization for anti-CD81 Antibody and ii) EVs capture. The label-free detection of EVs was done via Differential Pulse Voltammetry ( DPV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy ( EIS). The working linear range for the sensor was 10
