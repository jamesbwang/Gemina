  Chagas disease , caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi , is considered to be a multifactorial disease associated with host and parasite genetics , which influence clinical aspects of the disease and other host conditions. In order to understand better the evolution of the disease , this study intended to evaluation of parasite and host genetics in two generations of a family with Chagas disease from the Alto Paranaiba region , Minas Gerais , Brazil , comprising a mother and her five daughters. Several features were evaluated , including the characterization of T. cruzi directly from the blood of patients , host polymorphisms of genes related to cardiomyopathy ( TNF , WISP1 , CCR5 , and TGF-β1) and clinical aspects of the patients. To verify the intraspecific variability of the parasite , the characterization was done directly from human blood using the PCR-LSSP technique and analyzed based on Dice coefficient and unweighted pair group analysis ( UPGMA). The host polymorphism was evaluated by PCR-RFLP. The global results showed low variability of the parasites characterized from blood of patients , through Shannon index ( 0.492) and mean heterozygosity value per locus ( 0.322). All six patients presented the same genetic polymorphism profile for TNF , WISP1 , and TGF-β1 , and only one patient was homozygous to CCR5 , which suggests that there is no association between the clinical aspects of the patients and their genetic profiles. In conclusion , the findings confirm that the understanding of the clinical evolution of Chagas disease goes beyond the genetic aspects of the parasite and the host.
