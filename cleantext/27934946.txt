  Maintaining North Atlantic ( NA) intra-basin near-surface salinity ( NSS) contrast between the high NSS ( > 37.0) in the subtropical NA ( STNA) and low NSS ( < 35.0) in the subpolar NA ( SPNA) has been shown to be important in sustaining the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Evaporation ( E) exceeding precipitation ( P) in the STNA is primarily responsible for the high NSS there , whereas P dominating E in the SPNA contributes to its low NSS. With a basic understanding of NA intra-basin moisture transport , a correlation analysis was conducted between E-P/NSS over the NA subpolar gyre ( SPG) and E-P across the rest of the NA over the 1985-2012 time period. Significant anti-correlations exist between E-P/NSS over the NA SPG and E-P over the central/northern STNA. This suggests that during times of high E over the central/northern STNA there is high ( low) precipitation ( NSS) over the SPG demonstrating a relationship likely exists between E over the STNA and NSS over the SPG. The maximum anti-correlated area is poleward of the maximum E-P location in the STNA , which is examined. These results provide a first step to ultimately utilizing NSS in the NA as a proxy for estimating changes in the hydrological cycle.
