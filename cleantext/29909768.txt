  Psychotherapy of psychotic disorders Abstract. The efficacy of psychotherapy for individuals with psychotic disorders is well documented and its implementation is recommended by international guidelines. Goals of psychotherapeutic interventions are reduction of symptoms , prevention of relapse , improvement of cognitive , emotional and social functioning , social integration and participation , and enhancement of quality of life as well as self-perception. Cognitive-behavioral and family interventions , cognitive and social trainings as well as psychoeducation are particularly recommended according to the literature. Fundamental factors for a favorable treatment result are a profound therapeutic relationship , a therapeutic setting according to patients ' needs , and a specific coordination with other interventions within the individual treatment concept. The implementation of evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions for individuals with psychotic disorders in clinical routine practice seems to be most challenging for future mental health service organization and research.
