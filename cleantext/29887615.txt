  To investigate potential risk factors of leukaemia. This case-control study was conducted in 5 hospitals in the province of Punjab , Pakistan , from May to September 2014 , and comprised adult leukaemia patients and healthy controls with similar gender and marital status , and children patients and healthy controls with matching age and gender. Interviews were carried out face-to-face with adults and with the parents of the minors to obtain information on family history , lifestyle risk factors , employment history , residential history , trauma history and occupational and non-occupational exposures by using a close-ended questionnaire. Data was analysed using SPSS 16. Of the 75 adults , 25 ( 33.3 %) were patients and 50 ( 66.6 %) were controls , while of the 120 children , 40 ( 33.3 %) were patients and 80 ( 66.6 %) were controls. Among adults those at risk of leukaemia had exposure to chemical factory ( p < 0.05) , positive family history of leukaemia ( p < 0.006) , positive trauma history ( p < 0.004) , those who dyed hair ( p < 0.003) , smokers ( p < 0.054) were born 1st or 4th among their siblings ( p < 0.037) , lived near crops ( p < 0.069) , worked in oil-refining factory ( p < 0.12) , or spent more than 7 hours under direct sunlight ( p < 0.002). Among children subjects those at a greater risk of leukaemia had a positive trauma history ( p < 0.000) who were born 1stor 4th among their siblings ( p < 0.028) , and had a positive family history of leukaemia ( p < 0.0484). Knowledge of particular risk factors can help plan and execute safety measures to reduce potentially harmful exposures and decrease risk of leukaemia.
