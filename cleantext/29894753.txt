  Temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE) is the most common type of epilepsy and is often medically refractory. Previous studies suggest that selective pharmaco-genetic inhibition of pyramidal neurons has therapeutic value for the treatment of epilepsy , however there is a risk of disrupting normal physical functions. Here , we test whether pharmaco-genetic activation of parvalbumin neurons , which are transgenetically transduced with the modified muscarinic receptor hM3Dq can attenuate TLE. We found that pharmaco-genetic activation of hippocampal parvalbumin neurons in epileptogenic zone not only significantly extends the latency to different seizure<symptom> stages and attenuates seizure<symptom> activities in acute<symptom> seizure<symptom> model , but also greatly alleviates the severity of seizure<symptom> onsets<symptom> in two chronic epilepsy models. This manipulation did not affect the normal physical function evaluated in various cognitive tasks. Further , the activation of parvalbumin neurons produced an inhibition on parts of surrounding pyramidal neurons , and the direct inactivation of pyramidal neurons via the viral expression of a modified muscarinic receptor hM4Di produced a similar anti-ictogenic effect. Interestingly , pharmaco-genetic inactivation of pyramidal neurons was more sensitive to impair cognitive function. Those data demonstrated that pharmaco-genetic seizure<symptom> attenuation through targeting parvalbumin neurons rather than pyramidal neurons may be a novel and relatively safe approach for treating refractory TLE.
