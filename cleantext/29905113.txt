  It is well established in the working memory literature , that performance can be improved by cueing attention toward the position of a to-be-tested item , even after that item 's presentation. This retro-cue benefit is often characterized as the joint outcome of two different effects: facilitation of recall and memory strengthening at the cued position. While the latter has been mainly explained by increased context-content binding , competing hypotheses exist to explain the facilitation of recall. The present study focuses on two of these hypotheses: the removal of non-cued information and the protection of cued information against interference. I replicate the retro-cue effect for verbal material and provide strong evidence for its protective effect. However , I did not find support for the removal hypothesis. This lack of support follows from two empirical findings: Retro-cueing does not decrease , rather increases the conditional probability of intrusions , and the retro-cue benefit does not interact with memory load.
