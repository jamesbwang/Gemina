  Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> is a nonfermenting Gram-negative bacillus<pathogen>. A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> resistance is a significant obstacle to clinical infection treatment. The existence of persister cells ( persisters) might represent the reason for therapy failure and relapse , and such cells may be the driving force behind rising resistance rates. In this study , A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> ATCC 19606 was used as a target to explore the essential features of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> persisters. Antibiotic treatment of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> cultures at 50-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration resulted in a distinct plateau of surviving drug-tolerant persisters. The sensitive bacteria were lysed with ceftazidime , and the nonreplicating bacteria were isolated for transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. We analyzed the transcriptome of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> persisters and identified significantly differentially expressed genes , as well as their enriched pathways. The results showed that both the GP49 ( HigB)/ Cro ( HigA) and DUF1044/RelB toxin/antitoxin systems were significantly increased during the persister incubation period. In addition , the activities of certain metabolic pathways ( such as electron transport , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) , and the citrate cycle) decreased sharply after antibiotic treatment and remained low during the persister period , while aromatic compound degradation genes were only upregulated in persisters. These results suggest the involvement of aromatic compound degradation genes in persister formation and maintenance. They further provide the first insight into the mechanism of persister formation in
