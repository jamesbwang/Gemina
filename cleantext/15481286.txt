  Inhaled medication is central to the treatment of COPD. Various types of inhaler devices , which directly deliver medication to the lung , have been developed. However , patients often exhibit incorrect techniques of inhaler usage. Effectiveness of therapy may be affected by the ease of device usage , size , convenience of use , durability , clarity of instructions and device preferences of patients. This study compares the satisfaction and preference , as well as error occurrence , with the use of Genuair One hundred and thirty healthy Hong Kong Chinese subjects aged â‰¥ 40 years without a previous diagnosis of COPD and asthma and with no experience of using dry powder inhalers ( DPIs) were recruited. Subjects learned to use the three DPIs by initially reading the instructions and then observing a demonstration with verbal explanation. The number of errors committed was evaluated. Subjects also completed a questionnaire to indicate their satisfaction and preference. The satisfaction score of comfort for Breezhaler was significantly higher than that for Ellipta ( Breezhaler seemed to be more comfortable and easy to carry , but users made less critical errors when using Ellipta after reading the instructions only. Genuair provided the clearest indication of correct dose preparation and inhalation.
