  To explore the effects of physical exercise on the liver of animals in menopause , we analyzed the histomorphometric parameters of the hepatic tissue in ovariectomized and dyslipidemic female mice. The animals were distributed in six groups ( n = 5): sedentary control ( SC) , sedentary ovariectomized control ( SOC) , trained ovariectomized control ( TOC) , sedentary LDL knockout ( LDL-S) , sedentary ovariectomized LDL knockout ( LDL-SO) , and trained ovariectomized LDL knockout ( LDL-TO). At the end of the experiment , the liver and the visceral adipose tissue ( VAT) of animals were removed for morphometric and stereological studies. In the LDL-S and LDL-SO animals , both sedentary , results showed reduction in the area ( Âµm
