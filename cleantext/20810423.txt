  Correct chromosomal segregation , coordinated with cell division , is crucial for bacterial survival , but despite extensive studies , the mechanisms underlying this remain incompletely understood in mycobacteria. We report a detailed investigation of the dynamic interactions between ParA and ParB partitioning proteins in Mycobacterium<pathogen> smegmatis<pathogen> using microfluidics and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to observe both proteins simultaneously. During growth and division , ParB presents as a focused fluorescent spot that subsequently splits in two. One focus moves towards a higher concentration of ParA at the new pole , while the other moves towards the old pole. We show ParB movement is in part an active process that does not rely on passive movement associated with cell growth. In some cells , another round of ParB segregation starts before cell division is complete , consistent with initiation of a second round of chromosome replication. ParA fluorescence distribution correlates with cell size , and in sister cells , the larger cell inherits a local peak of concentrated ParA , while the smaller sister inherits more homogeneously distributed protein. Cells which inherit more ParA grow faster than their sister cell , raising the question of whether inheritance of a local concentration of ParA provides a growth advantage. Alterations in levels of ParA and ParB were also found to disturb cell growth.
