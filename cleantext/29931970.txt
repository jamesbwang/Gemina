  The extracellular matrix of a tissue is as important to life as the cells within it. Its detailed molecular structure defines the environment of a tissue 's cells and thus their properties , including differentiation and metabolic status. Collagen proteins are the major component of extracellular matrices. Self-assembled collagen fibrils provide both specific mechanical properties to handle external stresses on tissues and , at the molecular level , well-defined protein binding sites to interact with cells. How the cell-matrix interactions are maintained against the stresses on the tissue is an important and as yet unanswered question. Similarly , how collagen molecular and fibrillar structures change in aging and disease is a crucial open question. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy offers insight into collagen molecular conformation in intact in vivo and in vitro tissues , and in this Account we review how NMR spectroscopy is beginning to provide answers to these questions.
