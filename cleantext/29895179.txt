  This article explores some core findings from a qualitative investigation of parents ' experiences of their child 's treatment in an adolescent mental health service in Sydney , Australia. In particular , the research question was , `` How does parents ' involvement in the child/adolescent 's treatment influence their perception of how they can be helpful in their child 's recovery? '' The theme of parent hope emerged from the broad qualitative exploration of parent 's experience of their involvement in their adolescent 's intensive treatment program. A purposive sample of 14 sets of parents participated , being interviewed at admission , discharge , and 6 months following their adolescent 's discharge. A continuum of high , moderate , and low levels of hope were evident in this parent sample 6 months after their treatment involvement. The strongly emergent theme was the relationship between parents ' hope and agency/self-efficacy. Parents who remained more passive in expecting expert helpers to fix their child experienced reduced hope months after finishing the program. When parents positively changed their interaction with their child , they felt a more sustained hopefulness. These findings generate the hypothesis that if parents are actively involved in changing themselves as part of their child 's treatment , they experience increased hope and effectiveness in contributing to their child 's recovery.
