  Inflammation<symptom> and extracellular matrix ( ECM) disorganization following the rotator cuff tendon injuries ( RCTI) delay the repair and healing process and the molecular mechanisms underlying RCTI pathology are largely unknown. Here , we examined the role of HMGB1 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in the inflammation<symptom> and ECM disorganization in RCTI. This hypothesis was tested in a tenotomy-RCTI rat model by transecting the RC tendon from the humerus. H&E and pentachrome staining revealed significant changes in the morphology , architecture and ECM organization in RC tendon tissues following RCTI when compared with contralateral control. Severity of the injury was high in the first two weeks with improvement in 3-4 weeks following RCTI , and this correlated with the healing response. The expression of proteins associated with increased HMGB-1 and upregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway , TLR4 , TLR2 , TREM-1 , RAGE , ASC , Caspase-1 , and IL-1Î² , in the first two weeks following RCTI followed by decline in 3-4 weeks. These results suggest the association of inflammatory responses and ECM disorganization with HMGB1 upregulation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the RC tendons and could provide novel target ( s) for development of better therapeutic strategies in the management of RCTI.
