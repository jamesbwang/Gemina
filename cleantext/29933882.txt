  The ability to deliver highly conformal radiation therapy using intensity-modulated radiation therapy and particle therapy provides for new opportunities to improve patient outcomes by reducing treatment-related morbidities following radiation therapy. By reducing the volume of normal tissue exposed to radiation therapy ( RT) , while also allowing for the opportunity to escalate the dose of RT delivered to the tumor , use of conformal RT delivery should also provide the possibility of expanding the therapeutic index of radiotherapy. However , the ability to safely and confidently deliver conformal RT is largely dependent on our ability to clearly define the clinical target volume for radiation therapy , which requires an in-depth knowledge of histopathologic extent of different tumor types , as well as patterns of recurrence data. In this article , we provide a comprehensive review of the histopathologic and radiographic data that provide the basis for evidence-based guidelines for clinical tumor volume delineation.
