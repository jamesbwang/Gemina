  The purpose of this study was to develop a facile and efficient method to enhance the stability and activity of lactoperoxidase ( LPO) by using its immobilization on graphene oxide nanosheets ( GO-NS). Following the LPO purification from bovine whey , it was immobilized onto functionalized GO-NS using glutaraldehyde as cross-linker. Kinetic properties and stability of free and immobilized LPO were investigated. LPO was purified 59.13 fold with a specific activity of 5.78 U/mg protein. The successful immobilization of LPO on functionalized GO-NS was confirmed by using dynamic light scattering ( DLS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR). The overall results showed that the stability of the immobilized LPO was considerably improved compared to free LPO. Apparent K Graphene oxide nanosheets are effective means for immobilization of LPO.
