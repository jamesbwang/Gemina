  There is a growing interest in controlling the synthesis of colloidal metal nanocrystals and thus tailoring their properties toward various applications. In this context , choosing an appropriate combination of reagents ( e.g. , salt precursor , reductant , capping agent , and stabilizer) plays a pivotal role in enabling the synthesis of metal nanocrystals with diversified sizes , shapes , and structures. Here we present a comprehensive review that highlights one of the key reagents for the synthesis of metal nanocrystals via chemical reduction: the reductants. We start with a brief introduction to the compounds commonly employed as reductants in the colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals by showing their oxidation half-reactions and the corresponding oxidation potentials. Then we offer specific examples pertaining to the controlled synthesis of metal nanocrystals , followed by some fundamental aspects covering the general mechanisms of metal ion reduction based on the Marcus Theory. Afterwards , we present a case-by-case discussion on a wide variety of reductants , including their major properties , reduction mechanisms , and additional effects on the final products. We illustrate these aspects by selecting key examples from the literature and paying close attention to the underlying mechanism in each case. At the end , we conclude by summarizing the highlights of the review and providing some perspectives on future directions.
