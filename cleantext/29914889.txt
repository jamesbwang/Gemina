  The importance of developing new animal models to assess the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid ( GC)- insensitive asthma has been stressed. Because of the asthma-prone background of A/J mice , we hypothesized that asthma changes in these animals would be or become resistant to GCs under repeated exposures to an allergen. A/J mice were challenged with OVA for 2 or 4 consecutive d , starting on day 19 postsensitization. Oral dexamethasone or inhaled budesonide were given 1 h before challenge , and analyses were done 24 h after the last challenge. Airway hyperreactivity , leukocyte infiltration , tissue remodeling , and cytokine levels as well as phosphorylated GC receptor ( p-GCR) , p-GATA-3 , p-p38 , MAPK phosphatase-1 ( MKP-1) , and GC-induced leucine zipper ( GILZ) levels were assessed. A/J mice subjected to two daily consecutive challenges reacted with airway hyperreactivity , subepithelial fibrosis<disease> , and marked accumulation of eosinophils in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peribronchial space , all of which were clearly sensitive to dexamethasone and budesonide. Conversely , under four provocations , most of these changes were steroid resistant. A significant reduction in p-GCR/GCR ratio following 4- but not 2-d treatment was observed , as compared with untreated positive control. Accordingly , steroid efficacy to transactivate MKP-1 and GILZ and to downregulate p-p38 , p-GATA-3 as well as proinflammatory cytokine levels was also seen after two but not four provocations. In conclusion , we report that repeated allergen exposure causes GC-insensitive asthma in A/J mice in a mechanism associated with decrease in GCR availability and subsequent loss of steroid capacity to modulate pivotal regulatory proteins , such as GATA-3 , p-p38 , MKP-1 , and GILZ.
