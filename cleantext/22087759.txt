  The main causes of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> differ between young adults and older adults. Data regarding potential targets for early intervention in young adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> are lacking. We retrospectively analysed data for 196 young adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> who were admitted to Tianjin Huanhu Hospital and died within 30 days of admission between June 2005 and June 2015. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival rate , and the log-rank test was used to determine survival rate significance. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses. Univariate analysis revealed a statistically significant association of age , disturbance of consciousness<symptom> , National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Glasgow Coma Scale scores , seizure<symptom> occurrence , infratentorial hemorrhage<symptom> , intraventricular extension , hernia , glucose level , white blood cell count , albumin level , creatinine level , uric acid level , and surgical treatment with early mortality ( P < 0.05). However , multivariate regression analysis revealed that only infratentorial hemorrhage<symptom> ( P = 0.003) and intraventricular extension ( P = 0.003) were significant risk factors for early mortality. Our results suggest that young adult patients who exhibit infratentorial hemorrhage<symptom> and intraventricular extension in the early stages of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> onset exhibit an increased risk of early mortality.
