  High fire hazard of epoxy resin ( EP) has been an unavoidable obstruction on its wide application. Here , a manganese phytate dotted polyaniline shell enwrapped carbon nanotube ( MPCNT) is facilely constructed and employed as flame retardant for EP. By adding 4.0 wt % MPCNT , the peak heat release rate , total heat release values , peak CO yields and total CO yields are decreased by 27.2 , 12.3 , 44.8 , and 23.3 % , respectively. The decreased absorbance intensity of toxic aromatic volatiles is also observed. Then , a tripartite cooperative flame retardant mechanism ( a continuous barrier network , catalytic charring function of phytate , and catalytic activity of MnP/C system) is proposed. Furthermore , the storage modulus of EP composites with 2.0 and 4.0 wt % MPCNT are increased by 23.0 and 25.8 % at 40 Â°C , respectively. Thus , the simultaneous reinforcements in fire safety and mechanical performance of EP are successfully achieved. This work may represent a significant step forward in the facile construction of functionalized carbon materials for achieving their whole potentials in polymer-matrix composite.
