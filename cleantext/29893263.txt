  Therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma should be tailored to the circumstances and preferences of the individual patient. Age should not be a barrier to effective treatment. Systematic geriatric screening and assessment contributes to the goal of personalised management , in addition to the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. A task force from the International Society of Geriatric Oncology ( SIOG) updated its 2009 consensus statement on the management of elderly patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma by reviewing data from studies involving recently approved targeted drugs and immunotherapies for this disease. Overall , it seems that age alone does not appreciably affect efficacy. Among the pivotal studies that were included , there is a striking scarcity of analyses that relate toxic effects to patient age. Even if the adverse effects of therapy are no more frequent or severe in elderly patients than in their younger counterparts , the practical , psychological , and functional impact of treatment may be greater , especially if toxic effects are chronic and cumulative.
