  Examine the characteristics and outcomes of pediatric trauma patients at risk for coagulopathy following implementation of viscoelastic monitoring. Injured children , aged < 18 years , from September 7 , 2014 , to December 21 , 2015 , at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy were identified from a single , level-1 American College of Surgeons verified pediatric trauma center. Patients were grouped by coagulation assessment: no assessment ( NA) , conventional coagulation testing alone ( CCT) , and conventional coagulation testing with rapid thromboelastography ( rTEG). Coagulation assessment was provider preference with all monitoring options continuously available. Groups were compared and outcomes were evaluated including blood product utilization , Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) utilization , duration of mechanical ventilation , and mortality. A total of 155 patients were identified ( NA = 78 , CCT = 54 , and rTEG = 23). There was no difference in age , gender , race , or mechanism. In practice , rTEG patients were more severely injured , more anemic , and received more blood products and crystalloid ( Viscoelastic monitoring was infrequently performed , but utilized in more severely injured patients. Well-designed prospective studies in patients at high risk of coagulopathy are needed to evaluate goal-directed hemostatic resuscitation strategies in children.
