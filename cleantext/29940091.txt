  The care of lung transplant recipients with prolonged index hospitalizations can be ethically complex , with conflicts arising over whether the expected outcomes justify ongoing intensive interventions. There are limited data to guide these conversations. The objective of this study was to evaluate survival to discharge for lung transplant recipients based on length of stay ( LOS). This was a retrospective cohort study of adult lung transplant recipients in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. For each day of the index hospitalization the mortality rate among patients who survived to that length of stay or longer was calculated. Post-discharge survival was compared in those with and without a prolonged hospitalization ( defined as the 97th percentile ( > 90 days)). Among the 19 250 included recipients , the index hospitalization mortality was 5.4 %. Posttransplant stroke and need for dialysis were the strongest predictors of index hospitalization mortality. No individual or combination of available risk factors , however , was associated with inpatient mortality consistently above 50 %. Recipients with > 90 day index hospitalization had a 28.8 % subsequent inpatient mortality. Their 1 , 3 and 5 year survival following discharge was 53 % , 26 % , and 16 %. These data provide additional context to goals of care conversations for transplant recipients with prolonged index hospitalizations.
