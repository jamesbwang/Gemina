  Research over the past several decades has provided insight into the mode of action of adjuvants. However , the main focus of attention has been the efficacy in the induction of protective immunogenicity , while less effort has been devoted to the study of toxicity mechanisms. Evidences suggest that several mechanisms that are responsible for the immunostimulating effects are , at the same time , responsible of the adverse effects. In this context , it is often very difficult to establish the boundaries between immunostimulation and immunotoxicity to reach the ideal balance<symptom> of efficacy/safety. During decades , hundreds of adjuvants and adjuvant formulations have been proposed as immunostimulants for vaccines but very few have been used in human vaccines due to toxicity concerns. In this review , relevant aspects about immunotoxicology of adjuvants , based on clinical and experimental studies are discussed. Some effects are only observed under hyperstimulating regimens using non-approved adjuvants for human use , but these are nonetheless useful to understanding basic principles of adjuvant toxicity. The acute local and systemic reactions , during the first hours and those that can be observed after the third day of vaccination in the inoculation site and systemically are discussed.
