  The synthesis and biophysical studies of fluorinated phospholipids have attracted a lot of interest over the past 40 years. Mono- and polyfluorinated phospholipids , containing 1-4 fluorine atoms , are designed mostly with the goal of developing new model membranes<symptom>. The fluorine atoms are herein used as probes , mainly in 19F-NMR spectroscopy , to study biomolecule complexes. In this case , the spectroscopic features of the fluorine atom and the preservation of the parent lipid properties are of primary importance. On the other hand , highly fluorinated phospholipids , which contain a perfluorinated segment in alkyl chains , are mainly developed as drug-delivery devices and oxygen carriers. Here , the particular chemical characteristics of fluorine are used to form more stable and less toxic lipid vesicles/emulsions. This review will focus on describing the synthetic pathways for mono- , poly- and highly fluorinated phosphatidylcholines. We will also discuss , though not thoroughly , their properties and potential applications.
