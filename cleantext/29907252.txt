  Opisthorchiasis is a neglected tropical disease of major proportion , caused by the carcinogenic , Asian liver fluke , Opisthorchis viverrini. This hepatobiliary disease is known to be associated with malignant cancer ( cholangiocarcinoma , CCA) and affects millions of people in Southeast Asia. No vaccine is available , and only one drug ( praziquantel) is routinely employed against the parasite. Despite technological advances , little is known about the molecular biology of the fluke itself and the disease complex<disease> that it causes in humans. The advent of high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing and bioinformatic technologies is enabling researchers to gain global insights into the molecular pathways and processes in parasites. The principal aims of this chapter are to ( 1) review molecular research of O. viverrini and opisthorchiasis; ( 2) provide an account of recent advances in the sequencing and characterization of the genome and transcriptomes of O. viverrini; ( 3) describe the complex life of this worm in the biliary system of the definitive ( human) host and how the fluke interacts with this host and causes disease at the molecular level; ( 4) discuss the implications of systems biological research and ( 5) consider how progress in genomics and informatics might enable explorations of O. viverrini and related worms and the discovery of new interventions against opisthorchiasis and CCA.
