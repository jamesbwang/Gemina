  OxyR and SoxR are two transcriptional regulators in response to oxidative stress in most bacteria , and SoxR has been reported to be activated by the endogenous redox-cycling compound phenazines in phenazine-producing organisms. However , which transcriptional regulator is activated in pathogens treated with the antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid ( PCA) has not been determined. In this study , we found that PCA treatment activated OxyR rather than SoxR in the phytopathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae<pathogen> pv. oryzae<pathogen> ( Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae<pathogen> pv. oryzicola ( Xoc). We also found Xoo was much sensitive to PCA and H2O2 and had a defective antioxidant system , i.e. , less of total antioxidant capacity and total catalase activity than Xoc , although Xoo and Xoc are very closely related. Based on KEGG sequences , OxyR differs in 10 amino acids in Xoo vs. Xoc. By exchanging OxyR between Xoo and Xoc , we elucidated that OxyR contributed to the differences in antioxidant capacity , total catalase activity , and sensitivity to PCA and H2O2. We also found that OxyR affected Xoo and Xoc growth in a nutrient-poor medium , virulence on host plants ( rice) , and the hypersensitive response ( HR) on non-host plants ( Nicotiana benthamiana). Thus , OxyR is a critical regulator that relates to the differences in anti-oxidative stress between Xoo and Xoc and contributes to the differences in survival of them against oxidative stress.
