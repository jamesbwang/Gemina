  The cytolytic peptide melittin ( MLT) is an important candidate of anticancer drug owing to its hemolytic properties. Nevertheless , its clinical applications are severely restricted as a result of its nonspecific toxicities like hemolysis<symptom>. In this work , we reported MLT-loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 ( MLT@ZIF-8) nanoparticles ( NPs). The formed MLT@ZIF-8 NPs not only possess excellent stability but also efficiently inhibit the hemolysis<symptom> bioactivity of MLT. Confocal scanning imaging and cytotoxicity experiments revealed that as-synthesized MLT@ZIF-8 NPs exhibit enhanced cellular uptake and cytotoxicity toward cancer cells compared to MLT. The mechanism is well investigated by a series of transcriptome analysis , which indicates that MLT@ZIF-8 NPs can regulate the expression of 3383 genes , and the PI3K/Akt-regulated p53 pathway is involved in MLT@ZIF-8 NPs induced A549 cells apoptosis. Finally , MLT@ZIF-8 NPs exhibit enhanced antitumor activity than free MLT in vivo , while no obvious systemic toxicity has been found. This work emphasizes the great potential of utilizing MOF as a simple and efficient nanoplatform for deliverying cytolytic peptides in cancer treatment , and also the investigation on the antitumor mechanism could provide theoretical support for clinical usage of MLT.
