  The mammalian heart is by now an established endocrine organ whose myocytes in a regulated manner release atrial<symptom> and ventricular natriuretic peptides ( ANP and BNP). But like other hormone-producing cells in classic endocrine organs , the cardiac myocytes also express genes of additional peptide hormones. One such hormone gene is that of the well-known pleiotropic gut-brain peptide system , cholecystokinin ( CCK) , which is expressed at mRNA and protein levels in both atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes. The posttranslational processing of proCCK in the myocytes , however , deviates substantially from that of other CCK-producing cells. Hence , the predominant cardiac proCCK product is devoid of the N-terminal 1-24 fragment , and besides O-sulfated at three C-terminal tyrosyl residues ( Y
