  Primary liver cancer ( PLC) is one of the most common malignant tumours and has the third highest mortality rate worldwide. An active liver-targeting drug delivery system via the asialoglycoprotein receptors expressed in the hepatic parenchyma cells of mammals has become a research focus for the treatment of PLC.. N-acetylaminogalactosyl-poly ( lactide-co-glycolide)- succinyl-D-Î±-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate ( GalNAc-PLGA-sTPGS) was synthesized to achieve active liver-targeting properties. Emodin ( EMO)- loaded GalNAc-PLGA-sTPGS nanoparticles ( EGPTN) were prepared with EMO which was selected for its potential antitumour efficacy. The in vitro cellular uptake , mechanism , cytotoxicity , and apoptosis of HepG2 cells were analyzed. The in vivo therapeutic effects of EGPTN were assessed in a PLC mouse model. The results showed that GalNAc-PLGA-sTPGS was successfully synthesized. The cellular uptake assay demonstrated that coumarin 6-loaded GalNAc-PLGA-sTPGS nanoparticles had superior active liver-targeting properties. The results of the cytotoxity and apoptosis studies indicated that EGPTN achieved the highest levels of cytotoxicity and cell apoptotic rate among the nanoparticles examined. Furthermore , EGPTN showed better in vivo therapeutic effects and anticancer efficacy in the PLC mice than did the other groups. Therefore , EGPTN enhanced the anticancer effect of EMO both in vitro and in vivo , making it a potential option for the treatment of PLC..
