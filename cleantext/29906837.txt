  We determine the exact short-time distribution- lnP _ ( f) ( H , t) = S _ ( f) ( H)/ sqrt ( t) of the one-point height H = h ( x = 0 , t) of an evolving 1 +1 Kardar-Parisi-Zhang ( KPZ) interface for flat initial condition. This is achieved by combining ( i) the optimal fluctuation method , ( ii) a time-reversal symmetry of the KPZ equation in 1 +1 dimension , and ( iii) the recently determined exact short-time height distribution- lnP _ ( st) ( H , t) = S _ ( st) ( H)/ sqrt ( t) for stationary initial condition. In studying the large-deviation function S _ ( st) ( H) of the latter , one encounters two branches: an analytic and a nonanalytic. The analytic branch is nonphysical beyond a critical value of H where a second-order dynamical phase transition occurs. Here we show that , remarkably , it is the analytic branch of S _ ( st) ( H) which determines the large-deviation function S _ ( f) ( H) of the flat interface via a simple mapping S _ ( f) ( H) = 2 ^ ( -3/ 2) S _ ( st) ( 2H).
