  The differential expression of microRNAs ( miRNAs) in plasma of pancreatic cancer ( PC) patients may act as a diagnostic biomarker. A four-stage study was performed to identify plasma miRNAs with potential in detecting PC. Exiqon panels ( 20 PC vs. 10 normal controls ( NCs)) were applied in the screening phase to obtain miRNA profiling. The identified miRNAs were further assessed in the training ( 40 PC vs. 40 NCs) and testing stages ( 112 PC vs. 116 NCs) with qRT-PCR assays. A six-miRNA signature including up-regulated miR-122-5p , miR-125b-5p , miR-192-5p , miR-193b-3p , miR-221-3p and miR-27b-3p was identified. The signature could accurately discriminate PC patients from NCs with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.848 , 0.833 and 0.937 for the training , testing and the external validation stage ( 41 PC vs. 50 NCs) , respectively. The multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that down-regulated plasma miR-125b-5p could predict worse OS independent from late tumor stage and high CA19-9. All the six miRNAs except miR-122-5p showed high expression levels in PC tissues than those in matched normal tissues. MiR-122-5p and miR-193b-3p were up-regulated , while miR-221-3p was down-regulated in plasma exosomes from PC patients. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that the miRNAs might involve in several molecular pathways closely related with PC such as p53 signaling pathway , pancreatic cancer , TGF-beta signaling pathway and so on. In conclusion , we identified a six-miRNA signature in plasma which could act as a non-invasive biomarker in diagnosis and prognosis of PC. Plasma miR-125b-5p might act as an independent biomarker in predicting OS of PC patients.
