  Nivolumab is an effective and tolerable treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma , showing longer median overall survival than everolimus and achieving a good percentage of objective response , stable disease , and prolonged responses. However , very few cases have been reported in the literature of a complete response to nivolumab in the metastatic pretreated setting. Here , we report a case of complete response to nivolumab in II line following sunitinib in a metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma with favorable risk according to the IMDC criteria. This is also an interesting case on the use of immunotherapy following a long period of antiangiogenetic therapy , underlining the importance of the sequence of treatment to achieve the best possible outcome in terms of prolonged overall survival , progression-free survival , and objective response.
