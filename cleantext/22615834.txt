  The tazarotene-induced gene 1 ( TIG1) protein is a retinoid-inducible growth regulator and is considered a tumor suppressor. Here , we show that DnaJ heat shock<symptom> protein family member C8 ( DNAJC8) is a TIG1 target that regulates glycolysis. Ectopic DNAJC8 expression induced the translocation of pyruvate kinase M2 ( PKM2) into the nucleus , subsequently inducing glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT1) expression to promote glucose uptake. Silencing either DNAJC8 or PKM2 alleviated the upregulation of GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake induced by ectopic DNAJC8 expression. TIG1 interacted with DNAJC8 in the cytosol , and this interaction completely blocked DNAJC8-mediated PKM2 translocation and inhibited glucose uptake. Furthermore , increased glycose uptake was observed in cells in which TIG1 was silenced. In conclusion , TIG1 acts as a pivotal repressor of DNAJC8 to enhance glucose uptake by partially regulating PKM2 translocation.
