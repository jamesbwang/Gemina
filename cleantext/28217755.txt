  This study aimed to identify clinicopathological factors associated with the outcome of elderly patients with gastric cancer ( GC) , and to construct a nomogram for individual risk prediction. Tumor characteristics of 143 patients aged â‰¥ 80 years underwent surgery for GC were collected and analyzed by uni- and multivariate analyses. A prognostic nomogram was constructed using the factors which resulted to be significantly associated with overall survival. Discrimination of nomogram was tested by Kaplan-Meier ( KM) curves and boxplots. With a median follow up of 18.37 months , overall 1-year survival rate was 51 % and it was 60 and 40 % for older and younger than 83 years , respectively ( P = 0.003). Univariate analysis indicated that age ( P = 0.008) , pre-operatory performance status ( P < 0.001) , depth of invasion ( P = 0.007) , lymph nodes involvement ( P < 0.001) , and residual tumor ( P < 0.001) were significant prognostic factors. Based on these variables , a nomogram to predict 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months survival probability after GC surgery was developed. KM and boxplots according to the range of nomogram total points highlighted the appropriateness of distinguish the patients ' survival in all the subgroups. Moreover , this nomogram exhibited superior prognostic discrimination between intermediate stages ( II-III) than AJCC-TNM classification. This study showed that after good surgical selection , the prognosis of elderly GC patients may be influenced by several clinicopathological factors. Therefore , a predictive nomogram to distinguish more accurately fit patients may allow physicians to individualize treatments and to detect those patients who may benefit from an intensive multidisciplinary approach.
