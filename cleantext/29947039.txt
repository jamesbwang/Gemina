  Conventional 2D ultrasonography is the gold standard for diagnosing congenital heart disease ( CHD). Characterization of complex CHD may be limited by 2D imaging methods that lack crucial spatial information as these images are generated as individual `` slices '' without orientation and with a limited field of view lacking depth , and therefore not ideal for 3D modeling and printing. While approximately 90 % of 3D printed models of the cardiovascular system are derived from CT or MRI
