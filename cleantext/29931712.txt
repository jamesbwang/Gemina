  The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the frequency of pharyngeal<symptom> collapse in a large group of brachycephalic dogs undergoing videofluoroscopic assessment of swallowing or airway diameter. We hypothesized that brachycephalic dogs would have pharyngeal collapse more frequently than dolichocephalic or mesocephalic dogs with or without airway collapse. The medical records database was searched for brachycephalic dogs undergoing videofluoroscopy of swallowing or airway diameter between January 1 , 2006 and December 31 , 2015. A cohort of dolichocephalic/mesocephalic dogs with videofluoroscopically confirmed airway collapse was age and time matched for comparison. A control group of dolichocephalic/mesocephalic dogs that did not have documented airway collapse was also evaluated. All fluoroscopic studies were assessed by a board certified veterinary radiologist for the presence and degree of pharyngeal<symptom> collapse. Results demonstrate that pharyngeal<symptom> collapse was significantly more common in brachycephalic dogs ( 58/82; 72 %) than in nonbrachycephalic dogs with ( 7/25; 28 %) and without ( 2/30; 7 %) airway collapse. Pharyngeal collapse is more prevalent in brachycephalic dogs undergoing videofluoroscopy than in dolichocephalic/mesocephalic dogs with or without airway collapse.
