  Dementia with Lewy bodies ( DLB) is a heterogeneous disease in which clinical presentation , symptoms , and evolution widely varies between patients. To investigate the existence of clinical subtypes in DLB based on the initial clinical presentation. 81 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable DLB were consecutively included. All patients underwent a neurological evaluation including a structured questionnaire about neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep , an assessment of motor impairment ( Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale subscale III) , and a formal neuropsychological evaluation. Onset of core symptoms ( hallucinations , parkinsonism , and fluctuations) and dementia were systematically reviewed from medical records. We applied a K-means clustering method based on the initial clinical presentation. Cluster analysis yielded three different groups. Patients in cluster I ( cognitive-predominant , n = 46) presented more frequently with cognitive symptoms ( 95.7 % , n = 44 , p < 0.001) , and showed a longer duration from onset to DLB diagnosis ( p < 0.001) than the other clusters. Patients in cluster II ( neuropsychiatric-predominant , n = 22) were older at disease onset ( 78.1 ± 5 versus 73.6 ± 6.1 and 73.6 ± 4.2 in clusters I and III , respectively , both p < 0.01) , presented more frequently with psychotic symptoms ( 77.3 % , n = 17) , and had a shorter duration until the onset of hallucinations ( p < 0.001). Patients in cluster III ( parkinsonism-predominant , n = 13) showed a shorter time from onset to presence of parkinsonism ( p < 0.001) and dementia ( 0.008). Three clinical subtypes of DLB can be defined when considering the differential initial presentations. The proposed subtypes have distinct clinical profiles and progression patterns.
