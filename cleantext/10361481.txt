  Congenital hypothyroidism remains one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation among children. Screening for congenital hypothyroidism remains one of the most cost-effective tools to prevent mental retardation in the population. Umbilical cord blood thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH) levels remain an attractive and a practical step for screening for congenital hypothyroidism. The aims of this study were as follows: ( 1) to find normative values of cord blood TSH for the study group and ( 2) to use cord blood TSH levels as a marker for screening of congenital hypothyroidism. Cord blood of 1824 neonates who were of term gestation , weighed > 2.5 kg at birth , whose mothers were off thyroid medication were a part of the study group. Umbilical cord blood was collected at the time of delivery and TSH was estimated. All babies who had a cord blood TSH value of > 20 mIU/L were called bay on day 7 of life for a full thyroid profile. Cord blood samples of 1824 neonates were tested for TSH. Male-female ratio was 979:845 = 1.15:1. The birth weights ranged between 2.5 and 4.5 kg with an average birth weight of 2.811 kg. Mean ( standard deviation) TSH value was 7.725 ( 8.99). TSH values ranged between 1.2 and 100 mIU/ml. TSH values corresponding to the 3
