  Activation of the hamstrings has been discussed as a measure for reducing strain on the ACL during jump landings in alpine skiing. The current study tested the hypothesis that hamstring and quadriceps activation can be voluntarily increased by the athlete. Specifically , two different instructions- to increase hamstring activation or to increase upper-leg co-contraction- were compared to normal landings. Eight members of the German national and junior national squad in freestyle skiing ( age 19.6 ± 3.8 years; weight 66.1 ± 13.2 kg; height 172.2 ± 7.7 cm) performed 12 jump landings on a prepared run , 4 with no specific instruction , 4 with the instruction to generally activate the thigh muscles , and 4 with the instruction to specifically activate the hamstrings. Electromyographic ( EMG) signals were recorded on the biceps femoris ( BF) , semitendinosus ( ST) , vastus lateralis ( VL) , rectus<pathogen> femoris ( RF) and vastus medialis ( VM). EMG activation levels were integrated over three landing phases and analysed with a repeated measures ANOVA. The instruction produced a significant main effect in ST ( p = .026) , VM ( p = .032) and RF ( p = .001). Contrary to previous research , the current study suggests that hamstring muscle activation levels can be voluntarily increased during jump landing , particularly in co-activation with its antagonists.
