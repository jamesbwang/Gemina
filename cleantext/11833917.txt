  Carbon emissions from human and animals has been neglected by previous studies in estimating the carbon cycle of ecosystem. This study first estimates the spatial-temporal patterns of carbon emissions density from human and livestock respiration<symptom> among countries around the world from 1960-2014. Then we simulate the soil heterotrophic respiration<symptom> ( R
