  To evaluate the clinical outcome of 25-gauge lens-sparing vitrectomy with dissection of retrolental adhesions on the peripheral retina for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy in infants. Fifty-one eyes of 39 infants with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy associated with retrolental adhesions on the peripheral retina , retinal fold with macular detachment , and partial lens opacity<symptom>. A 25-gauge lens-sparing vitrectomy was performed , and retrolental adhesions between the peripheral retina and the posterior lens capsule were surgically dissected. Lens opacification , as assessed or graded by Lens Opacities Classification System III , and the retinal reattachment rate were observed and recorded monthly for up to 7 months postoperatively. After 7 months , the detached retina along the retinal fold was reattached in 42/51 ( 82.4 %) eyes; the macula was reattached completely in 26/51 ( 51.0 %) eyes and partially in 15/51 ( 29.4 %) eyes. There was no statistically significant change in the lens opacity<symptom> of the posterior capsule or cortex before or after surgery ( P > 0.05 , paired t test) or in postoperative progression of lens opacity<symptom> ( P > 0.05 , modified McNemar 's test) according to Lens Opacities Classification System III scores. A 25-gauge lens-sparing vitrectomy with dissection of peripheral retinal retrolental adhesions is helpful for preservation of the lens and reattachment of the macula in infants with FEVR.
