  Molecular-level properties of ionic liquids ( ILs) draw an increasing interest. Several informative experimental approaches for investigation of nano/miscrostructuring phenomena and local viscosity/rigidity of ILs use probe molecules sensitive to microenvironment along with suitable detection techniques. In this work , we for the first time investigate capabilities of photoexcited triplet fullerenes to probe local properties of ILs , with time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance ( TR EPR) being a sensitive detection tool. We have selected C
