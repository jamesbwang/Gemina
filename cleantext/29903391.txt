  Nearly 1 in 5 patients hospitalized for ovarian cancer surgery are readmitted for complications that may have been prevented with monitoring. We conducted a randomized controlled feasibility trial to evaluate a postoperative web-based app intervention to provide real-time symptom monitoring among patients diagnosed or with suspected gynecological cancer who had open bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy surgery. Participants were randomized into two groups: ( 1) App + Reminder: had access to the app , and use was encouraged with daily and/or weekly reminders; ( 2) app: had access to the app but received no reminders. The app displayed discharge instructions and queried symptoms. Patients ' self-reported health information was integrated into their electronic health records. Outcomes above a predetermined threshold triggered alerts that indicated a patient may need medical intervention. Participants completed a questionnaire at baseline and 30-day follow-up. They were also invited to provide qualitative , post-intervention feedback. We screened 35 patients , with high rates of recruitment ( 74 % , N = 26) and completion ( 93 % , N = 24). Participants in the App + Reminder group had more frequent app use relative to the app group ( p = 0.05). Using differences-in-differences ( DID) analysis for quality of life , the App + Reminder group had relative increase in the mental health score ( DID = 7.51 , p = 0.15) but decrease in the physical health score ( DID = -7.49 , p = 0.13). Participant feedback suggested the relative decrease in physical quality of life was attributable to the app activating patients ' focus on physical symptoms , not the intervention. The pilot established feasibility , acceptability , and some potential benefits of a new web-based app intervention for gynecological oncology postoperative care.
