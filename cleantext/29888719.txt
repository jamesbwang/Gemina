 : Complex soft tissue defects around the knee are not common. They pose significant reconstructive challenges; hence , several methods have been tried. In this study , the use of proximally based sural island<disease> fasciocutaneous flap is evaluated.: The aim of this study is to report our experience with the use of proximally based sural island<disease> fasciocutaneous flap in the reconstruction of complex soft tissue defects around the knee. This was a prospective study. All patients that presented to the unit with complex soft tissue defects around the knee between December 2012 and November 2014 were included in this study. Data on age , sex , etiology , anatomical location of the defect , and flap size were noted and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Follow-up was for a minimum of 6 months.: There were 15 cases: 11 males and 4 females. Their ages ranged from 6 years to 47 years with an average age of 29 years. Ten of the defects resulted from road traffic accidents , while five were missile injuries. The anterior and lateral surfaces of the knee were more often involved , while the posterior surface was least involved. The flap sizes ranged from 8 cm × 6 cm to 16 cm × 12 cm , and the pedicle length ranged from 6 cm to 12 cm. All 15 flaps had full survival. A total of 13 patients had their donor sites skin grafted primarily with 96 % -100 % graft take. The other two patients had their donor sites closed directly. The proximally based sural island<disease> fasciocutaneous flap is a simple and reliable method of reconstruction for soft tissue defects around the knee.
