  Borderline personality disorder ( PD) has historically been cast as an unabating condition. Longitudinal data , however , support a more variable time course marked by remission and relapse. In the present study , we tested the possibility that borderline PD has both stable ( i.e. , consistently present across time and situation , as modern diagnostic systems stipulate) and dynamic ( i.e. , episodic and situational) elements. Participants were 668 patients from the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study who were administered semistructured diagnostic interviews 5 times over a decade. Trait-state-occasion modeling dissected borderline pathology into time-invariant ( i.e. , trait) and time-varying ( i.e. , state) components. Contradicting traditional views of PD intransigence , less than half of borderline PD variability ( approximately 45 %) was time-invariant ( i.e. , perfectly stable) over the study timeframe. Furthermore , we found that the time-invariant component of borderline pathology , which we termed borderline proneness , was very closely related ( r = .81) to a previously validated Five Factor Model trait composite of borderline features. Moreover , the trait versus state components showed a clear pattern of discriminant validity in relation to several putative causal agents for borderline PD ( i.e. , environmental pathogens , temperament dimensions). We conclude that borderline pathology contains a stable core and sizable situational components , and that both elements relate systematically to normative personality dimensions and known risk factors. These findings have key implications for etiological research , prognosis , and treatment for borderline PD. ( PsycINFO Database Record
