  Neurocysticercosis ( NCC) , a common cause of seizures<symptom> in children from low and middle income countries ( LMICs) , if not diagnosed and treated early enough may lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. There is a lack of data on the prevalence of NCC and its clinical characteristics among those with seizure<symptom> in South-Western Nepal. To study the prevalence and clinical characteristics of NCC in children with seizures<symptom>. All children admitted to Universal College of Medical Sciences , a tertiary hospital in South-Western Nepal with seizures<symptom> during 2014-16 , were tested for NCC. NCC was diagnosed by neuroimaging ( computerized tomography ( CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)). We used logistic regression to test the association between NCC with participants ' characteristics and clinical symptoms. Among 4962 in-patient children , 168 ( 104 boys and 64 girls) had seizures<symptom> ( 138 with generalized tonic clonic seizures<symptom> ( GTCS) and 30 with focal seizures<symptom>). 43 % of children with seizures<symptom> had CT scan confirmed NCC. The prevalence of NCC in the oldest children ( 13-16 years) was significantly greater ( 57.1 % versus 15.6 %) compared to the youngest ( 0-4 years) one ( This study shows that NCC contributes significantly to higher prevalence of seizures<symptom> in children in South-Western region of Nepal.
