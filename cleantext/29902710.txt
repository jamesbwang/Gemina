  Acute liver injury ( ALI) is a dramatic liver disease characterized by large areas of inflammation<symptom> in the liver. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ginsenoside Rg1 ( Rg1) , a biologically active component in Panax ginseng , on lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine ( LPS/D-GalN)- induced ALI in mice , and meanwhile explore the molecular mechanism in vivo and in vitro. Mice were pretreated with Rg1 for three days prior to LPS ( 40 μg/kg)/ D-GalN ( 700 mg/kg) administration. The results showed that Rg1 improved the survival rate and reduced the liver to body<symptom> weight ratios in mice. Rg1 also reduced the production of oxidative markers such as MDA and MPO induced by LPS/D-GalN. In addition , Rg1 significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α , IL-6 , IL-1β , Mip-2 , Mcp-1 , iNOS , and increased the activity of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Moreover , Rg1 inhibited the protein expression of TLR4 and its downstream genes including NF-κB and MAPKs , which are involved in inflammatory response. Rg1 dramatically reduced oxidative stress by regulating the expression of efflux transporters Mrp2 and various enzymes including GCLC , GCLM , HO-1 and NQO1. However , the changes in these genes and protein induced by Rg1 were abrogated by TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 in vitro. In conclusion , Rg1 had hepatoprotective effect on LPS/D-GalN-induced ALI in mice. The protection may be associated with the inhibition of TLR4. These findings suggest that Rg1 may be a promising agent for prevention against ALI.
