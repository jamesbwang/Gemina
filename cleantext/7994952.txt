  Failures unique to posterior cruciate-substituting total knee prostheses rarely include polyethylene post fractures but have been described. We report a case involving a fracture of the distal insert cone of a rotating-platform ( RP) polyethylene liner in a primary total knee arthroplasty. This case highlights a 67-year-old male presenting with new-onset knee pain and recurrent effusions<symptom> with osteolysis 11 years following placement of a posterior-stabilized , RP total knee arthroplasty. At the time of revision surgery , the polyethylene insert cone was found to be fractured just below the junction between cone and the body of the insert. Liner exchange , synovectomy , and osteolytic-defect curettage and cement packing were performed. One year following revision surgery , the patient is without pain and has returned to function without limitations. Clinicians must be aware of this possible failure with RP prostheses in the setting of pain with a stable knee , recurrent aseptic effusions<symptom> , and osteolysis.
