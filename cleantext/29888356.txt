  This article is an overview of the present and ongoing developments in the field of nanomaterial-based sensors for enabling fast , relatively inexpensive and minimally ( or non-) invasive diagnostics of health conditions with follow-up by detecting volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) excreted from one or combination of human body fluids and tissues ( e.g. , blood , urine , breath , skin). Part of the review provides a didactic examination of the concepts and approaches related to emerging sensing materials and transduction techniques linked with the VOC-based non-invasive medical evaluations. We also present and discuss diverse characteristics of these innovative sensors , such as their mode of operation , sensitivity , selectivity and response time , as well as the major approaches proposed for enhancing their ability as hybrid sensors to afford multidimensional sensing and information-based sensing. The other parts of the review give an updated compilation of the past and currently available VOC-based sensors for disease diagnostics. This compilation summarizes all VOCs identified in relation to sickness and sampling origin that links these data with advanced nanomaterial-based sensing technologies. Both strength and pitfalls are discussed and criticized , particularly from the perspective of the information and communication era. Further ideas regarding improvement of sensors , sensor arrays , sensing devices and the proposed workflow are also included.
