  Post-translational phosphorylation is essential to human cellular processes , but the transient , heterogeneous nature of this modification complicates its study in native systems. We developed an approach to interrogate phosphorylation and its role in protein-protein interactions on a proteome-wide scale. We genetically encoded phosphoserine in recoded E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and generated a peptide-based heterologous representation of the human serine phosphoproteome. We designed a single-plasmid library encoding > 100,000 human phosphopeptides and confirmed the site-specific incorporation of phosphoserine in > 36,000 of these peptides. We then integrated our phosphopeptide library into an approach known as Hi-P to enable proteome-level screens for serine-phosphorylation-dependent human protein interactions. Using Hi-P , we found hundreds of known and potentially new phosphoserine-dependent interactors with 14-3-3 proteins and WW domains. These phosphosites retained important binding characteristics of the native human phosphoproteome , as determined by motif analysis and pull-downs using full-length phosphoproteins. This technology can be used to interrogate user-defined phosphoproteomes in any organism , tissue , or disease of interest.
