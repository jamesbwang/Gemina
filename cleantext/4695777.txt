  Patients with vestibular migraine are susceptible to motion sickness. This study aimed to determine whether the severity of posture<symptom> instability is related to the susceptibility to motion sickness. We used a visual motion paradigm with two conditions of the stimulated retinal field and the head posture<symptom> to quantify postural stability while maintaining a static stance in 18 patients with vestibular migraine and in 13 age-matched healthy subjects. Three parameters of postural stability showed differences between VM patients and controls: RMS velocity ( 0.34 ± 0.02 cm/s vs. 0.28 ± 0.02 cm/s) , RMS acceleration ( 8.94 ± 0.74 cm/s
