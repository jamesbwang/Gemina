  The growing frequency of bluetongue virus ( BTV) incursions in Europe in recent years led to the largest BTV outbreak ever recorded in 2006/09 , with a dramatic impact on the cattle and sheep industries. The complex epidemiology of this vector-borne disease of ruminants and its recent emergence need to be better understood to identify and implement efficient control strategies. Mathematical models provide useful tools for that purpose; many of them have been developed in the light of the 2006/09 outbreak. We aimed to provide a systematic review of compartmental mathematical models dedicated to BTV occurrence or transmission in European countries , to assess robustness of findings to different modelling approaches and assumptions. We identified relevant papers from PubMed and Scopus databases , 21 of which were included in the review following the selection process laid out in the PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. We systematically extracted data from these papers to address the diversity and evolution of modelling approaches , and to identify important characteristics for future model development. Then , we summarized the main insights provided into bluetongue epidemiology , and discussed the relevance of these models as tools for risk mapping and for the design of surveillance and control systems. On the whole , the mechanistic models reviewed provided flexible frameworks , yielding mostly epidemiological insights specific to geographical areas and study periods. Despite the limitations of these models that sometimes relied on strong assumptions , we advocate their use to facilitate and inform evidence-based decision-making in animal health.
