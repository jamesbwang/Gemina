  The aim of the present paper is to provide a quantitative prediction of the stretch-induced crystallization in natural rubber , the exclusive reason for its history-dependent thermomechanical features. A constitutive model based on a micromechanism inspired molecular chain approach is formulated within the context of the thermodynamic framework. The molecular configuration of the partially crystallized single chain is analyzed and calculated by means of some statistical mechanical methods. The random thermal oscillation of the crystal orientation , considered as a continuous random variable , is treated by means of a representative angle. The physical expression of the chain free energy is derived according to a two-step strategy by separating crystallization and stretching. This strategy ensures that the stretch-induced part of the thermodynamic crystallization force is null at the initial instant and allows , without any additional constraint , the formulation of a simple linear relationship for the crystallinity evolution law. The model contains very few physically interpretable material constants to simulate the complex mechanism: two chain-scale constants , one crystallinity kinetics constant , three thermodynamic constants related to the newly formed crystallites , and a function controlling the crystal orientation with respect to the chain. The model is used to discuss some important aspects of the micromechanism and the macroresponse under the equilibrium state and the nonequilibrium state involved during stretching and recovery , and continuous relaxation.
