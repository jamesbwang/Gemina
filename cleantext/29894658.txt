  To act upon the world , creatures must change continuous variables such as muscle length or chemical concentration. In contrast , decision making is an inherently discrete process , involving the selection among alternative courses of action. In this article , we consider the interface between the discrete and continuous processes that translate our decisions into movement in a Newtonian world-and how movement informs our decisions. We do so by appealing to active inference , with a special focus on the oculomotor system. Within this exemplar system , we argue that the superior colliculus is well placed to act as a discrete-continuous interface. Interestingly , when the neuronal computations within the superior colliculus are formulated in terms of active inference , we find that many aspects of its neuroanatomy emerge from the computations it must perform in this role.
