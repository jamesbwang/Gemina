  Although defects in the RB1 tumour suppressor are one of the more common driver alterations found in triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) , therapeutic approaches that exploit this have not been identified. By integrating molecular profiling data with data from multiple genetic perturbation screens , we identified candidate synthetic lethal ( SL) interactions associated with RB1 defects in TNBC. We refined this analysis by identifying the highly penetrant effects , reasoning that these would be more robust in the face of molecular heterogeneity and would represent more promising therapeutic targets. A significant proportion of the highly penetrant RB1 SL effects involved proteins closely associated with RB1 function , suggesting that this might be a defining characteristic. These included nuclear pore complex components associated with the MAD2 spindle checkpoint protein , the kinase and bromodomain containing transcription factor TAF1 , and multiple components of the SCF
