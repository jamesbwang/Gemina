  Sliding-window conjugate-gradient highly constrained back-projection reconstruction ( SW-CG-HYPR) allows whole left ventricular coverage , improved temporal and spatial resolution , and signal-to-noise ratio compared to the conventional 3-slice saturation recovery turbo-fast low-angle shot ( SR-Turbo-FLASH) sequence. We prospectively compared the diagnostic value of whole leftventricular coverage myocardial perfusion magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and conventional 3-slice technique in patients with suspected coronary artery disease ( CAD). Thirty consecutive patients with suspected CAD who were scheduled for coronary angiography underwent myocardial perfusion MRI with both SW-CG-HYPR and SR-Turbo-FLASH in random order at 3.0 T. Perfusion defects were interpreted visually by two blinded observers and were correlated to x-ray angiographic stenoses ≥ 50 %. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic performance of the two imaging techniques. The image quality score of SW-CG-HYPR was significantly higher than that of SR-Turbo-FLASH ( 3.4 ± 0.6 vs 3.0 ± 0.7 , respectively; p < 0.05). In the per-patient analysis , SW-CG-HYPR provided a higher sensitivity ( 94 % vs 89 %) , specificity ( 83 % vs 75 %) , and diagnostic accuracy ( 90 % vs 83 %) for the detection of CAD than SR-Turbo-FLASH. In the per-vessel analysis , the diagnostic performance of SW-CG-HYPR was significantly greater than that of SR-Turbo-FLASH for the overall detection of CAD ( area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.96 ± 0.02 vs 0.90 ± 0.03 , respectively; p < 0.05). Whole left ventricular coverage myocardial perfusion MRI has higher diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional 3-slice technique for the detection of suspected CAD.
