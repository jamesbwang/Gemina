  Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory<disease> Syndrome<disease> ( PRRS) , caused by PRRS virus ( PRRSV) , is one of the most important devastating diseases of pigs , characterized by reproductive failure in sows , and respiratory<disease> disease<disease> with heavy mortality in piglets. PRRS virus has been reported to elevate the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum of infected pigs. High Mobility Group Box-1 ( HMGB-1) protein is a cellular biomolecule belonging to the Danger Associated Molecular Patterns ( DAMP) family , which stimulates immune cells to release pro-inflammatory cytokines upon release out of cells. The role of HMGB-1 in the pathogenesis of PRRSV remains largely unknown. In the present study , HMGB-1 levels in serum samples collected from six-week-old piglets infected intra-nasally with 2 Ã— 10
