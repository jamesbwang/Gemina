  Rhinologic and oral maxillofacial complications from scuba diving are common , representing approximately 35 % of head and neck pathology related to diving. We performed a systematic and comprehensive literature review on the pathophysiology , diagnosis , and treatment of rhinologic and oral maxillofacial pathology related to diving. This included complications due to sinus barotrauma , barodontalgia , odontocrexis , temporomandibular joint dysfunction , partially dentulous patients , and considerations for patients following major head and neck surgery. Of 113 papers accessed , 32 were included in the final synthesis. We created a succinct summary on each topic that should inform clinical decision making by otolaryngologists , dive medicine specialists and primary care providers when faced with pathology of these anatomic sub-sites.
