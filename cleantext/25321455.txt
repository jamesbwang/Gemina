  We describe the case of a 53-year-old woman who visited many pneumologists without a diagnosis until finally being diagnosed with diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia<disease> ( DIPNECH). It is a relatively new disease characterized by neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia<disease> in small airways. She has stable DIPNECH and neuroendocrine carcinoma with somatostatin therapy.
