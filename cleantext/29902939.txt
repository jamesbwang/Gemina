  Investigate the feasibility of a nurse-led mobility protocol and compare the effects of once- versus twice-daily episodes of early therapeutic mobility ( ETM) and low- versus moderate-intensity ETM on serum biomarkers of inflammation<symptom> and selected outcomes in critically ill adults. Randomized interventional study with repeated measures and blinded assessment of outcomes. Four adult intensive care units ( ICUs) in two academic medical centers. Fifty-four patients with > 48 hr of mechanical ventilation ( MV). Patients were assigned to once- or twice-daily ETM via sealed envelope randomization at enrollment. Intensity of ( in-bed vs. out-of-bed) ETM was administered according to protocolized patient assessment. Interleukins 6 , 10 , 8 , 15 , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-Î± were collected from serum before and after ETM; change scores were used in the analyses. Manual muscle and handgrip strength , delirium<symptom> onset , duration of MV , and ICU length of stay ( LOS) were evaluated as patient outcomes. Hypotheses regarding the inflammatory biomarkers were not supported based on confidence intervals. Twice-daily intervention was associated with reduced ICU LOS. Moderate-intensity ( out-of-bed) ETM was associated with greater manual muscle test scores and handgrip strength and reduced occurrence of delirium<symptom>. Findings from this study suggest that nurses can provide twice-daily mobility interventions that include sitting on the edge of the bed once patients have a stable status without altering a pro-inflammatory serum biomarker profile.
