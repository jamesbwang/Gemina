  This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy ( CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) when administered on a daily basis during a 2-week period of time. In an open-label , prospective cohort pilot trial , 20 U.S. military personnel and veterans diagnosed with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD participated in 12 daily sessions of CPT. Primary outcomes included Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 scores. Secondary outcomes included Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation ( BSSI) scores. Interviews and self-report scales were completed at pretreatment , posttreatment , and 6 months after the treatment. Relative to baseline , PTSD symptom severity and rates of PTSD diagnosis were significantly reduced at posttreatment and 6-month follow-up. Depression<symptom> symptom severity did not significantly improve , but suicide ideation significantly decreased at 6-month follow-up. Daily administration of CPT is associated with significant reductions in PTSD and suicide ideation.
