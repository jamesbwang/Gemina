  We report on a comprehensive measurement system for mobility and energy states of charge carriers in matter under dynamic chemical doping. The temporal evolution of the iodine doping process of poly ( 3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT) was monitored directly through electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR) and optical absorption spectroscopy , as well as differential electrical conductivity by the microwave conductivity measurement. The increase in conductivity was observed after the EPR intensity reached a maximum and declined thereafter , and the conductivity finally reached âˆ¼ 80 S cm
