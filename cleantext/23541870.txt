  Fracture of the tibial tray is a rarely observed complication of total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) , predominately in implants placed greater than a decade ago. This case highlights a case of baseplate fracture in a contemporary prosthesis. The patient presented 1 year after TKA with medial knee pain consistent with pes bursitis. The implant-cement-bone construct was intact and she was managed with corticosteroids. She had persistent pain , acutely developed new varus deformity , and presented with a tibial tray fracture. Retrieval analysis suggested fatigue<symptom> fracture as the likely mechanism. At time of revision , necrotic bone was found at the medial plateau , which likely caused cantilever bending relative to the well-supported portion of the tray and resultant failure. The patient continues to do well 5 years after revision TKA.
