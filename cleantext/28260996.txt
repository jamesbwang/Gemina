  Relative valuation of potentially affected ecosystem benefits can increase the legitimacy and social acceptance of ecosystem restoration projects. As an alternative or supplement to traditional methods of deriving beneficiary preference , we downloaded from social media and classified â‰ˆ 21,000 photographs taken in two Great Lakes Areas of Concern ( AOC) , the St.<disease> Louis River and the Milwaukee Estuary. Our motivating presumption was that the act of taking a photograph constitutes some measure of the photographer 's individual preference for , or choice of , the depicted subject matter among myriad possible subject matter. Overall , 17 % of photos downloaded from the photo-sharing sites Flickr , Instagram , and Panoramio depicted an ecosystem benefit of the AOC. Percent of photographs depicting a benefit and the photographs ' subject matter varied between AOCs and among photo-sharing sites. Photos shared on Instagram were less user-gender biased than other photo-sharing sites and depicted active recreation ( e.g. , trail use) more frequently than passive recreation ( e.g. , landscape viewing). Local users shared more photos depicting a benefit than non-local users. The spatial distribution of photograph locations varied between photos depicting and not depicting a benefit , and identified areas within AOCs from which few photographs were shared. As a source of beneficiary preference information , we think Instagram has some advantages over the other photo-sharing sites. When combined with other information , spatially-explicit relative valuation derived from aggregate social preference can be translated into information and knowledge useful for Great Lakes restoration decision making.
