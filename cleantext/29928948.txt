  Total-body irradiation ( TBI) is a major constituent of myeloablative conditioning regimens. The standard technique consists of 12Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days. The SARASIN study aimed to compare standard-fractionation to one-daily fractionation prior to transplant in leukemia<disease>. We retrospectively compared TBI regimens delivered in 2993 patients from the EBMT database , transplanted between 2000 and 2014 for acute lymphoblastic ( ALL , n = 1729) or acute myelogenous ( AML , n = 1264) leukemia<disease>. TBI was delivered as either 12Gy in 6 fractions ( group 1: considered as the reference group; ALL , n = 1362 and AML , n = 857) , or 9-12Gy in 2 fractions ( group 2; ALL , n = 173 and AML , n = 256) , or 12Gy in 3-4 fractions ( group 3; ALL , n = 194 and AML , n = 151). The median follow-up was 60 and 84 months in ALL and AML patients , respectively. At 5-years , leukemia-free survival , overall survival , relapse incidence and non-relapse mortality were 46.6 % , 50.4 % , 28.8 % , 24.6 % in ALL and 46.6 % , 48.9 % , 29.7 % and 23.6 % in AML , respectively. In multivariate analyses , outcomes of groups 2 and 3 were not statistically different from group 1. Cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies ( SMs) was significantly higher in group 2 ( 7.2 %) ( group 2 versus 1 , p < 10 We showed that 12Gy-FTBI dose delivered either in 2 or in one fraction per day over 3-4 days resulted in non-significant difference disease control and survival. However , one-day fractionation may be associated with a higher risk of mucositis and hemorrhagic cystitis<disease> The absence of significant difference in SMs incidence in the non-T-cell depleted group should be interpreted with caution in the context of a retrospective study design. Our findings are important to consider for radiotherapy departments organization. In depth analyses of other non-lethal toxicities and late effects are required.
