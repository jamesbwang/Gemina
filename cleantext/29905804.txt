  This article reports the concentrations of gamma-hydroxybutyrate ( GHB) in femoral blood and bladder urine in a case series of drug intoxication deaths ( N = 37). GHB was determined in blood ( B-GHB) and urine ( U-GHB) by a GC-FID-GBL method and 30 mg/L was used as a cut-off concentration for reporting positive results. The mean ( median) and range of GHB concentrations in bladder urine were 2,818 mg/L ( 1,900 mg/L) and 120-13,000 mg/L , respectively. These concentrations were appreciably higher than those in femoral blood , 637 mg/L ( 260 mg/L) and 30-9,200 mg/L , respectively. Urine/blood ratios of GHB were highly variable ( mean 8.99 , median 5.33 and range 0.16-29.3). GHB is rapidly metabolized and cleared from the bloodstream , whereas there is no metabolism occurring in the urinary bladder. In five autopsy cases , U-GHB was lower than B-GHB , which suggests that these individuals died before equilibration of the drug in all body fluids and tissues. In the other 32 deaths , U-GHB was higher than B-GHB , sometimes appreciably higher , which points towards a longer survival time after intake or administration of GHB. The analysis of urine extends the window of detection of GHB by several hours compared with blood samples , depending in part on when the bladder was last voided before death. Furthermore , the urinary concentration of GHB gives a hint about the concentration in blood during the time that the urine was produced in the kidney and stored in the bladder since the previous void.
