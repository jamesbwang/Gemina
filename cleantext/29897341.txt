  In this study , a new method was reported for the fabrication of the nanostructured CuO/Al thermite film on a Cu substrate. The CuO nanorod ( NR) arrays grew vertically from the Cu surfaces by electrochemical anodization processes , followed by the deposition of an Al layer on the CuO NRs via magnetron sputtering to form a core/shell CuO/Al nanothermite film , whose component , structure and morphology were subsequently characterized. In addition , the energy-release characteristics of the obtained nanothermite film were investigated using thermal analyses and laser ignition tests. All evidence demonstrates that the obtained CuO/Al is of a uniform structure and has superb energy performance. Impressively , the resulting material is potentially useful in applications of functional energetic chips due to its easy integration with microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS) technologies.
