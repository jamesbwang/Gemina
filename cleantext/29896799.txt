  The association between pulp necrosis<symptom> and crown discoloration in traumatized primary teeth has not been clearly determined yet. The study verified whether there is an association of pulp necrosis<symptom> and crown discoloration in traumatized primary teeth through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/Medline , Lilacs/BBO , Scopus , Web of Science , Cochrane Library databases , and grey literature. A methodological quality assessment appraisal was independently conducted by two researchers. Random-effects models were employed , and heterogeneity was tested ( I Eight studies with low risk of bias were included in the analysis. A total of 1,494 traumatized primary teeth participated in the pooled meta-analysis. Diagnosis of pulp necrosis<symptom> was evaluated in 1,414 teeth through clinical and/or radiographic analyses , and the analysis demonstrated a positive association ( P = 0.0005/ OR 8.37 ( 2.51 , 27.90) , I The positive association between pulp necrosis<symptom> and crown discoloration should be considered with caution once the diagnosis of pulp necrosis<symptom> was performed by limited criteria.
