  Senataxin ( SETX) is a DNA-RNA helicase whose C-terminal region shows homology to the helicase domain of the yeast protein Sen1p. Genetic discoveries have established the importance of SETX for neural function , as recessive mutations in the SETX gene cause Ataxia<symptom> with Oculomotor Apraxia type 2 ( AOA2) ( OMIM: 606002) , which is the third most common form of recessive ataxia<symptom> , after Friedreich 's ataxia<symptom> and Ataxia-Telangiectasia. In addition , rare , dominant SETX mutations cause a juvenile-onset form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS) , known as ALS4. SETX performs a number of RNA regulatory functions , including maintaining RNA transcriptome homeostasis. Over the last decade , altered RNA regulation and aberrant RNA-binding protein function have emerged as a central theme in motor neuron disease pathogenesis , with evidence suggesting that sporadic ALS disease pathology may overlap with the molecular pathology uncovered in familial ALS. Like other RNA processing proteins linked to ALS , the basis for SETX gain-of-function motor neuron toxicity remains ill-defined. Studies of yeast Sen1p and mammalian SETX protein have revealed a range of important RNA regulatory functions , including resolution of R-loops to permit transcription termination , and RNA splicing. Growing evidence suggests that SETX may represent an important genetic modifier locus for sporadic ALS. In cycling cells , SETX is found at nuclear foci during the S/G
