  The ability to manipulate light-matter interaction in semiconducting nanostructures is fascinating for implementing functionalities in advanced optoelectronic devices. Here , we report the tailoring of radiative emissions in a ZnTe/ZnTe :O/ ZnO core-shell single nanowire coupled with a one-dimensional aluminum bowtie antenna array. The plasmonic antenna enables changes in the excitation and emission processes , leading to an obvious enhancement of near band edge emission ( 2.2 eV) and subgap excitonic emission ( 1.7 eV) bound to intermediate band states in a ZnTe/ZnTe :O/ ZnO core-shell nanowire as well as surface-enhanced Raman scattering at room temperature. The increase of emission decay rate in the nanowire/antenna system , probed by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy , yields an observable enhancement of quantum efficiency induced by local surface plasmon resonance. Electromagnetic simulations agree well with the experimental observations , revealing a combined effect of enhanced electric near-field intensity and the improvement of quantum efficiency in the ZnTe/ZnTe :O/ ZnO nanowire/antenna system. The capability of tailoring light-matter interaction in low-efficient emitters may provide an alternative platform for designing advanced optoelectronic and sensing devices with precisely controlled response.
