  Accurate characterization of Carbon ( C) consequences of forest<disease> disturbances and management is critical for informed climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. While research into generalized properties of the forest<disease> C cycle informs policy and provides abstract guidance to managers , most management occurs at local scales and relies upon monitoring systems that can consistently provide C cycle assessments that explicitly apply to a defined time and place. We used an inventory-based forest<disease> monitoring and simulation tool to quantify C storage effects of actual fires , timber harvests , and forest<disease> regeneration conditions in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem ( GYE). Results show that ( 1) the 1988 fires had a larger impact on GYE 's C storage than harvesting during 1985-2011; ( 2) continuation of relatively high harvest rates of the region 's National Forest land , which declined after 1990 , would have shifted the disturbance agent primary importance on those lands from fire to harvest; and ( 3) accounting for local heterogeneity of post-disturbance regeneration patterns translates into large regional effects on total C storage. Large fires in 1988 released about 8.3 ± 0.3 Mg/ha of C across Yellowstone National Park ( YNP , including both disturbed and undisturbed area) , compared with total C storage reductions due to harvest of about 2.3 ± 0.3 Mg/ha and 2.6 ± 0.2 Mg/ha in adjacent Caribou-Targhee and Gallatin National Forests , respectively , from 1985-2011. If the high harvest rates observed in 1985-1989 had been maintained through 2011 in GYE National Forests , the C storage effect of harvesting would have quintupled to 10.5 ± 1.0 Mg/ha , exceeding the immediate losses associated with YNP 's historic fire but not the longer-term net loss of carbon ( 16.9 ± 0.8 Mg/ha). Following stand-replacing disturbance such as the 1988 fires , the actual regeneration rate was slower than the default regional average rate assumed by empirically calibrated forest<disease> growth models. If regeneration following the 1988 fire had reached regionally average rates , either through different natural circumstances or through more active management , YNP would have had approximately 4.1 Mg/ha more forest<disease> carbon by year 2020. This study highlights the relative effects of fire disturbances and management activities on regional C storage , and demonstrates a forest<disease> carbon monitoring system that can be both applied consistently across the US and tailored to questions of specific local management interest.
