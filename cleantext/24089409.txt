  Combinatorial drug treatment strategies perturb biological networks synergistically to achieve therapeutic effects and represent major opportunities to develop advanced treatments across a variety of human<disease> disease<disease> areas. However , the discovery of new combinatorial treatments is challenged by the sheer scale of combinatorial chemical space. Here , we report a high-throughput system for nanoliter-scale phenotypic screening that formulates a chemical library in nanoliter droplet emulsions and automates the construction of chemical combinations en masse using parallel droplet processing. We applied this system to predict synergy between more than 4,000 investigational and approved drugs and a panel of 10 antibiotics against
