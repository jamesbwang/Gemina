  The present study investigated prevalence of integrase strand transfer inhibitors ( INSTI) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected antiretroviral therapy ( ART)- na√Øve patients in Korea. From 106 plasma samples , amplification and sequencing of integrase genes was performed , and major or minor mutations were calculated by the Stanford HIV<pathogen> drug resistance mutation interpretation algorithm. No major INSTI resistance mutations were found , and 14 minor mutations were detected in 13 ( 12.3 %) patients. The present data support the recommendation that routine testing for INSTI resistance mutations before starting ART is not necessary.
