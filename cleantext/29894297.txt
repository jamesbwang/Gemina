  Bacteria and archaea are evolutionarily distinct prokaryotes that diverged from a common ancestor billions of years ago. However , both bacteria and archaea assemble long , helical protein filaments on their surface through a machinery that is conserved at its core. In both domains of life , the filaments are required for a diverse array of important cellular processes including cell motility , adhesion , communication and biofilm formation. In this review , we highlight the recent structures of both the type IV pilus machinery and the archaellum determined in situ. We describe the current level of functional understanding and discuss how this relates to the pressures facing bacteria and archaea throughout evolution.
