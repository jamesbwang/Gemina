  infection with the hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients with hemophilia. Finally , patients are considered for a liver transplantation ( LT) due to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). we report the cases of congenital coagulopathy and HCV<pathogen> infection that underwent LT in our institution. There were three patients with hemophilia A and one patient with von Willebrand disease ( vWD) type 3. The coagulopathy outcome , perioperative management , factor and blood product usage and post-transplant survival were assessed. The deficient factor was initially administered in a direct bolus one hour before surgery with a target level of 100 IU/dl , which was sustained until stable hemostasis was reached. all three patients with hemophilia A were cured of their coagulopathy following transplantation. Factor VIII ( FVIII) was 93 IU/dl at eleven years , 59 IU/dl at 13 months and 109 IU/dl at nine months post-transplant , in each case. The mean perioperative usage of FVIII concentrates was 175 IU/kg; concentrates were infused for an average of 36 hours post-transplant. The natural course of the bleeding symptoms of the patient with type-3 vWD was attenuated , with no detectable hemostatic levels of von Willebrand factor antigen ( vWF: Ag) after transplantation. after transplantation , hemophilia A cure and improved bleeding phenotype of type-3 vWD reduced morbidity and mortality. However , potential graft reinfection with HCV<pathogen> and relapsing HCC cast a shadow over these optimum results.
