  We propose a new reliable transverse sinus stenosis ( TSS) index based on magnetic resonance venography ( MRV) for the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH). Our quantitative semi-automatic measurement analysis based on segmentation and cross-sectional TS diameter from 48 IIH patients and controls matched for age and sex , had a good inter-observer agreement ( κ = 0.729) compared to a visual examination ( κ = 0.467). A cut-off point ≥ 2 discriminate IIH patients from controls , with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 %.
