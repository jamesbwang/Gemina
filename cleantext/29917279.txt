  Strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloadditions ( SPAAC) have proven extremely useful for labeling of biomolecules , but typically produce isomeric mixtures. This is not appropriate for the formation of bioactive molecules in living cells. Here , we report the first use of SPAAC for the isomer-free synthesis of a bioactive molecule , both in vitro and inside cultured cells. We developed the symmetrical cyclooctyne SYPCO and used it for the generation of a chemically uniform triazole inhibitor of protein-protein interactions mediated by Bcl-xL via isomer-free SPAAC ( iSPAAC). Tumor cells treated with the reactants of the iSPAAC reaction contained higher concentrations of triazole , and displayed higher apoptosis levels , than cells treated with pre-synthesized triazole. We envision iSPAAC as a broadly applicable method for modulating intracellular targets with organic molecules with molecular weights prohibitively large for cellular uptake , via smaller and thus more cell-permeable components.
