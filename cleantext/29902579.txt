  Androgen receptor ( AR) expression is an emerging prognostic marker that has been observed in 25 % to 75 % of triple negative breast cancers ( TNBCs) that lack estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor and HER2 overexpression. TNBCs are treated with AR-targeted therapies and standardized evaluation of AR expression may help guide patient management. Basal-like TNBCs are a subgroup of TNBCs defined by positive immunoreactivity for CK5/6 or EGFR that carry a worse prognosis. However , it 's unclear whether basal-like TNBCs have a different rate of AR positivity or if AR expression is predictive of disease free survival in this patient group. Here we examined a total of 185 TNBCs for AR and CK5/6 using tissue microarrays ( TMAs). Among all samples , 32 % were AR-positive using a 1 % cutoff and 24 % were AR-positive using a 10 % cutoff. Ninety ( 49 %) TNBCs were CK5/6-positive with lower intensity of AR expression compared to CK5/6- negative cases. There was no significant difference in pathologic stage , tumor size , histologic grade and type , or lymph node stage after stratifying by AR and CK5/6 positivity. AR-positive TNBCs had better overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS) compared to AR-negative TNBCs. In addition , increased AR expression carried a dose-dependent effect on DFS. AR expression , nodal status and tumor size were significant predictors of disease free and overall survival in a multivariable model adjusted for CK5/6 expression , age , histologic grade , and mitotic rate. In conclusion , our data demonstrated that AR-positivity is a favorable prognostic factor for triple negative breast cancers.
