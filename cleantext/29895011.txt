  To determine the rate of macular holes ( MH) occurring in the fellow eyes of eyes with MH depending on the vitreomacular interface at baseline. This was a retrospective study of patients operated on for idiopathic MH , with persistent vitreofoveal attachment in the fellow eye assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT). Follow-up lasted 6 months or more , and the main outcome was the occurrence of an MH. The 77 fellow eyes included had a mean follow-up of 34.11 Â± 22.3 months ( 6-78.4). At baseline , 31 eyes had vitreomacular traction ( VMT) , 35 vitreomacular adhesion , and 11 no posterior vitreous detachment. MH occurred in 19.5 % of the cases ( 15/77). The rate of MH was significantly higher among the eyes with VMT than among the eyes without VMT at baseline ( 35.5 vs. 8.7 %; p = 0.009). One-third of eyes with VMT at baseline identified by SD-OCT will develop an MH in the following 5 years.
