  Lead exposure has been evidenced as a risk factor for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , mainly affecting the ageing. However , the early manifestation and mechanisms of AD-like pathology induced by lead exposure remains to be elucidated. Considering the fact that impaired cholesterol metabolism is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders including AD , in this study we focused on the role of cholesterol metabolism in lead induced premature AD-like pathology. We treated weaning rats with lead at different concentrations for 4 weeks. We found that developmental lead exposure increased amyloid-beta ( AÎ²) accumulation and amyloid plaque deposition in the cortex and hippocampus. Lead exposure increased amyloid precursor protein ( APP) expression and activated the sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 ( SREBP2)- beta secretase ( BACE1) pathway. In addition , we found that lead exposure decreased cholesterol levels by upregulating the expression of liver X receptor-a ( LXR-a) and ATP-binding cassette transporter protein family member A1 ( ABCA1) and decreasing the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase ( HMG-CR) and low density lipoprotein receptor ( LDL-R) in young rat brain tissues. Taken together , our data demonstrated that developmental lead exposure induced early manifestation of AD-like pathology and disturbed cholesterol metabolism in young rat brains.
