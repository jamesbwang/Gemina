  Up to date , the electronic and optical properties of WS2 and WSe2 have been widely explored. However , the synthesis and characterization of their ternary alloy nanosheets have been rarely reported. Here , we fabricated single layer W ( SxSe1-x) 2 nanosheets by a one-step chemical vapor deposition ( CVD) method. It is demonstrated that exciton emission behavior of single layer W ( SxSe1-x) 2 nanosheets ( 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) can be remarkably tuned by changing the sulfur content. The theoretical calculations proved that single layer W ( SxSe1-x) 2 alloy has a direct gap , and the band gap can be tuned by the sulfur content , which is in accordance with the spectral experiments. Moreover , we present temperature-dependent photoluminescence ( PL) measurements in monolayers of W ( SxSe1-x) 2 alloys from 80 K to 320 K. The neutral exciton ( X) and charged exciton ( trion , T) can be observed at all measured temperatures. In sulfur-rich ternary W ( SxSe1-x) 2 alloys , the trion dominates the PL spectra at low temperatures while the exciton dominates the PL spectra at higher temperatures. In selenium-rich ternary alloys , however , the exciton is dominant in PL spectra at all measured temperatures. As the sulfur content gradually increases , the intensity ratio of the trion to exciton becomes dramatically larger. There is an obvious upward trend of the trion intensity in W ( SxSe1-x) 2 monolayers , which results from the significant growth of the two-dimensional electron gas ( 2DEG) concentration. On the other hand , the strong exciton-trion coupling mediated by an optical phonon also contributes to this improvement. These results indicate that exciton emission behavior of W ( SxSe1-x) 2 monolayers is controllable with the sulfur content. It highlights the importance of further detailed characterization on exciton features in ternary alloy nanosheets , and can enable spectral tunability for potential optoelectronic applications.
