  Mounting evidence has associated high sodium intake with hypertension , cardiovascular disease and stroke. We investigated whether high sodium intake modulates the parameters of endothelial damage , inflammation<symptom> and oxidative stress. We used a cross-sectional study design including 223 Chilean subjects ( 6.9-65.0 years old). We measured aldosterone , renin activity , cortisol , cortisone , adiponectin , leptin , hs-CRP , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , PAI-1 , metalloproteinase ( MMP) -9 and MMP-2 activity and malondialdehyde ( MDA). Sodium and creatinine were measured in 24-h urine samples. The subjects were divided by sodium intake: high ( HS): â‰¥ 150 mEq/day , n = 118 , and adequate ( AS): < 150 mEq/day , n = 105. We observed a positive correlation between urinary sodium excretion and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( r = 0.1669 , p = 0.0124 for systolic and r = 0.2416 , p = 0.0003 for diastolic) , glycemia ( r = 0.2660 , p < 0.0001) , and triglycerides ( r = 0.1604 , p = 0.0175) and a highly significant correlation between sodium excretion and PAI-1 ( r = 0.2701 , p < 0.0001). An inverse correlation was observed between urinary sodium and HDL-cholesterol ( r = -0.2093 , p = 0.0018) and adiponectin ( r = -0.2679 , p < 0.0001). In a linear regression model , urinary sodium excretion remained significantly associated with PAI-1 values even after adjusting for age , gender and BMI. The HS group had higher blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , glycemia , HOMA , atherogenic index of plasma and PAI-1 values than the group with adequate sodium intake. High sodium intake is associated with endothelial damage ( high PAI-1) and metabolic dysregulation. On the other hand , inflammation<symptom> and oxidative stress parameters are not modified by sodium intake.
