  We investigated the emission properties of a photostable luminescent organic radical , ( 3,5-dichloro-4-pyridyl) bis ( 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl) methyl radical ( PyBTM) , doped into host molecular crystals. The 0.05 wt %- doped crystals displayed luminescence attributed to a PyBTM monomer with a room-temperature emission quantum yield of 89 % , which is exceptionally high among organic radicals. The 10 wt %- doped crystals exhibited both PyBTM monomer and excimer-centered emission bands , and the intensity ratio of these two bands was modulated drastically by applying a magnetic field of up to 18 T at 4.2 K. This is the first observation of a magnetic field affecting the luminescence of organic radicals , and we also proposed a mechanism for this effect.
