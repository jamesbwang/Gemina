  In Australia , there is an unmet need for improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of RA. To provide an overview of key study outcomes for tofacitinib in Australian patients , we analyzed the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in the Australian subpopulation of global RA phase III and long-term extension ( LTE) studies. Data were pooled from the Australian subpopulation of four phase III studies and one LTE study ( database not locked at cut-off date: January 2016). Patients in the phase III studies received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily ( BID) , placebo ( advancing to tofacitinib at months 3 or 6) , or adalimumab , with background methotrexate or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients in the LTE study received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID. Efficacy endpoints were American College of Rheumatology ( ACR) 20/50/70 response rates , and change from baseline in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( DAS28-4 ( ESR)) and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index ( HAQ-DI) scores. Safety endpoints included incidence of adverse events ( AEs) , serious AEs , and discontinuations due to AEs. AEs of special interest and laboratory parameters were analyzed in the LTE study. Across phase III studies ( N = 100) , ACR response rates and improvements in DAS28-4 ( ESR) and HAQ-DI scores were numerically greater with tofacitinib vs. placebo at month 3 , and increased until month 12. The results were sustained in the LTE study ( N = 99) after 60 months ' observation. In general , the efficacy and safety profiles of tofacitinib were similar to those of the global RA population. In Australian patients with RA , tofacitinib therapy demonstrated sustained efficacy and consistent safety over â‰¥ 60 months ' treatment. Pfizer Inc..
