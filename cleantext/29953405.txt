  Objective Medical students and professionals report receiving limited education/training related to treating eating disorders. Because medical professionals are the point of initial contact for these patients and are involved necessarily in their treatment , sufficient knowledge on identification and intervention are imperative. This research set out to examine the impact of the eating disorder education and experience offered through a 1-month Adolescent Medicine rotation at a medical university on medical student/resident self-efficacy. Methods The 1-month rotation includes a standardized patient ( SP) simulation , 1.5 h of didactic education , and 1 day observing the MD , nutritionist and psychologist within the outpatient Multidisciplinary Child/Adolescent Eating Disorders Clinic. All residents ' ( n = 132) eating disorder self-efficacy was assessed before ( PRE) completing simulation and didactic session and again at the end of the 1-month rotation ( END). Self-efficacy was also assessed after simulation and before the didactic session for group 1 ( n = 92) and after simulation and didactic session for group 2 ( n = 40). Results For group 1 , self-efficacy was not significantly impacted PRE to POST. For group 2 , self-efficacy significantly improved PRE to POST. POST to END changes were significant for both groups; however , group 2 scored significantly better across all self-efficacy areas at END. Conclusion Resident training in eating disorders requires more than is offered in many residency programs. SP simulation is strengthened as an effective training tool in assessing and promoting resident self-efficacy if it is followed by didactic education. Clinical observation and extended practice that includes ongoing guidance/feedback on performance is recommended in fostering self-efficacy.
