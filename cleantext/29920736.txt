  The primary aim of this study was to assess the individual effects of probenecid and cimetidine on mirogabalin exposure. This phase 1 , open-label , crossover study randomized healthy adults to receive three treatment regimens , each separated by â‰¥ 5-day washout: a single oral dose of mirogabalin 15 mg on day 2 , mirogabalin 15 mg on day 2 plus probenecid 500 mg every 6 hours from days 1-4 , and mirogabalin 15 mg on day 2 plus cimetidine 400 mg every 6 hours from days 1-4. Coadministration of mirogabalin with probenecid or cimetidine increased the maximum and total mirogabalin exposure. The geometric mean ratios of C A greater magnitude of change in mirogabalin exposure was observed when coadministered with a drug that inhibits both renal and metabolic clearance ( probenecid) vs a drug that only affects renal clearance ( cimetidine). However , as the increase in exposure is not clinically significant ( > 2-fold) , no a priori dose adjustment is recommended.
