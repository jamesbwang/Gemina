  Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) are considered fundamental in various physiological/pathophysiological processes and prevention/treatment measures such as hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO) therapy. In this study , the origination of ROS in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was investigated under basal and HBO conditions. Whole cell or mitochondria-targeted fluorescent probes were applied to mark superoxide anion ( O2-) , and the ROS produced from mitochondrial respiratory chain ( MRC) , NADPH oxidase ( NOX) and xanthine oxidase ( XO) were identified by flow cytometry , confocal imaging and microplate fluorometry with or without specific inhibitors. An algorithm was established to calculate ROS proportion of each source. HBO increased ROS to about 2.14-2.44 fold in mitochondria and 1.32-1.42 fold in whole cell. Then ROS levels were significantly decreased by MRC inhibition about 30 % and 16 % , respectively. NOX or XO inhibition did not affect HBO-induced ROS generation. Based on these data , it could be further estimated that mitochondrial ROS accounted for 32 % -39 % of basal whole-cell ROS including 3 % from MRC complex II , and NOX accounted for at least 24 % -29 %. Following HBO treatment , almost all increased ROS originated from mitochondria , and MRC complex II contributed at least 45 % -60 %. This study provided a simple but effective method to estimate the origination of intracellular ROS and found that MRC were the main source of HBO-induced ROS generation.
