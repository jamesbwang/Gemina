  international guidelines recommend a routine colonoscopy to rule out advanced neoplasm after an acute diverticulitis event. However , in recent years , this recommendation has been called into question following the advent of computerized tomography ( CT) , particularly with regard to uncomplicated diverticulitis. Furthermore , colonoscopy is associated with a risk and additional costs. to understand the diagnostic yield , quality and safety of colonoscopy in the setting of acute diverticulitis. this was a retrospective study of all patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis via CT between 2005 and 2013 , who subsequently underwent a colonoscopy. two hundred and sixteen patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis via CT were enrolled. These included 58 cases with complicated diverticulitis ( 27 %) and 158 with uncomplicated diverticulitis ( 73 %). An advanced neoplasm was found in 12 patients ( 5.6 %); 11.7 % were complicated and 3.2 % were uncomplicated ( p = 0.02). No major complications were identified. The quality was low but improved over time; the complete procedure rate was 88 % , an effective preparation was achieved in 75 % and excision of polyps < 2 cm was performed in 78 % of cases. The optimum colonoscopy quality cu-off was 9.5 weeks. routine colonoscopy is advisable after a complicated diverticulitis event but its recommendation is unclear with regard to uncomplicated episodes. Colonoscopy is safe even when performed early. The overall quality is low but may be optimized via a subsequent endoscopy , two months after a diverticulitis diagnosis.
