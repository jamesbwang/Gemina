  Dysregulation of protein kinase-mediated signaling is an early event in many diseases , including the most common clinical cardiac arrhythmia , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). Kinomic profiling represents a promising technique to identify candidate kinases. Here we employ kinomic profiling to identify kinases altered in AF remodeling using atrial tissue from a canine AF-model ( atrial tachypacing). Left atrial tissue obtained in a previous canine study was used for kinome array ( containing 1024 kinase pseudo-substrates) analysis. Three groups of dogs were included: non-paced controls ( C) and atrial tachypaced ( TP) dogs , which were contrasted with geranylgeranylacetone ( GGA) treated AF dogs , which are protected from AF promotion , to enhance specificity of detection of putative kinases. While TP changed activity of 50 kinases , 40 of these were prevented by GGA and involved in differentiation and proliferation ( SRC) , contraction , metabolism , immunity , development , cell cycle ( CDK4) and survival ( Akt). Inhibitors of Akt ( MK2206) and CDK4 ( PD0332991) and overexpression of a dominant negative CDK4 phosphorylation mutant protected against tachypacing-induced contractile dysfunction in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Moreover , AF patients show down- and upregulation of SRC and Akt phosphorylation , respectively , similar to findings of the kinome array. Contrasting kinomic array analyses of control and treated subject offers a versatile tool to identify kinases altered in atrial remodeling due to tachypacing , which include Akt , CDK4 and SRC. Ultimately , pharmacological targeting of altered kinases may offer novel therapeutic possibilities to treat clinical AF.
