  Greater aortic stiffness and pulse pressure are associated with cerebrovascular remodeling , reduced white matter microstructure , and cognitive performance with aging in humans. However , it is unclear whether aortic stiffness and pulse pressure are associated with reduced basal global cerebral blood flow ( CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve among older adults. Global CBF was quantified in 205 adults ( range , 19-87 years; mean ± SE: 30.6 ± 1.3 years) using quantitative (
