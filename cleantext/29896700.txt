  Amphibian embryos have long served as an ideal model for teratogenicity testing. While whole-mount embryo observations can be utilized , histological observation of teratogenic phenotypes provides a wealth of additional information that can lead to mechanistic insights. In this chapter , detailed protocols for two methods of sectioning embryos as well as a guide for histological analysis is provided.
