  We investigated the prevalence of and risk factors for antibodies to HLA in 1663 haploidentical transplant candidates. Among these cases , 349 ( 21.0 %) showed positive panel-reactive antibody ( PRA) either for class I or class II HLA. Multivariate analysis showed the following: i) risk factors associated with the prevalence of PRA either for class I or class II HLA were female gender ( P = 0.018) , prior transfusions ( P < 0.001) or pregnancy ( P < 0.001) , and cases with MDS ( P = 0.018); compared to other patients , subjects with ALL had a lower prevalence of class I antibodies ( P = 0.017); and ii) risk factors associated with the prevalence of PRA both for class I and class II HLA were female gender ( P = 0.014) , prior transfusions ( P = 0.003) , previous pregnancy ( P < 0.001) , and diagnosis with MDS ( P = 0.035). The percentages of antibodies against different antigens coded by the different HLA loci , including HLA-A ,- B ,- C ,- DP ,- DQ , and- DR , among all cases were 15.6 % , 17.3 % , 10.5 % , 5.6 % , 8.5 % , and 9.7 % , respectively. Risk factors associated with specific antibodies against HLA-A ,- B ,- C ,- DP ,- DQ , and- DR were female gender , prior transfusion , previous pregnancy , and underlying disease. Our findings suggest that gender , prior pregnancy , transfusion and underlying diseases are risk factors for HLA sensitization , which could guide HLA antibody monitor and donor selection.
