  Abiotic stresses in plants are often transient , and the recovery phase following stress removal is critical. Flooding , a major abiotic stress that negatively impacts plant biodiversity and agriculture , is a sequential stress where tolerance is strongly dependent on viability underwater and during the postflooding period. Here we show that in
