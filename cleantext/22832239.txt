  Acute mastoiditis<disease> is the main suppurative complication of acute otitis<disease> media<disease> Its incidence ranges from 1.2 to 4.2/ 100.000 children/year and a rise has been reported in the last years. There are controversial data regarding risk factors for mastoiditis<disease> and its complications. to evaluate demographics and clinical characteristics of children with acute mastoiditis<disease> and to identify possible risk factors for complications. We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of all the children aged 1 month-14 years admitted to our Paediatric Emergency Department from January 2002 to December 2016. One hundred forty-seven cases ( 97 males and 50 females) were included in the analysis , mean age was 4.8 Â± 3.6 years and 28.2 % of the patients were younger than 2 years. We found an increasing number of mastoiditis<disease> per year during the last 3 years of the study. Children younger than 2 years were less treated with antibiotics for acute otitis<disease> media<disease> or treated for a shorter period ( p < 0.05) , while they were treated at higher antibiotic 's dosage for mastoiditis<disease> ( p < 0.01). Older children presented more frequently with symptoms such as earache or retroauricular pain ( p < 0.0001 , p < 0.001). We did n't identify any risk factor for mastoiditis<disease> complications in our study. Despite the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines , the incidence of acute mastoiditis<disease> in our population has not been reduced during the last years. We have to face all the reasons why this condition is still relevant , such as antibiotic resistance , new pathogens involved and a possible role played by the implementations of therapeutic acute otitis<disease> media<disease> guidelines restricting the use of antibiotics in this disease. A particular attention should be given to younger children where signs and symptoms may be less pronounced , therefore acute otitis<disease> media<disease> or mastoiditis<disease> may be misunderstood and appropriate treatment delayed.
