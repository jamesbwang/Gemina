  This study aims to contribute toward a better understanding of the current biodiversity patterns existing in the Atlantic Forest of the state of Rio de Janeiro from a paleo-ecological approach. Three soil profiles , each formed from distinct source materials under varied climate and vegetation conditions were selected from the coastal regions of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil. Soil horizon samples for chemical and physical characterization were collected from 10 cm-interval depths , and the total organic carbon was determined in addition to performing isotype and phytolithic analyses. The phytolithic analysis associated with the isotopic techniques ( Î´
