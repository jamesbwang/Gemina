  Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> infection ( chlamydia<pathogen>) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial infection and causes significant reproductive morbidity in women. Little is known about how immunity to chlamydia<pathogen> develops in women , though animal models of chlamydia<pathogen> indicate that T-helper type 1 ( Th1) responses are important for chlamydia<pathogen> clearance and protective immunity , whereas T-helper type 2 ( Th2) responses are associated with persisting infection. In chlamydia-infected women , whether the predominant immune response is Th1- or Th2-polarizing remains controversial. To determine the cytokine profiles elicited by peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) from chlamydia-infected women , we stimulated PBMCs with C.<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> elementary bodies and recombinant C.<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> Pgp3 and measured supernatant levels of select cytokines spanning Th1- and Th2-polarizing responses. We found that stimulated PBMCs from chlamydia-infected women secreted cytokines that indicate strong Th1-polarizing responses , especially interferon-gamma , whereas Th2-polarizing cytokines were expressed at significantly lower levels. In chlamydia-infected women , the predominant cytokine responses elicited on stimulation of PBMCs with C.<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> antigens were Th1-polarizing , with interferon-gamma as the predominant cytokine.
