  The aim of this study was to investigate disease onset and disease progression in patients with severe chronic central serous chorioretinopathy ( cCSC). The medical records of 143 cCSC patients ( 199 eyes) were reviewed. All cases had visual complaints for > 6 months and showed signs of a severe disease phenotype on optical coherence tomography ( OCT) and fluorescein angiography ( FA). Clinical presentation at onset was evaluated , together with disease progression on multimodal imaging and final treatment outcome. Twenty-eight cases ( 14 %) had a documented history of an acute episode of CSC , whereas 145 cases ( 73 %) showed pre-existing features of chronicity already at first presentation. The first clinical presentation could not be evaluated in 13 % of cases. Best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) was 70 ± 18 Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS) letters at onset and 70 ± 22 ETDRS letters at final visit ( CSC encompasses a clinical spectrum that includes a range of severe phenotypes , in which retinal abnormalities tend to be progressive. Nevertheless , the long-term visual acuity may remain fairly stable with treatment. Few patients with severe chronic CSC have a history of acute CSC , which could indicate that there may be pathogenetic differences between these 2 CSC variants.
