  The aim of this study is to evaluate which of three arthroscopic knots are most reliably taught to and executed by residents at varying levels of training. Three arthroscopic knots , the Samsung Medical Center ( SMC) , the Weston , and the surgeon 's knot , were taught to 16 orthopaedic surgery residents. Each knot was tied in triplicate at two sessions 1 week apart. The knots were then biomechanically tested for strength. Corresponding knots tied by a sports medicine fellow served as the respective controls. Comparing all knots regardless of year of training , the SMC knot failed at significantly higher loads ( 237.2 ± 66.6 N) than the surgeon 's knot ( 203.7 ± 45.3 N , p = 0.049) and the Weston knot ( 193.5 ± 56.1 N , p = 0.013). No significant differences in knot strength were found when comparing knots tied by residents at different levels of training and when comparing residents to the sports medicine fellow. There was no difference in conditioning elongation between surgeon 's ( p = 0.343) , Weston ( p = 0.486) , or SMC knots ( p = 0.200) tied by post-graduate year one and five residents. We report the first study that evaluates the loop strength of an arthroscopically tied knot performed by orthopaedic surgery residents in various levels of training. In our cohort , the SMC knot required a higher load to failure , when compared to the Surgeon 's and Weston knot , after a simple arthroscopic knot tying curriculum. Based on these findings , he SMC knot should be considered as a part of future orthopaedic surgery resident arthroscopic training programs.
