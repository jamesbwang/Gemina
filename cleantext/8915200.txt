  Herein , we demonstrate the clinical results of closed reduction in a hyperextended supine position with transsacral-transiliac ( TSTI) and iliosacral ( IS) screw fixations for Denis zone III sacral fractures. Sixteen consecutive patients with Denis zone III sacral fractures who were treated between January 2009 and September 2016 were evaluated. All patients were treated using percutaneous TSTI/IS screw fixation during closed reduction performed with patients placed in a hyperextended supine position with body manipulation. The clinical and radiological results were evaluated , and the neurological outcomes were retrospectively assessed using Gibbon 's classification system. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the German Multicenter Study Group Pelvic Outcome Scale ( POS). The sacral kyphotic angle was reduced by 18.06 ° ± 15.26 ° ( mean kyphotic angle: pre-OP , 39.44 ° ± 20.56 °; post-OP , 21.38 ° ± 7.39 °) , and fracture translation was reduced by 5.93 ± 4.95 mm ( mean fracture translation: pre-OP , 8.69 ± 8.03 mm; post-OP 2.75 ± 3.97 mm). The mean initial Gibbon 's score was 3.00 ± 1.32. Among 15 patients with a follow-up duration of over 12 months , the mean reduction loss in the sacral kyphotic angle was 5.87 ° ± 10.40 ° and was 1.00 ± 3.00 mm for the fracture translation. The final Gibbon 's score was 1.80 ± 1.21 , and 73.3 % of patients had good results based on the POS score. Although closed reduction in a hyperextended supine position with percutaneous posterior screw fixation is associated with some surgical limitations and technical difficulties , the procedure is minimally invasive and highly effective for stabilizing Denis zone III sacral fractures.
