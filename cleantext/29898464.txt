  Stanford A acute aortic dissection ( AAD) is a life-threatening emergency. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of three different aortic entry tear sites on early outcomes and long-term survival of patients with Stanford A AAD. From January 2006 to April 2015 , a total of 240 consecutive patients with diagnosed Stanford A AAD underwent emergent , isolated surgical aortic repair in our center. Patients were divided into three groups comprising isolated ascending aorta , proximal aortic arch , and distal aortic arch entry tear site and were followed up for up to 9 years. Thirty-day mortality as well as major cerebrovascular events were significantly different between the three groups ( The location of the primary entry tear in patients with Stanford A AAD significantly influences early outcomes , short- and long-term survival of patients , whereas survival of patients free from major cerebrovascular events showed similar results among the three groups. Distal aortic entry tear site showed poorest outcomes and survival.
