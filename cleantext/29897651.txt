  Radiofrequency ( RF) coils are an essential MRI hardware component. They directly impact the spatial and temporal resolution , sensitivity , and uniformity in MRI. Advances in RF hardware have resulted in a variety of designs optimized for specific clinical applications. RF coils are the `` antennas '' of the MRI system and have two functions: first , to excite the magnetization by broadcasting the RF power ( Tx-Coil) and second to receive the signal from the excited spins ( Rx-Coil). Transmit RF Coils emit magnetic field pulses ( B1 +) to rotate the net magnetization away from its alignment with the main magnetic field ( B 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 6.
