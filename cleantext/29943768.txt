  Pneumoperitoneum in children may be due to causes that do not require urgent surgery ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres , severe respiratory pathology or mechanical ventilation). Surgery in these cases could even worsen the prognosis. We present the case of a male infant , ex-preterm , with a history of necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> and ileal perforation at birth , requiring laparotomy and intestinal resection on two occasions and developing a secondary microcolon , due to disuse. At six months , after transitioning to full oral feeding , he presented abdominal distension with extensive intestinal pneumatosis and pneumoperitoneum on radiographs. His general appearance was good with normal intestinal transit and no peritonitis<disease> The patient remained fasting with intravenous antibiotics , nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition. The evolution was favourable with oral feeding restarting on the seventh day of admission. The existence of pneumoperitoneum does not always require a laparotomy and global assessment of the patient by an interdisciplinary health team may avoid unnecessary aggressive treatments.
