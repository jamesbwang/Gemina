  Penconazole ( PEN) and tebuconazole ( TEB) are fungicides widely used in vineyards. The aim of this the study was to assess the suitability of hair to assess long-term exposure to PEN and TEB. Hair samples of agricultural workers exposed to PEN ( AW-PEN , 18 subjects) or TEB ( AW-TEB , 2 subjects) during the application of fungicides , agricultural workers relatives ( AR , 4 subjects) , and research staff technicians ( RS , 5 subjects) were collected before ( PRE-EXP) and after ( POST-EXP) the application season. PEN in PRE-EXP samples was quantifiable in all AW and AR ( medians from 1.4 to 7.9 pg/mg hair) and in one RS ( 1.4 pg/mg hair); PEN in POST-EXP samples was always quantifiable ( medians from 2.6 to 23.7 pg/mg hair) , with higher levels in AW. Comparing PRE- vs. POST-EXP samples , an increase in PEN level in AW and RS was found. TEB in PRE-EXP samples was quantifiable in most AW and AR ( median from 2.1 to 15.5 pg/mg hair) , but not in RS; TEB in POST-EXP samples was similarly quantifiable in AW and AR , and was quantifiable also in RS ( from 1.4 to median of 141.3 pg/mg hair). Comparing PRE- vs. POST-EXP samples , an increase in TEB level in AW and RS was found. In AW , a positive correlation between the number of PEN treatments during the season and the POST-EXP level of PEN in hair was found ( N = 8 , Spearman rho = 0.794 , p = 0.019). Our results suggest that PEN and TEB accumulate in hair during the agricultural season and that hair is a promising matrix for biomonitoring long-term exposure.
