  The diversity of tumour characteristics among glioma patients , even within same tumour grade , is a big challenge for disease outcome prediction. A possible approach for improved radiological imaging could come from combining information obtained at the molecular level. This review assembles recent evidence highlighting the value of using radiogenomic biomarkers to infer the underlying biology of gliomas and its correlation with imaging features. Methods: A literature search was done for articles published between 2002 and 2017 on Medline electronic databases. Of 249 titles identified , 38 fulfilled the inclusion criteria , with 14 articles related to quantifiable imaging parameters ( heterogeneity , vascularity , diffusion , cell density , infiltrations , perfusion , and metabolite changes) and 24 articles relevant to molecular biomarkers linked to imaging. Results: Genes found to correlate with various imaging phenotypes were EGFR , MGMT , IDH1 , VEGF , PDGF , TP53 , and Ki-67. EGFR is the most studied gene related to imaging characteristics in the studies reviewed ( 41.7 %) , followed by MGMT ( 20.8 %) and IDH1 ( 16.7 %). A summary of the relationship amongst glioma morphology , gene expressions , imaging characteristics , prognosis and therapeutic response are presented. Conclusion: The use of radiogenomics can provide insights to understanding tumour biology and the underlying molecular pathways. Certain MRI characteristics that show strong correlations with EGFR , MGMT and IDH1 could be used as imaging biomarkers. Knowing the pathways involved in tumour progression and their associated imaging patterns may assist in diagnosis , prognosis and treatment management , while facilitating personalised medicine. Advances in knowledge: Radiogenomics can offer clinicians better insight into diagnosis , prognosis , and prediction of therapeutic responses of glioma.
