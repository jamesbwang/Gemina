  In 2016 and 2017 the first three MOOCs ( Massive Online Open Course) addressing One Health were released , two of them by University of Geneva and University of Basel ( Switzerland). With the support of Swiss School of Public Health and using these two highly interdisciplinary MOOCs , the first ` Global Flipped Classroom in One Health ' was organized in Geneva and Basel in July 2017. This innovative event gathered 12 Swiss and international MOOC learners to work on specific public/global health challenges at the human-animal-ecosystem interface in interdisciplinary teams supported by experts from academia and international organisations ( e.g. World Health Organization) based in Geneva , Basel and internationally. According to the final survey , the level of satisfaction by learners was high and they benefited from the experience in different ways: reinforcement of their knowledge and capacity to perform innovative research in One Health ( e.g. using digital epidemiology) , visits and meetings with experts in Global Health ( e.g. World Health Organization and Institute of Global Health in Geneva , Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel) and emerging research collaborations etc.. A novel project-based learning and research model arising from MOOCs was successfully created , which offers opportunities for global education and research addressing real world challenges utilising a One Health approach.
