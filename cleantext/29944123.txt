  The technical lifetime of urban water infrastructure has a duration where climate change has to be considered when alterations to the system are planned. Also , models for urban water management are reaching a very high complexity level with , for example , decentralized stormwater control measures being included. These systems have to be evaluated under as close-to-real conditions as possible. Long term statistics ( LTS) modelling with observational data is the most close-to-real solution for present climate conditions , but for future climate conditions artificial rainfall time series from weather generators ( WGs) have to be used. In this study , we ran LTS simulations with four different WG products for both present and future conditions on two different catchments. For the present conditions , all WG products result in realistic catchment responses when it comes to the number of full flowing pipes and the number and volume of combined sewer overflows ( CSOs). For future conditions , the differences in the WGs representation of the expectations to climate change is evident. Nonetheless , all future results indicate that the catchments will have to handle more events that utilize the full capacity of the drainage systems. Generally , WG products are relevant to use in planning of future changes to sewer systems.
