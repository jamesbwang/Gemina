  Monitoring changes in evapotranspiration ( ET) is useful in the management of water resources in irrigated agricultural landscapes and in the assessment of crop stress and vegetation conditions of drought-vulnerable regions. Information on the impacts of climate variability on ET dynamics is profitable in developing water management adaptation strategies. Such impacts , however , are generally unreported and not conclusively determined in some regions. In this study , changes in MODIS ( Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)- derived ET ( 2000-2014) over large proportions of Sub-Sahara Africa ( SSA) are explored. The multivariate analyses of ET over SSA showed that four leading modes of observed dynamics in ET , accounting for about 90 % of the total variability , emanated mostly from some sections of the Sudano-Sahel and Congo basin. Based on Man-Kendall 's statistics , significant positive trends ( α = 0.05) in ET over the Central African Republic and most parts of the Sahel region were observed. Over much of the Congo basin nonetheless , ET showed significant ( α = 0.05) distributions of widespread negative trends. These trends in ET were rather found to be consistent with observed changes in model soil moisture but not in all locations , perhaps due to inconsistent trends in maximum rainfall and land surface temperature. However , the results of spatio-temporal drought analysis confirm that the extensive ET losses in the Congo basin were somewhat induced by soil moisture deficits. Amidst other prominent drivers of ET , the dynamics of ET over the terrestrial ecosystems of SSA appear to be a more complex phenomenon that may transcend natural climate variations.
