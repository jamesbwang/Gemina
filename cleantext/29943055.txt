  Two ligation techniques can be applied in laparoscopy for left-sided colorectal cancer: ( 1) high-tie ( HT) , transection at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery ( IMA); and ( 2) low-tie ( LT) , transection below the IMA , at the level of superior rectal artery ( SRA) , preserving the left colic artery ( LCA). However , even with preoperative images , it can still be a challenge to identify these structures due to intraoperative individual conditions. In this study , we assess the use intraoperative ultrasonography ( IOUS) to aid us in identifying the IMA and its branches to the SRA , LCA , and sigmoid artery. We performed IOUS in 18 patients diagnosed with left-sided colorectal cancer. Preoperatively , a three-dimensional computed tomography ( 3D-CT) angiography was obtained in majority of the patients , to visualize the IMA and its branches. Two patients were contraindicated to receive a contrast study , hence , was unable to undergo 3D-CT angiography. The resected specimen was grossly examined for the study. The bifurcation types were identified and compared using different modalities: preoperative 3D-CT , IOUS , and gross examination of the resected specimen. The branching of the IMA revealed by IOUS was consistent to the findings preoperatively by the 3D-CT and postoperatively by the resected specimen. The IOUS result of the two patients without preoperative 3D-CT evaluation was also consistent with the post-operative bifurcation type. IOUS is an easy and feasible modality which aids in detecting the branching of the IMA during LT and HT ligation in laparoscopic left-sided colorectal surgery. It can serve as an adjunct modality for 3D-CT angiography and can also be considered a safe alternative option for cases wherein 3D-CT angiography is unavailable.
