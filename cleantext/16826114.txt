  Considering the old age , uncertain life expectancy , co-morbidities and fear of postoperative complications , elderly patients often hesitate to undergo simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty ( SBTKA). A retrospective study of SBTKA in 46 patients ( 92 knees) of age > 70 years done between 2003 and 2012. Mean age was 80.13 Â± 5.24 years ( range -70-93 years). 74 percent had 1 or more major medical problems. There was a significant improvement of KSS at six months ( p value = 0.00). With expected benefits of surgery , SBTKA seems a safe , efficient , and viable procedure for carefully selected elderly patients.
