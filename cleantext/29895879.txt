  Systematic review and meta-analysis. To summarize the available evidence regarding the effects of trans-spinal direct current stimulation ( tsDCS) on spinal monosynaptic circuit excitability in healthy individuals. Applied Neuroscience Laboratory , Brazil. Abstract screening was performed independently by two authors for studies found in the following databases: PubMed , CINAHL , PsycINFO , Web of Science , and LILACS. If the authors were unable to agree , a third reviewer was consulted. Randomized clinical trials that reported monosynaptic reflex measures were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing the risk of bias , and information extracted about the spinal neurophysiological and stimulation protocols and their results. The initial search identified 538 studies. After applying the inclusion criteria and excluding duplicates , seven crossover studies were included in the risk of bias assessment , and six studies in the meta-analyses. The meta-analysis results did not show any significant differences between anodal ( pooled standardized mean difference ( SMD) = -0.09 , 95 % CI = -0.72 to 0.55 , p = 0.79 , I tsDCS did not affect the Hoffmann reflex , as shown in six studies. However , these findings come from studies with selection , performance and detection bias , and further research is needed to examine the effect of this intervention.
