  Although standard itraconazole pulse therapy is a well-established regimen for toenail onychomycosis , the cure rate for onychomycosis remains low. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different cycles of itraconazole pulse therapy , determine the optimal dosage and number of cycles for onychomycosis. A total of 90 outpatients of our hospital with onychomycosis were randomised into three treatment groups: ( 1) standard itraconazole pulse therapy ( 200 mg twice per day , 1 week each month for three pulses); ( 2) long-term pulse therapy ( 200 mg twice per day , 1 week each month for six pulses); ( 3) low-dose and long-term pulse therapy ( 200 mg/d , 1 week per month for six pulses) and were followed up for 15 months. Of the initial patients , the trial was completed by 81 patients. The complete cure rates were 32.43 % for three cycles and 75 % for six cycles ( P < .001). For six cycles , despite the administration of half-dose for patients weighing no more than 55 kg , there was no statistical difference in the complete cure rate ( P = .862). Long-term therapy is effective and safe for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. For patients weighing no more than 55 kg , long-term half-dose itraconazole pulse therapy is recommended.
