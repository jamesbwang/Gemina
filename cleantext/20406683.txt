  The sphingolipid ceramide is not only a precursor of more complex sphingolipids , but also a potent signaling molecule. Specific ceramide species have distinct cellular functions , and each ceramide synthase therefore has particular roles in cells and organisms. Tidhar and colleagues , utilizing two ceramide synthases differing widely in fatty acid specificity , have identified a short amino acid sequence that is critical for this specificity. This work represents a crucial first step in the understanding of both the enzymology and the biology driving the diverse functions of ceramide.
