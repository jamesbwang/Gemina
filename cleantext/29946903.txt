  Abnormal G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 ( GRK2) accumulation has a crucial role in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Although GRK2 siRNA transfection in the liver improves insulin resistance-related vascular complications , the effects of GRK2 siRNA in lipid metabolism and obesity remain unknown. To investigate how GRK2 siRNA affects obesity , ob/ob mice were transfected with GRK2 siRNA , mainly in the liver , by using a hydrodynamic-based procedure. Epididymal fat , glucose , triglyceride , non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFA) , and alanine transaminase activity were higher in the control siRNA-transfected ob/ob mice than in the control siRNA-transfected Lean mice , but these parameters were reduced by GRK2 siRNA transfection into the ob/ob mice. GRK2 expression in epididymal fat was not altered among the 3 groups , although hepatic GRK2 expression was higher in the control siRNA-transfected ob/ob mice than in the control siRNA-transfected Lean mice. Additionally , we found that Akt interacted with GRK2 in the liver. Furthermore , phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and JNK were higher in the epididymal fats from the control siRNA-transfected ob/ob mice than in those from the control siRNA-transfected Lean mice , but they were lowered by transfection with GRK2 siRNA. The study results showed that GRK2 siRNA improved blood triglyceride levels and abnormal or excessive activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases in epididymal fat. This effect may be promoted by inhibition of the NEFA production pathway in the liver. Therefore , the interaction of organs ( hepatic GRK2-epididymal fat) may help improve insulin resistance and diabetes-associated pathophysiology.
