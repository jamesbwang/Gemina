  Metasurfaces consisting of a two-dimensional metallic nano-antenna array are capable of transferring a Gaussian beam into an optical vortex with a helical phase front and a phase singularity by manipulating the polarization/phase status of light. This miniaturizes a laboratory scaled optical system into a wafer scale component , opening up a new area for broad applications in optics. However , the low conversion efficiency to generate a vortex beam from circularly polarized light hinders further development. This paper reports our recent success in improving the efficiency over a broad waveband at the visible frequency compared with the existing work. The choice of material , the geometry and the spatial organization of meta-atoms , and the fabrication fidelity are theoretically investigated by the Jones matrix method. The theoretical conversion efficiency over 40 % in the visible wavelength range is worked out by systematic calculation using the finite difference time domain ( FDTD) method. The fabricated metasurface based on the parameters by theoretical optimization demonstrates a high quality vortex in optical frequencies with a significantly enhanced efficiency of over 20 % in a broad waveband.
