  We estimate the impact of international child sponsorship on adult income and wealth of formerly sponsored children using data on 10,144 individuals in six countries. To identify causal effects , we utilize an age-eligibility rule followed from 1980 to 1992 that limited sponsorship to children 12 years old or younger when the program was introduced in a village , allowing comparisons of sponsored children with older siblings who were slightly too old to be sponsored. Estimations indicate that international child sponsorship increased monthly income by $ 13-17 over an untreated baseline of $ 75 , principally from inducing higher future labor market participation. We find evidence for positive impacts on dwelling quality in adulthood , and modest evidence of impacts on ownership of consumer durables in adulthood , limited to increased ownership of mobile phones. Finally , our results also show modest effects of child sponsorship on childbearing in adulthood.
