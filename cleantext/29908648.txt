  To investigate the impact of maternal stress during pregnancy on newborn iron and stage 1 iron deficiency at 1 year of age. In total , 245 mothers and their newborn infants ( 52 % male; 72 % white) were recruited at the Meriter Hospital Birthing Center on the basis of known risk factors for iron deficiency. Umbilical cord blood hemoglobin and zinc protoporphyrin/heme ( ZnPP/H) were determined to evaluate erythrocyte iron and plasma ferritin was determined to reflect storage iron. Mothers retrospectively reported stress experienced previously during pregnancy on a 25-item questionnaire. Blood was also was collected from 79 infants who were breastfed at 1 year of age. Maternal recall of distress and health concerns during pregnancy correlated with cord blood ZnPP/H indices ( r = 0.21 , P < .01) , even in the absence of major traumatic events. When concurrent with other known risks for iron deficiency , including maternal adiposity , socioeconomic status , and race , maternal stress had a summative effect , lowering cord blood iron. At 1 year , 24 % of infants who were breastfed had moderate iron deficiency ( plasma ferritin < 12 Âµg/L). Higher cord blood ZnPP/H was predictive of this moderate iron deficiency ( 95 % CI 0.26-1.47 , P = .007). When coincident with maternal reports of gestational stress , the likelihood of low plasma ferritin at 1 year increased 36-fold in breastfed infants as compared with low-stress pregnancies ( 95 % CI 1.33-6.83 , P = .007). Maternal recall of stress during pregnancy was associated with lower iron stores at birth. High cord blood ZnPP/H , reflecting low erythrocyte iron , was correlated with the likelihood of stage 1 iron deficiency at 1 year , when rapid growth can deplete storage iron in breastfed infants.
