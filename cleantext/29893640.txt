  Access to inclusive , equitable health care is central to the wellbeing of all college students yet little is known about LGBTQ students ' experiences with university health services. In this article , individual interviews with a convenience sample of 14 LGBTQ students at a large public university were analyzed to explore their perceptions of and experiences with the university 's health center and its services. Our findings demonstrate that the university is not adequately meeting their health care needs. Participants ' narratives offer insights into how to improve campus-based health services for LGBTQ students.
