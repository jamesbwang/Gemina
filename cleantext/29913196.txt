  PhTx2 is the most toxic fraction from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer , being responsible to sodium entry into cortical synaptosomes , increasing the release of neurotransmitters , such as l-glutamate ( L-Glu) and; acetylcholine. In this study , we investigated the action of a toxin purified from; PhTx2 fraction , called PnTx2-6 or δ-CNTX-Pn2a , on L-Glu release from rat; brain cortex synaptosomes , as well as its ability to induce blood-brain barrier permeability. PnTx2-6 increased L-Glu release from rat cortical brain synaptosomes in a time- and dose-dependent manner ( EC50 = ∼ 20 nM; Tm = 16 min) , as measured by a fluorimetric method. The increase of L-Glu by PnTx2-6 was inhibited by tetrodotoxin. And partially inhibited by EGTA. Calcium channel blockers ω-conotoxin MVIIC ( P/Q-types) and ω-conotoxin GVIA ( N-type) , were able to reduce the PnTx2-6-induced release of L-Glu , while nifedipine ( L-type) did not show any inhibition. These findings suggest that thew release of L-Glu by PnTx2-6 is due its primary action on sodium channels , well-known to be target of this toxin. PnTx2-6 is able to potentiate penile erection and this effect may be related with the release of l-glutamate from the CNS , besides a local effect on corpus carvenosum , as previously shown by our group. If L-Glu release and penile erection potentiation are indeed correlated , then this toxin should be able to cross the blood brain barrier ( BBB). Results by immunoblotting assays indicated a change in the expression of proteins associated with the paracellular and transcellular transport at the blood-brain barrier , suggesting a BBB dysfunction mediated by PnTx2-6. Therefore , PnTx2-6 may induce the release l-glutamate in the central nervous system , when injected peripherally.
