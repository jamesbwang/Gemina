  Zhejiang introduced universal salt iodization ( USI) programme in 1995 and has achieved the goal of elimination of iodine deficiency disorders ( IDD) since 2011. However , no systematical data of iodine nutritional status in population in pregnancy is available. In this cross-sectional study , pregnant women were interviewed to complete questionnaires in addition to handing in samples of urine and household table salt between March 2016 to February 2017. Date of birth , age of pregnancy , ethnicity and dietary iodine habits were recorded. The overall median urinary iodine concentration in 8561 pregnant women was 130.47 µg/L , which was lower than the cut-off value of iodine sufficiency of 150 µg/L recommended by the WHO. Participants using non-iodized salt , taking non-iodine-containing supplements , in coastal and in Han group were independently associated with iodine deficiency. The current USI programme did not supply Zhejiang pregnant women with sufficient iodine intake. They are generally iodine deficient , which have great public health importance since even mild IDD in pregnancy have adverse effects on fetal neurodevelopment. We strongly recommend urgent measures to improve iodine intake in pregnancy.
