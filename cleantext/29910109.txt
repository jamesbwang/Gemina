  There have been significant advances in the field of oncology leading to improved survival as a result of novel targeted and immunotherapies. Despite these improved outcomes , there is increased recognition of cardiotoxicities associated with these therapies that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. As such , the field of cardio-oncology has seen significant growth over the last several years. In this review , we discuss recent advances in the field of cardio-oncology and provide a detailed discussion of the cardiovascular complications associated with novel cancer therapeutics including tyrosine kinase inhibitors , proteasome inhibitors , histone deacetylase inhibitors , CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies.
