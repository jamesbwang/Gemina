  The optimal management of patients with multivessel coronary artery disease ( MVD) admitted with STEMI is under debate. CABG is rarely performed , even on ideal candidates. A provisional PCI without stent implantation may allow complete surgical revascularization ( CSR) in a subset of patient that we sought to identify in this study. Patients with STEMI from April 2014 to October 2016 were evaluated and those with a TIMI flow < 3 in the culprit vessel , and an additional stenosis of > 70 % in an epicardial vessel or sidebranch > 2.5 mm were selected. Epidemiological variables , surgical risk scores and SYNTAX and SYNTAX II scores were analyzed. All the selected patients were discussed in a post hoc heart-team , and predictors of 12-month events were also analyzed. Seventy-two ( 19.0 %) accomplished MVD criteria. Mean SYNTAX was 19 Â± 13 points and SYNTAX II score recommended CABG in 12 patients ( 16.7 %) and heart-team discussion in 60 ( 83.3 %). All patients were discussed in a post hoc heart-team , which concluded that 21 ( 29.2 %) patients could have been good candidates for CSR. After one year follow-up , SYNTAX II PCI > 40 was found to be the sole independent predictor for 12-month events ( OR 12.9 ( 2.7-62.1) , p = 0.001). MVD and STEMI with a SYNTAX II PCI > 40 should be discussed in an ad-hoc heart team , after a provisional revascularization of the culprit vessel , and should be considered for CSR , especially when the RCA is the culprit artery and there is a complex<disease> disease<disease> in the left coronary artery.
