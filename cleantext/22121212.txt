  Identifying similarities between datasets is a fundamental task in data mining and has become an integral part of modern scientific investigation. Whether the task is to identify co-expressed genes in large-scale expression surveys or to predict combinations of gene knockouts which would elicit a similar phenotype , the underlying computational task is often a multi-dimensional similarity test. As datasets continue to grow , improvements to the efficiency , sensitivity or specificity of such computation will have broad impacts as it allows scientists to more completely explore the wealth of scientific data. The Blazing Signature Filter ( BSF) is a highly efficient pairwise similarity algorithm which enables extensive data mining within a reasonable amount of time. The algorithm transforms datasets into binary metrics , allowing it to utilize the computationally efficient bit operators and provide a coarse measure of similarity. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm using two common bioinformatics tasks: identifying data sets with similar gene expression profiles , and comparing annotated genomes. The BSF is a highly efficient pairwise similarity algorithm that can scale to billions of comparisons without the need for specialized hardware.
