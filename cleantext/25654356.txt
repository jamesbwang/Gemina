  Chlamydia<pathogen> is a major bacterial pathogen in humans and animals globally. Yet 80 % of infections never progress to clinical disease. Decades of research have generated an interconnected network linking pathogen , host , and environmental factors to disease expression , but the relative importance of these and whether they account for disease progression remains unknown. To address this , we used structural equation modeling to evaluate putative factors likely to contribute to urogenital and ocular chlamydial disease in the koala ( Phascolarctos cinereus<pathogen>). These factors include Chlamydia<pathogen> detection , load , and ompA genotype; urogenital and ocular microbiomes; host sex , age , weight , body condition; breading season , time of year; location; retrovirus co-infection; and major histocompatibility complex class II ( MHCII) alleles. We show different microbiological processes underpin disease progression at urogenital and ocular sites. From each category of factors , urogenital disease was most strongly predicted by chlamydial PCR detection and load , koala body condition and environmental location. In contrast , ocular disease was most strongly predicted by phylum-level Chlamydiae microbiome proportions , sampling during breeding season and co-infection with koala retrovirus subtype B. Host MHCII alleles also contributed predictive power to both disease models. Our results also show considerable uncertainty remains , suggesting major causal mechanisms are yet to be discovered.
