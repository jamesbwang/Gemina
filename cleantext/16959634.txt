  By definition , mating between individuals is infrequent in highly selfing organisms , and so too , therefore , hybridization should be rare between genetically divergent lineages in predominantly self-fertilizing species. Notwithstanding these expectations , here we report a remarkable case of natural hybridization between highly diverged phylogeographic lineages of the mangrove rivulus , a small killifish that reproduces predominantly by self-fertilization and typically is found as highly homozygous lines in most parts of its extensive geographical range. Two distinctive genetic lineages (
