  Regular handrim wheelchair ( RHW) propulsion is straining for the upper extremities and wheelchair users often experience overuse problems. A recent advancement in wheelchair technology that could assist users is the pushrim-activated power-assisted wheelchair ( PAPAW). PAPAWs are challenging to control , yet it is unclear how people learn to use a PAPAW. The purpose of this study is to examine early skill acquisition through practice in PAPAWs and compare it with RHWs. Twenty-four able-bodied novices were randomly allocated to either the RHW group or the PAPAW group. The experiment consisted of five sessions with three blocks of 4 min steady-state practice at 1.11 m/s and 0.21 W/kg. Finally , a transfer to the other mode was made. Data were collected with a drag-test , breath-by-breath spirometry , and a motion capture system. The last minute of each four-minute block was used for analysis. A mixed analysis of variance ( ANOVA) was used to test for group , time , and interaction effects. Both groups improved their ( assisted) mechanical efficiency , reduced their stroke rate , right-left and forward-backward deviation on the treadmill , and had a lower rate of perceived exertion ( RPE) over time. ( Assisted) mechanical efficiency was higher for the PAPAW group than for the RHW group and RPE was lower. However , left-right and forward-backward deviation was also found to be higher in the PAPAW group. At the group level the energetic cost of RHW and PAPAW propulsion can be lowered through low-intensity practice in novice users. The PAPAW is more ` efficient ' than the RHW given the reduced energy requirement of the user from the motor assist , but more difficult to control. Future studies on PAPAWs should focus on the control needs of the user and their interaction with the power-assist technology.
