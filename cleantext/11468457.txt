  As emergency physicians , we encounter patients suffering from either hypoxemic and/or hypercarbic respiratory problems on a daily basis. A stepwise approach to solving this problem seems logical from an emergency medicine perspective. Current literature supports the notion that NIV decreases endotracheal intubation rates and , mortality in select patient populations. The key to the success of NIV is patient cooperation and support for the care givers. In this narrative review , non-invasive ventilation ( NIV) is discussed in terms of modes of delivery , interface and patient selection , as well as practical considerations.
