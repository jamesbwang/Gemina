  Stem cell research has become a frontier in the field of life sciences , and provides an ideal model for exploring developmental biology problems such as embryogenesis , histiocytosis , and gene expression regulation , as well as opens up new doors for clinical tissue defective and inheritance diseases. Among them , menstrual blood-derived stem cells ( MenSCs) are characterized by wide source , multi-directional differentiation potential , low immune rejection characteristics. Thus , MenSCs can achieve individual treatment and have the most advantage of the clinical application. The central nervous system , including brain and spinal cord , is susceptible to injury. And lethality and morbidity of them tops the list of all types of trauma. Compared to peripheral nervous system , recovery of central nervous system after damage remains extremely hard. However , the treatment of stem cells , especially MenSCs , is expected to solve this problem. Therefore , biological characteristics of MenSCs and their treatment in the respect of central nervous system diseases have been reviewed at home and abroad in recent years , so as to provide reference for the treatment of central nervous system diseases.
