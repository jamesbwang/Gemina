  Insufficient hip neuromuscular control may contribute to non-contact sport injuries. However , the current evaluative test of hip neuromuscular control , the single-leg squat , requires hip abductor muscle strength to complete. The purpose of this study was to develop the hip control test ( HCT) and determine the test 's reliability and construct validity. Nineteen healthy adults visited the laboratory twice. The HCT is a 10-s test of reciprocal toe-tapping accuracy. Both automated and manual HCT ratings were recorded simultaneously during each visit. Additionally , eccentric hip abductor torque was measured. HCT reliability was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients ( ICC). Agreement between automated and manual ratings was determined with Bland-Altman plots. Construct validity was established if HCT performance significantly decreased with a secondary cognitive task ( p < 0.05). Bivariate regression determined the relationship between HCT performance and eccentric hip abductor torque. Automated and manual HCT ratings both had moderate reliability ( ICC = 0.72) and yielded similar results ( limits of agreement = -1 to 2 taps). The HCT had construct validity ( p = 0.001) , and no correlation with hip abductor muscle strength ( r = 0.213). Thus , the HCT is a reliable and valid test. The HCT is simple to administer and measures hip neuromuscular control separately from strength.
