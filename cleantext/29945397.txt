  `` Jinchai Shihu '' were called Jinchai and recoded in `` Taishang Zhouhou Yujingfang '' of Tang Dynasty , which first clearly documented the name of Shihu in complex Dendrobium medicines and were condiered as superior medicinal articles. Morphological features are one of the naming principles for Chinese medicines. In this paper , botanical origin plants under the names of `` Jinchai '' and `` Jinchai Shihu '' were investigated. Based on documents from the local Chronicles and historical accounts , the Chinese characters of Jinchai have the distinctive features of gold color and two hair clasps. Moreover , the hair clasps are usually cylindrical in shape with uniform thickness in middle and upper part , and tapers off to the foot. And its bottom part style is simple and head part is complex. Thus we speculated the herbal `` Jinchai '' and `` Jinchai Shihu '' should have similar morphologic features as Chinese characters of Jinchai , including golden color and hairpin shape of stems without braches , short and solid sterm. After comparing the dried vegetative morphology of 10 common medicinal Dendrobium species , we suggested that of Dendrobium flexicaule matches well with the morphological features from historical herbal records.
