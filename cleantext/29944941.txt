  In the present study , polysaccharides from chickpea hull ( CHPS) were incorporated into carboxymethyl cellulose ( CMC) for the development of CMC-based films. The physical and mechanical properties , color , transmittance , antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were investigated , and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) , Fourier transform-infrared ( FT-IR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA) were applied to study the potential interaction , structure and thermal stabilization of the prepared films. The results revealed that some physical and mechanical properties of films , like moisture content , elongation at break and water vapor permeability , were decreased. While thickness , swelling ratio , water solubility and tensile strength were significantly increased ( p < 0.05) compared with control film. Furthermore , the films exhibited potential antioxidant effects on DPPH and ABTS free radicals. The results of scanning electron microscopy showed rough and heterogeneous morphology for CMC-CHPS films while control film exhibited smooth , homogenous and compact structure. FT-IR results reflected good interaction of chemical groups and bonds between CMC and CHPS. DSC results showed that glass transition temperature increased significantly ( p < 0.05) from 82.68 to 90.39 °C compared with control of 78.21 °C. Thermal stability of all films was improved , indicating that the films could be used as biocomposite materials for packaging of food products.
