  Better means to control placebo effects are key to optimizing treatment outcomes. Dopamine-based reward and learning mechanisms have been hypothesized to drive placebo effects. Here , we tested whether dopamine augmentation can modulate learned placebo effects. We performed a randomized , double-blind parallel group study with 70 healthy adult participants to test whether a single oral dose of the dopamine precursor levodopa/carbidopa ( 100/25 mg) administered before the acquisition of conditioned placebo analgesia enhances the placebo response in an established experimental placebo model using heat pain. Overall , the observed levels of placebo analgesia in our sample were low and not statistically significant. Levodopa , compared to placebo , only led to a marginal increase in placebo analgesia. Female participants tended to show larger placebo responses than male participants. Within the female subgroup , levodopa showed small-to-moderate effects on placebo analgesia; however , this effect was not statistically significant. In summary , the present study could not provide evidence for a placebo augmenting effect of levodopa-enhanced dopamine levels in healthy subjects. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether placebo enhancement can be achieved through dopamine augmentation.
