  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is among the most common cancers and accounts as the second leading cause of death from cancers in the world. RAD51 plays a crucial role in double-strand breaks repair of DNA. Single nucleotide polymorphisms within this gene could influence on the potential of DNA repair and in consequence on the susceptibility to various tumors such as CRC. This is the first report about the role of RAD51 polymorphisms in Iranian CRC susceptibility. The study was conducted to evaluate the association of 135G > C polymorphism of RAD51 gene with sporadic CRC in a subset of Iranian population. The current case-control study was performed from 2013 to 2015. One hundred patients with sporadic CRC and one hundred controls were enrolled from two referral centers in Isfahan. All samples were genotyped for the RAD51 gene using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The results revealed no significant association between the RAD51 135G > C and sporadic CRC ( odds ratio = 0.86 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.464-1.595). The frequency of genotypes and also alleles of the mentioned polymorphism were not significantly different between case and control groups ( P = 0.2 and 0.4 , respectively). The results suggest that RAD51 135G > C probably has not a crucial role in Iranian CRC risk and is not an important potential risk factor in molecular diagnostics of mentioned disease among Iranian population.
