  We evaluated the relationship between new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI) or serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI) drug use and respiratory-related morbidity and mortality among older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). This was a retrospective population-based cohort study using heath administrative data from Ontario , Canada. Individuals aged â‰¥ 66 years , with validated , physician-diagnosed COPD ( n = 131718) were included. New SSRI/SNRI users were propensity score matched 1:1 to controls on 40 relevant covariates to minimise potential confounding.Among propensity score matched community-dwelling individuals , new SSRI/SNRI users compared to non-users had significantly higher rates of hospitalisation for COPD or pneumonia<disease> ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.15 , 95 % CI 1.05-1.25) , emergency room visits for COPD or pneumonia<disease> ( HR 1.13 , 95 % CI 1.03-1.24) , COPD or pneumonia-related mortality ( HR 1.26 , 95 % CI 1.03-1.55) and all-cause mortality ( HR 1.20 , 95 % CI 1.11-1.29). In addition , respiratory-specific and all-cause mortality rates were higher among long-term care home residents newly starting SSRI/SNRI drugs
