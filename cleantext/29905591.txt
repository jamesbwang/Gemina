  Despite demonstrated efficacy , the utilization of herpes<disease> zoster<disease> vaccine ( HZV) , recommended by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC) for all immunocompetent adults aged above 60 years , is low ( 31 %). The aim of this study was to identify nurse practitioner ( NP) barriers to HZV administration and then to use these results to develop and evaluate the outcomes of an educational program. This study used a two-phase design. In Phase I , barriers that obstruct the provision of HZV were identified and NPs were surveyed to determine current HZV practice. The second phase used a quasiexperimental pretest-posttest design to evaluate the impact of the constructed program. In Phase I , NYS Primary Care NPs with practice years ranging from 1 to 24 , who reported working in practice sites that ranged from 1 to 20 providers , possessed limited knowledge of the vaccine , especially , the financial aspects of the vaccination such as up-front cost ( 46 %) , cost to patients ( 39 %) , and reimbursement ( 29 %) , resulting in fewer provider recommendations. In Phase II , a paired-samples t test revealed a statistically significant difference between pretest scores ( mean = 3.4 , SD = 1.2) and posttest scores ( mean = 4.7 , SD = 1.3) on the knowledge survey , t ( 37) = -7.1 , p < .0 , demonstrating NPs ' improved understanding of HZV. Nurse practitioners will increase compliance with the CDC recommendations for HZV administration.
