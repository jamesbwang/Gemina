  The aim of the study was to evaluate the cognitive functioning of children and youth with type 1 diabetes ( T1DM). The study included 68 children with type 1 diabetes , aged 6-17 years , divided into 3 groups according to the level of glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c): group 1: HbA1c â‰¤ 6.0-7.5 %; group 2: HbA1c 7.6-8.5 %; group 3: HbA1c over 8.6 %. Wechsler 's intelligence scale ( WISC-R) , the Trail of 10 words and Brickenkamp 's and Zillmer 's d2 Test of Attention were used to assess cognitive functioning. The research demonstrated a significant influence of low , medium or high glycaemic control on lowering the general level of functioning in verbal intelligence , and in WISC-R subtests: information , vocabulary , comprehension , number sequencing and block design. Children with type 1 diabetes mellitus can experience difficulties in cognitive functioning , as a consequence of high HbA1c. Additional research , involving a larger group of patients and a wider age range when the disease was diagnosed , will enable further findings on the occurrence of cognitive impairment in T1DM.
