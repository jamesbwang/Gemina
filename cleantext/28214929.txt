  Myeloid immune cells , such as dendritic cells , monocytes , and macrophages , play a central role in the generation of immune responses and thus are often either disabled or even hijacked by tumors. These new tolerogenic activities of tumor-associated myeloid cells are controlled by an oncogenic transcription factor , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3). STAT3 multitasks to ensure tumors escape immune detection by impairing antigen presentation and reducing production of immunostimulatory molecules while augmenting the release of tolerogenic mediators , thereby reducing innate and adaptive antitumor immunity. Tumor-associated myeloid cells and STAT3 signaling in this compartment are now commonly recognized as an attractive cellular target for improving efficacy of standard therapies and immunotherapies. Hereby , we review the importance and functional complexity of STAT3 signaling in this immune cell compartment as well as potential strategies for cancer therapy.
