  The purpose of this study was to describe the variability and test-retest reliability of a commercially available subjective visual vertical ( SVV) system known as Virtual SVV ( Interacoustics). In addition , the study aimed to compare the reliability of the Virtual system with a previously established bucket test of SVV. Fifteen participants with normal hearing , normal middle ear function , and normal utricular function were included in the study. Each participant underwent static SVV testing using both the Virtual system and the bucket test. Subjects completed 2 testing sessions to determine test-retest reliability. For each test , data were collected with the head at 0 ° , tilted 45 ° to the right , and tilted 45 ° to the left. This study was conducted in a balance<symptom> function laboratory embedded in a large , tertiary care otology clinic. The mean SVV values obtained with the Virtual system were within 1 ° -2 ° from 0 with the head positioned at 0 ° , which is in agreement with many other studies of SVV with the head at 0 ° ( Akin & Murnane , 2009; Halmagyi & Curthoys , 1999; Zwergal , Rettinger , Frenzel , Dieterich , & Strupp , 2009). Using the intraclass correlation coefficient , test-retest reliability of the Virtual system was excellent in the 45 ° left position and fair to good in the 45 ° right and 0 ° position. Test-retest reliability of the bucket test was poor in all head positions. The Virtual system is a more reliable measure of static SVV than the bucket test. Therefore , the Virtual system could be utilized as a screening device for utricular dysfunction in busy clinical settings.
