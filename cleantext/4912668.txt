  Brucellosis<disease> is a zoonotic disease of public health importance; its prevalence varies globally. In low-income countries , brucellosis<disease> is an endemic and neglected disease affecting both animals and humans. This study was intended to establish brucellosis<disease> sero-prevalence among patients attending Wau hospital , South Sudan. Across sectional study , was done among randomly selected patients attending Wau hospital. Data was collected using questionnaires and laboratory investigations. Rose Bengal plate Test ( RBPT) , Serum agglutination test ( SAT) and Competitive Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay ( c-ELISA) was used in the analysis of blood samples serially starting with RBPT which is more sensitive and least specific then SAT. c-ELISA test which is most specific and less sensitive compared to RBPT and SAT was then used to confirm presence of Brucella antibodies in the samples. A total of 416 participants out of 1664 were enrolled to this study. The majority of participants were between 7-to-76 years of age with mean age of 30.72 ( SD +/- 12.83). The sero-positivity of patient 's blood samples for brucellosis<disease> using c-ELISA was 23.3 % ( 97/416) among patients presenting to Wau hospital. Socio-demographic characteristics , occupation , clinical signs of disease and types of animals reared by animal owners showed no significant correlation with occurrence of sero-positivity among patient 's blood samples for brucellosis<disease> While ethnicity ( Nilotic) , knowledge of zoonotic disease , and consumption of animal urine were statistically significant ( p < 0.05). The study found a high prevalence of brucellosis<disease> among febrile patients attending Wau hospital general outpatient clinic. There is need for co-ordination and collaboration between veterinary and health sectors of government to help prevent and control brucellosis<disease> in the region.
