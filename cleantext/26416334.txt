  Few studies have investigated the dry needling ( DN) approach on knee osteoarthritis ( KO) patients. The study 's aim was to evaluate the short-term efficacy of adding DN to a therapeutic exercise protocol in the treatment of KO in older adults. A double-blind , pilot clinical trial with parallel groups ( NCT02698072) was carried out for 12 weeks of treatment and follow-up. Twenty patients aged 65 years and older with myofascial trigger points ( MTrPs) in the muscles of the thigh were recruited from older-adult care centers and randomly assigned to a DN + Exercise group or a Sham-DN + Exercise group. The Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS; primary outcome) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire ( WOMAC) were assessed before and after the intervention. The NRS ( analysis of variance , ANOVA) showed statistically significant differences in the time factor ( F = 53.038; P < .0001; ηp = 0.747). However , it did not show a significant change in the group-time interaction ( F = 0.082; P = .777; ηp = 0.005). The WOMAC scores ( ANOVA) showed statistically significant differences in the time factor for total score WOMAC questionnaire ( F = 84.826; P < .0001; ηp = 0.825) , WOMAC pain ( F = 90.478; P < .0001; ηp = 0.834) , WOMAC stiffness ( F = 14.556; P < .001; ηp = 0.447) , and WOMAC function ( F = 70.872; P < .0001; ηp = 0.797). However , it did not show a statistically significant change in the group-time interaction. Despite the pain intensity and disability clinically relevant improvement for both DN and Sham-DN combined with exercise , 6 sessions of DN added to a therapeutic exercise program for older adults with KO did not seem to improve pain intensity and functionality.
