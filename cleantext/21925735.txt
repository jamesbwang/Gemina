  Streptococcal bacteria are among dangerous human pathogens with major prevalence worldwide. A good vaccine against streptococcal bacteria should have epitopes that confer protection from infection by different streptococcal bacteria types. we aimed was to recognize the most immunogenic and conserved epitopes of streptococcal bacteria , which could be a potential candidate for vaccine development. Nineteen different M proteins of different streptococcal bacteria were chosen and analyzed. Nine-mer epitopes able to simulate both cells mediate and humoral immunity were predicted. Molecular docking was applied in order to measure free binding energy of selected epitopes. Final epitopes were analyzed if they were conserved among different streptococcal bacteria. The identified epitopes require experimental validation for their potential use in peptide vaccines.
