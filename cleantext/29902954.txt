  Ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> ( VAP) might be increased in cases with intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH). However , despite animal experimentation and physiological studies on humans in favor of this hypothesis , there is no definitive clinical data that IAH is associated with VAP. We therefore aimed to study whether IAH is a risk factor for increased incidence of VAP in critical care patients. This 1-center prospective observational cohort study was conducted in the intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Larissa , Greece , during 2013 to 2015. Consecutive patients were recruited if they presented risk factors for IAH at admission and were evaluated systematically for IAH and VAP for a 28-day period. Forty-five ( 36.6 %) of 123 patients presented IAH and 45 ( 36.6 %) presented VAP; 24 patients presented VAP following IAH. Cox regression analysis showed that VAP was independently associated with IAH ( 1.06 ( 1.01-1.11); P = .053) , while there was an indication for an independent association between VAP and abdominal surgery ( 1.62 ( 0.87-3.03); P = .11) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( 1.79 ( 0.96-3.37); P = .06). Intra-abdominal hypertension is an independent risk factor for increased VAP incidence in critically ill patients who present risk factors for IAH at admission to the ICU.
