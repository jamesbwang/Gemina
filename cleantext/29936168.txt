  Inconsistencies are noted regarding the association between cadmium exposure and blood pressure/hypertension and the interaction between cadmium and body mass index ( BMI). This study aims to clarify these inconsistencies in a large sample ( n = 32,791) of adults age â‰¥ 20 years from eight cycles of the US National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey ( NHANES , 1999-2014). The cadmium levels in blood ( BCd) and urine ( UCd) were used as exposure biomarker. Multiple-linear/logistic regression models were built and stratified by sex , ethnicity and BMI category. The interaction between BCd and BMI was assessed on additive and multiplicative scales. A twofold increase in BCd was associated with 0.54 mm Hg ( 95 % CI: 0.49 , 0.58) and 0.05 mm Hg ( 95 % CI: 0.04 , 0.06) increases in the systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP) , respectively , in black women. The SBP and DBP increased by 0.92 mm Hg ( 95 % CI: 0.73 , 1.11) and 0.85 mm Hg ( 95 % CI: 0.65 , 1.05) , respectively , in Mexican-Am women. Significant associations were found between BCd and hypertension in them ( systolic risk per twofold BCd , OR = 1.31; 95 % CI: 1.07 , 1.61; and diastolic risk per twofold BCd , OR = 1.55; 95 % CI: 1.17 , 2.05). UCd was significantly associated with hypertension in all individuals ( OR = 1.14 per twofold; 95 % CI: 1.07 , 1.21). The associations between cadmium exposure and blood pressure/hypertension showed some discrepancies across BMI categories. A negative interaction was observed between BCd and obesity with regard to their effects on systolic hypertension ( RERI = -0.30; 95 % CI: -0.56 , -0.03; ratio of ORs = 0.55; 95 % CI: 0.35 , 0.89). Our findings provided evidence for the effect of cadmium on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and the prevalence of hypertension in American adults. The associations showed discrepancies by sex and ethnicity. The negative interaction between cadmium exposure and obesity influenced systolic hypertension risk.
