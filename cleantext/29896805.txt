  To examine how expertise redundancy and transactive memory ( TM) in interdisciplinary care teams ( ICTs) are related to team performance. Survey and administrative data were collected from 26 interdisciplinary mental health teams. The study used a longitudinal , observational design. Independent variables were measured at baseline , 6 , and 12 months: expertise redundancy ( the extent to which team members possess highly overlapping knowledge) , TM accuracy ( the extent to which team members accurately recognize experts in relevant knowledge domains) , and TM consensus ( the extent to which team members agree on who is expert in which knowledge domain). Team performance was measured as risk-adjusted average number of client hospitalization for the 6 months following each survey. Survey data were collected by the authors. Administrative data were collected by the state 's administrative agency. Expertise redundancy had a negative effect on performance. TM accuracy had a positive effect on performance , and such effect was stronger when expertise redundancy was higher. No significant effect was found on TM consensus. Transactive memory could serve as a cognitive coordination mechanism for mitigating the negative effect of complex knowledge structure in ICTs.
