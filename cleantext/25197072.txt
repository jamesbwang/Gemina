  Lithography , the transfer of patterns to a film or substrate , is the basis by which many modern technological devices and components are produced. However , established lithographic approaches generally use complex techniques , expensive equipment , and advanced materials. Here , we introduce a water-based microcontact printing method using silk that is simple , inexpensive , ecofriendly , and recyclable. Whereas the traditional microcontact printing technique facilitates only negative lithography , the synergetic interaction of the silk , water , and common chemicals in our technique enables both positive and negative patterning using a single stamp. Among diverse application possibilities , we exemplify a proof of concept of the method through optimizing its metal lift-off process and demonstrate the fabrication of electromagnetic metamaterial elements on both solid and flexible substrates. The results indicate that the method demonstrated herein is universally applicable to device production and technology development.
