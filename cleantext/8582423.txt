  We report on a boy of Albanian descent with the history of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia<disease> ( JMML). JMML was diagnosed at the age of 17 months and treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT). At the age of 14.3 years , about 12 years after HSCT , he was hospitalized with an adrenal crisis. Hormone findings were consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency. Autoimmune adrenalitis was confirmed by positive autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase and adrenal tissue. Since autoimmune Hashimoto thyroiditis was already known from the age of 9 years , we assume that both diseases are part of the spectrum of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome<disease> ( APS) type 2. APS type 2 is a rare endocrine disease characterized by Addison 's disease along with autoimmune thyroid disease and/or type 1 diabetes. Endocrine sequelae after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) are common and can develop over a long period.Primary adrenal insufficiency after HSCT is absolutely rare.The combination of adrenal autoimmune disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis is consistent with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome<disease> type 2.
