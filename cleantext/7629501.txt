  Dendritic cells ( DCs) are important to the immune system and are frequently recruited to hypoxic regions , especially during acute myocardial infarction ( AMI). Emerging data indicate that histone deacetylase ( HDAC) inhibitors possess immunomodulatory functions. We previously showed in a rat model of AMI that the HDAC inhibitor TSA improved tissue repair , and this was accompanied by increased DC infiltration in the infarct region , suggesting an important role of TSA in modulating DC functions. To study the potential modulatory effect of TSA on DCs , we exploited an
