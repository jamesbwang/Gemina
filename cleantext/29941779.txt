  The aim of this study was to investigate if a developmental enamel defect known as Molar-Incisor Hypomineralization ( MIH) is associated with dental<disease> caries<disease> Socioeconomic status ( SES) was examined as a confounding factor between caries<disease> and MIH. In this cross-sectional study , 636 children , aged 8 to 13 years , from three towns ( two rural areas and one urban area) in Finland were examined for MIH in line with the criteria of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry. Caries<disease> status for permanent teeth was recorded as decayed , missing and filled teeth ( DMFT). Caries<disease> experience ( DMFT > 0) in the first permanent molars ( FPMs) was set as an outcome. SES was determined using a questionnaire completed by parents. The prevalence of MIH was 18.1 %. The mean DMFT in FPMs for children with MIH was higher than for their peers , 1.03 ± 1.25 vs. 0.32 ± 0.80 (
