  Prostate cancer ( PCa) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. While genomic alterations have been identified in PCa , in contrast to some other cancers , use of such information to personalize treatment is still in its infancy. Here , we discuss how PAGE4 , a protein which appears to act both as an oncogenic factor as well as a metastasis suppressor , is a novel therapeutic target for PCa. Inhibiting PAGE4 may be a viable strategy for low-risk PCa where it is highly upregulated. Conversely , PAGE4 expression is downregulated in metastatic PCa and , therefore , reinstituting its sustained expression may be a promising option to subvert or attenuate androgen-resistant PCa. Thus , fine-tuning the levels of PAGE4 may represent a novel approach for personalized medicine in PCa.
