  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) on immunosuppression are at risk of developing lymphoma , particularly primary gastrointestinal ( GI) tract non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Primary GI Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL) in this setting , however , is rare and poorly defined. Here we review the available literature and also report a patient with Crohn 's disease ( CD) who developed GI HL. Our search yielded 12 single case studies and 7 case series involving 22 patients published between 1978-2016. Twenty-one ( 91 %) patients had CD , and 2 had ulcerative colitis<disease>. The median age at lymphoma diagnosis was 39 years , and 18 ( 78 %) patients were males. HL was diagnosed at a median of 8 years after IBD detection and 2 years after commencing immunosuppression. HL had a predilection ( 80 %) to involve the inflamed GI site and the histological subtype was mixed cellularity in 65 % of cases. In-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV)- encoded RNA was positive in all documented cases. HL was diagnosed in stages I , II , IV in 35 % , 20 % and 45 % of the patients , respectively. Notably , 66 % of patients with advanced disease had liver involvement. Immunosuppression was stopped in most ( 69 %) patients at HL diagnosis. Treatment used was either chemotherapy only , surgery followed by chemotherapy , or surgery alone in 50 % , 33 % and 16 % of cases , respectively. Four patients had an IBD flare during HL remission. Patients with IBD who develop GI HL have distinct characteristics; male sex , predominance of CD , preference to develop in inflamed sites , mixed cellularity histology , EBV positivity , and a unique spread to the liver pattern.
