  The physiologic role of free 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D in humans is unclear. To assess whether rise in total versus free 25 ( OH) D is associated with change in downstream biomarkers of 25 ( OH) D entry into target cells in kidney ( 24,25-dihyroxyvitamin D ( 24,25 ( OH) 2D)) and parathyroid ( parathyroid hormone ( PTH)). 16-week randomized controlled trial. 60 mcg ( 2,400 IU)/ day of D3 or 20 mcg/day of 25 ( OH) D3. Academic medical center. 35 adults > 18 years with 25 ( OH) D levels < 20 ng/ml. 24,25 ( OH) 2D , 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D ( 1,25 ( OH) 2D) and PTH. At baseline , participants ( D3 and 25 ( OH) D3 groups combined) were 35.1 Â± 10.6 years. Mean total 25 ( OH) D , free 25 ( OH) D , 24,25 ( OH) 2D , and PTH were 16.6 ng/ml , 4.6 pg/ml , 1.3 ng/ml , and 37.2 pg/ml , respectively. From 0 to 4 weeks , rise in only free 25 ( OH) D was associated with a concurrent 24,25 ( OH) 2D increase ( p = 0.03 , adjusted for change in 1,25 ( OH) 2D and supplementation regimen) and PTH decrease ( p = 0.01 , adjusted for change in calcium and supplementation regimen). Between 4 to 8 weeks , and again from 8 to 16 weeks , rises in both free and total 25 ( OH) D were associated with 24,25 ( OH) 2D increase; in contrast , rise in neither total nor free 25 ( OH) D was associated with PTH decrease during these time periods. Early rise in free 25 ( OH) D during treatment of vitamin D deficiency was more strongly associated with changes in biomarkers of 25 ( OH) D entry into target kidney and parathyroid cells , suggesting a physiologic role of free 25 ( OH) D in humans.
