  Prosthetic joint infection diagnosis is often difficult since biofilm-embedded microorganisms attach well to the prosthetic surfaces and resist their detection by conventional methods. DL-dithiothreitol has been described as a valid method for biofilm detachment on orthopedic devices. We report the case of an occasional detection of Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> in a non immuno-compromised patient with a preoperative diagnosis of aseptic loosening. The infection diagnosis due to such rare bacteria was made postoperatively , thanks to a DL-dithiothreitol-based device. This may be considered a feasible approach for the microbiological analysis of prosthetic joint infection , considering that a prompt diagnosis of such biofilm-associated infections could bring some advantages , such as an early and appropriate antibiotic therapy administration and a reduction of undiagnosed infections.
