  Relative sensitivity factors on glow discharge mass spectrometry were evaluated for unalloyed and alloyed metals of aluminum and magnesium using a glow discharge mass spectrometer operated with fast flow Grimm-type source. All the elements measured could be classified into two groups , i.e. a group of elements could be determined with repeatability equal to or less than 15 % relative standard deviation , while another group could be determined with RSDs of greater than 15 %. The latter is mainly due to the instability of discharge condition and elemental segregation onto certified reference materials.
