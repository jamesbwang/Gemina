  Randomized controlled trial ( RCT) testing surgical intervention faced challenges due to complexities of surgery and made it more difficult for surgeons and methodologists than pharmaceutical providers to build a well-design , conduct RCT. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to address the methodological challenges of RCTs on surgical intervention and offer potential solutions. We searched PubMed in order to summarize 2-arm parallel randomized trials for surgical interventions published in 2013. The information regarding general characteristics , general methodological and special surgical characteristics related to surgical trials comparing alternative procedures was gathered. Some 200 surgical trials were identified. The extent to which these trials in design , conduct and analysis differed substantially across items. The general information about sample size calculation ( 77.0 %) , lost to follow-up ( 71.5 %) , trial registration ( 55.5 %) , protocols of trials ( 56.0 %) , implementation of randomization ( 59.5 %) , concealment of randomization ( 56.0 %); reporting of primary outcome as P value ( 67.0 %). Surgery special information revealed that only 21.0 % of trials considered surgeons ' preference , approximately 12 % to 50 % of them controlled the quality of surgical interventions and none evaluated the effect of the learning curve. There is much room for improvement concerning the reported designs , conduct , and analysis of surgical RCTs. Considering the difficulty of surgical RCTs , some other approaches , such as surgeons ' eligibility , performance of pilot studies , or implementation of pragmatic RCTs/expertise-based trials , should be feasibly implemented to overcome the presented challenges.
