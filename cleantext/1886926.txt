  The use of the Monte Carlo ( MC) method in radiotherapy dosimetry has increased almost exponentially in the last decades. Its widespread use in the field has converted this computer simulation technique in a common tool for reference and treatment planning dosimetry calculations. This work reviews the different MC calculations made on dosimetric quantities , like stopping-power ratios and perturbation correction factors required for reference ionization chamber dosimetry , as well as the fully realistic MC simulations currently available on clinical accelerators , detectors and patient treatment planning. Issues are raised that include the necessity for consistency in the data throughout the entire dosimetry chain in reference dosimetry , and how Bragg-Gray theory breaks down for small photon fields. Both aspects are less critical for MC treatment planning applications , but there are important constraints like tissue characterization and its patient-to-patient variability , which together with the conversion between dose-to-water and dose-to-tissue , are analysed in detail. Although these constraints are common to all methods and algorithms used in different types of treatment planning systems , they make uncertainties involved in MC treatment planning to still remain `` uncertain ''.
