  Groundwater quality should be continuously monitored for irrigation and drinking purpose so that risk from geochemical contaminants can be reduced by appropriate treatment method. Therefore , the focus of the present study was to determine the suitability of groundwater collected from South West Delhi , India , for irrigation and drinking purpose on the basis of various water quality indices. In order to assess the groundwater quality , 50 samples were collected from different sites of selected study area and parameters such as pH , EC ( electrical conductivity) , total dissolved solids ( TDS) , salinity , total hardness ( TH) , total alkalinity ( HCO
