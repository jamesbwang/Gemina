  Inclined , zigzag and spiral TiAg films were prepared by glancing angle co-deposition , using two distinct Ti and Ag targets with a particle incident angle of 80 ° and Ag contents ranging from 20 to 75 at %. The effect of increasing Ag incorporation and columnar architecture change on the morphological , structural and electrical properties of the films was investigated. It is shown that inclined columnar features ( β = 47 °) with high porosity were obtained for 20 at % Ag , with the column angle sharply decreasing ( β = 21 °) for 50 at % Ag , and steeply increasing afterwards until β = 37 ° for the film with 75 at % Ag. The sputtered films exhibit a rather well-crystallized structure for Ag contents ≥ 50 at % , with a TiAg ( 111) preferential growth. No significant oxidation was detected in all films , except for the one with 20 at % Ag , after two 298-473-298 K temperature cycles in air. The calculated temperature coefficient of resistivity ( TCR) values vary between 1.4 and 5.5 × 10
