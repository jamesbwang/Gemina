  Chronic inflammation<symptom> has critical role in Type 2 diabetes ( T2D) , in which IL-1β contributes in insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. The activation of NLRP3 and AIM2 by endogens ligands , such as mtDNA can lead to the release of active form of IL-1β. To evaluate AIM2 expression and activation as well as circulating mtDNA levels in T2D patients. AIM2 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry , it 's activity was assessed by measuring in vitro release of IL-1β induced by Poly ( dA: dT) , and mtDNA copy number was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Increased percent of AIM2 + cells were detected in monocytes from patients with T2D. Moreover , increased levels of IL-1β in monocytes cultures from T2D patients compared to healthy controls were observed. Also , association between AIM2 + cells and hyperglycemia ( r = 0.4385 , P = 0.0095) and triglycerides levels ( r = 0.5112 , P = 0.002) and waist-hip ratio ( r = 0.4710 , P = 0.0049) were detected. Likewise , the mtDNA copy number was augmented in T2D patients compared to control group. The mtDNA copies number was associated with body mass index ( r = 0.4231 , P = 0.0008) and TNF-α levels ( r = 0.5231 , P = 0.0005). In addition , increased levels of IL-12p70 , TNF-a , IL-10 , IL-6 , IL-8 and IL-1β were detected in a serum from T2D patients. These results suggest the involvement of AIM2 and mtDNA in the inflammatory process seen in T2D.
