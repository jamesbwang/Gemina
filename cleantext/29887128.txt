  The freeze-all strategy in high responders is considered to be a safe and effective strategy for in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( IVF/ICSI) treatment; however , the cumulative pregnancy outcomes have not been established. A retrospective , single-center cohort study was conducted and 1311 high-responder patients ( > 20 oocytes retrieved and/or a serum estradiol level > 3000 pg/ml on the triggering day) were recruited from 2006 to 2015. The study group ( n = 351) underwent the freeze-all strategy with subsequent thawed embryo transfer ( ET) , and the control group ( n = 960) received fresh-cycle ET and subsequent thawed ET if needed. A case-control matching analysis was performed to match the two groups for the number of retrieved oocytes. The primary outcomes were the ongoing pregnancy rate ( OPR) of the first ET cycle and the cumulative OPR. After matching , there was a significantly higher OPR in the first ET cycle ( 49.5 % vs. 32.2 % , p < 0.0001; n = 301 in each group) and the cumulative OPR ( 69.4 % vs. 55.1 % , p < 0.0001) in the study group , with significantly fewer total transferred embryos and cycles. The advantages of the freeze-all strategy for the OPR in the first ET cycle ( OR: 1.97 , p < 0.0001) and the cumulative OPR ( OR: 1.49 , p = 0.032) remained statistically significant after adjusting for other possible confounding factors in multivariate logistic regression analysis. For high responders , the freeze-all strategy with thawed ET achieved a significantly higher OPR in the first ET cycle and a higher cumulative OPR than the fresh ET strategy.
