  Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA) in old age is an important indicator of good health and functional capacity enabling independent living. In our prospective twin cohort study with 616 individuals we investigated whether long-term physical activity assessed three times , in 1975 , 1982 and 1990 ( mean age 48 years in 1990) , and other self-reported health habits predict objectively measured MVPA measured with a hip-worn triaxial accelerometer ( at least 10 hours per day for at least 4 days) 25 years later ( mean age of 73 years). Low leisure-time physical activity at younger age , higher relative weight , smoking , low socioeconomic status , and health problems predicted low MVPA in old age in individual-based analyses ( altogether explaining 20.3 % of the variation in MVPA). However , quantitative trait modeling indicated that shared genetic factors explained 82 % of the correlation between baseline and follow-up physical activity. Pairwise analyses within monozygotic twin pairs showed that only baseline smoking was a statistically significant predictor of later-life MVPA. The results imply that younger-age physical activity is associated with later-life MVPA , but shared genetic factors underlies this association. Of the other predictors mid-life smoking predicted less physical activity at older age independent of genetic factors.
