  Study Design Randomized clinical trial , etiology. Background Training intensity and volume have been proposed to be associated with specific running-related injuries. If such an association exists , secondary preventive measures could be initiated by clinicians based on symptoms of a specific injury diagnosis. Objectives To test the following hypotheses: ( i) A running schedule focusing on intensity will increase the risk of sustaining Achilles tendinopathy , gastrocnemius injuries and plantar fasciitis<disease> compared with hypothesized volume-related injuries. ( ii) A running schedule focusing on running volume will increase the risk of sustaining patellofemoral pain syndrome<disease> , iliotibial band syndrome<disease> and patellar tendinopathy compared with hypothesized intensity-related injuries. Methods Healthy recreational runners were included in a 24-week follow-up , divided into 8-week preconditioning and 16-week specific focus-training. Participants were randomized to one of two running schedules: Schedule Intensity ( Sch-I) or Schedule Volume ( Sch-V). Sch-I progressed the amount of high intensity running ( â‰¥ 88 % VO2max) each week. Sch-V progressed total weekly running volume. Global positioning system watch or smartphone collected data on running. Running-related injuries were diagnosed based on a clinical examination. Estimates were risk difference ( RD) and 95 % CI. Results Of 447 runners , a total of 80 sustained an injury ( Sch-I n = 36; Sch-V n = 44). Risk of intensity injuries in Sch-I were: RD
