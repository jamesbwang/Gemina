  We report on the formation of slantwise-oriented periodic subwavelength ripple structures on chromium surfaces irradiated by single-beam femtosecond laser pulses at normal incidence. Unexpectedly , the ripples slanted in opposite directions on each side the laser-scanned area , neither perpendicular nor parallel to the laser polarization. The modulation depth was also found to change from one ripple to the next ripple. A theoretical model is provided to explain our observations , and excellent agreement is shown between the simulations and the experimental results. Moreover , the validity of our theory is also confirmed on bulk chromium surfaces. Our study provides insights for better understanding and control of femtosecond laser nanostructuring.
