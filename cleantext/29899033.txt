  The decrease in number of AMPA-type glutamate receptor ( AMPAR) at excitatory synapses causes LTD , a cellular basis of learning and memory. The number of postsynaptic AMPARs is regulated by the balance<symptom> of exocytosis and endocytosis , and enhanced endocytosis of AMPAR has been suggested to underlie the LTD expression. However , it remains unclear how endocytosis and exocytosis of AMPAR change during LTD.. In this study , we addressed this question by analyzing exocytosis and endocytosis of AMPAR by imaging super-ecliptic pHlorin ( SEP)- tagged AMPAR around postsynaptic structure formed directly on the glass surface in the hippocampal culture prepared from rat embryos of both sexes. Contrary to a prevailing view on the LTD expression by endocytosis enhancement , the LTD induction by NMDA application only transiently enhanced endocytosis of SEP-tagged GluA1 subunits of AMPAR , which was counteracted by simultaneous augmentation of exocytosis. As a result , soon after the start of the LTD induction ( âˆ¼ 1 min) , the surface AMPAR did not markedly decrease. Thereafter , the surface GluA1-SEP gradually decreased ( 2-5 min) and kept at a low level until the end of observation ( > 30 min). Surprisingly , this gradual and sustained decrease of surface AMPAR was accompanied not by the enhanced endocytic events of GluA1 , but by the suppression of exocytosis. Together , our data highlight an unprecedented mechanism for the LTD expression by attenuation of exocytosis of AMPAR , but not by enhanced endocytosis , together with a reduction of postsynaptic AMPAR scaffolding protein PSD95.
