  Diffusion of information in complex networks largely depends on the network structure. Recent studies have mainly addressed information diffusion in homogeneous networks where there is only a single type of nodes and edges. However , some real-world networks consist of heterogeneous types of nodes and edges. In this manuscript , we model information diffusion in heterogeneous information networks , and use interactions of different meta-paths to predict the diffusion process. A meta-path is a path between nodes across different layers of a heterogeneous network. As its most important feature the proposed method is capable of determining the influence of all meta-paths on the diffusion process. A conditional probability is used assuming interdependent relations between the nodes to calculate the activation probability of each node. As independent cascade models , we consider linear threshold and independent cascade models. Applying the proposed method on two real heterogeneous networks reveals its effectiveness and superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.
