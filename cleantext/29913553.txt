  Muscle mitochondria are crucial for systemic metabolic function , yet their regulation remains unclear. The zinc finger MYND domain-containing protein 17 ( Zmynd17) was recently identified as a muscle-specific gene in mammals. Here , we investigated the role of Zmynd17 in mice. We found Zmynd17 predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle , especially in fast glycolytic muscle. Genetic Zmynd17 inactivation led to morphologic and functional abnormalities in muscle mitochondria , resulting in decreased respiratory function. Metabolic stress induced by a high-fat diet upregulated Zmynd17 expression and further exacerbated muscle mitochondrial morphology in Zmynd17-deficient mice. Strikingly , Zmynd17 deficiency significantly aggravated metabolic stress-induced hepatic steatosis , glucose intolerance , and insulin resistance. Furthermore , middle-aged mice lacking Zmynd17 exhibited impaired aerobic exercise performance , glucose intolerance , and insulin resistance. Thus , our results indicate that Zmynd17 is a metabolic stress-inducible factor that maintains muscle mitochondrial integrity , with its deficiency profoundly affecting whole-body glucose metabolism.-Fujita , R. , Yoshioka , K. , Seko , D. , Suematsu , T. , Mitsuhashi , S. , Senoo , N. , Miura , S. , Nishino , I. , Ono , Y.
