  Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 ( SMARD1) is a fatal motoneuron disorder in children with unknown etiology. The disease is caused by mutations in the IGHMBP2 gene , encoding a Super Family 1 ( SF1)- type RNA/DNA helicase. IGHMBP2 is a cytosolic protein that binds to ribosomes and polysomes , suggesting a role in mRNA metabolism. Here we performed morphological and functional analyses of isolated immunoglobulin μ-binding protein 2 ( Ighmbp2)- deficient motoneurons to address the question whether the SMARD1 phenotype results from de-regulation of protein biosynthesis. Ighmbp2-deficient motoneurons exhibited only moderate morphological aberrations such as a slight increase of axonal branches. Consistent with the rather mild phenotypic aberrations , RNA sequencing of Ighmbp2-deficient motoneurons revealed only minor transcriptome alterations compared to controls. Likewise , we did not detect any global changes in protein synthesis using pulsed SILAC ( Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture) , FUNCAT ( FlUorescent Non-Canonical Amino acid Tagging) and SUnSET ( SUrface SEnsing of Translation) approaches. However , we observed reduced β-actin protein levels at the growth cone of Ighmbp2-deficient motoneurons which was accompanied by reduced level of IMP1/ZBP1 , a known interactor of β-actin mRNA. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching ( FRAP) studies revealed translational down-regulation of an eGFP-
