  This study identified and investigated the relationship between demographics , mental health problems , positive personality traits and perceived social support and motivation in medical education ( MME) among first year medical students. One hundred-thirty eight first year medical students completed the Academic Motivation Scale , Outcome Inventory , Strength Based Inventory , and Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support. Path analysis was conducted to identify relationships between the variables of interest and each type of motivation , including intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and amotivation. The mean age of the sample was 18.86 Â± 0.74 and 60 % of the subjects were female. Path analysis showed that extrinsic motivation was positively associated with being female , personal choice for studying medicine , and grade point average at high school. Intrinsic motivation was correlated with perceived family support , personal choice for studying medicine and the positive attribute of determination. Amotivation was related to being male , personal choice , and depression<symptom> While both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation were correlated , they were uncorrelated with amotivation. All variables accounted for 18 , 13 , and 45 % of variance of intrinsic motivation , extrinsic motivation and amotivation , respectively. Each type of motivation has different but related predictors. Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation can be promoted , whereas amotivation represents an exclusive issue , one related more to depression<symptom> , that needs to be reduced to not interfere with academic achievement and quality of life of medical students.
