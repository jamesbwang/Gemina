  Effective iron chelation therapy is an important part of treatment in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia and lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS). Key strategies for optimising iron chelation therapy include ensuring good adherence and preventing and managing adverse events ( AEs). Good adherence to iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine and deferasirox has been linked to improved survival and/or reductions in complications related to iron overload; however , maintaining good adherence to iron chelators can be challenging. Patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia or lower-risk MDS showed better adherence to the deferasirox film-coated tablet ( FCT) formulation than to the deferasirox dispersible tablet formulation in the ECLIPSE trial , reflecting in part the improved palatability and convenience of deferasirox FCT. As well as affecting adherence , AEs may lead to dose reduction , interruption or discontinuation , resulting in suboptimal iron chelation therapy. Preventing and successfully managing AEs may help limit their impact on adherence , and following dosage and administration recommendations for iron chelators such as deferasirox may help minimise AEs and optimise treatment in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia and lower-risk MDS.
