  Nicotine has been shown to modulate neuroplasticity , cognition , and learning processes in smokers and non-smokers. A possible mechanism for its effect on learning and memory formation is its impact on long-term depression<symptom> and long-term potentiation ( LTP). Nicotine abstinence in smokers is often correlated with impaired cognitive performance. As neuroplasticity is closely connected to learning and memory formation , we aimed to explore the effect of nicotine spray administration in deprived smokers on paired-associative stimulation ( PAS25)- induced neuroplasticity and on performance of the serial reaction time task ( SRTT) , a sequential motor learning paradigm. Deprived smokers (
