  Acute thrombosis is a crucial cause of bioresorbable vascular graft ( BVG) failure. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell ( BM-MNC)- seeded BVGs demonstrated high graft patency , however , the effect of seeded BM-MNCs against thrombosis remains to be elucidated. Thus , we evaluated an antithrombotic effect of BM-MNC-seeding and utilized platelet-depletion mouse models to evaluate the contribution of platelets to acute thrombosis of BVGs. BVGs were composed of poly ( glycolic acid) mesh sealed with poly ( l-lactideco-Îµ-caprolactone). BM-MNC-seeded BVGs and unseeded BVGs were implanted to wild type C57BL/6 mice ( n = 10/group) as inferior vena cava interposition conduits. To evaluate platelet effect on acute thrombosis , c-Mpl BM-MNC-seeding and the reduction in platelet number prevented BVG thrombosis and improved BVG patency , and those results might be caused by inhibiting platelet adhesion to the BVG.
