  Revision of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty ( UKA) to total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) is technically demanding but can be performed with computer navigation system guidance. The purpose of this study was ( 1) to compare the outcomes of revision of UKA to TKA to those of primary TKA and ( 2) to describe a surgical technique for the revision of UKA to TKA using a navigation system. From May 2011 to April 2014 , a total of 298 knees underwent primary navigation-assisted TKA ( group 1) , and navigation-assisted UKA revision to TKA was performed in 15 patients ( group 2). One to three propensity score matching was performed to compare the two groups after a minimum of three years of follow-up. Radiographic and clinical outcomes in addition to radiolucent lines were evaluated during follow-up. In group 1 , there was one case that required metal block augmentation with the long stem under the tibial plate due to severe bone loss , while in other cases , short stems were used , and cement and autogenous bone grafts were used to fill bone defects due to minimal bone loss. Pre- and post-operative outcomes were significantly improved in both groups ( p < 0.001). There were no statistical differences between groups in pre- and post-operative outcomes except post-operative Knee Society Function Score ( KSFS) ( p = 0.008). There were no radiolucent lines in the tibia or femur in either group during follow-up. With the use of an appropriate surgical technique , navigation-assisted revision of UKA to TKA can yield clinical and radiologic outcomes comparable to those of primary navigation-assisted TKA.
