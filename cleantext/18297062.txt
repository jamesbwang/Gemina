  Distinct members of the Ets family of transcription factors act as positive or negative regulators of genes involved in cellular proliferation , development , and tumorigenesis. In human lung cancer , increased ETS1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. We tested whether ETS1 contributes to lung tumorigenesis by binding to Twist1 , a gene involved in tumor cell motility and dissemination. We used a mouse lung cancer model with metastasis driven by conditionally activated Kras and concurrent tumor suppressor Lkb1 loss ( Kras
