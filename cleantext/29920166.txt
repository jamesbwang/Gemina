  Exposure to suicidal behavior ( ESB) through social networks is often associated with an increased risk of suicidality , but empirical research-largely limited to the Western populations-has produced mixed results. Using survey data , we examined ( a) the association between ESB and suicide attempt , and ( b) the exacerbating role of ESB on gender differences in suicide attempt risk among Turkish adolescents ( N = 2035). ESB was significantly associated with increased risk of suicide attempt , and it contributed to the higher attempt risk among girls. Suicidal behaviors spread through social networks via ESB , and suicide contagion exacerbates the existing gender differences.
