  We aimed to evaluate the isolation of strains contained in the Infloran â„¢ probiotic preparation in blood cultures and its efficacy in reducing necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> ( NEC) and late-onset sepsis<disease> ( LOS) in extremely preterm infants. Routine use of probiotics was implemented in 2008. Infants born at < 28 weeks gestational age were prospectively followed and compared with historical controls ( HC) born between 2005 and 2008. Data on sepsis<disease> due to any of the two probiotic strains contained in Infloran and rates of LOS and NEC were analysed. A total of 516 infants were included. During the probiotic period ( PC) , none of the strains included in the administered probiotic product were isolated from blood cultures. Probiotic administration was associated with an increase in NEC stage II or higher ( HC 10/170 ( 5.9 %); PC 46/346 ( 13.3 %); P = 0.010). Surgical NEC was 12.1 % in PC ( 42/346) versus 5.9 % ( 10/170) in HC ( P = 0.029). Adjusting for confounders ( sex , gestational age , antenatal steroids and human milk) did not change those trends ( P = 0.019). Overall , clinical LOS and the incidence of staphylococcal sepsis<disease> were lower in PC ( 172/342 , 50.3 , and 37 % , respectively) compared with HC ( 102/169 , 60.3 and 50.9 % , respectively) ( P = 0.038 and P = 0.003 , respectively). No episodes of sepsis<disease> attributable to the probiotic product were recorded. The period of probiotic administration was associated with an increased incidence of NEC after adjusting for neonatal factors , but also with a reduction in the LOS rate.
