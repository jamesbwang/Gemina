  Superparamagnetic nanoparticles of iron oxide ( SPION) were shown to be non-inferior to standard radioisotope tracer in breast cancer and may be used as an alternative to identify sentinel lymph nodes ( SLN). The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of sentinel lymph node dissection ( SLND) using SPION in prostate cancer and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy. Twenty patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled in 2016. After intraprostatic injection of SPION , SLND using magnetometer was performed the following day. Extended pelvic lymph node dissection ( ePLND) was added as a reference standard test. The diagnostic performance of the test were evaluated , as well as the rate of in vivo detected SLN. Surgical times of SLND and ePLND were compared using paired two-sample t test. In total , 97 SLN were detected with median 5 ( IQR 3-7) per patient. Non-diagnostic rate of the procedure was 5 %. In total , 19 nodal metastases were found in 5 patients , of which 12 were located in SLN. The sensitivity per patient for the whole cohort was 80 % and per node 56 %. If only patients with at least one detected SLN were considered , the sensitivity per patient and per node reached 100 and 82 % , respectively. A median of 20 LNs ( IQR 18-22) were removed by subsequent ePLND. Surgical times of SLND and ePLND differed significantly , with medians of 17 and 39 min , respectively ( p < 0.001). SLND with SPION is feasible and safe in prostate cancer and the diagnostic accuracy is comparable to the published results of radioguided procedures. In open surgery , SPION may be used as an alternative tracer with its main advantage being the lack of radiation hazard.
