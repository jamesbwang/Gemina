  The radiological features of lower-grade gliomas ( LGGs) classified according to isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH) mutations and codeletion of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q ( 1p/19q codeletion) remain unclear. We aimed to systematically characterize the radiological features of molecularly classified LGGs using IDH and 1p/19q codeletion statuses. One hundred and one LGGs were re-classified into 36 tumors with IDH mutations ( IDH-Mut) , 35 tumors with IDH-Mut and 1p/19q codeletion ( IDH-Mut/Codel) , and 30 tumors with wildtype IDH ( IDH-Wt). Calcification , heterogeneous signal intensity in T2-weighted images , and cortical invasion were significantly more frequent in IDH-Mut/Codel than in IDH-Mut and IDH-Wt tumors ( calcification: 48.6 vs 5.6 and 6.7 % , heterogeneity: 94.3 vs 33.3 and 50 % , and cortical invasion: 94.3 vs 55.6 and 40.0 % , respectively). A frontal location was significantly more frequent for IDH-Mut and IDH-Mut/Codel than for IDH-Wt tumors ( 52.8 and 71.4 vs 12.1 % , respectively) , and dense contrast-enhancement was significantly more frequent in IDH-Wt than in IDH-Mut and IDH-Mut/Codel tumors ( 50.0 vs 2.8 and 2.9 % , respectively). In conclusion , IDH-Mut/Codel tumors were characterized by calcification , frontal location , heterogeneous signal intensity , and cortical invasion; IDH-Mut tumors differed from IDH-Wt tumors according to predominant frontal lobe location and less frequent dense enhancement patterns.
