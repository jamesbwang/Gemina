  Alpha-ketoglutarate ( AKG) , a critical molecule in the tricarboxylic acid cycle , is beneficial to intestinal functions. However , its influence on intestinal microbiota and metabolism is not fully understood. We investigated the effects of a low-protein ( LP) diet supplemented with AKG on cecal microbial communities and the parameters of microbial metabolism in growing pigs. Twenty-seven young pigs ( Large White × Landrace) with an average initial body<symptom> weight of 11.96 ± 0.18 kg were randomly allotted into three groups (
