  Sparse lipid fluorination enhances the lipids ' 1H signal dispersion , enables clean molecular distinction by 19F NMR , and evinces micelle insertion of proteins via fluorine-induced signal shifts. We present a minimal fluorination scheme , and illustrate the concept on di- ( 4-fluoro)- heptanoylphosphatidylcholine micelles and solubilised seven-helix transmembrane pSRII protein.
