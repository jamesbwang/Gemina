  In the underdoped regime , the cuprate high-temperature superconductors exhibit a host of unusual collective phenomena , including unconventional spin and charge density modulations , Fermi surface reconstructions , and a pseudogap in various physical observables. Conversely , overdoped cuprates are generally regarded as conventional Fermi liquids possessing no collective electronic order. In partial contradiction to this widely held picture , we report resonant X-ray scattering measurements revealing incommensurate charge order reflections for overdoped ( Bi , Pb)
