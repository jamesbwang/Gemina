  To investigate associations between the age of menopause and the DNA methylation levels of two repetitive elements , Alu and LINE-1 , we performed plasma DNA extraction on 161 subjects and serum cell-free DNA extraction on 120 subjects. We grouped women by menopausal age as follows: ≤ 48 years ( earlier menopause) , ≥ 52 years ( later menopause) , and 48-52 years ( control). The DNA methylation levels of Alu and LINE-1 were measured by MethyLight PCR. The results showed that the DNA methylation levels of both Alu and LINE-1 were inversely correlated with menopausal age in the plasma DNA cohort ( r = 0.079 ,
