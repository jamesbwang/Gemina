  JC virus ( JCV) , a ubiquitous human<pathogen> polyomavirus<pathogen> , can cause fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) in immune compromised patients. The viral genome is composed of two conserved coding regions separated by a highly variable non-coding control region ( NCCR). We analyzed the NCCR sequence from 10 PML JCV strains and found new mutations. Remarkably , the NCCR f section was mutated in most cases. We therefore explored the importance of this section in JCV expression in renal ( HEK293H) and glioblastoma ( U-87MG) cell lines , by adapting the emerging technology of DNA minicircles. Using bidirectional fluorescent reporters , we revealed that impaired NCCR-driven late expression in glioblastoma cells was restored by a short deletion overlapping e and f sections. This study evidenced a relevant link between JCV NCCR polymorphism and cell-type dependent expression. The use of DNA minicircles opens new insights for monitoring the impact of NCCR variation.
