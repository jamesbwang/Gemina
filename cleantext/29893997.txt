  To evaluate the local specific absorption rate ( SAR) and heating around retained cardiac leads during MRI at 64 MHz ( 1.5 T) and 127 MHz ( 3T) as a function of RF coil type and imaging landmark. Numerical models of retained cardiac leads were built from CT and X-ray images of 6 patients with retained cardiac leads. Electromagnetic simulations and bio-heat modeling were performed with MRI RF body and head coils tuned to 64 MHz and 127 MHz and positioned at 9 different imaging landmarks covering an area from the head<symptom> to the lower limbs. For all patients and at both 1.5 T and 3T , local transmit head coils produced negligible temperature rise ( ΔT < 0.1 °C) for ‖ ‖ B1 + ‖ ‖ ≤ 3 μT. For body imaging with quadrature-driven coils at 1.5 T , ΔT during a 10-min scan remained < 3 °C at all imaging landmarks for ‖ ‖ B1 + ‖ ‖ ≤ 3 μT and < 6 °C for ‖ ‖ B1 + ‖ ‖ ≤ 4 μT. For body imaging at 3T , ΔT during a 10-min scan remained < 6 °C at all imaging landmarks for ‖ ‖ B1 + ‖ ‖ ≤ 2 μT. For shorter pulse sequences up to 2 min , ΔT remained < 6 °C for ‖ ‖ B1 + ‖ ‖ ≤ 3 μT. For the models based on 6 patients studied , simulations suggest that MRI could be performed safely using a local head coil at both 1.5 T and 3T , and with a body coil at 1.5 T with pulses that produced ‖ ‖ B1 + ‖ ‖ ≤ 4 μT. MRI at 3T could be performed safely in these patients using pulses with ‖ ‖ B1 + ‖ ‖ ≤ 2 μT.
