  In plant cells , vacuoles are extremely important for growth and development , and influence important cellular functions as photosynthesis , respiration<symptom> , and transpiration. Plant cells contain lytic and storage vacuoles , whose size can be different depending on cell type and tissue developmental stage. One of the main roles of vacuoles is to regulate the cell turgor in response to different stimuli. Thus , studying the morphology , dynamics , and physiology of vacuole is fundamentally important to advance knowledge in plant cell biology at large. The availability of fluorescent probes allows marking vacuoles in multiple ways. These may be fast , when using commercially available chemical dyes , or relatively slow , in the case of specific genetically encoded markers based on proteins directed either to the membrane of the vacuole ( tonoplast) or to the vacuole lumen. Any of these approaches provides useful information about the morphology and physiology of the vacuole.
