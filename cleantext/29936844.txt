  Triggered by the recent successful observation of previously predicted phonon chirality in the monolayer tungsten diselenide ( Science 2018 , 359 , 579) , we systematically study the chiral phonons in the classical heterostructure of graphene/hexagonal boron nitride ( G/ h-BN) by first-principles calculations. It is found that the broken inversion symmetry and the interlayer interaction of G/ h-BN not only open the phononic gaps but also lift the degeneracy of left-handed and right-handed chiral phonons at the first-Brillouin-zone corners ( valleys). At valleys , the hybridization makes chiral phonon modes solely contributed from one individual layer. Moreover , we demonstrate that the vertical stress is effective to tune the degenerated phononic gap while keeping the valley-phonon chirality of G/ h-BN heterostructure , which is favorable for the Raman or ultrafast infrared spectroscopy measurement. We also analyze the pseudoangular momentum of valley-phonon modes , which provide important references for the excitation and measurement of the chiral phonons in the process of electronic intervalley scattering. Collectively , our results on the chiral phonons in the G/ h-BN heterostructure system could stimulate more experimental and theoretical studies and promote the future applications on the phonon-chirality-based phononics.
