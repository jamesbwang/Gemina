  Mental health literacy ( MHL) is considered a prerequisite for early recognition and intervention in mental disorders , and for this reason , it has become a focus of research over the past few decades. Assessing this construct is relevant for identifying knowledge gaps and erroneous beliefs concerning mental health issues , to inform the development of interventions aimed at promoting mental health literacy as well as the evaluation of these interventions. Recently , we developed a new self-reporting measure ( MHLq) for assessing mental health literacy in young people ( 12 ‚Åª 14 years-old) , meeting the need to assess MHL from a comprehensive perspective of the construct instead of focusing on a restricted number of mental disorders or specific dimensions ( e.g. , knowledge concerning specific disorders; stigma). The present study aimed to adapt the MHLq for the young adult population and to examine its psychometric properties , according to the following steps: ( 1) item adaptation , using a think aloud procedure ( n = 5); ( 2) data collection ( n = 356 , aged between 18 and 25 years old; and ( 3) psychometric analyses ( exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency analysis). The final version of the questionnaire included 29 items ( total scale & alpha; = 0.84) , organized by four dimensions: ( 1) knowledge of mental health problems ( & alpha; = 0.74); ( 2) erroneous beliefs/stereotypes ( & alpha; = 0.72); ( 3) help-seeking and first aid skills ( & alpha; = 0.71); and ( 4) self-help strategies ( & alpha; = 0.60). The results suggest that the MHLq-adult form is a practical , valid , and reliable screening tool for identifying gaps in knowledge , beliefs , and behavioral intentions related to mental health and mental disorders , planning promotion programs , and evaluating intervention effectiveness.
