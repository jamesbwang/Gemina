  The vermiform appendix serves as a `` safe house '' for maintaining normal gut bacteria and appendectomy may impair the intestinal microbiota. Appendectomy is expected to profoundly alter the immune system and modulate the pathogenic inflammatory immune responses of the gut. Recent studies have shown that a dysbiotic gut increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease ( CKD). Therefore , we hypothesized that appendectomy would increase the risk of CKD. This nationwide , population-based , propensity-score-matched cohort study included 10,383 patients who underwent appendectomy and 41,532 propensity-score-matched controls. Data were collected by the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 2000 to 2013. We examined the associations between appendectomy and CKD and end-stage renal disease ( ESRD). The major outcome was a new diagnosis of CKD based on an outpatient diagnosis made at least three times or hospital discharge diagnosis made once during the follow-up period. ESRD was defined as undergoing dialysis therapy for at least 90 days , as in previous studies. The incidence rates of CKD and ESRD were higher in the appendectomy group than in the control cohort ( CKD: 6.52 vs. 5.93 per 1,000 person-years , respectively; ESRD: 0.49 vs. 0.31 per 1,000 person-years , respectively). Appendectomy patients also had a higher risk of developing CKD ( adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR) 1.13; 95 % CI ( 1.01-1.26); Appendectomy increases the risk of developing CKD and ESRD , especially in diabetic patients. Physicians should pay close attention to renal function prognosis in appendectomy patients.
