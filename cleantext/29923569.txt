  Microfluidics brings unique opportunities for the synthesis of nanomaterials toward efficient liquid biopsy. Herein , we developed the microreactor-enabled flow synthesis of immunomagnetic nanomaterials with controllable shapes ( sphere , cube , rod , and belt) by simply tuning the flow rates. The particle shape-dependent screening efficiency of circulating tumor cells was first investigated and compared with commercial ferrofluids , providing new insights into the rational design of a particulate system toward the screening and analysis of circulating tumor biomarkers.
