  Cannabis use among youth is of significant concern given the potential negative health impacts on young people. This study describes the mental health characteristics , cannabis use , and substance use profiles of youth aged 14 to 24 years seen at the Youth Addiction and Concurrent Disorders Service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health , through an age and gender lens. Almost all participating youth indicated lifetime cannabis use. Substance use and mental health profiles among those indicating a history of cannabis use differed along sex and age. Male youth were more likely to use cannabis more frequently , while female youth were more likely to use greater variety of substances and display more co-occurring mental health problems. Adolescent problematic substance use tended to co-occur with externalizing problems whereas problematic young adult substance use tended to co-occur with internalizing problems. Implications for the integrated , coordinated care of substance use and mental health concerns , with attention to the unique needs of subgroups of youth , are discussed.
