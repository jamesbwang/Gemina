  Risk adjustment models for intensive care outcomes have yet to realize the full potential of data unlocked by the increasing adoption of EHRs. In particular , they fail to fully leverage the information present in longitudinal , structured clinical data- including laboratory test results and vital signs- nor can they infer patient state from unstructured clinical narratives without lengthy manual abstraction. A fully electronic ICU risk model fusing these two types of data sources may yield improved accuracy and more personalized risk estimates , and in obviating manual abstraction , could also be used for real-time decision-making. As a first step towards fully `` electronic '' ICU models based on fused data , we present results of generalized additive modeling applied to a sample of over 36,000 ICU patients. Our approach outperforms those based on the SAPS and OASIS systems ( A UC: 0.908 vs. 0.794 and 0.874) , and appears to yield more granular and easily visualized risk estimates.
