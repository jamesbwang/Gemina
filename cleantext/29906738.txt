  The effect of dried tomato pomace ( DTP) was tested on lamb performances , meat fatty acids and oxidative stability. For 36 days , one group of lambs ( n = 7; CON) was fed a commercial concentrate , while the other group ( n = 7; DTP) received DTP in addition to CON diet. The administration of DTP reduced ( P < .05) concentrate intake , with no effect on animal performances. The DTP treatment tended to increase total polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA; P = .075) , PUFA n-6 ( P = .071) , α-linolenic acid ( P = .096) and increased linoleic acid ( P < .05) , γ-tocopherol ( P < .001) and retinol ( P < .001) in meat. In raw meat , DTP treatment increased L * ( P = .059) , b * ( P < .05) , C * ( P = .052) and H * ( P < .05) values compared to CON , while lipid oxidation was not affected. In meat homogenates incubated with pro-oxidants , DTP tended to reduce 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS; P = .088). Therefore , DTP supplementation decreased the consumption of commercial concentrate without detrimental effects on animal performances and meat quality traits.
