  Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome<disease> ( vEDS) is a rare condition characterized by connective tissue fragility. Direct spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistula<disease> ( sCCF) is reportedly pathognomonic of vEDS. We conducted this study to understand the possible mechanisms of occurrence of sCCF in this subset of patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a monocentric vEDS cohort along with a literature review regarding sCCF in this condition. Of 133 patients regularly followed in our centre between 2000 and 2017 , 13 ( 9.8 %) had a diagnosis of direct sCCF ( 92.3 % female , median age 33.0 years , interquartile range ( IQR) ( 26.0-39.5)). There were 7 Glycine missense and 6 splice-site variants but no variant leading to haploinsufficiency. The literature search identified 97 vEDS patients with direct sCCF ( 79.4 % female , 7.2 % sex not reported , median age 31.0 years , IQR ( 24.0-39.0)). Increased carotid circumferential wall stress , higher carotid distensibility and lower carotid intima-media thickness could contribute to a higher risk for direct sCCF in vEDS. There is no predictive factor for the occurrence of sCCF apart from female sex in vEDS. In vEDS , anatomical and pathophysiological features of the intra-cavernous internal carotid artery make it prone to shunting in the cavernous sinus , due either to a spontaneous rupture or to a spontaneous dissection with pseudoaneurysm formation. Direct sCCF in seemingly healthy young individuals should be highly suggestive of vEDS and prompt further investigation.
