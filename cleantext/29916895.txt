  To determine whether percutaneous transiliac-transsacral screw fixation improves pain , ambulation , length of stay , and the rate of disposition to home in patients with sacral fragility fractures. Retrospective cohort study. Single academic level 1 trauma center. Elderly patients who presented with an isolated sacral fragility fracture between August 2015 and August 2017. Of the 41 patients included in the study , 16 were treated operatively and 25 were treated non-operatively. Percutaneous transiliac-transsacral screw fixation MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS:: Pain , ambulation , length of stay , complications , disposition. Patients treated operatively reported a greater improvement in pain as measured by the Visual Analog scale ( 3.9 points vs. 0.6 points , p < 0.001). At the time of discharge , 100 % of surgically treated patients were able to ambulate , compared to 72 % in the non-operative group ( p = 0.03). Average distance ambulating at the time of discharge was higher in the operative group ( 95 ft vs. 35 ft , p < 0.01). Length of stay was similar between the two groups ( 3.6 days in operative group vs. 4.2 days in non-operative group , p = 0.5). Of the patients treated operatively , 75 % were discharged to home , compared to only 20 % in the non-operative group ( p < 0.001). There were no complications related to surgery. Percutaneous transiliac-transsacral screw fixation of sacral fragility fractures lessens pain , improves ambulation , and increases the rate of disposition to home. Further investigation is needed to determine if surgical fixation provides benefit with regards to medium and long-term outcome variables. Therapeutic Level III.
