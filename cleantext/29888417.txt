  The role of mechanistic evidence tends to be under-appreciated in current evidence-based medicine ( EBM) , which focusses on clinical studies , tending to restrict attention to randomized controlled studies ( RCTs) when they are available. The EBM + programme seeks to redress this imbalance , by suggesting methods for evaluating mechanistic studies alongside clinical studies. Drug approval is a problematic case for the view that mechanistic evidence should be taken into account , because RCTs are almost always available. Nevertheless , we argue that mechanistic evidence is central to all the key tasks in the drug approval process: in drug discovery and development; assessing pharmaceutical quality; devising dosage regimens; assessing efficacy , harms , external validity , and cost-effectiveness; evaluating adherence; and extending product licences. We recommend that , when preparing for meetings in which any aspect of drug approval is to be discussed , mechanistic evidence should be systematically analysed and presented to the committee members alongside analyses of clinical studies.
