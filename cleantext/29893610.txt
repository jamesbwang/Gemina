  This study examined the associations between sedentary behavior , physical activity , and health care expenditures among Chinese older adults. We conducted a survey on 4,165 older men and women living in major cities in China. Sedentary behavior and physical activity were measured by the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly ( PASE) questionnaire. Healthcare costs were assessed by self-reported out-of-pocket health care expenditures across outpatient care , inpatient care , medication , and formal caregiver expenses. Sedentary behavior was associated with an increase in annual out-of-pocket health care expenditures by approximately USD$ 37 for each additional sedentary hour ( p < 0.001). Physical activity was associated with a decrease in annual health care expenditures by approximately USD$ 1.2 for each 1 PASE score ( p < 0.001). Physical activity was a less salient indicator of health care expenditure for men than women. Reducing sedentary behavior among older men and women and promoting physical activity , especially among men , may be important strategies to reduce out-of-pocket health care expenditures in China.
