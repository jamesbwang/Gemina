  Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is a neurological disease of the central nervous system which can lead to a range of severe physical disabilities. A large proportion of those affected will experience cognitive impairment , which is associated with a worse prognosis. Effective assessment of cognition in MS has been problematic due to a lack of suitable scales. The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis ( BICAMS) was developed in 2010 as part of an international endeavour to facilitate cognitive assessment. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesise the available literature published as part of the BICAMS international validation protocol. A literature search conducted using PubMed , PsycINFO and Google Scholar identified 16 studies for inclusion in the systematic review , 14 of which could be included in a meta-analysis. BICAMS has been widely validated across 11 languages and 14 individual cultures and locations. The meta-analysis demonstrated that BICAMS identified significantly reduced cognitive functioning in adults with MS compared to healthy controls. This was true for all three cognitive domains assessed by BICAMS: information processing speed ( g = 0.943 , 95 % CI 0.839 , 1.046 , g < 0.001) , immediate verbal recall memory ( g = 0.688 , 95 % CI 0.554 , 0.822 , p < 0.001) and immediate visual recall memory ( g = 0.635 , 95 % CI 0.534 , 0.736 , p < 0.001). BICAMS has been widely applied across cultures and languages to assess cognition in MS. BICAMS offers a feasible , cost-effective means of assessing cognition in MS worldwide. Further validation studies are underway to support this project.
