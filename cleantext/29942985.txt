  Despite high profile examples that are highlighted in the popular media , we know little about high-cost prosocial behaviors such as defending and including , and how these behaviors might change over time and vary by individual. Thus , this study explored defending and including behaviors across the transition to adulthood by assessing growth and profiles of these high-cost prosocial behaviors over a four-year time span. In addition the study explored gender , emotional ( sympathy) , cognitive ( personal values) , individual ( self-esteem) , and relational ( maternal warmth) factors during adolescence that predicted profiles of defending and including during the transition to adulthood. Participants were 469 individuals ( 52 % female , 70 % European American) who participated at four time points ( ages 18-21). Growth curve analyses showed that defending and including behaviors decreased slightly across the transition to adulthood and these behaviors tended to vary as a function of the target of the behavior. Latent profile analyses revealed three groups at each age , one with low , one with medium , and one with high levels of defending and including. The discussion focused on the prevalence and change in defending and including behaviors during the transition to adulthood , as well as the variability that exists in high-cost behavioral profiles.
