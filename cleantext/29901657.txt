  HIV-infected patients are living longer and are at increased risk of comorbidities. A qualified physician workforce is needed to care for this growing HIV<pathogen> population. This report describes the first 5 years of the development and implementation of a novel 3-year HIV<pathogen> Training Track ( HIV<pathogen> TT) within the Primary Care Residency Program from 2012 to 2017. It outlines the process of building the infrastructure of the HIV<pathogen> TT , describes the curriculum development based on HIV-specific Entrustable Professional Activities ( EPA) , and provides the results of the program evaluation in the 5 year period OUTCOMES:: The program enrolled a cohort of 11 trainees with 5 graduates. Each trainee managed a panel of 30-40 HIV<pathogen> patients with diverse demographics. A medical record review revealed high performance measures in the management of HIV<pathogen> and non-HIV medical conditions. All trainees exhibited progress on their EPAs and showed increase in their knowledge assessment test scores. There was 100 % retention of trainees and faculty. Trainees and patients demonstrated satisfaction with the program. Establishing an HIV<pathogen> TT is feasible and can be successfully implemented. This report highlights the first steps and early-stage initiative at a single institution and lays groundwork toward building a workforce of providers to meaningfully care for the HIV<pathogen> population. The next steps include enhanced coordination of trainees ' schedule , improved EPAs documentation , evaluation of trainees in HIV<pathogen> and non-HIV competence beyond residency , and monitor graduates career trajectory.
