  The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA) allows for the exchange of de-identified patient data , but its definition of de-identification is essentially open-ended , thus leaving the onus on dataset providers to ensure patient privacy. The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network ( PCORnet) builds a de-identification approach into queries , but we have noticed various subtle problems with this approach. We censor aggregate counts below a threshold ( i.e. < 11) to protect patient privacy. However , we have found that thresholded numbers can at times be inferred , and some key numbers are not thresholded at all. Furthermore , PCORnet 's approach of thresholding low counts introduces a selection bias which slants the data towards larger health care sites and their corresponding demographics. We propose a solution: instead of censoring low counts , introduce Gaussian noise to all aggregate counts. We describe this approach and the freely available tools we created for this purpose.
