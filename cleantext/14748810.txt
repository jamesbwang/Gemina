  A large number of hospital admissions are attributed to adverse drug reactions ( ADRs) and they are the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. The present study aimed to assess the causality and preventability of adverse drug events ( ADEs) of antibiotics among inpatients having different lengths of hospital stay. A prospective , observational study was conducted in four tertiary-care public sector hospitals of Lahore , Pakistan. Study population consisted of hospitalized patients who were prescribed one or more antibiotics. Data were collected between 1st January , 2017 and 30th June , 2017 from 1249 patients. Naranjo score , modified Schumock and Thornton scale were used for causality and preventability assessments , respectively. Medication errors ( MEs) were assessed by MEs tracking form. SPSS and Microsoft Excel were used for data analysis. A total of 2686 antibiotics were prescribed to 1249 patients and 486 ADEs were found. The preventability assessment revealed that most of the ADEs ( 78.8 %) were found among patients having long length of stay ( LOS) in hospital and were preventable ( 59.3 % of the ADEs were definitely preventable while 44.7 % were probably preventable) and caused by MEs including wrong drug ( 40.1 %) and monitoring errors ( 25 %). The errors were caused due to non-adherence of policies ( 38.4 %) and lack of information about antibiotics ( 32 %). Most of the non-preventable ADEs or ADRs among patients having long and short LOS in hospital were `` probable '' ( 35.5 %) and `` possible '' ( 35.8 %) , respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that ADEs were significantly less among females ( OR = 0.047 , 95 % CI = 0.018 ─ 0.121 , p-value = < 0.001) , patients aged 18 ─ 52 years ( OR = 0.041 , 95 % CI = 0.013 ─ 0.130 , p-value = < 0.001) , patients with ARTIs ( OR = 0.004 , 95 % CI = 0.01-0.019 , p-value = < 0.001) , patients prescribed with 2 antibiotics per prescription ( OR = 0.455 , 95 % CI = 0.319 ─ 0.650 , p-value = < 0.001) and patients with long LOS ( OR = 14.825 , 95 % CI = 11.198 ─ 19.627 , p-value = < 0.001). Antibiotics associated definitely preventable ADEs were more commonly found in patients having long LOS in the inpatient departments because of MEs and lack of proper pharmacovigilance system. The ADRs showed a probable and possible causal association with both β-lactams and non β-lactams antibiotics.
