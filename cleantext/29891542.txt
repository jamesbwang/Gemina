  Urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( UTIs<disease>) are among the most common infections worldwide. Diagnosing UTIs<disease> in older adults poses a significant challenge as asymptomatic colonization is common. Identification of a non-invasive profile that predicts likelihood of progressing from urine colonization to severe disease would provide a significant advantage in clinical practice. We monitored colonization susceptibility , disease severity , and immune response to two uropathogens in two mouse strains across three age groups to identify predictors of infection outcome.
