  Qualitative analysis of the influence of a certain exposure parameter is commonly performed in bioelectromagnetic studies. However , since the exposure condition requires the control of multiple parameters , the diverse results caused by different combinations of these parameters requires further quantitative study of the multivariable ( exposure parameters)- bioeffect relation to identify the rule describing bioelectromagnetic effects. The present work investigated the relation between cell viability and the three main exposure parameters ( electric intensity ( E
