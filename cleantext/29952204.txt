  Concerns regarding the impact of neonicotinoid exposure on bee populations recently led to an EU-wide moratorium on the use of certain neonicotinoids on flowering crops. Currently evidence regarding the impact , if any , the moratorium has had on bees ' exposure is limited. We sampled pollen and nectar from bumblebee colonies in rural and peri-urban habitats in three UK regions; Stirlingshire , Hertfordshire and Sussex. Colonies were sampled over three years; prior to the ban ( 2013) , during the initial implementation when some seed-treated winter-sown oilseed rape was still grown ( 2014) , and following the ban ( 2015). To compare species-level differences , in 2014 only , honeybee colonies in rural habitats were also sampled. Over half of all samples were found to be contaminated ( n = 408) , with thiamethoxam being the compound detected at the highest concentrations in honeybee- ( up to 2.29 ng/g in nectar in 2014 , median ≤ 0.1 ng/g , n = 79) and bumblebee-collected pollen and nectar ( up to 38.77 ng/g in pollen in 2013 , median ≤ 0.12 ng/g , n = 76). Honeybees were exposed to higher concentrations of neonicotinoids than bumblebees in 2014. While neonicotinoid exposure for rural bumblebees declined post-ban ( 2015) , suggesting a positive impact of the moratorium , the risk of neonicotinoid exposure for bumblebees in peri-urban habitats remained largely the same between 2013 and 2015.
