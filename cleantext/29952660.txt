  The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of using a sucrose gradient-based warming protocol as a universal warming approach on human cleavage stage embryos. Between January 2013 and November 2014 , a total of 118 warming cycles were performed on 705 embryos which had previously been cryopreserved/thawed by slow freezing protocols or cryopreserved by slow freezing and warmed by vitrification thaw solution. Clinical outcomes have been retrospectively analyzed depending on cryopreservation and warming techniques used , embryo viability , day of cryopreservation , clinical pregnancy , implantation , and live birth rate. Results indicate that , the use of the vitrification warming protocol for warming after slow freezing results in comparable post-warming survival ( 71.6 % and 71.1 %; p = 0.890). Higher clinical pregnancy , implantation , and live birth rates were obtained in the cryopreserved embryos by slow freezing and warmed by vitrification group in comparison to the cryopreserved/thawed by slow freezing protocols group but the results did not show statistically significant differences between groups ( p > 0.05). These results indicate that such an approach can eliminate the need to search for a brand-dependent product , as well as case-dependent hands-on planning. Further research that evaluates the effectiveness of this approach on a larger case series is underway.
