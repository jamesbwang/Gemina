  LiverMultiScan is an emerging diagnostic tool using multiparametric MRI to quantify liver disease. In a two-centre prospective validation study , 161 consecutive adult patients who had clinically-indicated liver biopsies underwent contemporaneous non-contrast multiparametric MRI at 3.0 tesla ( proton density fat fraction ( PDFF) , T1 and T2 * mapping) , transient elastography ( TE) and Enhanced Liver Fibrosis<disease> ( ELF) test. Non-invasive liver tests were correlated with gold standard histothological measures. Reproducibility of LiverMultiScan was investigated in 22 healthy volunteers. Iron-corrected T1 ( cT1) , TE , and ELF demonstrated a positive correlation with hepatic collagen proportionate area ( all p < 0 Â· 001). TE was superior to ELF and cT1 for predicting fibrosis<disease> stage. cT1 maintained good predictive accuracy for diagnosing significant fibrosis<disease> in cases with indeterminate ELF , but not for cases with indeterminate TE values. PDFF had high predictive accuracy for individual steatosis grades , with AUROCs ranging from 0.90-0.94. T2 * mapping diagnosed iron accumulation with AUROC of 0.79 ( 95 % CI: 0.67-0.92) and negative predictive value of 96 %. LiverMultiScan showed excellent test/re-test reliability ( coefficients of variation ranging from 1.4 % to 2.8 % for cT1). Overall failure rates for LiverMultiScan , ELF and TE were 4.3 % , 1.9 % and 15 % , respectively. LiverMultiScan is an emerging point-of-care diagnostic tool that is comparable with the established non-invasive tests for assessment of liver fibrosis<disease> , whilst at the same time offering a superior technical success rate and contemporaneous measurement of liver steatosis and iron accumulation.
