  Anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> are the most prevalent mental health pathologies among women with breast cancer. Social , clinical and contextual variables may influence emotional stress among women with breast cancer. The aim of this work is to study anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> in a cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2003 and 2013 in Barcelona. We evaluate social and clinical determinants. We performed a mixed cohort study ( prospective and retrospective) using a convenience sample of women diagnosed with breast cancer. The information sources were the Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> questionnaire and hospital medical records. Dependent variables were anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> independent variables were social class , age , employment status , tumour stage at diagnosis , time since diagnosis , social network and social support. We performed a descriptive analysis , a bivariate analysis , and a multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 1086 ( 48.6 %) women had some degree of anxiety-related problem. As for depression<symptom> In the case of depression<symptom> , 225 ( 15 %) women had some degree of depression-related problem. Low emotional support and social isolation were clear risk factors for having more anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> Low social class was also a risk factor , and age also played a role. Our results show that women long period of cancer survival have high prevalences of anxiety<symptom> than depression<symptom> , and this prevalence of anxiety<symptom> is higher than the general population. In addition , we found inequalities between social classes and the isolation and social support are worse too in low social class.
