  Nanocarrier-mediated photodynamic therapy ( PDT) , which involves the systemic delivery of photosensitizers ( PSs) into tumor tissue and tumor cells , has emerged as an attractive treatment for cancer. However , insufficient PS release limits intracellular cytotoxic reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation , which has become a major obstacle to improving the PDT therapeutic efficacy. Herein , a novel hyperbranched polyphosphoester ( hbPPE) containing numerous acetal bonds ( S-hbPPE/Ce6) was explored as a chlorin e6 ( Ce6) nanocarrier for PDT. S-hbPPE/Ce6 with a branched topological structure efficiently encapsulated Ce6 and then significantly enhanced its internalization by tumor cells. Subsequently , the endo-/ lysosomal acid microenvironment rapidly cleaved the acetal linkage of S-hbPPE and destroyed the nanostructure of S-hbPPE/Ce6 , resulting in increased Ce6 release and obviously elevated the intracellular ROS generation under illumination. Therefore , treatment with S-hbPPE/Ce6 noticeably enhanced the PDT therapeutic efficacy , indicating that such a pH-sensitive hbPPE nanocarrier has great potential to improve the PDT therapeutic efficacy for cancer therapy.
