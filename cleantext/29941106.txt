  Cancer immunotherapy is a powerful , growing treatment approach to cancer that can be combined with chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and oncosurgery. Modulating the immune system to enhance anticancer response by several strategies has yielded improved cancer survival. Despite this progress , the success rate for immunotherapy has been below expectations due to unpredictable efficacy and off-target side effects from systemic dosing. Nanotechnology offers numerous different materials and targeting properties to overcome many of these challenges in immunotherapy. In this chapter , we review current immunotherapy and its challenges as well as the latest nanotechnology applications in cancer immunotherapy.
