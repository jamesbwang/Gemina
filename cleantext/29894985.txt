  Establishing the internal validity of psychometric instruments is an important research priority , and is especially vital for instruments that are used to collect data to guide public policy decisions. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale ( WEMWBS) is a well-established and widely-used instrument for assessing individual differences in well-being. The current analyses were motivated by concerns that metal wellbeing items that refer to interpersonal relationships ( Items 9 and 12) may operate differently for those in a relationship compared to those not in a relationship. To assess this , the present study used item characteristic curves ( ICC) and ANOVA of residuals to scrutinize the differential item functioning ( DIF) of the 14 WEMWBS items for participant relationship status ( n with partner = 261 , n without partner = 210). Items 5 , 9 , and 12 showed evidence of DIF which impacted group mean differences. Item 5 ( `` energy to spare '') was unexpected , however plausible explanation is discussed. For participants at the same level of mental wellbeing , those in a relationship scored higher on items 9 and 12 than those not in a relationship. This suggests these items are sensitive to non-wellbeing related variance associated with relationship status. Implications and future research directions are discussed.
