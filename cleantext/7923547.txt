  The study performed by Zhou et al. ( World J Surg Oncol 15:104 , 2017) titled `` Clinical and prognostic significance of HIF-1α overexpression in oral squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis '' attempts to highlight hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha as a possible prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC). We would like to underline a few points which may affect such a conclusion. The correlations between HIF-1α expression and tumour size as well as tumour stage are debatable. Further , the subgroup analysis incorporating Australia and Europe into a single subgroup limits the viability of the prognostic analysis of HIF-1α. We also suggest future studies in the same research area to analyse head and neck squamous cell carcinoma instead of OSCC , to ameliorate the limitations encountered by Zhou et al. , due to the scarcity of relevant clinical data and a low number of studies about OSCC.
