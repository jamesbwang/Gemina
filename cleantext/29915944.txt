  To perform a review on the latest evidence related to intrarenal pressures ( IRPs) generated during upper-tract endourology , and present different tools to maintain decreased values , to decrease complication rates. A literature search was performed using PubMed , restricted to original English-written articles , including animal , artificial model and human studies. Different keywords were: percutaneous nephrolithotomy , PCNL , ureteroscopy , URS , RIRS , irrigation flow , irrigation pressure , intrarenal pressure , intrapelvic pressure and renal-pelvic pressure. IRPs reported during retrograde intrarenal surgery ( RIRS) , PCNL , miniPCNL , and microPCNL range 40.8-199.35 , 3-40.8 , 10-45 and 15.37-41.21 cm H Increased IRP values have been reported during RIRS and UASs constitute the most efficient tool for decreasing them. IRPs during mini-PCNL can be decreased utilizing the vacuum-cleaner and purging effects but might remain uncontrolled during micro- and ultra-mini PCNL. Intraluminal pharmacological treatment could play a role in IRP decrease , with isoproterenol being the most studied agent.
