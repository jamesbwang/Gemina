  Leukocyte adhesion and extravasation are maximal near the transition from capillary to post-capillary venule , and are strongly influenced by a confluence of scale-dependent physical effects. Mimicking the scale of physiological vessels using in vitro microfluidic systems allows the capture of these effects on leukocyte adhesion assays , but imposes practical limits on reproducibility and reliable quantification. Here we present a microfluidic platform that provides multiple ( 54-512) technical replicates within a 15-minute sample collection time , coupled with an automated computer vision analysis pipeline that captures leukocyte adhesion probabilities as a function of shear and extensional stresses. We report that in post-capillary channels of physiological scale , efficient leukocyte adhesion requires erythrocytes forcing leukocytes against the wall , a phenomenon that is promoted by the transitional flow in post-capillary venule expansions and dependent on the adhesion molecule ICAM-1.
