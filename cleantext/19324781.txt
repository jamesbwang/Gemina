  Striking faunal turnover across Asia and Australasia , most famously along the eastern edge of the Sunda Shelf or ` Wallace 's Line ' , has been a focus of biogeographic research for over 150 years. Here , we investigate the origins of a highly threatened endemic lizard fauna ( four species) on Christmas Island<disease>. Despite occurring less 350 km south of the Sunda Shelf , this fauna mostly comprises species from clades centred on the more distant regions of Wallacea , the Pacific and Australia ( more than 1000 km east). The three most divergent lineages show Miocene ( approx. 23-5 Ma) divergences from sampled relatives; and have recently become extinct or extinct in the wild , likely owing to the recent introduction of a southeast Asian snake (
