  Previous research has suggested that forgiveness of self and forgiveness of others might function differently over the course of addiction recovery. However , we know little about the longitudinal process of these dimensions of forgiveness for individuals addressing alcohol-use disorders. Increased knowledge would inform the content and sequencing of intervention strategies. Three hundred and sixty-four individuals managing alcohol dependence participated in a 30-month longitudinal study , reporting their capacity to forgive self and to forgive others every 6 months. Findings indicated that a) participants were more forgiving of others than themselves , b) both types of forgiveness increased over time , c) forgiveness of self increased more rapidly than forgiveness of others , and d) while increases in both types of forgiveness predicted increases in the other type , the effect of forgiveness of others on forgiveness of self was twice as strong as the reverse effect. Implications for facilitating forgiveness in treatment are discussed.
