  The purpose of this integrative review was to synthesize the existing evidence on diabetes care within a Patient-Centered Medical Home ( PCMH) model to evaluate its effectiveness on quality outcomes. Literature published in English between 2005 and 2015 was searched using thefollowing keywords: PCMH and diabetes , comprehensive care , care coordination , patient-centered care , quality and safety , and accessible care. The following databases were searched: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL) , PubMed , Cochrane Review , Academic Premier ( EBSCO) , and Psych INFO. The search yielded 96 articles; 11 were selectedfor review. The effects of the PCMH model on diabetes outcomes varied. The heterogeneity of the research designs , practice settings , and quality outcomes limited the generalizability of the findings. The evidence related to diabetes type 2 quality outcomes in a PCMH model is limited yet encouraging. However , future studies should consider longitudinal designs , where outcomes can be observed over a period of time.
