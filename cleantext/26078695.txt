  Different histo-pathological types and treatment response patterns of Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome<disease> ( INS) have been associated with differences in ethnicity and geographical location. To provide an update on the steroid response and renal histo-pathological pattern in children treated for INS. Medical records of children with INS treated at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital were reviewed. Mean age was 5.3 years Â± 2.8. The majority ( 68.1 %) of the 163 children were of the black racial group. The highest rate of INS was seen in the 2-6 year age group ( 71.2 %). The black racial group had the highest rate ( 42/111; 37.8 %) of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS) , and the white race had the highest rate ( 9/14; 64.3 %) of minimal change disease ( MCD). Ninety four ( 57.7 %) patients were steroid sensitive ( SSNS) while 69 patients ( 42.3 %) were steroid resistant ( SRNS). Minimal change disease was the most common histo-pathological type seen in SSNS ( 60 %) , while FSGS was the most common observed in patients who had SRNS ( 65.2 %). There appears to be a higher rate of FSGS in all the racial groups , and also a higher rate of MCD in the black race group , when compared to previous reports.
