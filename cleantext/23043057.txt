  Retrospective case-control study on the authors ' experience regarding arthroplasty in high congenital dislocations of the hip in adults. Sample with 11 high congenital hip dislocations ( Hartofilakidis type C) that occurred in seven patients , who were submitted to hip arthroplasty by the same surgeon and with the same surgical technique. Mean follow-up period was 4.32 ± 2.67 years ( minimum one year) and all patients were evaluated by the same examiner. All the arthroplasties had cementless fixation , with application of screwed acetabular cups , conical femoral stems , and a metal-polyethylene articular pars. In every patient , shortening femoral osteotomies were performed at subtrochanteric or supracondylar locations. The mean Harris Hip Score at the last evaluation was 88.55 ± 4.50 ( range 81-94). The mean time with high dislocation of the hip ( 42.91 ± 14.59 years , range 19-68) showed a significant inverse correlation with Harris Hip Score ( Despite being a demanding surgery with a reportedly high complication rate , total hip arthroplasty in high congenital dislocations , when properly indicated and technically correctly performed , allows an improvement in function and quality of life.
