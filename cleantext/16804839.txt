  The link of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC) with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) has been established for decades. Although an abnormal high level of EBV sero-antibody spectrum and cell-free circulating EBV DNA loads were exhibited in NPC patients , oral EBV DNA loads , which are primarily responsible for the EBV transmission , has not been previously studied in NPC patients. We conducted an epidemiological study to measure the oral EBV loads , viral components , and the relationship with the serum antibody titers in a large case-control population ( 968 cases and 1656 controls) and a family-based population ( 91 cases and 165 unaffected family members). EBV DNA loads were detected by quantitative PCR approach targeting the BamHI-W region. Although a large individualized variation existed , we still observed a decreased oral EBV DNA loads in the population of NPC patients compared to that of healthy controls ( ORs were 1.00 , 0.69 , 0.62 , 0.33 classified by the quartiles of viral loads , P
