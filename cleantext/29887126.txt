  In a hyper-connected society , IoT environment , markets are rapidly changing as smartphones penetrate global market. As smartphones are applied to various digital media , development of a novel smart product is required. In this paper , a Smart Product Design-Finite Element Analysis Process ( SPD-FEAP) is developed to adopt fast-changing tends and user requirements that can be visually verified. The user requirements are derived and quantitatively evaluated from Smart Quality Function Deployment ( SQFD) using WebData. Then the usage scenarios are created according to the priority of the functions derived from SQFD. 3D shape analysis by Finite Element Analysis ( FEA) was conducted and printed out through Rapid Prototyping ( RP) technology to identify any possible errors. Thus , a User Customized Smart Keyboard has been developed using SPD-FEAP.
