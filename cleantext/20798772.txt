  The growth of the US geriatric population coupled with the rise in thyroid nodular disease and cancer will result in an increased number of thyroidectomies performed in older adults. We aim to evaluate outcomes after thyroidectomy in older adults as compared with younger adults. A retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2012-2015 categorized thyroidectomy patients into three age groups: 18-64 y , 65-79 y , and ≥ 80 y. Thirty-day perioperative outcomes were analyzed using bivariate χ Our study identified 60,990 patients who underwent thyroidectomy: 47,855 ( 78.4 %) patients between 18 and 64 y old , 11,716 ( 19.2 %) between 65 and 79 y old , and 1419 ( 2.3 %) ≥ 80 y. Compared with younger adults , patients aged ≥ 80 y were 2.67 times more likely to develop a complication ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 2.02-3.53 , P < 0.001) , 1.83 times more likely to be readmitted for any reason ( 95 % CI: 1.40-2.38 , P < 0.001) , 1.54 times more likely to be readmitted for a reason related to the thyroidectomy ( 95 % CI: 1.10-2.16 , P < 0.05) , and 1.66 times more likely to have an extended hospital stay ( 95 % CI: 1.44-1.91 , P < 0.001). Patients aged 65-79 y were 1.40 times more likely to develop a complication ( 95 % CI: 1.19-1.63 , P < 0.001). Patients aged ≥ 65 y have significantly higher rates of overall complications. In addition , patients aged ≥ 80 y have higher rates of total and thyroidectomy-related readmissions and extended length of hospital stay.
