  Excellent PEC efficiency , good reusability and the super stability of trap-like SnS2/TiO2 nanotube arrays ( NTs)- based photoanodes are reported. Specifically , the SnS2/TiO2 -180 °C ( ST-180) photoanode exhibited the highest photocurrent density ( 1.05 mA cm-2) and an optimal η ( 0.73 %) at 0.5 V ( vs. SCE) under simulated light irradiation ( AM 1.5 G) , which are 4.6 and 3.8 times higher than those of pure TiO2 NTs ( 0.23 mA cm-2 and 0.19 %). The IPCE values of ST-180 can reach 21.5 % ( 365 nm) and 13.8 % ( 420 nm) , which are much higher than those of pure TiO2 NTs ( 10.6 % at 365 nm and 0.8 % at 420 nm). The APCE values of the pure TiO2 NTs photoelectrode are 12.8 % ( 365 nm) and 1.1 % ( 420 nm) , while the ST-180 values are 22.3 % and 14.2 % , respectively. Furthermore , the generation rates of H2 and O2 for the ST-180 photoanode are 47.2 and 23.1 μmol cm-2 h-1 at 0.5 V under AM 1.5 G , corresponding to faradaic efficiencies of around 80.1 % and 78.3 % , respectively. In short , the high-efficiency PEC water splitting performance of this SnS2/TiO2 photoanode results from the enhanced light harvesting ability of the trap-like SnS2 structure , accelerated carrier transportation properties of TiO2 NTs , and effective carrier separation of the type-II heterojunction structure. This work may offer a combinatorial strategy for the preparation of heterojunction structures with high PEC performance and can be a model structure for similar photoanode materials.
