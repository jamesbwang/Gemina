  To test the effect of docosahexanoic acid ( DHA) dietary supplementation on macular function in patients with Stargardt disease. A single center , double-masked , randomized placebo-controlled trial of 11 subjects ( 2 males , 9 females) with Stargardt disease in a crossover design ( NCT00060749). Six participants were randomized to two sequences of three month periods of DHA supplementation ( 2000 mg/day) followed by three months of placebo. Five participants were randomized to the opposite sequence. All participants were evaluated with a food frequency and NEI-VF25 questionnaires , complete ophthalmic examination , multifocal electroretinography ( ERG , primary outcome) , 30-Hz flicker ERG , Humphrey 10-2 visual field , D15 color tests and serum lipid analysis. During periods of DHA supplementation , serum rose and then fell with transition to periods of placebo. None of the participants experienced greater than 20 % change from baseline values of the mfERG during periods of DHA supplementation or placebo , while the average change in peak amplitude and phase angle of the flicker ERG remained similar at all visits. No significant change was observed for any of the secondary outcome measures. Eight adverse events occurred but these were not considered to be due to the treatment. No perceived effect of DHA supplementation on macular function was observed in a small sample of Stargardt patients who were compliant with the protocol as estimated by changes in serum DHA. This study will help design future studies of the effect of DHA supplementation on retinal function in cohorts with retinal dystrophies.
