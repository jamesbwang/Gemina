  We investigated the predictive role for serum free light chain ratio ( FLCr) ≥ 100 , bone<disease> marrow plasma cell ( BMPC) ≥ 60 % , and evolving biomarkers through group-based trajectory modeling ( GBTM) as high-risk defining events in 273 smoldering multiple myeloma ( SMM) patients with a median follow-up of 74 months. FLCr ≥ 100 was confirmed as a marker for high-risk progression with a median time to progression ( TTP) of 40 months with a 44 % risk of progression of disease ( PD) at 2 years; however , 44 % of FLCr ≥ 100 also did not progress during follow-up. For patients with BMPC ≥ 60 % by core biopsy , the median TTP was 31 months with a 2-year PD of 41 %. GBTM established high-risk trajectories for evolving hemoglobin ( eHb; characterized as a 1.57 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin) , evolving m-protein ( eMP; 64 % increase in m-protein) , and evolving differences in FLC ( edFLC; 169 % increase in dFLC) within 1 year of diagnosis associated with a decreased median TTP and an increased 2 year rate of PD. Of all the variables examined , we identify a model where immunoparesis , eHb , eMP , and edFLC were significant predictors for ultra-high-risk progression with a median TTP of only 13 months with 3 or more variables present. Our results not only confirm a more modest 2 year PD associated with FLCr ≥ 100 and BMPC ≥ 60 but also suggest that eHb , eMP , and edFLC may help identify an ultra-high-risk SMM group.
