  In an effort to minimize backside polyethylene wear and osteolysis associated with titanium tibial baseplates , many manufacturers have transitioned to cobalt chromium alloys. Recent literature has implicated thicker cobalt chromium designs as a potential source of increased stress shielding and resorption. We report the incidence of proximal tibial bone resorption in a large consecutive series of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty , with a modern total knee design. Four hundred thirty-two consecutive primary total knee arthroplasties , performed by 2 fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons were identified over a 24-month period. In addition to review of the medical records , analysis of preoperative and postoperative radiographs was performed. Utilizing a novel classification system , the severity of resorption was quantified and correlated with patient and implant characteristics. After exclusions , 339 knees were evaluated in 292 patients. Mean follow-up was 13.2 months ( range 6-41). Resorption was present in 119 knees ( 35.1 %). Average time to diagnosis of bone loss was 6.9 months ( range 2-32) postoperatively. There was a statistically significant difference between resorption and nonresorption groups with regards to gender and preoperative alignment. Most cases were classified as Grade 1. During the study period , 2 patients required revision for aseptic tibial loosening. Our findings suggest that proximal tibial resorption is common with this particular implant , particularly in men and patients with preoperative varus deformity. Although this typically occurs relatively early in postoperative period and in most cases appears to remodel and stabilize , its ultimate clinical significance and effect on implant survivorship remains unclear.
