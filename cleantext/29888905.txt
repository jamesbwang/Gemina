  Cells release vesicles to the surroundings , the extracellular vesicles ( EVs) , which may transmit biomolecules to other cells , and are found in bodily fluids , thus constituting emerging biomarker targets. Many studies on EV nucleic acid , lipid , and protein composition are available; however , detailed characterization of protein glycosylation has been less approached. Here , we describe a strategy for high-resolution quantitative profiling and structure elucidation of N-glycans from EV glycoproteins of three cell lines: human HEK-293 , human glioma H4 and mouse glioma Tu-2449. EVs have been purified from cell supernatants by ultracentrifugation and compared with total cellular membranes<symptom> ( CMs). CMs and EVs have been characterized by immunoblotting using a panel of EV-specific antibodies , electron microscopy , and immunocytochemistry. N-Glycans were released from membrane-derived tryptic glycopeptides with peptide N-glycosidase F , labeled with 2-aminobenzamide and analyzed by normal phase-high-pressure liquid chromatography ( NP-HPLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight ( MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. For the three cell lines , enrichment in complex N-glycans was found in EVs concomitant to a small amount of high mannose glycans , whereas CMs were highly enriched in high mannose glycans. In HEK-293 and H4 EVs , the predominant N-glycan was tetraantennary proximally fucosylated with α2,3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid; HEK-293 EVs also contained the LacdiNAc structure. Mouse Tu-2449 EV profiles were very heterogeneous , with di- , tri- , and tetraantennary proximally fucosylated glycans and the presence of peripheral Galα3Gal structure. The results opened novel perspectives to further investigate the roles of glycans in EVs biological properties and may contribute to the biomarker field in glioma.
