  This study aimed to investigate the effect of low-dose glucocorticoids ( LDGs) on disease activity , bone density , and fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). This was an interim analysis of the RA Registry. Demographic data and clinical characteristics , including fracture risk assessment tool , were collected. 25 ( OH) Vitamin D , bone mineral density ( BMD) , and intact parathyroid hormone were measured at enrollment. The study group were those who took LDGs ( 2.5-7.5 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent dose) , and the others were included as the control group. A total of 425 participants were enrolled , including 85 ( 20 %) in the control group and 340 ( 80 %) in the study group. The demographics and clinical characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Compared with the control group , the LDGs group had a significantly lower vertebral BMD ( L 1-4) ( g/cm
