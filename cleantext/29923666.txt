  Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia ( bvFTD) has been predominantly considered as a frontotemporal cortical disease , with limited direct investigation of frontal-subcortical connections. We aim to characterize the grey and white matter components of frontal-thalamic and frontal-striatal circuits in bvFTD. Twenty-four patients with bvFTD and 24 healthy controls underwent morphological and diffusion imaging. Subcortical structures were manually segmented according to published protocols. Probabilistic pathways were reconstructed separately from the dorsolateral , orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortex to the striatum<pathogen> and thalamus. Patients with bvFTD had smaller cortical and subcortical volumes , lower fractional anisotropy , and higher mean diffusivity metrics , which is consistent with disruptions in frontal-striatal-thalamic pathways. Unexpectedly , regional volumes of the striatum<pathogen> and thalamus connected to the medial prefrontal cortex were significantly larger in bvFTD ( by 135 % in the striatum<pathogen> , p = .032 , and 217 % in the thalamus , p = .004) , despite smaller dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connected regional volumes ( by 67 % in the striatum<pathogen> , p = .002 , and 65 % in the thalamus , p = .020) , and inconsistent changes in orbitofrontal cortex connected regions. These unanticipated findings may represent compensatory or maladaptive remodeling in bvFTD networks. Comparisons are made to other neuropsychiatric disorders suggesting a common mechanism of changes in frontal-subcortical networks; however , longitudinal studies are necessary to test this hypothesis.
