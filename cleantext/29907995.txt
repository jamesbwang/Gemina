  There is an unmet need to prevent cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease development and progression worldwide. Losartan , the first angiotensin receptor blocker , was shown to exert significant cardioprotective and renoprotective effects in the LIFE ( Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension) and RENAAL ( Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM With the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan) trials. Losartan significantly prevented stroke and decreased serum uric acid levels and the rates of new-onset diabetes mellitus and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. The present review discusses the LIFE ( and its subanalyses) and RENAAL trials and the translation of their results to clinical practice. The place of losartan in the current guidelines for hypertension management is also discussed. Losartan still represents an efficacious , safe , and cost-effective therapeutic option in patients with hypertension who have left ventricular hypertrophy. Losartan is a useful antihypertensive agent for stroke prevention and in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , diabetes mellitus , albuminuria , and hyperuricemia.
