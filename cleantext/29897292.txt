  Olfactory receptors ( ORs) are not exclusively expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons; they are also observed outside of the olfactory system in all other human tissues tested to date , including the testis , lung , intestine , skin , heart , and blood. Within these tissues , certain ORs have been determined to be exclusively expressed in only one tissue , whereas other ORs are more widely distributed in many different tissues throughout the human body. For most of the ectopically expressed ORs , limited data are available for their functional roles. They have been shown to be involved in the modulation of cell-cell recognition , migration , proliferation , the apoptotic cycle , exocytosis , and pathfinding processes. Additionally , there is a growing body of evidence that they have the potential to serve as diagnostic and therapeutic tools , as ORs are highly expressed in different cancer tissues. Interestingly , in addition to the canonical signaling pathways activated by ORs in olfactory sensory neurons , alternative pathways have been demonstrated in nonolfactory tissues. In this review , the existing data concerning the expression , as well as the physiological and pathophysiological functions , of ORs outside of the nose are highlighted to provide insights into future lines of research.
