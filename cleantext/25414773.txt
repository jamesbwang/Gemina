  Prostate cancer ( PCa) is one of the most commonly diagnosed urological malignancies. However , there are limited therapies for PCa patients who develop biochemical recurrence after androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT). In the present study , we investigated the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of Î±-Viniferin ( KCV) , an oligostilbene of trimeric resveratrol , against human PCa cells and found that it markedly inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP , DU145 , and PC-3 cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner , and had a strong cytotoxicity in non-androgen-dependent PCa cells. In addition , KCV inhibited AR downstream expression in LNCaP cells , and inhibited activation of GR signaling pathway in DU145 and PC-3. Further investigation indicated that KCV could induce cancer cell apoptosis through AMPK-mediated activation of autophagy , and inhibited GR expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC). These findings suggest that KCV may prove to be a novel and effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of CRPC.
