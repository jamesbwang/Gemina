  In the treatment of serious and symptomatic coronary heart disease ( CHD) , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) is a frequently utilized intervention. In addition , the risk of CHD is strongly associated with the low activity of paraoxonase-1 ( PON1) , whose 3 '- UTR harbors an rs3735590 polymorphism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the rs3735590 polymorphism could be used as a prognosis marker in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) patients undergoing CABG. In addition , the hypothesis , i.e. , the rs3735590 polymorphism may be involved in the regulation of PON1 gene expression via modulating its interaction with miRNAs , was tested in this study. 292 patients diagnosed with COPD and treated with CABG were recruited for this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from clinical samples , and real-time quantitative PCR and Western-blot were used to measure the expression of miR-616 and PON1 in liver cells of different genotypes. 292 COPD patients were divided into three groups according to their genotypes , i.e. , rs3735590: CC ( 212) , TC ( 75) , and TT ( 5) , respectively ( TC and TT were merged in one group of T carriers for statistical analyses). Patients with the CC genotype were associated with a shorter event-free survival time as compared to patients with the T genotypes. In addition , PON1 was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-616 , while experiments with primary cells of different genotypes showed that miR-616 inhibited the expression of PON1 in CC cells. On the contrary , rs3735590 impaired such inhibitory effect of miR-616 in TT cells. The rs3735590 polymorphism of PON1 acts as a prognostic biomarker in COPD patients treated by CABG.
