  LIGHT ( homologous to lymphotoxins , exhibiting inducible expression , and competing with herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus ( HSV) glycoprotein D for herpes<disease> virus entry mediator ( HVEM) , a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes) has been involved in various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. LIGHT induces the expression of interleukin-8 ( IL-8) , which is up-regulated in chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU). To determine circulating soluble LIGHT concentration and its relationship with IL-8 concentration in patients with CSU. Concentrations of LIGHT , IL-8 , and C-reactive protein ( CRP) were determined in plasma or serum of CSU patients by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LIGHT plasma concentration was significantly higher in moderate-severe CSU patients as compared with the healthy subjects , but not with mild CSU patients. There were significant correlations between increased LIGHT and IL-8 concentrations , but not with increased CRP in CSU patients. Enhanced plasma concentrations of soluble LIGHT and its association with IL-8 concentration suggest the role of LIGHT in systemic inflammatory activation in CSU patients. We hypothesize that LIGHT-mediated immune-inflammatory response plays a role in severe phenotypes of the disease.
