  The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 's State Ambulatory Surgery Database includes procedures performed at hospital outpatient surgery departments. We hypothesized that , among US hospitals with an anesthesia department and freestanding outpatient surgical center , the prevalence on hospital campuses ( i.e. , within 250 yards of the main hospital building) would be sufficiently large ( e.g. , > 10 %) to influence interpretation of observational studies performed with US national ambulatory surgery datasets. Randomly selected Medicare certified hospitals in the USA surveyed during a two-week period in February 2017. Observational cohort study of 500 unique hospitals. Freestanding surgery centers were obtained from a review of the websites of the hospitals. Google map street view was used to measure linear distances of the closest hospital-affiliated ambulatory surgery center with anesthesia provider ( s) to each hospital 's main building. There were 124 hospitals with the website listing an affiliated ambulatory surgery center within 10 miles of the main campus. Of the 124 facilities , 53 were freestanding. Of the 53 , there were 22 ( 42 %) located within 250 yards , 95 % confidence interval 29.1 % to 55.9 % , P < 0.0001 versus 10 %. The percentage of freestanding surgery centers located within 250 yards of main hospital buildings is sufficiently large to influence analyses. When using US national data , ambulatory surgery reported as performed at a hospital should not be considered as having been performed within the hospital. Similarly , hospital affiliated freestanding surgery centers should not be assumed to be more than a 5 min walk for anesthesia and operating room personnel from the hospital.
