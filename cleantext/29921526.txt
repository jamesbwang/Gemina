  To report results of renal denervation ( RDN) with the first catheter-based , non-balloon occlusion ultrasonic system in patients with resistant hypertension. In a multicenter , single-arm trial , 39 patients with resistant hypertension ( defined as uncontrolled hypertension while taking ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications) were treated. The cohort consisted of 4 groups: severe resistant hypertension ( office systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( OSBP) ≥ 160 mm Hg) treated with a unidirectional catheter ( group 1; n = 14); severe resistant hypertension treated with a multidirectional catheter ( group 2; n = 18); moderate resistant hypertension ( OSBP 140-159 mm Hg) treated with a multidirectional catheter ( group 3; n = 5); and recurrent severe resistant hypertension , after an initial response to RF RDN ( group 4; n = 2). Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> monitoring was performed for 6 months. Severe adverse events were not noted immediately after the procedure or during follow-up. Treatment time was longer with unidirectional than with multidirectional catheters ( 36.7 min ± 9.6 vs 11.9 min ± 5.8; P < .001). Mean reductions in office blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( systolic/diastolic) at 1 , 3 , and 6 months were -26.1/ -9.6 mm Hg , -28.0/ -9.9 mm Hg , and -30.6/ -14.1 mm Hg ( P < .01 for all). Per-group analysis showed significant OSBP reduction for groups 1 and 2. Patients with isolated systolic hypertension had a significantly smaller reduction in OSBP after 6 months compared with patients with combined systolic/diastolic hypertension ( -16.2 mm Hg ± 18.5 vs -9.9 mm Hg ± 33.4; P < .005). Use of the RDN system was feasible and safe in this phase I study. Significant blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> reductions were observed over 6 months , although less in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.
