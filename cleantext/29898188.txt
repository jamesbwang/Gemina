  While it has been shown that disordered gamblers with psychosis are at increased risk for comorbid psychopathology , it is unclear whether this dual-diagnosis population is also at greater risk of problematic engagement with comorbid addictive behaviors. We tested for association between disordered gambling with psychosis and comorbid addictive behaviors in a sample of 349 treatment-seeking disordered gamblers. Twenty-five ( 7.2 %) disordered gamblers met criteria for psychosis. Disordered gamblers with psychosis were no more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for current alcohol/substance use disorder than disordered gamblers without psychosis. However , this dual-disorder population reported greater misuse of shopping , food bingeing , caffeine , and prescription drugs. When controlling for multiple comparisons , binge eating was the only addictive behavior to remain significant. Given these findings , a comprehensive assessment of addictive behaviors- specifically food bingeing- in this population may be warranted.
