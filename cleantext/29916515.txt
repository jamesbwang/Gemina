  The synthesis of ketoiminato copper ( ii) complexes ( Cu ( OCRCHC ( CH3) NCH2CH2X) ( μ-OAc)) 2 ( X = NMe2: 4a , R = Me; 4b , R = Ph. X = OMe: 5 , R = Me) and ( Cu ( OCRCHCMeNCH2CH2NEt2) ( OAc)) ( 6 , R = Me) from RC ( O) CHC ( CH3) N ( H) CH2CH2X ( X = NMe2: 1a , R = Me; 1b , R = Ph. X = NEt2: 1c , R = Me. X = OMe: 2 , R = Me) and ( Cu ( OAc) 2 · H2O) ( 3) is reported. The molecular solid-state structures of 4-6 were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies , showing that 4a , b and 5 are dimers which are set up by two ( ( Cu ( μ-OAc) L)) ( L = ketoiminato ligand) units featuring a square-planar Cu2O2 core with a distorted square-pyramidal geometry at Cu ( ii). In contrast , 6 is monomeric with a tridentate-coordinated OCMeCHCMeNCH2CH2NEt2 ligand and a σ-bonded acetate group , thus inducing a square-planar environment around Cu ( ii). The thermal behavior of all complexes was studied by TG ( Thermogravimetry) and DSC ( Differential Scanning Calorimetry) under an atmosphere of Ar and O2. Complex 4b shows the highest first onset temperature at 213 °C ( under O2) and 239 °C ( Ar). PXRD studies confirmed the formation of CuO under an atmosphere of O2 and Cu/Cu2O under Ar. TG-MS studies , exemplarily carried out with 4a , indicate the elimination of the ketoiminato ligands with detectable fragments such as m/z = 15 , 28 , 43 , 44 , 45 , and 60 at a temperature above 250 °C. Vapor pressure measurements displayed that 5 shows the highest volatility of 3.6 mbar at 70 °C ( for comparison , 4a , 1.4; 4b , 1.3; 6 , 0.4 mbar) and hence 4a and 5 were used as MOCVD precursors for Cu/Cu2O deposition on Si/SiO2 at substrate temperatures of 450 °C and 510 °C. The deposition experiments were carried out under an atmosphere of nitrogen as well as oxygen. The as-obtained layers were characterized by SEM , EDX , XPS , and PXRD , showing that with oxygen as the reactive gas a mixture of metallic copper and copper ( i) oxide without carbon impurities was formed , while under N2 Cu films with 53-68 mol % C contamination were produced. In a deposition experiment using precursor 5 at 510 °C under N2 a pure copper film was obtained.
