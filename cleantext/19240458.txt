  The HIV<pathogen> epidemic in England is largely concentrated among heterosexuals who are predominately black African and men who have sex with men ( MSM). We present for the first time trends in annual HIV<pathogen> incidence for adults attending sexual health clinics , where 80 % of all HIV<pathogen> diagnoses are made. We identified newly diagnosed incident HIV<pathogen> using a recent infection testing algorithm ( RITA) consisting of a biomarker ( AxSYM assay , modified to determine antibody avidity) , epidemiological and clinical information. We estimated HIV<pathogen> incidence using the WHO RITA formula for cross-sectional studies , with HIV<pathogen> testing data from sexual health clinics as the denominator. From 2009 to 2013 , each year , between 9,700 and 26,000 black African heterosexuals ( of between 161,000 and 231,000 heterosexuals overall) were included in analyses. For the same period , annually between 19,000 and 55,000 MSM were included. Estimates of HIV<pathogen> incidence among black Africans increased slightly ( although non-significantly) from 0.15 % ( 95 % C.I. 0.05 % -0.26 %) in 2009 to 0.19 % ( 95 % C.I. 0.04 % -0.34 %) in 2013 and was 4-5-fold higher than among all heterosexuals among which it remained stable between 0.03 % ( 95 % C.I. 0.02 % -0.05 %) and 0.05 % ( 95 % C.I. 0.03 % -0.07 %) over the period. Among MSM incidence was highest and increased ( non-significantly) from 1.24 % ( 95 % C.I 0.96-1.52 %) to 1.46 % ( 95 % C.I 1.23 % -1.70 %) after a peak of 1.52 % ( 95 % C.I 1.30 % -1.75 %) in 2012. These are the first nationwide estimates for trends in HIV<pathogen> incidence among black African and heterosexual populations in England which show black Africans , alongside MSM , remain disproportionately at risk of infection. Although people attending sexual health clinics may not be representative of the general population , nearly half of black Africans and MSM had attended in the previous 5 years. Timely and accurate incidence estimates will be critical in monitoring the impact of the reconfiguration of sexual health services in England , and any prevention programmes such as pre-exposure prophylaxis.
