  Despite the common use of quinones as oxidizing agents in N-heterocyclic carbene ( NHC)- based organocatalysis and transition-metal catalysis , the direct reactivity of quinones with NHCs remains underexplored. In this paper , we report the reactivity of NHCs with common p- and o-quinones , uncovering three unreported reactions involving contractions of the quinone ring that lead to push-pull furanolactone chromophores , NHC fulvalenes , and Î±-acylimidazolium cyclopentenone derivatives. These experiments also provide a rationale for the superior compatibility of tetra- tert-alkylated diphenoquinones in NHC-based oxidative transformations.
