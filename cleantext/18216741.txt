  In this study , we examined whether combining neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC) and/or concurrent chemotherapy ( CC) with intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT) improved survival in patients with stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC). Two hundred forty-two stage II NPC patients were enrolled between May 2008 and April 2014 and received radical IMRT with simultaneous integrated boost technique using 6 MV photons; some patient groups also received chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 2-3 cycles. The median follow-up duration was 69 months for all patients. At the last follow-up , 18 patients had experienced treatment failure; locoregional relapse among the IMRT alone , NAC+IMRT , NAC+CCRT , and CCRT occurred in 3 , 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively; distant metastases in 0 , 0 , 2 and 1 , respectively , and there was a statistically significant difference among four groups ( P = 0.019). The 5-year locoregional relapse-free survival ( LRRFS) , distant metastasis-free survival ( DMFS) , progression-free survival ( PFS) , and overall survival ( OS) rates for all patients were 94.7 % , 98.7 % , 92.9 % , and 93.4 % , respectively. Five-year LRRFS , DMFS , PFS , and OS were similar among the IMRT alone , NAC+IMRT , NAC+CCRT , and CCRT treatment groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that a combined regimen was not an independent prognostic factor for any survival outcome. However , patients who received IMRT plus chemotherapy experienced more acute adverse events than those who received IMRT alone. Thus , the addition of NAC and/or CC to IMRT did not improve survival outcomes , but was associated with higher incidences of acute treatment-associated toxicities than IMRT alone in patients with stage II NPC.
