  Integration of graphene into electronic circuits through its joining with conventional metal electrodes ( i.e. , gold) appears to be one of the main technological challenges nowadays. To gain insight into this junction , we have studied the physicochemical interactions between SiC-supported graphene and a drop of molten gold. Using appropriate high-temperature experimental conditions , we perform wetting experiments and determine contact angles for gold drops supported on graphene epitaxially grown on 4H-SiC. The properties of the metal/graphene interface are analyzed using a wide variety of characterization techniques , along with computational simulations based on density functional theory. In contrast with the established literature , our outcomes clearly show that graphene is translucent in the gold/graphene/SiC interface , and therefore its integration into electronic circuits primarily depends on the right choice of the support to produce favorable wetting interactions with liquid gold.
