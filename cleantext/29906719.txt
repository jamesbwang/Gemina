  Behavioral activation ( BA) is receiving renewed interest as a stand-alone or as a component of cognitive-behavior therapy ( CBT) for depression<symptom> However , few studies have examined which aspects of BA are most contributory to its efficacy. This is a secondary analysis of a 9-week randomized controlled trial of smartphone CBT for patients with major depression<symptom>. Depression<symptom> severity was measured at baseline and at end of treatment by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. All aspects of behavioral activation tasks that the participants had engaged in , including their expected mastery and pleasure and obtained mastery and pleasure , were recorded in the web server. We examined their contribution to improvement in depression<symptom> as simple correlations and in stepwise multivariable linear regression. Among the 78 patients who completed at least one behavioral experiment , all aspects of expected or achieved mastery or pleasure correlated with change in depression<symptom> severity. Discrepancy between the expectation and achievement , representing unexpected gain in mastery or pleasure , was not correlated. In stepwise regression , expected mastery and pleasure , especially the maximum level of the latter , emerged as the strongest contributing factors. The study is observational and can not deduce cause-effect relationships. It may be the expected and continued sense of pleasure in planning activities that are most meaningful and rewarding to individuals , and not the simple level or amount of obtained pleasure , that contributes to the efficacy of BA.
