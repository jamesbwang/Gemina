  Cylindrospermopsin ( CYN) is a cyanotoxin that is of particular concern for its potential toxicity to human and animal health and ecological consequences due to contamination of drinking water. The increasing emergence of CYN around the world has led to urgent development of rapid and high-throughput methods for its detection in water. In this study , a highly sensitive monoclonal antibody N8 was produced and characterized for CYN detection through the development of a direct competitive time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay ( TRFIA). The newly developed TRFIA exhibited a typical sigmoidal response for CYN at concentrations of 0.01 ‚Åª 100 ng mL
