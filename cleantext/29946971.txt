  Investigation of the development of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction is important for improving current surgical treatment of ACL injuries to prevent long-term knee joint degeneration. This pilot study examined the relationship between the changes in weight-bearing knee contact kinematics 6 months after ACL reconstruction and the biochemical composition changes in the knee cartilage measured using T2 relaxation values 3 years after the surgery in seven patients. The analysis indicated that the change of the knee contact kinematics in short-term after ACL reconstruction is associated with an increase of T2 values of the cartilage in longer follow up times. The data of this study could provide preliminary data to power future studies that use prospective , longitudinal research and large patient populations to establish prognostic biomechanical markers for determination of long-term cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction.
