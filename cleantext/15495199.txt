  Testosterone treatment of men with low testosterone is common and , although relatively short-term , has raised concern regarding an increased risk of prostate cancer ( CaP). We investigated the association between modest-duration testosterone treatment and incident aggressive CaP. Retrospective inception cohort study of male Veterans aged 40 to 89 years with a laboratory-defined low testosterone measurement from 2002 to 2011 and recent prostate specific antigen ( PSA) testing; excluding those with recent testosterone treatment , prostate or breast cancer , high PSA or prior prostate biopsy. Histologically-confirmed incident aggressive prostate cancer or any prostate cancer were the primary and secondary outcomes , respectively. Of the 147,593 men included , 58,617 were treated with testosterone. 313 aggressive CaPs were diagnosed , 190 among untreated men ( incidence rate ( IR) 0.57 per 1000 person years , 95 % CI 0.49-0.65) and 123 among treated men ( IR 0.58 per 1000 person years; 95 % CI 0.48-0.69). After adjusting for age , race , hospitalization during year prior to cohort entry , geography , BMI , medical comorbidities , repeated testosterone and PSA testing , testosterone treatment was not associated with incident aggressive CaP ( HR 0.89; 95 % CI 0.70-1.13) or any CaP ( HR 0.90; 95 % CI 0.81-1.01). No association between cumulative testosterone dose or formulation and CaP was observed. Among men with low testosterone levels and normal PSA , testosterone treatment was not associated with an increased risk of aggressive or any CaP. The clinical risks and benefits of testosterone treatment can only be fully addressed by large , longer-term randomized controlled trials.
