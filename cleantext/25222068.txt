  Focused ultrasound ( FUS)- mediated blood-brain barrier ( BBB) opening recently entered clinical testing for targeted drug delivery to the brain. Sources of variability exist in the current procedures , motivating the development of real-time monitoring and control techniques to improve treatment safety and efficacy. Here we used three-dimensional ( 3D) transcranial microbubble imaging to calibrate FUS exposure levels for volumetric BBB opening.
