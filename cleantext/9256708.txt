  Surgical wounds<disease> healing by secondary intention ( SWHSI) are increasingly being treated with negative-pressure wound<disease> therapy ( NPWT) despite a lack of high-quality research evidence regarding its clinical and cost-effectiveness. This pilot feasibility RCT aimed to assess the methods for and feasibility of conducting a future definitive RCT of NPWT for the treatment of SWHSI. Eligible consenting adult patients receiving care at the study sites ( 2 acute and 1 community) and with a SWHSI appropriate for NPWT or wound<disease> dressing treatment were randomized 1: 1 centrally to receive NPWT or usual care ( no NPWT). Participants were followed up every 1-2 weeks for 3 months. Feasibility ( recruitment rate , time to intervention delivery) and clinical ( time to wound healing) outcomes were assessed. A total of 248 participants were screened for eligibility; 40 ( 16 Â· 1 per cent) were randomized , 19 to NPWT and 21 to usual care. Twenty-four of the 40 wounds<disease> were located on the foot. Participants received NPWT for a median of 18 ( range 0-72) days. Two participants in the NPWT group never received the intervention and 14 received NPWT within 48 h of randomization. Five participants in the usual care group received NPWT during the study. Ten of the 40 wounds<disease> were deemed to have healed during the study. A full-scale RCT to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of NPWT for SWHSI is feasible. This study identified crucial information on recruitment rates and data collection methods to consider during the design of a definitive RCT.
