  The aims of this study were to ( 1) determine whether an income gradient to overweight and obesity exists in UK adolescents , and ( 2) examine associations between poverty , weight<symptom> status<symptom> , and dietary intake among adolescent girls and boys. Data is from wave six of the UK Millennium Cohort Study. Adolescent height and weight were measured. Body mass index was calculated ( kg/m Â²) and used to classify overweight and obesity. Family income and poverty were determined using equivalised household income. Adjusted logistic and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted. Ten thousand seven hundred thirty-six adolescents ( 5425 boys) had complete data. Adolescents in the lowest income group were at greatest risk of overweight and obesity. Adolescents living in poverty were more likely to be overweight and obese , and reported more frequent consumption of sweetened drinks and fast food and less frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables (
