  To measure the impact of a novel interactive inpatient pediatric pain management solution integrating our hospital 's electronic health record system , the nurse communication phones , and the pharmacy dispensing system , we assessed parent and nurse perspectives on the tool 's potential value , benefits , and challenges. A mixed-methods approach with survey instruments containing closed-ended and open-ended questions was administered to 30 parents and 59 nurses ( 66 % and 23 % response rate respectively). Overall , parents were more satisfied with the interactive technology experience ( 90 %) compared to nurses ( 50 %) with both indicating timely reassessments of pain being the most valuable feature. Qualitative analysis of nurses ' responses yielded 6 themes for technology benefits and 12 for challenges. While patient-interactive technology solutions appear well-received particularly by parent end-users for pediatric hospital pain management , nurse training and interface improvements may result in higher efficacy , ultimately empowering patients/parents , promoting patient engagement and satisfaction.
