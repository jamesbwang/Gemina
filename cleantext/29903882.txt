  Air pollution is growing fastest in monsoon-affected South Asia. During the dry winter monsoon , the fumes disperse toward the Indian Ocean , creating a vast pollution haze , but their fate during the wet summer monsoon has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign , sampling the summer monsoon outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements , supported by model calculations , show that the monsoon sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which contaminants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earth 's surface. However , some pollutants are lofted above the monsoon clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally , including to the stratosphere.
