  Excess intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production is a significant causative factor of many diseases , exemplified by vascular diseases. Mitochondria are a major source of endogenous ROS , which simultaneously induce mitochondrial dysfunction. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2) represents an important intracellular defense system that protects cells against oxidative insults caused by ROS. Therefore , molecules with the capacities of inducing Nrf2 , and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction can inhibit cell apoptosis , and thus are potential drug candidates for the therapy of ROS-mediated vascular diseases. Homoeriodictyol ( HE) , previously isolated from Viscum articulatum Burm , has been found to be an Nrf2 inducer. In the present study , we investigated its protection on ROS-induced endothelial cell injury using a H
