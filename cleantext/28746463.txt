  To analyze the frequency of speech disruptions across different speech tasks , comparing the performance of individuals with Parkinson 's Disease ( PD) and DS. Participants were 20 people with PD , 20 people with DS and 40 fluent individuals. Speech samples were recorded during monologue speech , choral and solo oral reading. Transcriptions of 200 fluent syllables were performed to identify stuttering-like disfluencies ( SLDs) and other disfluencies ( ODs). People with PD presented significantly less speech disruptions when compared to people with DS , but significantly more speech disruptions than the control group. Stuttering-like disfluencies ocurred more frequently during monologue speech and solo oral reading for both PD and DS , whereas the control group did not present difference between these tasks. The stuttering pattern presented by people with PD is different from what is usually described as being neurogenic stuttering.
