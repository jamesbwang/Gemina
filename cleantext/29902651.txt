  The aim of this study was to develop an integrated biofuel ( cellulosic bioethanol) and biochemical ( succinic acid) production process from rapeseed straw after dilute-acid pretreatment. Rapeseed straw pretreatment at 20 % ( w/v) solid loading and subsequent hydrolysis with Cellic ® CTec2 resulted in high glucose yield ( 80 %) and ethanol output ( 122-125 kg of EtOH/Mg of rapeseed straw). Supplementation the enzymatic process with 10 % dosage of endoxylanases ( Cellic ® HTec2) reduced the hydrolysis time required to achieve the maximum glucan conversion by 44-46 % and increased the xylose yield by 10 % compared to the process with Cellic ® CTec2. Significantly higher amounts of succinic acid were produced after fermentation of pretreatment liquor ( 48 kg/Mg of rapeseed straw , succinic acid yield: 60 %) compared to fermentation of xylose-rich residue after ethanol production ( 35-37 kg/Mg of rapeseed straw , succinic yield: 68-71 %). Results obtained in this study clearly proved the biorefinery potential of rapeseed straw.
