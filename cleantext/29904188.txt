  Mapping Review. The objective of this study was to map out and characterize the quantity and quality of all published spinal cord injury ( SCI) randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) with respect to number , sample size , and methodological quality between January 1970 and December 2016. Not applicable. A literature search of multiple research databases was conducted. Studies adhering to the following criteria were included: the research design was an RCT; written in English; participants were > 18 years; and the sample was > 50 % SCI. Data were extracted pertaining to author ( s) , year of publication , country of origin , initial and final sample size , intervention , and control. Methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database ( PEDro) tool. Data was assessed overall and by each year of publication. In total , 466 RCTs were published 1971-2016 on 29 primary topic areas , with Bladder ( n = 78 , 16.7 %) most common , followed by Pain ( n = 54 , 11.6 %) , and Lower<symptom> Limb ( n = 45 , 9.7 %). Studies were published in 172 unique journals , with the most common being Spinal Cord ( n = 68 , 14.6 %). The most common producer of studies was the United States ( n = 191 , 41.0 %). RCT publications increased linearly until 2012 when the rate tripled , resulting in 40.8 % published 2012-2016. A total of 247 ( 59.4 %) RCTs had < 30 subjects; there was no change in sample size over time ( p = 0.770). The overall mean PEDro score was 5.56 ( 1.68); scores improved from 5.0 ( 1.4) in 1976 to 6.3 ( 1.9) in 2016 ( F = 2.230 , p < 0.001). The number of SCI RCTs and their associated sample size remains low; however , methodological quality has improved over time.
