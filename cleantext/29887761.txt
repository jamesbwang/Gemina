  We propose a new steganography method to hide an image into another image using matrix multiplication operations on max-plus algebra. This is especially interesting because the matrix used in encoding or information disguises generally has an inverse , whereas matrix multiplication operations in max-plus algebra do not have an inverse. The advantages of this method are the size of the image that can be hidden into the cover image , larger than the previous method. The proposed method has been tested on many secret images , and the results are satisfactory which have a high level of strength and a high level of security and can be used in various operating systems.
