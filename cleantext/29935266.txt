  Among Apicomplexa protozoa infecting equids , Besnoitia spp. , Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> and Neospora spp. represent important issues from a sanitary and zootechnical viewpoint. However , only scarce epidemiological data are available on the spread of the infections in horses and donkeys in Europe. Therefore , a serosurvey was planned to estimate the prevalence of these Sarcocystidae species in Italian equids. Serum samples from 268 horses and 18 donkeys raised in Italy were collected and serologically analyzed to detect anti-Besnoitia spp. , anti-T. gondii<pathogen> and anti-Neospora spp. antibodies: an approach based on an initial screening by in-house ELISA followed by a confirmatory WB was used. Two horses ( 0.7 %) and four donkeys ( 22.2 %) , showed antibodies anti-Besnoitia spp.. Ten horses ( 3.7 %) resulted positive to T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> and one of these ( 0.4 %) was seropositive also to Neospora spp.. This is the first detection of anti-Besnoitia spp. specific antibodies in Italian horses and donkeys. The study confirmed the circulation of Besnoitia spp. among equids in Europe. Low prevalence of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> and Neospora spp. in horses raised in Italy was reported. Nevertheless , it is noteworthy to consider that consumption of horse meat could represent a source for human
