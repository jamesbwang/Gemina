  Multi-action cisplatin-based mono- ( 1) and di-clofibric acid ( 2) Pt ( iv) `` combo '' derivatives were synthesized via both traditional and microwave assisted procedures. The two complexes offered very good performances ( IC50 values in a nanomolar range) on a panel of human tumor cell lines , including the highly chemoresistant malignant pleural mesothelioma ones. Moreover , both 1 and 2 bypass the cisplatin resistance. Indeed , cisplatin and clofibric acid , the metabolites of the Pt ( iv) → Pt ( ii) intracellular reduction , proved to act synergistically. The adjuvant action of clofibric acid relies on the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α ( PPARα) that , in turn , decreases the level of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α. Both compounds induced extensive apoptosis in tumor cells , also via oxidative stress. Finally , 2 exhibited excellent performances also under the hypoxic conditions typical of solid tumors , where cisplatin is less effective.
