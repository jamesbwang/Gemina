  The present study evaluates the influence of continuous light on phenotypic sex ratios in Chirostoma estor , a temperature sex determination animal model. Relative gene expression levels of 5 day old larvae were performed on two early gonad differentiation genes ( sox9 and foxl2) , two stress axis activation genes ( gcr1 and crf) and four reactive oxygen species ( ROS) antagonist effector genes ( sod2 , ucp2 , gsr and cat). Two light treatments were applied from fertilization; control ( 12L: 12D) simulated natural photoperiod and a continuous illumination photoperiod. By the end of the trial ( 12 weeks after hatching) , differentiated and normal gonads were clearly identifiable in both treatments by histological observations. Regarding sex ratio , 73 % of phenotypic males were found in continuous illumination compared with 40 % in controls. Consistently , the sox9 gene ( involved in early testis differentiation) showed an over expression in 64 % of the individual larvae analysed compared with foxl2 ( ovarian differentiation) suggesting a masculinization tendency in continuous illumination. On the other hand , only 36 % of individuals showed the same tendency in the control treatment consistent with phenotypic sex ratios found under normal culture conditions. Relative gene expression results did not show significant difference in sod2 , ucp2 and gcr1 levels , but cat , gsr and crf showed significantly higher expression levels in the continuous illumination treatment suggesting that both , the stress axis and ROS response mechanisms were activated at this time. This study suggests , a link between continuous light , oxidative stress and environmental sex determination in vertebrates. However , further research is necessary to describe this possible upstream mechanism that may drive some aspects of sexual plasticity in vertebrates.
