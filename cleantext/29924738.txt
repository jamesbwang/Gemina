  Pregnancies in women affected by a muscular dystrophy are at an increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes due to the effect of the disease on the muscular , cardiac and respiratory systems. We sought to evaluate the risk of adverse outcomes within a large population-based cohort study. We used the data extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS) to conduct a retrospective population-based cohort study consisting of over 12 million births that occurred in the United States between 1999 and 2013. Births to mothers with muscular dystrophy were identified using the International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision ( ICD-9) codes and were compared with births to mothers with no maternal muscular dystrophy. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the adjusted effect of muscular dystrophy on maternal and neonatal outcomes. During the 14-year study period , there was an increasing trend in the incidence of muscular dystrophy , with a cumulative incidence of 7.26 in 100,000 births. Women with muscular dystrophy and their neonates were at a significantly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes: specifically , an increased risk of preeclampsia , preterm premature rupture of membranes<symptom> , preterm labor , venous thromboembolism , cardiac dysrhythmia , requiring a blood transfusion and giving birth by cesarean section. Neonates born to affected mothers were at a significantly higher risk of being born preterm , with a congenital malformation and suffering intrauterine growth restriction. The risk of several adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes is increased in pregnant women with muscular dystrophy. As such , additional surveillance in order to mitigate the risk of adverse outcomes is warranted in these pregnancies.
