  The animal model for depressive behavior due to chronic unpredicted mild stress ( CUMS) is commonly used to evaluate antidepressant treatments. The CUMS model has faced some criticism because of the heterogeneity of behavioral effects. Spadin and SID1900 are TREK1 blockers with a quick antidepressant effect. However , to date , their effectiveness and the long-term therapeutic mechanisms are not known. We hypothesize that early intervention with TREK1 blockers can fully reverse depressive-like behaviors , that the chronic administration of TREK1 blockers has a more pronounced effect than the SSRI fluoxetine , and that its long-term therapeutic effects may be mediated by improvement of impaired neurogenesis. Furthermore , we optimized the use of the CUMS model for increased homogeneity by screening the rats after the CUMS induction procedure. Depressive-like behavior was assessed by a forced swimming test , sucrose preference , and open field tests. To evaluate neurogenesis , cell proliferation and newly generated cell apoptosis were measured in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Of 32 rats that underwent the CUMS procedure , 26 rats that exhibited depressive-like behaviors were grouped as CUMS sensitive rats ( CUMSS) , while six that did not were grouped as CUMS resistant ones ( CUMSR). The CUMSR rats exhibited minor neurogenesis impairments , while the CUMSS rats had a more pronounced effect. Treatment with TREK1 blockers could reverse depressive-like behaviors at least 1 week earlier than that of fluoxetine. Chronic administration of both the TREK1 blockers and fluoxetine could restore neurogenesis impairments. This study underlines the importance of model validation by determination of CUMS sensitivity. The TREK1 blockers were found to have an effect that was more rapid and more pronounced than that of fluoxetine. Therapeutic benefits after chronic administration were associated with a restoration of impaired neurogenesis.
