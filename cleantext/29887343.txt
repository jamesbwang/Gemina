  Pernicious anaemia ( PA) is associated with increased gastric cancer risk , but the evidence is conflicting regarding the associated risk of other cancers. To systematically determine the incidence rates of gastro-intestinal cancers other than gastric cancers ( GI-other-than-GC) and non-gastrointestinal cancers ( non-GIC) in PA adults , globally and per tumour site , and the risk associated with PA for GI-other than GC and non-GIC. Studies of PA patients reporting the incidence of GI-other-than-GCs and non-GICs were identified with MEDLINE ( PubMed)- EMBASE ( from first date available to April 2017). A meta-analysis of annual cancer incidence rates was performed. The outcome was the cumulative incidence of GI-other-than-GCs and non-GICs ( ratio between the numbers of new cancer cases identified during the follow-up period and the number of PA patients) and the incidence rate expressed as the rate of events-per-time-unit ( person-years). Of 82,257 PA patients , the pooled incidence rates/100 person-years for non-GCs and non-GICs of 0.27 ( 95 % CI: 0.16-0.42) and 0.23 ( 95 % CI: 0.22-0.25) were calculated by meta-analysis. Compared to the GLOBOCAN data for the general population from the countries of the included studies , the meta-analysis showed an overall relative risk ( RR) of cancer in PA of 0.68 ( 95 % CI: 0.48-0.95). PA patients had a lower RR of colorectal , breast , liver , oesophageal , lung , thyroid , ovary , non-melanoma skin and kidney cancers but had a higher RR of biliary tract cancer ( 1.81:1.21-2.70) , multiple myeloma ( 2.83:1.76-4.55) , Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( 3.0:1.35-6.68) , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( 2.08: 1.58-2.75) , and leukaemia ( 1.56:1.16-2.12). An overall lower RR of cancers-other-than-gastric-cancer in PA patients but an increased RR of biliary tract cancers and haematological malignancies was observed.
