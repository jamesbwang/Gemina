  Notwithstanding the improvement in treatment results for paediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( T-ALL) it remains important to understand if genetic aberrations influence therapy response. PTEN tumour suppressor gene inactivation is a frequent event in T-ALL but its effect on patient therapy response is debatable. We analysed the effect of the presence of mutated PTEN on outcome in 257 children with T-ALL treated with Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica ( AIEOP)- Berlin-Frankfürt-Münster ( BFM) protocols. PTEN mutations were present in 31 ( 12 · 1 %) patients and were significantly associated with increased risk of relapse. PTEN mutations also indicate a poor prognosis in T-ALL patients in the absence of NOTCH1 mutations or in the group of patients with co-presence of PTEN mutation and deletions. These results indicate that PTEN genomic aberrations and the biologically consequential PTEN inactivation contribute to adverse therapy response in T-ALL patients; PTEN status as a biomarker may contribute to the development of new molecularly-defined stratification algorithms.
