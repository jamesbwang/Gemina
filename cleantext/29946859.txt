  Mephedrone ( 4-methylmethcathinone; 4-MMC) is a novel recreational drug similar to methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA) and amphetamine. Several adverse effects have been reported , but little is known about its sub-acute effects. To study sub-acute effects of mephedrone over a period of 9 days. Recreational mephedrone users were recruited and followed over a time period of 9 days. It was recorded whether participants consumed mephedrone or not within the period of testing; those who did were compared to those who did not. Forty-six regular mephedrone users ( 22 males , 24 females) participated , 21 participants voluntarily opted to consume mephedrone 1-3 days after baseline and 25 opted to abstain. Participants were assessed at baseline on a multitude of measures and provided daily reports on cognition , sleep , mood , physical problems , mephedrone cravings and substance use on each subsequent day of the study. The study controlled for psychopathology , sleep , past and current substance use , impulsivity and demographics. Those who consumed mephedrone reported persistent negative mood , physical problems and fatigue<symptom> , compared to those who did not-after controlling for baseline group differences in sleep and subsequent alcohol and cannabis use. The results provide the first prospective evidence of the duration and extent of specific undesirable sub-acute effects of mephedrone in regular recreational users and indicate sub-acute effects of mephedrone on mood , fatigue<symptom> and physical symptoms.
