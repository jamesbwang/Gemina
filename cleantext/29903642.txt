  Chronic non-communicable diseases ( NCDs) are the major reason for death and morbidity worldwide. As many NCDs are initially asymptomatic , online risk calculators with easy and inexpensive access have been developed and validated in order to facilitate early NCD detection and prevention. The aim of this study was to assess the awareness , use and applicability of NCD risk calculators among physicians in private practice in the canton of Bern , Switzerland. This was a cross-sectional cohort study of general practitioners and specialists in general internal medicine and gynaecologists. The questionnaire covered questions on the number of NCD risk calculators known and used , and barriers to their daily use during counselling. Awareness of NCD risk calculators was high. They were considered to be part of a routine preventive `` check-up '' by general internal medicine specialists and general practitioners but not by gynaecologists. AGLA Â® was the most known and used NCD risk calculator. However , 20-30 % of physicians considered themselves non-users , and said they would be so even if access to online NCD risk calculators was made easier. More education on the benefits and better access to the NCD risk calculators are needed.
