  Sex in social amoebae ( or dictyostelids) has a number of striking features. Dictyostelid zygotes do not proliferate but grow to a large size by feeding on other cells of the same species , each zygote ultimately forming a walled structure called a macrocyst. The diploid macrocyst nucleus undergoes meiosis , after which a single meiotic product survives to restart haploid vegetative growth. Meiotic recombination is generally initiated by the Spo11 enzyme , which introduces DNA double-strand breaks. Uniquely , as far as is known among sexual eukaryotes , dictyostelids lack a SPO11 gene. Despite this , recombination occurs at high frequencies during meiosis in dictyostelids , through unknown mechanisms. The molecular processes underlying these events , and the evolutionary drivers that brought them into being , may shed light on the genetic conflicts that occur within and between genomes , and how they can be resolved.
