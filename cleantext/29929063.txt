  The aims of the present study were to determine Yersinia<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> prevalence in finishing pigs and piglets at slaughter and to characterize the isolates in terms of bioserotype , virulence profile , antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic diversity. During the years 2013-2014 , nine pig slaughterhouses placed in Sardinia ( Italy) were visited twice , in order to collect animal samples and scalding water. Overall , 609 samples respectively of tonsils ( 126) , colon content ( 161) , mesenteric lymph nodes ( 161) and carcass surfaces ( 161) were collected from 126 finishing pigs and 35 piglets. Moreover , 18 scalding water samples were collected. Samples were analyzed for the detection of Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> according to ISO 10273-2003 standard ( with some modifications). With regard to finishing pigs , Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> was detected in 11.9 % of colon content samples , 3.2 % of tonsils and 2.4 % of lymph nodes. In piglets , Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> prevalence was 8.6 % in colon content and 2.8 % lymph nodes samples. Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> was not detected from carcass surface samples of both finishing pigs and piglets and from scalding water samples. Isolates were bio- and serotyped , tested for the presence of four virulence genes by PCR ( ail , ystA , ystB and inv) and for antimicrobial resistance by disc-diffusion method. Among 47 confirmed isolates , 33 ( 70.2 %) belonged to bio-serotype 4: O3 , 7 ( 14.9 %) to bio-serotype 2/O: 5 and 7 ( 14.9 %) to bio-serotype 1A. Bio-serotype 1A was detected only in isolates of piglets ' samples. In bio-serotype 4/O: 3 isolates the most common virulence genes were ystA ( 97.0 %) , ail ( 84.8 %) and inv ( 78.8 %). In bio-serotype 2/O: 5 , ail , inv and ystA genes were detected in all of the isolates. All bio-serotype 1A isolates were ystB positive ( lacking ail , inv and ystA). All isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime , ceftazidime , chloramphenicol , ciprofloxacin , enrofloxacin , gentamicin , nalidixic acid , sulphonamide , tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole. Resistances to ampicillin and cefalothin were the most common ( 100 %) , followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid ( 83.0 %) and streptomycin ( 4.3 %). Resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was detected in 57 % of bio-serotype 4/O: 3 isolates , 71 % of bio-serotype 1A and 100 % of bio-serotype 2/O: 5 isolates. Two bio-serotype 4/O: 3 isolates ( 6 %) were resistant to streptomycin. Thirty-two pathogenic Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> isolates were tested by NotI-PFGE , which identified 5 patterns among bio-serotype 4/O: 3 isolates and 2 patterns among bio-serotype 2/O: 5 isolates. This study provides epidemiological data about human pathogenic Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> and highlight the role of pigs as a potential source of infection for the consumers in Sardinia.
