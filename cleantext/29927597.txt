  The N-heterocyclic carbene ( NHC)- catalyzed oxidative C-H deprotonations have attracted increasing attention; however , the general mechanism regarding this kind of oxidative organocatalysis remains unclear. In this paper , the competing mechanisms and origin of the stereoselectivity of the NHC-catalyzed oxidative Î³-C ( sp
