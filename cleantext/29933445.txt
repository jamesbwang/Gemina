  Procedural training is integral to family medicine residencies. Although accreditation bodies require that family medicine residency programs train residents in procedures relevant to their practices , there are no standards defining the scope of family medicine. We compared the perceived importance of 31 procedures by faculty , residents , and recent graduates of one institution. An online survey was sent to current residents and faculty of a large academic family medicine residency , as well as community practitioners who had graduated from that residency within the past 5 years. The survey asked participants to rate how important 31 procedures are for family medicine practices. The overall response rate was 37 %. Most respondents provided outpatient care , and few provided or intended to provide obstetric care. Dermatologic and musculoskeletal procedures were rated as having high importance by all groups , whereas obstetric and inpatient procedures received lower ratings. Residents ascribed higher importance than faculty or recent graduates for nearly all procedures. Most residents , faculty , and community practitioners provided outpatient care and rated dermatologic and musculoskeletal procedures as important. Inpatient and obstetric care are less common career paths , and related procedures were rated as less important. Resident physicians ascribed greater importance than community practitioners for many procedures , which may be due misperceptions of their future practice needs or imposed requirements for graduation.
