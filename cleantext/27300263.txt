  Obesity is characterized by mild chronic inflammation<symptom> that is linked with impaired iron homeostasis. Studies in human and murine show that there is a transgenerational epigenetic inheritance via the gametes in obesity; however , there is little information on changes in the expression of microRNAs related to inflammation<symptom> and iron homeostasis in spermatozoa from obese subjects. The present study investigated the expression of microRNAs related to inflammation<symptom> ( miR-21 y miR-155) and iron nutrition ( miR-122 and miR-200b) in plasma , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) and spermatozoa from normozoospermic controls ( Cn;
