  Dietary guidelines for egg consumption for general population differ among public health agencies. Our aim was to investigate the association between egg intake and both all-cause and specific-cause of mortality in a Mediterranean population. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ( EPIC)- Spain cohort included 40,621 men and women aged 29-69 years old in the nineties from 5 Spanish regions. After a mean of 18 years of follow-up , 3,561 deaths were recorded , of which 1,694 were from cancer , 761 from CVD , and 870 from other causes. Data on egg consumption was collected using a validated diet history at recruitment. Cox proportional hazards models , adjusted for confounders , were used in the analyses. The mean ( standard deviation) egg consumption was 22.0 g/day ( 15.8) and 30.9 g/day ( 23.1) in women and men , respectively. No association was observed between egg consumption and all-cause mortality for the highest vs the lowest quartile ( HR 1.01; 95 % CI 0.91-1.11; P trend = 0.96). Likewise , no association was observed with cancer and cardiovascular diseases mortality. However , an inverse association was found between egg consumption and deaths for other causes ( HR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.63-0.93; P trend = 0.003) , particularly for deaths from the nervous system ( HR 0.59; 95 % CI 0.35-1.00; P trend = 0.036). No interaction was detected with the adherence to Mediterranean diet. This study shows no association between moderate egg consumption , up to 1 egg per day , and main causes of mortality in a large free-living Mediterranean population.
