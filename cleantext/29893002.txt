  Recently plant biologists have documented that plants , like animals , engage in many activities that can be considered as behaviors , although plant biologists currently lack a conceptual framework to understand these processes. Borrowing the well-established framework developed by psychologists , we propose that plant behaviors can be constructively modeled by identifying four distinct components: ( 1) a cue or stimulus that provides information , ( 2) a judgment whereby the plant perceives and processes this informative cue , ( 3) a decision whereby the plant chooses among several options based on their relative costs and benefits , and ( 4) action. Judgment for plants can be determined empirically by monitoring signaling associated with electrical , calcium , or hormonal fluxes. Decision-making can be evaluated empirically by monitoring gene expression or differential allocation of resources. We provide examples of the utility of this judgment and decision-making framework by considering cases in which plants either successfully or unsuccessfully induced resistance against attacking herbivores. Separating judgment from decision-making suggests new analytical paradigms ( i.e. , Bayesian methods for judgment and economic utility models for decision-making). Following this framework , we propose an experimental approach to plant behavior that explicitly manipulates the stimuli provided to plants , uses plants that vary in sensory abilities , and examines how environmental context affects plant responses. The concepts and approaches that follow from the judgment and decision-making framework can shape how we study and understand plant-herbivore interactions , biological invasions , plant responses to climate change , and the susceptibility of plants to evolutionary traps.
