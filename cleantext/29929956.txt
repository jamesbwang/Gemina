  To evaluate clinical , interferon and imaging predictors of progression from ` At Risk ' to autoimmune connective tissue diseases ( AI-CTDs). A prospective observational study was conducted in At-Risk of AI-CTD ( defined as antinuclear antibody ( ANA) positive; ≤ 1 clinical systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) criterion; symptom duration < 12 months and treatment-naïve). Bloods<symptom> and skin biopsy ( non-lesional) were analysed for two interferon-stimulated gene expression scores previously described ( IFN-Score-A and IFN-Score-B). Forty-nine healthy controls ( HCs) and 114 SLE were used as negative and positive controls. Musculoskeletal ultrasound was performed. Progression was defined by meeting classification criteria for AI-CTDs at 12 months. 118 individuals with 12-month follow-up were included. Of these , 19/118 ( 16 %) progressed to AI-CTD ( SLE = 14 , primary Sjogren 's = 5). At baseline , both IFN scores differed among At-Risk , HCs and SLE groups ( p < 0.001) and both were elevated in At-Risk who progressed to AI-CTD at 12 months versus non-progressors , to a greater extent for IFN-Score-B ( fold difference ( 95 % CI) 3.22 ( 1.74 to 5.95) , p < 0.001) than IFN-Score-A ( 2.94 ( 1.14 to 7.54); p = 0.018). Progressors did not have significantly greater baseline clinical characteristics or ultrasound findings. Fold difference between At-Risk and HCs for IFN-Score-A was markedly greater in skin than blood. In multivariable logistic regression , only family history of autoimmune rheumatic disease , OR 8.2 ( 95 % CI 1.58 to 42.53) and IFN-Score-B , 3.79 ( 1.50-9.58) increased the odds of progression. A two-factor interferon score and family history predict progression from ANA positivity to AI-CTD. These interferon scores may allow stratification of individuals At-Risk of AI-CTD permitting early intervention for disease prevention and avoid irreversible organ damage.
