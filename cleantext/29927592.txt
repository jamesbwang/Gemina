  We describe a low cost alternative to the standard variational DMRG ( density matrix renormalization group) algorithm that is analogous to the combination of the selected configuration interaction plus perturbation theory ( SCI+PT). We denote the resulting method p-DMRG ( perturbative DMRG) to distinguish it from the standard variational DMRG. p-DMRG is expected to be useful for systems with very large active spaces , for which variational DMRG becomes too expensive. Similar to SCI+PT , in p-DMRG , a zeroth-order wave function is first obtained by a standard DMRG calculation but with a small bond dimension. Then , the residual correlation is recovered by a second-order perturbative treatment. We discuss the choice of partitioning for perturbation theory , which is crucial for its accuracy and robustness. To circumvent the problem of a large bond dimension in the first-order wave function , we use a sum of matrix product states to expand the first-order wave function , yielding substantial savings in computational cost and memory. We also propose extrapolation schemes to reduce the errors in the zeroth- and first-order wave functions. Numerical results for Cr
