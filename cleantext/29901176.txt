  We recently reported that TPD7 suppressed tumor cell proliferation , and inhibited invasion , through the suppression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ( CXCR4). In the present study , we investigated the anticancer effect of TPD7 on apoptosis and invasion of cervical cancer HeLa cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that TPD7 decreased cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK) 1 and cyclin D1 expression , and increased cyclin A expression , following S phase blockade. TPD7 induced chromatin condensation and significantly elevated the number of apoptotic cells , suggesting that its inhibitory effect on HeLa cells was due to the induction of cell cycle blockade and apoptosis. Mechanistically , TPD7 altered the extrinsic apoptosis pathway by upregulating Fas expression , and the intrinsic pathway by modulating Bcl-2 family proteins , p53 , and NF-ÎºB p65 , leading to enhanced apoptosis. TPD7 inhibited HeLa cell invasion by downregulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -9 and CXCR4 proteins. In vivo experiments revealed that TPD7 inhibited tumor growth in HeLa cell xenografted mice. These findings indicated that TPD7 may be a potential chemoprevention agent for the management of cervical carcinoma.
