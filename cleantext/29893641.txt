  Purpose To determine the impact of patient age on the cost-effectiveness of endovascular therapy ( EVT) in addition to standard care ( SC) in large-vessel-occlusion stroke for patients aged 50 to 100 years in the United States. Materials and Methods A decision-analytic Markov model was used to estimate direct and indirect lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs). Age-dependent input parameters were obtained from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis for age at index stroke were used. The willingness-to-pay ( WTP) was set to thresholds of $ 50 000 , $ 100 000 , and $ 150 000 per QALY. The study applied a U.S. setting for health care and societal perspectives. Incremental costs and effectiveness were derived from deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Acceptability rates at different WTP thresholds were determined. Results EVT+SC was the dominant strategy in patients aged 50 to 79 years. The highest incremental effectiveness ( 2.61 QALYs) and cost-savings ( health care perspective , $ 99 555; societal perspective , $ 146 385) were obtained in 50-year-old patients. In octogenarians ( 80-89 years) , EVT+SC led to incremental QALYs at incremental costs with acceptability rates of more than 85 % , more than 99 % , and more than 99 % at a WTP of $ 50 000 , $ 100 000 , and $ 150 000 per QALY , respectively. In nonagenarians ( 90-99 years) , acceptability rates at a WTP of $ 50 000 per QALY dropped but stayed higher than 85 % and higher than 95 % at thresholds of $ 100 000 and $ 150 000 per QALY. Conclusion Using contemporary willingness-to-pay thresholds in the United States , endovascular therapy in addition to standard care reduces lifetime costs for patients up to 79 years of age and is cost-effective for patients aged 80 to 100 years.
