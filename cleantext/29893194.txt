  Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) is a global major health problem resulting from interaction of environmental and genetic factors , examples of the latter being KCNJ11 ( coding for part of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel) and SDF-1β ( coding for chemokine CXCL12). Our case-control study was conducted to assess whether recessive , dominant or additive genotype model associations of KCNJ11 ( E23K , rs5219) and SDF-1β ( G801A , rs1801157) were more strongly linked to type 2 diabetes. Subjects & Methods Genetic polymorphism analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Alleles and genotype frequencies between 200 cases and 200 controls were determined and compared. Results The dominant ( EE v EK + KK , p = 0.022) and additive ( EK v EE + KK , p = 0.021) models , but not the recessive model ( KK v EE + EK , p = 0.727) of KCNJ11 were linked to diabetes. Similarly , the dominant ( GG v GA + AA , p < 0.001) and additive ( AG v GG + AA , p = < 0.001) models , but not the recessive model ( AA v AG + GG , p = 0.430) of SDF-1β were linked to diabetes. The A allele ( p = 0.006) of SDF-1β was protective against the risk of T2DM. Conclusion Both dominant and additive models in both KCNJ11 ( E23K , rs5219) and SDF-1β ( G801A , rs1801157) genetic polymorphisms are significantly associated with type 2 diabetes.
