  Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D has been associated with unfavorable cardiometabolic risk profiles in many observational studies in children , but very few randomized controlled trials have investigated this. We explored the effect of winter-time cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3) supplementation on cardiometabolic risk markers in young , white , 4- to 8-y-old healthy Danish children ( 55 ° N) as part of the pan-European ODIN project. In the ODIN Junior double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-response trial , 119 children ( mean ± SD age: 6.7 ± 1.5 y; 36 % male; 82 % normal weight) were randomly allocated to 0 , 10 or 20 µg/d of vitamin D3 for 20 wk ( October-March). Cardiometabolic risk markers including BMI-for-age z score ( BMIz) , waist circumference , systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , serum triglycerides and cholesterol ( total , LDL , HDL , and total: HDL) , plasma glucose and insulin , and whole-blood glycated hemoglobin were measured at baseline and endpoint as secondary outcomes together with serum 25 ( OH) D. Intervention effects were evaluated in linear regression models as between-group differences at endpoint adjusted for baseline value of the outcome , and additionally for age , sex , baseline serum 25 ( OH) D , BMIz , time since breakfast , and breakfast content. Mean ± SD serum 25 ( OH) D was 56.7 ± 12.3 nmol/L at baseline and differed between groups at endpoint with concentrations of 31.1 ± 7.5 , 61.8 ± 10.6 , and 75.8 ± 11.5 nmol/L in the 0- , 10- , and 20 µg/d groups , respectively ( P < 0.0001). Vitamin D3 supplementation had no effect on any of the cardiometabolic risk markers in analyses adjusted for baseline value of the outcome ( all P ≥ 0.05) , and additional covariate adjustment did not change the results notably. Preventing the winter decline in serum 25 ( OH) D with daily vitamin D3 supplementation of 10 or 20 µg had no cardiometabolic effects in healthy 4- to 8-y-old Danish children. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02145195.
