  To evaluate the efficacy of low-level laser therapy on median nerve stiffness by using strain elastography in carpal tunnel syndrome<disease> ( CTS). This study included 37 wrists of 34 patients with mild or moderate CTS between January 2016 and August 2016. The control group comprised 17 patients ( 18 wrists) with CTS who were treated with wrist splinting for 3 weeks. The low-level laser therapy group included 17 patients ( 19 wrists) with CTS who were treated with a combination of splinting and low-level laser therapy , which was applied 5 times per week for 3 weeks. Clinical assessment scales , including the Symptom Severity Scale ( SSS) and Functional Status Score ( FSS) , were obtained from our database. The cross-sectional area by ultrasound and strain ratio by elastography were studied. The differences in the strain ratio , cross-sectional area , SSS , and FSS between pretreatment and posttreatment periods in the groups were compared by the paired-sample t test. The correlations between changes in the strain ratio and the cross-sectional area , SSS , and FSS were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficients. The control group included 13 women and 4 men , and the therapy group included 14 women and 3 men. In the therapy group , the mean values of the strain ratio , cross-sectional area , SSS , and FSS decreased significantly after laser therapy ( P < .001) in contrast to the control group. No significant correlation was observed between the decreasing degree of the strain ratio and the cross-sectional area , SSS , and FSS after laser therapy. The strain ratio and cross-sectional area of the median nerve decrease after low-level laser therapy. These changes may be related to the therapeutic effects of low-level laser therapy , such as nerve regeneration and improvement of the vascular supply.
