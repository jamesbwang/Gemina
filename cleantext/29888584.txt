  To analyze studies published in journals included in PubMed in terms of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) examining the therapeutic effect of acupuncture for simple obesity , so as to provide a reference for subsequent RCT-related designs and results. RCT literature about acupuncture treatment of simple obesity from the PubMed database and from 2000 to 2016 was retrieved by using keywords of `` obesity '' `` fat '' `` acupuncture '' `` joint application of acupuncture and herbal medicine '' or `` auricular point '' `` electroacupuncture '' , `` acupoint application '' , or `` cupping '' , followed by screening , extraction and evaluation of the design methodology and outcomes using Consolidated Standards for Reporting of Trials ( CONSORT) and Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture ( STRICTA). Fourteen articles from six countries in Asia examining the therapeutic effect of acupuncture in the treatment of simple obesity mainly by using acupoints of the Stomach Meridian were included. Generally , acupuncture was found to be more effective than sham acupuncture. However , PubMed did not include any RCTs comparing acupuncture with western medicine for weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and many problems ( as details of needling manipulation , etc.) remained in the the research reports available in the database. All the existing RCTs generally affirm the positive efficacy of acupuncture for simple obesity , but high-quality RCTs , particularly those comparing acupuncture with western medicines for weight<symptom> loss<symptom> are lacking.
