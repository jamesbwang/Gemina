  Chemophototherapy is an advanced cancer therapeutic that uses photothermal nanocarriers ( NCs) responsive to near-infrared ( NIR) light. For the past decade , chemophototherapy has been investigated intensively for clinical translation , and continuous-flow production of biofunctional compounds ( NCs , drugs , probes , nanocomposites) has received increasing attention for future therapeutics. However , in situ supply of a stimuli-responsive inorganic core and subsequent tight drug loading on the core are challenging tasks in the practical use of on-demand nanomedicines. Thus , in this study , we designed and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo models of an aero-hydro-aero single-pass production system for chemophotothermally active NCs. We prepare tightly-drug-loadable cores ( titanium peroxide ( yTiO2) nanovesicles ( NVs)) using hydrogen flame pyrolysis of vaporized TiCl4 ( aero) and successive ultrasonic H2O2 treatment ( hydro). The NVs formed were incorporated with graphene oxide ( GO) , doxorubicin ( D) , and polyethylene glycol ( P) in a spray to form GO-yTiO2@DP NCs ( aero). The NVs ' tight DP loading and endothermic effect induced greater , sustained D release and tumor-selective distribution , even for hyperthermic activity. The results showed the route developed may be a stepping stone to scalable , reconfigurable production for on-demand chemophotothermal therapeutics.
