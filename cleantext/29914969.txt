  Ovule formation is a complex developmental process in plants , with a strong impact on the production of seeds. Ovule primordia initiation is controlled by a gene network , including components of the signaling pathways of auxin , brassinosteroids and cytokinins. By contrast , gibberellins ( GAs) and DELLA proteins , the negative regulators of GA signaling , have never been shown to be involved in ovule initiation. Here , we provide molecular and genetic evidence that points to DELLA proteins as novel players in the determination of ovule number in
