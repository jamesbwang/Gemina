  This study aimed to examine the relationships between meteorological factors and the incidence of scarlet fever<disease> in different populations for scientific prevention strategies. An ecological study was conducted. The seasonal index was used to detect the seasonal pattern of scarlet fever<disease> A generalized additive model was conducted to estimate the impact of meteorological factors on scarlet fever<disease> in different age groups in Jiangsu province. Among the 15,873 cases , the vast majority of cases ( 91.84 %) occurred in the population between 3 and 14 years old , with an average annual incidence rate of 14.51 per 100,000 , and 2.81 per 100,000 in the age group ≤ 2 years old. In the generalized additive model , the risk of scarlet fever<disease> increased gradually with the temperature rising in both age groups. Interestingly , with the monthly mean temperature above 20 °C , the risk of scarlet fever<disease> presented a declining trend in those aged 3-14 years , while it kept stable in the age group ≤ 2 years. The temperature range only showed a positive effect in the population aged 3-14 years when it was above 9 °C. This study revealed the different effects of meteorological factors on scarlet fever<disease> in different populations. Surveillance and targeted preventions in the population aged 3-14 years should be enhanced during March-June and November to the following January. Meanwhile , the health education of the guardians was the key to reducing the disease in the age group ≤ 2 years.
