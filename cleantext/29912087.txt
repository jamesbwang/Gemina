  The purpose of this study is to describe pediatric ocular injuries presenting to a level-III pediatric trauma center and emergency department. We performed a retrospective study and identified children from January 1 , 2011 , to January 1 , 2016. Charts were reviewed for any subject , age from newborn to younger than 18 years , based on International Classification of Diseases , ninth and tenth revision , codes for any ocular injury. Data abstraction included age , sex , means of arrival , eye involved , mechanism of injury , type of ocular injury , imaging studies obtained , procedures performed , location of definitive repair ( in the operating room or emergency department) , and subspecialty services involved. In the 5-year period , we describe 356 injuries among 278 children. Males had a slightly higher rate of presentation than females ( 156 and 122 , respectively). Forty-three children ( 15.46 %) required repair in the operating room. Dog bites comprised of 7.19 % children with outpatient follow-up , one patient ( 0.36 %) eventually developed anophthalmia , and 30 children ( 10.79 %) had long-term ophthalmological sequelae ( ie , glaucoma and blindness<symptom>). At our institution , a level-III trauma center , we evaluated and managed approximately 1 ocular injury case per week and children required surgical repair in the operating room at a higher rate than higher-level trauma centers. Injuries secondary to dog bites remain a clinically significant etiology.
