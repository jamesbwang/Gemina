  The antimicrobial peptide pediocin PA-1 is a class IIa bacteriocin that inhibits several clinically relevant pathogens including Listeria<pathogen> spp.. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of whole pediocin PA-1 and novel analogs thereof using a combination of solid- and solution-phase strategies to overcome difficulties due to instability and undesired reactions. Pediocin PA-1 thus synthesized was a potent inhibitor of Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> ( MIC = 6.8 nM) , similar to the bacteriocin produced naturally by Pediococcus<pathogen> acidilactici<pathogen> Of particular interest is that linear analogs lacking both of the disulfide bridges characterizing pediocin PA-1 were as potent. One linear analog was also a strong inhibitor of Clostridium<pathogen> perfringens<pathogen> , another important food-borne pathogen. These results are discussed in light of conformational information derived from circular dichroism , solution NMR spectroscopy and structure-activity relationship studies.
