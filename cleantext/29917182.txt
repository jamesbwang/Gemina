  Pathogenic mechanism of multiple myeloma is still unclear yet. Abnormality in cell autophagy is closely correlated with various orthopedic diseases especially multiple myeloma. Therefore , this study investigated the mechanism of cell autophagy abnormality in multiple myeloma occurrence and clinical implications. Using multiple myeloma cell line H929 as the model , cells were treated with UV irradiation. Western blot was used to measure the autophagy of H929 cell , expression level of autophagy molecules and activation of autophagy signal pathway such as Wnt. Using autophagy activator , H929 cell autophagy was potentiated , followed by quantification of autophagy molecular expression and signal pathway such as Wnt activation. Agonist or antagonist of Wnt signal pathway was used to treat H929 cells followed by measuring autophagy molecules and Wnt pathway activation. The correlation between Wnt signal pathway or cell autophagy and occurrence of multiple myeloma was analyzed. UV irradiation treatment on multiple myeloma cell line H929 induced autophagy and Wnt signal pathway activation. The inhibitor of Wnt signal pathway suppressed UV-induced H929 cell autophagy. However , over-expression of Wnt signal pathway enhanced UV-mediated autophagy of H929 cells. The condition of Wnt activation and autophagy level were positively correlated. UV irradiation can induce autophagy of multiple myeloma cells , suggesting that management of cell autophagy might be one possible treatment for multiple myeloma.
