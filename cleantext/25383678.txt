  Despite significant advances in understanding of the causes of and treatment of myocardial infarction ( MI) in recent years , morbidity and mortality is still high. The aim of this study was to identify miRNA and genes potentially associated with MI. mRNA and miRNA expression datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Interactions between miRNA and the expression and function of target genes were analyzed , and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed. The diagnostic value of identified miRNA and genes was assessed. Quantitative RT-PCR was applied to validate the results of the bioinformatics analysis. MiR-27a , miR-31 * , miR-1291 , miR-139-5p , miR-204 , miR-375 , and target genes including
