  Lenalidomide is associated with increased risk of thromboembolism ( VTE) in patients with multiple myeloma. This risk has not previously been defined in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL) , for which lenalidomide is also an active agent. We conducted a systematic literature search in Ovid MEDLINE ( 1946 to February 2017) , Ovid EMBASE ( 1974 to February 2017) , The Cochrane Library ( Wiley) , and Web of Science Core Collection for prospective studies evaluating lenalidomide-containing regimens in B-cell NHL with adequate reporting of patient characteristics , total cycles received , and safety data including VTE rates. The primary outcome was VTE events per 100 patient-cycles by meta-analysis using random-effects models. Our literature search identified 1719 citations; 28 articles were included. For all patients with B-cell NHL receiving lenalidomide , the rate of VTE per 100 patient-cycles was 0.77 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.48-1.12; I
