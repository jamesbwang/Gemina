  Clinicians providing dialysis care have numerous erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs) available for treating anemia<symptom> We sought to provide a contemporary description of ESA types used in hemodialysis ( HD) settings in nine European countries. Our study uses Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study phase 5 ( 2012-2015) data from nine European countries ( Belgium , France ,- Germany , Italy , Russia , Spain , Sweden , Turkey , and the United Kingdom). A total of 164 facilities and 3,281 patients contributed cross-sectional data. ESA types captured included short-acting epoetins ( e.g. , epoetin alfa , beta , etc. , including biosimilars) , darbepoetin alfa , and continuous erythropoietin receptor agonist ( CERA; methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta). We observed broad variability across countries in prescription of ESA types: prescription of epoetin alfa or epoetin beta ranged from 22 % ( France) to 78 % ( Russia) , darbepoetin alfa prescription ranged from 13 % ( Russia) to 53 % ( UK) , and CERA prescription ranged from < 3 % ( Sweden) to 26 % ( France). Prescription of different ESA types varied substantially within some European countries from 2012-2015 but not across all countries in aggregate. Number of ESA types prescribed by a facility varied from 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 different ESA types in 32 , 40 , 21 , and 8 % of facilities , respectively. No differences were seen in the unadjusted distributions of achieved hemoglobin values by ESA type. A variety of short- and long-acting ESAs are commonly used in European HD facilities to maintain hemoglobin at remarkably similar levels with each ESA type. The availability of numerous ESA options for managing anemia<symptom> has allowed European providers to optimize anemia<symptom> management according to the particular circumstances of each patient.
