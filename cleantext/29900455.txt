  Asymmetrical etching of nanoparticles was achieved by employing interface-confined galvanic replacement reactions. Interfacial Ag nanocubes , nanowires and nanospheres were fabricated into symmetry-reduced cubic , trough-like and spherical nanocups , respectively. The formation of nanocups is attributed to in situ local nanomasking and selective etching of interfacial nanoparticles at the single-nanoparticle level.
