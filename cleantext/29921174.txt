  Although the importance of tumor size in papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC) is well established , there is no research investigating whether age modifies the impact of tumor size , and there is conflicting evidence regarding optimal size thresholds for prognostic discrimination. We aimed to verify that tumor size is an independent prognostic factor in PTC , investigate the impact of patient age , and identify optimal size cutoffs for risk stratification using objective measures of model performance. A retrospective analysis of 574 patients with PTC , using multivariate Cox regression models to test the impact of tumor size on recurrence-free survival ( RFS). Subgroup analyses were performed in patients aged < 55 and ≥ 55 years. Exploratory analyses to identify optimal size cutoffs for prognostic discrimination were performed using the proportion of variation explained ( PVE) and Harrell 's C-index. Tumor size predicted RFS on multivariate analysis in the overall study cohort ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.16; ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.01-1.34); p = 0.038). In subgroup analysis , there was no association between tumor size and RFS in patients aged < 55 years ( HR 1.11; ( CI 0.89-1.38); p = 0.362). In contrast , size was an independent predictor of RFS in patients aged ≥ 55 years ( HR 1.52; ( CI 1.11-2.07); p = 0.009). In this subgroup , an optimal size threshold of > 2 cm versus ≤ 2 cm ( HR 5.24; ( CI 2.30-11.92); p < 0.001; PVE: 36 %; C-index: 0.66) provided the greatest prognostic discrimination. There was no incremental improvement in prognostic value by further stratification of size. In our PTC cohort , the impact of tumor size on RFS was limited to patients aged ≥ 55 years. A single size threshold of 2 cm maximized prognostic discrimination with tumors > 2 cm associated with a five times higher risk of recurrence than those ≤ 2 cm. These findings need to be validated in independent large cohorts and the potential management and staging implications further studied.
