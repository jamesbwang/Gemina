  During the peripartal period , interpretation of basic clinical signs may be challenging. In the present study , heart rate ( HR) , respiratory rate ( RR) and body temperature ( BT) were evaluated in healthy mares of different breed types and compared to reference values for adult horses from the literature. During daily physical exams of periparturient mares , the HR , RR and BT were evaluated. Differences according to the horse 's size were investigated and in large breeds , the influence of dystocia or retained placenta was analysed. During the last weeks before parturition ( a. p.) , the HR significantly increased and was clearly lower after parturition ( p p.; p < 0.05). In larger horses , the RR increased a. p. and decreased p p. ( p < 0.05). The BT underwent changes in all groups during the periparturient period and was higher p p. ( p < 0.05). In general , values for HR , RR and BT were highest in ponies ( p < 0.05) while the lowest RR was measured in large horses ( p < 0.05). There was no difference in the HR between mares with eutocia or with dystocia ( p > 0.05). By contrast , the RR was significantly higher in mares with dystocia on day 1 p p. ( p < 0.05). Differences in the BT a. p. and p p. occurred only in mares with eutocia ( p < 0.05) and remained within the normal values. Mares with retained placenta did not exhibit significant changes in the HR ( p > 0.05) , but the BT was higher on day 1 p p. ( p < 0.05). Increased HR , RR and BT in mares during late pregnancy suggest a distinct physical performance for a prolonged period of time. Interpretation of these parameters in relation to the mare 's reproductive state is essential to diagnose potential disorders and to determine whether therapy is required.
