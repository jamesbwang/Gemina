  Nature-based solutions provide a variety of benefits in growing cities , ranging from stormwater treatment to amenity provision such as aesthetics. However , the decision-making process involved in the installation of such green infrastructure is not straightforward , as much uncertainty around the location , size , costs and benefits impedes systematic decision-making. We developed a model to simulate decision rules used by local municipalities to install nature-based stormwater treatment systems , namely constructed wetlands , ponds/basins and raingardens. The model was used to test twenty-four scenarios of policy-making , by combining four asset selection , two location selection and three budget constraint decision rules. Based on the case study of a local municipality in Metropolitan Melbourne , Australia , the modelled uptake of stormwater treatment systems was compared with attributes of real-world systems for the simulation period. Results show that the actual budgeted funding is not reliable to predict systems ' uptake and that policy-makers are more likely to plan expenditures based on installation costs. The model was able to replicate the cumulative treatment capacity and the location of systems. As such , it offers a novel approach to investigate the impact of using different decision rules to provide environmental services considering biophysical and economic factors.
