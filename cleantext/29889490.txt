  Novel water-dispersible hybrid iron oxide nanoparticles grafted with a polymeric analogue of dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) were prepared. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with immobilized atom-transfer radical polymerization ( ATRP) initiators were prepared via an in situ method using 12- ( 2-bromoisobutyramido) dodecanoic acid as a surface ligand/initiator. The initiator-functionalized particles were employed in a surface-initiated initiator for continuous activator regeneration ATRP to graft poly ( 2- ( methylsulfinyl) ethyl acrylate) ( a polyacrylate analogue of DMSO) from the surface. The resulting hybrid nanoparticles showed a high magnetic relaxivity ratio ( r
