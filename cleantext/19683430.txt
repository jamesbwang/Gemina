  We previously demonstrated that neurotensin ( NTS) induces local inflammation<symptom> and promotes tumor invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). However , the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear. In this study , positive correlations between NTS and interleukin ( IL) -8 were identified at both the mRNA and protein levels in 71 fresh HCC tissues and 100 paraffin-embedded HCC tissues. Furthermore , significant correlations were determined among the co-expression of NTS and IL-8 , infiltration of inflammatory cells and enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) of HCC cells. NTS-induced IL-8 production was associated with activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-ÎºB) pathways rather than the protein kinase C ( PKC) and phosphoinositide-3 kinase ( PI3K) pathways , whose specific antagonists significantly inhibited activation of the NTS/IL -8 pathway. IL-8 , which promoted EMT and HCC invasion both
