  Prostate cancer ( PC) is a devastating and heterogeneous condition with diverse treatment options. When selecting treatments for patients with very high-risk PC , clinicians must consider patient comorbidities. We investigated the efficacy of the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index ( ACCI) as a prognostic factor for patient outcomes after radical prostatectomy ( RP). We retrospectively investigated the medical records of PC patients at our institution who underwent RP from 1992 to 2010. Very high-risk PC was defined according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Patients with incomplete medical records or who had received neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Preoperative comorbidity was evaluated by the ACCI , and the prognostic efficacy of the ACCI was analyzed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression , competing risk regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves. Our final analysis included 228 men with a median age of 66 years ( interquartile range 62-71) and median prostate specific antigen of 10.7 ng/mL. There were 41 ( 18 %) patients with an ACCI score > 3 and 88 ( 38.6 %) patients with a biopsy Gleason score > 8. Preoperative evaluation revealed that 159 patients ( 69.7 %) had a non-organ confined tumor ( â‰¥ T3). Following RP , 8-year prostate cancer-specific survival ( PCSS) and overall survival ( OS) rates were 91.6 % and 83.4 % , respectively. Competing risk regression analysis revealed that ACCI was significantly associated with other-cause survival and OS ( p < 0.05). The ACCI is an effective prognostic factor for other-cause survival and OS in very high-risk PC patients. RP should be considered carefully for patients with an ACCI score > 3.
