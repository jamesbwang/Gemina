  To evaluate the predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging in retinoblastoma for the likelihood of high-risk pathologic features. A retrospective study of 64 eyes enucleated from 60 retinoblastoma patients. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed before enucleation. Main outcome measures included demographics , laterality , accuracy , sensitivity , and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting high-risk pathologic features. Optic nerve invasion and choroidal invasion were seen microscopically in 34 ( 53 %) and 28 ( 44 %) eyes , respectively , while they were detected in magnetic resonance imaging in 22 ( 34 %) and 15 ( 23 %) eyes , respectively. The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting prelaminar invasion was 77 % ( sensitivity 89 % , specificity 98 %) , 56 % for laminar invasion ( sensitivity 27 % , specificity 94 %) , 84 % for postlaminar invasion ( sensitivity 42 % , specificity 98 %) , and 100 % for optic cut edge invasion ( sensitivity100 % , specificity 100 %). The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting focal choroidal invasion was 48 % ( sensitivity 33 % , specificity 97 %) , and 84 % for massive choroidal invasion ( sensitivity 53 % , specificity 98 %) , and the accuracy in detecting extrascleral extension was 96 % ( sensitivity 67 % , specificity 98 %). Magnetic resonance imaging should not be the only method to stratify patients at high risk from those who are not , eventhough it can predict with high accuracy extensive postlaminar optic nerve invasion , massive choroidal invasion , and extrascleral tumor extension.
