  Glioblastoma multiforme<pathogen> ( GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant glioma , with patients having a median survival of just over one year. Current chemotherapies , with surgery and radiotherapy , provide only minor patient benefit. There is a great need to discover and develop novel therapies for this devastating disease. Areas covered: The patent literature reveals novel therapies , providing insights into emerging GBM therapeutics. We have used the Google and USPTO patent databases to generate a detailed landscape of patents and patent applications from companies active in the areas of glioma and/or GBM. Specific patents have been grouped into six areas: novel compounds; treatments and therapeutic targets; combination therapies; immunotherapies; delivery methods; and biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Expert opinion: There has been a steady increase in the number of patents on GBM over the last five years. Despite many new compounds being developed and patented for a broad range of cancers , only a small percentage of these are specifically targeted to GBM. Notable trends in the patent literature include both the development of combination therapies to combat the heterogeneous nature of GBM , and the use of immunotherapies building on the promise of cancer vaccines and CAR T-cell therapy.
