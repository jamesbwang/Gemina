  Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ( panNETs) are often inoperable at diagnosis. The mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus has been approved for the treatment of advanced NETs. However , the regular development of resistance to everolimus limits its clinical efficacy. We established two independent everolimus-resistant panNET ( BON1) cell lines ( BON1 RR1 , BON1 RR2) to find potential mechanisms of resistance. After 24 weeks of permanent exposure to 10 nM everolimus , BON1 RR1 and BON1 RR2 showed stable resistance with cellular survival rates of 96.70 % ( IC50 = 5200 nM) and 92.30 % ( IC50 = 2500 nM) , respectively. The control cell line showed sensitivity to 10 nM everolimus with cellular survival declining to 54.70 % ( IC50 = 34 nM). Both resistant cell lines did not regain sensitivity over time and showed persistent stable resistance after a drug holiday of 13 weeks. The mechanisms of resistance in our cell line model included morphological adaptations , G1 cell cycle arrest associated with reduced CDK1 ( cdc2) expression and decreased autophagy. Cellular migration potential was increased and indirectly linked to c-Met activation. GSK3 was over-activated in association with reduced basal IRS-1 protein levels. Specific GSK3 inhibition strongly decreased BON1 RR1/RR2 cell survival. The combination of everolimus with the PI3KÎ± inhibitor BYL719 re-established everolimus sensitivity through GSK3 inhibition and restoration of autophagy. We suggest that GSK3 over-activation combined with decreased basal IRS-1 protein levels and decreased autophagy may be a crucial feature of everolimus resistance , and hence a possible therapeutic target.
