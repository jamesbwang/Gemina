  Common psychiatric symptoms may hinder achieving ideal cardiovascular health ( ICH). We aimed to investigate the association between the ICH score and psychiatric disorders in Brazilian adults. In this cross-sectional analysis , 13,743 participants free of cardiovascular disease from the ELSA-Brasil study were assessed using the American Heart Association ICH score. Cardiovascular health was classified as poor ( 0-2 ideal metrics) , intermediate ( 3-4 ideal metrics) , and optimal ( 5-7 ideal metrics). We used the Clinical Interview Scheduled Revised ( CIS-R) to assess psychiatric disorders and investigate their association with the ICH score and each non-ICH metric. The frequency of poor , intermediate , and optimal cardiovascular health were 54.1 % , 38.1 % , and 7.8 % , respectively. Depressive and anxiety<symptom> disorders were associated with poor cardiovascular health ( depressive disorder: OR = 2.49 , 95 % CI = 1.62-3.80 , p < 0.001; anxiety<symptom> disorder: OR = 1.47 , 95 % CI = 1.22-1.78 , p < 0.001) , and intermediate cardiovascular health ( depressive disorder: OR = 1.94 , 95 % CI = 1.26-2.98 , p = 0.002; anxiety<symptom> disorder: OR = 1.22 , 95 % CI = 1.01-1.47 , p = 0.043). In the analysis stratified by sex , these associations were significant only among women. The disorders were also associated with the following non-ICH metrics: body mass index , physical activity , healthy diet score , and smoking. Participants with depressive disorder and anxiety<symptom> disorder had expected lower global and lifestyle ICH score than participants without these conditions , with significant results among women in the stratified analysis. Psychiatric comorbidity was associated with poorer cardiovascular health. These conditions may compromise the adoption of healthy cardiovascular risk reduction behaviors.
