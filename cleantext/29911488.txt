  Objective This study was performed to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) colonization upon intensive care unit ( ICU) admission and during the ICU stay in mainland China. Methods A prospective observational study was performed in a 50-bed general ICU of a 4300-bed teaching hospital in China from 2011 to 2013. Nasal swabs for MRSA detection were obtained upon ICU admission and at discharge for patients having stayed in the ICU for longer than 3 days. Results In total , 115 patients ( 4.1 %; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 3.4-4.9) were already colonized with MRSA on ICU admission , and another 185 patients ( 10.7 %; 95 % CI , 9.3-12.2) acquired MRSA during their ICU stay. Development of an MRSA infection was significantly more likely in patients with than without MRSA colonization on ICU admission ( odds ratio ( OR) , 2.8; 95 % CI , 1.1-7.3). Patients who acquired MRSA had significantly prolonged lengths of stay in the ICU ( 23.3 days) and higher hospital bills ( 135,171 RMB; about 19,590 USD) than those who tested negative for MRSA. Conclusion The MRSA colonization rate among ICU patients in mainland China is high. Patients with MRSA-positive nasal swabs are more likely to develop MRSA infections.
