  Termites and their nests are potential resources for a wide assemblage of taxa including nematodes. During dispersal flight events from termite colonies , co-occurring nematodes in the nest may have phoretic opportunities to use termite alates as transportation hosts. The two subterranean termite species Coptotermes gestroi ( Wasmann) and Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki are both invasive and established in south Florida. Alates of both species ( n = 245) were collected during dispersal flight events in 2015-2016 from six locations , of which 30 ( 12.2 %) were associated with one or more species of nematodes. Species of Bunonema Jägerskiöld ( Rhabditida: Bunonematidae) , Halicephalobus Timm ( Rhabditda: Panagrolaimidae) , and Poikilolaimus regenfussi ( Sudhaus) Sudhaus and Koch ( Rhabditida: Rhabditidae) were isolated from 5.3 , 4.9 , and 0.4 % of termite alates , respectively , and Bunonema and Halicephalobus were concomitant in 1.6 % of alates. Additional C. formosanus alates were field-collected to establish laboratory colonies in sterilized rearing containers ( SRC) to determine if alate-associated nematodes would colonize the newly established nest and/or brood. Among 1-yr-old termite colonies reared in SRCs , 26.9 % of the colonies were positive for nematodes confirming that within-colony transmission of nematodes occurred. All three isolated nematode genera are free-living bacterivores capable of asexual reproduction. This suggests that these common co-occurring , termite-associated nematodes are opportunistic and facultative symbionts that receive increased opportunities of geographical dispersion through phoresy during termite dispersal flight events.
