  To clone the circular RNA hsa_circ_0000254 and construct its lentiviral over-expression vector. The sequence of hsa_circ_0000254 ( a total of 524 bp long) was synthesized and cloned by using pGH vector. The vector was cut by EcoR I and BamH I , and artificial hsa_circ_0000254 was obtained , then inserted in pLCDH-ciR to construct the recombinant expression vector pLCDH-circ254 ( C254) , which was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The lentiviral expression vectors pLCDH-circ254 ( C254) and NC ( pLCDH-ciR) were cotransfected into 293T cells by lipofectamine Restriction analysis and DNA sequencing demonstrated that the lentiviral vector pLCDH-circ254 ( C254) was constructed successfully , the expression efficiency increased 10000 times after transfection of cells. The successful construction of the lentiviral expression vector pLCDH-circ254 ( C254) results in the production of high-titer lentivirus , so as to facilitate further study of the molecular functions of hsa_circ_0000254.
