  The present paper investigates the enhancement of the therapeutic effect of Paclitaxel ( a potent anticancer drug) by increasing its cellular uptake in the cancerous cells with subsequent reduction in its cytotoxic effects. To fulfill these goals the Paclitaxel ( PTX)- Biotinylated PAMAM dendrimer complexes were prepared using biotinylation method. The primary parameter of Biotinylated PAMAM with a terminal HN
