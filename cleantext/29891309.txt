  This study describes the preparation of an aerogel adsorbent based on nanofibrillated cellulose ( NFC) and polyethyleneimine ( PEI) via electrostatic combination without chemical crosslinking. Purely physical crosslinking between NFC and PEI was confirmed by attenuated total refraction-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ATR-FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA). The NFC/PEI hybrid aerogels exhibited good structural stability and shape recovery in water. Absorption experiment shows that the hybrid aerogels are excellent adsorbents for the removal of heavy metal ions owing to the highly porous structure and the existence of plenty of amine groups. Thermodynamic and kinetic study showed pseudo-second-order equation and Langmuir model ( R
