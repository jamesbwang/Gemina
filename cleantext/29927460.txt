  An arteriovenous ( AV) access flow ( Qa) of 400 mL/min is usually sufficient for an effective hemodialysis ( HD) , but some accesses continue developing and become high flow accesses ( HFA). Some authors postulated that an HFA might shift a significant portion of dialyzed blood from the cardiac output , which could decrease HD efficiency and lead to volume overload. The aim of our study was to evaluate if HFA is associated with reduced HD efficiency and/or volume overload in prevalent HD patients. We performed a 1-year retrospective study and assessed HD efficiency by the percentage of sessions in which the Kt/V > 1.4 and volume overload by bioimpedance spectroscopy. The study included 304 prevalent HD patients with a mean age of 67.5 years; 62.5 % were males , 36.2 % were diabetics , with a median HD vintage of 48 months. Sixteen percent of the patients had a HFA ( defined as Qa > 2 L/min). In multivariate analysis , patients with HFA presented higher risk of volume overload ( OR = 2.67 , 95 % CI = 1.06-6.71) and severe volume overload ( OR = 4.06 , 95 % CI = 1.01-16.39) and attained dry weight less frequently ( OR = 0.37 , 95 % CI = 0.14-0.94). However , HFA was not associated with lower Kt/V. Our results suggest that patients with HFA have higher risk of volume overload. However , contrarily to what has been postulated , HFA was not associated with less efficient dialysis , measured by Kt/V. Randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify these questions.
