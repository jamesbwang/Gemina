  To present the hearing results of a 5-year longitudinal study in a pediatric population undergoing surgery for extensive cholesteatoma using a canal wall up ( CWU) approach with bony obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanic space , with a standard residual rate of 5.8 % , a recurrence rate of 2.9 % , and all ears<disease> waterproof , free of otorrhea and all external ear canals patent and self-cleaning. Retrospective consecutive study. Thirty-three children ( â‰¤ 18 yr) undergoing surgery for cholesteatoma ( 34 ears<disease>) between 1997 and 2009. Therapeutic. Tertiary referral center. Hearing and gain in hearing at 1- and 5-year postsurgery: ( 1) pure-tone average ( PTA) , ( 2) pure-tone average high frequency , ( 3) pure-tone average including 3 kHz , ( 4) bone conduction at corresponding frequency averages , ( 5) gain at corresponding air conduction and bone conduction ( gain at corresponding air conduction) frequency averages. ( 6) The Amsterdam Hearing Evaluation Plots were used to study the individual cases. The Amsterdam Hearing Evaluation Plots at 5-year showed in 58.8 % of patients a positive gain air conduction. In 23.5 % a successful functional result was achieved , defined as an air-bone gap closure to 20 dBHL or less. In 6 patients ( 17.6 %) a limited bone conduction deterioration was shown all limited to maximum 20 dBHL. The CWU bony obliteration tympanoplasty in a consecutive series of pediatric extensive cholesteatoma shows a similar to slightly improved hearing outcome as compared with CWU surgery without BOT. Although the series shows a clearly reduced reoperation rate and a significantly improved safety and hygienic outcome as compared with CWU without BOT , better hearing outcomes remain desirable in this group of children.
