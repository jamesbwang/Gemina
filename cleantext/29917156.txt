  Duck hepatitis<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> type 1 ( DHAV-1) is a serious infectious virus of ducklings. Recent study showed baicalin ( BA) and baicalin phospholipid complex ( BAPC) possessed anti-DHAV-1 effect. However , the antiviral mechanism is not clear. Therefore , the aim of the present work is to study influences and mechanisms of BA and BAPC on DHAV-1. The effects of BA and BAPC on DHAV-1 replication were analyzed by CCK-8 and RT-qPCR methods. And the results showed BA inhibited the replication of DHAV-1 , and BAPC was more effective. Then , the influences of BA and BAPC on DHAV-1 protein translation and RNA synthesis were detected by western blot and RT-qPCR. Both BA and BAPC inhibited the protein translation , and BAPC did better. Furthermore , BAPC also inhibited the RNA synthesis. Afterwards , DHAV-1 IRES activity , DHAV-1 3D protein stability , and cellular Hsp70 expression were studied to in-depth understand the inhibition effects of BA and BAPC on DHAV-1 replication. The results indicated BA and BAPC dropped the protein translation via suppressing DHAV-1 IRES activity. Additionally , BAPC dropped the RNA synthesis via reducing the 3D protein stability and inhibiting cellular Hsp70 expression.
