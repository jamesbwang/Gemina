  General practitioners ( GPs) report little adverse drug reactions ( ADR) , although it is mandatory in France. The objective was to evaluate the satisfaction of the GPs who participated to a pharmacovigilance ADR declaration support network via a clinical research assistant ( CRA) moving to their GP office in the French South-West region of Midi-Pyrénées. A satisfaction questionnaire was sent to the 59 active GPs of this network in November 2016. A total number of 44 GPs responded to the survey ( mean age 44 ± 11 years; 48 % of women). The overall satisfaction grade was rated 9/10 ( SD ± 1). The personalized help from a CRA was highly appreciated ( n = 39; 89 %) , reduced time-loss ( n = 35; 90 %) , and facilitated communication with the local pharmacovigilance department ( n = 33; 85 %). Most GP ( 95 %; n = 35) stated that they would keep reporting ADRs , 83 % ( n = 35) stated to declare ADRs via the CRA , the others stated to declare ADRs directly to the Regional Pharmacovigilance Center , mainly via numerical or online tools. For 59 % ( n = 26) their participation to the network had a positive impact on their relationship with patients through the improvement of their vigilance to ADR. Most of the active GP answered. They were very satisfied of the pharmacovigilance CRA network helping ADR reports. It may corroborate the increase of ADRs reporting in Midi-Pyrénées since this network was set up.
