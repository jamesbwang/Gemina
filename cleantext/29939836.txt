  Evolutionary theories are necessarily invoked for understanding cancer development at the level of species , at the level of cells and tissues , and for developing effective therapies. It is crucial to view cancer in a Darwinian light , where the differential survival of individual cells is based on heritable variations. In the process of this somatic evolution , multicellularity controls are overridden by cancer cells , which become increasingly autonomous. Ecological epigenetics also helps understand how rogue cells that have basically the same DNA as their normal cell counterpart overcome the tissue homeostasis. As we struggle to wrap our minds around the complexity of these phenomena , we apply often times anthropomorphic terms , such as subversion , hijacking , or hacking<symptom> , to describe especially the most complex among them-the interaction of tumors with the immune system. In this commentary we highlight examples of the anthropomorphic thinking of cancer and try to put into context the relative meaning of terms and the mechanisms that are oftentimes invoked to justify those terms.
