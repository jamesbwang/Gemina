  Coetzee , B , and Malan , D. Laboratory-based physical and physiological test results that serve as predictors of male , amateur road cyclists ' performance levels. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The purposes of this study were first , to determine the practical significant differences of laboratory-based physical and physiological test results between a selected group of successful and less successful amateur , male road cyclists from Africa; and second , to determine the significance , adequacy , accurateness , and usefulness of laboratory-based physical and physiological test results to serve as predictors of these amateur , male road cyclists ' performance levels. Male road cyclists , identified as the top amateur road cyclists of the cycling federations of 13 African countries , were subjected to a test battery for the measurement of lower-body flexibility , abdominal strength , peak and average anaerobic power output as well as maximum aerobic power. Practical significant differences between the successful and less successful road cyclists were found for almost all the Wingate related variables , some of the sub-maximum parameters , and most of the maximum physiological variables. Finally , the abdominal muscle strength test value , vertical jump distance , Wingate relative peak power , and respiratory compensation point expressed as percentage of V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max and as relative power output were the physiological components that acted as adequate , accurate , and useful predictors of performance levels. Coaches and sport scientists should therefore include these components in testing protocols that are aimed at evaluating and improving cyclists ' physical conditioning programs.
