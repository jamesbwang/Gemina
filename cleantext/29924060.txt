  To systematically review the recent evidence on physical therapy ( PT) diagnosis , prognosis , and intervention of congenital muscular torticollis<symptom> to inform the update to the PT management of congenital muscular torticollis<symptom> evidence-based clinical practice guideline. From 2012 to 2017 , 7 databases were searched for studies that informed PT diagnosis , prognosis , or intervention of infants and children with congenital muscular torticollis<symptom>. Studies were appraised for risk of bias and quality. Twenty studies were included. No studies informed PT diagnosis. Fourteen studies informed prognosis , including factors associated with presence of a sternocleidomastoid lesion<symptom> , extent of symptom resolution , treatment duration , adherence to intervention , cervical spine outcomes , and motor outcome. Six studies informed intervention including stretching frequency , microcurrent , kinesiology tape , group therapy , and postoperative PT. New evidence supports that low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight , breech presentation , and motor asymmetry are prognostic factors associated with longer treatment duration. Higher-level evidence is emerging for microcurrent intervention.
