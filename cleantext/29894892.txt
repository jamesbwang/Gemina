  The first activation study of a η-class carbonic anhydrase ( CAs , EC 4.2.1.1) is reported. A panel of 24 natural and non-natural amino acids and amines was used to explore the activation profile of Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> CA ( PfACA). The most effective activators belonged to the amino acid chemotype , with d-Glu , l-Asp , l-/ d-Phe and l-/ d-DOPA possessing activation constant in the range of 82 nM-0.75 µM , whereas l-/ d-His , l-Tyr , 4-amino-l-Phe and l-Gln were slightly less effective ( K
