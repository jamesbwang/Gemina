  Currently there are only a limited number of drugs available for treatment of androgenetic alopecia and telogen effluvium. However , certain plants and their standardized extracts may provide some clinical benefits against hair loss. We formulated a herbal shampoo and a solution to evaluate their efficacy , safety , and synergy in hair loss. We conducted a randomized , placebo-controlled , single-blind , clinical and instrumental study for 6 months on 120 subjects with androgenetic alopecia and telogen effluvium , confirmed by pull test and phototricogram. Each subject was examined monthly. At the end of the study , a self-assessment test was carried out. Herbal formulations were found to be more effective in preventing and reducing hair loss than placebo at every assessment point. Anagen/telogen ratios improved significantly in the study group. In addition , concomitant use of the shampoo and solution were found to be more effective than single product use. We interpret this eutrophic effect for scalp hair as the final outcome of the entire content of our herbal formula , which has antiandrogenic , anti-inflammatory , antioxidative , angiogenic , and hair-stimulating features. In combination , these features help prevent hair from falling out and reducing hair loss.
