  The formation of the bilirubin oxidation products ( BOXes) , BOX A ( ( 4-methyl-5-oxo-3-vinyl- ( 1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ylidene) acetamide)) and BOX B ( 3-methyl-5-oxo-4-vinyl- ( 1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ylidene) acetamide) , as well as MVM ( 4-methyl-3-vinylmaleimide) were synthesized by oxidation of bilirubin with H
