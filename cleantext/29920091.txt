  The hydrophilic extracts of eggplant peel ( HEEP) and purple sweet potato ( HEPP) and lipophilic extracts of tomato ( LET) and carrot ( LEC) were mixed in different ratios to assess the significance of the compatibility of aliments , based on their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory interactions in H9c2 cells. The results indicated that groups of some combinational extracts ( HEPP-HEEP F1/10 , LEC-HEEP F3/10 , LEC-HEPP F3/10) showed stronger synergistic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects than individual groups. For example , the glutathione peroxidase ( GPx) activity of the LEC-HEEP ( F3/10) group ( 86.71 ± 1.88) was higher than that in the HEEP ( 79.97 ± 1.68) and LEC ( 77.31 ± 1.85) groups. The level of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) was 30.37 ± 0.25 in the LEC-HEEP ( F3/10) group while the levels were 34.34 ± 0.36 and 46.23 ± 0.51 in the HEEP and LEC groups , respectively. And the level of malondialdehyde ( MDA) was 1.82 ± 0.24 in the LEC-HEEP ( F3/10) group while the levels were 2.48 ± 0.13 and 3.01 ± 0.24 in the HEEP and LEC groups , respectively. The expressions of inflammatory mediators ( IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-8) and cell adhesion molecules ( VCAM-1 , ICAM-1) showed similar tendencies. However , some groups ( LET-LEC F5/10 , LET-LEC F9/10 , LET-HEPP F7/10) showed antagonistic effects based on these indicators. The principal component analysis showed that samples could be defined by two principal components: PC1 , the main phenolic acids and flavonoids; PC2 , carotenoids. Moreover , phenolics and anthoyanins were in the majority in synergistic groups , and carotenoids were in the majority in antagonistic groups. These results indicated that there exist synergistic or antagonistic interactions of aliments on antioxidation and anti-inflammation , which implied the significance of food compatibility.
