  Nurses working in haemodialysis units are expected to demonstrate competency and understanding of the technical processes involved in supporting patients undergoing haemodialysis treatment. In 2012 the nursing education team within a large acute National Health Service ( NHS) London Hospital Group updated and standardised haemodialysis clinical competencies to assist junior haemodialysis nurses develop their clinical skills and knowledge in delivering nursing care to patients receiving haemodialysis treatment. A qualitative interpretive phenomenological methodology using semi-structured interviews investigated the lived experiences of novice haemodialysis nurses and mentors using these competencies. Nineteen participants including ten novice nurses and nine mentors were recruited from six haemodialysis units within a large acute NHS London Hospital Group. The main findings identified that the haemodialysis clinical competencies were beneficial in developing novice nurses ' haemodialysis skills , knowledge and competence. The competencies provided them with a structured framework for assessing competence. Novice nurses experienced stress and anxiety<symptom> , particularly when they were faced with new and unfamiliar situations. The results obtained concluded the crucial role of expert haemodialysis nurses in mentoring and training novice nurses. The importance of competent skilled nurses in providing care to patients receiving haemodialysis treatment and the value of a competency document were strongly emphasised.
