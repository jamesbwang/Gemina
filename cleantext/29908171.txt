  Guadeloupe islands are threatened by several mosquito-borne viruses such as Dengue , Chikungunya , Zika and West<pathogen> Nile<pathogen> virus<pathogen> It appears essential to look for alternative mosquito control methods such as the incompatible insect technique ( ITT) aiming at sterilizing wild females by inundative releases of incompatible males. Before considering the implementation of such a strategy , the characterization of genetic diversity of the endocellular bacterium<pathogen> Wolbachia<pathogen> regarding the local mosquito populations is a critical issue. Here , for the first time , we describe the prevalence and diversity of Wolbachia in natural populations of three mosquito species from Guadeloupe: Aedes<pathogen> aegypti , Aedes<pathogen> taeniorhynchus and Culex quinquefasciatus. The detection of Wolbachia in natural Ae. aegypti , Ae. taeniorhynchus and Cx. quinquefasciatus populations was conducted by studying Wolbachia 16S ribosomal RNA gene using a TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR and results were confirmed by conventional PCR and sequencing. In addition , molecular typing of wPip strains in Cx. quinquefasciatus was done by PCR-RFLP. We did not find Wolbachia infection in any of Ae. aegypti and Ae. taeniorhynchus studied populations. Natural Wolbachia infection was detected in Cx. quinquefasciatus with prevalence varying from 79.2 % to 95.8 %. In addition , no polymorphism was found between the Wolbachia strains infecting Cx. quinquefasciatus specimens , all carrying an infection from the same Wolbachia genetic wPip-I group. These results pave the way for the evaluation of the feasibility of IIT programs to fight against these medically-important mosquito species in Guadeloupe.
