  Vitiligo is a common pigmentary disorder. Studies on its pathogenesis extensively investigated melanocytes ' abnormalities and few studies searched for keratinocytes ' role in disease development. Liver X receptor-α ( LXR-α) is a member of nuclear hormone receptors that acts as a transcription factor. Its target genes are the main regulators of melanocyte functions. The aim of this study is to investigate keratinocytes ' role in vitiligo pathogenesis through immunohistochemical expression of LXR-α in lesional , perilesional , and distant nonlesional vitiligo skin. This case-control study was carried out on 44 participants. These included 24 patients with vitiligo and 20 age- and sex-matched normal individuals as a control group. Biopsies , from cases , were taken from lesional , perilesional , and distant nonlesional areas. Evaluation was done using immunohistochemical technique. Keratinocyte LXR-α expression was upregulated in the lesional and perilesional skin ( follicular and interfollicular epidermis) compared with control skin ( LXR-α upregulation is associated with keratinocyte damage in vitiligo lesional skin that leads to decreased keratinocyte-derived mediators and growth factors supporting the growth and/or melanization of surrounding melanocytes. Therefore , melanocyte function and survival are affected.
