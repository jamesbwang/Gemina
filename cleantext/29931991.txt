  Dysphagia<symptom> lusoria ( lusus naturae , latin for `` freak of nature '') describes dysphagia<symptom> because of vascular compression of the esophagus. Symptoms , when present , occur at the two extremes of life. Owing to the more flexible and compressible nature of the trachea , children usually present with respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , in contrast to adults , who more often present with dysphagia<symptom>. Here , we report the case of a six-year-old child presenting with a history of progressive<symptom> dysphagia<symptom> without respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. A barium esophagogram showed a diagonal impression in the proximal esophagus , while at esophagogastroduodenoscopy there was an extrinsic pulsatile bulging area suggesting an extrinsic compression by an aberrant vessel. Angio-CT ( computed tomography) scan confirmed the presence of an aberrant right subclavian artery.
