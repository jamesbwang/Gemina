  The impact of aging is as inevitable in the larynx as on all biologic systems. The muscles of larynx have the potential to atrophy , the elastin fibers of lamina propria thin with age , and mucous production diminishes. As a result , vocal folds fail to approximate appropriately and the stress on once-robust vocal folds increases. These changes present as poor voice quality , vocal tension , tremor<symptom> , and altered fundamental frequency. Rather than consider presbyphonia as an immutable diagnosis , we must see it as an opportunity to elevate our standard of care and set goals to work for therapeutic improvement of voice quality.
