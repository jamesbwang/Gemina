  Solitary fibrous tumor of kidney is an unusual condition. It is spindle cell tumor with mesenchymal in origin so most commonly reported cases are in pleura , and extra-pleural sites are very rare. It is mostly benign in nature but malignant variant are also reported. Treatment is en bloc resection as in other sites whether pleural or extra-pleural. Prognosis is excellent. This tumor is difficult to diagnose only on imaging features; so for diagnosis , histopathology is needed mostly with immunohistochemical markers like CD34 , CD99 , Bcl2 proteins. A middle-aged male presented initially with clinical and radiological features , suspected of renal cell carcinoma. Surgery was performed , which proved solitary fibrous tumor on histopathology; and patient on follow-up remained tumor-free till the last follow-up.
