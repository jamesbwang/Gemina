  Membrane reactors for hydrogen production have been extensively studied in the past years due to the interest in developing systems that are adequate for the decentralized production of high-purity hydrogen. Research in this field has been both experimental and theoretical. The aim of this work is two-fold. On the one hand , modeling work on membrane reactors that has been carried out in the past is presented and discussed , along with the constitutive equations used to describe the different phenomena characterizing the behavior of the system. On the other hand , an attempt is made to shed some light on the meaning and usefulness of models developed with different degrees of complexity. The motivation has been that , given the different ways and degrees in which transport models can be simplified , the process is not always straightforward and , in some cases , leads to conceptual inconsistencies that are not easily identifiable or identified.
