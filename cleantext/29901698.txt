  Insulin response may be important in colorectal cancer development. Diet modulates insulin response and may be a modifiable factor in colorectal cancer prevention. We examined associations between hyperinsulinemic diets and colorectal cancer risk with the use of an empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia ( EDIH) , a food-based index that characterizes dietary insulinemic potential on the basis of circulating C-peptide concentrations. Diet was assessed every 4 y with food-frequency questionnaires in 46,210 men ( Health Professionals Follow-Up Study , 1986-2012) and 74,191 women ( Nurses ' Health Study , 1984-2012) to calculate EDIH scores. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to calculate HRs and 95 % CIs for colorectal , proximal/distal colon , and rectal cancer risk. During 26 y of follow-up , we documented 2683 incident colorectal cancer cases. Comparing participants in the highest with those in the lowest quintiles , higher EDIH scores were associated with 33 % ( men: HR: 1.33; 95 % CI: 1.11 , 1.61; P-trend = 0.0005) , 22 % ( women: HR: 1.22; 95 % CI: 1.03 , 1.45; P-trend = 0.01) , and 26 % ( men and women: pooled HR: 1.26; 95 % CI: 1.12 , 1.42; P-trend < 0.0001) higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. The positive associations were limited to the distal colon and rectum in men and to the distal and proximal colon in women; however , combined risk estimates were significant for all anatomic locations except for the rectum. For example , comparing participants in extreme EDIH quintiles , there was no significant association for proximal colon cancer in men ( HR: 1.15; 95 % CI: 0.84 , 1.57; P-trend = 0.32) , but the risk was elevated for distal colon ( HR: 1.63; 95 % CI: 1.14 , 2.32; P-trend = 0.002) and rectal ( HR: 1.63; 95 % CI: 1.09 , 2.44; P-trend = 0.01) cancer. Among women , the risk was elevated for proximal ( HR: 1.28; 95 % CI: 1.00 , 1.63; P-trend = 0.03) and distal ( HR: 1.46; 95 % CI: 1.05 , 2.03; P-trend = 0.03) colon cancer but not for rectal cancer ( HR: 0.88; 95 % CI: 0.60 , 1.29; P-trend = 0.61). The findings suggest that the insulinemic potential of diet may partly underlie the influence of dietary intake on colorectal cancer development.
