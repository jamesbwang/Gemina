  An exaggerated blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) response to maximal exercise is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality. It is unclear whether treating BP to guideline recommended levels could normalize the rise in BP during exercise , which is mediated by the metaboreflex. We aimed to assess the BP response to incremental exercise testing and metaboreflex activation in treated-controlled hypertension ( n = 16) , treated-uncontrolled hypertension ( n = 16) , and untreated hypertension ( n = 11) and 16 control participants with normal BP ( n = 16). All groups were matched for age and body mass index. BP was measured during an incremental Vo
