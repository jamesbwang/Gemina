  To investigate correlation between rectal wall thickness ( RWT) and anorectal pressures , in obstructed defecation syndrome<disease> ( ODS) patients caused by internal rectal prolapse. ODS patients and healthy volunteers ( HVs) underwent 3D endorectal ultrasound ( 3D-EUS) and high-resolution anorectal manometry ( HRAM); RWT , total rectal wall volume ( TRWV) , pushing endorectal pressure ( PEP) , recto-anal gradient were determined RESULTS: We enrolled 35 ODS patients and 25 HVs. Patients showed markedly decreased TRWV , PEP , and recto-anal gradient. Linear correlation was found between markedly reduced TRWV and markedly hypotonic PEP. HRAM and 3D-EUS could be performed in ODS assessment , to better understand rectal function.
