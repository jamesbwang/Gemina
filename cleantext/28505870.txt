  Discontinuous transitions have received considerable interest due to the uncovering that many phenomena such as catastrophic changes , epidemic outbreaks and synchronization present a behavior signed by abrupt ( macroscopic) changes ( instead of smooth ones) as a tuning parameter is changed. However , in different cases there are still scarce microscopic models reproducing such above trademarks. With these ideas in mind , we investigate the key ingredients underpinning the discontinuous transition in one of the simplest systems with up-down Z
