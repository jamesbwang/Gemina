  Surface plasmonic polariton ( SPP) has attracted increasing interest for its ability of confining light in the subwavelength scale and breaking the diffraction limit. Recently , there have appeared several important developments of SPP applied in plasmon rulers , waveguides and resonators. By combing these concepts we present a novel hybrid plasmonic microring nano-ruler relying on the sensitive hybrid mode property and the microring resonator structure. The designed nano-ruler can measure distance in nanoscale resolution and offer adjustable sensitivity , which exceeds 14.8 as the distance is less than 5 nm by recording the transmission spectra and outstrips 200 dB/nm by observing the shift of output intensity. These demonstrations suggest that hybrid plasmonic microring nano-ruler could be a promising candidate enabling high-resoluation measurement.
