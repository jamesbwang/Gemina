  Optimising nutrition support in critically ill patients with an open abdomen is challenging. The aims of this study were to ( i) quantify the amount and adequacy of nutrition support administered and ( ii) determine any relationships that exist between mode of nutrition support delivery and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with an open abdomen. A retrospective review of critically ill patients mechanically ventilated for at least 48 h with an open abdomen in a mixed quaternary referral intensive care unit. Enteral and parenteral nutrition ( ml) administered daily to patients was recorded for up to 21 days. Length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital and duration of mechanical ventilation ( days) were reported. Thirty patients were studied ( 14 male , 68 y ( 15-90 y) , body mass index 25 kg/m Patients with an open abdomen receive about half of their nutrition requirements when fed exclusively via the enteral route. Providing combination enteral and parenteral nutrition to reach nutritional goals may not result in better clinical outcomes for patients with an open abdomen.
