  The leukocyte receptor complex ( LRC) encodes numerous immunoglobulin ( Ig)- like receptors involved in innate immunity. These include the killer-cell Ig-like receptors ( KIR) and the leukocyte Ig-like receptors ( LILR) which can be polymorphic and vary greatly in number between species. Using the recent long-read genome assembly , Sscrofa11 .1 , we have characterized the porcine LRC on chromosome 6. We identified a ~ 197-kb region containing numerous LILR genes that were missing in previous assemblies. Out of 17 such LILR genes and fragments , six encode functional proteins , of which three are inhibitory and three are activating , while the majority of pseudogenes had the potential to encode activating receptors. Elsewhere in the LRC , between FCAR and GP6 , we identified a novel gene that encodes two Ig-like domains and a long inhibitory intracellular tail. Comparison with two other porcine assemblies revealed a second , nearly identical , non-functional gene encoding a short intracellular tail with ambiguous function. These novel genes were found in a diverse range of mammalian species , including a pseudogene in humans , and typically consist of a single long-tailed receptor and a variable number of short-tailed receptors. Using porcine transcriptome data , both the novel inhibitory gene and the LILR were highly expressed in peripheral blood , while the single KIR gene , KIR2DL1 , was either very poorly expressed or not at all. These observations are a prerequisite for improved understanding of immune cell functions in the pig and other species.
