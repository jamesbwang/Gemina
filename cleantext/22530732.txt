  Late embryogenesis abundant ( LEA) proteins accumulate in plants during adverse conditions and their main attributed function is to confer tolerance to stress. One of the deleterious effects of the adverse environment is the accumulation of metal ions to levels that generate reactive oxygen species , compromising the survival of cells. AtLEA4-5 , a member of group 4 of LEAs in
