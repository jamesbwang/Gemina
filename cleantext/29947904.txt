  Seized samples of illegally produced cocaine have a very large variability in composition; a fact that may result in a challenge to their analysis. We demonstrate here a simple and fast method to detect the presence of cocaine in both hydrochloride and free-base forms in illicit drug samples by nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) spectroscopy. This is achieved by combining the commonly used 1D spectra and diffusion-ordered spectroscopy and introducing the 2D maximum-quantum NMR approach to forensic analysis. The protocol allows the facile determination of the cocaine forms even in the presence of multiple adulterants. By relying on non-uniform sampling acceleration of 2D spectroscopy , the identification can be obtained in less than 3 min for 10 mg of product. Moreover , we show that intermolecular interactions of the sample constituents , while affecting the analysis result , do not interfere with the quality of the detection of the proposed protocol.
