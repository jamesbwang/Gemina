  Resonant tunneling is an efficient mechanism for charge transport through nanoscale conductance junctions due to the relatively high currents involved. However , continuous charging and discharging cycles of the nanoconductor during resonant tunneling often lead to mechanical instability. The realization of efficient nanoscale electronic components therefore depends to a large extent on the ability to mechanically stabilize them during resonant transport. In this work , we focus on single-molecule junctions , demonstrating that their mechanical stability during resonant transport can be increased by increasing the bias voltage. This counter-intuitive effect is attributed to the energy dependence of the molecule-lead coupling densities , which promote the rate of transport-induced cooling of molecular vibrations at higher voltages. The required energy dependence is characteristic of realistic electrodes ( such as graphene) , which can not be modeled within the commonly invoked wide-band approximation. Our research provides new guidelines for the design of mechanically stable molecular devices operating in the regime of resonant charge transport and demonstrates these guidelines while considering realistic features of single-molecule junctions.
