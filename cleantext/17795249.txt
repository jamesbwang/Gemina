  Velvet ants are a group of parasitic wasps that are well known for a suite of defensive adaptations including bright coloration and a formidable sting. While these adaptations are presumed to function in antipredator defense , observations between potential predators and this group are lacking. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the risk of velvet ants to a host of potential predators including amphibians , reptiles , birds , and small mammals. Velvet ants from across the United States were tested with predator 's representative of the velvet ants native range. All interactions between lizards , free-ranging birds , and a mole resulted in the velvet ants survival , and ultimate avoidance by the predator. Two shrews did injure a velvet ant , but this occurred only after multiple failed attacks. The only predator to successfully consume a velvet ant was a single American toad (
