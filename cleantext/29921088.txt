  Compared to an equivalent sized polyvinyl chloride ( PVC) double-lumen tube ( DLT) , a silicone DLT has a shorter endobronchial segment. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of clinically significant displacement of left-sided PVC and silicone DLTs after a positional change to a lateral position from a supine position and determine its effect on the need for DLT repositioning for successful lung separation in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. One hundred eight adult patients requiring one-lung ventilation were randomly divided into group P ( PVC DLT , n = 54) and group S ( Silicone DLT , n = 54). The position of the DLT was observed before and after lateral positioning to assess the effect of the position change. The incidence of clinically significant displacement ( > 10 mm) of DLT was compared between the groups. DLTs were clinically significantly displaced in group P ( 17/48 , 35.4 %) and group S ( 18/52 , 34.6 %) after lateral positioning ( p = 0.933). A proximal displacement ( 31.3 % ( group P) and 25.0 % ( group S)) was more common than distal displacement ( 4.2 % ( group P) and 9.6 % ( group S)) , with no significant intergroup difference ( p = 0.494). After lateral positioning , critical malposition of DLT with bronchial herniation to the right main bronchus was 8.3 % ( group P) and 7.9 % ( group S , p = 0.906). Left-sided PVC and silicone DLTs produced comparable incidences of clinically significant displacement and , consequently , required similar rates of repositioning for successful lung separation after lateral positioning.
