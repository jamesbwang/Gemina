  In this work , a novel photothermal agent based on methionine ( Met) was synthesized , which shows strong absorbance in the near infrared ray ( NIR) region and is available for NIR imaging and in vivo photothermal therapy in a mouse model. Comparing to free IR-782 , the obtained Met modified fluorescent dye ( Met-IR-782) exhibited excellent fluorescence stability , preferable photothermal conversion efficiency under 780 nm laser irradiation and specific targeting to MCF7 ( human breast adenocarcinoma cell line) cells. The fluorescence imaging ability enabled in situ monitoring of the tumor accumulation of Met-IR-782. The photothermal cytotoxicity assays in vitro and photothermal therapy treatments in vivo indicated that Met-IR-782 could efficiently target and suppress the growth of MCF7 xenograft tumors. Hence , Met-IR-782 is a potential fluorescent agent for NIR imaging-guided cancer photothermal therapy in clinical application. This work highlights the prospect of using light absorbing agents for NIR imaging-guided photothermal therapy.
