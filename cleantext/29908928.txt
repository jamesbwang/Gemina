  Control of independent digital flexion and extension has remained an elusive goal in myoelectric prosthetics for upper extremity amputees. We first performed a cadaver study to determine the feasibility of transferring the interossei muscles for each digit to the dorsum of the hand without damaging the neurovascular pedicles. Once this capability was ensured , a clinical case was performed transferring the interossei of the middle and ring fingers to the dorsum of the hand where they could serve as a myoelectric signal for a partial hand amputee to allow individual digital control with a myoelectric prosthesis. Before surgery , it was impossible to detect an independent signal for each interossei; however , after the surgery , signals were reliably detected , which allowed these muscles<symptom> to serve as myosites for finger flexion using a myoelectric prosthesis and move each digit independently. This concept of salvaging innervated and perfused muscles from an amputated part and transferring them into the more proximal and superficial portion of a salvaged limb has broad applications for improved myoelectric prosthetic control.
