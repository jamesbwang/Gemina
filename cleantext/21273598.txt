  Marine organisms such as corals , sponges and tunicates produce active molecules which could represent a valid starting point for new drug development processes. Among the various structural classes , the attention has been focused on 2,2-bis ( 6-bromo-3-indolyl) ethylamine , a marine alkaloid which showed a good anticancer activity against several tumor cell lines. Here , for the first time , the mechanisms of action of 2,2-bis ( 6-bromo-3-indolyl) ethylamine have been evaluated in a U937 tumor cell model. Morpho-functional and molecular analyses , highlighting its preferred signaling pathway , demonstrated that apoptosis is the major death response induced by this marine compund. Chromatin condensation , micronuclei formation , blebbing and in situ DNA fragmentation , occurring through caspase activation ( extrinsic and intrinsic pathways) , were observed. In particular , the bisindole alkaloid induces a mitochondrial involvement in apoptosis machinery activation with Blc-2/ Bcl-x down-regulation and Bax up-regulation. These findings demonstrated that 2,2-bis ( 6-bromo-3-indolyl) ethylamine alkaloid-induced apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl-2 protein family upstream of caspase activation.
