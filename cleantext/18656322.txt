  Physicians and medical students are generally poor-self assessors. Research suggests that this inaccuracy in self-assessment differs by gender among medical students whereby females underestimate their performance compared to their male counterparts. However , whether this gender difference in self-assessment is observable in low-stakes scenarios remains unclear. Our study 's objective was to determine whether self-assessment differed between male and female medical students when compared to peer-assessment in a low-stakes objective structured clinical examination. Thirty-three ( 15 males , 18 females) third-year students participated in a 5-station mock objective structured clinical examination. Trained fourth-year student examiners scored their performance on a 6-point Likert-type global rating scale. Examinees also scored themselves using the same scale. To examine gender differences in medical students ' self-assessment abilities , mean self-assessment global rating scores were compared with peer-assessment global rating scores using an independent samples t test. Overall , female students ' self-assessment scores were significantly lower compared to peer-assessment ( p < 0.001) , whereas no significant difference was found between self- and peer-assessment scores for male examinees ( p = 0.228). This study provides further evidence that underestimation in self-assessment among females is observable even in a low-stakes formative objective structured clinical examination facilitated by fellow medical students.
