  In response to iron deficiency , the budding yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> undergoes a metabolic remodeling in order to optimize iron utilization. The tandem zinc finger ( TZF)- containing protein Cth2 plays a critical role in this adaptation by binding and promoting the degradation of multiple mRNAs that contain AU-rich elements ( AREs). Here , we demonstrate that Cth2 also functions as a translational repressor of its target mRNAs. By complementary approaches , we demonstrate that Cth2 protein inhibits the translation of SDH4 , which encodes a subunit of succinate dehydrogenase , and CTH2 mRNAs in response to iron depletion. Both the AREs within SDH4 and CTH2 transcripts , and the Cth2 TZF are essential for translational repression. We show that the role played by Cth2 as a negative translational regulator extends to other mRNA targets such as WTM1 , CCP1 and HEM15. A structure-function analysis of Cth2 protein suggests that the Cth2 amino-terminal domain ( NTD) is important for both mRNA turnover and translation inhibition , while its carboxy-terminal domain ( CTD) only participates in the regulation of translation , but is dispensable for mRNA degradation. Finally , we demonstrate that the Cth2 CTD is physiologically relevant for adaptation to iron deficiency.
