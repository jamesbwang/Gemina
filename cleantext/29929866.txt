  The lingual cyst<symptom> with respiratory epithelium , a congenital cyst<symptom> of the tongue or floor of the mouth<symptom> , is lined predominately by respiratory-type epithelium. The terminology for this lesion<symptom> was first proposed in 1999 by Manor et al. , who stated that a descriptive term is best for this cyst<symptom> of debatable pathogenesis. Although it is a cyst<symptom> of foregut origin , the lingual cyst<symptom> with respiratory epithelium is distinguished from the traditional enteric ( foregut) duplication cyst<symptom> in that the latter contains gastric and/or intestinal-type mucosa and has smooth muscle within the cyst<symptom> wall. This article presents 2 new cases of this entity , as well as reviews the 19 cases that have been reported in the literature and were found to fulfill the histologic criteria of an lingual cyst<symptom> with respiratory epithelium.
