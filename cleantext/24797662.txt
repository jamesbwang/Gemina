  Osteoarthritis ( OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by abrasion , and ultimately , destruction of the articular cartilage and trabecular bone loss. OA is still considered a devastating disease , which requires an aggressive therapeutic approach. Despite the therapeutic potential of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( AD-MSCs) , the molecular parameters needed to define the `` stemness '' remain largely unknown. Using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays , the differential gene expression profiles between a fraction of human adipose-derived ( AD) mononuclear cells and its MSC subpopulation were obtained. Of particular interest was a subset of 58 genes preferentially expressed at sevenfold or higher in the group treated with human AD-MSCs. This subset contained numerous genes involved in the inflammatory response , immune response , lipid metabolism , cell death , cell proliferation , and DNA repair. Additionally , four protein networks were constructed. The interaction network consisted of 46 proteins encoded by up-regulated genes. However , the interaction network also consisted of 38 proteins encoded by down-regulated genes. My results provide a basis for a more reproducible and reliable quality control using genotypic analysis for the definition of human AD-MSCs. Therefore , these results will provide a basis for studies on molecular mechanisms controlling the core properties of human MSCs.
