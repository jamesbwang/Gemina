  We investigated the effects of microporous porcine acellular dermal matrices ( MPADM)- containing bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( BMMSCs) on accessory skin cell regeneration in vivo. Two kinds of the porcine acellular dermal matrices were prepared: one with microsized pores ( the MPADM) and another without pores ( the PADM). BMMSC populations from a Sprague-Dawley ( SD) rat were seeded on both PADMs and MPADMs and cultured in vitro for 5 days. These rats were randomly divided into four groups: BMMSCs on an MPADM and covered with a PADM layer ( group A) , MPADM without cells and covered with a split-thickness skin graft ( SSG) ( group B) , BMMSCs on an MPADM and covered with an SSG ( group C) , and BMMSCs on a PADM and covered with an SSG ( group D). On post-surgery day ( PSD) 5 , all groups survived , except for group D. On PSD 7 , there was no significant difference in the functional vascularization between groups A , B , and C. On PSD 14 , large quantities of new capillaries , a larger rough endoplasmic reticulum in fibroblasts , and de novo unmyelinated nerve endings could be observed at the junction between the skin graft and the dermal matrix in group C; however , these structures were absent in groups A and B. The experimental results showed that MPADM could induce exogenous differentiation of BMMSCs in vivo and promote reconstruction of skin accessory cells.
