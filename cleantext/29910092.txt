  Translation and RNA decay , two processes in which all mRNAs are engaged , are intimately related processes. Two new studies demonstrate that , in trypanosomatids , codon usage largely shapes mRNA abundance in a translation-dependent manner. The findings indicate that mRNA decay control by codon choice is an ancient and conserved mechanism.
