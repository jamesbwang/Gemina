  Extracting microanatomical information beyond the image resolution of MRI would provide valuable tools for diagnostics and neuroscientific research. A number of mathematical models already suggest microstructural interpretations of diffusion MRI ( dMRI) data. Examples of such microstructural features could be cell bodies and neurites , e.g. the axon 's diameter or their orientational distribution for global connectivity analysis using tractography , and have previously only been possible to access through conventional histology of post mortem tissue or invasive biopsies. The prospect of gaining the same knowledge non-invasively from the whole living human brain could push the frontiers for the diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric diseases. It could also provide a general understanding of the development and natural variability in the healthy brain across a population. However , due to a limited image resolution , most of the dMRI measures are indirect estimations and may depend on the whole chain from experimental parameter settings to model assumptions and implementation. Here , we review current literature in this field and highlight the integrative work across anatomical length scales that is needed to validate and trust a new dMRI method. We encourage interdisciplinary collaborations and data sharing in regards to applying and developing new validation techniques to improve the specificity of future dMRI methods.
