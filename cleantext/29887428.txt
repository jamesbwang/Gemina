  Despite studies demonstrating the accuracy of smart watches ( SW) and wearable heart rate ( HR) monitors in sinus rhythm , no data exists regarding their utility in arrhythmias. 102 hospitalized patients were evaluated at rest using continuous electrocardiogram ( ECG) monitoring with concomitant SW-HR ( FitBit , FB , Apple Watch , AW) for 30 min. Across all devices , 38,616 HR values were recorded. Sinus rhythm cohort demonstrated strong agreement for both devices with a low bias ( FB & AW Bias = 1 beat). In atrial arrhythmias , AW demonstrated a stronger correlation than FB ( AW r SW demonstrate strong agreement for HR estimation in sinus rhythm and atrial flutter but underestimates HR in AF. Tachycardic episodes recorded at rest on a SW may be suggestive of an underlying atrial tachyarrhythmia and warrant further clinical evaluation.
