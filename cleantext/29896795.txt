  As peripheral lymphocytes are typically excluded from the gastrointestinal lymph tissues , current parenteral vaccinations fail to simultaneously induce systemic and mucosal responses. To break the natural barrier , `` immunoticket '' capsules are developed and heralded , which are designed with positive charged shells and oily core to spatiotemporally deliver antigens and all-trans retinoic acid ( RA). After intramuscular vaccinations , these capsules function as an immunoticket to cultivate peripheral dendritic cells ( DCs) with gut-homing receptors ( CCR9). By hitchhiking on the concentration gradient of the CC-motif chemokine ligand 25 ( CCL25) , the primed DCs would home to the gut associated lymphoid tissues ( GALTs) and induce antigen-specific IgA secretion and T cell engagements. Compared with the currently employed RA-involving formulations , the immunoticket capsules stimulate enhanced RA-mediated gut-tropism by mounting the inflammatory innate immunity. Through controlling the RA payload , the potential regulatory T cell engagement is circumvented. In ovalbumin ( OVA) and EV71 vaccinations , the immunoticket capsules induce potent serum IgG titer and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in the peripheral lymph tissues , as well as robust IgA secretion and T cell engagements on gastrointestinal sites. The data suggest the potential of the immunotickets to serve as a facile , effective , and safe strategy to provide comprehensive immune responses against gastrointestinal<disease> infections<disease> and diseases.
