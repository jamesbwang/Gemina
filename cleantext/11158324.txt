  Hepatocyte nuclear factors ( HNF) are transcription factors that crucially regulate cell-specific gene expression in many tissues , including the liver. Of these factors , HNF4A acts both as a master regulator of liver organogenesis and a tumor suppressor in the liver. In our whole genome sequencing analysis , we found seven somatic mutations ( three Zn-finger mutations , three deletion mutants , and one intron mutation) of
