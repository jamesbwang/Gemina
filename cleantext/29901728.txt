  Asiatic apple leafminer , Phyllonorycter ringoniella ( Matsumura) , is an important insect pest of apple in Northeast Asia. Its larvae mine the leaves and are best managed by targeted sprays. Little is known about its thermal development characteristics , thus , immature P. ringoniella development was investigated under eight constant temperatures ( 13.3 , 15.3 , 20.7 , 23.6 , 26.1 , 30.0 , 32.3 , and 35.0 °C) in the laboratory. The total developmental period of the immature stage ( egg-pupa) was inversely related to temperature and decreased from 76.4 d at 13.3 °C to 25.9 d at 26.1 °C. The developmental periods of eggs , larvae , and pupae ranged from 4.8 to 15.2 , 15.5 to 40.3 , and 5.7 to 21.6 d , respectively. Eggs , larvae , and pupae did not survive at 35.0 °C. According to the ordinary linear model , the lower developmental threshold temperatures for egg , larva , pupa , and total immature stage were estimated as 6.7 , 6.7 , 9.6 , and 7.1 °C , and the thermal constants as 93.5 , 286.5 , 94.6 , and 480.1 degree-days ( DD) , respectively. There were large differences among 11 nonlinear models for estimating lower and upper temperature thresholds , and small differences in estimating optimal temperature. Nonlinear temperature-dependent developmental rates were best represented by Lactin-1 model for egg and Briere-1 model for other stages. Stage transition models from eggs to adults of P. ringoniella were constructed by two-parameter Weibull function with the respective selected nonlinear developmental rate models. This study provides a fundamental understanding of thermal traits of P. ringoniella development which will be a useful tool to predict stage transition and for developing decision-based spray timings for integrated pest management.
