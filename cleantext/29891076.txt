  Although preterm birth is best known to result in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes through injury of the supratentorial structures , including intraventricular hemorrhage<symptom> and periventricular leukomalacia , the cerebellum has become increasingly recognized as an important target for injury and adverse motor and cognitive outcomes. Undergoing the most dramatic growth during the preterm period , the cerebellum is vulnerable to large and small hemorrhages<symptom> , as well as hypoplasia resulting from a number of potentially modifiable risk factors. These factors include contact with intraventricular blood , crossed cerebrocerebellar diaschisis , postnatal glucocorticoid exposure , pain and opioid exposure , nutrition and somatic growth , cardiorespiratory factors , and socioeconomic status. Strategies targeting these factors may result in prevention of the motor and cognitive deficits seen after cerebellar hemorrhage<symptom> or hypoplasia.
