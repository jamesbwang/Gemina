  Colloid cysts<symptom> have been associated with acute neurologic deterioration and sudden death. However , the low incidence of associated sudden deaths has meant that factors influencing outcome in patients who present with acute neurological deterioration have not been extensively published. A PubMed literature search was performed to identify reported patients who presented with acute neurological deterioration with radiographic or histopathologic diagnosis of a colloid cyst<symptom>. Demographic data , presenting symptoms , physical exam , surgical interventions , and outcomes were recorded. Analysis included 140 patients. Mean cyst<symptom> size was 2.12 cm in males and 1.59 cm in females ( p = 0.155) , and 1.64 cm in patients who survived and 2.05 cm in patients who died ( p = 0.04). Minimum cyst<symptom> size was 0.4 cm in females and 0.8 cm in males. All patients without surgical intervention died , versus 48 % with surgical intervention ( p < 0.0001). Patient age was not significantly associated with outcome. Patients with hydrocephalus<symptom> who have symptomatic colloid cysts<symptom> are at extremely high risk for acute neurological deterioration and sudden death. Larger cyst<symptom> size was associated with higher mortality , regardless of intervention. Prompt surgical intervention in extremis can lead to survival in approximately half the patients. Females , even with smaller cyst<symptom> sizes , may be more likely to die before any intervention and may therefore benefit from more aggressive treatment approaches.
