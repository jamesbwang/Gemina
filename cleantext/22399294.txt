  This study was aimed at exploring the effect of lncRNA BDNF-AS on cell proliferation , migration , invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) of oesophageal cancer ( EC) cells. The expression of BDNF-AS and miR-214 in tissue samples and cells was measured by qRT-PCR. The targeted relationship between BDNF-AS and miR-214 was analysed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. After cell transfection , the cell proliferation activity was assessed by MTS method , while the migrating and invading abilities were evaluated by transwell assay. LncRNA BDNF-AS was remarkably down-regulated , while miR-214 was up-regulated in EC tissues and cells in comparison with normal tissues and cells. Overexpression of BDNF-AS significantly inhibited the abilities of cell proliferation , migration and invasion as well as the EMT processes of EC cells. The bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay indicated that BDNF-AS could be directly bound by miR-214. Furthermore , overexpression of miR-214 and BDNF-AS exerted suppressive influence on EC cell multiplication , migration , invasion and EMT processes. LncRNA BDNF-AS restrained cell proliferation , migration , invasion and EMT processes in EC cells by targeting miR-214.
