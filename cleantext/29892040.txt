  Overweight is shown to track ( = to maintain a relative position in a distribution) from childhood to adulthood , but is mostly studied in preobesogenic cohorts and in single ethnic groups. Little is known about tracking of thinness by ethnicity. to determine ( differences in) tracking of BMI ( class) from 3 through 15 years and the prediction of BMI class at 13-15 years of age in contemporary Dutch , Turkish , Moroccan and South Asian children living in the Netherlands. Historical cohort of 7625 children , born 1994-1997 , with 24,376 measurements of BMI. BMI z-score and BMI class was analysed using universal criteria. South Asian children were also assessed using ethnic specific BMI criteria. Diagnostic odds ratios ( OR) and test properties were calculated to estimate the ability of BMI class at 3-4 years to predict BMI class at 13-15 years. Tracking of thinness between 3 and 15 years was stronger than that of overweight , as indicated by a generally higher diagnostic OR. BMI trajectories between 3 and 15 years of age of thin , normal weight and overweight adolescents were , although significantly different , quite similarly shaped in children of Dutch , Turkish and Moroccan descent. The South Asian BMI trajectory deviated considerably from the other ethnic groups , but the differences disappeared when South Asian specific BMI criteria were applied. A substantial proportion of overweight developed between 5-10 years , after which less children shifted to other BMI classes. A total of 55-78 % of children with overweight at 3-4 years retained their overweight at 13-15 years , and 10-20 % of 3-4 year olds with thinness remained thin. In all ethnic groups , overweight and especially thinness highly tracked into adolescence. South Asian children differed from the other ethnic groups when universal BMI criteria were applied , but with South Asian specific BMI criteria tracking patterns became more concordant.
