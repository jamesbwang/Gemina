  Antitumor peptides may potentially alleviate the problem of chemoresistance but do not yet target tumor cells and would be cytotoxic to normal cells. Here , we designed a pH-activated and thermosensitive lipopeptide ( C6-Pep) containing a leucine zipper and an alkyl chain and assessed the ability of C6-Pep to kill cancer cells. Pep , the same sequence without the N-terminal hexanoic acid moiety , was generated as a less hydrophobic control. First , lipopeptide adsorption into lipid monolayers was studied using Langmuir-Blodgett and polarization modulation infrared reflection adsorption spectroscopy. Under weakly acid conditions , electrostatic interactions between C6-Pep and negatively charged phospholipids increased the adsorption/insertion of C6-Pep ( vs Pep) into lipid monolayers. Cargo leakage from liposomes was assayed to model lipopeptide-induced lipid membrane disruption. The ability of C6-Pep to disrupt liposomes depended on the peptide molecular structure/hydrophobicity , solution pH , and temperature-induced uncoiling of the zipper structure; the greatest cargo leakage from the liposome with negative charge was observed for C6-Pep at pH 5.5 under mildly hyperthermic conditions ( 45 °C). In vitro , C6-Pep was significantly more cytotoxic toward HeLa cells at pH 5.5 under hyperthermic conditions than at pH 7.4 and/or 37 °C. Overall , this study demonstrates that amphipathic C6-Pep can insert into cell membranes<symptom> in the low-pH tumor microenvironment , whereas the application of heat promotes the uncoiling of the zipper structure , leading to the disruption of tumor cell membranes<symptom> and cell death. pH-activated and thermosensitive C6-Pep represents a promising tool to kill cancer cells via a strategy that does not invoke chemoresistance and may have low side effects.
