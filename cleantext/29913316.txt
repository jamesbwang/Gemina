  In this dynamic causal modeling ( DCM) study , we evaluated the effect of age on the effective connectivity of a cerebral network involved in lexical production. Younger and older adults performed an object naming task during fMRI. The DCM was used to explore the interactions between four regions of interest: the occipital cortex , OC; the lateral temporal cortex , LTC; the medial temporal cortex , MTC; and the inferior frontal cortex , IFC. We mainly focused on the modulation of the fronto-temporal interaction , according to the hypothesis that aging requires strategies that modulate the access to the semantic knowledge , either through a neural reserve mechanism ( increased MTC-LTC connectivity) or through a neural compensation mechanism ( supplementary IFC-MTC connectivity). For younger adults , our results indicated a bi-directional interaction between the left IFC and LTC suggesting a typical activation related to lexico-semantic representations. For older adults , our results reveal the existence of bi-directional interaction between the IFC and MTC , but not between the IFC and LTC- which in turn suggests that older adults adapt a new strategy , via supplemental access to conceptual access and semantic retrieval processes. This neural compensation strategy would be facilitated by a top-down mechanism from the IFC to the MTC. We discuss our results in the context of the possible additional strategies used by older compared to younger adults , to retrieve and produce words.
