  This study sought to compare short- and long-term outcomes of drug-eluting stents ( DESs) versus bare-metal stents ( BMSs) implantation in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ( ESRD-HD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). Adult patients with ESRD-HD who underwent PCI at all nonfederal hospitals in Massachusetts between July 1 , 2003 , and September 30 , 2007 , were stratified based on the stent type placed at index hospitalization: DES or BMS. The primary outcome compared was a composite of all-cause death , myocardial infarction ( MI) , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) , target vessel revascularization ( TVR) , and stroke at 30 days and one year. HD patients had a high mortality ( 31 %) and were more likely to receive a DES than a BMS ( 77 % versus 23 %). Propensity score analysis of 2: 1 matched DES ( 268) versus BMS ( 134) patients demonstrated the DES group to more likely have proximal LAD disease and a history of prior PCI. Conditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the composite cardiovascular endpoint measured at 30 days ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.09; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.61-1.94) and one year ( HR 1.03; 95 % CI 0.68-1.57). There were no significant differences in 30-day or 1-year major cardiovascular outcomes in HD patients undergoing PCI using the DES compared to the BMS in this high-mortality patient cohort.
