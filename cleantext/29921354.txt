  Understanding human behavior under the effects of sleep deprivation allows for the mitigation of risk due to reduced performance. To further this goal , this study investigated the effects of short-term sleep deprivation using a tilt-based control device and examined whether existing user models accurately predict targeting performance. A task in which the user tilts a surface to roll a ball into a target was developed to examine motor performance. A model was built to predict human performance for this task under various levels of sleep deprivation. Every 2 h , 10 subjects completed the task until they reached 24 h of wakefulness. Performance measurements of this task , which were based on Fitts ' law , included movement time , task throughput , and time intercept. The model predicted significant performance decrements over the 24-h period with an increase in movement time ( R2 = 0.61) , a decrease in throughput ( R2 = 0.57) , and an increase in time intercept ( R2 = 0.60). However , it was found that in experimental trials there was no significant change in movement time ( R2 = 0.11) , throughput ( R2 = 0.15) , or time intercept ( R2 = 0.27). The results found were unexpected as performance decrement is frequently reported during sleep deprivation. These findings suggest a reexamination of the initial thought of sleep loss leading to a decrement in all aspects of performance.Bolkovsky JB , Ritter FE , Chon KH , Qin M.
