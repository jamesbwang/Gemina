  Açai ( Euterpe oleracea Mart.) fruit from the Amazon region in Brazil contains bioactive compounds such as α-tocopherol , anthocyanins ( cyanidin 3-glycoside and cyanidin 3-rutinoside) , and other flavonoids with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover , the prebiotic activity of anthocyanins in modulating the composition of gut microbiota has emerged as an additional mechanism by which anthocyanins exert health-promoting effects. Açai consumption may be a nutritional therapeutic strategy for chronic kidney disease ( CKD) patients since these patients present with oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , and dysbiosis. However , the ability of açai to modulate these conditions has not been studied in CKD , and this review presents recent information about açai and its possible therapeutic effects in CKD.
