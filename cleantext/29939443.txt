  The cavities of metallosupramolecular cages can be used to mimic the central spaces of naturally occurring proteins and bind a wide variety of molecular guests. A range of potential applications have arisen from this capacity for host-guest chemistry. However , to truly harness the opportunities thus afforded , methodologies to controllably allow the release and reuptake of guests from the cavities of metallosupramolecular cages are required. Methods to accomplish this have centered upon reversibly altering the character of either the guest or host. This minireview outlines the current approaches used to carry out the binding and release of guests from metallosupramolecular hosts using important examples from the field.
