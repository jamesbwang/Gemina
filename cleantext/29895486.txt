  Pulmonary hypertension secondary to left heart disease ( WHO Group 2) is a known risk factor in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The favourable effect of left ventricular assist devices ( LVAD) on pulmonary hypertension has been demonstrated before , although this effect has not been well-studied in advanced pulmonary arterial bed disease with a significant elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance. We reviewed the records of 258 LVAD patients in our institution. Patients with elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure ( mPAP > 25mmHg) and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ≥ 3 Wood units) were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups based on their baseline PVR ( PVR = 3-5 Wood units ( WU) vs. PVR > 5WU). The groups were studied for the changes in their pulmonary haemodynamics after the placement of LVAD. Fifty-one patients were included in the study. All patients showed a significant improvement in their pulmonary haemodynamic parameters post LVAD placement. In the group with the higher PVR , mPAP dropped from a baseline of 43 ± 7mmHg to 22 ± 6mmHg post LVAD placement ( p < 0.001) , while PVR dropped from 6.3 ± 1.2 Wood units to 2.2 ± 1.1 Wood units ( p < 0.001). In a subgroup of patients who underwent cardiac transplantation post LVAD ( n = 14) , all patients maintained a normalised PVR ( < 3WU) one year post cardiac transplantation. Left ventricular assist devices can reverse pulmonary hypertension WHO Group 2 with significantly elevated PVR; this effect is not dependent on the baseline PVR , and is maintained up to one year post cardiac transplantation.
