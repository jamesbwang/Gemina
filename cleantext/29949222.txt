  Developing new drug delivery carriers addressing chemoresistance is still full of challenges and opportunities. As the rapid development of small interfering RNA ( siRNA) provides promising therapeutic perspectives , nanocarriers for drug and siRNA co-delivery present new alternatives for cancer therapy. A co-delivery nanosystem for methotrexate ( MTX) or gamma-glutamylated derivatives ( gE Almost 100 % MTX derivative incorporation was achieved in gE A new strategy for co-delivering negatively charged MTX and cytotoxic siRNA has been developed by utilizing sequence defined cationic lipo-oligomers. Mediated by the combined effect of antifolate MTX , antimitotic EG5 siRNA and EGFR targeting by GE11 , superior tumor cell killing was obtained with GE11 gE
