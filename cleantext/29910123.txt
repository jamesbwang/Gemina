  Exercise-induced desaturation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) frequently has prognostic implications. Desaturation within the first minute of the walk 6-minute walk test will probably also occur in daily life activities and translate into hypoxaemic respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> at rest in later years. This study aimed at comparing these patients with those who desaturate after the first minute and determine potential markers. We conducted a cross-sectional , retrospective study collecting data on respiratory function tests , cardiovascular comorbidity , body mass index , pack-year index , 6-minute walk test outcomes , BODE index , and Charlson comorbidity index. Patients who desaturated during the first minute of the test were referred to as early desaturators compared to the non-early ones. We observed a higher mean body mass index in early desaturating patients , and an inverse relation as to the body mass index categories < 25 , 25-29 , and â‰¥ 30. Early desaturators had a lower FEV Overweight and obesity , as determined by body mass index , seem to behave like markers for early desaturation. This simple anthropometric measure might indicate point to potential early desaturation in COPD patients.
