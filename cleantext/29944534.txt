  Skeletal reconstruction of segmental defects of the appendicular skeleton is among the most challenging tasks in reconstructive surgery. A popular method of reconstruction of large osseous defects is the combination of massive allografts and vascularized bone transfer. We present and discuss our experience with a modification of the traditional Capanna technique in which the allograft is split in half longitudinally to provide for more space for postoperative fibula hypertrophy. Patients who underwent reconstruction of segmental intercalary defects of the tibia using our modified technique were retrospectively identified. The following parameters were retrieved: patient age , race , sex , length of skeletal defect , recipient vessels , type of microsurgical anastomosis , union rate , complication rate , ambulation ( yes/no) , and follow-up ( in months). Two male patients underwent reconstruction of the tibia via the modified `` hemi-Capanna '' technique. The tibia defect measured 12 and 13 cm , respectively. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were encountered. Osseous union was obtained in both patients who are both ambulatory. The hemi-Capanna technique not only leaves more room for hypertrophy of the vascularized fibula , but also simplifies the technique of combining an allograft with vascularized bone transfer in reconstructions of segmental skeletal defects of the appendicular skeleton.
