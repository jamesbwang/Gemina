  The primary purpose of this study was to investigate gender differences in the dynamic strength index ( DSI): an assessment of upper-body dynamic strength relative to maximal isometric strength. The secondary purpose was to investigate gender differences in the dynamic skill deficit ( DSD): an assessment of sports-specific dynamic strength relative to maximal isometric strength , and its association with a sports-specific performance measure in surfers. Nine male ( age = 30.3 ± 7.3 yrs) and eight female ( age = 25.5 ± 5.2 yrs) surfers undertook three upper-body assessments: isometric push-up , dynamic push-up , and a force plate pop-up to determine the DSI and DSD. The performance measure of time taken to pop-up ( TTP) was recorded. No gender differences for the DSI (
