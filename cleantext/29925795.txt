  The hybrid peptide cecropin A ( 1 ⁻ 8) ⁻ LL37 ( 17 ⁻ 30) ( C ⁻ L) , derived from the sequence of cecropin A ( C) and LL-37 ( L) , showed significantly increased antibacterial activity and minimized hemolytic activity than C and L alone. To obtain high-level production of C ⁻ L , the deoxyribonucleic acid sequence encoding C ⁻ L with preferred codons was cloned into pET-SUMO to construct a fusion expression vector , and overexpressed in
