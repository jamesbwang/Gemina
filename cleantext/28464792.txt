  MicroRNAs ( miRNA) are key modulators of gene expression and so act as putative fine-tuners of complex phenotypes. Here , we hypothesized that causal variants of complex traits are enriched in miRNAs and miRNA-target networks. First , we conducted a genome-wide association study ( GWAS) for seven functional and milk<symptom> production<symptom> traits using imputed sequence variants ( 13 ~ 15 million) and > 10,000 animals from three dairy cattle breeds , i.e. , Holstein ( HOL) , Nordic red cattle ( RDC) and Jersey ( JER). Second , we analyzed for enrichments of association signals in miRNAs and their miRNA-target networks. Our results demonstrated that genomic regions harboring miRNA genes were significantly ( P < 0.05) enriched with GWAS signals for milk<symptom> production<symptom> traits and mastitis<symptom> , and that enrichments within miRNA-target gene networks were significantly higher than in random gene-sets for the majority of traits. Furthermore , most between-trait and across-breed correlations of enrichments with miRNA-target networks were significantly greater than with random gene-sets , suggesting pleiotropic effects of miRNAs. Intriguingly , genes that were differentially expressed in response to mammary gland infections were significantly enriched in the miRNA-target networks associated with mastitis<symptom>. All these findings were consistent across three breeds. Collectively , our observations demonstrate the importance of miRNAs and their targets for the expression of complex traits.
