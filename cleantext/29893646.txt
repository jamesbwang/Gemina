  Purpose To evaluate the utility of amide proton transfer ( APT) imaging in the characterization of head and neck tumors. Materials and Methods This retrospective study of APT imaging included 117 patients with 70 nasopharyngeal undifferentiated carcinomas ( NUCs) , 26 squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs) , eight non-Hodgkin lymphomas ( NHLs) , and 13 benign salivary gland tumors ( BSGTs). Normal tissues were examined in 25 patients. The APT means of malignant tumors , normal tissues , and benign tumors were calculated and compared with the Student t test and analysis of variance. The added value of the mean APT to the mean apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) for differentiating malignant and benign tumors was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic analysis and integrated discrimination index. Results The mean APT of malignant tumors ( 2.40 % ± 0.97 ( standard deviation)) was significantly higher than that of brain tissue ( 1.13 % ± 0.43) , muscle tissue ( 0.23 % ± 0.73) , and benign tumors ( 1.32 % ± 1.20) ( P < .001). There were no differences between malignant groups ( NUC , 2.37 % ± 0.90; SCC , 2.41 % ± 1.16; NHL , 2.65 % ± 0.89; P = .45 to P = .86). The mean ADC of malignant tumors ( ( 0.85 ± 0.17) × 10
