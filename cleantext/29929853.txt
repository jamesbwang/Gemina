US federal funding agencies , including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute , the National Institutes of Health , and the Food and Drug Administration have recognized the EHR 's role supporting research. The main approached to using EHR data include enhanced lists , direct data extraction , structured data entry , and unstructured data entry. The EHR 's potential to facilitate research , overcoming cost and time burdens associated with traditional data collection , has not resulted in widespread use of EHR-based research tools. There are strengths and weaknesses<symptom> for all existing methodologies of using EHR data to support research. Collaboration is needed to identify the method that best suits the institution for incorporation of research-oriented data collection into routine pediatric urologic clinical practice.
