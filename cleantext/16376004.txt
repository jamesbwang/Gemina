  Paediatric trigger finger ( PTF) is a rare condition as seen by the lack of studies published about paediatric populations. Due to this general lack of information , the steps to employ to correct this disorder , whether surgically or non-surgically , have not yet reached consensus status. The objective of this study is to review the published literature regarding treatment options for PTF in order to develop a proposed step-wise treatment algorithm for children presenting with trigger finger. A systematic review of the literature was conducted on PubMed to locate English language studies reporting on treatment interventions of PTF. Data was collected on number of patients/fingers seen in the study , the category of the fingers involved , the number of patients/fingers undergoing each intervention and reported outcomes. Seven articles reporting on 118 trigger fingers were identified. In all , 64 fingers were treated non-surgically , with 57.8 % ( 37/64) resolving. In all , 54 fingers were initially surgically treated , with 87 % ( 47/54) resolving. In total , 34 fingers did not have resolution of symptoms following primary treatment , and 27 fingers received follow-up treatment , with 92.6 % ( 25/27) resolving. Overall , 92.4 % ( 109/118) of fingers achieved resolution of symptoms after all treatments were completed. Limitations for this study included few prospective studies and small sample sizes. This is likely due to the rarity of PTF. This review of the literature indicated that a step-wise approach , including non-operative and surgical techniques , should be employed in the management of PTF. This work meets the requirements of the PRISMA guidelines ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses).
