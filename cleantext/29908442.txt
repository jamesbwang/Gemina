  Despite the fact that the benzomorphan skeleton has mainly been employed in medicinal chemistry for the development of opioid analgesics , it is a versatile structure. Its stereochemistry , as well as opportune modifications at the phenolic hydroxyl group and at the basic nitrogen , play a pivotal role addressing the benzomorphan-based compounds to a specific target. In this review , we describe the structure activity-relationships ( SARs<pathogen>) of benzomorphan-based compounds acting at sigma 1 receptor ( σ1R) , sigma 2 receptor ( σ2R) , voltage-dependent sodium channel , N-Methyl-d-Aspartate ( NMDA) receptor-channel complex and other targets. Collectively , the SARs<pathogen> data have highlighted that the benzomorphan nucleus could be regarded as a useful template for the synthesis of drug candidates for different targets.
