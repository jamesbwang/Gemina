  The genus Beroe Browne , 1756 ( Ctenophora , Beroidae) occurs worldwide , with 25 currently-described species. Because the genus is poorly studied , the definitive number of species is uncertain. Recently , a possible new Beroe species was suggested based on internal transcribed spacer 1 ( ITS1) sequences from samples collected in Svalbard , Norway. Another species , Beroe ovata , was introduced to Europe from North<pathogen> America , initially in the Black Sea and subsequently ( and possibly secondarily) into the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. In areas where ctenophores have been introduced , they have often had significant detrimental ecological effects. The potential for other cryptic and/or undescribed Beroe species and history of spread of some species in the genus give reason for additional study. When alive , morphological hallmarks may be challenging to spot and photograph owing to the animals ' transparency and near-constant motion. We sampled and analyzed 109 putative Beroe specimens from Europe , using morphological and molecular approaches. DNA analyses were conducted using cytochrome oxidase 1 and internal transcribed spacer sequences and , together with published sequences from GenBank , phylogenetic relationships of the genus were explored. Our study suggests the presence of at least 5 genetic lineages of Beroe in Europe , of which 3 could be assigned to known species: Beroe gracilis KÃ¼nne 1939; Beroe cucumis Fabricius , 1780; and Beroe ovata sensu Mayer , 1912. The other 2 lineages ( here provisionally named Beroe `` norvegica '' and Beroe `` anatoliensis '') did not clearly coincide with any known species and might therefore reflect new species , but confirmation of this requires further study.
