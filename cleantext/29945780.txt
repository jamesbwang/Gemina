  Serum creatine kinase ( CK) levels are higher after eccentric , muscle-damaging exercise in statin-treated patients. This could contribute to the increased statin-associated muscle<symptom> symptoms<symptom> reported in physically active individuals. We tested the hypothesis in this pilot study that creatine ( Cr) monohydrate supplementation would reduce the CK response to eccentric exercise in patients using statins to determine if Cr supplementation could be a strategy to mitigate statin-associated muscle<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in physically active individuals. Healthy , nonsmoking men ( n = 5) and women ( n = 14) were randomized to Cr monohydrate = atorvastatin 80 mg + 10 g Cr monohydrate ( n = 10 , age = 60 ± 7 years) or to placebo ( PL) = atorvastatin 80 mg + PL ( n = 9 , age = 52 ± 6 years). After 4 weeks of treatment , subjects performed 45 minutes of eccentric exercise ( downhill walking at a -15 % grade). Serum CK levels , muscle<symptom> soreness<symptom> ( visual analog scale after two squats) , and muscle<symptom> pain<symptom> severity and interference ( using the brief pain inventory) were measured before and after 4 weeks of treatment , and then for 4 consecutive days after downhill walking. Vitamin D , or serum 25 ( OH) D , was also measured at baseline. The PL group was younger ( P = .01) but not otherwise different in blood lipids , vitamin D , CK , muscle visual analog scale , and pain scores before ( all P > .21) or after ( all P > .12) treatment. CK increased in all subjects after downhill walking ( P < .01) , but neither the relative peak change ( expressed as group mean difference with 95 % confidence intervals: 43.52 % ( -196.41 , 283.45)) nor the absolute peak change ( 67.38 U/L ( -121.55 , 256.31)) relative to baseline was different between groups ( P = .46 and .71 , respectively). A similar lack of treatment effect was observed for muscle<symptom> soreness<symptom> ( 11.03 mm ( -9.49 , 31.55)) , pain severity ( 0.77 pts ( -0.95 , 2.50)) , and pain interference ( 1.02 pts ( -1.25 , 3.29)) with P-values for group comparisons = 0.27 , 0.36 , and 0.35 , respectively. However , subjects with `` insufficient '' Vitamin D < 30 ng/mL ( n = 10) had an ∼ 2-fold greater CK increase with eccentric exercise ( nominal P-value = .04) than subjects with higher vitamin D levels. Cr monohydrate did not reduce CK increases after exercise in statin-treated subjects. We did observe that low vitamin D levels are associated with a greater CK response to eccentric exercise in statin-treated subjects.
