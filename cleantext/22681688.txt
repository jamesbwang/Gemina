  Antipsychotics are the most widely used medications for the treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. While such drugs generally ameliorate positive symptoms , clinical responses are highly variable in terms of negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. However , predictors of individual responses have been elusive. Here , we report a pharmacogenetic interaction related to a core cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. We show that genetic variations reducing dysbindin-1 expression can identify individuals whose executive functions respond better to antipsychotic drugs , both in humans and in mice. Multilevel ex vivo and in vivo analyses in postmortem human brains and genetically modified mice demonstrate that such interaction between antipsychotics and dysbindin-1 is mediated by an imbalance between the short and long isoforms of dopamine D2 receptors , leading to enhanced presynaptic D2 function within the prefrontal cortex. These findings reveal one of the pharmacodynamic mechanisms underlying individual cognitive response to treatment in patients with schizophrenia , suggesting a potential approach for improving the use of antipsychotic drugs.
