  In our previous study , we have proposed a three-stage model of emotion processing; in the current study , we investigated whether the ERP component may be different when the emotional content of stimuli is task-irrelevant. In this study , a dual-target rapid serial visual presentation ( RSVP) task was used to investigate how the emotional content of words modulates the time course of neural dynamics. Participants performed the task in which affectively positive , negative , and neutral adjectives were rapidly presented while event-related potentials ( ERPs) were recorded from 18 undergraduates. The N170 component was enhanced for negative words relative to positive and neutral words. This indicates that automatic processing of negative information occurred at an early perceptual processing stage. In addition , later brain potentials such as the late positive potential ( LPP) were only enhanced for positive words in the 480-580-ms post-stimulus window , while a relatively large amplitude signal was elicited by positive and negative words between 580 and 680 ms. These results indicate that different types of emotional content are processed distinctly at different time windows of the LPP , which is in contrast with the results of studies on task-relevant emotional processing. More generally , these findings suggest that a negativity bias to negative words remains to be found in emotion-irrelevant tasks , and that the LPP component reflects dynamic separation of emotion valence.
