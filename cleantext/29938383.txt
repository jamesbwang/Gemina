  A new methodology is proposed for sizing the required infrastructures for water and waste load allocation in river systems receiving return flow from agricultural networks. A nonlinear optimization model with a constraint based on conditional value at risk ( CVaR) is developed to provide water and waste load allocation policies. The CVaR-based constraint limits the probabilistic losses due to existing uncertainties in available surface water. The deep uncertainties of return flow simulation model parameters , which have significant impacts on the simulated quantity and quality of agricultural return flows , are handled by using the info-gap theory. Total dissolved solid ( TDS) is selected as water quality indicator and diverting a fraction of return flows to evaporation ponds is considered to control the TDS load of agricultural waste load dischargers. Quantity and TDS load of agricultural return flows over a 1-year cultivation period are simulated by using a calibrated SWAP agro-hydrological model. The results of many runs of SWAP model for different combinations of important uncertain parameters in their ranges of variations provide some response ( impact) matrixes which are used in optimization model. The applicability of the proposed methodology is illustrated by applying it to the PayePol region in the Karkheh River catchment , southwest Iran. The selected strategy for water and waste load allocation in the study area is expected to provide total annual benefit of 48.64 million US dollars , while 7.84 million m
