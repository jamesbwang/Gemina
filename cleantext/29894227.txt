  This review summarizes progress in the fabrication , modification , characterization , and applications of nanopipettes since 2010. A brief history of nanopipettes is introduced , and the details of fabrication , modification , and characterization of nanopipettes are provided. Applications of nanopipettes in chemical analysis are the focus in several cases , including recent progress in imaging; in the study of single molecules , single nanoparticles , and single cells; in fundamental investigations of charge transfer ( ion and electron) reactions at liquid/liquid interfaces; and as hyphenated techniques combined with other methods to study the mechanisms of complicated electrochemical reactions and to conduct bioanalysis.
