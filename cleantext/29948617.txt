  The histone acetylation modifications ( HAMs) influence a large number of cellular functions. They are mediated through histone acetyltransferase ( HAT) and histone deacetylase ( HDAC). Nowadays , people have realized that HAMs are crucial for development and prognosis of breast cancer. Investigations about abnormal HAMs in breast cancer focus on initiating molecular mechanisms in breast cancer development , identification of new biomarkers to predict breast cancer aggressiveness and the therapeutic potential. As HAMs are reversible , breast cancer may be treated by restoring HAMs to normal levels. Indeed , some HDAC inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat certain cancers. Furthermore , HAT inhibitors , HAT activators and HDAC activators may also be used as drugs to treat breast cancer.
