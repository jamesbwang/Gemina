  Penicisteroid C , a new polyoxygenated steroid was isolated from co-cultivation of Streptomyces<pathogen> piomogenus AS63D and Aspergillus<pathogen> niger using solid-state fermentation on rice medium. Additional diverse eleven known metabolites were identified: Fumigaclavine C , fumiquinazoline C , physcion , methylsulochrin , methyllinoleate , glycerol linoleate , cerebroside A , thymine , adenine , thymidine and adenosine. The structure of penicisteroid C was determined by HRESIMS , 1D and 2D NMR data. The antimicrobial and in vitro cytotoxic activities of the microbial extract and penicisteroid C were reported as well.
