  Citations are widely used for measuring scientific impact. The goal of the present study was to predict citation counts of manuscripts submitted to Transplant International ( TI) in the two calendar years following publication. We considered a comprehensive set of 21 manuscript , author , and peer-review-related predictor variables available early in the peer-review process. We also evaluated how successfully the peer-review process at TI identified and accepted the most promising manuscripts for publication. A developed predictive model with nine selected variables showed acceptable test performance to identify often cited articles ( AUROC = 0.685). Particularly important predictors were the number of pages , month of publication , publication type ( review versus other) , and study on humans ( yes versus no). Accepted manuscripts at TI were cited more often than rejected but elsewhere published manuscripts ( median 4 vs. 2 citations). The predictive model did not outperform the actual editorial decision. Both findings suggest that the peer-review process at TI , in its current form , was successful in selecting submitted manuscripts with a high scientific impact in the future. Predictive models might have the potential to support the review process when decisions are made under great uncertainty.
