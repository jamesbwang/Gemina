  Fanconi anemia<symptom> ( FA) genes play important roles in spermatogenesis. In mice , disruption of Fancm impairs male fertility and testicular integrity , but whether FANCM pathogenic variants ( PV) similarly affect fertility in men is unknown. Here we characterize a Pakistani family having three infertile brothers , two manifesting oligoasthenospermia and one exhibiting azoospermia , born to first-cousin parents. A homozygous PV in FANCM ( c. 1946_1958del , p.P648Lfs * 16) was found cosegregating with male infertility<symptom>. Our objective is to validate that FANCM p.P648Lfs * 16 is the PV causing infertility<symptom> in this family. Exome and Sanger sequencing were used for PV screening. DNA interstrand crosslink ( ICL) sensitivity was assessed in lymphocytes from patients. A mouse model carrying a PV nearly equivalent to that in the patients ( Fancm The loss-of-function FANCM PV increased ICL sensitivity in lymphocytes of patients and Fancm These findings revealed male infertility<symptom> to be a novel phenotype of human patients with a biallelic FANCM PV.
