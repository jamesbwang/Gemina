  The manufacturing of insensitive munition 2,4-dinitroanisole ( DNAN) generates waste streams that require treatment. DNAN has been treated previously with zero-valent iron ( ZVI) and Fe-based bimetals. Use of Mg-based bimetals offers certain advantages including potential higher reactivity and relative insensitivity to pH conditions. This work reports preliminary findings of DNAN degradation by three Mg-based bimetals: Mg/Cu , Mg/Ni , and Mg/Zn. Treatment of DNAN by all three bimetals is highly effective in aqueous solutions ( > 89 % removal) and wastewater ( > 91 % removal) in comparison with treatment solely with zero-valent magnesium ( ZVMg; 35 % removal). Investigation of reaction byproducts supports a partial degradation pathway involving reduction of the ortho or para nitro to amino group , leading to 2-amino-4-nitroanisole ( 2-ANAN) and 4-amino-2-nitroanisole ( 4-ANAN). Further reduction of the second nitro group leads to 2,4-diaminoanisole ( DAAN). These byproducts are detected in small quantities in the aqueous phase. Carbon mass balance<symptom> analysis suggests near-complete closure ( 91 %) with 12.4 and 78.4 % of the total organic carbon ( TOC) distributed in the aqueous and mineral bimetal phases , respectively. Post-treatment surface mineral phase analysis indicates Mg ( OH)
