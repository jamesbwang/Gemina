  Viruses<pathogen> are serious pathogenic contamination that severely affect the environment and human health. Cold atmospheric-pressure plasma efficiently inactivates pathogenic bacteria , however , the mechanism of virus inactivation by plasma is not fully understood. In this study , surface plasma in argon mixed with 1 % air and plasma-activated water were used to treat water containing bacteriophages. Both agents efficiently inactivated bacteriophages T4 , Î¦174 , and MS2 in a time-dependent manner. Prolonged storage had marginal effects on the anti-viral activity of plasma-activated water. DNA and protein analysis revealed that the reactive species generated by plasma damaged both nucleic acid and proteins , in consistent with the morphological examination showing that plasma treatment caused the aggregation of bacteriophages. The inactivation of bacteriophages was alleviated by the singlet oxygen scavengers , demonstrating that singlet oxygen played a primary role in this process. Our findings provide a potentially effective disinfecting strategy to combat the environmental viruses using cold atmospheric-pressure plasma and plasma-activated water.
