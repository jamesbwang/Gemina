  Recent evidence shows how an extensive gaming experience might positively impact cognitive and perceptual functioning , leading to brain structural changes observed in cross-sectional studies. Importantly , changes seem to be game-specific , reflecting gameplay styles and therefore opening to the possibility of tailoring videogames according to rehabilitation and enhancement purposes. However , whether if such brain effects can be induced even with limited gaming experience , and whether if they can outlast the gaming period , is still unknown. Here we quantified both cognitive and grey matter thickness changes following 15 daily gaming sessions based on a modified version of a 3D first-person shooter ( FPS) played in laboratory settings. Twenty-nine healthy participants were randomly assigned to a control or a gaming group and underwent a cognitive assessment , an in-game performance evaluation and structural magnetic resonance imaging before ( T0) , immediately after ( T1) and three months after the end of the experiment ( T2). At T1 , a significant increase in thickness of the bilateral parahippocampal cortex ( PHC) , somatosensory cortex ( S1) , superior parietal lobule ( SPL) and right insula were observed. Changes in S1 matched the hand representation bilaterally , while PHC changes corresponded to the parahippocampal place area ( PPA). Surprisingly , changes in thickness were still present at T2 for S1 , PHC , SPL and right insula as compared to T0. Finally , surface-based regression identified the lingual gyrus as the best predictor of changes in game performance at T1. Results stress the specific impact of core game elements , such as spatial navigation and visuomotor coordination on structural brain properties , with effects outlasting even a short intensive gaming period.
