  This study aimed to determine the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviours , sequelae and associated factors in young people attending a youth mental health service. The study design was a cross-sectional survey of 103 young people aged between 15-25 years carried out across four specialist mental health clinics. A questionnaire on the sexual health of secondary level students was adapted for this study. Mental health symptomatology was assessed through the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS). The mean age was 20.9 ( SD ± 2.8) years , with 50.5 % being female , 41.7 % male and 7.7 % transgender. A total of 52.4 % ( N = 54) attended the psychosis ( EPPIC) clinic; 15.6 % ( N = 16) attended the ultra-high risk for psychosis ( PACE) clinic; 19.4 % ( N = 20) attended the personality disorders ( HYPE) clinic; and 12.6 % ( N = 13) attended the mood clinic ( YMC). The mean BPRS score was 47.7 ( SD ± 12.2). A total of 77.7 % of young people had previously been sexually active and of these , 37.5 % did not use consistent contraception; 26.3 % had been pregnant , of which 95.2 % were unplanned. A total of 68.8 % reported having been tested for sexually transmitted infections and 25.5 % tested positive. The severity of symptoms or clinical characteristics were not associated with engagement in high-risk sexual behaviours. These results indicate that young people with mental health disorders have high needs in regard to their sexual health , which could be addressed by incorporating sexual health referral pathways into early intervention services.
