  One of the side effects of bariatric surgery is the risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Vitamin B12 , vitamin D , folate , and iron deficiencies are especially common among Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients. To examine the effectiveness of a specialized multivitamin supplement for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients on deficiencies the first 3 years postoperatively , retrospectively in a large , prospectively collected cohort. Large specialized bariatric hospital. One thousand one hundred sixty patients were included , 883 users and 258 who were nonusers of the specialized multivitamin. Patient characteristics and total weight were comparable. Higher serum concentrations of ferritin ( 124.7 ± 96.2 µg/L versus 106.0 ± 83.0 µg/L , P = .016) , vitamin B12 ( 347.3 ± 145.1 pmol/L versus 276.8 ± 131.4 pmol/L , P < .001) , folic acid ( 34.9 ± 9.6 nmol/L versus 25.4 ± 10.7 nmol/L , P < .001) , and vitamin D ( 98.4 ± 28.7 nmol/L versus 90.0 ± 34.5 nmol/L , P = .002) were observed in users compared with nonusers after 1 year. Less new deficiencies were found for ferritin ( 1 % versus 4 % , P = .029) , vitamin B12 ( 9 % versus 23 % , P < .001) , and vitamin D ( 0 % versus 4 % , P < .001) in users compared with nonusers. Two and 3 years after the surgery these findings remained almost identical. The use of specialized multivitamin supplements resulted in less deficiencies of vitamin B12 , vitamin D , folic acid , and ferritin. The study showed that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients benefited from the specialized multivitamin supplements and it should be advised to this patient group.
