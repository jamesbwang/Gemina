  The rate of false allegations has been a topic of research spanning back to as early as the 1970s. Studies have often relied on data gathered by Child Protective Services workers and court administrators. Some researchers have also used hypothetical scenarios to estimate rates. However , given the plethora of sampling methods , there is a large variation in estimated rates of false allegations of sexual abuse depending on the data source and context of the allegation. Additionally , methodological problems such as unclear or invalid criteria used to judge truth or falsity of an allegation , unrepresentative samples , and ignoring important contextual variables such as the stage at which an allegation is made , currently all render the determination of actual rates of false child sexual abuse allegations to be unknown. This examination of literature is intended to gain a firmer understanding of the frequency at which allegations are false and during which stage of prosecution they occur , thus assisting with the legal practice of distinguishing between a false versus positive allegation. Research reviewed supports two general conclusions: ( a) the vast majority of allegations are true but ( b) false allegations do occur at some non-negligible rate. Suggestions for future research , as well as cautions about claims about specific rates of false allegations in the courtroom , are provided.
