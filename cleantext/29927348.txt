  After endocytosis , transmembrane cargos such as signaling receptors , channels and transporters enter endosomes where they are sorted to different destinations. Retromer and ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport) are functionally distinct protein complexes on endosomes that direct cargo sorting into the recycling retrograde transport pathway and the degradative multivesicular endosome pathway ( MVE) , respectively. Cargos destined for degradation in lysosomes are decorated with K63-linked ubiquitin chains , which serve as an efficient sorting signal for entry into the MVE pathway. Defects in K63-linked ubiquitination disrupt MVE sorting and degradation of membrane proteins. Here , we unexpectedly found that UBC-13 , the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that generates K63-linked ubiquitin chains , is essential for retrograde transport of multiple retromer-dependent cargos including MIG-14/ Wntless. Loss of ubc-13 disrupts MIG-14/ Wntless trafficking from endosomes to the Golgi , causing mis-sorting of MIG-14 to lysosomes and impairment of Wnt-dependent processes. We observed that retromer-associated SNX-1 and the ESCRT-0 subunit HGRS-1/ Hrs localized to distinct regions on a common endosome in wild type but overlapped on ubc-13 ( lf) endosomes , indicating that UBC-13 is important for the separation of retromer- and ESCRT-microdomains on endosomes. Our data suggest that cargo ubiquitination mediated by UBC-13 plays an important role in maintaining the functionally distinct subdomains to ensure efficient cargo segregation on endosomes.
