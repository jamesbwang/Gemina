  The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of miR-155 in colonic cancer tissue and to assess the potential predictive value of miR-155 in colonic cancer patients. From March to September of 2011 , we included 57 patients with primary colonic cancer who underwent curative surgical resection. Total RNAs were extracted from colonic cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Then the expression of miR-155 in colonic cancer and paracancerous tissues was investigated using real time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. And the relationship between miR-155 expression level and the clinical , pathological parameters of colonic cancer was analyzed. The relative expression level of miR-155 in colonic cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in paracancerous tissues and related to tumor-node-metastasis staging , tumor invasion , metastasis , and differentiation. The expression of miR-155 is up-regulated in colonic cancer tissues. MiR-155 may acts as proto-oncogenes involved in carcinogenesis , development , and invasion of colon cancer making it a potential target for gene therapy of colon cancer.
