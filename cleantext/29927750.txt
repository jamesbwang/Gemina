  To evaluate the short-term physiologic effects of respiratory muscle training with normocapnic hyperpnea ( NH) added to standard exercise training on respiratory muscle endurance/strength and exercise tolerance in COPD patients. Randomized controlled trial. Patients referred for rehabilitation were randomly assigned to 20 sessions ( twice daily 5 days/week) of either NH ( Group 1 , n = 12) or sham maneuvers ( Group 2 , n = 10) in addition to individualized cycle training and abdominal , upper and lower limb<symptom> muscle exercise. At baseline and end of study , patients underwent evaluation of respiratory muscle endurance , maximum voluntary ventilation ( MVV) , maximal inspiratory ( MIP) and expiratory pressures ( MEP) , and 6-min walking distance ( 6MWD). Following training , a significant improvement was found only for Group 1 in respiratory muscle endurance time ( by 654 ( 481) vs. 149 ( 216) sec for Group 2 , P = 0.0108) and MIP ( Group 1: from 81.2 ( 21.9) to 107.6 ( 23.0) cmH2O , P = 0.018 vs. Group 2: from 75.4 ( 13.8) to 81.3 ( 18.9) cmH2O , P = 0.139). The difference between groups for 6MWD , MVV and MEP was not significant. Short-term NH training added to standard exercise , compared to exercise training alone , improves respiratory muscle endurance and strength but not exercise tolerance in COPD patients.
