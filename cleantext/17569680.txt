  The influence of pulmonary vein ( PV) anatomy on cryo kinetics during cryoballoon ( CB) ablation is unclear. To investigate the relationship between PV anatomy and cryo kinetics during CB ablation for atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). Sixty consecutive patients were enrolled. PV anatomy , including ostial diameters ( long , short and corrected) , ratio between short and long diameters , ostium shape ( round , oval , triangular , and narrow) , and drainage pattern ( typical , with common trunk , common antrum , ostial branch and supernumerary PV) were evaluated on multi-detector computed tomography ( MDCT) images pre-procedure. Cryo kinetics parameters ( balloon freeze time from 0 to -30 ºC ( BFT) , balloon nadir temperature ( BNT) and balloon warming time from -30 to +15 ºC ( BWT)) were recorded during procedure. All p values are two-sided , with values of p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. 606 times of freezing cycle were accomplished. Moderate negative correlation was documented between BNT and corrected PV diameter ( r = -0.51 , p < 0.001) when using 23-mm CBs , and mild negative correlation ( r =- 0.32 , p = 0.001) was found when using 28-mm CBs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that PV corrected ostial diameter ( OR , 1.4; p = 0.004) predicted a BNT < -51 ºC when using 23-mm CBs , while PV ostium oval shape ( OR , 0.3; p = 0.033) and PV locations ( left inferior PV: OR , 0.04; p = 0.005; right superior PV: OR , 4.3; p = 0.025) predicted BNT < -51 ºC when using 28-mm CBs. MDCT can provide PV anatomy accurate evaluation prior CB ablation. PV anatomy is associated with cryo kinetics during ablation.
