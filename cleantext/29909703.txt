  To compare slit lamp mounted anterior segment cameras ( SLCs) versus digital compact camera ( DCC) with slit-lamp adaptor when used by an inexperienced technician. In this cross sectional study , where posterior capsule opacification ( PCO) was used as a comparator , patients were consented for one photograph with SLC and two with DCC ( DCC1 and DCC2) , with a slit lamp adaptor. An inexperienced clinic technician , who took all the photographs and masked the images , recruited one eye of each patient. Images were graded for PCO using EPCO 2000 software by two independent masked graders. Repeatability between DCC1 and DCC2 , and limits-of-agreement between SLC and DCC1 mounted on slit-lamp with an adaptor were assessed. Coefficient-of-repeatability and Bland-Altmann plots were analyzed. Seventy-two patients ( eyes) were recruited in the study. First 9 patients ( eyes) were excluded due to unsatisfactory image quality from both the systems. Mean evaluation of posterior capsule opacification ( EPCO) score for SLC was 2.28 ( 95 % CI: 2.09-2.45) , for DCC1 was 2.28 ( 95 % CI: 2.11-2.45) , and for the DCC2 was 2.11 ( 95 % CI: 2.11-2.45). There was no significant difference in EPCO scores between SLC vs. DCC1 ( p = 0.98) and between DCC1 and DCC2 ( p = 0.97). Coefficient of repeatability between DCC images was 0.42 , and the coefficient of repeatability between DCC and SLC was 0.58. DCC on slit lamp with an adaptor is comparable to a SLC. There is an initial learning curve , which is similar for both for an inexperienced person. This opens up the possibility for low cost anterior segment imaging in the clinical , research , and teaching settings.
