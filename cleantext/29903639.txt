  To describe a focused transthoracic echocardiography ( FoTE) curriculum for advanced practice providers ( APPs) for echocardiography-driven diagnosis of shock<symptom> in critically ill patients. Twelve APPs in 4 intensive care units at an academic medical center received didactic sessions on FoTE , including 1-on-1 proctorship with a registered cardiac sonographer. For a period of 6 months the trainees performed individual studies , then they performed FoTE examinations on critically ill patients; their diagnoses were compared with those of experienced intensivists for the same patients. After 6 months of multiple steps of training , APPs could acquire good echocardiographic views , achieving a good inter-rater agreement ( Cohen 's Îº of 0.745 ( 95 % CI , 0.385-1.0; P < .01)) in the diagnosis of shock<symptom> when compared to experienced intensivists. Structured FoTE curriculum enables APPs to have reasonably good diagnostic concordance with intensivists in an echocardiography-driven diagnosis of shock<symptom> in critically ill patients.
