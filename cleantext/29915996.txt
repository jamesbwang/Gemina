  Livestock and fish farming are rapidly growing industries facing the simultaneous pressure of increasing production demands and limited protein required to produce feed. Bacteria that can convert low-value non-food waste streams into singe cell protein ( SCP) present an intriguing route for rapid protein production. The oleaginous bacterium<pathogen> Rhodococcus<pathogen> opacus serves as a model organism for understanding microbial lipid production. SCP production has not been explored using an organism from this genus. In the present research , R. opacus strains DSM 1069 and PD630 were fed three agro-waste streams: ( 1) orange pulp , juice , and peel; ( 2) lemon pulp , juice , and peel; and ( 3) corn stover effluent , to determine if these low-cost substrates would be suitable for producing a value-added product , SCP for aquafarming or livestock feed. Both strains used agro-waste carbon sources as a growth substrate to produce protein-rich cell biomass suggesting that that R. opacus can be used to produce SCP using agro-wastes as low-cost substrates.
