  Management advice for women with lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS) is hampered by the lack of accurate personalised risk estimates for subsequent invasive breast cancer ( BC). Prospective validation of the only tool that estimates individual BC risk for a woman with LCIS , the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study Risk Evaluation Tool ( IBIS-RET) , is lacking. Using population-based cancer registry data for 732 women with LCIS , the calibration and discrimination accuracy of IBIS-RET Version 7.2 were assessed. The mean observed 10-year risk of invasive BC was 14.1 % ( 95 % CI: 11.3 % -17.5 %). IBIS-RET overestimated invasive BC risk ( p = 0.0003) and demonstrated poor discriminatory accuracy ( AUC 0.54 , 95 % CI: 0.48- 0.62). Clinicians should understand that IBIS-RET Version 7.2 may overestimate 10-year invasive BC risk for Australian women with LCIS. The newer IBIS-RET Version 8.0 , released September 2017 , includes mammographic density and may perform better , but validation is needed.
