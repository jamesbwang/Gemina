  Behavioral studies investigating facial expression recognition during development have applied various methods to establish by which age emotional expressions can be recognized. Most commonly , these methods employ static images of expressions at their highest intensity ( apex) or morphed expressions of different intensities , but they have not previously been compared. Our aim was to ( a) quantify the intensity and signal use for recognition of six emotional expressions from early childhood to adulthood and ( b) compare both measures and assess their functional relationship to better understand the use of different measures across development. Using a psychophysical approach , we isolated the quantity of signal necessary to recognize an emotional expression at full intensity and the quantity of expression intensity ( using neutral expression image morphs of varying intensities) necessary for each observer to recognize the six basic emotions while maintaining performance at 75 %. Both measures revealed that fear and happiness were the most difficult and easiest expressions to recognize across age groups , respectively , a pattern already stable during early childhood. The quantity of signal and intensity needed to recognize sad , angry , disgust , and surprise expressions decreased with age. Using a Bayesian update procedure , we then reconstructed the response profiles for both measures. This analysis revealed that intensity and signal processing are similar only during adulthood and , therefore , can not be straightforwardly compared during development. Altogether , our findings offer novel methodological and theoretical insights and tools for the investigation of the developing affective system.
