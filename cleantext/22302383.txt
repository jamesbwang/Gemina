  Fluorescent proteins often result in phototoxicity and cytotoxicity , in particular because some red fluorescent proteins produce and release reactive oxygen species ( ROS). The photogeneration of ROS is considered as a detrimental side effect in cellular imaging or is proactively utilized for ablating cancerous tissue. As ancient textiles or biomaterials , silk produced by silkworms can directly be used as fabrics or be processed into materials and structures to host other functional nanomaterials. It is reported that transgenic fusion of far-red fluorescent protein ( mKate2) with silk provides a photosensitizer hybridization platform for photoinducible control of ROS. Taking advantage of green ( visible) light activation , native and regenerated mKate2 silk can produce and release superoxide and singlet oxygen , in a comparable manner of visible light-driven plasmonic photocatalysis. Thus , the genetic expression of mKate2 in silk offers immediately exploitable and scalable photocatalyst-like biomaterials. It is further envisioned that mKate2 silk can potentially rule out hazardous concerns associated with foreign semiconductor photocatalytic nanomaterials.
