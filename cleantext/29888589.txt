  Microlens arrays can improve light transmittance in optical devices or enhance the photoelectrical conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Their surface morphology ( aspect ratio and packed density) is vital to photon management in solar cells. Here , we report a 100 % packed density paraboloidal microlens array ( PMLA) , with a large aspect ratio , fabricated by direct-write UV laser photolithography coupled with soft imprint lithography. Optical characterization shows that the PMLA structure can remarkably decrease the front-side reflectance of solar cell device. The measured electrical parameters of the solar cell device clearly and consistently demonstrate that the PMLA film can considerably improve the photoelectrical conversion efficiency. In addition , the PMLA film has superhydrophobic properties , verified by measurement of a large water contact angle , and can enhance the self-cleaning capability of solar cell devices.
