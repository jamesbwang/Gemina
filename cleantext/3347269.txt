  Rabies<pathogen> is a severe epidemic in Guangxi province , China , with hundreds of deaths occurring each year. In the past six decades , rabies<pathogen> has emerged three times in Guangxi , and the province has reported the largest number of rabies<pathogen> cases in China. The domestic dog is the principal vector for rabies<pathogen> , and 95 % of human cases are associated with transmission from dogs. To understand the genetic relationship between street rabies<pathogen> virus ( RABV) from Guangxi , genetic diversity analysis was performed using RABV isolates collected between 1999 and 2012. The N gene of 42 RABV isolates , and the P and M genes , as well as fragments of the 3 ' terminus ( L RABV is prevalent in Guangxi province and strains collected over the last two decades belong mainly to three groups ( I , II , III). These RABV isolates reveal genetic diversity. Individual RABV genes from Guangxi exhibit different evolutionary characteristics. The results will have benefits for continuing comprehensive rabies<pathogen> surveillance , prevention and control in China.
