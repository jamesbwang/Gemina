  Ovarian Sertoli cell tumors ( SCTs) are rare sex cord tumors ( Oliva et al. , 2005). The standard treatment for high-grade SCTs is surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Although platinum-based chemotherapy is also an option for recurrent SCTs ( Sigismondi et al. , 2012) , there is no established chemotherapy regimen for platinum-resistant recurrent SCTs. The effectiveness of pazopanib in treating epithelial ovarian cancer has recently been reported ( du Bois et al. , 2014; Pignata et al. , 2015). In the case described herein , pazopanib was used to treat the platinum-resistant recurrence of a high-grade Sertoli cell tumor , and the response was evaluated by 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET)- computed tomography ( CT). Written informed consent to reporting the case was obtained from the patient.
