  Guidelines on proton craniospinal irradiation ( p-CSI) target volume selection in children are lacking. We examined the impact of target volume selection on growth of children receiving p-CSI at a institution. Records of 58 patients who received p-CSI were reviewed. Median age at treatment initiation was 8 years ( range , 2 to 18 y). Spinal target volumes included whole vertebral body ( WVB) in 67 % and partial vertebral body ( PVB) in 33 %. Height z-scores before and after p-CSI were assessed using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stature-for-age charts. Maximal Cobb angle and height z-score change were compared for WVB versus PVB p-CSI using a t test. Among 93 % of patients with detailed data , median follow-up was 19 months ( range , 2 to 58 mo) after radiation therapy initiation. Quantitative growth evaluations were available for 64 % of patients. Median change in height z-score was -0.5 ( range , -2.1 to +0.7) after treatment , representing a decrease ( P < 0.001) in age-adjusted height. WVB patients had significantly greater reduction in height z-score versus PVB patients ( P = 0.004) but no difference in Cobb angle change ( P > 0.05). Despite reluctance surrounding its use in younger patients , PVB p-CSI was associated with similar spinal curvature and less growth suppression as compared with WVB p-CSI; a trial comparing WVB versus PVB in children may be warranted.
