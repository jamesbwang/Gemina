  Autophagy plays a critical role in tumorigenesis , but how autophagy contributes to cancer cells ' responses to chemotherapeutics remains controversial. To investigate the roles of autophagy in malignant gliomas , we used CRISPR/CAS9 to knock out the ATG5 gene , which is essential for autophagosome formation , in tumor cells derived from patients with glioblastoma. While ATG5 disruption inhibited autophagy , it did not change the phenotypes of glioma cells and did not alter their sensitivity to temozolomide , an agent used for glioblastoma patient therapy. Screening of an anticancer drug library identified compounds that showed greater efficacy to ATG5-knockout glioma cells compared to control. While several selected compounds , including nigericin and salinomycin , remarkably induced autophagy , potent autophagy inducers by mTOR inhibition did not exhibit the ATG5-dependent cytoprotective effects. Nigericin in combination with ATG5 deficiency synergistically suppressed spheroid formation by glioma cells in a manner mitigated by Ca
