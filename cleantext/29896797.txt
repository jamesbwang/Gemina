  Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9) and survivin are involved in several steps of carcinogenesis in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL). Yet , no MMP-9 and survivin-modulating drugs with low toxicity on normal cells but high efficacy against high MMP-9- and survivin-expressing leukaemia cells have been approved for clinical application in ALL. Prodigiosin , a secondary metabolite of Serratia<pathogen> marcescens<pathogen> , induces apoptosis in different kinds of cancer cells with low toxicity on normal cells. However , little is known about the effects of this compound on the high MMP-9- and survivin-expressing leukaemia cells. CCRF-CEM cells as a model for high MMP-9- and survivin-expressing ALL cells were treated with 100 , 200 and 400 nmol l The inhibitory effects of prodigiosin on MMP-9 and survivin expression , as well as its pro-apoptotic capacity , represent a novel therapeutic avenue against ALL cells. These findings provide an important and interesting basis to develop a new therapeutic compound with high potential against ALL cells.
