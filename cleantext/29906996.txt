  We revisit a classical problem of theoretical electrochemistry: the response of an electric double-layer capacitor ( EDLC) subject to a small , suddenly applied external potential. We solve the Debye-Falkenhagen equation to obtain exact expressions for key EDLC quantities: the ionic charge density , the ionic current density , and the electric field. In contrast to earlier works , our results are not restricted to the long-time asymptotics of those quantities. The solutions take the form of infinite sums whose successive terms all decay exponentially with increasingly short relaxation times. Importantly , this set of relaxation times is the same among all aforementioned EDLC quantities; this property is demanded on physical grounds but not generally achieved within approximation schemes. The scaling of the largest relaxation timescale τ _ ( 1) , that determines the long-time decay , is in accordance with earlier results: Depending on the Debye length , λ _ ( D) , and the electrode separation , 2L , it amounts to τ _ ( 1) ≃ λ _ ( D) L/D for L ≫ λ _ ( D) and τ _ ( 1) ≃ 4L ^ ( 2)/ ( π ^ ( 2) D for L ≪ λ _ ( D) , respectively ( with D being the ionic diffusivity).
