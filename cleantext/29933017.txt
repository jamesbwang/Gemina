  Incorrect paternity assignment in cattle can significantly influence the accuracy of genetic evaluation. Recent advances in high-throughput technology have facilitated the identification of single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) markers and their applications for filiation and individual identification. We genotyped 1074 bulls from a reference population of Chinese Simmental cattle for genomic selection using a BovineSNP770K BeadChip. Among them , a total of 136 bulls were randomly selected to design a suitable low-density SNP panel for paternity testing in Simmental cattle. Our results showed that 50 SNPs were determined to be the most informative markers in parental testing , with an accuracy of 99.89 % for CPE ( cumulative probability of exclusion) in the unknown female parent case. The 50 highly informative SNP markers were distributed across 25 chromosomes , and the mean intermarker distance per chromosome was 26.72 Mb. The average minor allele frequency ( MAF) , expected heterozygosity ( HE) , and polymorphic information content ( PIC) values were 0.3748 , 0.4998 , and 0.4818 , respectively. Finally , the 50 identified SNPs were used to estimate paternity for the remaining 938 of 1074 bulls from 23 farms. Our results revealed that 76.75 % of the 938 bulls were assigned parentage to the pedigree sires with 95 % confidence , and the rate of pedigree record mistakes ranged from 9.52 % -39.29 % in different herds. Our study is the first attempt to provide valuable insights into the extraction of informative markers through the application of high-density SNP chips for paternity testing in Chinese Simmental cattle.
