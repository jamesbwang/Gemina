  To evaluate whether there was an association between the systematic promotion of twin vaginal delivery and an increase in the rates of twin vaginal birth. We conducted a retrospective cohort study. We implemented a quality improvement initiative promoting twin vaginal delivery at an academic tertiary care center in 2013. The program included a needs assessment , simulation of vaginal twin delivery , online educational material , and the expansion of a dedicated twin clinic. We analyzed rates of twin vaginal birth in pregnancies at or beyond 24 weeks of gestation without a contraindication to labor , prior uterine surgery , or a demise or lethal anomaly of either twin. Using linear regression , we calculated annual adjusted rates of twin vaginal birth from 2010 to 2015 and in the 3 years before and after our intervention. We performed an interrupted time-series analysis estimating rates of change before and after the intervention to account for the influence of secular trend. Of 1,574 patients delivering twins , 897 ( 57 %) were included , with 479 in the 3 years before and 418 in the 3 years after the intervention. Adjusted rates of vaginal delivery increased from 32.1 % ( n = 153) to 44.2 % ( n = 185) before and after the intervention ( P < .01) , with a decrease in elective cesarean delivery from 54.6 % ( n = 479) to 44.3 % ( n = 185) ( P < .01). Rates of breech extraction increased after the intervention ( 5.7 % vs 9.3 % , P = .04). However , there was no difference in the rate of change in twin vaginal birth in the time period before ( 1.35 % annual increase , P = .76) or after ( 5.8 % annual increase , P = .40) the intervention. Although we observed an increased rate of twin vaginal birth in the time period after our intervention , because the rates of increase before and after the intervention were not statistically different , the increase is not attributable to our intervention and is more properly attributed to secular trend.
