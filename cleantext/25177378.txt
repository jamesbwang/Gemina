  With increasing the usage of myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI) for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease , we aimed to evaluate the side effects of low-dose radiation induced by this technique on blood elements , especially proteins and liver function factors. 40 eligible patients ( Mean age: 54.62 Â± 10.35 , 22 female and 18 male) , who had referred to the nuclear medicine department for MPI from May till August 2014 , were enrolled in the study. A blood sample was taken from each patient just before and 24 hours after the injection of 740Mbq of Tecnetium-99m Methoxy isobutyl isonitrile ( 99mTc-MIBI) in the rest phase of the MPI in a reference medical laboratory; blood tests included total protein ( TP) , albumin ( Alb) , globulin ( Glo) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) , alanine transaminase ( ALT) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) , direct bilirubin ( D.Bili) , total bilirubin ( T.Bili) , serum iron ( SI) , total iron bounding capacity ( TIBC) , Albumin globulin ratioA/G ratio) , and complete blood count ( CBC). Injection of 740Mbq99mTc-MIBI caused a significant increase in serum levels of AST ( p = 0.001) , ALT ( p = 0.001) , SI ( p = 0.030) , TIBC ( p = 0.003) and A/G Ratio ( p = 0.020). However , following radiotracer injection , a significant decrease was noted in the serum levels of TP ( p = 0.002) , Alb ( p = 0.014) , Glo ( p = 0.002) , ALP ( p = 0.001) , D.Bili ( p = 0.003) and T.Bili ( p = 0.000). Due to increased usage of MPI , our data highlights the importance of monitoring the clinical and paraclinical effects of the procedure on vital organs and physiological pathways to reduce their adverse effects.
