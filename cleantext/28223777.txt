  Phloretin , a glucose transporter ( GLUT) inhibitor , has pleiotropic effects. The present study examined the effects of phloretin on the commitment of marrow stromal cells to adipocytes , using the mouse marrow stromal cell line ST2. Oil red O staining showed that treatment with phloretin 10 ⁻ 100 µM promoted lipid accumulation. Real-time PCR showed that phloretin significantly increased the expression of adipogenic markers , including PPARγ , C/EBPα , fatty acid synthase , fatty acid-binding protein 4 , and adiponectin. Western blotting showed that phloretin inhibited ERK1/2 and JNK but activated p38 MAPK. Treatment with a MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor and a JNK inhibitor enhanced adipogenesis , similar to phloretin. In contrast , a p38 MAPK inhibitor suppressed phloretin-induced adipogenesis. Although phloretin phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) , co-incubation with an AMPK inhibitor did not block phloretin-induced adipogenesis. The 2-deoxyglucose colorimetric assay showed that phloretin and siRNA silencing of GLUT1 decreased glucose uptake. However , unlike phloretin treatment , GLUT1 silencing inhibited adipogenesis. In addition , phloretin enhanced adipogenesis in GLUT1 knocked-down cells. Taken together , phloretin induced adipogenesis of marrow stromal cells by inhibiting ERK1/2 and JNK and by activating p38 MAPK. The adipogenic effects of phloretin were independent of glucose uptake inhibition. Phloretin may affect energy metabolism by influencing adipogenesis and adiponectin expression.
