  The tumor starvation microenvironment plays a pivotal role in the malignant progression of cancer , which is closely related to autophagy , glycolysis , and epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT). Nevertheless , the underlying mechanisms of the starvation-mediated malignant phenotype are still not well documented. In this study , we aimed to investigate the effect of starvation on glycolysis , autophagy , and EMT in OSCC and to further elucidate the key metabolic modulator. The results showed that starvation can induce autophagy , EMT , and enhanced glycolysis in OSCC cells. We determined that the expression of the key glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-platelet ( PFKP) obviously increased under starvation conditions and that PFKP knockdown inhibited starvation-mediated glycolysis , autophagy and EMT in OSCC cells. Moreover , we confirmed that PFKP knockdown inhibited OSCC xenograft growth in vivo. In addition , PFKP expression was significantly increased in OSCC patients and its upregulation was associated with the presence of tumor pathological differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Taken together , our findings demonstrate that PFKP is necessary for starvation-mediated autophagy , glycolysis , and EMT , thereby promoting the malignant progression of OSCC.
