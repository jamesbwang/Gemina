  This paper mainly deals with the isovaleraldehyde degradation with the help of a nonthermal plasma surface discharge ( NPSD) coupled with photocatalysis. The efficiency of NPSD reactor , for gas treatment , was studied for different binary mixtures: ( 1) mixture of aldehydes ( Isovaleraldehyde and Butyraldehyde) and ( 2) mixture of aldehyde and amine ( Isovaleraldehyde and Trimethylamine). A planar continuous reactor is used to investigate the effect of addition of another pollutant on the performance of oxidation process. A synergetic effect was observed by combining NPSD and photocatalysis for the degradation of mixture of pollutants. In addition , combined NPSD/photocatalysis has significantly enhanced the CO
