  A new bulky silazido ligand ,- N ( SiHMe2) Dipp ( Dipp = C6H3-2,6-iPr2) , supports planar , three-coordinate homoleptic rare earth complexes Ln ( N ( SiHMe2) Dipp) 3 ( Ln = Sc , Y , and Lu) , each containing three secondary Ln â†¼ HSi interactions and one agostic CH bond. Y ( N ( SiHMe2) Dipp) 3 and acetophenone react via hydrosilylation , rather than by insertion into the Y-N bond or by enolate formation.
