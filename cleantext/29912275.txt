  We have previously demonstrated that blockade of T-type calcium channels by the non-selective antagonist , ethosuximide ( ETX) , is effective at reducing electrographical and behavioral correlates of alcohol-withdrawal ( WD) seizure<symptom>. Here , we investigated whether blockade of these calcium channels with the selective antagonist TTA-P2 also reduces alcohol-WD seizure<symptom>. The non-specific T-type calcium channel antagonist , ETX , is protective against alcohol-WD seizure<symptom>. However , the mechanism of this effect is unclear. Here , we provide evidence that further suggests selective blockade of T-type calcium channels are protective against alcohol-WD seizure<symptom> and WD-related mortality. We used an intermittent ethanol exposure model to produce WD-induced hyperexcitability in DBA/2 J mice. Seizure<symptom> severity was intensified with the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazole ( PTZ). TTA-P2 ( 10 mg/kg) reduced seizure<symptom> severity in mice undergoing alcohol WD with concurrent PTZ treatment ( 20 mg/kg). Moreover , TTA-P2 ( 20 and 40 mg/kg) was also protective against PTZ-induced ( 40 mg/kg) seizure<symptom> and mortality. These results are consistent with prior results using ETX , and suggest that the protective effects of ETX and TTA-P2 against EtOH WD seizures<symptom> are mediated by T-type calcium channels.
