  Pancreatic arteriovenous malformation ( pAVM) is a very rare entity , as less than 100 cases are reported in the international literature. Patients with pAVM may be asymptomatic or may present a wide range of symptoms , such as vague pain , feeling of fullness , gastrointestinal bleeding , or even portal hypertension. We present the multimodality approach in the diagnosis of a patient with pAVM and treatment via transcatheter arterial embolization of the lesion<symptom> using steel coils. The patient was free of symptoms 12 months later.
