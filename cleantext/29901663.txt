  After about three decades of development , the polyol process is now widely recognized and practised as a unique soft chemical method for the preparation of a large variety of nanoparticles which can be used in important technological fields. It offers many advantages: low cost , ease of use and , very importantly , already proven scalability for industrial applications. Among the different classes of inorganic nanoparticles which can be prepared in liquid polyols , metals were the first reported. This review aims to give a comprehensive account of the strategies used to prepare monometallic nanoparticles and multimetallic materials with tailored size and shape. As regards monometallic materials , while the preparation of noble as well as ferromagnetic metals is now clearly established , the scope of the polyol process has been extended to the preparation of more electropositive metals , such as post-transition metals and semi-metals. The potential of this method is also clearly displayed for the preparation of alloys , intermetallics and core-shell nanostructures with a very large diversity of compositions and architectures.
