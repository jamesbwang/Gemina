  Endothelin B ( ET ( B)) receptors present in abundance the central nervous system ( CNS) have been shown to have significant implications in its development and neurogenesis. We have targeted ET ( B) receptors stimulation using a highly specific agonist , IRL-1620 , to treat CNS disorders. In a rat model of cerebral ischemia intravenous administration IRL-1620 significantly reduced infarct volume and improved neurological and motor functions compared to control. This improvement , in part , is due to an increase in neuroregeneration. We also investigated the role of IRL-1620 in animal models of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). IRL-1620 improved learning and memory , reduced oxidative stress and increased VEGF and NGF in Abeta treated rats. IRL-1620 also improved learning and memory in an aged APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. These promising findings prompted us to initiate human studies. Successful chemistry , manufacturing and control along with mice , rat and dog toxicological studies led to completion of a human Phase I study in healthy volunteers. We found that a dose of 0.6 microg/kg of IRL-1620 can be safely administered , three times every four hours , without any adverse effect. A Phase II clinical study with IRL-1620 has been initiated in patients with cerebral ischemia and mild to moderate AD.
