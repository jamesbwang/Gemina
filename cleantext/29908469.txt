  A specific , sensitive and rapid ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric ( UHPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of six major bioactive constituents in Rhizoma Panacis Japonici ( RPJ) , including oleanolic acid-type chikusetsusaponin V , IV , hemsgiganoside B , damarane-type ginsenoside Rb1 , Rg1 and Re in rat plasma , using estazolam as the internal standard ( IS). Plasma samples were pretreated with methanol/acetonitrile ( 1:1 , V/V) for protein precipitation. Chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent Eclipse Plus C
