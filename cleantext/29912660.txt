  Assess the association between serum sex hormone level and prostate volume in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH). The study involved 239 BPH patients from January 2013 to June 2015 in our hospital. Each patient collected age , medical history , height , weight , body mass index , as well as a full examination of sex hormones , and transrectal ultrasound results. Estradiol ( E2) was significantly associated with prostate volume ( r = 0.151 , p = .02) and transitional zone volume ( r = 0.136 , p = .035). The association was more significant after adjusting age and BMI ( r = 0.253 and 0.250 , p < .001). Patients were divided into two groups according to prostate volume and E2 , respectively. E2 in patients with prostate volume ≤ 50 ml was significantly lower than those with prostate volume > 50 ml. Prostate volume , transitional zone volume and age were all significantly higher in the patients with E2 ≥ 160 umol/l than those in the patients with E2 < 160 umol/l. Through logistics regression , E2 ( p = .012 , OR = 1.004) are the only independent risk factor for prostate volume. E2 is significantly associated with prostate volume. High concentrations of E2 may be a risk factor for the large volume of prostate.
