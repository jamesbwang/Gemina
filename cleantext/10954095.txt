  Meniscal allograft transplantation yields good and excellent results but is limited by donor availability. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of radiated deep-frozen xenogenic meniscal tissue ( RDF-X) as an alternative graft choice in meniscal transplantation. The xenogenic meniscal tissues were harvested from the inner 1/3 part of the porcine meniscus and then irradiated and deeply frozen. The medial menisci of rabbits were replaced by the RDF-X. Meniscal allograft transplantation , meniscectomy and sham operation served as controls. Only a particular kind of rabbit-anti-pig antibody ( molecular ranging 60-80 kD) was detected in the blood serum at week 2. The menisci of the group RDF-X grossly resembled the native tissue and the allograft meniscus with fibrocartilage regeneration at postoperative 1 year. Cell incorporation and the extracellular matrix were mostly observed at the surface and the inner 1/3 part of the newly regenerated RDF-X , which was different from the allograft. The biomechanical properties of the group RDF-X were also approximate to those of the native meniscus except for the compressive creep. In addition , chondroprotection was achieved after the RDF-X transplantation although the joint degeneration was not completely prevented. To conclude , the RDF-X could be a promising alternative for meniscal transplantation with similar tissue regeneration capacity to allograft transplantation and superior chondroprotection. The potential minor immunological rejection should be further studied before its clinical application.
