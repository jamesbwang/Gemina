  We report a late clinical presentation of an aorto-right ventricular fistula<disease> ( RVF) extending from the right sinus of Valsalva into the RV outflow tract with significant left-to-right shunt and severe pulmonary hypertension. A three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram and a chest-computed tomography scans were performed to better characterize the abnormality. Aorto- RVF can be either congenital or acquired , secondary to endocarditis<disease> , Valsalva aneurysm<disease> rupture , chest trauma , or aortic dissection.
