  The discovery of biomarkers that confer high confidence of presymptomatic Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) diagnosis would be a valuable tool to study the etiology of the disease , to find risk factors , to discover more treatments and medicines. The present work reviews the potential biomarkers of AD based on the concentration changes of small molecules and chemical elements in noninvasive samples ( urine , saliva , hair and others). An updated table with 74 target compounds is produced and ranked. Until the present date , there are a few biomarkers , present in urine , with the most promising potential: isoprostane 8,12-iso-iPF2a-VI , total free amino acids , 8-hydroxy-2 '- deoxyguanosine , glycine and enzymatic activity of NaCl-stimulated PON1. All show increased levels in AD carriers , with the exception of NaCl-stimulated PON1.
