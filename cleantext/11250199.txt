  Complex<pathogen> tissue-specific and cell-specific signaling by the estrogen receptor ( ER) frequently leads to the development of resistance to endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Pure ER antagonists , which completely lack tissue-specific agonist activity , hold promise for preventing and treating endocrine resistance , however an absence of structural information hinders the development of novel candidates. Here we synthesize a small panel of benzopyrans with variable side chains to identify pure antiestrogens in a uterotrophic assay. We identify OP-1074 as a pure antiestrogen and a selective ER degrader ( PA-SERD) that is efficacious in shrinking tumors in a tamoxifen-resistant xenograft model. Biochemical and crystal structure analyses reveal a structure activity relationship implicating the importance of a stereospecific methyl on the pyrrolidine side chain of OP-1074 , particularly on helix 12.
