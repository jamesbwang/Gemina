  More than 1.5 million women per year have a benign breast biopsy resulting in concern about their future breast cancer ( BC) risk. This study examined the performance of 2 BC risk models that integrate clinical and histologic findings in this population. The BC risk at 5 and 10 years was estimated with the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium ( BCSC) and Benign Breast Disease to Breast Cancer ( BBD-BC) models for women diagnosed with benign breast disease ( BBD) at the Mayo Clinic from 1997 to 2001. Women with BBD were eligible for the BBD-BC model , but the BCSC model also required a screening mammogram. Calibration and discrimination were assessed. Fifty-six cases of BC were diagnosed among the 2142 women with BBD ( median age , 50 years) within 5 years ( 118 were diagnosed within 10 years). The BBD-BC model had slightly better calibration at 5 years ( 0.89; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.71-1.21) versus 10 years ( 0.81; 95 % CI , 0.70-1.00) but similar discrimination in the 2 time periods: 0.68 ( 95 % CI , 0.60-0.75) and 0.66 ( 95 % CI , 0.60-0.71) , respectively. In contrast , among the 1089 women with screening mammograms ( 98 cases of BC within 10 years) , the BCSC model had better calibration ( 0.94; 95 % CI , 0.85-1.43) and discrimination ( 0.63; 95 % CI , 0.56-0.71) at 10 years versus 5 years ( calibration , 1.31; 95 % CI , 0.94-2.25; discrimination , 0.59; 95 % CI , 0.46-0.71) where discrimination was not different from chance. The BCSC and BBD-BC models were validated in the Mayo BBD cohort , although their performance differed by 5-year risk versus 10-year risk. Further enhancement of these models is needed to provide accurate BC risk estimates for women with BBD. Cancer 2018. Â© 2018 American Cancer Society.
