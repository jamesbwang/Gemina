  Previous gene expression analysis identified a network of coexpressed genes that is associated with β-amyloid neuropathology and cognitive decline in older adults. The current work targeted influential genes in this network with quantitative proteomics to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. Data came from 834 community-based older persons who were followed annually , died , and underwent brain autopsy. Uniform structured postmortem evaluations assessed the burden of β-amyloid and other common age-related neuropathologies. Selected reaction monitoring quantified cortical protein abundance of 12 genes prioritized from a molecular network of aging human brain that is implicated in Alzheimer 's dementia. Regression and linear mixed models examined the protein associations with β-amyloid load and other neuropathological indices as well as cognitive decline over multiple years preceding death. Average age at death was 88.6 years. Overall , 349 participants ( 41.9 %) had Alzheimer 's dementia at death. A higher level of PLXNB1 abundance was associated with more β-amyloid load ( p = 1.0 × 10 Using targeted proteomics , this work identified cortical proteins involved in Alzheimer 's dementia and begins to dissect two different molecular pathways: one affecting β-amyloid deposition and another affecting resilience without a known pathological footprint.
