  The adaptive cellular response to low oxygen tensions is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factors ( HIFs) , a family of heterodimeric transcription factors composed of HIF-α and HIF-β subunits. Prolonged HIF expression is a key contributor to cellular transformation , tumorigenesis and metastasis. As such , HIF degradation under hypoxic conditions is an essential homeostatic and tumour-suppressive mechanism. LIMD1 complexes with PHD2 and VHL in physiological oxygen levels ( normoxia) to facilitate proteasomal degradation of the HIF-α subunit. Here , we identify
