  Metastasectomy ( MSX) is considered a treatment option in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC) at diagnosis , but its role in the targeted therapy era is unclear. We sought to describe the utilization trends of MSX and survival outcomes in a large US cohort. Using the National Cancer Database , we identified patients undergoing MSX for mRCC at diagnosis between 2006 and 2013. Linear regression methods estimated utilization trends , and hierarchical models identified independent predictors of MSX after adjusting for hospital clustering. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate overall survival according to treatment after propensity-score matching. Of 6994 mRCC patients , 1976 underwent MSX ( 28.3 %). Those treated at academic facilities were more likely to undergo a MSX ( OR: 1.57 , 95 % CI 1.20-2.06 , p = 0.001). In contrast , older patients ( OR: 0.99 , 95 % CI: 0.98-1.00) , black race ( OR: 0.65 , 95 % CI: 0.51-0.82) , higher pT stage ( OR: 0.76 , 95 % CI: 0.65-0.89) , and who received targeted therapy ( OR: 0.72 , 95 % CI: 0.63-0.82 , all p â‰¤ 0.008) were less likely to undergo MSX. Overall , MSX patients had an improved survival compared to non-MSX patients ( HR: 0.83 , 95 % CI: 0.77-0.90 , p < 0.001) , as well as among patients treated with targeted therapy ( HR: 0.77 , 95 % CI: 0.77-0.96 , p = 0.008). Our findings indicate that MSX-treated patients may benefit from an improved overall survival compared to non-MSX treated patients. Good patient selection and a proper risk stratification strategy are still very important considerations.
