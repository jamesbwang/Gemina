  The modified forced swim test ( MFST) has excellent predictive validity for investigating the antipsychotic activity of drugs , with particular emphasis on their activity toward negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However , its face and construct validity are less understood. Therefore , in the present study , some biochemical changes within GABAergic and serotonergic neurotransmission that could be related to observed MK-801-induced disturbances and the activity of compounds active at those neurotransmitters were investigated. In biochemical experiments , mice were treated acutely or chronically with MK-801 ( 13 days , 0.4 mg/kg). Their brains were dissected and frontal cortices and hippocampi were taken for further analysis. The levels of neurotransmitters were investigated with HPLC , and the expression of surrogate markers of schizophrenia ( 5-HT
