  Spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> type 17 ( SCA17) is caused by the expansion of translated CAG repeat in the TATA box binding protein ( TBP) gene encoding a long polyglutamine ( polyQ) tract in the TBP protein , which leads to intracellular accumulation of aggregated TBP and cell death. The molecular chaperones act in preventing protein aggregation to ameliorate downstream harmful events. In this study , we used Tet-On cells with inducible SCA17 TBP/Q
