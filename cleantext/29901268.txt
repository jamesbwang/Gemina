  Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) patients carrying EGFR activating mutations treated with gefitinib , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , will develop drug resistance. Ubiquitylation is one of major posttranslational modifications of proteins affecting the stability or function of proteins. However , the role of protein ubiquitylation in gefitinib resistance is poorly understood. To systematically identify the global change in protein expression and ubiquitylation during gefitinib resistance , a quantitative global proteome and ubiquitylome study in a pair of gefitinib-resistant and sensitive NSCLC cells is carried out. Altogether , changes in expression of 3773 proteins are quantified , and changes in ubiquitylation of 2893 lysine sites in 1415 proteins are measured in both cells. Interestingly , lysosomal and endocytic pathways , which are involved in autophagy regulation , are enriched with upregulated proteins or ubiquitylated proteins in gefitinib-resistant cells. In addition , HMGA2 overexpression or ALOX5 knockdown suppresses gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells by inhibiting autophagy. Overall , these results reveal the previously unknown global ubiquitylome and proteomic features associated with gefitinib resistance , uncover the opposing roles of HMGA2 or ALOX5 in regulating gefitinib resistance and autophagy , and will help to identify new therapeutic targets in overcoming gefitinib resistance.
