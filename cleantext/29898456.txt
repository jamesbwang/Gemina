  Changes in the brain 's inflammatory status can lead to psychopathological responses , especially depression<symptom> Using animal models , recent studies have revealed that this pathology is due , in part , to innate immune responses of monocytes. We focus on the involvement of Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) and expression of genes encoding their negative regulators , SOCS1 , TOLLIP , SIGIRR , MyD88s , NOD2 , and TNFAIP3 , in CD14 + monocytes from 34 patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD) and 33 healthy controls before and after treatment with antidepressants. We also seek to investigate their association with depression<symptom> severity , measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression<symptom> Rating Scale ( HAMD-17). mRNA expression of all TLRs , except TLR3 and -5 , was significantly higher in monocytes from patients with MDD than in those from controls. Conversely , the `` brakes '' in TLR signaling , including TOLLIP , MyD88s , NOD2 , and TNFAIP3 , were downregulated. In clinical findings , the remission group showed higher baseline TLR4 and lower baseline IRAK3 mRNA levels but only baseline elevated SOCS1 mRNA levels , which were inversely correlated with HAMD-17 scores , predicting worsened outcome in MDD patients. In addition , TNFAIP3 mRNA levels were increased by antidepressant treatment. Collectively , our findings suggest a role for dysregulation of TLR signaling in monocytes in MDD and identify a balancing effect of antidepressants on this dysregulation.
