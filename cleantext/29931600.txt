  Actinobacteria , a large group of Gram-positive bacteria , secrete a wide range of extracellular enzymes involved in the degradation of organic compounds and biopolymers including the ubiquitous aminopolysaccharides chitin and chitosan. While chitinolytic enzymes are distributed in all kingdoms of life , actinobacteria are recognized as particularly good decomposers of chitinous material and several members of this taxon carry impressive sets of genes dedicated to chitin and chitosan degradation. Degradation of these polymers in actinobacteria is dependent on endo- and exo-acting hydrolases as well as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases. Actinobacterial chitinases and chitosanases belong to nine major families of glycosyl hydrolases that share no sequence similarity. In this paper , the distribution of chitinolytic actinobacteria within different ecosystems is examined and their chitinolytic machinery is described and compared to those of other chitinolytic organisms.
