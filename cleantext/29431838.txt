  A sometimes overlooked degree of freedom in the design of many spectroscopic ( mainly Raman) experiments involve the choice of experimental geometry and polarization arrangement used. Although these aspects usually play a rather minor role , their neglect may result in a misinterpretation of the experimental results. It is well known that polarization- and/or angular- resolved spectroscopic experiments allow one to classify the symmetry of the vibrations involved or the molecular orientation with respect to a smooth surface. However , very low detection limits in surface-enhancing spectroscopic techniques are often accompanied by a complete or partial<symptom> loss<symptom> of this detailed information. In this review , we will try to elucidate the extent to which this approach can be generalized for molecules adsorbed on plasmonic nanostructures. We will provide a detailed summary of the state-of-the-art experimental findings for a range of plasmonic platforms used in the last ~ 15 years. Possible implications on the design of plasmon-based molecular sensors for maximum signal enhancement will also be discussed.
