  Right ventricular function is a crucial factor of the prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE). To evaluate the right ventricular function in SLE patients with different degrees of pulmonary hypertension ( PH) by strain and strain rate imaging. A total of 102 SLE patients and 30 healthy volunteers were studied between October 2015 and May 2016. Patients were divided into three groups according to pulmonary artery systolic pressure ( PASP) estimated by echocardiography: group control ( A); PASP ≤ 30 mmHg ( group B , n = 37); PASP 30-50 mmHg ( mild PH; group C , n = 34); and PASP ≥ 50 mmHg ( moderate-to-severe PH; group D , n = 31). Longitudinal peak systolic strain ( ε) and strain rate ( SR) , including systolic strain rate ( SRs) , early diastolic strain rate ( SRe) and late diastolic strain rate ( SRa) were measured in the basal , middle and apical segments of the right ventricular free wall in participants by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography ( 2D-STE) from the apical four-chamber view. A p < 0.05 was set for statistical significance. The parameters of ε , SRs , SRe , and SRa were significantly decreased in groups C and D compared with groups A and B. The ε of each segments was significantly lower in group D than in group C , while there were no differences in SRs , SRe and SRa between groups C and D. Strain and strain rate imaging could early detect the right ventricular dysfunction in SLE patients with PH , and provide important value for clinical therapy and prognosis of these patients.
