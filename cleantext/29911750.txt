  Methotrexate ( MTX) is a key component of acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) therapy , but it is associated with serious toxicities in a considerable number of patients. The aim of the current study was to determine which variables were associated with MTX toxicity in children , adolescents and young adults with ALL. In this prospective study , 35 patients with newly diagnosed ALL , treated according to the 58951 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Children 's Leukemia Group ( EORTC-CLG) protocol , were prospectively enrolled. Toxicity data was collected objectively after each high-dose methotrexate ( HD-MTX) course. The risk factors of MTX toxicity were determined using multiple linear regression analysis , with age , gender , immunophenotype , risk group , plasma MTX levels , plasma homocysteine ( HCY) levels , and MTHFR C677T included as independent variables. Twenty-five ( 71.4 %) patients experienced toxicity on at least 1 course of HD-MTX. In the univariate linear regression , the global toxicity score was associated with a significant rise in plasma HCY concentrations within 48 h after MTX administration ( β = 0.4; R2 = 0.12; p = 0.02). In the multiple regression model , the global toxicity score was significantly associated with a higher MTX plasma levels at 48 h ( β = 0.5; R2 = 0.38; p = 0.001) and CT 677 MTHFR genotype ( β = 0.3; R2 = 0.38; p = 0.01). Routine monitoring of plasma MTX concentrations is essential to detect patients at a high risk of MTX toxicity. MTHFR C677T genotyping may be useful for predicting MTX toxicity.
