  To improve understanding of rising cesarean section ( CS) rates in the UK , this study assessed the relation between clinician thresholds for performing CS for delayed labor progress or suspected fetal distress and corresponding CS rates in Aberdeen , UK. Time-trends analysis of term births from 1988 to 2012 in a population of nulliparous women ( N = 53 745) in Aberdeen , UK , using Chi-square test for trend , and binary logistic regression. Data were obtained from the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank. Unplanned CS rates per quintile increased from 11.0 % ( 1391/12 686) to 21.1 % ( 2383/11 273) between 1988 and 2012 , while planned CS rates increased from 2.7 % ( 338/12 686) to 5.2 % ( 591/11 273). The median duration of labor before CS for delayed progress per quintile decreased from 17.2 ( IQR 12.5-22.3) to 13.1 hours ( 9.6-16.9) before first stage CS and from 17.1 ( 12.6-22.3) to 15.3 ( 11.5-19.1) hours before second stage CS ( P < .001). The proportion of CS for suspected fetal distress performed with evidence of fetal acidosis declined from 23.4 % ( 98/418) to 17.4 % ( 106/608) per quintile ( P < .01). Neonatal unit admission ( adjusted OR 1.99 , 95 % CI 1.85-2.14) was more likely following unplanned CS than vaginal births. Birth trauma was less likely following both unplanned ( adjusted OR 0.48 , 95 % CI 0.39-0.60) and planned ( adjusted OR 0.33 , 95 % CI 0.18-0.63) CS. Increased CS rates can be partly attributed to lowered clinical thresholds for intrapartum CS. Higher CS rates are associated with less birth trauma for the offspring.
