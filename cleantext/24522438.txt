  Red cell distribution width ( RDW) , a routine component of the complete blood count ( CBC) , measures variation in the size of circulating erythrocytes. It has been associated with several clinical outcomes in cardiovascular disease. We sought to strengthen the association between RDW and mortality in patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) by pooling together data from available studies. Studies that fulfilled the following were identified for analysis: 1) observational; 2) included patients admitted for ACS; 3) reported data on all-cause or cardiovascular ( CV) mortality in association with a low or high RDW; and 4) used logistic regression analysis to control for confounders. Using MEDLINE , Clinical Key , ScienceDirect , Scopus , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases , a search for eligible studies was conducted until January 9 , 2017. The quality of each study was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Our primary outcome of interest was all-cause or CV mortality. We also investigated the impact of RDW on major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACEs) for the studies that reported these outcomes. Review Manager ( RevMan) 5.3 was utilized to perform Mantel-Haenzel analysis of random effects and compute for relative risk. We identified 13 trials involving 10,410 patients , showing that in ACS , a low RDW is associated with a statistically significant lower all-cause or CV mortality ( RR 0.35 , ( 95 % CI 0.30 to 0.40) , P < 0.00001 , I A low RDW is also associated with lower risk for MACEs after an ACS ( RR 0.56 , ( 95 % CI 0.51 to 0.61) , P < 0.00001 , I
