  Over the past few decades , important knowledge on why inhibitors develop and better information about significant risk factors have become available. A series of both genetic and nongenetic factors are recognized and clinical score systems were proposed to quantify the risk for each patient. In addition , modulation of the immunological response was acknowledged to play a pivotal role in the occurrence of inhibitors. However , with the exception of mutation testing in severe hemophilia B patients , no single risk factor or clinical score is currently utilized in clinical practice. `` Omics '' technologies are large-scale hypothesis-generating approaches , which provide the tools to study issues contributing to a complex and multifactorial phenomenon , such as inhibitor development. Newer cutting edge technologies may enable a more accurate estimation of the personal risk profile and provide a reliable tool to accurately measure the risk periodically , thereby enabling strategies to foresee and prevent inhibitor formation.
