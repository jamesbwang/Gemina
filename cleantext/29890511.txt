  Thallium ( Tl) , a rare metal , is universally present in the environment with high toxicity and accumulation. Thallium 's behavior and fate require further study , especially in the Pearl River Delta ( PRD) , where severe Tl pollution incidents have occurred. One hundred two pairs of soil and flowering cabbage samples and 91 pairs of soil and lettuce samples were collected from typical farmland protection areas and vegetable bases across the PRD , South China. The contamination levels and spatial distributions of soil and vegetable ( flowering cabbages and lettuces) Tl across the PRD were investigated. The relative contributions of soil properties to the bioavailability of Tl in vegetables were evaluated using random forest<disease>. Random forest<disease> is an accurate learning algorithm and is superior to conventional and correlation-based regression analyses. In addition , the health risks posed by Tl exposure via vegetable intake for residents of the PRD were assessed. The results indicated that rapidly available potassium ( K) and total K in soil were the most important factors affecting Tl bioavailability , and the competitive effect of rapidly available K on vegetable Tl uptake was confirmed in this field study. Soil weathering also contributed substantially to Tl accumulation in the vegetables. In contrast , organic matter might not be a major factor affecting the mobility of Tl in most of the lettuce soils. Fe and manganese ( Mn) oxides also contributed little to the bioavailability of Tl. A risk assessment suggested that the health risks for Tl exposure through flowering cabbage or lettuce intake were minimal.
