  The Rayleigh-Taylor ( RT) instability occurs at an interface between two fluids of differing density during an acceleration. These instabilities can occur in very diverse settings , from inertial confinement fusion ( ICF) implosions over spatial scales of ( Formula: see text) cm ( 10-1,000 Î¼m) to supernova explosions at spatial scales of ( Formula: see text) cm and larger. We describe experiments and techniques for reducing ( `` stabilizing '') RT growth in high-energy density ( HED) settings on the National Ignition Facility ( NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Three unique regimes of stabilization are described: (
