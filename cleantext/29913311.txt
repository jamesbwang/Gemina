  The phylogenetic relationships and classification of the freshwater fish order Cypriniformes , like many other species-rich groups of vertebrates , has evolved over time with some consistency and inconsistencies of relationships across various studies. Within Cypriniformes , the Holarctic family Leuciscidae is one of the most widely distributed and highly diverse monophyletic groups of cyprinoids. Despite several studies conducted on this group , alternative hypotheses exist as to the composition and relationships within Leuciscidae. Here we assess the extent , composition , phylogenetic relationships , and taxonomy of this highly diverse group of fishes , using multiple mitochondrial and nuclear loci and a comprehensive and dense taxonomic sampling. Analyses of 418 specimens ( 410 species) resolve a well-supported Leuciscidae including 362 specimens ( 358 taxa) in six well-supported subfamilies/major clades: Pseudaspininae/Far East Asian clade ( FEA); Laviniinae/North American Western clade ( WC); Plagopterinae/North American Creek Chub-Plagopterin clade ( CC-P); Leuciscinae/Eurasian Old World clade ( OW) ( minus Phoxinus) plus North American Notemigonus; Phoxininae/Eurasian Phoxinus clade ( PHX); and Pogonichthyinae/North American clade ( NA) including all remaining leuciscids. Within Leuciscidae , neither the traditional phoxinins ( Phoxinus , FEA , Nearctic genera) nor all Nearctic genera ( minus Notemigonus) are resolved as monophyletic; whereas the WC and CC-P form two independent lineages from remaining North American cyprinoids. A close relationship exists between Eurasian Phoxinus , NA , and OW clades , while FEA is the sister group to all remaining Leuciscidae. Major lineages resolved within these six subfamilies are mostly congruent with some previous studies. Our results suggests a complex evolutionary history of this diverse and widespread group of fishes.
