  Atypical ruminant pestiviruses are closely related to the two bovine viral diarrhoea<disease> virus ( BVDV) species , BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. While there is evidence of cross-protective immune responses between BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 , despite antigenic differences , there is little information on the antigenic cross-reactivity with atypical ruminant pestiviruses. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the specificity of antibody and T cell responses induced by experimental infection of calves with BVDV-1 strain Ho916 , Th/04 _ KhonKaen ( TKK) , an Asiatic atypical ruminant pestivirus , or co-infection with both viruses. Homologous virus neutralization was observed in sera from both single virus infected and co-infected groups , while cross-neutralization was only observed in the TKK infected group. T cell IFN-γ responses to both viruses were observed in the TKK infected animals , whereas Ho916 infected calves responded better to homologous virus. Specifically , IFN-γ responses to viral non-structural protein , NS3 , were observed in all infected groups while responses to viral glycoprotein , E2 , were virus-specific. Broader antigen-specific cytokine responses were observed with similar trends between inoculation groups and virus species. The limited T cell and antibody immune reactivity of Ho916 inoculated animals to TKK suggests that animals vaccinated with current BVDV-1-based vaccines may not be protected against atypical ruminant pestiviruses.
