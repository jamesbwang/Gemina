  An 87-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to fever<disease> and elevated liver enzymes. Computed tomography ( CT) scan revealed bile duct stones with a dilated biliary system , which confirmed the diagnosis of cholangitis. A 12-cm simple hepatic cyst<disease> was also seen in the right liver , which had been detected on CT scan 5 years before , and did not change in size. Fever<disease> did not subside even after endoscopic biliary drainage and a repeated CT scan showed an enlarged cyst<disease> up to 14 cm , suggesting cyst<disease> infection<disease>. An enlarged hepatic cyst<disease> collapsed after percutaneous transhepatic drainage , along with resolution of fever<disease> Simple hepatic cysts<disease> are common and most of them are asymptomatic. Infection of simple hepatic cysts<disease> is a rare condition and the major entry route is considered as the biliary tract as communication between the biliary tract and cysts<disease> is reportedly observed in those cases. However , in our case , no communication was seen on cholangiogram or cystogram on fluoroscopy and bilirubin level of the cyst<disease> aspirate was low. Given the fact that patients with cholangitis are rarely complicated by hepatic cyst<disease> infection<disease> , other routes of bacterial entry to simple hepatic cysts<disease> should also be considered.
