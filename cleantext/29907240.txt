  To clarify the effect of programmed exercise ( PE) , performed for at least six weeks , on perceived stress ( PS) in middle aged and old women. A structured search was carried out in PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library , Scielo , Web of Science and Scopus , from database inception through January 10 , 2018 , without language restriction. The US , UK , and Australian clinical trials databases were also searched. The search included a combination of the terms `` programmed exercise '' , `` perceived stress '' , `` menopausal women '' and `` randomized controlled trial '' ( RCTs). PE was classified according to duration as `` mid-term exercise intervention '' ( MTEI; mean duration 6 months) , and `` long-term exercise intervention '' ( LTEI; mean duration 12 months). Mean ± standard deviations of changes in PS scores , as assessed with different questionnaires , were calculated as standardized mean differences ( SMDs) and used as effect size for meta-analysis. SMDs of PS after intervention were pooled using a random-effects model. Study quality and bias risk were assessed with the Cochrane tool. Five RCTs that studied midlife and older women ( mean age 47.0 ± 1.7 years minimum to 71.8 ± 5.6 maximum) were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant effect of PE on PS score ( SMD: -0.16; 95 % CI: -0.43 to 0.11). In subgroup analyses , there was no significant effect of PE on PS with mid-term interventions ( SMD:- 0.17; 95 % CI: -0.59 to 0.25) nor with long-term interventions ( SMD: -0.02; 95 % CI: -0.42 to 0.38) as compared with controls. PE of low to moderate intensity does not improve PS in midlife and older women.
