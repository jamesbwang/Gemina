  Here , we provide a comprehensive study related to the risks of all biopharmaceutical firms going public in the USA between 1996 and 2015. We found 355 firms that met our requirements for being in the sector that focuses on creating drugs for humans. Collectively , these firms spent approximately US$ 86.9 billion on research and development ( R&D) during this time. They also lost approximately US$ 69.3 billion in combined net income. We also examine the delisting of these firms from a public market , their number of collaborators at the initial public offering ( IPO) , and estimate the percentage ownership by other biopharmaceutical firms at the IPO.
