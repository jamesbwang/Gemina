  The activation of disulfides by Cu ( II) salts has been realized , which triggers a highly efficient electrophilic sulfenoamination of alkenes under aerobic conditions. Various sulfenyl N-heterocycles and their Selena counterparts were produced regioselectively , with no competing disulfidation products detected. Mechanistic studies suggest a profound influence of the counterions on the Lewis acidic copper center , and the important roles of oxygen and DMSO as co-oxidants for these cyclization processes.
