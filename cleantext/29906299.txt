  Primary liver transplantation is recommended for central POSTTEXT III and POSTTEXT IV hepatoblastoma. Aim is to prospectively assess safety , oncological efficacy of aggressive non-transplant extended hepatic resections in those patients. A prospective study included 18 children with central PRETEXT III and IV , 3 had primary liver transplantation whereas 15 underwent hepatic resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Median tumor volume was 317 ml ( range 135-546). After 4 cycles chemotherapy , POST-TEXT was III in 12 and IV in 3 patients. There was no perioperative mortality. Postoperative complications were 2 bile leaks , one temporary decompensation and one sub-phrenic collection requiring drainage. 1 and 3 years disease free survival was 93.3 % and 73.3 % respectively. 3 years overall survival was 86.6 %. Four patients developed recurrence , of which two died. Early recurrence within one year occurred in one patient. All recurrences were distant metastases. Extended major hepatic resection for selected cases of POST-TEXT III and IV hepatoblastoma is technically challenging but feasible approach with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Oncological outcomes are comparable to liver transplantation without the long-term commitment of immunosuppression or donor risk and morbidity however; potential donor should always be prepared for plan B if needed.
