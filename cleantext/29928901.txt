  Damage and loss of retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs) can cause visual impairment. The underlying molecular mechanisms that mediate RGC death in ischemic retinal diseases are still unclear. In this study , we sought to understand the neuroprotective effect of rapamycin , the selective inhibitor of mTORC1 , on RGC survival and the cellular mechanics that mediate this effect. Recent studies have reported that the epidermal growth factor ( EGF) receptor shows an increase in expression in astrocytes after injury , and this receptor can promote their transformation into reactive astrocytes. Our results , along with previous works from others , show the colocalization of phosphor-EGF receptors with the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic proteins in reactive astrocytes in the injured retina. In our in vitro studies , using primary astrocyte cultures of the optic nerve head of rats , showed that rapamycin significantly blocked EGF-induced mTOR signaling mainly through the PI3K/Akt pathway in primary astrocytes , but not through the MAPK/Erk pathway. Additionally , rapamycin dramatically inhibited the activation of mTOR signaling in our ratinal ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R) injury model in vivo. Astrocyte activation was assessed by immunostaining retinal flat mounts or cross sections with antibody against GFAP , and we also used western blots to detect the expression of GFAP. Taken together , these results revealed that rapamycin decreases the activation of astrocytes after retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Furthermore , rapamycin can improve retinal RGC survival in rats during I/R , as detected by FluoroGold labeling. Our data reveals the neuroprotective effects of rapamycin in an experimental retina injury model , possibly through decreasing glial-dependent intracellular signaling mechanisms for suppressing apoptosis of RGCs. Our study also presents an approach to targeting reactive astrocytes for the treatment of optic neurodegenerations.
