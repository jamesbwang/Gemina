  Dialysis treatment is known to lead to reduced quality of life ( QOL) among patients. This decreased QOL is believed to influence medication compliance , although this effect has not yet been clarified. In this study , we investigated whether decreased QOL due to dialysis treatment does in fact influence medication compliance. Participants were 92 patients who self-managed their medication and were receiving dialysis treatment at Secomedic Hospital or Chiba Central Medical Center. We surveyed their age , sex , dialysis period , and medication management situation , and administered the EQ-5D and Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument-Short Form. A multiple logistic regression analysis with medication compliance as the dependent variable and QOL as the independent variable was conducted. The recovery rate and effective response rate were both 100 %. The results indicated that patients with good sleep QOL ( mean or above) had higher odds of medication compliance ( odds ratio , 3.36; 95 % confidence interval , 1.26-8.96;
