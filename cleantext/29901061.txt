  Employing molecular dynamic ( MD) simulations and solid-state density functional theory ( DFT) , we carried out thorough studies to understand the interaction-structure-property interrelationship of the co-crystal explosive 1: 1 CL-20: TNT. Our results revealed that the co-crystallization of CL-20 and TNT molecules enhances the intermolecular binding forces , where the main driving force for the formation of the co-crystal CL-20/ TNT comes from HO and CO interactions , while OO contributes to the co-crystal stabilization. Furthermore , we also used the concept of atoms in molecule ( AIM) and the reduced density gradient ( RDG) to describe the spatial arrangements and interactions of co-crystal compositions , which showed that although the adjoining TNT molecules possess two symmetry groups and the adjoining CL-20 molecules possess the same symmetry group , their interactions are not identical. These spatial arrangements provide a good reference to the formation of other co-crystals. When the obtained structural and detonation properties of the three crystals were compared , it was observed that the CL-20/ TNT co-crystal achieved the desirable properties of explosives , i.e. , low-sensitivity and high-energy , possessing the advantages of both CL-20 and TNT explosives.
