  The induced resistance against plant pathogens via biocontrol agents is considered as an eco-friendly and promising strategy. In this study , the induced resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae<pathogen> ( M. oryzae<pathogen>) in rice seedling by a new potential biocontrol agent Streptomyces JD211 ( JD211) was evaluated. The effects of JD211 on defense-related enzymes activities and defense genes expression were investigated. The biocontrol efficacy of different JD211 concentrations was different , and the treatment of 10 g kg
