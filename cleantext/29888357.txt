  Photocatalysis , the use of light to promote organic transformations , is a field of catalysis that has received limited attention despite existing for over 100 years. With the revolution of photoredox catalysis in 2008 , the rebirth or awakening of the field of photoorganocatalysis has brought new ideas and reactions to organic synthesis. This review will focus on the sudden outburst of literature regarding the use of small organic molecules as photocatalysts after 2013. In particular , it will focus on acridinium salts , benzophenones , pyrylium salts , thioxanthone derivatives , phenylglyoxylic acid , BODIPYs , flavin derivatives , and classes of organic molecules as catalysts for the photocatalytic generation of C-C and C-X bonds.
