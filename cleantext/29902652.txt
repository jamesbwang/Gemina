  One challenge in using microbial fuel cells ( MFCs) for wastewater treatment is the reduction in performance over time due to cathode fouling. An in-situ technique was developed to clean air cathodes using magnets on either side of the electrode , with the air-side magnet moved to clean the water-side magnet by scraping off the biofilm. The power output of the magnet-cleaned cathodes after one month of operation was 132 Â± 7 mW m
