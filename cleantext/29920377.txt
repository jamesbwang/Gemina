  The primate dorsal visual stream processes object shape to guide actions involving an object , but the transmission of shape information beyond posterior parietal cortex remains largely unknown. To clarify the information flow between parietal and frontal cortex , we applied electrical microstimulation during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI) in a shape-selective patch in the posterior part of the Anterior Intraparietal area ( pAIP) to chart its connectivity. Subsequently , we recorded single-unit responses to images of objects in the fMRI activation in prefrontal cortex , corresponding to area 45B , elicited by pAIP microstimulation. Neurons in area 45B had properties similar to neurons in pAIP , responding selectively to shape contours and to very small shape fragments measuring less than one deg at exceedingly short latencies. However , contrary to the prevailing view on the hierarchical organization of cortical areas , neurons in area 45B preferred even smaller shape fragments and had smaller receptive fields than neurons in pAIP. These findings provide the first evidence for ultra-fast shape processing in prefrontal cortex , and suggest that the pathway from pAIP to area 45B may not be important for object grasping.
