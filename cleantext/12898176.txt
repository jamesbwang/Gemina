  Numerous studies have analyzed associations between apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) and histopathological features such as Ki-67 proliferation index in breast cancer ( BC) , with mixed results. The purpose of this study was to perform a multicenter analysis to determine relationships between ADC and expression of Ki-67 and tumor grade in BC. For this study , data from six centers were acquired. The sample comprises 870 patients ( all female; mean age , 52.6 ± 10.8 years). In every case , breast magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging was performed. The comparison of ADC values in groups was performed by Mann-Whitney U test where the p values are adjusted for multiple testing ( Bonferroni correction). The association between ADC and Ki-67 values was calculated by Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient. Sensitivity , specificity , negative and positive predictive values , accuracy , and AUC were calculated for the diagnostic procedures. ADC thresholds were chosen to maximize the Youden index. Overall , data of 870 patients were acquired for this study. The mean ADC value of the tumors was 0.98 ± 0.22 × 10 ADC can not be used as a surrogate marker for proliferation activity and/or for tumor grade in breast cancer.
