  Tri-methylation on histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me3) is associated with active gene expression but its regulatory role in transcriptional activation is unclear. Here we used Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> to investigate the connection between H3K4me3 and gene expression regulation during aging. We uncovered around 30 % of H3K4me3 enriched regions to show significant and reproducible changes with age. We further showed that these age-dynamic H3K4me3 regions largely mark gene-bodies and are acquired during adult stages. We found that these adult-specific age-dynamic H3K4me3 regions are correlated with gene expression changes with age. In contrast , H3K4me3 marking established during developmental stages remained largely stable with age , even when the H3K4me3 associated genes exhibited RNA expression changes during aging. Importantly , the genes associated with changes in H3K4me3 and RNA levels with age are enriched for functional groups commonly implicated in aging biology. Therefore , our findings suggested divergent roles of H3K4me3 in gene expression regulation during aging , with important implications on aging-dependent pathophysiologies.
