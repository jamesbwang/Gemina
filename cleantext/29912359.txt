  To evaluate the prevalence of clinical mcr-1-positive Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> and characterize the antimicrobial resistance profiles of mcr-1-positive E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and mcr-1-negative E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in China. A total of 6264 clinical E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( n = 3854) and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( n = 2410) were collected from hospitalized patients from 18 to 20 hospitals as part of the China Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Trial ( CARST) between January 2007 and June 2016. PCR was used to screen for the mcr-1 gene among all isolates. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the broth microdilution method. mcr-1-positive pathogens were then characterized by MLST and minimum spanning tree analysis using the BURST algorithm for related STs. We examined 39 ( 0.62 %) clinical isolates of mcr-1-positive E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> over a 10 year period. Resistance to antimicrobial agents was significantly more severe in mcr-1-positive isolates than mcr-1-negative isolates , particularly piperacillin ( P = 0.008) , amikacin ( P < 0.0001) , nitrofurantoin ( P < 0.004) and fosfomycin ( P < 0.0001). Among mcr-1-carrying isolates , ESBL production was as high as 84.6 % ( 33 of 39) and 92.3 % ( 36 of 39) of them displayed an MDR phenotype. STs suggested ubiquitous dissemination of mcr-1-carrying pathogens. mcr-1-carrying E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> displayed a lower prevalence and abundant phylogenetic diversity in mainland China. mcr-1-positive E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> showed significant differences in antimicrobial resistance profiles compared with mcr-1-negative E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains , suggesting physicians may consider prescribing different antibiotics when faced with infections caused by mcr-1-positive pathogens.
