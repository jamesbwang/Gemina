  Metal-organic frameworks are of interest for use in a variety of electrochemical and electronic applications , although a detailed understanding of their charge transport behavior , which is of critical importance for enhancing electronic conductivities , remains limited. Herein , we report isolation of the mixed-valence framework materials , Fe ( tri)
