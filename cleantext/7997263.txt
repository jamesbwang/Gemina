  Recent findings of mosaicism ( DNA sequence variation) challenge the dogma that each person has a stable genetic constitution. Copy number variations , point mutations and chromosome abnormalities in normal or diseased tissues have been described. We studied normal skin mosaicism of a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) ( rs1426654 , p.Thr111Ala) in SLC24A5 , an ion transporter gene. This SNP is unusual in that more than 90 % of people of European descent have homozygous germline A/A alleles , while more than 90 % of East Asians and Blacks have homozygous germline G/G alleles. We found mosaicism in neonatal foreskins as well as in 69 % of nearly 600 skin surface scraping samples from 114 donors of different ages. Strikingly , donors with germline ( buccal or blood) A/A , A/G or G/G genotypes had all three sequences ( A/A , A/G or G/G) in the skin surface scrapings. SNP sequence differences extended within the epidermis in the vertical dimension from basal cell layer to the stratum corneum at the surface , as well as across the two-dimensions of the skin surface. Furthermore , repeated scrapings in the same location revealed variation in the sequences in the same individuals over time , adding a fourth dimension to this variation. We then used this mosaicism to track the movement of epidermal cells during normal differentiation and characterize the patterning of epidermal cells during terminal differentiation. In this coordinated proliferation model of epidermal differentiation , the skin surface is alternatively populated by synchronous , cycling of waves of cells , with each group having a different DNA sequence. These groups of cells abruptly flatten into large sheets at the surface providing patches of uniform SNP sequence. This four-dimensional mosaicism is a normal , previously unrecognized form of dynamic mosaicism in human skin.
