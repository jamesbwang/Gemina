  In middle age , declines in executive functioning ( EF) are associated with decrements in the quality and/or quantity of white and grey matter. Recruitment of homologous regions has been identified as a compensatory mechanism for cognitive decline in later middle age; however , research into neural substrates of EF has yet to be guided by dedifferentiation models. We hypothesized that frontal-parietal grey matter volume , interhemispheric white matter , and intrahemispheric white matter fractional anisotropy will be predictive of EF. Further , we hypothesized that the comparative association between interhemispheric white matter and EF will increase with age , because of compensatory recruitment. Neurocognitive test data , DTI , and T1 MPRAGE scans ( n = 444) were obtained from the NKI-Rockland Sample. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship between age , EF , interhemispheric white matter ( forceps minor; FM) , intrahemispheric white matter ( superior longitudinal fasciculus; SLF) , and a frontal-parietal grey matter network. EF and grey matter were modelled as latent variables , with EF examined as the criterion. Additionally , a subsample of participants aged 55 to 85 ( n = 168) was analyzed to examine the influence of age related compensatory mechanisms. There was a significant relationship between FM , grey matter , and EF , which was fully mediated by age. There was a significant relationship between SLF and EF , which was not mediated by age. For older adults , only the age-mediated pathway from FM to EF was significant. Using structural imaging data , support was found for age-related interhemispheric mechanisms of compensation , but not intrahemispheric mechanisms.
