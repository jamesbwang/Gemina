  Self-transmissible mobile genetic elements drive horizontal gene transfer between prokaryotes. Some of these elements integrate in the chromosome , whereas others replicate autonomously as plasmids. Recent works showed the existence of few differences , and occasional interconversion , between the two types of elements. Here , we enquired on why evolutionary processes have maintained the two types of mobile genetic elements by comparing integrative and conjugative elements ( ICE) with extrachromosomal ones ( conjugative plasmids) of the highly abundant MPFT conjugative type. We observed that plasmids encode more replicases , partition systems , and antibiotic resistance genes , whereas ICEs encode more integrases and metabolism-associated genes. ICEs and plasmids have similar average sizes , but plasmids are much more variable , have more DNA repeats , and exchange genes more frequently. On the other hand , we found that ICEs are more frequently transferred between distant taxa. We propose a model where the different genetic plasticity and amplitude of host range between elements explain the co-occurrence of integrative and extra-chromosomal elements in microbial populations. In particular , the conversion from ICE to plasmid allows ICE to be more plastic , while the conversion from plasmid to ICE allows the expansion of the element 's host range.
