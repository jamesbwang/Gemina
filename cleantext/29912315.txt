  Applications to infectious<disease> disease<disease> fellowships have declined nationally; however , the military has not experienced this trend. In the past 6 years , 3 US military programs had 58 applicants for 52 positions. This study examines military resident perceptions to identify potential differences in factors influencing career choice , compared to published data from a nationwide cohort. An existing survey tool was adapted to include questions unique to the training and practice of military medicine. Program directors from 11 military internal medicine residencies were asked to distribute survey links to their graduating residents in Dec 16- Jan 17. Data were categorized by ID interest. Response rate was 51 % ( n = 68). 7 % of respondents were ID applicants , 40 % considered ID but reconsidered , and 53 % were uninterested. 73 % of those who considered ID changed their mind in their PGY-2/ 3 years and cited salary ( 22 %) , lack of procedures ( 18 %) , and training length ( 18 %) as primary deterrents from ID. Active learning styles were more frequently used by ID applicants to learn ID concepts than in those who considered or were uninterested in ID ( p = 0.017). Despite differences in context of training and practice among military trainees compared to civilian colleagues , residents cited similar factors impacting career choice. Interest in global health was higher in this cohort. Salary continues to be identified as a deterrent from ID. Differences between military and civilian residents for or against ID fellowship are likely explained by additional unmeasured factors deserving further study.
