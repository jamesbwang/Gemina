  Amblyomma<pathogen> rotundatum is an ixodid tick strictly associated with cold-blooded animals , among them the toad Rhinella jimi. This work aimed to evaluate the seasonal dynamics of larvae , nymphs , and adults of A. rotundatum parasitizing R. jimi in an area within the semi-arid Caatinga Biome of northeastern Brazil. Monthly sampling from February 2014 to January 2016 resulted in a total of 592 R. jimi toads captured and inspected for infestation by ticks , which were counted and identified. After the procedure , the toads were released with their ticks at the same capture site. During the study period , a total of 658 A. rotundatum were counted , comprising 497 larvae , 110 nymphs , and 51 females. The two-year mean abundances of larvae , nymphs , and adults were 0.84 , 0.19 , and 0.09 , respectively. The two-year mean infestation intensities of larvae , nymphs , and adults were 3.65 , 1.45 , and 1.34 , respectively. Comparing the monthly values of prevalence , mean abundance , and mean infestation intensity of A. rotundatum life stages , differences were observed between the first and second year of study; however , with no clear seasonal pattern.
