  Head and neck malignancies have always been challenging for the clinician , both with regards to locoregional control and distant metastasis. Aggressive approaches translate to an acceptable locoregional control , but distant failures pose a dilemma. Newer , sophisticated , imaging modalities have helped in early diagnosis of solitary metastasis , and in turn have opened up an array of interventional procedures , which to some extent improve the disease-free survival and quality of life , as was seen in the present case of locoregionally controlled advanced hypopharyngeal malignancy who presented with solitary distant metastasis. Still , diligent care needs to be taken not to aggravate the scenario with these interventions.
