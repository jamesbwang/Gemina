  Predicting hyperglycemic crisis death ( PHD) score is a simple , rapid tool with six independent mortality predictors to calculate 30-day mortality and appropriately dispose patients to Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) or ward. This study aimed at validating the efficiency of PHD score as a decision rule for prognosticating 30-day mortality and classifying hyperglycemic crisis patients for appropriate disposition from the emergency department ( ED). This is a prospective , observational study done in the ED of a teaching hospital over 14 months. All patients aged > 18 years and who met the criteria of hyperglycemic crisis were enrolled. Thirty-day mortality of six independent predictors was the primary end point. Using PHD , risk scores were calculated and patients were disposed as per physician 's clinical judgment. Finally , the treating physician 's decision and PHD score disposition were compared and the efficiency of PHD in predicting 30-day mortality was analyzed. Multiple logistic regression models were used for analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn , and area under the curve along with sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value was analyzed. A total of 133 patients were included. On applying PHD score , 69 , 39 , and 25 patients were in the low- , intermediate- , and high-risk groups , respectively , with a mortality rate of 5.8 % , 20.5 % , and 56 % , respectively. On comparing physician disposition with PHD score , an increasing mortality was noticed in ICU , and PHD showed equal weight in risk stratification and appropriate disposition of patients. In adult patients with hyperglycemic crisis , PHD score is validated as a straightforward , prompt tool for predicting 30-day mortality and aids in disposition. The mortality rate in the PHD score Model II was similar to the physician 's clinical decision.
