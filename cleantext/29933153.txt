  Aptamers could be used to construct simple and effective biosensor because the conformational switch of aptamer upon target binding is easy to be transferred to optical or electrochemical signals. Nevertheless , we found that the binding between saxitoxin ( STX) and aptamer ( M-30f) is not accompanied with conformational switch. Here , the circular dichroism spectra , fluorophore and quencher labeled aptamer , and crystal violet-based assays were used to identify the binding way between STX and aptamer. The results show that the conformation of aptamer is stabilized in PBS buffer ( 10 mM phosphate buffer , 2.7 mM KCl , 137 mM NaCl , pH 7.4) and this conformation may provide an exactly suitable cave for STX binding. Through the analysis of UV-melting curves and circular dichroism-melting curves , it is found that different concentrations of STX produce different unfolding extents of the aptamer under high temperature. Then , a simple temperature-assisted `` turn-on '' fluorescent aptasensor was developed to detect STX and the application in real sample detection demonstrates its feasibility. The proposed method provides not only an alternative for STX detection but also a strategy for simple aptasensor design using aptamers that do not switch conformation upon targets binding.
