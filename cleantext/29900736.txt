  Electrolytes based on sulfolane ( SL) solvents and lithium bis ( oxalato) borate ( LiBOB) chelato-borate complexes have been reported many times for use in advanced lithium-ion batteries due to their many advantages. This study aims to clarify the active mechanism of the interphase film-forming process to optimize the properties of these batteries by experimental analysis and theoretical calculations. The results indicate that the self-repairing film-forming process during the first cycle is divided into three stages: the initial film formation with an electric field force of ∼ 1.80 V , the further growth of the preformation solid electrolyte interphase ( SEI) film at ∼ 1.73 V , and the final formation of a complete SEI film at a potential below 0.7 V. Additionally , we can deduce that the decomposition of LiBOB and SL occurs throughout nearly the entire process of the formation of the SEI film. The decomposition product of BOB
