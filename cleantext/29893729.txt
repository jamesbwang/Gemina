  Organic micropollutants , in particular those of anthropogenic origin , may have a toxic influence on water organisms. Photochemical oxidation processes are one of the most effective methods of decomposition of a wide range of those compounds. During the oxidation process a large number of different by-products are generated , which can still be biologically active. The development of analytical techniques , including the reduction of the detection limit to several fg/L , allows the identification of even trace concentrations of compounds. The paper presents the determination of pentachlorophenol and benzo ( a) pyrene degradation pathways during the process of heterogeneous photocatalysis carried out in the presence of titanium dioxide. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS) analysis of post-processing samples indicated the formation of different by-products of the parent micropollutants. Moreover , the toxicity assessment demonstrates for both tested micropollutants an increase in the toxicity within the whole time of the UV irradiation process run.
