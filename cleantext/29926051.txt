  A biosensor based on Hg ( ii) nanoladders integrated with graphene oxide ( GO) for Hg ( ii) detection was developed. Nanoladders were essentially DNA sandwich structures supported by T-Hg ( ii)- T and were used for Hg ( ii) trapping and signal translation. GO was used to differentiate the fluorescence generated by Hg ( ii) nanoladders from a background signal.
