  Transradial access for cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention is recommended by international guidelines to reduce vascular complications. Unfortunately , some factors such as female sex , shorter body surface area and older age , were found to be independent predictors of transradial cardiac catheterization failure. The balloon-assisted tracking technique is a smart trick to avoid crossover from radial to femoral access in case of spasm , tortuosity , or stenosis.
