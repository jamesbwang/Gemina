  Standard audiometric evaluations are not sensitive enough to identify hidden hearing loss ( HHL) and/or cochlear synaptopathy ( CS). Patients with either of these conditions frequently present with difficulty understanding speech in noise or other complaints such as tinnitus<symptom>. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify articles in peer-reviewed journals that assessed the sensitivity of audiologic measures for detecting HHL and/or CS , and which showed potential for use in a clinical test battery for these disorders. A reference librarian submitted specific boolean terminology to MEDLINE , Embase , and Web of Science. The authors used a consensus approach with specially designed score sheets for the selection of titles , abstracts , and then articles for inclusion in the systematic review and for quality assessment. Fifteen articles were included in the systematic review. Seven articles involved humans; seven involved animals , and one study used both humans and animals. Results showed that pure-tone audiometry to 20 kHz , otoacoustic emissions , electrocochleography , auditory brainstem response ( ABR) , electrophysiological tests , speech recognition in noise with and without temporal distortion , interviews , and self-report measures have been used to assess HHL and/or CS. For HHL , ultra-high-frequency audiometry may help identify persons with sensory hair cell loss that does not show up on standard audiograms. Promising nonbehavioral measures for CS included ABR wave I amplitude , the summating potential-to-action potential ratio , and speech recognition in noise with and without temporal distortion. Self-report questionnaires also may help identify auditory dysfunction in persons with normal hearing.
