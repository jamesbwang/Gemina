  To determine the changes in each of the five dimensions of the EuroQol 5-dimension index associated with community-based physiotherapy. Four thousand one hundred and thirty-six patients that received community-based musculoskeletal physiotherapy across five NHS centres completed the EQ-5D on entry into the service and upon discharge. Patients were categorised on symptom location and response to treatment based on their EQ-5D index improving by at least 0.1 ( `` EQ-5D responders ''). For each symptom location , and for responders and non-responders to treatment , the mean ( Â± SD) were calculated for each dimension pre- and post-treatment as well as the size of effect. The mobility dimension improved ( p < 0.05) in all symptom locations for EQ-5D responders ( d = 0.26-1.58) and in ankle , knee , hip and lumbar symptoms for EQ-5D non-responders ( d = 0.17-0.45). The self-care dimension improved ( p < 0.05) in all symptom locations for EQ-5D responders ( d = 0.49-1.16). The usual activities dimension improved ( p < 0.05) across all symptom locations for EQ-5D responders ( d = 1.00-1.75) and EQ-5D non-responders ( d = 0.14-0.60). Despite the pain/discomfort dimension improving ( p < 0.05) across all symptom locations for both EQ-5D responders ( d = 1.07-1.43) and EQ-5D non-responders ( d = 0.29-0.66) , the anxiety/depression dimension improved ( p < 0.05) from higher starting levels in EQ-5D responders ( d = 0.76-1.05) with no change seen for EQ-5D non-responders ( d =- 0.16 to 0.06). Clinicians should not assume that a patient presenting with pain but expressing high anxiety/depression is unlikely to respond to treatment , as they may show the best HRQoL outcomes. For patients presenting with pain/discomfort and low levels of anxiety/depression , the EQ-5D index is perhaps not a suitable tool for sole use in patient management and service evaluation.
