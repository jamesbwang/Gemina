  It is commonly accepted to consider retroperitoneal germ cell tumors as the metastasis of a viable or burned-out testicular tumor. In such cases , orchiectomy should be performed since the burned-out site in the testis could continue to harbor malignancy despite systemic chemotherapy. A 45-year-old male presented as an outpatient with complaints of back pain. He was diagnosed with a retroperitoneal mass and a palpable testis mass. He underwent radical orchiectomy. Pathological study revealed a burned-out tumor. Following chemotherapy , retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was performed. Despite the residual and enhanced retroperitoneal lymph nodes in his computed tomography scan , none of the resected lymph nodes showed a viable tumor. This is the first reported case of a palpable and hypoechoic burned-out testicular tumor.
