  Oral-nasogastric feeding tubes ( FTs) are often malpositioned , placing infants at risk for complications. Confusion<symptom> exists regarding the accuracy of methods to determine FT insertion length and verify gastric FT placement , and it is unknown whether evidence-based methods are used by neonatal nurses. To compare individual and unit-based neonatal nursing practices regarding methods used to determine FT insertion length and verify gastric FT placement. Neonatal nurses were surveyed about individual and unit-based practices regarding methods used to determine FT insertion length and verify gastric FT placement in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Sixty neonatal nurses completed the survey , with 63 % utilizing the nose-ear-midway to the umbilicus method , which was included in 50 % of protocols and is associated with up to a 90 % accuracy rate. Although it has an unacceptably high inaccuracy rate , the nose-to-ear-to-xiphoid method was used by 32 % of nurses and recommended in 30 % of protocols. To verify gastric FT placement , 98 % of nurses used auscultation of a whoosh sound<symptom> and 83 % used aspiration of gastric contents. Neither verification method is supported by evidence or recommended for use. A lack of consistency exists between nursing practice and evidence-based methods. Research is needed to determine more accurate and reliable ways to determine FT insertion depth and verify gastric FT placement in neonates.
