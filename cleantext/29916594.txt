  As Genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of genes , exposomics refers to the totality of lifetime environmental exposures , consisting in a novel approach to studying the role of the environment in human<disease> disease<disease>. The aim is to assess all human environmental and occupational exposures in order to better understand their contribution to human<disease> diseases<disease>. The `` omics '' revolution infact mostly regards the underlying method: scientific knowledge is expected to come from the analysis of increasingly extensive databases. The primary focus is on air pollution and water contaminants , but all the determinants of human exposure are conceptually part of the idea of exposome , including physical and psychological factors. Using ` omic ' techniques the collected exposure data can be linked to biochemical and molecular changes in our body. Since the first formulation of the idea itself of Exposome many efforts have been made to translate the concept into research , in particular two important studies have been started in Europe. We herein suggest that Occupational Medicine could be a precious contributor to the growth of exposure science also in its omic side thanks to the methods and to the knowledges part of our background.
