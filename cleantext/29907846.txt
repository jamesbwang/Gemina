  Iron deficiency ( ID) is common in overweight and obese individuals ( OW/OB) but the mechanism is uncertain. Greater blood volume ( BV) in OW/OB may increase hemoglobin ( Hb) mass and iron requirements , and confound iron biomarkers by hemodilution. Quantification of BV/PV changes in OW/OB is challenging and a formula to estimate BV/PV based on anthropometric indices would be valuable. In normal weight ( NW) and OW/OB women , we aimed at: ( 1) measure BV and assess whether differences in BV affect concentrations and total circulating mass of Hb and iron biomarkers; ( 2) develop an algorithm describing BV in OW/OB. In a cross-sectional study , we measured BV in NW , OW , and OB non-anemic women ( n = 62) by using the carbon monoxide-rebreathing method , body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry , and iron and inflammatory status. OW and OB women had 11 and 16 % higher mean BV and PV compared to NW ( P < 0.05) , respectively. In OW/OB compared to NW , total circulating masses of IL-6 , hepcidin , Hb , and sTfR were higher , while total mass of serum iron was lower ( for all , P < 0.05). An equation including height , body mass and lean mass to estimate BV in all BMI groups ( R An equation based on anthropometric indices provides a good estimate of increased BV in OW/OB women. In OW/OB women , there is an increase in Hb mass that likely increases iron requirements for erythropoiesis and circulating TfR mass. At the same time , higher hepcidin concentrations may lower serum iron mass. Both these mechanisms may increase risk for ID in OW/OB women.
