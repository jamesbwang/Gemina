  Air ambulances rapidly transport burn patients to regional centers , expediting treatment. However , limited guidelines on transport introduce the risk for inappropriate triage and overuse. Given the additional costs of air vs ground transport , evaluation of transportation use is prudent. A retrospective review of all burn patients transported by helicopter to a single burn center from May 2013 to January 2016 was performed. Data gathered included patient demographics , transfer origin , burn characteristics , and inpatient hospital stay. The primary outcome was appropriate triage based on literature-derived severity criteria. Secondary outcomes included independent predictors of emergent treatments and the cost of overuse. Sixty-eight patients were examined , of which 66 % met air ambulance criteria. Inappropriately triaged patients sustained smaller burns ( % TBSA 4.8 vs 25.3 , P < .001) , had fewer flame burns ( 48 vs 82 % , P = .007) , had decreased lengths of stay ( mean days 8.2 vs 21.2 , P = .002) , underwent fewer inpatient surgeries ( mean 0.69 vs 2.57 , P = .006) , received no emergent procedures ( 0 vs 56 % , P < .001) , and suffered no deaths ( 0 vs 9 % , P < .001). Independent predictors of emergent procedures included transport for airway concern ( odds ratio = 45.29 , confidence interval = 2.49-825.21 , P = .010) and % TBSA ( odds ratio = 1.13 , confidence interval = 1.02-1.27 , P = .019). If the 23 inappropriately triaged patients had been transported by ground , a cost savings of $ 106,370 could have been realized using 2016 California Medicare reimbursements ( per-patient savings of $ 4624). While appropriate in most circumstances , the cost of air ambulances should be weighed in light of their utility , as a significant proportion of patients did not benefit from air transport.
