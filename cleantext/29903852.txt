  Human allografts for life-threatening organ<symptom> failure<symptom> have been demonstrated to be lifesaving and are now considered to be standard of care for many conditions. Transplantation of non-vital anatomic body parts has also been accomplished. Hand transplantation after limb<symptom> loss<symptom> in adults has been shown to offer some promising benefits in both functional and psychological measures in preliminary studies. It has been suggested to expand eligibility criteria to include minors , with one such operation having already been performed. With this in mind , we examine the current state of hand transplantation research in the context of available alternatives. We examine the ethics of carrying out these operations in minors , including under the protections of clinical research. We argue that children should not be considered for this surgery due to the substantial risks of immunosuppressive medication , the likelihood that the graft will need to be replaced during the patient 's lifetime and the lack of significant compensatory advantages over modern prosthetics.
