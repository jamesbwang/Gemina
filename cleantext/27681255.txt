  The problem of effective immobilization of liquid radioactive waste ( LRW) is key to the successful development of nuclear energy. The possibility of using the magnesium potassium phosphate ( MKP) compound for LRW immobilization on the example of nitric acid solutions containing actinides and rare earth elements ( REE) , including high level waste ( HLW) surrogate solution , is considered in the research work. Under the study of phase composition and structure of the MKP compounds that is obtained by the XRD and SEM methods , it was established that the compounds are composed of crystalline phases-- analogues of natural phosphate minerals ( struvite , metaankoleite). The hydrolytic stability of the compounds was determined according to the semi-dynamic test GOST R 52126-2003. Low leaching rates of radionuclides from the compound are established , including a differential leaching rate of
