  Novel pyrimidinic selenoureas were synthesized and evaluated against tumour and normal cell lines. Among these , the compound named 3j initially showed relevant cytotoxicity and selectivity for tumour cells. Three analogues of 3j were designed and synthesized keeping in view the structural requirements of this compound. Almost all the tested compounds displayed considerable cytotoxicity. However , 8a , one of the 3j analogues , was shown to be highly selective and cytotoxic , especially for breast carcinoma cells ( MCF-7) ( IC
