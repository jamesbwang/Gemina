  The Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire ( PSDQ) is used worldwide to assess three styles ( authoritative , authoritarian , and permissive) and seven dimensions of parenting. In this study , we adapted the short version of the PSDQ for use in Brazil and investigated its validity and reliability. Participants were 451 mothers of children aged 3 to 18 years , though sample size varied with analyses. The translation and adaptation of the PSDQ followed a rigorous methodological approach. Then , we investigated the content , criterion , and construct validity of the adapted instrument. The scale content validity index ( S-CVI) was considered adequate ( 0.97). There was evidence of internal validity , with the PSDQ dimensions showing strong correlations with their higher-order parenting styles. Confirmatory factor analysis endorsed the three-factor , second-order solution ( i.e. , three styles consisting of seven dimensions). The PSDQ showed convergent validity with the validated Brazilian version of the Parenting Styles Inventory ( Invent√°rio de Estilos Parentais- IEP) , as well as external validity , as it was associated with several instruments measuring sociodemographic and behavioral/emotional-problem variables. The PSDQ is an effective and reliable psychometric instrument to assess childrearing strategies according to Baumrind 's model of parenting styles.
