  Cisplatin ( CisPt) is one of the most effective antitumor drugs against a wide range of solid cancers , and recent studies have indicated that combination of CisPt and RNA interference ( RNAi) agents would effectively enhance therapeutic index , while the development of simple yet robust dual-delivery systems still remains a challenge. Here , we demonstrated that platinated graphene oxide is an excellent platform to achieve such goal. Nano-Graphene oxide ( NGO) was easily platinated by CisPt , and the resulting CisPt/NGO was characterized by several aspects. As a proof-of-concept , an antisense microRNA-21 ( Anti-miR-21) was employed as a potential RNAi agent. While most previous work functionalized NGO with cationic polymers for gene delivery , we demonstrated that platinated NGO is a potent carrier to load Anti-miR-21 with improved capacity and adsorption stability. With Anti-miR-21 loading , the system displayed significantly enhanced cytotoxicity to cancer cells , suggesting a synergistic effect. Finally , the underlying mechanism of the improved efficacy was explored , which can be ascribed to the cell apoptosis induced by Anti-miR-21 for gene silencing. This work demonstrated platinated graphene oxide as an effective nanocarrier to co-deliver CisPt and gene therapy for the treatment of cancer.
