  In major modern reef regions , either in the Indo-Pacific or the Caribbean , scleractinian corals are described as the main reef framework builders , often associated with crustose coralline algae<pathogen>. We used underwater cores to investigate Late Holocene reef growth and characterise the main framework builders in the Abrolhos Shelf , the largest and richest modern tropical reef complex in the South Western Atlantic , a scientifically underexplored reef province. Rather than a typical coralgal reef , our results show a complex framework building system dominated by bryozoans. Bryozoans were major components in all cores and age intervals ( 2,000 yrs BP) , accounting for up to 44 % of the reef framework , while crustose coralline algae<pathogen> and coral accounted for less than 28 and 23 % , respectively. Reef accretion rates varied from 2.7 to 0.9 mm yr
