  This paper presents a systematic literature review concerning 3D segmentation algorithms for computerized tomographic imaging. This analysis covers articles published in the range 2006-March 2018 found in four scientific databases ( Science Direct , IEEEXplore , ACM , and PubMed) , using the methodology for systematic review proposed by Kitchenham. We present the analyzed segmentation methods categorized according to its application , algorithmic strategy , validation , and use of prior knowledge , as well as its general conceptual description. Additionally , we present a general overview , discussions , and further prospects for the 3D segmentation methods applied for tomographic images.
