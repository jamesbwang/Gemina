  High intake of vitamin A is suspected to be a risk factor for the progression of Stargardt disease ( STGD1) and many health authorities recommend Stargardt patients not to use oral vitamin A supplements outside that provided naturally in the food. The present study provides the first systematic review of the current level of evidence regarding the role of supplementary vitamin A in STGD1. We conducted a systematic scientific literature search in the Pubmed database on studies reporting on the effect of oral vitamin A or serum retinol on visual function. In animal studies neither high nor low serum retinol in an Abca4 knockout mouse model of Stargardt showed any effect on electroretinography ( ERG). In humans , significantly better visual function was reported in a cross-sectional study of patients with a low dietary intake of vitamin A , whereas a prospective study did not find any correlation between vitamin A supplementation and visual acuity. A newly introduced vitamin A substitute ( C20-D ( 3)- vitamin A) has shown promising effects on ERG in a Stargardt mouse model. There are few studies on the effect of vitamin A in STGD1. The scarcity and inconclusiveness of evidence available impel further research efforts to reach a more confident conclusion. Currently , recommendations to avoid vitamin A dietary supplementation rely mainly on a theoretical background. Animal studies on vitamin A substitute as a possible therapeutic approach in preventing or slowing vision loss<symptom> in STGD1 seems promising but further clinical trials are needed to verify the results.
