  Diversity is a central requirement for the immune system 's capacity to adequately clear a variety of different infections. As such , natural killer ( NK) cells represent a highly diverse population of innate lymphocytes important in the early response against viruses. Yet , the extent to which a chronic pathogen affects NK cell diversity is largely unknown. Here we study NK cell functional diversification in chronic hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection. High-dimensional flow cytometer assays combined with stochastic neighbor embedding analysis reveal that chronic HCV<pathogen> infection induces functional imprinting on human NK cells that is largely irreversible and persists long after successful interventional clearance of the virus. Furthermore , HCV<pathogen> infection increases inter-individual , but decreases intra-individual , NK cell diversity. Taken together , our results provide insights into how the history of infections affects human NK cell diversity.
