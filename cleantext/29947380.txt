  Nanostructures of bismuth selenide ( Bi2Se3) , a 3D topological insulator material , and nickel ( Ni) doped Bi2Se3 samples were prepared by a hydrothermal method to explore the field emission properties. An enrichment in the field electron emission ( FE) properties in terms of the threshold and turn-on field values of Bi2Se3 and Ni doped Bi2Se3 nanostructures was measured at a base pressure of ∼ 1 × 10-8 mbar. Using the background of the Fowler-Nordheim ( FN) theory a field enhancement factor ( β) of 5.7 × 103 and a threshold field value of 2.5 V μm-1 for 7.5 % Ni doped Bi2Se3 were determined by investigating the J-E plot of the FE data. The value of β is three times higher than that of pure Bi2Se3 confirming the superior FE properties. The emission current was found to be very stable with the property of long standing durability as a negligible amount of variation was observed when measured at a constant value of 5 mA for 3 hours. The experimental results signify many opportunities for potential applications of Ni doped Bi2Se3 as a source of electrons in scanning as well as transmission electron microscopy , flat panel displays and as an X-ray generator , etc..
