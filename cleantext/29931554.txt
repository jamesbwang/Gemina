  Arterial stiffness is a marker of cardiovascular damage and an independent predictor of major cardiovascular events , usually assessed via Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity ( cfPWV). The aim of this study was to test the feasibility and usefulness of aortic strain analysis using a simplified transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE) speckle-tracking ( ST) based method. 60 consecutive patients with normal blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and aortic dimensions underwent TTE and cfPWV evaluation. Strain analysis was performed on the largest section of the ascending aorta ( aA) with a dedicated software; three couples of speckles were identified within the anterior and posterior aortic wall and transverse segments connecting each couple traced. Peak ascending Aorta Strain ( PaAS) was defined as the averaged peak percentage deformation of these segments during the cardiac cycle; aortic stiffness index Î²
