  Information can be consolidated into visual working memory in parallel , i.e. two items can be consolidated in the same time required to consolidate one. However , while motion direction items consolidated in parallel are encoded at a reduced precision , no such reduction has been reported for colour. Here we examine two possible explanations for the inconsistency between the phenomena associated with consolidating these features in parallel: i) that reduced precision can only be detected when more than two colour items are consolidated in parallel , or ii) that the exposure duration used in previous studies was too long , allowing observers serially consolidate items. Our results show that ( like motion direction) colour items consolidated in parallel are encoded at a reduced precision and the critical feature for detecting this phenomenon is the exposure duration. Furthermore , we demonstrate that this process is limited to two items. These findings indicate a general principle of consolidation into visual working memory , that is , a trade-off between the number of items consolidated in parallel and the precision at which they are encoded.
