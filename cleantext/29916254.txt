  Triacylglycerol lipases have recently been shown to be transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere in atmospheric sea spray aerosol ( SSA). Lipases have the potential to alter the composition of SSA; however , the structure and properties of enzymes in the high salt , high ionic strength , and low pH conditions found in SSA have never been explored. Here , we study the dynamics of Burkholderia<pathogen> cepacia<pathogen> triacylglycerol lipase ( BCL) at SSA model surfaces comprised of palmitic acid and dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid ( DPPA) , two commonly found lipids at SSA surfaces. Surface adsorption Langmuir isotherm experiments and all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations together illuminate how and why BCL expands the ordering of lipids at palmitic acid surfaces the most at pH < 4 and the least in DPPA surfaces at pH 6. Taken together , these results represent a first glimpse into the complex interplay between lipid surface structure and protein dynamics within enzyme-containing aerosols.
