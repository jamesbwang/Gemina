  An advanced technique for multiple breath-hold volumetric modulated arc therapy ( VMAT) has been proposed under fluoroscopic image guidance with a fiducial marker implanted close to a tumor. The marker coordinates on a digitally reconstructed radiography image at a gantry start angle , under a planned breath-hold condition , were transferred to the fluoroscopic image window. Then , a reference lateral line passing through the planned breath-hold marker position was drawn on the fluoroscopic image. Additional lateral lines were further added on both sides of the reference line with a distance of 3 mm as a tolerance limit for the breath-hold beam delivery. Subsequently , the patient was asked to breathe in slowly under fluoroscopy. Immediately after the marker position on the fluoroscopic image moved inside the tolerance range , the patient was asked to hold the breath and the VMAT beam was delivered. During the beam delivery , the breath-hold status was continuously monitored by checking if the deviation of the marker position exceeded the tolerance limit. As long as the marker stayed within the tolerance range , a segmented VMAT delivery continued for a preset period of 15 to 30 seconds depending on the breath-hold capability of each patient. As soon as each segmented delivery was completed , the beam interrupt button was pushed; subsequently , the patient was asked for free breathing. This procedure was repeated until all the segmented VMAT beams were delivered. A lung tumor case is reported here as an initial study. The proposed technique may be clinically advantageous for treating respiratory moving tumors including lung tumor , liver cancer , and other abdominal cancers.
