  An organocatalytic enantioselective intramolecular aza-Michael reaction has been described for the first time in a desymmetrization process employing substrates different from cyclohexadienones. By using 9-amino-9-deoxy-epi-hydroquinine as the catalyst and trifluoroacetic acid as a co-catalyst , a series of enantiomerically enriched 2,5-and 2,6-disubstituted piperidines have been obtained in good yields and with moderate diastereoselectivity. Depending on the catalyst/co-catalyst loading ratio , either the major or the minor diastereoisomer of the final piperidine products was achieved with high levels of enantioselectivity. Finally , some mechanistic insights have been considered by means of theoretical calculations which were in agreement with the experimental results obtained in the desymmetrization reaction.
