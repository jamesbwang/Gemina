  Of nine ependymoma molecular groups detected by DNA methylation profiling , the posterior fossa type A ( PFA) is most prevalent. We used DNA methylation profiling to look for further molecular heterogeneity among 675 PFA ependymomas. Two major subgroups , PFA-1 and PFA-2 , and nine minor subtypes were discovered. Transcriptome profiling suggested a distinct histogenesis for PFA-1 and PFA-2 , but their clinical parameters were similar. In contrast , PFA subtypes differed with respect to age at diagnosis , gender ratio , outcome , and frequencies of genetic alterations. One subtype , PFA-1c , was enriched for 1q gain and had a relatively poor outcome , while patients with PFA-2c ependymomas showed an overall survival at 5 years of > 90 %. Unlike other ependymomas , PFA-2c tumors express high levels of OTX2 , a potential biomarker for this ependymoma subtype with a good prognosis. We also discovered recurrent mutations among PFA ependymomas. H3 K27M mutations were present in 4.2 % , occurring only in PFA-1 tumors , and missense mutations in an uncharacterized gene , CXorf67 , were found in 9.4 % of PFA ependymomas , but not in other groups. We detected high levels of wildtype or mutant CXorf67 expression in all PFA subtypes except PFA-1f , which is enriched for H3 K27M mutations. PFA ependymomas are characterized by lack of H3 K27 trimethylation ( H3 K27-me3) , and we tested the hypothesis that CXorf67 binds to PRC2 and can modulate levels of H3 K27-me3. Immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry detected EZH2 , SUZ12 , and EED , core components of the PRC2 complex , bound to CXorf67 in the Daoy cell line , which shows high levels of CXorf67 and no expression of H3 K27-me3. Enforced reduction of CXorf67 in Daoy cells restored H3 K27-me3 levels , while enforced expression of CXorf67 in HEK293T and neural stem cells reduced H3 K27-me3 levels. Our data suggest that heterogeneity among PFA ependymomas could have clinicopathologic utility and that CXorf67 may have a functional role in these tumors.
