  Interstitial hernias are a rare subtype of abdominal hernias , where sac is present in between the abdominal wall layers. Although , difficult to diagnose clinically , they are usually detected on imaging studies. Interstitial hernias presenting with undescended testis are common. Even after a meticulous online search of the medical literature , we could not find a case report of ` Strangulation of Interstitial hernia , with a strangulated undescended testis in an elderly man. We hereby present this extremely rare case , and possibly , this could be the first of its kind , case report in the medical literature. Our aim is to present a combination of rare presentations in an elderly cryptorchid person with strangulated interstitial hernia. A 65-year male patient presented with 4 days of pain abdomen and vomiting<symptom>. He was having features of toxaemia. Ultrasonography revealed interstitial hernia with bowel loops. During surgery , gangrenous bowel loops with the sac between the interstitial planes , with strangulated cryptorchid testis , were found. Strangulated interstitial hernia in elderly cryptorchid person , leading to the strangulation of the undescended testis , is extremely rare , and this could be the first case reported in the medical literature.
