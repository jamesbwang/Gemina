  A decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) is reportedly associated with increased prevalence rates of cognitive impairment. However , data concerning the association between the cerebral saturation of oxygen ( rSO2) and cognitive function of patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is limited. This study aimed to ( i) elucidate the clinical factors associating with cerebral rSO2 and ( ii) investigate the association between cerebral rSO2 and cognitive assessment in CKD patients. A total of 40 CKD patients not requiring dialysis ( 26 men and 14 women; mean age , 61.0 ± 2.7 years) were recruited. The numbers of patients at each CKD stage were as follows: G1 , 5; G2 , 8; G3a , 6; G3b , 5; G4 , 11; and G5 , 5. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored at the forehead using the oxygen saturation monitor INVOS 5100C. The cognitive function of each patient was confirmed using the Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE). Cerebral rSO2 levels were significantly higher in CKD patients than in hemodialysis patients ( 63.8 ± 1.5 % vs. 44.9 ± 2.2 % , p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with eGFR ( standardized coefficient: 0.530) , serum albumin concentration ( standardized coefficient: 0.365) , and serum sodium concentration ( standardized coefficient: 0.224). Furthermore , MMSE showed a significantly positive correlation with cerebral rSO2 ( r = 0.624 , p < 0.001). Cerebral rSO2 was affected by eGFR and serum albumin and sodium concentrations in CKD patients. Furthermore , cerebral rSO2 monitoring , which reflected MMSE scores , might be a useful method for assessing cognitive function in CKD patients.
