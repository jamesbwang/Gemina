  Magnetic nanocellulose alginate hydrogel beads are produced from the assembly of alginate and magnetic nanocellulose ( m-CNCs) as a potential drug delivery system. The m-CNCs were synthesized from cellulose nanocrystals ( CNCs) that were isolated from rice husks ( RH) by co-precipitation method and were incorporated into alginate-based hydrogel beads with the aim of enhancing mechanical strength and regulating drug release behavior. Ibuprofen was chosen as a model drug. The prepared CNCs , m-CNCs and the alginate hydrogel beads were characterized by various physicochemical techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , scanning electron microscope ( SEM) and vibrating sample magnetometer studies ( VSM). Besides the magnetic property , the presence of m-CNCs increased the integrity of the alginate hydrogel beads and the swelling percentage. The drug release study exhibited a controlled release profiles and based on the drug release data , the drug release mechanism was analyzed and discussed based on mathematical models such as Korsmeyer-Peppas and Peppas-Sahlin.
