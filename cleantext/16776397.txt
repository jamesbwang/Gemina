  Occupational engagement is the foundation of occupational therapy. We identified perspectives of 18 occupational therapy practitioners on integrating occupation-based interventions during postacute care ( PAC) rehabilitation for persons with hip fracture to identify occupational therapy 's distinct contribution. We conducted six focus groups derived from a purposive national sample of occupational therapy practitioners ( N = 18). A secondary analysis was conducted to analyze the transcripts for major subthemes around occupation-based interventions. Three major themes arose from practitioners ' perspectives regarding the role of occupation in rehabilitation: ( 1) conducting an occupational profile , ( 2) integrating occupation-based intervention in the facility , and ( 3) identifying goals for occupational engagement after discharge. Challenges and strategies for integrating occupation-based interventions were also identified. Identifying practitioners ' perspectives on integrating occupation into rehabilitation may inform strategies to facilitate occupation-based interventions in PAC and define occupational therapy 's role in this setting.
