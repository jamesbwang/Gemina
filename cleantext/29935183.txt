  1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1,2,3,6-Tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP) is a neurotoxin that causes Parkinson 's disease in animals via mechanisms linked with oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom>. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol and a phytoalexin with antioxidative and antiinflammatory properties. Here , we investigated the rescue role of resveratrol on MPTP-triggered toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster for the first time. D. melanogaster ( Harwich strain , 1-to 3- days old) were first orally exposed to resveratrol ( 0 , 7.5 , 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 mg/kg diet) and MPTP ( 0 , 250 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , and 3000 μM) for longevity and 7 days survival assays respectively. Consequently , we selected resveratrol ( 30 and 60 mg/kg diet) to evaluate its rescue role on MPTP ( 250 and 500 μM)- induced toxicity in D. melanogaster after 3 days of oral treatment. Specifically , we evaluated markers of neurotoxicity ( acetylcholinesterase and negative geotaxis) , inflammation<symptom> ( nitric oxide) , oxidative stress-antioxidant status ( hydrogen peroxide , total thiol , catalase and glutathione-S-transferase) , cell viability and fecundity. The data showed that resveratrol increased lifespan of D. melanogaster in a dose-dependent manner up to 60 mg/kg diet. Further , resveratrol restored MPTP-induced inhibition of catalase , glutathione-S-transferase and acetylcholinesterase activities in D. melanogaster. Moreover , resveratrol ameliorated MPTP-triggered cell death , histological alterations , behavioural deficits and accumulation of nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide levels in flies ( p < 0.05). Conclusively , the lifespan extension effects of resveratrol and its rescue role on MPTP- mediated toxicity in the flies may be due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
