  Monoacylglycerol lipases ( MGLs) are enzymes that hydrolyze monoacylglycerol into a free fatty acid and glycerol. Fatty acids can be used for triacylglycerol synthesis , as energy source , as building blocks for energy storage , and as precursor for membrane phospholipids. In Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> , fatty acids also serve as precursor for polyketide lipids like mycolic acids , major components of the cellular envelope associated to resistance for drug. We present the crystal structure of the MGL Rv0183 from Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> ( mtbMGL) in open conformation. The structure reveals remarkable similarities with MGL from humans ( hMGL) in both , the cap region and the α/β core. Nevertheless , mtbMGL could not be inhibited with JZL-184 , a known inhibitor of hMGL. Docking studies provide an explanation why the activity of mtbMGL was not affected by the inhibitor. Our findings suggest that specific inhibition of mtbMGL from Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> , one of the oldest recognized pathogens , is possible without influencing hMGL.
