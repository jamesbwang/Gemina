  The Lactococcus<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> is known as a probiotic bacterium<pathogen> and also as a producer of nisin. Nisin has been approved by related legal agencies to be used as an antimicrobial peptide in food preservation. In fact , the L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> is present in different food products along with other micro-organisms especially pathogenic bacteria. So , it is important to predict the behavior of nisin-producer strain in contact with other pathogens. In this regard , nisin gene expression and the level of secreted biologically active form of nisin by L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> subsp. lactis<pathogen> in modified MRS broth and whey solution in co-culture with Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> or Salmonella<pathogen> enterica<pathogen> were studied. The nisin concentration was determined by microbiological assay method and the transcription level of nisin gene was assayed through quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( RT-qPCR). According to our results , the highest concentration of nisin and its gene transcription level were detected in mono- and co-cultures after 16 h of incubation , concurrent with the end of L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> exponential phase of growth. The nisin mRNA copies in co-cultures were higher than mono-cultures only at 16 h of incubation. But , differences between nisin concentrations in mono- and co-cultures were significant at 16 , 24 h and at 12 , 16 , 24 h of incubation in the modified MRS medium and whey solution , respectively. This incompatibility could be related to the low availability of components required for nisin precursor modification , transportation and processing in mono-cultures. Overall , the L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> produced more mature and active nisin when it was in contact with pathogenic bacteria.
