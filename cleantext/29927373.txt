  A dramatic increase in OXA-48 β-lactamase was observed recently not only in large hospital centres , but also in smaller suburban hospital centres in geographic areas bordering Croatia. The aim of the study was to analyse the epidemiology , the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and the routes of spread of OXA-48 carbapenemase in Croatia. Carbapenemase and other β-lactamase and fluoroquinolone resistance genes were detected by PCR and sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing ( WGS) was performed on five representative isolates. The isolates were genotyped by PFGE. Forty-eight isolates positive for OXA-48 , collected from seven hospital centres in Croatia from May 2016 to May 2017 , were analysed ( 40 Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , 5 Enterobacter<pathogen> cloacae<pathogen> , 2 Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and one Citrobacter<pathogen> freundii<pathogen> Thirty-three isolates were ESBL positive and harboured group 1 CTX-M 1 β-lactamases. In addition to the β-lactam resistance genes detected by PCR ( blaSHV-1 , blaOXA-48 and blaOXA-1) , WGS of five representative isolates revealed the presence of genes encoding aminoglycoside resistance , aadA2 and aph3-Ia , fluoroquinolone resistance determinants aac ( 6) Ib-c , oqxA and oqxB , the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 , and fosA ( fosfomycin resistance). IncL plasmid was found in all isolates. Two K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> isolates belonged to ST16 , two E.<pathogen> cloacae<pathogen> to ST66 and E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> to ST354. K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> isolates were allocated to five clusters by PFGE which occured in different hospitals , indicating epidemic spread. The OXA-48-positive organisms found in this study showed wide variability in antibiotic susceptibility , β-lactamase content and PFGE banding patterns. This study revealed a switch from the predominance of VIM-1 in 2012-2013 to that of OXA-48 in the 2015 to 2017.
