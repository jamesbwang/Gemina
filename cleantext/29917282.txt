  Growing use of in vitro fertilization ( IVF) has resulted in an elevated twin birth rate , and a burgeoning population of IVF twins who are now aging into adolescence and beyond. This study tests a model examining whether parental conformity expectations have differential effects on twins ' versus singletons ' parent-adolescent relationship satisfaction , and if this effect is indirectly associated with relative changes in twins ' and singletons ' internalizing and externalizing behavior from middle childhood to adolescence. Using a sample of 278 IVF twins and singletons , path models demonstrate that twin status and conformity expectations interact to influence parent-adolescent relationships. Although there was an association between twin status and mother-adolescent relationship satisfaction among parents with high conformity expectations ( r = .25 , p < .01) , this relationship was nonsignificant among parents with low conformity expectations ( r = .05 , p = .85). The differential effect of conformity expectations on parent-adolescent relationship satisfaction for twins and singletons was indirectly associated with relative changes in twins ' and singletons ' externalizing behavior from middle childhood to adolescence. Results demonstrate that higher levels of parental conformity expectations may not have the same effect on adolescent twins and singletons.
