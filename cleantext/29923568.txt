  G3-G9 dendritic polyelectrolytes accompanied by counterions are investigated using the Poisson-Boltzmann-Flory theory. Within this approach we solve numerically the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the mean electrostatic potential and minimize the Poisson-Boltzmann-Flory free energy with respect to the size of the molecules. Such a scheme enables us to inspect the conformational and electrostatic properties of the dendrimers in equilibrium based on their response to varying the dendrimer generation. The calculations indicate that the G3-G6 dendrimers exist in the polyelectrolyte regime where absorption of counterions into the volume of the molecules is minor. Trapping of ions in the interior region becomes significant for the G7-G9 dendrimers and signals the emergence of the osmotic regime. We find that the behavior of the dendritic polyelectrolytes corresponds with the degree of ion trapping. In particular , in both regimes the polyelectrolytes are swollen as compared to their neutral counterparts and the expansion factor is maximal at the crossover generation G7.
