  Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM) is an important part of the treatment of primary liver cancer ( PLC) in China; however , the current instructions for the integrative use of traditional Chinese and Western medicine for PLC are mostly based on expert opinion. There is no evidence-based guideline for clinical practice in this field. Therefore , the Shanghai Association of Chinese Integrative Medicine has established a multidisciplinary working group to develop this guideline , which focuses on the most important questions about the use of TCM during PLC treatment. This guideline was developed following the methodological process recommended by the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Two rounds of questionnaire survey were performed to identify clinical questions; published evidence was searched; the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation approach was used to evaluate the body of evidence; and recommendations were formulated by combining the quality of evidence , patient preferences and values , and other risk factors. The guideline was written based on the Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare tool. This guideline contains 10 recommendations related to 8 questions , including recommendations for early treatment by TCM after surgery , TCM combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for advanced PLC , TCM drugs for external use , and acupuncture and moxibustion therapy.
