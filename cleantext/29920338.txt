  This study compares the pathological outcomes and operative morbidity for papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC) patients undergoing a primary total thyroidectomy ( TT) with central lymph node dissection ( CLND) , to those undergoing an interval CLND following a previous thyroid operation , or for the unsuspected diagnosis of PTC. Single-institution , retrospective review of PTC patients from 2000 to 2015 was performed. Three treatment groups were identified: primary TT/CLND , interval prophylactic CLND , and interval therapeutic CLND. Primary outcome measures were number of lymph nodes removed , hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN) injury. Results for 30 prophylactic and 35 therapeutic interval CLND were compared with 218 patients undergoing primary TT/CLND. Interval CLND was associated with similar rates of cervical metastases , complications , and a trend towards decreased lymph node recovery. Reoperative CLND for incidental PTC frequently identifies cervical lymph node metastases , potentially reduces recurrence , and can be performed with similar morbidity to a primary lymphadenectomy.
