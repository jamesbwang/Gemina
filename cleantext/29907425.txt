  Steroids exert a profound influence on behavioral reactivity , by modulating the functions of most neurotransmitters and shaping the impact of stress and sex-related variables on neural processes. This background- as well as the observation that most neuroactive steroids ( including sex hormones , glucocorticoids and neurosteroids) are synthetized and metabolized by overlapping enzymatic machineries- points to steroidogenic pathways as a powerful source of targets for neuropsychiatric disorders. Inhibitors of steroidogenic enzymes have been developed and approved for a broad range of genitourinary and endocrine dysfunctions , opening to new opportunities to repurpose these drugs for the treatment of mental problems. In line with this idea , preliminary clinical and preclinical results from our group have shown that inhibitors of key steroidogenic enzymes , such as 5Î±-reductase and 17,20 desmolase-lyase , may have therapeutic efficacy in specific behavioral disorders associated with dopaminergic hyperfunction. While the lack of specificity of these effects raises potential concerns about endocrine adverse events , these initial findings suggest that steroidogenesis modulators with greater brain specificity may hold significant potential for the development of alternative therapies for psychiatric problems.
