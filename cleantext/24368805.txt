  Polarised mRNA transport is a prevalent mechanism for spatial control of protein synthesis. However , the composition of transported ribonucleoprotein particles ( RNPs) and the regulation of their movement are poorly understood. We have reconstituted microtubule minus end-directed transport of mRNAs using purified components. A Bicaudal-D ( BicD) adaptor protein and the RNA-binding protein Egalitarian ( Egl) are sufficient for long-distance mRNA transport by the dynein motor and its accessory complex dynactin , thus defining a minimal transport-competent RNP. Unexpectedly , the RNA is required for robust activation of dynein motility. We show that a
