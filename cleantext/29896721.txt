  To determine the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> type 31 ( SCA31) related mutations among patients from mainland China. For a cohort of molecularly unassigned patients comprised of 295 SCA patients ( including 98 probands from families featuring autosomal dominant SCA and 197 sporadic cases) and 81 patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia<symptom> ( HSP) ( including 23 probands from families with autosomal dominant HSP and 58 sporadic cases) , TGGAA pentanucleotide expansion insertional mutation of the BEAN/TK2 gene was detected using repeat-primed PCR followed by capillary gel electrophoresis. No TGGAA pentanucleotide insertion expansion in BEAN/TK2 gene was identified in the above cohort. SCA31 is an extremely rare subtype of SCA and should not be included in routine genetic screening in mainland China.
