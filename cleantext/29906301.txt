  Flowering time is an important factor affecting grain yield in wheat. In this study , we divided reproductive spike development into eight sub-phases. These sub-phases have the potential to be delicately manipulated to increase grain yield. We measured 36 traits with regard to sub-phase durations , determined three grain yield-related traits in eight field environments and mapped 15 696 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP , based on 90k Infinium chip and 35k Affymetrix chip) markers in 210 wheat genotypes. Phenotypic and genetic associations between grain yield traits and sub-phase durations showed significant consistency ( Mantel test; r = 0.5377 , P < 0.001). The shared quantitative trait loci ( QTLs) revealed by the genome-wide association study suggested a close association between grain yield and sub-phase duration , which may be attributed to effects on spikelet initiation/spikelet number ( double ridge to terminal spikelet stage , DR-TS) and assimilate accumulation ( green anther to anthesis stage , GA-AN). Moreover , we observed that the photoperiod-sensitivity allele at the Ppd-D1 locus on chromosome 2D markedly extended all sub-phase durations , which may contribute to its positive effects on grain yield traits. The dwarfing allele at the Rht-D1 ( chromosome 4D) locus altered the sub-phase duration and displayed positive effects on grain yield traits. Data for 30 selected genotypes ( from among the original 210 genotypes) in the field displayed a close association with that from the greenhouse. Most importantly , this study demonstrated specific connections to grain yield in narrower time windows ( i.e. the eight sub-phases) , rather than the entire stem elongation phase as a whole.
