  In this Letter , analysis of steady-state regulatory T ( Treg) cell percentages from Il2ra enhancer deletion ( EDEL) and wild-type ( WT) mice revealed no differences between them ( Extended Data Fig. 9d). This analysis included two mice whose genotypes were incorrectly assigned. Even after correction of the genotypes , no significant differences in Treg cell percentages were seen when data across experimental cohorts were averaged ( as was done in Extended Data Fig. 9d). However , if we normalize the corrected data to account for variation among experimental cohorts , a subtle decrease in EDEL Treg cell percentages is revealed and , using the corrected and normalized data , we have redrawn Extended Data Fig. 9d in Supplementary Fig. 1. The Supplementary Information to this Amendment contains the corrected and reanalysed Extended Data Fig. 9d. The sentence `` This enhancer deletion ( EDEL) strain also had no obvious T cell phenotypes at steady state ( Extended Data Fig. 9). '' should read: `` This enhancer deletion ( EDEL) strain had a small decrease in the percentage of Treg cells ( Extended Data Fig. 9). ''. This error does not affect any of the main figures in the Letter or the data from mice with the human autoimmune-associated single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) knocked in or with a 12-base-pair deletion at the site ( 12DEL). In addition , we stated in the Methods that we observed consistent immunophenotypes of EDEL mice across three founders , but in fact , we observed consistent phenotypes in mice from two founders. This does not change any of our conclusions and the original Letter has not been corrected.
