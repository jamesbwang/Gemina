  Macrocyclic peptides are privileged scaffolds for drug development and constitute a significant portion of macrocyclic drugs on the market today in fields spanning from infectious<disease> disease<disease> to oncology. Developing orally bioavailable peptide-based drugs remains a challenging task; however , macrocyclization of linear peptides can be an effective strategy to improve membrane permeability , proteolytic stability , oral bioavailability , and overall drug-like characteristics for this class. Significant advances in solid-phase peptide synthesis ( SPPS) have enabled the efficient construction of macrocyclic peptide and peptidomimetic libraries with macrolactamization being performed on-resin or in solution phase. The primary goal of this review is to summarize solid-phase cyclohexapeptide synthesis using the on-resin and solution-phase macrocyclization methodologies published since 2013. We also highlight their broad applications ranging from natural product total synthesis , synthetic methodology development , and medicinal chemistry , to drug development and analyses of conformational and physiochemical properties.
