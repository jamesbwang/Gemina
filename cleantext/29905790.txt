  New microfat preparations provide material suitable for use as a regenerative filler for different facial areas. To support the development of new robust techniques for regenerative purposes , the cellular content of the sample should be considered. To evaluate the stromal vascular fraction ( SVF) cell components of micro-superficial enhanced fluid fat injection ( SEFFI) samples via a technique to harvest re-injectable tissue with minimum manipulation. The results were compared to those obtained from SEFFI samples. Microscopy analysis was performed to visualize the tissue structure. Micro-SEFFI samples were also fractionated using Celector ® , an innovative non-invasive separation technique , to provide an initial evaluation of sample fluidity and composition. SVFs obtained from SEFFI and micro-SEFFI were studied. Adipose stromal cells ( ASCs) were isolated and characterized by proliferation and differentiation capacity assays. Microscopic and quality analyses of micro-SEFFI samples by Celector ® confirmed the high fluidity and sample cellular composition in terms of red blood cell contamination , the presence of cell aggregates and extracellular matrix fragments. ASCs were isolated from adipose tissue harvested using SEFFI and micro-SEFFI systems. These cells were demonstrated to have a good proliferation rate and differentiation potential towards mesenchymal lineages. Despite the small sizes and low cellularity observed in micro-SEFFI-derived tissue , we were able to isolate stem cells. This result partially explains the regenerative potential of autologous micro-SEFFI tissue grafts. In addition , using this novel Celector ® technology , tissues used for aging treatment were characterized analytically , and the adipose tissue composition was evaluated with no need for extra sample processing.
