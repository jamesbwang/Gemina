  Increasingly affordable high-throughput molecular profiling technologies have made feasible the measurement of omics-wide interindividual variations for the purposes of predicting cancer prognosis. While multiple types of genetic , epigenetic and expression changes have been implicated in ovarian cancer , existing prognostic biomarker strategies are constrained to analyzing a single class of molecular variations. The extra predictive power afforded by the integration of multiple omics types remains largely unexplored. In this study , we performed integrative analysis on tumor-based exome- , transcriptome- and methylome-wide molecular profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) for variations in cancer-relevant genes to construct robust , cross-validated multiomic predictors for ovarian cancer survival. These integrated polygenic survival scores ( PSSs) were able to predict 5-year overall ( OS) and progression-free survival in the Caucasian subsample with high accuracy ( AUROC = 0.87 and 0.81 , respectively). These findings suggest that the PSSs are able to predict long-term OS in TCGA patients with accuracy beyond that of previously proposed protein-based biomarker strategies. Our findings reveal the promise of an integrated omics-based approach in enhancing existing prognostic strategies. Future investigations should be aimed toward prospective external validation , strategies for standardizing application and the integration of germline variants.
