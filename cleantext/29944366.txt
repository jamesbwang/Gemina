  Creating novel pesticides with phloem mobility is essential for controlling insects in vascular tissue and root , and conjugating existing pesticides with amino acid is an effective approach. In order to obtain a highly phloem-mobile candidate for efficient pesticides , an electro-neutral l-glutamine-fipronil conjugate ( l-GlnF) retaining Î±-amino acid function was designed and synthesized to fit the substrate specificity of an amino acid transporter. Cotyledon uptake and phloem loading tests with Ricinus<pathogen> communis<pathogen> have verified that l-GlnF was phloem mobile , and its phloem mobility was higher than that of its enantiomer d-GlnF and other previously reported amino acid-fipronil conjugates. Inhibition experiments then suggested that the uptake of l-GlnF was , at least partially , mediated by an active transport mechanism. This inference was further strengthened by assimilation experiments with Xenopus oocytes and genetically modified Arabidopsis thaliana , which showed a direct correlation between the uptake of l-GlnF and the expression of amino acid transporter AtLHT1. Thus , conjugation with l-Gln appears to be a potential strategy to ensure the uptake of pesticides via an endogenous amino acid transport system.
