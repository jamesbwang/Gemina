  Human tissue kallikrein 15 ( KLK15) is the last cloned member of the KLK-related gene family. Despite being implicated in multiple cancers , its pathophysiological role remains unknown. We aimed to biochemically characterize KLK15 and preliminarily study its role in cancer. Recombinant KLK15 protein was produced , purified to homogeneity and quantified by mass spectrometry ( parallel reaction monitoring analysis). We profiled the enzymatic activity of KLK15 using fluorogenic peptide substrates , and performed kinetic analysis to discover the cleavage sites. As KLK15 has mainly been associated with prostate cancer , we used a degradomic approach and subsequent KEGG pathway analysis to identify a number of putative protein substrates in the KLK15-treated prostate cancer cell line PC3. We discovered trypsin-like activity in KLK15 , finding that it cleaves preferentially after arginine ( R). The enzymatic activity of KLK15 was regulated by different factors such as pH , cations and serine protease inhibitors. Notably , we revealed that KLK15 most likely interacts with the extracellular matrix ( ECM) receptor group. To our knowledge , this is the first study that experimentally verifies the trypsin-like activity of KLK15. We show here for the first time that KLK15 may be able to cleave many ECM components , similar to several members of the KLK family. Thus the protease could potentially be linked to tumorigenesis by promoting metastasis via this mechanism.
