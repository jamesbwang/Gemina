  The most suitable treatment regimen for autoimmune hepatitis<disease> ( AIH) in adults remains unknown and requires further investigation. The current study therefore aimed to integrate evidence to provide hierarchies of the comparative efficacies of treatments measured by clinical and biochemical remission. A Bayesian-framework network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) was preformed to compare eight treatments for AIH. Eligible RCTs were identified by searching Embase , Pubmed and the Cochrane Library for publications between 1966 and April 2017. All outcomes were independently extracted from the included studies by two authors. A total of six RCTs were subsequently included in the current study. The network of comparisons on remission indicated that patients treated with prednisone ( pred) experienced significantly increased rates of remission compared with those treated with azathioprine ( AZA; odds ratio ( OR) , 0.21; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.06-0.71) and budesonide ( bude) + AZA significantly increased remission compared with placebo treatment ( OR , 36.66; 95 % CI , 1.40-962.49) or AZA ( OR , 10.30; 95 % CI , 1.50-70.70). Based on the cumulative ranking probabilities , bude + AZA ( 89.4) was ranked first , pred ( 69.1) was ranked second , pred + AZA ( 63.2) was ranked third and placebo ( 7.8) treatment was ranked last. Bude + AZA may be the most appropriate candidate for the treatment of non-cirrhotic patients. However , bude + AZA as frontline therapy for AIH requires more large-scale studies with a longer duration of follow-up histology and a focus on dose-response. Additionally , development of other prospective treatments , which may be used as alternative therapy or first line therapy , and their subsequent evaluation in clinical RCTs is required.
