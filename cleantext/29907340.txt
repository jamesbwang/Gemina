  The aldolase family members involved in metabolism and glycolysis are present in three isoforms: ALDOA , ALDOB , and ALDOC. Aldolases are differentially expressed in human tissues , and aberrant expression has been observed in several human<disease> diseases<disease> and cancer types. However , non-enzymatic functions through protein-protein interactions or epigenetic modifications have been reported in recent years. Using high-throughput screening and- omics database integration , aldolase has been validated as an independent clinical prognostic marker of human cancers. Therefore , the aim of this review was to provide potential clinical value from in silico predictions and also summarize well-known signaling axes or phenotypes in various cancer types. Finally , we discuss the role of aldolase in the treatment of human<disease> diseases<disease> and cancers.
