U.S. Army Physical Demands Study: Differences in physical fitness and occupational task performance between trainees and active duty soldiers. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-U.S. Army initial entry training ( IET) is designed to prepare trainees for the military environment and subsequent training , including specific programs to increase physical fitness to perform job-specific tasks to the minimal acceptable performance standard ( MAPS). The aim of this study was to compare physical fitness and occupational task performance of trainees at the end of IET to that of active duty soldiers. One hundred seventy-nine male combat arms trainees at the end of IET and 337 male combat arms active duty soldiers performed a sandbag carry ( SBC) , casualty drag ( CD) , and move under direct fire ( MUF). Physical fitness was assessed using Army Physical Fitness Test scores. A questionnaire was administered to determine frequency of task performance. Active duty soldiers compared with trainees were older ( p < 0.01) and performed more push-ups ( p < 0.01) and sit-ups ( p < 0.01). Trainees performed the 2-mile run faster ( p < 0.01). Ninety-four percent of trainees and 99 % of active duty soldiers performed the 3 tasks to the MAPSs. Active duty soldiers performed significantly faster on both the SBC ( p < 0.01) and CD ( p < 0.01) and reported a higher task frequency on the SBC ( p = 0.03) and CD ( p < 0.01). No difference in MUF performance ( p = 0.16) and task frequency ( p = 0.13) was detected. Initial entry training seems to provide sufficient physical training as most trainees were able to meet the MAPSs; however , performance differences were still apparent between trainees and active duty soldiers. Additional practice performing the physically demanding tasks may help maximize performance on the physically demanding job requirements.
