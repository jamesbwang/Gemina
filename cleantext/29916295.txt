  The accumulation of undegraded molecular material leads to progressive neurodegeneration in a number of lysosomal storage disorders ( LSDs) that are caused by functional deficiencies of lysosomal hydrolases. To determine whether inducing macroautophagy/autophagy via small-molecule therapy would be effective for neuropathic LSDs due to enzyme deficiency , we treated a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB<pathogen> ( MPS IIIB<pathogen>) , a storage disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme NAGLU ( alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase ( Sanfilippo disease IIIB<pathogen>)) , with the autophagy-inducing compound trehalose. Treated naglu ANOVA: analysis of variance; Atg7: autophagy related 7; AV: autophagic vacuoles; CD68: cd68 antigen; ERG: electroretinogram; ERT: enzyme replacement therapy; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; GNAT2: guanine nucleotide binding protein , alpha transducing 2; HSCT: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; INL: inner nuclear layer; LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha; MPS: mucopolysaccharidoses; NAGLU: alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase ( Sanfilippo disease IIIB<pathogen>); ONL: outer nuclear layer; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PRKCA/PKCÎ±: protein kinase C , alpha; S1BF: somatosensory cortex; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TFEB: transcription factor EB; VMP/VPL: ventral posterior nuclei of the thalamus.
