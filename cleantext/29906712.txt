  Expert writing involves the interaction among three cognitively demanding processes: planning , translating , and revising. To manage the cognitive load brought on by these processes , writers frequently use strategies. Here , we examined the effects of planning strategies on writing dynamics and final texts. Before writing an argumentative text with the triple-task technique , 63 undergraduates were asked either to elaborate an outline with the argumentative structure embedded ( structure-based planning condition) , to provide a written list of ideas for the text ( list-based planning condition) , or to do a non-writing-related filler task ( no planning condition). Planning showed no effects on the length of the pre-writing pause and cognitive effort , but influenced writing processes occurrences. Compared to participants in the no-planning condition , those in the planning conditions showed a later activation of revising. Moreover , participants in the structure-based condition were mainly focused on translating in the beginning and middle of composition , whereas their peers tended to distribute their attention among all processes. Planning ahead of writing also resulted in texts with longer words , produced at a higher rate. Only the structure-based planning strategy led to an increase in the number of argumentation elements as well as in essays ' persuasiveness and overall quality. There was , however , no indication that these improvements in final texts were associated with changes in the dynamics of writing. Overall , the use of structure-based plans seems to be an effective and efficient way of improving undergraduates ' argumentative writing.
