  Exacerbations of COPD ( ECOPD) are important events in the course of COPD and they accelerate the rate of decline of lung function , and exacerbations requiring hospitalization are associated with significant mortality. Therefore , developing approaches of prevention and early treatment of ECOPDs are of special clinical interests. One of such approaches is telecare , including home telemonitoring. Daily telemonitoring of HR , BP , SpO Nineteen patients were included to the study. We observed significant decrease in SpO Oxygen saturation telemonitoring would be successfully used in predicting ECOPD. Recording of day-to-day decrease in oxygen saturation > 4 % as alarming events would be effective approach which would be easily implemented in telemonitoring devices , however this outcome should be further validated in larger size samples.
