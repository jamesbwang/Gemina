  Richman , ED , Tyo , BM , and Nicks , CR. Combined effects of self-myofascial release and dynamic stretching on range of motion , jump , sprint , and agility performance. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Massage has been used as both a pre- and post-exercise modality with purported benefits to flexibility and athletic performance. This study was designed to determine the effect of a 6-minute protocol of self massage known as self-myofascial release ( SMR) using a foam rolling device in conjunction with a general warm-up and sport-specific dynamic stretching ( DS) session on flexibility and explosive athletic performance in a sample of 14 female collegiate athletes. After familiarization , participants completed 2 testing sessions that began with 5 minutes of jogging at a self-selected pace , followed by either a 6-minute foam rolling session ( SMR) or 6 minutes of light walking ( LW) and a subsequent 6-minute period of sport-specific DS. Sit-and-reach ( SR) was measured after a general warm-up , the SMR , or LW session , and following DS , after which participants performed 3 trials each of squat jump ( SJ) , countermovement jump ( CMJ) , and drop jump ( DJ). Two additional tests , the agility T-Test ( TT) and a 10-yd short sprint ( SP) , were then performed. The change in SR after SMR was significantly greater than the change seen in SR after LW , although the total changes seen in each condition were not statistically different after the addition of DS. Squat jump and CMJ improved by 1.72 ± 2.47 cm and 2.63 ± 3.74 cm ( p = 0.070 , p = 0.070) , with no significant change to DJ , SP , and TT. Self-myofascial release in the form of foam rolling after a general warm-up and preceding a DS session seems to improve SJ and CMJ with no detriment to flexibility , DJ , sprint , and agility performance in comparison with LW and DS.
