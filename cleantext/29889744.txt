  To estimate the incidence of pulmonary aspiration and other anesthesia-related adverse events in women undergoing dilation and evacuation ( D&E) under intravenous deep sedation without tracheal intubation in an outpatient setting. We reviewed all D&E s done under anesthesiologist-administered intravenous deep sedation without tracheal intubation between February 2009 and April 2013. The study 's primary outcome was pulmonary aspiration; secondary outcomes included other anesthesia-related complications. We calculated the incidence of anesthesia-related adverse events as well as a 95 % CI around the point estimate. During the 51-month study period , 4,481 second-trimester abortions<disease> were completed. Of these , 2,523 ( 56 %) were done under deep sedation without tracheal intubation , 652 ( 26 %) between 14 and 19Â 6/7 weeks of gestation , and 1,871 ( 74 %) between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation. Seven cases of anesthesia-related complications were identified: two cases of pulmonary aspiration ( 0.08 % , 95 % CI 0.01-0.29 %) , four cases of upper airway obstruction ( 0.016 % , 95 % CI 0.04-0.41 %) , and one case of lingual nerve injury ( 0.04 % , 95 % CI 0.001-0.22 %). Deep sedation without tracheal intubation for women undergoing D&E has a low incidence of anesthesia-related complications.
