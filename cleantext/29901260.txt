  KaiC protein is the pivotal component of the circadian clock in cyanobacteria. While KaiC family proteins are well conserved throughout divergent phylogenetic lineages , studies of the physiological roles of KaiC proteins from other microorganisms have been limited. We examined the role of the KaiC proteins , KaiC1 and KaiC2 , in the methanol-utilizing bacterium<pathogen> Methylobacterium<pathogen> extorquens AM1. Wild-type M.<pathogen> extorquens<pathogen> AM1 cells exhibited temperature-dependent UV resistance ( TDR) under permissive growth temperatures ( 24-32 Â°C). Both the phosphorylation of KaiC2 and the intracellular levels of KaiC1 were temperature-dependent , and the TDR phenotype was positively regulated by KaiC1 and negatively regulated by KaiC2. Taken together with biochemical and functional analogies to the KaiC protein of cyanobacteria , our present results suggest that KaiC family proteins function to integrate environmental cues , i.e , temperature and UV light , and output appropriate cellular responses to allow cells to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
