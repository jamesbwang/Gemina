  Autologous fat grafting ( AFG) is increasing in popularity to address a variety of defects. There is interest in developing techniques to harvest , process and inject fat to improve clinical outcomes as well as operative efficiency. The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the rate of graft processing of two commercially available systems for graft preparation. Twenty consecutive cases using an active filtration system-AF were observed followed by twenty consecutive cases using a passive filtration system-PF to compare efficiency rate. Fat processing rate was quantified in milliliters/minute. Forty patients underwent autologous fat grafting with no differences in patient characteristics between the groups. There was one incidence of palpable fat necrosis<symptom> per group ( 5 %). For all patients , this was the first fat grafting procedure; 20 % of patients ( n = 4 per group) had additional fat grafting. Overall , the rate of adipose tissue preparation was significantly higher with the active system-AF compared to the passive system-PF ( 19.8 ml/min vs 5.3 ml/min , p â‰¤ 0.001). The resulting percent of graftable fat was comparable ( AF: 41 % vs. PF: 42 %; p = 0.83). Time and motion studies such as this provide a means to systematically document each of the steps involved in fat grafting in a reliable fashion. The authors demonstrate significantly higher rate of lipoaspirate processing using an active filtration system compared to a passive system. Further large-scale studies of the efficacy and cost analysis of autologous fat grafting are a necessary component of determining best practices in the field.
