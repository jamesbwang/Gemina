  Relationships between health professionals and pharmaceutical manufacturers can unduly influence clinical practice. These relationships are the focus of global transparency efforts , including in Europe. We conducted a descriptive content analysis of the transparency provisions implemented by February 2017 in nine European Union ( EU) countries concerning payments to health professionals , with duplicate independent coding of all data. Using an author-generated , semi-structured questionnaire , we collected information from each disclosure policy/code on: target industries , categories of healthcare professionals covered , scope of payments included , location and searchability of the disclosed data. Our analysis shows that although important improvements have been put in place in the past few years , significant gaps remain in disclosure requirements and their implementation. The situation differs substantially from country to country and the most striking differences are between governmental and self-regulatory approaches , especially with regard to the comprehensiveness of the disclosed data. In many cases , individuals can still opt out and reporting is incomplete , with common influential gifts such as food and drink excluded. Finally , in several countries data are only available as separate PDFs from companies , thus making the payment reports difficult to access and analyse. In order to overcome these gaps , minimum standards for disclosures should be implemented across Europe. All payments to healthcare professionals and organizations should be included , all health-related industries should be required to submit reports , and usability of disclosed data should be guaranteed.
