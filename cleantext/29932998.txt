  Olive oil-entrapped diethanolamine-modified high-methoxyl pectin ( DMP)- gellan gum ( GG)- bionanofiller composites were developed for controlled intragastric delivery of metformin HCl ( MFM). DMP had a degree of amidation of 48.7 % and was characterized further by FTIR , XRD and DSC analyses. MFM-loaded composites were subsequently accomplished by green synthesis via ionotropic gelation technique using zinc acetate as cross-linker. The thermal , X-ray and infrared analyses suggested an environment in the composites compatible with the drug , except certain degree of attenuation in drug 's crystallinity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed almost spherical shape of the composites. Depending upon the mass ratios of GG: DMP , types of nanofiller ( neusilin/bentonite/Florite) and oil inclusion , the composites exhibited variable drug encapsulation efficiency ( DEE , 50-85 %) and extended drug release behaviours ( Q
