  To investigate the efficacy and safety of thalidomide in patients with thalassemia intermedia<pathogen> ( TI). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of TI who met the trial criteria and signed consent forms were prescribed oral thalidomide 50 mg qn for 3 months from February 2017. Complete blood counts , Hb analysis , and liver and kidney functions were monitored monthly during treatment and any differences were compared before and after treatment. Patients with Hb increments > 2.0 g/dL were termed main responders ( MaR) , and those with Hb increments between 1.0 and 2.0 g/dL as minor responders ( MiR) , otherwise they were termed non-responders. Relevance analysis was performed to explore parameters predicting Hb increments after treatment. Adverse effects during treatment were carefully recorded. The overall response rate ( ORR = MaR + MiR) and MaR rates were 78.6 and 50 % after 1 month of treatment , respectively , and 85.7 and 71.4 % after 3 months treatment. At the end of the treatment period , Hb and HbF increased by 2.5 ± 1.8 g/dL and 2.5 ± 1.6 g/dL , while bilirubin , lactate dehydrogenase , and the nucleated red blood cell count ( NRBC) were significantly decreased , while the reticulocyte count significantly increased. Correlation analysis showed that the Hb increments correlated significantly with the ratio of HbF before treatment ( r = 0.683 , P = 0.007) rather than age , Hb , reticulocyte count , and NRBC before treatment. Adverse events during treatment were mild , and drug reduction or withdrawal from the trial was not required. Thalidomide had rapid and significant effects in patients with TI , and also , it is safe and convenient. But larger scale clinical trials will be required to confirm our conclusions.
