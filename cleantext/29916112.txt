  Treatment for disorders of consciousness<symptom> ( DOCs) is still a Gordian knot. Evidence-based guidelines on the treatment of DOC patients are not currently available , while neuromodulation techniques are seen as a potential treatment. Multiple neuromodulation therapies have been applied. This article reviews the most relevant studies in the literature in order to describe a clear picture of the current state of neuromodulation therapies that could be used to treat DOC patients. Both invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation is discussed. Significant behavioral improvements in prolonged DOCs under neuromodulation therapies are rare. The efficacy of various such therapies remains a matter of debate. Further clinical investigations of existing techniques in larger samples properly controlling for spontaneous recovery are needed , and new approaches are awaited.
