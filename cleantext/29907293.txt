  Cancer stem cells ( CSCs) are responsible for maintaining tumor growth , metastasis and recurrence. The high expression of cancer stem cell transcription factors ( Oct4 , Sox2 and Nanog) is a valuable prognostic factor , suggesting a higher risk of tumor recurrence and metastasis. So , the development of a convenient and cost-effective method for multiplex assay of these transcription factors ( TFs) is highly required. In this work , we have proposed a universal homogeneous assay for multicolor detection of these TFs based on anti-dsDNA antibody-decorated Fe
