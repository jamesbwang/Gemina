  The goals of this study were to assess the impact of work at the World Trade Center ( WTC) site in relation to new , post-9 / 11/2001 ( 9/11) antibody to hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> Virus<pathogen> ( anti-HCV); and , evaluate secular trends in WTC-exposed male Fire Department of New<pathogen> York City ( FDNY) Firefighters and Emergency Medical Services ( EMS) responders. FDNY monitors responder health through physical exams and routine blood work. We used descriptive statistics to compare trans-9/ 11 and post-9/ 11 incidence and to assess trends in prevalence from 2000 to 2012. Trans-9/ 11 incidence of new anti-HCV was 0.42 per 100 persons compared with post-9/ 11 incidence of 0.34 ( P = 0.68). Overall seroprevalence was 1.3 %; rates declined from 1.79 per 100 to 0.49 per 100 over time ( P < 0.0001). Work at the WTC was not associated with new infection. Biennial seroprevalence in responders declined over time , supporting the FDNY decision to discontinue routine annual testing in this cohort.
