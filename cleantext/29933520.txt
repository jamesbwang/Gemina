  Calvatia species , generally known as puffball mushrooms , are used both as sources of food and as traditional medicine. Among the Calvatia genus , Calvatia nipponica ( Agaricaceae) is one of the rarest species. Using bioassay-guided fractionation based on anti-inflammatory effects , five alkaloids ( 1- 5) , two phenolics ( 6 and 7) , and a fatty acid methyl ester ( 8) were isolated from the fruiting bodies of C. nipponica. Compound 8 was identified from C. nipponica for the first time , and all isolates ( 1- 8) were tested for inhibition of nitric oxide ( NO) production in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- stimulated RAW264 .7 macrophages. Compound 7 showed mild inhibition while compound 8 significantly inhibited NO production with an IC
