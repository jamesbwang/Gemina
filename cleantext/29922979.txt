  In distal radius fracture repair , complications often lead to reoperation and increased cost. We examined the trends and complications in open reduction internal fixation of distal radius fractures across hand specialist and non-hand specialist surgeons. We examined claims data from the Humana administrative claims database between 2007 and 2016. International Classification of Disease , 9th Edition and Current Procedural Terminology codes were searched related to distal radius fractures repaired by open reduction internal fixation. Patients were filtered based on initial treatment by a hand specialty or non-hand specialty surgeon. Complications were reported within 1 year of surgical treatment in the following distinct categories: non-union , malunion , extensor/flexor tendon repair , CRPS , infection. Descriptive statistics were reported. Hand specialists accounted for 182 procedures compared with 7708 procedures by non-hand specialty orthopaedic or general surgeons. There was an increase in the total number of procedures performed by hand specialists across the years of study , with a higher percentage of intra-articular cases completed by hand specialists ( 80.7 %) compared to non-hand specialists ( 70.1 %). Overall , the complication rates of hand specialists ( 6.5 %) were higher than that of non-specialists ( 4.7 %). The results of this study demonstrate a small difference in overall complications for open reduction internal fixation of distal radius fractures by hand specialists in comparison to non-specialists despite treating a higher percentage of intra-articular fractures. Future work controlling for factors unaccounted for in claims-based analyses , such as fracture complexity , patient comorbidities , and surgeon factors are needed. Therapeutic IV.
