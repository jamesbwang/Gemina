  To compare different appliances for early anterior open bite ( AOB) correction. This was a parallel , randomized clinical trial. A prospective sample of patients with AOB was recruited consecutively. Eligibility criteria included angle class I malocclusion with AOB equal to or greater than 1 mm. Participants were allocated by simple randomization to 4 groups: bonded spurs , chin cup , fixed palatal crib , and removable palatal crib. Dentoalveolar changes among the groups were assessed by blinded observers by comparing lateral cephalograms taken before ( T1) and 12 months after treatment ( T2; analysis of variance followed by Tukey test). Of the measurements , 30 % were reassessed for reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman agreement test; α = 5 %; 95 % confidence interval). A total of 99 patients with a mean AOB of 3.7 mm ( mean age 8.4 ± 0.8 years , both genders) were recruited. Dropouts occurred in all the groups , yielding a final sample size of 81 analyzed individuals. Intergroup comparisons of differences ( T2-T1) showed significant differences for the incisor positioning variables ( 1.1 , 1-PP , 6-PP , IMPA , 1. NB and 1-GoMe). However , there was no significant difference in AOB reduction among the groups , with an average correction of 3.1 mm. All of the tested devices promoted dental changes , especially in the anterior region , and contributed to AOB reduction during the study period. However , fixed palatal crib demonstrated greater impact on the positioning of the incisors.
