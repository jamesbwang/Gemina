  Laparoscopic ileo-pouch-anal anastomosis ( IPAA) has been reported as having low morbidity and several advantages. To evaluate safety , efficacy and long-term results of laparoscopic IPAA , performed in elective or emergency settings , in consecutive unselected IBD patients. All the patients received totally laparoscopic 2-stage ( proctocolectomy and IPAA- stoma closure) or 3-stage ( colectomy- proctectomy and IPAA- stoma closure) procedure according to their presentation. From July 2007 to July 2016 , 160 patients entered the study. 50.6 % underwent a 3-stage procedure and 49.4 % a 2-stage procedure. Mortality and morbidity were 0.6 % and 24.6 %. Conversion rate was 3.75 %. 8.7 % septic complications were associated with steroids and Infliximab treatment ( p = 0.0001). 3-stage patients were younger ( p = 0.0001) , with shorter disease duration ( p = 0.0001) , minor ASA scores of 2 and 3 ( p = 0.0007) , lower inflammatory index and better nutritional status ( p = 0.003 and 0.0001) , fewer Clavien-Dindo 's grade II complications ( p = .0001) , reduced rates of readmission and reoperation at 90 days ( p = 0.03) , and shorter hospitalization ( p = .0001) , but with similar pouch and IPAA leakage , compared to 2-stage patients. 8 years pouch failure and definitive ileostomy were 5.1 % and 3.7 %. A totally laparoscopic approach is safe and feasible , with very low mortality and morbidity rates and very low conversion rate , even in multi-stage procedures and high-risk patients.
