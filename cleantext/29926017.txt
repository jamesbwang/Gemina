  Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy ( DOSY) is a powerful method for the analysis of mixtures. Classic DOSY methods require several minutes of acquisition , and we show here that DOSY experiments can be recorded in less than one second for the challenging case of solution mixtures in low-viscosity solvents. The proposed method relies on a spatial encoding of the diffusion dimension , for which convection-compensation and spectral-selection strategies are introduced. The method is illustrated with the analysis of a reaction mixture , and more accurate estimates of the diffusion coefficients are obtained.
