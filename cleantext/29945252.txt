  Cryptococcal meningitis<disease> ( CM) causes 10-20 % of HIV-related deaths in Africa. We performed a phase-II non-inferiority trial examining the Early Fungicidal Activity ( EFA) of three short-course , high-dose liposomal amphotericin B ( L-AmB) regimens for CM in Tanzania and Botswana. HIV-infected adults with CM were randomized to: ( i) L-AmB 10mg/kg day 1 ( single dose); ( ii) L-AmB 10mg/kg day 1 , 5mg/kg day 3 ( two doses); ( iii) L-AmB 10mg/kg day 1 , 5 mg/kg days 3 and 7 ( three doses); ( iv) standard 14-day L-AmB 3mg/kg/day ( control); all given with fluconazole 1200mg/day for 14 days. Primary endpoint was mean rate of clearance of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) cryptococal infection ( EFA). Non-inferiority was defined as an upper limit of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval ( CI) of difference in EFA between intervention and control less than 0.2 log10CFU/ml/day. 80 participants were enrolled. EFA for daily L-AmB was -0.41 ( standard deviation 0.11 , n = 17) log10CFU/mL/day. Difference in mean EFA from control was -0.11 ( 95 % CI -0.29,0.07) log10CFU/mL/day faster with single dose ( n = 16); -0.05 ( 95 % CI -0.20,0.10) log10CFU/mL/day faster with two doses ( n = 18); and -0.13 ( 95 % CI -0.35,0.09) log10CFU/mL/day faster with three doses ( n = 18). EFA in all short-course arms was non-inferior to control at the predefined non-inferiority margin. Overall 10-week mortality was 29 % ( n = 23) with no statistical difference between arms. All arms were well tolerated. Single dose 10mg/kg L-AmB was well tolerated and led to non-inferior EFA compared to 14 days of 3mg/kg/d L-AmB in HIV-associated CM. Induction based on single 10mg/kg L-AmB dose is being taken forward to a phase-III clinical endpoint trial.
