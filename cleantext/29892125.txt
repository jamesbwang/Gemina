  Effect of pulsed electric field ( PEF) strength , pulse duration and temperature used during PEF assisted blanching pretreatment on energy input , cell disintegration index and drying time of apple slices was studied. A central composite rotatable design was used for designing the experiment and to visualize the effect of variables on responses. The level of variables used in the design varied from 1 to 2 kV cm
