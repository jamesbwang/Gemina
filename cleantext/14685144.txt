  To measure the aqueous humor concentrations of inflammatory factors in patients with congenital cataract and to investigate the relationship between the levels and postoperative inflammatory responses. Aqueous humor samples were prospectively collected from 65 eyes of children with congenital cataracts from January to June 2015. The levels of 41 inflammation-related cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors in aqueous humor were measured using multiplex bead immunoassay. Data on patient demographics and postoperative inflammatory response evaluation of posterior capsule opacification ( EPCO) scores were collected for correlation analysis of short- and long-term postoperative inflammatory responses , respectively. Fifteen inflammatory factors were differentially expressed between congenital cataract and age-related cataract. EGF and IL-3 were positively correlated , whereas IL-8 and MCP-1 were negatively correlated with age. TNFÎ± , IL-17A , IL-3 , and sCD40L were preferably expressed in specific morphological types of congenital cataract. One month and 3 months postoperatively , PDGF-AA exhibited a positive correlation with the EPCO scores , whereas IL-1RA exhibited a negative correlation. Macrophage-derived chemokine ( MDC) showed a positive correlation with the EPCO scores 1 year postoperatively. This study provided a comprehensive preoperative profile of inflammatory factors and their correlations with postoperative inflammatory responses in patients with congenital cataract. These factors may serve as potential biomarkers to predict the postoperative inflammatory response. These findings will also facilitate the development of anti-inflammatory medications in the perioperative period.
