  B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHLs) is a very heterogonous malignancy with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma ( FL) as the most common subtypes. Standard treatment with anti-CD20 based chemoimmunotherapy is usually very effective for disease control. However a significant proportion of patients with high-risk features ( double hit lymphoma , transformed lymphomas or early relapses) will become refractory to standard therapies and will have limited alternatives for cure. Adoptive therapy with chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T-cells is a new paradigm for effective treatment of poor prognosis lymphomas. Here we review the biology of poor risk DLBCL and FL , the rationale for CAR T-cell therapy in malignant lymphoma and the efficacy/toxicity profile of CD19 directed CAR T cell therapy for DLBCL and FL from early single center studies to multicenter/global clinical trial with different CAR T cell constructs.
