  Bacillus<pathogen> sp.. SJ-10 ( KCCM 90078 , JCM 15709) is a halotolerant bacterium<pathogen> isolated from a traditional Korean food , i.e. , salt-fermented fish ( jeotgal). The bacterium<pathogen> can survive and engage in metabolism at high salt concentrations. Here , we reported complete genome sequence of Bacillus<pathogen> sp.. SJ-10 , which has a single circular chromosome of 4,041,649 base pairs with a guanine-cytosine content of 46.39 %. Bacillus<pathogen> sp.. SJ-10 encodes a subunit of poly-γ-glutamic acid ( γ-PGA) with a molecular weight of approximately 400 kDa , which contains four γ-PGA synthases ( pgsB , pgsC , pgsAA and pgsE) and one γ-PGA-releasing gene ( pgsS). This bacterium<pathogen> also able to produce salt-stable enzymes such as protease , β-glucosidase , and β-1,3-1,4-glucanase. This affords significant insights into strategies employed by halotolerant bacteria to survive at high salt concentrations. The sequence contains information on secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene cluster , and most importantly enzymes produced by the bacterium<pathogen> may be valuable with respect to food , beverage , detergent , animal feed , and certain commercial contexts.
