  In this work , praseodymium ( iii) borohydride , Pr ( BH4) 3 , and an isotopically enriched analogue , Pr ( 11BD4) 3 , are prepared by a new route via a solvate complex , Pr ( 11BD4) 3S ( CH3) 2. Nd ( BH4) 3 was synthesized using the same method and the structures , polymorphic transformations , and thermal stabilities of these compounds are investigated in detail. α-Pr ( BH4) 3 and α-Nd ( BH4) 3 are isostructural with cubic unit cells ( Pa3 ( combining macron)) stable at room temperature ( RT) and a unit cell volume per formula unit ( V/Z) of 180.1 and 175.8 Å3 , respectively. Heating α-Pr ( BH4) 3 to T ∼ 190 °C , p ( Ar) = 1 bar , introduces a transition to a rhombohedral polymorph , r-Pr ( BH4) 3 ( R3 ( combining macron) c with a smaller unit cell volume and a denser structure , V/Z = 156.06 Å3. A similar transition was not observed for Nd ( BH4) 3. However , heat treatment of α-Pr ( BH4) 3 , at T ∼ 190 °C , p ( H2) = 40 bar and α-Nd ( BH4) 3 , at T ∼ 270 °C , p ( H2) = 98 bar facilitates reversible formation of another three cubic polymorph , denoted as β , β ' and β ''- RE ( BH4) 3 ( Fm3 ( combining macron) c Moreover , the transition β- to β '- to β ''- is considered a rare example of stepwise negative thermal expansion. For Pr ( BH4) 3 , ∼ 2/3 of the sample takes this route of transformation whereas in argon only ∼ 5 wt % , and the remaining transforms directly from α- to r-Pr ( BH4) 3. The β-polymorphs are porous with V/Z = 172.4 and 172.7 Å3 for β ''- RE ( BH4) 3 , RE = Pr or Nd , respectively , and are stabilized by the elevated hydrogen pressures. The polymorphic transitions occur due to rotation of RE ( BH4) 6 octahedra without breaking or forming chemical bonds. Structural DFT optimization reveals the decreasing stability of α-Pr ( BH4) 3 > β-Pr ( BH4) 3 > r-Pr ( BH4) 3.
