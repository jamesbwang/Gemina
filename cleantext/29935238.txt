  The genus Pomacea contains most of the economically important Ampullariid apple snails. Five Pomacea species were reported introduced out of their native ranges , including three highly invasive species , i.e. P. maculata , P. canaliculata and an unidentified species , Pomacea sp.. In this study , the mitogenome of P. maculata was determined , which carried typical gene set of metazoan mitogenomes and shared the same gene rearrangement of Ampullariidae mitogenomes. The control region of the P. maculata has a 13-bp inverted repeat unit. We compared the mitogenome of P. maculata with P. canaliculata , Pomacea sp. and the aquatic pet species , P. diffusa. The three highly invasive species showed high sequence similarity of PCGs and RNAs. atp8 and nad2 showed the lowest similarity and the highest Ka/Ks ratios , indicating that both genes have potential for studying species identification and populations genetics in apple snails. All PCGs have the Ka/Ks ratios < 1 , indicating the existence of purifying selection in Pomacea species. We reconstructed phylogenetic trees using 14 Caenogastropda species based on sequences of PCGs and rRNAs using Bayesian inference. Pomacea maculata grouped with other Ampullariids and was most closely related to Pomacea sp.. The mitogenome of P. maculata provides useful genetic resource for exploring the genetics and evolution of P. maculata and other apple snails.
