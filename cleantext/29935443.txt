  Currently , lacosamide ( LCM) is not approved for use in status epilepticus ( SE) but several shreds of evidence are available to support its use. The present study was , therefore , undertaken to evaluate the effect of LCM on pilocarpine ( PILO) induced SE and neurodegeneration in C57BL/6 mice and to ascertain the involvement of CRMP-2 in mediating above effect. Pilocarpine-induced SE model was developed to explore the effect of LCM 20 , 40 and 80 mg/kg in mice. We assessed the seizure<symptom> severity , seizure<symptom> latency , spontaneous alternation behavior ( SAB) and motor coordination by behavioral observation. Histopathological evaluation and measurement of the levels of CRMP-2 , reduced glutathione ( GSH) and malondialdehyde ( MDA) were carried out in mice hippocampus. LCM exhibited a biphasic effect i.e. , protection against SE at 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg dose whilst aggravated seizure-like behavior and mortality at 80 mg/kg. Further , it increased percentage alternation ( i.e. , restored spatial memory) in SAB and elevated motor impairment with increasing dose. Histologically , LCM 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg ( but not 80 mg/kg) reduced neurodegeneration. LCM 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg reversed the elevated MDA and GSH levels while 80 mg/kg showed a tendency to increase oxidative stress. In contrast , LCM ( at all doses) reversed the pilocarpine-induced elevation of collapsin response mediator protein-2 ( CRMP-2). LCM protected against pilocarpine-induced SE , associated neurodegeneration and improved pilocarpine-associated impairment of spatial memory. The study reveals that CRMP-2 may not be mediating the inverted-U-response of LCM at least in pilocarpine model. Therefore , the anti-oxidant effect of LCM ( and not its ability to modulate CRMP-2) was anticipated as the mechanism underlying neuroprotection.
