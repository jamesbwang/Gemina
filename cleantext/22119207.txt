  The transport of calcium and phosphorus is mainly relied on their corresponding transporters. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of dietary phosphorus level on the expression of the relevant calcium and phosphorus transporters in laying hens , which has a large amount of calcium and phosphorus input from intestine and output from kidney and eggshell gland. Thirty-six 25-week-old Hy-line Brown<disease> hens were fed diets with different available phosphorus level ( AP , 0.15 , 0.41 , and 0.82 %) , respectively. The expression of phosphorus transporters type IIa and type IIb Na/Pi co-transporter ( NPt2a , NPt2b) , calcium transporter calbindin-D28k ( CaBP-D28k) , and plasma membrane Ca ATPase 1b ( PMCA1b) were measured in small intestine , kidney , and eggshell gland by RT-PCR and western blot. The results showed that serum calcitriol and PTH concentrations were not affected (
