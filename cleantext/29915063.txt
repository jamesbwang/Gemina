  Found in 1968 , the archaeological site of Anzick , Montana , contains the only known Clovis burial. Here , the partial remains of a male infant , Anzick-1 , were found in association with a Clovis assemblage of over 100 lithic and osseous artifacts-all red-stained with ochre. The incomplete , unstained cranium of an unassociated , geologically younger individual , Anzick-2 , was also recovered. Previous chronometric work has shown an age difference between Anzick-1 and the Clovis assemblage ( represented by dates from two antler rod samples). This discrepancy has led to much speculation , with some discounting Anzick-1 as Clovis. To resolve this issue , we present the results of a comprehensive radiocarbon dating program that utilized different pretreatment methods on osseous material from the site. Through this comparative approach , we obtained a robust chronometric dataset that suggests that Anzick-1 is temporally coeval with the dated antler rods. This implies that the individual is indeed temporally associated with the Clovis assemblage.
