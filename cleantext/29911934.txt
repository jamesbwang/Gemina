  Collective narcissism-a phenomenon in which individuals show excessively high regard for their own group-is ubiquitous in studies of small groups. We examined how Americans from the 50 U.S. states ( N = 2,898) remembered U.S. history by asking them , `` In terms of percentage , what do you think was your home state 's contribution to the history of the United States? '' The mean state estimates ranged from 9 % ( Iowa) to 41 % ( Virginia) , with the total contribution for all states equaling 907 % , indicating strong collective narcissism. In comparison , ratings provided by nonresidents for states were much lower ( but still high). Surprisingly , asking people questions about U.S. history before they made their judgment did not lower estimates. We argue that this ethnocentric bias is due to ego protection , selective memory retrieval processes involving the availability heuristic , and poor statistical reasoning. This study shows that biases that influence individual remembering also influence collective remembering.
