  Binge drinking and continued alcohol use in large amounts are associated with many health problems but there are very few studies on the effects of alcohol intake on the function of lung , the effects of ethanol on lung diseases , and links between alcohol consumption and lung cancer. Therefore , our knowledge of these interactions from pathophysiological , clinical and epidemiological aspects is poor. Acute alcohol exposure stimulates the beating of the cilia of mucociliary epithelium cells but the effects of chronic ethanol over-exposure are different , with a progressive desensitization of ciliary response: ethanol exposure reduces airway mucociliary clearance. As a result this important innate primary defense mechanism , which protects the lungs from the deleterious effects of different pollutants , allergens and pathogens , is weakened. Chronic alcohol exposure alters the adaptative immune response to pathogens ( decreasing the phagocytic function of macrophages) and leads to an inflammatory response ( pro-inflammatory cytokines). Respiratory function is impaired by alcohol misuse: asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , lung<disease> infections<disease> , and the acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> are more frequent and severe. It is difficult to establish a causal link between alcohol and lung cancer as the lung cancer risk is likely confounded by the effect of smoking. Very few studies among never smokers have been conducted until now and the results are not consistent: they are therefore necessary to confirm or refute whether lung cancer is attributable to alcohol misuse. The pulmonary effects of alcohol misuse are many but further investigations into the mechanism by which alcohol might predispose to lung cancer are necessary.
