  Recently , fNIRS has been proposed as a promising approach for awareness detection , and a possible method to establish basic communication in patients with disorders of consciousness<symptom> ( DOC). Using fNIRS , the present study evaluated the applicability of auditory presented mental-arithmetic tasks in this respect. We investigated the applicability of active attention to serial subtractions for awareness detection in ten healthy controls ( HC , 21-32 y/o) , by comparing the measured patterns to patterns induced by self-performance of the same task. Furthermore , we examined the suitability of ignoring the given task as additional control signal to implement a two-class brain-computer interface ( BCI) paradigm. Finally , we compared our findings in HC with recordings in one DOC patient ( 78 y/o). Results of the HC revealed no differences between the self-performance and the attention condition , making the attention task suitable for awareness detection. However , there was no general difference between the ignore and attend condition , making the tasks less suitable for BCI control. Despite inconsistent correlations between the patient data and the HC group , single runs of the patient recordings revealed task-synchronous patterns- however , we can not conclude whether the measured activation derives from instruction based task performance and thus awareness.
