  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of surgery involving the use of folded trapezius flaps to repair large pharyngocutaneous fistulae<disease> ( PCFs) developing after salvage total laryngectomy. Folded extended vertical lower trapezius island<disease> myocutaneous flaps ( TIMFs) were created to repair large PCFs that developed after salvage total laryngectomy in eight patients. The maximum fistula<disease> dimension was 4.5 × 3.0 cm and the minimum was 2.0 × 1.8 cm. The skin paddle of the extended vertical TIMF ranged from 5 cm to 9 cm in width and 10 cm to 23 cm in length. The inner lining ranged from 3 cm × 3 cm to 6 cm × 6 cm in dimension and the outer lining from 6 cm × 5 cm to 16 cm × 9 cm. The folded flaps provided both inner mucosa and outer lining. All flaps survived. No fistula<disease> recurrence or stricture developed. After 6-24months of follow-up , six patients showed no evidence of disease , one was alive with disease , and one had died of local recurrence at 20 months. The folded flap was very reliable and is well-suited for repairing large PCFs , even early large PCFs and those featuring carotid artery rupture.
