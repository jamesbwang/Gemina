  This study was conducted over three consecutive years , 2015 , 2016 and 2017 , in the Imouzzer Kander region located in northwestern Morocco. The main objective is to evaluate apple tree responses to two sustainable deficit irrigation strategies with 75 % ( T2) and 50 % ( T3) of calculated crop evapotranspiration ( ETc) , compared to a control irrigated with 100 % ETc ( T1). During the three experiment years , estimated reference evapotranspiration ( ET
