  Allergic contact dermatitis<disease> ( ACD) is a common dermatologic disorder that is estimated to affect 15-20 % of the general population. Because of its prevalence , it may be expected that ACD should be easily recognized. However , it can present with many clinical variations that may complicate diagnosis. Although ACD is a treatable condition , patients from rural and underserved areas suffer if timely access to specialty care is limited. Dermatology Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes ( Dermatology ECHO) telemedicine sessions were created to mentor rural primary care providers ( PCPs). To illustrate their benefit , we present the case of a 19-year-old female patient who suffered from worsening undiagnosed ACD for over nine months following a laparoscopic appendectomy. During that time , the surgeon and multiple PCPs treated her with antibiotics , antivirals , and Scabicide without improvement in her condition. The de-identified patient case was presented by her PCP during the Dermatology ECHO session. The Dermatology ECHO specialty team mentored and educated the PCP in the diagnosis and treatment of ACD. After making the diagnosis , the patient received new treatment and her condition improved significantly. Dermatology ECHO provides a knowledge-sharing network for participating PCPs that may improve patient outcomes and reduce patient suffering.
