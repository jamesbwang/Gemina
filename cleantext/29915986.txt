  Preoperative carbohydrate loading ( CHO) is one element of the enhanced recovery after surgery protocol. No clinical trial has investigated the impact of preoperative CHO on intraoperative body temperature. This study was a single-center , prospective , randomized controlled clinical trial involving patients undergoing laparoscopic colon cancer surgery. The primary end point was the intraoperative core temperature during surgery , which was measured at 30-min intervals for 150 min after starting surgery. The secondary end points were short-term outcomes and body composition changes. From July 2013 to May 2014 , we randomized 70 patients into the control group ( n = 33) or CHO group ( n = 31); six patients were excluded. The core temperature of the CHO group 90 , 120 , and 150 min after starting surgery was significantly lower than that of the control group ( control vs. CHO , respectively: 90 min; 36.26 ± 0.41 vs. 36.05 ± 0.43 °C , p = 0.0233 , 120 min; 36.30 ± 0.44 vs. 36.06 ± 0.50 °C , p = 0.0283 , 150 min; 36.33 ± 0.50 vs. 36.01 ± 0.56 °C , p = 0.0186). We also found a significant difference in body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( control vs. CHO , respectively:- 1.6 ± 0.8 vs.- 0.9 ± 1.4 kg , p = 0.0304) and loss of lower limb<symptom> muscle mass (- 0.7 ± 0.7 vs.- 0.3 ± 0.6 kg , p = 0.0110) between the control and CHO groups , respectively. CHO had no effect on raising the intraoperative core temperature , and no negative impact on the perioperative outcome. CHO prevented the loss of lower limb<symptom> muscle mass , which may lead to better postoperative recovery.
