  A case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) is described in an HIV-negative patient with mixed connective-tissue disease ( MCTD) on a minimally immunosuppressive treatment with hydroxychloroquine. The patient presented with right-sided weakness<symptom> , episodes of disorientation<symptom> and loss of short-term memory and of vision in her right eye. PML was diagnosed by JCV DNA on cerebrospinal fluid and radiological criteria. She was treated with off-label maraviroc and mirtazapine but died two months after hospital admission , despite a surprising decrease in the viral load of cerebrospinal fluid three weeks after starting therapy. Prompt diagnosis and antiviral treatment of PML even in low-risk patients are warranted. Future studies are required to define the therapeutic role of maraviroc ( MVC) and mirtazapine in this setting.
