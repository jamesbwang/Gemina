  NaoXinTong Capsule ( NXT) , a Chinese medicine , is currently used to treat patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Clinical observations indicate its anti-diabetic functions with unclear mechanisms. Herein , we report the effect of NXT on diabetic nephropathy ( DN). Type 2 diabetic db/db mice were treated with NXT for 14 weeks. In the course of treatment , NXT reduced diabetes-increased glucose levels and improved renal functions. At the end of treatment , we found that NXT ameliorated serum lipid profiles and other biochemical parameters. In the kidney , NXT inhibited mesangial matrix expansion , expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A , fibronectin , advanced glycation end product and its receptor. Meanwhile , it reduced the diabetes-induced podocyte injury by increasing WT1 and nephrin expression. In addition , NXT inhibited accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins by increasing MMP2/9 expression through inactivation of TGFβ/Smad pathway and CTGF expression. Mechanically , NXT activated insulin signaling pathway by increasing expression of INSR , IRS and FGF21 , phosphorylation of Akt and AMPKα in the liver , INSR phosphorylation in the kidney , and FGF21 and GLUT4 expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Taken together , our study demonstrates that NXT inhibits DN by ameliorating glucose/lipid metabolism , maintaining tissue structure integrity , and correcting diabetes-induced renal dysfunctions.
