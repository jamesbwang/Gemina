Patients present their problems to health professionals looking for relief and a cure , while institutions collect data about symptoms of patients and the way health professionals treated them to support society 's care providers in administrating and managing care. The information on the problems of patients and the way health professionals treated them , which is gathered and stored in patient files , is valuable as educational material in the field of medicine. Driven by the fast developments of new technical tools case-based information , communication and education starts to enter educational domains beyond the field of medicine , such as school systems and public health services.
