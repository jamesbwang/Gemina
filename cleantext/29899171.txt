  Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH) is an autosomal-dominant disorder that is characterized by high plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-c) levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Despite the use of high-dose statins and the recent addition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors as a treatment option , many patients with homozygous FH fail to achieve optimal reductions of LDL-c levels. Gene therapy has become one of the most promising research directions for contemporary life sciences and is a potential treatment option for FH. Recent studies have confirmed the efficacy of a recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 vector expressing the human LDL-c receptor gene in a mouse model , and this vector is currently in phase 2 clinical trials. Much progress has also been achieved in the fields of antisense oligonucleotide- and small interfering RNA-based gene therapies , which are in phase 1-2 clinical trials. In addition , novel approaches , such as the use of minicircle DNA vectors , microRNAs , long non-coding RNAs , and the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system , have shown great potential for FH therapy. However , the delivery system , immunogenicity , accuracy , and specificity of gene therapies limit their clinical applications. In this article , we discuss the current status of gene therapy and recent advances that will likely affect the clinical application of gene therapy for the treatment of FH.
