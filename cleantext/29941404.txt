  Continuing professional development fosters advancement in knowledge and skills and can support changes in practice. Research suggests that pharmacists perceive the need for additional training to take on expanded roles. However , the types of professional development and preferred learning methods are unclear. To identify pharmacists ' professional learning needs in order to support expanded roles in practice. A mixed-methods approach was used. In focus groups made up of pharmacists and pharmacy students , learning needs associated with their perceptions of pharmacists ' roles were examined. A web-based survey of Albertan pharmacists determined the knowledge , experience , and confidence required to engage in professional activities , preferred learning methods , and professional development needed to support pharmacists currently and in future. Analysis of data obtained from 5 focus groups ( n = 42) revealed learning needs related to changes in pharmacists ' roles. Pharmacists valued the social aspect of learning as well as the role of certification in building confidence. Survey data ( n = 416) indicated that a high proportion of pharmacists reported training needs in the areas of physical assessment , interpreting laboratory tests , and making decisions about complex drug therapy. Community pharmacists and those with bachelor degrees were more likely to indicate a need for additional training in various patient care skills. Pharmacists reported a preference for learning with peers and learning at work within teams. Meeting various learning needs will foster pharmacists in their current and future professional roles , including situated learning in the workplace. These findings will be of interest to employers and educators in supporting pharmacists ' evolving roles in practice.
