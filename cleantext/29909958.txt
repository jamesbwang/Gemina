  Revision total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of taper corrosion has become increasingly common. The purpose of this portion of the symposium was to describe the most common complications of this procedure and to delineate specific measures that might be taken to prevent these complications. A literature review was performed focusing on the results and complications of revision total hip arthroplasty performed for taper corrosion. The most common modes of failure after revision total hip arthroplasty in the setting of taper corrosion include the 4 I 's: infection , instability , implant loosening , and ions ( recurrent adverse local tissue reaction). Strategies specifically directed toward each of these 4 failure modes have the potential to significantly reduce the risk of complications.
