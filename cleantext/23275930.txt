  Penetrating aortic ulcer<disease> ( PAU) and rupture of a superior mesenteric artery branch is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. We describe a case of 73-year-old man was brought to our Emergency Department for intermittent back pain. The final diagnoses are PAU ( Stanford B) and rupture of a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Two covered stents were placed in the thoracic aorta and the right external iliac artery , and the superior mesenteric artery branch was embolized. The patient subsequently underwent exploratory laparotomy , where 6000 to 7000mL of intra-abdominal hematoma was evacuated. After the operation , the patient recovered smoothly and was discharged 20 days later. During 3-year follow-up , the patient did not develop any pain or discomfort. Acute aortic syndrome<disease> ( AAS) and acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) may be difficult to distinguish , particularly for elderly patients with extensive atherosclerotic disease. Antithrombotic agent administration should be carefully considered.
