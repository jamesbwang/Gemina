  This study was performed to compare the: i) 1-year survival rate of patients with hip fractures , ii) factors affecting mortality in patients with hip fractures , and iii) results of functional recovery at commissioned hospitals ( CH) and veterans hospitals ( VH) to characterize the quality of care provided in the Korean commissioned hospital system. The study population consisted of 183 veteran patients ( 84 and 99 treated at a single VH and 39 CH , respectively) who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 2010 and February 2015. This study compared baseline characteristics ( i.e. , age , comorbidities , fracture types and surgical treatment approaches) of the two groups vs. clinical outcomes , and evaluated the waiting time , length of hospital stay , total medical expenses , mortality rate within one year , and functional recovery at last follow up. There were no significant differences in age , fracture types , comorbidities , ambulatory status before fracture , waiting time , or length of hospital stay between the two groups , however , the total medical cost was higher in the CH group ( The results of this study confirm that the Korean commissioned hospitals system is operating in accordance with its purpose. However , further studies are needed to better characterize the medical expenses of CHs vs. veterans hospitals.
