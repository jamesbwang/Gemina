  Zinc pthalocyanine ( ZnPc) is a second-generation photodynamic therapy ( PDT) sensitizer with sufficient PDT activity for squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC). ZnPc is hydrophobic and insoluble in water , which creates hurdles in systemic administration and hence restricts its use in clinic. Here we have loaded ZnPc on chitosan/methoxy polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid ( CPP) nanoparticles to form Z-CPP to enhance PDT efficacy. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to see dark toxicity of the compounds ZnPc , CPP and Z-CPP. Then PDT was done and its growth inhibitory effect on SCC cells was evaluated. In addition , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) formation and apoptosis of cancer cells following PDT were studied. The results showed that the tested compounds exhibit no dark toxicity and the effect of PDT was significantly better with Z-CPP when compared to free ZnPc ( P < .05). Photoactivation of Z-CPP led to a dose-dependent growth inhibition of cancer cells of > 50 % at 1 μM to > 80 % at 10 μM concentration. Also Z-CPP-treated cells had highest number of apoptotic cells and produced more ROS compared to free ZnPc-treated cells ( P < .05). Hence , this study suggests that Z-CPP is a suitable pharmaceutical compound to increase PDT efficacy.
