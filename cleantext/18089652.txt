  Spontaneous late-onset Alzheimer 's disease ( LOAD) accounts for more than 95 % of all human AD. As mice do not normally develop AD and as understanding on molecular processes leading to spontaneous LOAD has been insufficient to successfully model LOAD in mouse , no mouse model for LOAD has been available. Existing mouse AD models are all early-onset AD ( EOAD) models that rely on forcible expression of AD-associated protein ( s) , which may not recapitulate prerequisites for spontaneous LOAD. This limitation in AD modeling may contribute to the high failure rate of AD drugs in clinical trials. In this study , we hypothesized that genomic instability facilitates development of LOAD and tested two genomic instability mice models in the brain pathology at the old age. Shugoshin-1 ( Sgo1) haploinsufficient ( âˆ“) mice , a model of chromosome instability ( CIN) with chromosomal and centrosomal cohesinopathy , spontaneously exhibited a major feature of AD pathology; amyloid beta accumulation that colocalized with phosphorylated Tau , beta-secretase 1 ( BACE) , and mitotic marker phospho-Histone H3 ( p-H3) in the brain. Another CIN model , spindle checkpoint-defective BubR1
