  To investigate the risk factors of functional recovery after intramedullary nail fixation for femoral intertrochanteric fracture in elderly patients , and to propose corresponding measures to promote postoperative hip function recovery. From June 2012 to June 2015 , 74 patients after intramedullary nail fixation surgery were analyzed , including 33 males and 41 females , with an average age of ( 75.07 ± 7.89) years old , and divided into well-function group ( 55 patients) and bad-function group ( 19 patients) according to Sanders function criterion. Age , gender , bone density , fracture type , systemic<disease> disease<disease> , complication , rehabilitation exercises with therapist or not , nourishment state , anesthesia method , fracture reduction condition , ASA classification , tip apex distance were reviewed and analyzed by t test , non-parametric test , χ ² test and Logistic analysis. Univariate analysis showed that age , bone density , nourishment state , ASA classification , anesthesia method , fracture reduction condition , rehabilitation exercises with therapist , and tip apex distance were the risk factors for the recovery of hip function. Logistic analysis showed that bone density ( Bone density , rehabilitation exercises with therapist , ASA classification , nourishment state were the risk factors for the functional recovery of intramedullary nail fixation for intertrochanteric fracture in elderly patients. Multidisciplinary cooperation and fast track surgery system should be set up to promoting the hip functional recovery.
