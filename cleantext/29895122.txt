  Revision of the fourth edition of the World Health Organisation ( WHO) Classification of Haematopoietic and Lymphatic Tissues , which was published in 2017 , introduced important changes updating the biology , pathology , genetics , and clinical presentation of aggressive B-cell lymphomas. High grade B-cell lymphomas ( HGBLs) replaced B-cell lymphoma , unclassifiable , with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma , the new provisional entity Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberration was identified , and some categories were upgraded , e.g. EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , not otherwise specified. Still the histopathological diagnostics is based on morphology and immunoprofile , but to define the HGBLs evaluation of MYC , BCL2 , and BCL6 gene statuses is required. According to the presented WHO criteria , in the comprehensive histopathological diagnostics of aggressive B-cell lymphomas a highly specialised diagnostic team including a pathologist , a molecular biologist , a geneticist , a haematologist , and immunophenotyping technicians is needed.
