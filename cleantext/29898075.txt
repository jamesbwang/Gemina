  Psychiatric disorders frequently occur in patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS); however , limited reports are available on these comorbidities. We aimed to investigate the relationships among MS , anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , and suicidal ideation. One hundred and thirty two patients with relapsing-remitting MS were evaluated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale , Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory-II ( BDI-II) , Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation ( BSI) , and Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale. A hierarchical regression analysis was performed to evaluate the variables. The regression equation significantly predicted the BSI score ( R2 = 0.306; adjusted R2 = 0.273; F ( 9 , 125) = 9.18; p < 0.0005) , and the BDI-II score was the only variable that contributed significantly to this model ( p < 0.0005). A high prevalence of depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> , and a higher rate of suicidal ideation were identified in MS patients compared to the general population. The presence of depressive symptoms appeared to have a direct influence on the risk of suicide.
