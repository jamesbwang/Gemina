  The current practice of cancer genetic counseling is undergoing widespread change and scrutiny. While there are clinical resources for genetic counselors ( GCs) regarding the delivery of cancer genetic services , there is limited literature regarding effective management of a genetic counseling clinical program. We have developed administrative tools to manage a large team of GCs at a single academic medical center over a period of increasing demand for genetics services , with the initial aim of decreasing wait time for urgent genetic counseling visits. Here , we describe the three main elements of the clinical operations: Balancing patient volume between GCs , scheduling tracks for both routine and urgent appointments , and a team of triaging GCs to ensure appropriate patient referrals. For each of these elements , we describe how they have been modified over time and present data to support the utility of these strategies. The preliminary evidence offered here suggests that these tools allow for an equitable distribution of patient volume between team members , as well as the timely and accurate scheduling of urgent patients. As a result of the experiences presented here , other genetic counseling programs grappling with similar issues should be aware that it is possible to shift clinical operations to serve certain patient populations in a more timely fashion while keeping both providers and GC staff satisfied.
