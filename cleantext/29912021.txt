  To summarize the current advances in our understanding or the genetic basis of nonbacterial osteomyelitis<disease> Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis<disease> ( CRMO) is a complex genetic disorder. Past discoveries identified several single gene defects ( LPIN2 , Pstpip2 and IL1RN) that cause IL-1-mediated sterile multifocal osteomyelitis<disease> Recently Lorden et al. 's studies show that LIPIN2 deficiency can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through alterations in the function of P2X7 receptor providing evidence that Majeed syndrome<disease> is an NLRP3 inflammasomopathy. New gene discoveries include the identification of FBLIM1 as a CRMO susceptibility gene. Mutations in FBLIM1 were found in a consanguineous family with CRMO. Fblim1 is one of the most significantly differentially expressed gene in bone from chronic multifocal osteomyelitis<disease> ( cmo) mice , plays a role in IL-10-driven anti-inflammatory responses , and is involved in the physiology of bone remodeling. Lastly , new data on the putative CRMO susceptibility locus on chromosome 18 is presented here. Using Sanger sequencing , rather than microsatellite analysis , the DS18S60 susceptibility region could not be replicated in a larger cohort. CRMO occurs in humans , nonhuman primates , dogs and mice. There is a genetic component to disease but the genetic basis has only been identified for a small percentage of all cases.
