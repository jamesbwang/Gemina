  Disruptions to the circadian rhythm can lead to altered metabolism. Modification of thyroid function may be a reason why circadian misalignment may contribute to future metabolic disorders. We investigated whether circadian disruption through constant light ( LL) can lead to variations in hormone levels associated with thyroid function. Mice were exposed to LL or a 12:12 Light: Dark ( LD) cycle for 6 weeks; then glucose tolerance and thyroid hormone levels were measured at ZT 6 and ZT 18. There was day/night variation in glucose tolerance , but LL had no effect. LL reduced TSH , increased fT4 , and abolished day/night variation in fT3 and leptin. These findings illustrate that LL alters thyroid-related hormones , providing evidence of a link between circadian disruption and thyroid function.
