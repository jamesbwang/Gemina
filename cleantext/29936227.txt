  Recently , it has been demonstrated that Si-modified Pd catalyst shows excellent selectivity and produces less amount of green oil than the unmodified Pd catalyst in acetylene hydrogenation. Motivated by experiment works , we systematically investigate the mechanism of the selective acetylene hydrogenation reactions over pristine Pd
