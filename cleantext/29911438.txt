  Determine the optimal scoring system for evaluation of 6-week bleeding-related mortality in liver cirrhosis patients with acute variceal bleeding ( AVB). Prediction effects of six scoring systems , AIMS65 score , Glasgow-Blatchford ( GBS) score , full Rockall ( FRS) score , the model for end-stage liver disease ( MELD) , the MELD-Na model and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh ( CTP) score were analyzed in this study. A total of 202 liver cirrhosis patients with AVB were enrolled between 1 January 2014 , and 31 December 2014. All subjects were scored according to AIMS65 , GBS , FRS , MELD , MELD-Na and CTP scoring systems on the first day of admission. The primary endpoint of the study was 6-week mortality. The prediction effect of these scoring systems for 6-week mortality was compared by ROC curve and the area under the curve ( AUC). The scores of nonsurvival group evaluated by the AIMS65 , GBS , FRS , MELD , MELD-Na and CTP ( 2.6 ± 1.1 , 12.9 ± 2.7 , 6.6 ± 1.8 , 26.9 ± 6.5 , 31.6 ± 9.3 , 9.6 ± 2.2 , respectively) were higher than those of the survival group ( 1.2 ± 1.1 , 10.2 ± 3.4 , 5.1 ± 1.6 , 21.0 ± 6.4 , 22.8 ± 8.2 , 7.7 ± 2.0 , respectively) ( p < .01). The values of AUC and Youden index of AIMS65 and MELD-Na scoring systems ( ( 0.808 , 0.453) and ( 0.781 , 0.516) , respectively) were superior to those of MELD ( 0.761 , 0.454) , CTP ( 0.748 , 0.399) , FRS ( 0.738 , 0.358) and GBS scoring systems ( 0.726 , 0.370). AIMS65 and MELD-Na scoring systems are recommended for evaluation of 6-week bleeding-related mortality in liver cirrhosis patients with AVB.
