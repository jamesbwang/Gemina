  A simplified version of the human eye is known as a schematic eye model. Since the first attempts in the middle of the 19th century , numerous approaches describing new schematic eye models have been introduced. Some are able to describe the accommodation ability of the human eye. Accommodated schematic eyes could be of great interest because they explain the functionality of the human eye and they are easy to use for research purposes. Purposes include the design and testing of multifocal ophthalmic intraocular lenses , the evaluation of the effect of optical aberrations on retinal image quality , and the study of the optical performance of the eye at different distances after some refractive surgical procedures. This paper reviews and summarizes the most important features and details of accommodated schematic eye models that have been proposed in the past years.
