  Landmark advances in skeletal biology have arisen mainly from the identification of disease-causing mutations and the advent of rapid and selective gene targeting technologies to phenocopy human<disease> disease<disease> in mice. Here , we discuss work on newly identified mechanisms controlling the remodeling of bone , communication of bone cells with cells of other lineages , and crosstalk between bone and vital organs , as these relate to the therapeutic targeting of the skeleton.
