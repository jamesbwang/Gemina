  The impact of diet on breast cancer prognosis is poorly understood. Therefore , we conducted a literature search summarizing the current evidence on the effect of diet on breast cancer recurrence and mortality. The PubMed database was searched for original studies , reviews , and meta-analyses published between 2010 and 2017. Studies related to diet , dietary patterns , special diets or specific dietary factors , and breast cancer recurrence or mortality were included. Adherence to high diet quality indices ( relative risk ( RR) 0.74 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.60-0.90) and a prudent/healthy dietary pattern ( RR 0.76 , 95 % CI 0.60-0.95) may have a beneficial effect on breast cancer prognosis , whereas a Western/unhealthy diet is associated with poorer overall mortality ( RR 1.44 , 95 % CI 1.17-1.77). For low-fat diets , the findings are inconsistent. A positive effect of the Mediterranean Diet was found for all-cause mortality , but no beneficial effect from other diets such as low-carbohydrate , ketogenic or vegetarian/vegan diets was observed. Alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk for breast cancer recurrence. No general recommendation for soy exists , but occasional intake seems to be acceptable , whereas the use of other supplements is not justified. Adherence to high-quality diets and a prudent/healthy dietary pattern seem to be beneficial for breast cancer prognosis. No clear evidence for a benefit from special diets , soy products , or other supplements was found.
