  We consider the factors that govern the activity of bifunctional catalysts comprised of active particles supported on active surfaces. Such catalysts are interesting because the adsorption and diffusion steps , which are often discounted in `` conventional '' catalytic scenarios , play a key role here. We present an intuitive model , the so-called `` active doughnut '' concept , defining an active catalytic region around the supported particles. This simple model explains the role of adsorption and diffusion steps in cascade catalytic cycles for active particles supported on active surfaces. The concept has two important practical implications. First , the reaction rate is no longer proportional to the number of active sites , but rather to the number of ''
