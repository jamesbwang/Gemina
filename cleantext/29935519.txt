  The structural response of a set of charged nanoparticles confined to move on a spherical surface under the influence of an external field is studied by Brownian Dynamics ( BD) simulations and by an integral equation approach ( IEA). Considering an identical nanoparticle as the source of the external field , we analyze the force exerted by the N confined particles on the external one , as well as the corresponding potential energy , focusing on their dependence on the distance of the external particle to the center of the sphere r
