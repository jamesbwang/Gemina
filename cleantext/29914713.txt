  Urinothorax was first described in 1968 by Corriere et al. as the presence of urine in the pleural cavity due to retroperitoneal leakage of accumulated urine.

This is the first case of urinothorax that developed so tardive after radiotherapy and was diagnosed due to high clinical evidence despite the negative scintigraphy.
