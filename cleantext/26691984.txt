  The heterogeneity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) has made reliable stratification extremely challenging. Behavioral risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption contribute to this heterogeneity. To help elucidate potential mechanisms of progression in HNSCC , we focused on elucidating patterns of gene interactions associated with tumor progression. We performed
