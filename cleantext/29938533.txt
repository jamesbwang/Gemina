  Coronary artery disease is the most prevalent manifestation among cardiovascular diseases. Despite modern treatment , risk of ischemic complications in patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) remains important. The late Na The trial was designed in a 2-armed , controlled and randomized way. Twenty participants with unstable angina , proof of acute cardiac ischemia , and myocardial dyskinesia by speckle-tracking echocardiography were included. Ten participants received the study drug ranolazine additionally to standard treatment. The control group received standard treatment without additional study medication. Speckle-tracking echocardiography was performed before coronary intervention , before the first dose of ranolazine , and after 6 weeks of ranolazine treatment. Ranolazine was administered safely during acute myocardial infarction. Speckle-tracking echocardiography proved to be suitable for evaluation of myocardial dyskinesia. Patients receiving ranolazine showed a trend to higher normal fraction of the cumulative global strain than patients in the standard treatment group ( 15 % vs 11 %). No major complications relating study medication were observed. In conclusion , in this preliminary hypothesis-driven study , 6-week ranolazine therapy was shown to decrease the area of dyskinetic myocardium in patients with ACS by trend. Global strain rate measurement using speckle-tracking echocardiography can be applied measuring those effects and is , compared to other techniques , safe and harmless. Our data provide a sound basis for a follow-up trial.
