  Beta-blockers such as metoprolol , carvedilol , and bisoprolol are indicated for the treatment of patients with reduced ejection fraction heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> treatment guidelines call for titration of these medications to specific target doses for morbidity and mortality benefit. Hepatic enzymes are responsible for metabolizing these medications; however , these enzymes are subject to genetic variations ( polymorphisms) that can increase or decrease enzyme activity. Metoprolol relies almost exclusively on this enzyme for degradation to inactive metabolites , whereas carvedilol relies on this enzyme only partially for metabolism , and the portion of drug that is metabolized by CYP2D6 becomes active metabolites. The clinical significance of genetic variations in CYP2D6 in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients requiring treatment with carvedilol and metoprolol remains unclear , and further research is needed before any strong recommendations on treatment approach can be made. However , based on what is known regarding the incidence of genetic variations of this enzyme , it is reasonable to conclude that heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients of European and Asian ancestry may be at a greater risk of intolerance to guideline-directed doses of metoprolol. Patients of North African ancestry may be at a lower risk of intolerance to metoprolol , although limited data are available to conclude. Additionally , due to the significant prevalence of CYP2D6 enzyme variations among all ethnicities , it may be reasonable to consider switching to carvedilol for patients who are unable to fully titrate metoprolol.
