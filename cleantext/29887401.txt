  In Parkinson 's Disease ( PD) , measures of non-dopaminergic systems involvement may reflect disease severity and therefore contribute to patient-selection for Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS). There is currently no determinant for non-dopaminergic disease severity. In this exploratory study , we investigated whether quantitative EEG reflects non-dopaminergic disease severity in PD. Sixty-three consecutive PD patients screened for DBS were included ( mean age 62.4 ± 7.2 years , 32 % females). Relative spectral powers and the Phase-Lag-Index ( PLI) reflecting functional connectivity were analysed on routine EEGs. Non-dopaminergic disease severity was quantified using the SENS-PD score and its subdomains; motor-severity was quantified using the MDS-UPDRS III. The SENS-PD composite score correlated with a spectral ratio ( ( δ + θ)/ ( α1 + α2 + β) powers) ( global spectral ratio Pearson 's r = 0.4 , 95 % Confidence Interval ( 95 % CI) 0.1-0.6) , and PLI in the α2 band ( 10-13 Hz) ( r = -0.3 , 95 % CI -0.5 to -0.1). These correlations seem driven by the subdomains cognition and psychotic symptoms. MDS-UPDRS III was not significantly correlated with EEG parameters. EEG slowing and reduced functional connectivity in the α2 band were associated with non-dopaminergic disease severity in PD. The described EEG parameters may have complementary utility as determinants of non-dopaminergic involvement in PD.
