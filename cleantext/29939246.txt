  No data exists on inter-institutional differences in terms of adherence to international guidelines regarding the discontinuation of antithrombotics and rates of severe<symptom> bleeding<symptom> in coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG). This is an analysis of 7118 patients from the prospective multicenter E-CABG registry who underwent isolated CABG in 15 European centers. Preoperative pause of P2Y12 receptor antagonists shorter than that suggested by the 2017 ESC guidelines ( overall , 11.6 %) ranged from 0.7 % to 24.8 % between centers ( adjusted p < 0.0001) and increased the rate of severe-massive bleeding ( E-CABG bleeding grades 2-3 , OR 1.66 , 95 % CI 1.27-2.17; UDPB bleeding grades 3-4 , OR 1.50 , 95 % CI 1.16-1.93). The incidence of resternotomy for bleeding ( overall , 2.6 %) ranged from 0 % to 6.9 % ( adjusted p < 0.0001) and surgical site bleeding ( overall , 59.6 %) ranged from 0 % to 84.6 % ( adjusted p = 0.003). The rate of the UDPB bleeding grades 3-4 ( overall , 8.4 %) ranged from 3.7 % to 22.3 % ( p < 0.0001) and of the E-CABG bleeding grades 2-3 ( overall , 6.5 %) ranged from 0.4 % to 16.4 % between centers ( p < 0.0001). Resternotomy for bleeding ( adjusted OR 5.04 , 95 % CI 2.85-8.92) , UDPB bleeding grades 3-4 ( adjusted OR 6.61 , 95 % CI 4.42-9.88) and E-CABG bleeding grades 2-3 ( adjusted OR 8.71 , 95 % CI 5.76-13.15) were associated with an increased risk of hospital/30-day mortality. Adherence to the current guidelines on the early discontinuation of P2Y12 receptor antagonists is of utmost importance to reduce excessive bleeding and early mortality after CABG. Inter-institutional variation should be considered for a correct interpretation of the results in multicentre studies evaluating perioperative bleeding and use of blood products.
