  Viral pathogens are a common cause of severe lower respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> in adults. Our ability to rapidly and accurately identify viral<disease> infections<disease> has dramatically improved as slow culture-based techniques have been largely replaced by multiplex high-throughput systems. Given these advances , reevaluation of the role of respiratory viral testing in adults presenting with lower respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> is important. This article reviews the potential benefits of testing , provides an overview of the most commonly used diagnostic techniques , and considers whether current evidence supports routine testing.
