  Our previous studies showed that high salt tolerance in Tibetan wild barley accessions was associated with HvHKT1; 1 , a member of high-affinity potassium transporter family. However , molecular mechanisms of HvHKT1; 1 for salt tolerance and its roles in K +/ Na + homeostasis remain to be elucidated. Functional characterization of HvHKT1; 1 was conducted in the present study. NaCl-induced transcripts of HvHKT1; 1 were significantly higher in the roots of Tibetan wild barley XZ16 relative to other genotypes , being closely associated with its higher biomass and lower tissue Na + content under salt stress. Heterologous expression of HvHKT1; 1 in Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> ( yeast) and Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that HvHKT1; 1 had higher selectivity to Na + over K + and other monovalent cations. HvHKT1; 1 was found to be localized at the cell plasma membrane of root stele and epidermis. Knock-down of HvHKT1; 1 in barley led to higher Na + accumulation in both roots and leaves while overexpression of HvHKT1; 1 in salt-sensitive Arabidopsis hkt1-4 and sos1-12 loss-of-function lines resulted in significantly less shoot and root Na + accumulation. Additionally , microelectrode ion flux measurements and root elongation assay revealed that the transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibited a remarkable capacity in regulating Na + , K + , Ca2 + and H + homeostasis under salt stress. These results indicate that HvHKT1; 1 is critical in radial root Na + transport , which eventually reduces shoot Na + accumulation. Besides , HvHKT1; 1 may be indirectly involved in retention of K + and Ca2 + in root cells , which also improves plant salt tolerance.
