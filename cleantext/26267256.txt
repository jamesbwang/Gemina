  The aim of the study was to determine the reliability of parkour skills assessment in field conditions. Twenty young men completed three trials of a parkour obstacle course on two separate days. The tested group consisted of 10 beginners ( age 16 ± 1 years , body mass = 65 ± 12 kg , height = 177 ± 7 cm) and 10 advanced traceurs ( age 18 ± 2 years , body mass = 68 ± 14 kg , height = 178 ± 6 cm). The performance was video-recorded and subsequently analyzed by three raters ( total score 0 ⁻ 45). Median and percentiles were used to characterize results from all sessions by all raters. Inter-rater , intra-session and inter-session reliability were assessed using Krippendorff 's α for ordinal data. The Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the differences between beginners and advanced traceurs. Advanced traceurs obtained a total score from 41 to 44 whilst beginners achieved 27 to 33 points. Krippendorff 's α for total score ranged from 0.910 to 0.916 between raters , 0.828 to 0.874 between trials , and from 0.839 to 0.924 between days. The proposed parkour course differentiated two different ability levels and the skills assessment demonstrated excellent reliability between raters , trials , and days.
