  Repeat dose ( s) of antenatal betamethasone are recommended for women at < 32 weeks with ongoing risk of preterm birth. However , there is concern that use of repeat dose ( s) in fetal growth restriction ( FGR) may increase the risk of later cardiometabolic disease. We undertook secondary analysis of data from the Australasian Collaborative Trial of Repeat Doses of Corticosteroids Midchildhood Outcome Study to determine if FGR influences the effect of repeat betamethasone on growth and cardiometabolic function. At 6 to 8 years , children underwent anthropometry , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , intravenous glucose tolerance testing , ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> monitoring , and spirometry. FGR was defined as severe FGR at entry , cesarean delivery for FGR , or customized birth weight below the third centile. Of 266 children assessed , FGR occurred in 43 of 127 ( 34 %) exposed to repeat betamethasone and 44 of 139 ( 32 %) exposed to placebo. There was an interaction between FGR and repeat betamethasone treatment for the effect on height ( Repeat antenatal betamethasone treatment had no adverse effects on cardiometabolic function , even in the presence of FGR. It may have a positive effect on height in FGR. Clinicians should use repeat doses of antenatal corticosteroids when indicated before preterm birth , regardless of FGR , in view of the associated neonatal benefits.
