  The utilization of nanotechnology for the delivery of a wide range of anticancer drugs has the potential to reduce adverse effects of free drugs and improve the anticancer efficacy. However , carrier materials and/or chemical modifications associated with drug delivery make it difficult for nanodrugs to achieve clinical translation and final Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approvals. We have discovered a molecular recognition strategy to directly assemble two FDA-approved small-molecule hydrophobic and hydrophilic anticancer drugs into well-defined , stable nanostructures with high and quantitative drug loading. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that purine nucleoside analogue clofarabine and folate analogue raltitrexed can self-assemble into stable nanoparticles through molecular recognition. In vitro studies exemplify how the clofarabine: raltitrexed nanoparticles could greatly improve synergistic combination effects by arresting more G1 phase of the cell cycle and reducing intracellular deoxynucleotide pools. More importantly , the nanodrugs increase the blood retention half-life of the free drugs , improve accumulation of drugs in tumor sites , and promote the synergistic tumor suppression property in vivo.
