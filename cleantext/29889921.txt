  The purpose of this case series was to assess safety and feasibility of a novel resorbable collagen matrix ( CMX) to enhance tissue thickness simultaneous with implant placement and guided bone regeneration ( GBR) in esthetic sites over an 8-week healing period. Soft tissue thickness at implant sites and adjacent teeth was monitored with an ultrasonic device. Overall tissue contour changes were assessed by sequential digital surface model superimpositions. Periodontal parameters and patient-related outcomes revealed no significant changes. Combining a novel CMX and GBR revealed a significant soft tissue thickness increase of 1.56 mm at implant sites after 8 weeks , with no significant decrease between 4 and 8 weeks. The overall tissue contour increase was most significant at a distance of 5 mm from the mucosal margin , corresponding to a tissue increase at the implant shoulder area. No effect was observed at adjacent teeth after 8 weeks.
