  The purpose of this study was to compare the endotracheal tube cuff pressure changes during laparoscopic surgeries using air versus nitrous-oxide in anesthetic gas mixture; and to observe the incidences of postoperative sore<symptom> throat<symptom> , hoarseness<symptom> and dysphagia<symptom>. Total 100 patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic abdominal surgery were allocated into two groups. Group A ( n = 50) received air while Group N ( n = 50) received nitrous-oxide in anesthetic gas mixture. After endotracheal intubation , cuff was inflated with air to achieve sealing pressure. Cuff pressure at baseline ( sealing pressure) , 30 min , 60 min and 90 min was recorded with a manometer. Incidence of sore<symptom> throat<symptom> , hoarseness<symptom> and dysphagia<symptom> was noted at the time of discharge from post-anesthesia care unit and 24h after extubation. Cuff pressure increased from baseline in both the groups. The increase in cuff pressure in Group N was greater than that in Group A at all time points studied ( p < 0.001). Within Group A , cuff pressure increased more at 90 min than at 30 min ( p < 0.05). Within Group N , increase in cuff pressure was more at each time point ( 30 , 60 and 90 min) than its previous time point ( p < 0.05). The incidence of sore<symptom> throat<symptom> in post-anesthesia care unit was higher in Group N than in Group A. Use of nitrous-oxide during laparoscopy increases cuff pressure resulting in increased incidence of postoperative sore<symptom> throat<symptom>. Cuff pressure should be monitored routinely during laparoscopy with nitrous-oxide anesthesia.
