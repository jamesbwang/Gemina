  More than 80 % of the global population depends on traditional medicine for their basic primary health care needs. Africa has a well-established history of botanicals use. These include a vast array of compounds that can be used to treat various skin-related conditions. The rationale for the use of traditional medicine in skincare stems from the physical effects these compounds have on skin , such as the ability to control bleeding and speed up wound<disease> healing , as well as the potential to treat burns and other disorders of pigmentation. Most African traditional healers employ decoctions and infusion methods in medicinal plant preparations; the former entails boiling of the whole or parts of the plant in water or other solvents to extract the active ingredients. Infusions involve immersion of the plant in hot or cold water for some time , followed by topically application to the affected skin area. The cosmetic skincare products are formulated to protect , enhance , and preserve the skin in its healthiest state to maintain its barrier function , thus protecting the human body. This review examines a number of botanicals that are used across Africa and the phytochemical actives that are responsible for skincare.
