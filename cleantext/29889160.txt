  To make quantitative methods of nuclear medicine more available , four centres in Croatia participated in the national intercomparison study , following the materials and methods used in the previous international study organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA). The study task was to calculate the activities of four Ba sources ( T 1/2 = 10.54 years; E γ = 356 keV) using planar and single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT) or SPECT/CT acquisitions of the sources inside a water-filled cylindrical phantom. The sources were previously calibrated by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. Triple-energy window was utilized for scatter correction. Planar studies were corrected for attenuation correction ( AC) using the conjugate-view method. For SPECT/CT studies , data from X-ray computed tomography were used for attenuation correction ( CT-AC) , whereas for SPECT-only acquisition , the Chang-AC method was applied. Using the lessons learned from the IAEA study , data were acquired according to the harmonized data acquisition protocol , and the acquired images were then processed using centralized data analysis. The accuracy of the activity quantification was evaluated as the ratio R between the calculated activity and the value obtained from National Institute of Standards and Technology. For planar studies , R = 1.06 ± 0.08; for SPECT/CT study using CT-AC , R = 1.00 ± 0.08; and for Chang-AC , R = 0.89 ± 0.12. The results are in accordance with those obtained within the larger IAEA study and confirm that SPECT/CT method is the most appropriate for accurate activity quantification.
