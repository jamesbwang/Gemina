  Gastric cancer is the second most common malignancy , overlapping with thoracic esophageal cancer ( TEC). Among them , metachronous gastric tube cancers after TEC surgery have been increasing. The aims of this study were to examine the clinicopathological factors and treatment outcomes of gastric tube cancer ( GTC) after TEC surgery. Thirty-three GTCs in 30 cases after TEC treated between 1997 and 2016 were investigated retrospectively. Most cases were males. The median interval from TEC surgery to GTC occurrence was 57 ( 6.5-107.5) months. Almost 2/3 lesions<symptom> occurred in the lower third of the gastric tube ( 21/33); 29 lesions<symptom> ( in 26 cases) were superficial cancers , and 4 lesions<symptom> were advanced cancers. Twenty-two lesions<symptom> of superficial cancer were differentiated type , and the remaining seven lesions<symptom> were undifferentiated type. Treatment for superficial cancer had previously been performed with partial gastric tube resection ( 10 lesions<symptom>) , and the number of cases undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD) had increased recently ( 19 lesions<symptom>). Most cases with superficial cancer survived without relapse. Four lesions<symptom> of advanced cancer were found after a relatively long interval following TEC surgery. Most lesions<symptom> of advanced cancer were scirrhous , undifferentiated type , and they died due to GTC. GTCs may occur late in the postoperative course following TEC surgery. If they are discovered at an early stage , these lesions<symptom> can be cured with ESD. Long-term periodic endoscopic examinations after TEC surgery are important.
