  Capitellum fractures are rare in adolescents , and information in literature is still limited. The purpose of this study was to report the mid-term and long-term functional and radiographic results of 13 surgically treated adolescent capitellum fractures in a level I trauma center. This retrospective study included patients aged 10 to 16 years , who underwent surgery for a capitellum fracture and were followed up for at least 12 months. Fractures were classified according to the McKee modification of the Bryan and Morrey classification , and elbow arthritis<disease> was classified using the Broberg and Morrey system. Functional outcomes were assessed with the Mayo Elbow Performance Index ( MEPI) and the Turkish-language version of the shortened version of the Disabilities of Arm , Shoulder , and Hand ( QuickDASH) scale. The mean time to surgical intervention was 4.5 days ( range , 1 to 18 d). The mean flexion-extension range of motion arc was measured as 115 ( range , 45 to 150) degrees. The mean restriction for extension and flexion compared with the uninjured side was measured as 10.7 ( range , 0 to 45) and 11.5 ( range , 0 to 45) degrees , respectively. The mean MEPI was 87.7 points ( range , 50 to 100 points) with 9 patients as excellent , 1 good , 1 fair , and 2 poor results. The mean QuickDASH score was 11 ( range , 0 to 57). The mean MEPI score was 95.6 and 75 and the mean QuickDASH score was 2.62 and 25.0 for early surgery group ( â‰¤ 3 d) and late surgery group ( > 3 d) , respectively ( P = 0.073 , 0.024). Elbow joint contracture developed in 4 patients. Implant removal and open release of joint contracture was applied to 2 patients. Elbow arthritis<disease> of grade 3 was observed in 2 patients and grade 2 in 1 patient. Capitellum fractures may be easily missed on conventional radiographs , if not suspected. Delayed diagnosis may lead to a worsening of the functional outcomes. Computerized tomography is helpful in the determination of these fractures. Early diagnosis and a well-performed surgery is essential for successful outcome. Level IV-case series.
