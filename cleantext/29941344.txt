  Orthostatic hypotension<symptom> ( OH) has high prevalence in frail older adults. However , its effect on mortality , disability , and hospitalization in frail older adults is poorly investigated. Thus , we assessed the relationship between the prevalence of OH and its effect on mortality , disability , and hospitalization in noninstitutionalized older adults stratified by frailty degree. Prospective , observational study of 510 older participants ( â‰¥ 65 years of age) consecutively admitted to a geriatric evaluation unit to perform a geriatric comprehensive assessment. Clinical frailty was assessed using the Italian frailty index ( 40 items). Systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( mm Hg) , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( mm Hg) , and heart rate ( bpm) were evaluated in clinostatic position and after 1 , 3 , and 5 minutes of orthostatic position. OH was defined with a decrease of 20 mm Hg in systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and/or a decrease of 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. OH prevalence was 22 % , and it increased from 9.0 % to 66.0 % according to frailty degree ( P for trend < .001). When stratified by frailty degree , mortality , disability , and hospitalization increased from 1.0 % to 24.5 % , from 39.0 % to 77.0 % and from 14.0 % to 32.0 % in the absence , and from 0.0 % to 35.5 % , from 42.0 % to 95.5 % and from 19.0 % to 65.5 % in the presence of OH , respectively ( P < .01 vs absence of OH). Multivariate analysis showed that the Italian frailty index is more predictive of mortality , disability , and hospitalization in the presence than in the absence of OH. OH is a common condition in frail older adults , and it is strongly associated with mortality , disability , and hospitalization in the highest frailty degree. Thus , OH may represent a new marker of clinical frailty.
