  Diacylglycerol lipases ( DAGL) are responsible for the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. The fluorescent activity-based probes DH379 and HT-01 have been previously shown to label DAGLs and to cross-react with the serine hydrolase ABHD6. Here , we report the synthesis and characterization of two new quenched activity-based probes 1 and 2 , the design of which was based on the structures of DH379 and HT-01 , respectively. Probe 1 contains a BODIPY-FL and a 2,4-dinitroaniline moiety as a fluorophore-quencher pair , whereas probe 2 employs a Cy5-fluorophore and a cAB40-quencher. The fluorescence of both probes was quenched with relative quantum yields of 0.34 and 0.0081 , respectively. The probes showed target inhibition as characterized in activity-based protein profiling assays using human cell- and mouse brain lysates , but were unfortunately not active in living cells , presumably due to limited cell permeability.
