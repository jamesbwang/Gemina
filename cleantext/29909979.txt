  Quantification of analytes such as cytokines in serum samples is intrinsic to translational research in immune diseases. Optimising pre-analytical conditions is critical for ensuring study quality , including evaluation of cytokine stability. We aimed to evaluate the effect on cytokine stability of storage duration prior to freezing of serum , and compare to plasma samples obtained from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE). Protein stability was analysed by simultaneously quantifying 18 analytes using a custom multi-analyte profile in SLE patient serum and plasma samples that had been prospectively stored at 4 °C for pre-determined periods between 0 and 30 days , prior to freezing. Six analytes were excluded from analysis , because most tested samples were above or below the limit of detection. Amongst the 12 analysed proteins , 11 did not show significant signal degradation. Significant signal degradation was observed from the fourth day of storage for a single analyte , CCL19. Proteins levels were more stable in unseparated serum compared to plasma for most analytes , with the exception of IL-37 which appears slightly more stable in plasma. Based on this , a maximum 3 days of storage at 4 °C for unseparated serum samples is recommended for biobanked samples intended for cytokine analysis in studies of human immune disease.
