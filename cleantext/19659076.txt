  There is growing interest in designing waveguide couplers with low reflections. Using impedance-tunable transformation optics , we propose a coordinate transformation technique in the design of compact three-dimensional waveguide couplers. To transmit electromagnetic waves between two coaxial waveguides with different inner and outer radii in the microwave range , a suitable impedance function is derived to reduce the impedance mismatch at the boundary , which make the fabrication process being simplified due to the reduced set of transformation media ( dielectric response materials only). A larger refractive index is set to raise the coupling performance in the low frequency range. Next we apply impedance-tunable transformation optics to the design of dielectric waveguide couplers , where only the core region be contained in the transformed space; by selecting a tunable impedance function , waves can transmit efficiently through waveguides with quite different cross sections and background media. The proposed impedance-tunable three-dimensional waveguide couplers are confirmed by the 3-dimensional numerical simulation with good performances , which can have potential applications in fiber-to-chip coupling.
