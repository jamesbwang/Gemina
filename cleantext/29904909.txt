  Malignant mesothelioma ( MM) is a therapy-resistant cancer arising primarily from the lining of the pleural and peritoneal cavities. The most frequently altered genes in human MM are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A ( CDKN2A) , which encodes components of the p53 ( p14ARF) and RB ( p16INK4A) pathways , BRCA1-associated protein 1 ( BAP1) , and neurofibromatosis 2 ( NF2). Furthermore , the p53 gene ( TP53) itself is mutated in ~ 15 % of MMs. In many MMs , the PI3K-PTEN-AKT-mTOR signaling node is hyperactivated , which contributes to tumor cell survival and therapeutic resistance. Here , we demonstrate that the inactivation of both Tp53 and Pten in the mouse mesothelium is sufficient to rapidly drive aggressive MMs. Pten
