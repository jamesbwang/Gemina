  Sleep loss can result in cognitive , motor , and neurobehavioral impairments. In an aviation context , this can cause a serious threat to flight safety. Therefore , the study aimed to investigate the effects of 24-h sleep deprivation on mood , fatigue<symptom> , and airline pilot competencies. Seven subjects attended two 24-h testing periods , one with an 8-h sleep opportunity , and the other with no sleep opportunity ( i.e. , sleep deprivation). Subjects were required to complete a battery of mood , fatigue<symptom> , and analogue measures of pilot competency tasks every 8 h ( 0 h , 8 h , 16 h , 24 h) throughout each testing period. While total mood disturbance was found to significantly increase ( 83.42 , SD = 25.7) , both objective ( 352.71 , SD = 42.00) and subjective ( 34.85 , SD = 8.82) fatigue<symptom> were found to significantly decrease following 24-h sleep deprivation. Cognitive flexibility ( 757.45 , SD = 58.48) and hand-eye coordination ( dominant hand only) ( 60.28 , SD = 3.86) were also negatively impacted following 24-h sleep deprivation. However , working memory and situation awareness were not significantly negatively impacted by the bout of sleep deprivation. Some pilot-specific task-related factors such as subjective fatigue<symptom> , cognitive flexibility , and working memory were found to be particularly susceptible to sleep loss , with significant declines in performance observed following 16-h continuous wakefulness , suggesting reductions in optimal functioning following this period of wakefulness. Further investigation using more regular testing time points , employing additional pilot competencies , and using more aviation-specific tasks is warranted.O ` Hagan AD , Issartel J , McGinley E , Warrington G.
