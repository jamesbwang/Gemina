  Non‑small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) is one of the most severe malignant tumor types worldwide. Recent studies have reported an important role of PD‑L1 in mediating immune evasion in the tumor microenvironment. In addition , increasing research has indicated that the expression of PD‑L1 is related to the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition ( EMT) process , but the related mechanisms remain to be explored. In the present study , we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of PD‑L1 expression during the EMT process in NSCLC cells treated with transforming growth factor‑β1 ( TGF‑β1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2). The phenotypic alteration associated with EMT was evaluated by western blotting and confirmed by a wound‑healing assay. The results revealed that EMT markedly promoted the expression of PD‑L1 in the A549 cell line , while having no obvious influence on the H1650 and H1975 cells. Furthermore , the AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002 , the ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059 and the TAK1 pathway inhibitor 5Z‑7 inhibited the expression of PD‑L1 in A549 and H1650 cells , but not in H1975 cells , during the EMT process. Moreover , our study indicated that the AKT , ERK and TAK1 pathways regulated the expression of PD‑L1 by mediating transportation of the transcription factor Stat3 and the p65 subunit of NF‑κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , with such findings determined by western blotting and flow cytometric analyses. Furthermore , the expression of PD‑L1 was significantly increased following treatment with gefitinib in a tumor xenograft model. In summary , our results support the role of ERK , AKT and TAK1 in mediating the expression of PD‑L1 during the EMT process , and indicate a promising strategy of PD‑L1‑targeted therapy for the clinical treatment of NSCLC.
