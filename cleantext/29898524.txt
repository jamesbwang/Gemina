  Atmospherically-deposited nitrogen ( N) can stimulate complex soil N metabolisms and accumulations over time. Whether long-term ( decadal) N deposition effects on soil N transformations and functional microbes differ from the short-term ( annual) effects has rarely been assessed. Here we conducted a laboratory
