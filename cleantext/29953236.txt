  A fundamental understanding of the structure and dynamics of organic ionic plastic crystal ( OIPC) materials allows for a more rational design of molecular chemistry toward improved mechanical and electrochemical performances. This Letter investigates the solid-state structure and ion dynamics of two imidazolium-based protic organic ionic plastic crystals as well as the ion-transport properties in both compounds. A combination of DSC , conductivity , NMR , and synchrotron X-ray studies revealed that a subtle change in cation chemistry results in substantial differences in the thermal phase behavior , crystalline structures , as well as the ion conduction mechanisms in the protic plastic crystal compounds. Whereas most of the research nowadays has been focused on the optimization of chemistry of cations and anions , this work highlights the importance of microstructures on the ion transport rate and pathways of the OIPC materials.
