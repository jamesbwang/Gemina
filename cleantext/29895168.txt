  The severe shortage of donor liver organs requires the development of alternative methods to provide transplantable liver tissues such as stem cell-derived organoids. Despite several studies describing the generation of vascularized and functional liver tissues , none have succeeded in assembling human liver buds containing hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ( LSECs). Here , we report a reproducible , easy-to-follow , and comprehensive self-assembly protocol to generate three-dimensional ( 3D) human liver buds from naïve mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) , MSC-derived hepatocytes , and HSC- and LSEC-like cells. By optimizing the ratio between these different cell lineages , the cell mixture self-assembled into 3D human liver buds within 72 h in vitro , and exhibited similar characteristics with early-stage murine liver buds. In a murine model of acute liver failure , the mesenteric transplantation of self-assembled human liver buds effectively rescued animal death , and triggered hepatic ameliorative effects that were better than the ones observed after splenic transplantation of human hepatocytes or naïve MSCs. In addition , transplanted human liver buds underwent maturation during injury alleviation , after which they exhibited a gene expression profile signature similar to the one of adult human livers. Collectively , our protocol provides a promising new approach for the in vitro construction of functional 3D human liver buds from multiple human MSC-derived hepatic cell lineages; this new technique would be useful for clinical transplantation and regenerative medicine research.
