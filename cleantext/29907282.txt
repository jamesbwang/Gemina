  The high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization ( ESI) octopole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight ( TOF) mass spectrometry ( MS) was developed to separate secondary metabolites belonging to different groups of compounds with a wide range of polarity , i.e. phenolic acids , flavonoids , sesquiterpenes and others present in minute amounts , in a single run. Moreover , application of ESI-TOF-MS with a simple in source type of fragmentation and high mass accuracy measurements ( around 2 ppm) in both positive and negative ionization modes with different and optimized fragmentor voltages , enabled the identification of each single compound based on proposed fragmentation patterns. In this way a total number of 14 compounds in methanolic and water-methanolic ( 1:1 , v/v) extract from fruits of Eryngium amethystinum and 6 compounds in extract from fruits of E. planum have been identified for the first time. Additionally , two dimensional thin layer chromatography/high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray-ionization-time- of-flight mass spectrometry ( TLC/HPLC/ESI-TOF-MS) system was developed for identification of compounds with the highest anti-radical activity revealed in TLC-DPPH bioauthographic test. This on-line procedure enables significant improvement in terms of efficiency and faster structural analysis of the potential antioxidant natural compounds directly in the plant extracts screened for bioactivity tests. This effect- directed analysis ( EDA) method enables separation , identification and preliminary screening of plant extracts for anti-radical properties and can be easily adopted for other bioactivities.
