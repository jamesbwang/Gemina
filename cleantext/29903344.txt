  The burden oral anticoagulation is a limitation of mechanical valve prostheses. The aim of this study was to test whether patients could be safely managed with dual-antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT) ( aspirin 325 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg) or lower warfarin after On-X mechanical aortic valve replacement ( mAVR). PROACT ( Prospective Randomized On-X Anticoagulation Trial) ( n = 576) is a multicenter ( 41 sites) noninferiority trial. From June 2006 through February 2014 , 201 patients â‰¥ 18 years of age without thromboembolic risk factors undergoing mAVR were randomized to receive DAPT ( n = 99) or standard warfarin plus aspirin ( n = 102) 3 months after mAVR ( low-risk arm). From June 2006 through October 2009 , 375 patients with 1 or more thromboembolic risk factors were also randomized to lower intensity warfarin plus aspirin ( international normalized ratio 1.5 to 2.0; n = 185) or standard warfarin plus aspirin ( international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0; n = 190) 3 months after mAVR ( high-risk arm). The low-risk arm was terminated for excess cerebral thromboembolic events ( 3.12 % per patient-year vs. 0.29 % per patient-year , p = 0.02) in the DAPT group at up to 8.8-year follow-up ( 631.6 patient-years) , with no differences in bleeding or all-cause mortality. High-risk arm patients experienced significantly lower major ( 1.59 % per patient-year vs. 3.94 % per patient-year , p = 0.002) and minor ( 1.27 % per patient-year vs. 3.49 % per patient-year , p = 0.002) bleeding up to 8.7-year follow-up ( 2,035.2 patient-years) , with no differences in thromboembolism ( 0.42 % per patient-year vs. 0.09 % per patient-year , p = 0.20) and all-cause mortality. DAPT was associated with higher rates of thromboembolism and valve thrombosis compared with control in the low-risk arm. International normalized ratios were safely maintained at 1.5 to 2.0 in high-risk patients , without differences in mortality or thromboembolic complications.
