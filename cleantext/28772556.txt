  The present study focuses on the preparation and characterization of lab-scale aluminum syntactic foams ( ASFs) filled with hollow carbon spheres ( HCSs). A new and original process for the fabrication of HCSs was explored. Firstly , expanded polystyrene beads with an average diameter of 6 mm and coated with carbon fibers/thermoset phenolic resin were produced by the & ldquo; rolling ball & rdquo; method. In the next step , the spheres were cured and post-cured , and then carbonized at 1050 & deg; C under vacuum to form the HCSs. The porosity in the shell of the HCSs was decreased by increasing the number of impregnation ⁻ carbonization cycles. The aluminum syntactic foams were fabricated by casting the molten aluminum into a crucible filled with HCSs. The morphology of the hollow spheres before and after carbonization was investigated by scanning electron microscope ( SEM). The compressive properties of the ASF were tested and the energy absorption capacities were calculated according to stress ⁻ strain curves. The results showed that the ASF filled with HCSs which had been treated by more cycles of impregnation ⁻ carbonization had higher energy absorption capacity. The aluminum syntactic foam absorbed 34.9 MJ/m ³ ( 28.8 KJ/Kg) at 60 % strain , which was much higher than traditional closed cell aluminum foams without particles. The HCSs have a promising future in producing a novel family of metal matrix syntactic foams.
