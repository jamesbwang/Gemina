  Burn injuries raise questions about decision-making capacity , informed consent , medical decision making , patient autonomy , the patient-physician relationship , and medical futility that must be acutely addressed. A commonly used approach to managing ethical challenges focuses on moral principles including respect for patient autonomy , beneficence , nonmaleficence , and justice. Another paradigm for ethical analysis is the `` four-quadrant '' approach , which poses questions for a given case regarding medical indications , patient preferences , quality of life , and contextual features. We have found this approach to be very effective in the clinical setting. This article will highlight the use of the four-quadrant approach in the management of ethical challenges that arise in the care of the severely burned patient.
