  It is unclear whether white blood cell on admission has a prognosis value on ischemic stroke and whether its function is affected by other inflammation<symptom> factor. We hypothesized that elevated white blood cell is associated with stroke severity and 3-month mortality after acute ischemic stroke. A total of 3891 acute ischemic stroke subjects from the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke ( CATIS) were included in this analysis. Participants were divided into four groups according to quartiles of white blood cell on admission ( cutoff points for the quintiles: 5.60 × 109/L ,6.83 × 109/L ,8.50 × 109/L). The primary outcome was a combination of death and major disability ( modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 3) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were major disability , death and vascular events , respectively. After adjustment for major conventional risk factors , elevated white blood cell on admission was associated with poor primary and second outcomes after acute ischemic stroke. Compared with the lowest quartile , the ORs ( 95 % CIs) for the highest quartile were 1.79 ( 1.37-2.91) and 1.62 ( 1.21-3.55) for primary outcome in model 1 and model 2. In addition , there was a liner association between white blood cell and primary outcome at 3-months ( P for linear trend = 0.001). This analysis indicated that elevated white blood cell on admission is associated with 3-months poor prognosis in ischemic stroke patients independently of other inflammation<symptom> factor. The results emphasize the need of further research on the application of anti-inflammatory therapy.
