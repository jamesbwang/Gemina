  Oleosomes are stabilized by a complex outer phospholipid-protein-layer. To improve understanding of its structure and stabilization mechanism , this shell has to be studied in extracellular native conditions. This should be possible by SANS using contrast variation. Oleosomes are expected to be highly temperature stable , with molecular changes occurring first in the protein shell. Direct measurements of changes in the shell structure are also important for processing methods , e.g. encapsulation. Extracted soybean oleosomes were studied directly and after encapsulation with pectin by SANS using contrast variation. In order to determine structure and size , a shell model of oleosomes was developed. The method was tested against a simple phospholipid-stabilized emulsion. The oleosomes ' temperature stability was investigated by performing SANS at elevated temperatures. Size ( R
