  The classical roadmap of hematopoietic hierarchy has been proposed for nearly 20 years and has become a dogma of stem cell research for most types of adult stem cells , including hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs). However , with the development of new technologies such as omics approaches at single-cell resolution , recent studies in vitro and in vivo have suggested that heterogeneity is a common feature of HSCs and their progenies. While these findings broaden our understanding of hematopoiesis , they also challenge the well-accepted hematopoietic hierarchy roadmap. Here , we review recent advances in the hematopoiesis field and provide an updated view to incorporate these new findings as well as to reflect on the complexity of HSCs and their derivatives in development and adulthood.
