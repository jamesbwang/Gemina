  To explore the application of latent profile model in classification of health knowledge awareness in Guangzhou residents , and identify the characteristics of the heterogeneous population from multi dimensions.

Latent profile model was used to population classification based on health knowledge scores , and compared with traditional clustering method , the demographic and health behaviors with different levels of health knowledge were analyzed. Community residents were divided into three classes of health knowledge awareness model crowd by latent profile model , which accounted for 62. 2 % , 27. 4 % and 10. 4 % , respectively , was superior to the traditional cluster method. Therewere significant differences in the demographic characteristics of different health knowledge subgroups , people who is younger , low education , manual worker with weak health knowledge.
