  Triangular Ag nanoplates with a thickness of 5 nm and tunable edge lengths were fabricated using a seed-mediated protocol , featuring enhanced near-infrared absorption as the edge length of nanoplates increased. The photoacoustic ( PA) efficiency of these Ag nanoplates were assessed. Nanoplates with an edge length of 100 nm ( r1) performed best among others in the in vitro assessment. In the following in vivo test , r1 nanoplates were also found to boost the PA signal of tumor vessels , while a detailed PA imaging of tumor vasculature was obtained. The in vivo safety assessment of Ag nanoplates demonstrated that no apparent acute toxicity was observed to the heart , liver , spleen , lung and kidneys in mice with a single intravenous PA imaging dose of r1 nanoplates. Therefore , Ag nanoplates with the selected size have great potential as a new alternative PA contrast agent for quantitative imaging-based evaluation of tumor angiogenic vasculature and heterogeneity in tumor microenvironment. More importantly , controllable synthesis of nanoparticles would be an ideal route to optimize Ag nanoplates for biomedical application.
