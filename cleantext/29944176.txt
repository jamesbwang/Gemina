  The utilization of antiferroelectric ( AFE) materials is thought to be an effective approach to enhance the energy density of dielectric capacitors. However , the high energy dissipation and inferior reliability that are associated with the antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition are the main issues that restrict the applications of antiferroelectric ceramics. Here , simultaneously achieving high energy density and efficiency in a dielectric ceramic is proposed by combining antiferroelectric and relaxor features. Based on this concept , a lead-free dielectric ( Na
