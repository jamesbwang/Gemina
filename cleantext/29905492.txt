  The high-mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1) protein is a highly conserved nonhistone chromosomal protein ubiquitously present in almost all cell types. In the nucleus , it facilitates DNA repair and replication , V ( D) J recombination , stabilization of nucleosome , and in the cytoplasm , it regulates autophagy and apoptosis. In addition to these intracellular functions , HMGB1 also facilitates activation of innate immune responses and plays key roles in host defense. To investigate its role in fish , we cloned and characterized HMGB1 in Labeo rohita ( LrHMGB1) , the most important freshwater fish species in the Indian subcontinent. The full-length cDNA sequence of LrHMGB1 consisted of 787 bp having an open reading frame of 618 bp encoding 205 amino acids ( aa) polypeptide , with an estimated molecular mass of 23.61 kDa and isoelectric point ( pI) of 5.96. Motif search of LrHMGB1 revealed two homologous DNA-binding domains , the A-box and B-box comprising 8-78 aa and 94-162 aa , respectively , and a negatively charged acidic C-terminal tail ( 179-204) that consisted of 26 consecutive aspartic and glutamic acid residues. The amino acids sequence of LrHMGB1 protein and the secondary structure having helix ( H) and coils ( C) in tandem in the A- and B-box region and only coils in the acidic tail region shared significant similarity with mouse and human HMGB1. In addition to the three prominent motifs ( A-box , B-box , and the acidic tail) , the site of acetylation ( lys
