  We investigated the short-term effects of dapagliflozin as adjunct to insulin on insulin sensitivity , postprandial glucose excursions and ketone body production in type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM). A total of seven male patients completed the randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over trial , receiving 10 mg of dapagliflozin daily for 3 days , followed by placebo , or the reverse. At Day 3 , hyperinsulinaemic , euglycaemic clamps and oral glucose tolerance test clamps with repeated blood sampling were performed. Required glucose infusion and blood glucose excursions did not differ significantly between dapagliflozin treatment and placebo ( P = 0.491; P = 0.342). Prior to oral glucose , total ketone bodies showed a higher trend following dapagliflozin treatment ( P = 0.051). Following oral glucose , total ketone bodies decreased while concentrations of total GLP-1 were higher following dapagliflozin ( P = 0.009). Non-esterified free fatty acids did not differ between dapagliflozin treatment and placebo and ketonuria was absent under both conditions. In T1DM , short-term addition of dapagliflozin to insulin influenced neither postprandial glucose excursions nor insulin sensitivity. Following oral glucose , total ketone bodies decreased in parallel with an increase in GLP-1 concentrations , which were higher under dapagliflozin treatment as compared with placebo.
