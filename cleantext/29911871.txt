  Earth-abundant and well-defined iron complexes are found to be cheap and effective catalysts for a series of '' umpolung '' nucleophilic additions of hydrazones. The new catalytic system not only maintains the broad substrate scope of an earlier expensive ruthenium system but also attains chemoselectivity of different kinds of carbonyl groups. Furthermore , the iron catalyst enables this reaction at ambient temperature.
