  The neural extracellular matrix ( ECM) is enriched with hyaluronic acid , chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans ( CSPGs) and the glycoprotein tenascin-R , which play important roles in synaptic plasticity , as shown by studies of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. However , ECM molecules are strongly expressed in the CA2 region , which harbors a high number of fast-spiking interneurons ( FSIs) surrounded by a particularly condensed form of ECM , perineuronal nets. Despite this intriguing peculiarity , the functional role of ECM in the CA2 region is mostly unknown. Here , we investigate the acute and delayed effects of chondroitinase ABC ( ChABC) , an enzyme that digests chondroitin sulfate side chains of CSPGs and greatly attenuates neural ECM , on neuronal excitability and excitatory transmission in the CA2 region. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of CA2 pyramidal cells ( PCs) and FSIs in hippocampal slices revealed that 7 days after injection of ChABC into the CA2 region
