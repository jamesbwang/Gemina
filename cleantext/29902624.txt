  The aim of the study was to assess the relationships between vegetation , physicochemical and microbial properties of substrate at coal ash and sludge disposal sites. The study was performed on 32 plots classified into 7 categories: dried ash sedimentation ponds , dominated by a grass Calamagrostis epigejos ( AH-Ce) , with the admixture of Pinus sylvestris ( AH-CePs) or Robinia pseudoacacia ( AH-CeRp) , dry ash landfill dominated by Betula pendula and Pinus sylvestris ( AD-BpPs) or Salix viminalis ( AD-Sv) and coal sludge pond with drier parts dominated by Tussilago farfara ( CS-Tf) and the wetter ones by Cyperus flavescens<pathogen> ( CS-Cf). Ash sites were covered with soil layer imported as a part of technical reclamation. Ash had relatively high concentrations of some alkali and alkaline earth metals , Mn and pH , while coal sludge had high water and C , S , P and K contents. Concentrations of heavy metals were lower than allowable limits in all substrate types. Microbial biomass and , particularly , enzymatic activity in ash and sludge were generally low. The only exception were CS-Tf plots characterized by the highest microbial biomass , presumably due to large deposits of organic matter that became available for aerobic microbial biomass when water level fell. The properties of ash and sludge adversely affected microbial biomass and enzymatic activity as indicated by significant negative correlations between the content of alkali/alkaline earth metals , heavy metals , and macronutrients with enzymatic activity and/or microbial biomass , as well as positive correlations of these parameters with metabolic quotient ( qCO
