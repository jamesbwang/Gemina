  Ankle fractures are among the most common lower limb fractures. Associations between postoperative radiographic results and clinical outcome have been found , but less is known about the relevant ankle biomechanics. This study analysed ankle kinematics , radiographic findings and patient-reported outcome measures ( PROM) in patients treated for ankle fractures. The hypothesis was that patients after ankle fracture surgery had less flexion/extension in the ankle compared to healthy subjects and that fracture severity had significant influence on kinematics and patient satisfaction. Thirty-three patients ( n = 33 feet) operated for ankle fractures were recruited. Ankle kinematics were analysed using the Oxford Foot model , and results were compared with an age-matched healthy control group ( 11 patients , 20 feet). In addition , patients were divided by fracture ( severity) classification and kinematic results were correlated with PROM and radiographic findings. Patients treated for ankle fracture showed lower walking speed ( p < 0.001) when asked to walk in preferred normal speed. When compared at equal speed , significantly less range of motion ( ROM) between the hindfoot and tibia in the sagittal plane ( flexion/extension) during loading and push-off phases ( p = 0.003 and p < 0.001) was found in patients after ankle fractures compared to healthy subjects. Lowest ROM and poorest PROM results were found for patients with trimalleolar ankle fractures. There was a significant correlation between ROM ( flexion/extension) during the push-off phase and SF-36 physical functioning ( r
