  The ocular prosthesis is a modality of facial prosthesis that acts on the repair of loss or deformity of the ocular globe. Prosthetic rehabilitations destined to anophthalmic cavities that suffered cicatricial retraction represent a challenge during fabrication since they often need to be reduced due to atrophic of the cavity and simultaneously need to have a good esthetic appearance regarding the contour and artificial iris. This clinical report describes the ocular prosthetic rehabilitation of a 77-year-old man with anophthalmic atrophic cavity due to herpes<disease> zoster-induced loss. The treatment focused on comfort and adaptation during use , on satisfactory retention and esthetic appearance , and on care to achieve total eye closure while wearing the ocular prosthesis. This article shows an unusual prosthetic rehabilitation of atrophic anophthalmic cavity with 6 months of follow-up.
