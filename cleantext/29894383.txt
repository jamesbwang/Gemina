 : There are limited data on the effectiveness of dolutegravir ( DTG)- based combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART) in real-life settings in southern Africa where HIV-1 subtype C predominates. We report a patient infected with HIV-1 subtype C on DTG-based ART previously exposed to raltegravir who developed multidrug resistance mutations to four antiretroviral classes. There is need for drug resistance monitoring and clinical vigilance to ensure effectiveness of HIV<pathogen> treatment programs even in the era of DTG-based ART.
