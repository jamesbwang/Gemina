  The link between sleep apnoea and brain structure is unclear; although dysfunction of the hippocampus , middle temporal gyrus and brainstem/cerebellum have been observed previously. However , this link has been little explored in elderly subjects. The aim of this study was to explore the link between sleep apnoea and the brain in an elderly population .226 asymptomatic elderly subjects ( age mean ± sd 75.3 ± 0.9 years , range 72.3-77.8 years) from the PROOF ( Evaluation of Ageing , Autonomic Nervous System Activity and Cardiovascular Events) cohort study were explored using linear voxel-based or cortical thickness with apnoea/hypopnoea index ( AHI; mean ± sd 15.9 ± 11.5 events · h
