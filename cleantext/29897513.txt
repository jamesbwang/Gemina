  To evaluate changes in pro-atherosclerotic biomarkers and endothelial function in patients initiating two different PI-based regimens as part of ART. Prospective randomized 24 week study. Treatment-naive HIV-infected patients with CD4 + T cell count > 250 cells/mm3 started PI-based regimens including atazanavir/ritonavir ( Group A) or lopinavir/ritonavir ( Group B) and were followed up in an observational follow-up study until week 96. The expression of immune activation and adhesion molecules on CD4 + and CD8 + cells and plasma cytokine levels were assessed at weeks 0 , 4 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 and 96. Flow-mediated dilation ( FMD) , pulse-wave velocity ( PWV) and intima-media thickness ( IMT) were measured at weeks 0 and 24. Median changes within ( signed rank test) and between ( Wilcoxon test) arms were calculated. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled , of whom 15 were treated with atazanavir/ritonavir and 12 with lopinavir/ritonavir. After 96 weeks of ART , CD25 +/ CD8 + T cells and plasma concentration of MCP-1/ CCL-2 rose whereas CD44 +/ CD8 + T cells decreased significantly in both groups. Differences between treatments were noted for HLA-DRII +/ CD8 + , CD44 +/ CD4 + and CD11a +/ CD4 + , with significant increases in Group B versus Group A. No differences between groups regarding IMT , PWV and FMD were found at baseline and week 24. ART initiation with PI-based regimens led to a decrease in pro-atherosclerotic biomarkers at week 24 , which then rebounded at week 96. Lopinavir/ritonavir treatment resulted in an unfavourable modulation of such markers compared with atazanavir/ritonavir treatment.
