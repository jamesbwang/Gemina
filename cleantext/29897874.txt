  Learning-based hashing is a leading approach of approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval. In this paper , we develop a deep supervised hashing method for multi-label image retrieval , in which we propose to learn a binary `` mask '' map that can identify the approximate locations of objects in an image , so that we use this binary `` mask '' map to obtain length-limited hash codes which mainly focus on an image 's objects but ignore the background. The proposed deep architecture consists of four parts: 1) a convolutional sub-network to generate effective image features; 2) a binary `` mask '' sub-network to identify image objects ' approximate locations; 3) a weighted average pooling operation based on the binary `` mask '' to obtain feature representations and hash codes that pay most attention to foreground objects but ignore the background; and 4) the combination of a triplet ranking loss designed to preserve relative similarities among images and a cross entropy loss defined on image labels. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on four multi-label image data sets. The results indicate that the proposed hashing method achieves superior performance gains over the state-of-the-art supervised or unsupervised hashing baselines.
