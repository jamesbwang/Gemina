  Amines such as 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline undergo redox-neutral annulations with 2- ( 2-oxoethyl) malonates in the presence of catalytic amounts of benzoic acid. These reactions install a fully saturated five-membered ring and provide access to structures closely related to the natural products crispine A and harmicine.
