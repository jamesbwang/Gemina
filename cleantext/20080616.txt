  We present a rationale for , and results from , the pilot of a direct individual-to-institution remittance system in the context of school fee payment in rural Benin. Data confirm that school fees act as an impediment to educational attainment , and in very rural poor settings such as northern Benin , students often depend on extended family and kinship networks to pay fees. But existing remittance options are costly , in terms of fees , time , and risk. We pilot a new technology bundle in a single public high school in northeastern Benin , and evaluate its effectiveness. Here we describe the technical and institutional implementation of the project , as well as our findings from the first year of operation. We discuss takeaways and implications for scale-up.
