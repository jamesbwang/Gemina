  The presence of cancer cells in body fluids confirms the occurrence of metastasis and guides treatment. A simple , fast , and homogeneous fluorescent method was developed to detect cancer cells based on catalytic hairpin assembly ( CHA) and bifunctional aptamers. The bifunctional aptamer had a recognition domain for binding to target cancer cells and an initiator domain for triggering the CHA reaction. In the presence of target cells , the bifunctional aptamer was released from the inhibitor and initiated a cascade reaction of assembly and disassembly of the hairpins. Separation of the fluorophores from the quenchers produced fluorescence signals. The proposed strategy showed high specificity for discriminating normal cells and leukocytes , and the detection limit was 10 cells/mL , which was lower than that of previous aptasensors. This assay was further tested using four kinds of clinical samples spiked with target cells to confirm its applicability. We developed a simple , rapid , and cost-effective method for the detection of cancer cells that did not require purification , and the approach holds great potential for bioanalysis and early diagnosis.
