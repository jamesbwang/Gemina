  X‑box‑binding protein 1 ( XBP1) contributes to various types of cancer including breast , bladder cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of the study was to examine the metastatic role of XBP1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC) , and identify possible downstream molecules. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted on tissue microarrays comprising 96 OSCC cases to determine the expression level of XBP1 and analyze its association with metastasis , clinicopathological characteristics and survival prognosis. Compared with the adjacent normal tissues of OSCC , the expression of XBP1 was significantly increased in the tumor center and front area , and lymph nodes metastases ( P < 0.05). A relatively high XBP1 expression was associated with histological grades ( P < 0.05) , advanced clinical stages ( P < 0.05) , unfavorable 5‑year survival ( P = 0.027). Suppressed XBP1 expression caused a significant reduction of cell invasion capability ( P < 0.05). AXL and the downstream molecules , such as PI3K , MMP1 , MMP3 , and uPA were significantly suppressed when XBP1 expression was inhibited in OSCC cells. Once XBP1 was activated by Thapsigargin , AXL expression was restored. Moreover , aberrant AXL expression was associated with XBP1 overexpression in OSCC tissues ( P < 0.05). In conclusion , XBP1 is a potential target that is relevant to suppressing cell invasion and is associated with patient prognosis in OSCC.
