  Morphological differences between mammalian hair types are useful for species distinction. Differences in animal hair structure are observed between species , whereas there may be breed differences within a species. Guard hair structure may vary between different dog breeds. Hair samples were collected from 73 dogs of four breed types ( wire-haired Dachshund , Labrador retriever , German shepherd dog and Yorkshire terrier). Hair was measured and analysed by scanning electron microscopy. The following were evaluated: hair thickness; medulla to hair cross-sectional area ratio; scale density , pattern and margins; and medulla shape , composition and structure. There were significant differences in all measured parameters between breeds. These study findings may be useful for the study of classifying dog breeds and for forensic identification of a dog breed through hair sampling.
