  Lengthy review times for institutional review boards ( IRBs) are a well-known barrier to research. In response to numerous calls to reduce review times , we devised `` Real-Time IRB , '' a process that drastically reduces IRB review time. In this , investigators and study staff attend the IRB meeting and make changes to the protocol while the IRB continues its meeting , so that final approval can be issued at the meeting. This achieved an overall reduction in time from submission to the IRB to final approval of 40 %. While this process is time and resource intensive , and can not address all delays in research , it shows great promise for increasing the pace by which research is translated to patient care.
