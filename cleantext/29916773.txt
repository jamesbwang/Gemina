  Purpose To determine rate of malignancy at stereotactic biopsy of amorphous calcifications with different distributions using current imaging , clinical , and histopathologic criteria. Materials and Methods From January 2009 to September 2013 , this retrospective study reviewed a large set of stereotactic biopsies to identify amorphous calcifications and their clinical , imaging , and histopathologic characteristics. Calcification distribution was correlated with malignancy rate after adjusting for known risk factors using logistic regression. Results Of 1903 sequential biopsies , 546 ( 28.7 %) were for amorphous calcifications. After excluding atypical lesions<symptom> not excised and patients with more than one biopsy in the same year , 497 lesions<symptom> from 494 women ( median age , 52 years; age range , 30-81 years) remained. Fifty-two ( 10.5 %; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 7.9 , 13.5) lesions<symptom> proved malignant , with 17 of 52 ( 42.7 %) being invasive cancers ( median , 0.3 cm; range , 0.1-1.3 cm) and all 17 of them being estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and node negative. Malignancy rates in a segmental ( six of 21 ( 28.6 %)) , linear ( eight of 32 ( 25.0 %)) , or multiple group same quadrant<symptom> ( nine of 36 ( 25.0 %)) distribution were significantly higher than malignancy rate in a solitary group of amorphous calcifications ( 25 of 356 ( 7.0 %)) ( P = .004 , P = .003 , and P = .002 , respectively). Of 356 grouped amorphous calcifications , 102 ( 28.7 %) yielded atypical results prompting excision , with three of 102 ( 2.9 %) upgraded to ductal carcinoma in situ at excision. In women younger than 50 years without a personal history of cancer , grouped amorphous calcifications showed four of 127 ( 3.1 %) ( 95 % CI: 0.9 , 7.9) were malignant and 39 of 127 ( 30.7 %) were atypical at final histopathology. Conclusion Biopsy of amorphous calcifications remains necessary , with an overall malignancy rate of 10.5 %; only 17 of 497 ( 3.4 %) biopsies showed invasive cancer , and all of these were estrogen and progesterone receptor positive. Grouped amorphous calcifications in women younger than 50 years without history of breast or ovarian cancer showed a low malignancy rate of 3.1 % ( four of 127).
