  Catheter ablation is a good treatment option for atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) in young symptomatic patients. However , there is little information on the efficacy of catheter ablation of early-onset AF between sexes.Methods and Results: This study included 1,060 patients under the age 60 years old ( 837 men , 49.8 ± 7.7 years old , 70.8 % paroxysmal AF) who underwent catheter ablation for AF. Sex differences in clinical presentation and ablation outcomes were compared with and without propensity score-matching. During 24.5 ± 18.9 months of follow-up , women showed significantly higher clinical recurrence of AF than men ( log-rank , P = 0.002). Female sex was independently associated with post-ablation clinical recurrence of AF ( adjusted hazard ratio ( HR) 2.58 ( 1.06-6.30) , P = 0.037). Women had a higher proportion of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction ( E/Em , P < 0.001) , higher prevalence of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( P = 0.017) , greater left atrial<symptom> ( LA) volume index ( P = 0.001) , lower LA endocardial voltage ( P < 0.001) , and higher parasympathetic nervous activity ( root-mean square of differences , P < 0.001; high-frequency ( HF) , P = 0.010) than men. After a second ablation procedure ( n = 111) , women still showed a higher clinical recurrence rate than men ( log-rank , P = 0.003) during 22.9 ± 15.0 months of follow-up. Among patients with early-onset AF who underwent catheter ablation , women showed poorer clinical outcomes than men after de novo and second procedures. Left ventricular dysfunction , LA remodeling , and autonomic nervous function may be potential mechanisms underlying sex differences in catheter ablation outcomes of early-onset AF.
