  Condyloma acuminata ( CA) is mainly caused by human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) types<pathogen> 6 and 11. Clinicians use many different methods to treat analcondyloma acuminate ( CA). In this study , we aimed to compare electrocautery ablation ( ECA) and argon plasma coagulation ( APC) techniques in terms of postoperative bleeding , pain , scar development , loss of sexual sensation , and recurrence rates. A retrospective analysis of collected data was performed for 49consecutive patients with CA , who underwent surgery between July 2011 and July 2014. Patients were grouped and evaluated according to surgical technique , including an ECA group and an APC group. Postoperative bleeding was determined by the number of dressings used in the first postoperative week. Scar severity in the perianal region following ablation therapy was evaluated by scar diameter. A visual analog scale ( VAS) was used to measure pain and loss of sexual sensation. All patients were followed for 9 months. There were statistically significant differences between the ECA and APC groups in terms of postoperative bleeding , pain , scar development , and loss of sexual sensation. No difference in recurrence rate was observed. APC is a safe and effective alternative for the surgical treatment of patients with CA. Although it appears to be more comfortable than ECA techniques , more randomized controlled trials are necessary to reinforce this claim.
