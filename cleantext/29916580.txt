  In this study , the daily exposure action values ( EAV) and the daily exposure limit values ( ELV) for hand-transmitted vibration ( HTV) and whole-body vibration ( WBV) , established by the EU Directive 2002/44/EC and the Italian Decree 81/2008 , and expressed in terms of 8-hr frequency weighted r.m.s. acceleration magnitude , are discussed upon consideration of the findings of experimental and epidemiological studies. There is some epidemiological support for the EAV A ( 8) of 2.5 ms-2 r.m.s. and the ELV A ( 8) of 5 ms-2 r.m.s. for HTV , at least for the vascular component ( secondary Raynaud 's phenomenon) of the hand-arm vibration syndrome<disease>. There is some experimental evidence for the EAV A ( 8) of 0.5 ms-2 r.m.s. for WBV , while there is neither biodynamic nor epidemiological validation for the ELV A ( 8) of 1.15 ms-2 r.m.s. for WBV , this latter lowered to 1 ms-2 r.m.s. in the Italian legislation.
