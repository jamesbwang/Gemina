  Seed germination responsiveness to environmental cues is crucial for plant species living in changeable habitats and can vary among populations within the same species as a result of adaptation or modulation to local climates. Here , we investigate the germination response to environmental cues of Sisymbrella dentata ( L.) O.E. Schulz , an annual endemic to Sicily living in Mediterranean Temporary Ponds ( MTP) , a vulnerable ecosystem. Germination of the only two known populations , Gurrida and Pantano , was assessed over a broad range of conditions to understand the role of temperatures , nitrate , hormones ( abscisic acid- ABA and gibberellins- GA) and after-ripening in dormancy release in this species. Seed germination responsiveness varied between the two populations , with seeds from Gurrida germinating under a narrower range of conditions. Overall , this process in S. dentata consisted of testa and endosperm rupture as two sequential events , influenced by ABA and GA biosynthesis. Nitrate addition caused an earlier testa rupture , after-ripening broadened the thermal conditions that allow germination , and alternating temperatures significantly promoted germination of non-after-ripened seeds. Primary dormancy in S. dentata seeds likely allows this plant to form a persistent seed bank that is responsive to specific environmental cues characteristic of MTP habitats.
