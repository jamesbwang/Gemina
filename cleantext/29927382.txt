  Newfoundland and Labrador ( NL) has the highest prevalence of diabetes in Canada. In 2011 , Eastern Health ( EH) selected diabetes as its chronic<disease> disease<disease> management focus in response to national statistics on the disease. In 2012 , EH partnered with Saint Elizabeth ( SE) to offer a free e-learning module on diabetes management to its healthcare providers. In this paper , the Engage Others domain of the LEADS in a Caring Environment Framework is used to describe the EH-SE partnership for this e-learning including strategies used to engage nursing and allied health staff.
