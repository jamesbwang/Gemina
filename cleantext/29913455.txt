  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is a common ailment. It is usually found in association with diabetes or obesity. There are no approved drugs to treat this condition. The study of flavonoid consumption has increased over the decades due to their antioxidative properties , although the literature is scarce when it comes to their effects in liver tissue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of leucoanthocyanidin in nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis. Thirty male albino rabbits were divided in 3 groups. Group 1 had a regular commercial diet. The second group had a regular diet and 10 mL of egg yolk and 1.5 g of pure cholesterol. The rabbits of the third group were on the same regimen as the second , but were also treated with grape leucoanthocyanidin ( 50 mg/kg/day) for 100 days. On the last day of the experiment , the animals were euthanized , and the livers excised and fixated in a 10 % formalin solution. Afterwards , fragments of each liver were removed and histologically processed and analyzed. The stereological evaluation showed that leucoanthocyanidin reduced NAFLD in comparison with the nontreated group. This was also observed in the histological analysis of the liver tissue , as the treated group had less foci of fatty tissue. Leucoanthocyanidin may therefore be a promising substance to treat NAFLD , although further studies are needed.
