  Most lung transplantation immunosuppression regimens include tacrolimus. Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in genes important to tacrolimus bioavailability and clearance ( ABCB1 , CYP3A4 , and CYP3A5) are associated with differences in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in these genes would impact immunosuppression-related outcomes. We categorized ABCB1 , CYP3A4 , and CYP3A5 SNPs for 321 lung allograft recipients. Genotype effects on time to therapeutic tacrolimus level , interactions with antifungal medications , concentration to dose ( C
