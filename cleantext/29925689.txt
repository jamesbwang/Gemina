  Generation of homogeneous populations of subtype-specific cardiomyocytes ( CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) and their comprehensive phenotyping is crucial for a better understanding of the subtype-related disease mechanisms and as tools for the development of chamber-specific drugs. The goals of this study were to apply a simple and efficient method for differentiation of iPSCs into defined functional CM subtypes in feeder-free conditions and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular , cell biological , and functional properties of atrial<symptom> and ventricular iPSC-CMs on both the single-cell and engineered heart<symptom> muscle ( EHM) level. By a stage-specific activation of retinoic acid signaling in monolayer-based and well-defined culture , we showed that cardiac progenitors can be directed towards a highly homogeneous population of atrial CMs. By combining the transcriptome and proteome profiling of the iPSC-CM subtypes with functional characterizations via optical action potential and calcium imaging , and with contractile analyses in EHM , we demonstrated that atrial<symptom> and ventricular iPSC-CMs and- EHM highly correspond to the atrial<symptom> and ventricular heart<symptom> muscle , respectively. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and functional identities characteristic of atrial and ventricular iPSC-CMs and- EHM and supports their suitability in disease modeling and chamber-specific drug screening.
