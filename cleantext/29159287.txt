  In this paper , molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the annealing process of & gamma;- TiAl alloy with different parameters after introducing residual stress into prepressing. By mainly focusing on the dynamic evolution process of microdefects during annealing and the distribution of residual stress , the relationship between microstructure and residual stress is investigated. The results show that there is no phase transition during annealing , but atom distortion occurs with the change of temperature , and the average grain size slightly increases after annealing. There are some atom clusters in the grains , with a few point defects , and the point defect concentration increases with the rise in temperature , and vice versa; the higher the annealing temperature , the fewer the point defects in the grain after annealing. Due to the grain boundary volume shrinkage and and an increase in the plastic deformation of the grain boundaries during cooling , stress is released , and the average residual stress along Y and Z directions after annealing is less than the average residual stress after prepressing.
