  The primary cilium functions as an `` antenna '' for cell signaling , studded with characteristic transmembrane receptors and soluble protein factors , raised above the cell surface. In contrast to the transmembrane proteins , targeting mechanisms of nontransmembrane ciliary proteins are poorly understood. We focused on a pathogenic mutation that abolishes ciliary localization of retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein and revealed a dual acylation-dependent ciliary targeting pathway. Short N-terminal sequences which contain myristoylation and palmitoylation sites are sufficient to target a marker protein into the cilium in a palmitoylation-dependent manner. A Golgi-localized palmitoyltransferase DHHC-21 was identified as the key enzyme controlling this targeting pathway. Rapid turnover of the targeted protein was ensured by cholesterol-dependent membrane fluidity , which balances highly and less-mobile populations of the molecules within the cilium. This targeting signal was found in a set of signal transduction molecules , suggesting a general role of this pathway in proper ciliary organization , and dysfunction in ciliary disorders.
