  Previously , a number of microRNAs ( miRs) have been identified to participate in the development and progression of glioma via the regulation of their target genes. However , the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of miR-423-3p in glioma growth remain unclear. In the present study , the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to assess the mRNA and protein expression levels of miR-423-3p , respectively. An MTT assay and flow cytometry were performed to determine cell proliferation and apoptosis , respectively. A luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to determine the target association between pannexin 2 ( PANX2) and miR-423-3p. It was revealed that miR-423-3p was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues , and the increased expression of miR-423-3p was significantly associated with an advanced grade as well as a poorer prognosis of patients with glioma. Inhibition of miR-423-3p using an miR-423-3p inhibitor resulted in the decreased proliferation of glioma U251 and U87MG Uppsala cells , and the induction of apoptosis. PANX2 was identified as a novel target gene of miR-423-3p , and the expression of PANX2 was revealed to be increased in U251 and U87MG Uppsala cells when miR-423-3p was inhibited. Knockdown of PANX2 attenuated the effects of miR-423-3p inhibition on glioma cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore , PANX2 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues , and its levels were markedly lower in World Health Organization ( WHO) stage III-IV gliomas compared with WHO stage I-II gliomas. Additionally , the expression levels of PANX2 were identified to be inversely correlated with miR-423-3p expression levels in glioma tissues. Consequently , targeting miR-423-3p may inhibit glioma growth via the upregulation of PANX2.
