  The place and significance of troponin testing in acute burn injuries has not yet been established. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence and pattern of troponin testing within a large population of acute burn injuries and subsequently to determine the resultant clinical significance of the troponin test results. A retrospective analysis of all patients with acute burn admissions ( n = 1,621 patients) to a busy tertiary adult burns center between July 2009 and July 2015. More than a third of our patients had at least one troponin test performed. Men , the elderly , and those with larger burns were more likely to be tested. The majority tested had the laboratory test done within 24 hours of admission. A positive troponin test strongly correlated with increased risk of acute cardiac complication and death , as did burns greater than 15 % total body surface area ( % TBSA) and age. Acute burns of ≥ 15 % TBSA are associated with elevated troponin levels. Troponins should be tested in those ≥ 50 years old , with significant burns , and/or premorbid cardiac disease; positive results investigated as they affect cardiac and survival outcomes.
