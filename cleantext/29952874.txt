J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The second lactate threshold ( LT2) has previously been associated with endurance performance; however , comparisons between sexes are lacking regarding its efficacy. The aim of this study was to compare LT2 between men and women , specifically regarding its ( a) relationship with endurance performance and ( b) capacity to establish training and competition intensities. Competitive male ( mean ± SD: age , 27.7 ± 4.7 years; V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max , 59.7 ± 5.2 ml · kg · min; n = 10) and female ( mean ± SD: age , 27.3 ± 6.2 years; V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max , 54.5 ± 5.3 ml · kg · min; n = 12) cyclists and triathletes completed an incremental cycle trial to volitional fatigue<symptom> ( for determination of V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max and LT2 via the modified D-max method) , a constant load ( ± 5 %) exercise trial of 30 minutes at LT2 power output , and a 40-km cycle time trial. The LT2 significantly correlated with 40-km cycling performance in both men ( r = -0.69 to -0.77; p < 0.01-0.05) and women ( r = -0.63 to -0.75; p < 0.01-0.05). All men sustained LT2 power output for 30 minutes , compared with 82 % of women. Despite LT2 reflecting a similar heart rate , V ( Combining Dot Above) O2 , and ( La) to those elicited during a 40-km time trial in both men and women , power output at LT2 was 6 % higher ( p < 0.05) than mean time trial power output in women , with no significant difference in men. Based on these findings , sex-specific recommendations have been suggested in regard to the use of LT2 for establishing performance potential , prescribing endurance training intensities and setting 40-km performance intensity.
