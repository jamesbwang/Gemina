  The development of immune protective islet encapsulation devices could allow for islet transplantation in the absence of immunosuppression. However , the immune protective membrane/ barrier introduced there could also impose limitations in transport of oxygen and nutrients to the encapsulated cells resulting to limited islet viability. In the last years , it is well understood that achieving prevascularization of the device in vitro could facilitate its connection to the host vasculature after implantation , and therefore could provide sufficient blood supply and oxygenation to the encapsulated islets. However , the microvascular networks created in vitro need to mimic well the highly organized vasculature of the native tissue. In earlier study , we developed a functional macroencapsulation device consisting of two polyethersulfone/polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PES/PVP) membranes<symptom> , where a bottom microwell membrane provides good separation of encapsulated islets and the top flat membrane acts as a lid. In this work , we investigate the possibility of creating early microvascular networks on the lid of this device by combining novel membrane microfabrication with co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC) and fibroblasts. We create thin porous microstructured PES/PVP membranes<symptom> with solid and intermittent line-patterns and investigate the effect of cell alignment and cell interconnectivity as a first step towards the development of a stable prevascularized layer in vitro. Our results show that , in contrast to non-patterned membranes<symptom> where HUVECs form unorganized HUVEC branch-like structures , for the micropatterned membranes<symptom> , we can achieve cell alignment and the co-culture of HUVECs on a monolayer of fibroblasts attached on the membranes<symptom> with intermittent line-pattern allows for the creation of HUVEC branch-like structures over the membrane surface. This important step towards creating early microvascular networks was achieved without the addition of hydrogels , often used in angiogenesis assays , as gels could block the pores of the membrane and limit the transport properties of the islet encapsulation device.
