  The organosulfur metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate ( DMSP) and its enzymatic breakdown product dimethyl sulfide ( DMS) have important implications in the global sulfur cycle and in marine microbial food webs. Enormous amounts of DMSP are produced in marine environments where microbial communities import and catabolize it via either the demethylation or the cleavage pathways. The enzymes that cleave DMSP are termed `` DMSP lyases '' and generate acrylate or hydroxypropionate , and ~ 10
