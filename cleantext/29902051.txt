  Reports an error in `` Implicit alcohol associations , especially drinking identity , predict drinking over time '' by Kristen P. Lindgren , Clayton Neighbors , Bethany A. Teachman , Scott A. Baldwin , Jeanette Norris , Debra Kaysen , Melissa L. Gasser and Reinout W. Wiers ( A sample of 506 undergraduates completed 8 online assessments of IAAs , explicit measures of the IAA constructs , and hazardous drinking ( i.e. , consumption , problems , and risk of alcohol-use disorders) every 3 months over a 21-month period. Retention rates , ordered by follow-up time points , were 90 % , 76 % , 76 % , 77 % , 72 % , 67 % , and 66 % , respectively. Half of the participants were nondrinkers at baseline; 21 % were above clinical cutoffs for hazardous drinking. Drinking-identity and alcohol-excitement associations predicted future alcohol consumption and problems after controlling for previous drinking and explicit measures; drinking identity also predicted future risk of alcohol-use disorder. Relative to the other IAAs , drinking identity predicted alcohol consumption for the longest duration ( i.e. , 21 months). Alcohol-approach associations rarely predicted variance in drinking. IAAs vary in their utility as prospective predictors of college-student hazardous drinking. Drinking identity and , to a lesser extent , alcohol excitement , emerged as robust prospective predictors of hazardous drinking. Intervention and screening efforts could likely benefit from targeting those associations. ( PsycINFO Database Record
