  The study aimed to develop simulation models including intracranial aneurysmal and parent vessel geometries , as well as vascular branches , through 3D printing technology. The simulation models focused on the benefits of aneurysmal treatments and clinical education. This prospective study included 13 consecutive patients who suffered from intracranial aneurysms<disease> confirmed by digital subtraction angiography ( DSA) in the Neurosurgery Department of Shaoxing People 's Hospital. The original 3D-DSA image data were extracted through the picture archiving and communication system and imported into Mimics. After reconstructing and transforming to Binary STL format , the simulation models of the hollow vascular tree were printed using 3D devices. The intracranial aneurysm<disease> 3D printing simulation model was developed based on DSA to assist neurosurgeons in aneurysmal treatments and residency training. Seven neurosurgical residents and 15 standardization training residents received their simulation model training and gave high assessments for the educational course with the follow-up qualitative questionnaire. 3D printed simulation models based on DSA can perfectly reveal target aneurysms<disease> and help neurosurgeons select therapeutic strategies precisely. As an educational tool , the 3D aneurysm<disease> vascular simulation model is useful for training residents.
