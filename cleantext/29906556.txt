  Bergamot essential oil ( BEO) has proven wide evidence of pharmacological antinociceptive effectiveness both in nociceptive and in neuropathic pain models. The antinociceptive properties of BEO for inhalation have not been investigated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the inhalation of BEO on formalin-induced nociceptive response in mice. Male ddY-strain mice ( Japan SLC , Hamamatsu , Japan) of 23-25 g of weight at the time the experiments underwent the formalin test. Twenty Î¼l of formalin ( 2 % in saline) were administered into the plantar surface of the mice hindpaw and the time of licking/biting was observed and recorded at intervals of 5 min. The device for BEO inhalatory delivery consisted in a filter paper disc soaked with known volume of BEO placed on the edge of the cage. Inhalation of BEO exerted antinociceptive activity. In particular , it reduced the formalin-induced licking/biting behaviour in a manner that was dependent on the volume of BEO used in the device for its release and on the time of exposure to the phytocomplex. The results support the use of BEO in aromatherapy for complementary management of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> relief in a stepwise therapeutic programme.
