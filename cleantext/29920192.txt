  To determine the differences in costs and complications in patients with bicondylar tibial plateau ( BTP) fractures treated with 1-stage definitive fixation compared with 2-stage fixation after initial spanning external fixation. Retrospective cohort study. Level 1 Trauma Center. Patients with OTA/AO 41-C ( Schatzker 6) BTP fractures treated with open reduction internal fixation. Definitive treatment with open reduction internal fixation either acutely ( 1 stage) or delayed after initial spanning external fixation ( 2 stage). Wound<disease> healing complications , implant costs , hospital charges , Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS) , reoperation , nonunion and infection. One hundred five patients were identified over a three-year period , of whom 52 met the inclusion criteria. There were 28 patients in the 1-stage group and 24 patients in the 2-stage group. Mean follow-up was 21.8 months , and 87 % of patients had at least 12 months of follow-up. The mean number of days to definitive fixation was 1.2 in the 1-stage group and 7.8 in the 2-stage group. There were no differences between groups with respect to wound healing or any other surgery-related complications. Functional outcomes PROMIS were similar between groups. Mean implant cost in the 2-stage group was $ 10,821 greater than the 1-stage group , mostly because of the costs of external fixation. Median hospital inpatient charges in the 2-stage group exceeded the 1-stage group by more than $ 68,000 for all BTP fractures and by $ 61,000 for isolated BTP fractures. Early single-stage treatment of BTP fractures is cost-effective and is not associated with a higher complication rate than 2-stage treatment in appropriately selected patients. Therapeutic Level III.
