  Marine meiofauna comprises up to 22 phyla. Its morphological identification requires time and taxonomists ' expertise , and molecular tools can make this task faster. We aim to disentangle meiofaunal diversity patterns at Araçá Bay by applying a model selection approach and estimating the effectiveness of metabarcoding ( 18S rDNA) and morphological methods for estimating the response of meiofauna diversity in small-scale interactions with environmental variables. A rarefaction curve indicated that ten samples were sufficient for estimating the total number of meiofauna OTUs in a tidal flat. In both approaches , richness was predicted by mean sand percentage , sediment sorting , and bacteria concentration. Nematode genera composition differed significantly between approaches , the result of taxonomic mismatch in the genetic database. The similarity between the model selected for diversity descriptors , the richness of nematode genera and meiofauna composition emphasized the utility of predictive models for metabarcoding estimates to detect small-scale interactions of these organisms.
