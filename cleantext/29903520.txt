  In patients undergoing atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) ablation , despite uninterrupted oral anticoagulants ( OACs) have been recommended , no consensus has emerged regarding to whether uninterrupted novel oral anticoagulants ( NOACs) are superior to uninterrupted vitamin K antagonists ( VKAs) for the periprocedural antithrombotic management. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of uninterrupted NOACs and uninterrupted VKAs in patients undergoing AF ablation. Databases were searched for articles published up to March 20 , 2018. Only randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) were selected. The data were analyzed with RevMan 5.3 using a fixed-effects method. 6 RCTs and 1903 patients were included. There was no significant difference between NOACs group and VKAs group in incidence of stroke or TIA ( OR = 1.00 , 95 % CI = 0.23-4.40 , P = 1.00) , silent cerebral thromboembolic events ( OR = 1.09 , 95 % CI = 0.67-1.75 , P = 0.74) or minor bleeding ( OR = 1.01 , 95 % CI = 0.78-1.31 , P = 0.93) , which were consistent in subgroup analysis of individual NOAC vs. VKAs group. NOACs treatment was associated with reduced risk of major bleeding as compared with VKAs ( OR = 0.45 , 95 % CI = 0.26-0.81 , P < 0.01). In the subgroup analyses , only the dabigatran group showed significant lower incidence of major bleeding compared to VKAs group. In patients undergoing AF ablation , uninterrupted NOACs is as effective as uninterrupted VKAs treatment , uninterrupted dabigatran ( 150 mg twice daily) may be superior to other uninterrupted OACs strategies.
