  The capillary network is distributed throughout the body , and its reconstruction is induced under various pathophysiological conditions. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression via post-transcriptional mechanisms and are involved in many biological functions including angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that each miRNA of the miR-23 cluster , composed of the miR-23a cluster ( miR-23a ~ 27a ~ 24-2) and miR-23b cluster ( miR-23b ~ 27b ~ 24-2) , regulates angiogenesis in vitro. However , the role of the endothelium-specific miR-23 cluster , located within a single transcription unit , in angiogenesis in vivo has not been elucidated. In the present study , we generated vascular endothelial cell ( EC)- specific miR-23 double knockout mice ( DKO) and demonstrated sprouting angiogenesis under various conditions , including voluntary running exercise , skin wound<disease> healing , and EC sprouting from aorta explants. Here , we demonstrated that EC-specific miR-23 DKO mice were viable and fertile , with no gross abnormalities observed in the pups or adults. The capillary number was increased in the muscles of these DKO mice in response to 2 weeks of voluntary running. Furthermore , we did not observe any abnormalities in skin wound<disease> closure or EC sprouting from aortic ring explants in EC-specific miR-23 DKO mice. Our results suggest that endothelial miR-23 clusters are dispensable for embryonic development and postnatal angiogenesis in vivo.
