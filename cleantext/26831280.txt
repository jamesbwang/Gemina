  Familiarity incrementally improves our ability to identify faces. It has been hypothesized that this improvement reflects the refinement of memory representations which incorporate variation in appearance across encounters. Although it is established that exposure to variation improves face identification accuracy , it is not clear how variation is assimilated into internal face representations. To address this , we used a novel approach to isolate the effect of
