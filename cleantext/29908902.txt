  Recently , recurrent neural networks ( RNNs) have been applied in predicting disease onset risks with Electronic Health Record ( EHR) data. While these models demonstrated promising results on relatively small data sets , the generalizability and transferability of those models and its applicability to different patient populations across hospitals have not been evaluated. In this study , we evaluated an RNN model , RETAIN , over Cerner Health Facts Â® EMR data , for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> onset risk prediction. Our data set included over 150,000 heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients and over 1,000,000 controls from nearly 400 hospitals. Convincingly , RETAIN achieved an AUC of 82 % in comparison to an AUC of 79 % for logistic regression , demonstrating the power of more expressive deep learning models for EHR predictive modeling. The prediction performance fluctuated across different patient groups and varied from hospital to hospital. Also , we trained RETAIN models on individual hospitals and found that the model can be applied to other hospitals with only about 3.6 % of reduction of AUC. Our results demonstrated the capability of RNN for predictive modeling with large and heterogeneous EHR data , and pave the road for future improvements.
