  The immune regulatory enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO-1) suppresses T cell responses and may reduce efficacy of therapies targeting immune checkpoints such as programmed death receptor-1/ programmed death ligand-1 ( PD-1/ PD-L1). Early phase clinical trials combining IDO-1 and PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitors have shown some promise in non-small cell lung cancers ( NSCLCs). However , the coexpression of IDO-1 and PD-L1 has not been thoroughly investigated , and the potential for IDO-1 immunohistochemical expression as a therapeutic biomarker is unknown. One hundred two cases of NSCLC ( 51 adenocarcinomas , 9 adenosquamous carcinomas , and 42 squamous cell carcinomas) were evaluated for IDO-1 and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry. IDO-1 expression was identified in 43 % of NSCLC ( 42 % of adenocarcinomas , 44 % of adenosquamous carcinomas , and 43 % of squamous cell carcinomas). Coexpression with PD-L1 ( â‰¥ 1 %) was common ( 27 % overall; 27 % of adenocarcinomas , 33 % of adenosquamous carcinomas , and 26 % of squamous cell carcinomas). A smaller population of tumors showed isolated PD-L1 ( 25 % overall; 16 % of adenocarcinomas , 44 % of adenosquamous carcinomas , and 33 % of squamous cell carcinomas) or IDO-1 expression ( 15 % overall; 14 % of adenocarcinomas , 11 % of adenosquamous carcinomas , and 17 % of squamous cell carcinomas). In summary , IDO-1 is commonly expressed by NSCLC , and its frequent coexpression with PD-L1 may account for the increased efficacy seen with dual blockade of PD-1/ PD-L1 and IDO in clinical studies. IDO-1 immunohistochemistry may be a useful biomarker for selection of patients who could benefit from dual-agent therapy and should be evaluated in prospective clinical trials using PD-1/ PD-L1 and IDO inhibitors.
