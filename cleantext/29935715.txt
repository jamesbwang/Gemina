  Numerous factors contribute to the outcome and recovery for range cattle affected by blizzard. Consequences and impact on the producer depend on the timing of the storm relative to the herd 's production cycle , access to shelter , duration and intensity of the storm , and post-storm emergency management. Critical planning efforts by the producer include clear animal identification methods , identification of sheltering options , and consideration of animal indemnity and insurance requirements. Including range animals in local and state disaster planning efforts facilitates response and recovery efforts.
