  To describe corneal ectasia in cases of chronic Stevens-Johnson syndrome<disease> ( SJS). Prospective observational study. Setting: Institutional. Fifteen consecutive cases of chronic SJS. Best-corrected distance visual acuity ( BCDVA) , maximum corneal curvature ( Kmax) , anterior elevation , posterior elevation , thinnest pachymetry , and Sotozono severity score. Thirty eyes of 15 patients were included. Corneal tomography using Scheimpflug technology ( Pentacam-HR , Oculus GmbH) was performed. Nine eyes were excluded owing to poor-quality scans. The median age was 26 years. The median time from onset of disease to assessment for corneal ectasia was 7 years. The median BCDVA was 0.8 logMAR units at presentation. The median Sotozono severity score was 11. Corneal ectasia ( Kmax > 48 diopters ( D)) was noted in 76.2 % of eyes. The mean Kmax was 58.37 ± 14.89 D. On Belin/Ambrosio enhanced ectasia display the median front and back elevation was 42 μm ( 10-176 μm) and 267 μm ( 15-2392 μm) , respectively. The mean pachymetry was 377.76 ± 165.05 μm ( 133-448 μm). The point of maximum ectasia was peripheral in 57.1 % , both central and peripheral in 19.1 % , and central in 23.8 % of eyes. On Spearman correlation analysis , deterioration in BCDVA ( R = 0.759 , P < .001) and increase in Kmax ( R = 0.589 , P = .005) was associated with higher disease severity ( Sotozono grading). Corneal ectasia is a common but often missed entity in cases of chronic SJS that may be a cause for poor visual acuity in these cases. All cases of SJS must be evaluated for corneal ectasia , especially when the visual acuity is disproportionate to the disease severity.
