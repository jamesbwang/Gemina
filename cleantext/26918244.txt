  Methods to regulate gene expression programs in bacterial cells are limited by the absence of effective gene activators. To address this challenge , we have developed synthetic bacterial transcriptional activators in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> by linking activation domains to programmable CRISPR-Cas DNA binding domains. Effective gene activation requires target sites situated in a narrow region just upstream of the transcription start site , in sharp contrast to the relatively flexible target site requirements for gene activation in eukaryotic cells. Together with existing tools for CRISPRi gene repression , these bacterial activators enable programmable control over multiple genes with simultaneous activation and repression. Further , the entire gene expression program can be switched on by inducing expression of the CRISPR-Cas system. This work will provide a foundation for engineering synthetic bacterial cellular devices with applications including diagnostics , therapeutics , and industrial biosynthesis.
