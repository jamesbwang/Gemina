  Microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography ( MEEKC) is an electrophoretic methodology based on the separation of compounds by a microemulsionated electrolyte. There are few options for the evaluation of the stability and content of the oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban ( RIV) in pharmaceutical formulations. RIV has low water solubility and undergoes ionization only under restricted pH conditions ( pH < 1 or pH > 13) , thus , hindering the application of free zone capillary electrophoresis as an analytical method. Therefore , the work aimed at developing and validating a stability-indicating MEEKC method for the analysis of RIV in pharmaceutical formulations. Separation was performed in a fused-silica capillary applying a voltage of 30 kV. The microemulsion system consisted of 13 mM tetraborate , pH 9.75 + 1.2 % SDS + 1.0 % ethyl acetate + 2.4 % butanol. The linearity range was 25-150 μg mL-1 , with r = 0.9982. Drug degradations were performed in acid and basic media ( HCl 1 M and NaOH 0.1 M , respectively) , oxidation with 3 % H2O2 , 60 °C temperature and exposure to UV-C radiation. No interferences with RIV or internal standard peaks were detected. Method robustness was accessed through Plackett-Burman experimental design , after evaluation of model validity. Trueness values between 100.49 and 100.68 % were obtained with repeatability. The method developed was found appropriate for quality control of RIV tablets , as a consistent analytical technique that is considered less damaging to the environment due to its low consumption of organic reagents.
