  Disruption in the care of special healthcare needs children may lead to life-threatening situations or preventable secondary conditions. California averages more than 100 earthquakes per week. Subsequent power outages , damage to utility systems , and road damage after an earthquake can have grave consequences for families with parenteral nutrition ( PN)- dependent children. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate that we could improve disaster preparedness of families with PN-dependent children utilizing individualized family education and distribution of personalized disaster survival toolkits. We administered a baseline survey to assess disaster preparedness of our families with PN-dependent children followed by individualized disaster survival toolkit distribution and education. We followed up with these families with phone call surveys at 2 and 4 months. A generalized estimating equation with both logistic and linear regression was used to analyze data over the follow-up period. We found statistically significant improvements in developing a family emergency plan ( P < 0.0001) , having a basic emergency supply kit ( P < 0.0001) , having a completed emergency information form from the child 's provider ( P < 0.0001) , and the confidence level or readiness for a disaster ( P < 0.0001). All participants had extra batteries for PN infusion pumps. Having alternative power sources , such as a generator , did not significantly change over time. Individualized disaster education helped families with PN-dependent children not only to prepare for a possible earthquake , but also to feel more confident in their ability to handle a natural disaster.
