  The alkylation of enolates is one of the backbones of ketone chemistry , yet in practice it suffers from numerous limitations due to problems of regiochemistry ( including O- versus C-alkylation) , multiple alkylations , self-condensation , competing elimination , and incompatibility with many polar groups that have to be protected. Over the years , various solutions have been devised to overcome these difficulties , such as the employment of auxiliary ester or sulfone groups to modify the p K
