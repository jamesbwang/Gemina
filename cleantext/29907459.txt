  There is significant progress in understanding the structure and function of NLRC5 , a member of the nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor family. However , in the context of MHC class I gene expression , the functions of NLRC5 in innate and adaptive immune responses beyond the regulation of MHC class I genes remain controversial and unresolved. In particular , the role of NLRC5 in the kidney is unknown. NLRC5 was significantly upregulated in the kidney from mice with renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. NLRC5 deficient mice significantly ameliorated renal injury as evidenced by decreased serum creatinine levels , improved morphological injuries , and reduced inflammatory responses versus wild type mice. Similar protective effects were also observed in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. Mechanistically , NLRC5 contributed to renal injury by promoting tubular epithelial cell apoptosis and reducing inflammatory responses were , at least in part , associated with the negative regulation of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CEACAM1). To determine the relative contribution of NLRC5 expression by parenchymal cells or leukocytes to renal damage during ischemia/reperfusion injury , we generated bone<disease> marrow chimeric mice. NLRC5 deficient mice engrafted with wild type hematopoietic cells had significantly lower serum creatinine and less tubular damage than wild type mice reconstituted with NLRC5 deficient bone<disease> marrow. This suggests that NLRC5 signaling in renal parenchymal cells plays the dominant role in mediating renal damage. Thus , modulation of the NLRC5-mediated pathway may have important therapeutic implications for patients with acute kidney injury.
