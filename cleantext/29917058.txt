  Frailty is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Underlying mechanisms to explain the connection between frailty and cardiovascular disease are unclear. We sought to examine the association between frailty and arterial stiffness , a precursor of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of community-dwelling Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Omni participants â‰¥ 60 years of age examined in 2005-2008. Frailty was defined primarily according to the Fried physical phenotype definition , which identifies non-frail , pre-frail , and frail individuals. Arterial stiffness was assessed using carotid femoral pulse wave velocity ( CFPWV). Generalized linear regression was used to examine the association between frailty level and CFPWV ( modeled as -1000/ CFPWV in msec/m , then transformed back to the original scale , m/s) , adjusted for age , sex , cohort , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , height , and smoking. Of 2,171 participants ( 55 % women , 91 % white) , 45 % were pre-frail and 7 % frail. Mean ages were 67 , 70 , and 73 years and adjusted CFPWV least squares means were 10.0 ( 95 % CI , 9.9-10.1) , 10.3 ( 10.2-10.5) , and 10.5 m/s ( 10.1-11.0) , P = 0.0002 for non-frail , pre-frail and frail groups respectively. Results were similar using the Rockwood cumulative deficit model of frailty , and in a sensitivity analysis adjusting for prevalent coronary heart disease and diabetes. Pre-frailty and frailty were associated with higher arterial stiffness in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults. Arterial stiffness may help explain the relationship between frailty and cardiovascular disease.
