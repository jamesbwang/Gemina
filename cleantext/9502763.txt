  Nitric oxide , produced by eNOS , plays critical roles in the regulation of vascular function and maintenance. Chronic PI3K signaling has recently been associated with vascular malformations. A well described substrate downstream of PI3K signaling is eNOS. Another critical downstream target of PI3K is the metabolic regulator , mTORc1. The relationship between mTORc1 and eNOS regulation , has not been determined. We generated cells with manipulated PI3K signaling by expressing the activating mutation , PIK3CA
