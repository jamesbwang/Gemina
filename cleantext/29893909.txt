  To evaluate the serum levels of interleukin ( IL) -6 , IL-8 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α , tumor growth factor ( TGF)- β , endothelin , and immunoglobulin ( Ig) E in patients with idiopathic epistaxis<symptom> , compared with healthy control individuals. Serum levels of IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-α , TGF-β , endothelin , and IgE were evaluated in 110 patients with idiopathic epistaxis<symptom> and 100 healthy controls using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) technique. Serum levels of IL-6 ( P < .001) and TGF-β ( P = .001) were significantly increased in patients with idiopathic epistaxis<symptom> , compared with controls. TNF-α serum levels were significantly increased in male patients , compared with female patients ( P = .053). We observed decreased antihistamine levels and increased expression of TGF-β ( P = .02) and TNF-α ( P = .02) , respectively. IL-6 and TGF-β appear to participate in the pathogenesis of idiopathic epistaxis<symptom>. TNF-α may be considered a risk factor for male patients in developing epistaxis<symptom>. Antihistamines may inhibit angiogenesis by decreasing expression of TGF-β and increasing expression of TNF-α.
