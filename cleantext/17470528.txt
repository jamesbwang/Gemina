  The renal clearance of fampridine ( Fampyra ® , or Ampyra ®) significantly exceeds the glomerular filtration rate , suggesting active renal secretion is likely the major elimination pathway. The goal of this study was to identify the renal transporters that are involved in the renal active secretion , and elucidate the active renal secretion mechanism of fampridine. The uptake of fampridine to HEK-293 cells overexpressing human OCT2 , MATE1 or MATE2K was determined in the absence and presence of Cimetidine , the prototypical inhibitor of the transporters. The inhibition potential of fampridine on the renal transporters was evaluated by determining the uptake of TEA and Metformin , the probe substrates of the transporters of OCT2 and MATEs , respectively , in the absence or presence of fampridine. Significant time- and concentration-dependent uptake of fampridine by human OCT2 was observed. The K The studies indicated fampridine is a substrate and inhibitor of OCT2 , but not MATE1 or MATE2K. Results from the study suggested the active renal secretion of fampridine is mediated by human OCT2 but not MATE1 or MATE2K. To our knowledge , fampridine is the first reported substrate specific to OCT2 but not to MATE1 or MATE2K.
