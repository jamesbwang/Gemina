  Palbociclib , ribociclib , and abemaciclib have been investigated in combination with aromatase inhibitors as first-line therapy for metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer ( PALOMA-2 , MONALEESA-2 and MONALEESA-7 , MONARCH-3 trials , respectively); pivotal trials led to absolute median progression-free survival ( PFS) gain of about 15 months. We aimed to estimate , for each trial , the statistical power to demonstrate a significant gain in overall survival ( OS). Power was calculated with Freedman 's formula. Given the allocation ratio and the number of events , power was computed as a function of hazard ratio. We focused on four specific hazard ratio values ( 0.94 , 0.89 , 0.81 , and 0.77) , which are estimated to correspond to absolute 3 , 6 , 12 , and 15 months gain in OS , respectively. For these calculations , the type I error rate was stated at 5 % with a two-sided test , and we assumed that the risk of death was constant over time. PALOMA-2 and MONALEESA trials have an almost similar power despite different allocation ratios , while MONARCH-3 has a more limited power. Overall , the power of the four trials to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in OS is less than 70 % if the prolongation in median OS is â‰¤ 12 months , whatever the OS data maturity. This analysis shows that OS results are jeopardized by limited powers , and a meta-analysis might be required to demonstrate OS benefit. Conversely , if a significant OS improvement is observed in some but not at all trials , this discrepancy might be more attributable to chance than to a truly different drug efficacy.
