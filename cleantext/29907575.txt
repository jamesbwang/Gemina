  Debate continues about the optimal anesthetic management for patients undergoing endovascular treatment ( ET) of acute ischemic stroke due to emergent large vessel occlusion. To compare , using current evidence , the clinical outcomes and procedural characteristics among patients undergoing general anesthesia ( GA) and local or monitored anesthesia ( non-GA). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all available studies that involved the use of stent retrievers for ET ( stentriever group). Additionally , we included studies that were published in 2015 and later , and compared the clinical outcomes among the studies using stentrievers or no stentrievers ( pre-stentriever group). Outcome variables included functional independence ( FI; modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-2) , symptomatic hemorrhage<symptom> , mortality , procedure duration , and vascular and respiratory complications. We calculated pooled odds ratios and 95 % CIs using random-effects models. Sixteen studies ( three randomized controlled clinical trials ( RCTs) and 13 non-randomized studies) were identified comprising 5836 patients. Although non-GA was associated with higher odds of 3-month FI ( OR = 1.57; 95 % CI 1.17 to 2.10; P = 0.003) and lower odds of 3-month mortality ( OR = 0.62; 95 % CI 0.47 to 0.82; P = 0.0006 , substantial heterogeneity was noted across included trials. Sensitivity analyses of RCTs showed that non-GA was inversely associated with FI ( OR = 0.55; 95 % CI 0.34 to 0.89; P = 0.01; I Our updated meta-analysis demonstrates favorable results with non-GA , probably owing to inclusion of non-randomized studies. Recent single-center RCTs indicate that GA is associated with higher odds of FI at 3 months , while other outcomes are similar between the two groups.
