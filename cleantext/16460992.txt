  In this paper , we systematically reviewed twenty-one factors that have been shown to either vary with or influence performance on working memory ( WM) tasks. Specifically , we review previous work on the influence of intelligence , gender , age , personality , mental illnesses/medical conditions , dieting , craving , stress/anxiety , emotion/motivation , stereotype threat , temperature , mindfulness training , practice , bilingualism , musical training , altitude/hypoxia , sleep , exercise , diet , psychoactive substances , and brain stimulation on WM performance. In addition to a review of the literature , we suggest several frameworks for classifying these factors , identify shared mechanisms between several variables , and suggest areas requiring further investigation. This review critically examines the breadth of research investigating WM while synthesizing the results across related subfields in psychology.
