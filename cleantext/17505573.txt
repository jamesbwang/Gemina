  Current available treatments for Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication are chosen according to local clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance prevalence. The aim of this study was to estimate , by means of molecular methods , both clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance in gastric mucosa from patients infected with H.pylori. A total of 191 DNA samples were analyzed. DNA was purified from gastric mucosa obtained from patients who underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at an university hospital from Santiago , Chile , between 2011 and 2014. H.pylori was detected by real-time PCR. A 5 ` exonuclease assay was developed to detect A2142G and A2143G mutations among H.pylori-positive samples. rdxA gene was sequenced in samples harboring A2142G and A2143G mutations in order to detect mutations that potentially confer dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance. Ninety-three ( 93) out of 191 DNA samples obtained from gastric mucosa were H.pylori-positive ( 48.7 %). Clarithromycin-resistance was detected in 29 samples ( 31.2 % ( 95 % CI 22.0-41.6 %)). The sequencing of rdxA gene revealed that two samples harbored truncating mutations in rdxA , one sample had an in-frame deletion , and 11 had amino acid changes that likely cause metronidazole resistance. We estimated a prevalence of clarithomycin-resistance of 31.8 % in Santiago , Chile. Three of them harbor inactivating mutations in rdxA and 11 had missense mutations likely conferring metronidazole resistance. Our results require further confirmation. Nevertheless , they are significant as an initial approximation in re-evaluating the guidelines for H.pylori eradication currently used in Chile.
