  Low-cost , high-energy-density , and highly efficient devices for energy storage have long been desired in our society. Herein , a novel high-energy-density hybrid sodium-air cell was fabricated successfully on the basis of acidic catholytes. Such a hybrid sodium-air cell possess a high theoretical voltage of 3.94 V , capacity of 1121 mAh g
