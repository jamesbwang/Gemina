  The effects of intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR) extend well into postnatal life. IUGR is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes , which often leads to greater medication usage. Many medications require hepatic metabolism for activation or clearance , but hepatic function may be altered in IUGR fetuses. Using a sheep model of IUGR , we determined the impact of IUGR on hepatic drug metabolism and drug transporter expression , both important mediators of fetal drug exposure , in late gestation and in neonatal life. In the late gestation fetus , IUGR decreased the gene expression of uptake drug transporter OATPC and increased P-glycoprotein protein expression in the liver , but there was no change in the activity of the drug metabolising enzymes CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. In contrast , at 3 weeks of age , CYP3A4 activity was reduced in the livers of lambs born with low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( LBW) , indicating that LBW results in changes to drug metabolising capacity in neonatal life. Together , these results suggest that IUGR may reduce hepatic drug metabolism in fetal and neonatal life through different mechanisms.
