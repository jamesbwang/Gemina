  Pelvic floor dysfunction ( PFD) is a clinical entity that is predominantly common in females. Determining the exact underlying cause of PFD can be difficult , and making surgical intervention may be challenging. The PFD can affect the quality of life of the patient by causingstress urinary incontinence ( SUI) , pelvic organ prolapse ( POP) or a combination of both. There are well-defined surgical treatment options for PFD , with minimally invasive approaches and novel techniques are recently being introduced. We here evaluated management options in patients presenting with SUI and POP focussing on novel and minimally invasive treatment modalities and their implications on future uro-gynaecological practice. The current literature was researched for relevant articles in Medline and EMBASE databases by using the following keywords: pelvic floor dysfunction , minimally invasive procedures , stress urinary incontinence , pelvic organ prolapse and novel techniques. The review of the traditional treatment options for both SUI and POP are beyond the scope of this review. There has been continuing evolution and development in laparoscopic and robotic surgery to treat PFD. These minimally invasive techniques will soon substitute open procedures. Alternative novel treatment modalities have also been developed from new human compatible materials and are emerging as successful treatments for SUI. We here presented the findings of a review of the contemporary literature relating to the development of these various treatment options , and their implications for future surgical practice in this field of uro-gynaecology.
