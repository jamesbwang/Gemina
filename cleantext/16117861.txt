  The relation has not been reported consistently between the PON1 Q192R polymorphism and coronary heart disease ( CHD). To clarify the discrepancy , we performed the present meta-analysis to evaluate the association between the PON1 gene Q192R polymorphism and CHD risk in Chinese population. We conducted a comprehensive search of the PubMed , EMBASE , and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for all available case-control studies. Two reviewers independently selected studies. Data were analyzed by STATA software package v 12.0. Thirteen studies investigating the association between the PON1 Q192R polymorphism and risk of CHD were selected in this meta-analysis with 4353 cases and 4882 controls. The association between the PON1 Q192R polymorphism and CHD is statistically significant under the recessive genetic model ( R/R vs Q/R + Q/Q , odds ratio ( OR) = 1.111 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.017-1.214). We observed no statistical association between PON1 Q192R polymorphism and risk of CHD under allele model ( R vs Q , OR = 1.087 , 95 % CI = 0.976-1.209) , homozygous model ( RR vs QQ , OR = 1.192 , 95 % CI = 0.949-1.496) , and dominant genetic model ( Q/R + R/R vs Q/Q , OR = 1.127 , 95 % CI = 0.938-1.354). This meta-analysis suggests that the PON1 Q192R polymorphism has a weak association with CHD risk in Chinese.
