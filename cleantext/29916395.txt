  In this paper , a versatile multi-body dynamic algorithm is developed to integrate an incompressible fluid flow with a bio-inspired multibody dynamic system. Of particular interest to the biomimetic application , the algorithm is developed via four properly selected benchmark verifications. The present tool has shown its powerful capability for solving a variety of biomechanics fish swimming problems , including self-propelled multiple degrees of freedom with a rigid undulatory body , multiple deformable fins and an integrated system with both undulatory fish body and flexible fins. The established tool has paved the way for future investigation on more complex bio-inspired robots and live fish , for either propulsion or manoeuvring purposes.
