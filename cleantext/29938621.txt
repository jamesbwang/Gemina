  Migraine is a disabling neuroinflammatory condition characterized by increasing the levels of interleukin ( IL) -6 , a proinflammatory cytokine and C-reactive protein ( CRP) which considered as a vascular inflammatory mediator , disrupting the integrity of blood-brain barrier and contributing to neurogenic inflammation<symptom> , and disease progression. Curcumin and ω-3 fatty acids can exert neuroprotective effects through modulation of IL-6 gene expression and CRP levels. The aim of present study is the evaluation of combined effects of ω-3 fatty acids and nano-curcumin supplementation on IL-6 gene expression and serum level and hs-CRP levels in migraine patients. Eighty episodic migraine patients enrolled in the trial and were divided into four groups as 1) combination of ω-3 fatty acids ( 2500 mg) plus nano-curcumin ( 80 mg) , 2) ω-3 ( 2500 mg) , 3) nano-curcumin ( 80 mg) , and 4) the control ( ω-3 and nano-cucumin placebo included oral paraffin oil) over a two-month period. At the beginning and the end of the study , the expression of IL-6 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and IL-6 and hs-CRP serum levels were measured , using a real-time PCR and ELISA methods , respectively. The results showed that both of ω-3 and nano-curcumin down-regulated IL-6 mRAN and significantly decreased the serum concentration. hs-CRP serum levels significantly decrease in combination and nano-curcumin within groups ( P < 0.05). An additive greater reduction of IL-6 and hs-CRP was observed in the combination group suggested a possible synergetic relation. It seems that , ω-3 fatty acids and curcumin supplementation can be considered a new promising target in migraine prevention.
