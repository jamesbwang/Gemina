  The study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of cystatin C in ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI) patients who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). A retrospective study was conducted on 664 STEMI patients from 7 centers who were treated with elective PCI. These patients were divided into 3 groups according their admission cystatin C levels as < 0.84 , 0.84-1.03 and ≥ 1.04 mg/L. The all-cause mortalities and the composite endpoints , including mortality , reinfarction , rehospitalization for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and angina or repeat target vessel revascularization were observed for up to 5 years. As cystatin C levels from low to high , all-cause mortalities were progressively increased 0.9 % , 3.7 % and 9.5 % ( P < 0.001) , as well as the composite endpoints , 11.1 % , 21.7 % and 40.7 % , respectively ( P < 0.001). When patients had the level of cystatin C ≥ 0.84 mg/L , their risks of composite endpoints increased 2- to 3-fold of those with < 0.84 mg/L , with the adjusted hazard ratio of 2.096 ( 95 % CI: 1.047-4.196 , P = 0.037) and 3.608 ( 95 % CI: 1.939-6.716 , P < 0.001) , respectively. Increased cystatin C levels may be associated with enhanced risks of composite endpoints in patients with STEMI undergoing elective PCI.
