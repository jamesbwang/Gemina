  Men who had sex with men ( MSM) living with HIV<pathogen> are at higher risk of developing sexual transmitted diseases. This study reports two years incidence rate and prevalence of HCV in a cohort of HIV<pathogen> positive MSM. MSM HIV-positive outpatients negative to HCV-Ab at first observation entered a Kaplan-Meier model in order to assess the HCV infection incidence rate. Prevalence analysis was performed with MSM HIV-positive that were on follow-up at 2016. An MSM population HIV-negative served as control. 421 patients entered the incidence analysis. The incidence rate of HCV infection among MSM-HIV people was 0.44 per 100 patients-years ( 19 events). 40 out of 442 ( 9 %) patients were HCV-positive ( prevalence analysis); they were mostly genotype 1a and 3 with APRI score < 0.7 ( 87.5 %). Univariate analysis between MSM HIV-positive patients and MSM HIV-negative showed significant differences in the prevalence rate ( 9.0 % vs 0.6 % , P < 0.001) and median age ( 39 vs 47 , P < 0.001). Incidence and prevalence rate of HCV amongst MSM HIV-positive patients is higher than in other settings. Annual HCV-Ab screening for MSM HIV-positive patients should be enforced and early treatment of HCV recommended.
