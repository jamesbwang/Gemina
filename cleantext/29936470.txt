  We reported that epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor re-administration ( TKI-R) might be salvage therapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer after recovery from EGFR-TKI-induced interstitial lung disease ( ILD). Here we retrospectively evaluated whether chemotherapy re-administration ( CT-R) was effective in patients after chemotherapy-induced ILD. After providing their informed consent due to the risk of severe ILD , five patients received CT-R and six received TKI-R with oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg prednisolone. The overall survival ( OS) from the occurrence of drug-induced ILD was shorter in CT-R cases than that in TKI-R cases ( 7.3 months vs. 25.4 months , p = 0.003). The median duration of OS , however , was 7.3 months in cases with CT-R and 1.9 months in cases without CT-R. Multivariate analysis showed that CT-R as well as TKI-R tended to reduce the risk of mortality. CT-R might be salvage therapy in such patients , although the benefit of CT-R was smaller than that of TKI-R.
