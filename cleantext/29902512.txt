  Genotyping arrays characterize genome-wide SNPs for a study cohort and were the primary technology behind genome wide association studies over the last decade. The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) is one of the largest cancer consortium studies , and it collected genotyping data for all of its participants. Using TCGA SNP data genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array from 12,064 samples , we conducted a comprehensive comparisons across DNA sources ( tumor tissue , normal tissue , and blood) and sample storage protocols ( formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE) vs. freshly frozen ( FF)) , examining genotypes , transition/transversion ratios , and mutation catalogues. During the analysis , we made important observations in relevance to the data quality issues. SNP concordance was excellent between blood and normal tissues , and slightly lower between blood and tumor tissue due to potential somatic mutations in the tumors. The observed poor SNP concordance between FFPE and FF samples suggested a batch effect. The transition/transversion ratio , a metric commonly used for quality control purpose in exome sequencing projects , appeared less applicable for genotyping array data due to the whole-genome coverage built into the array design. Moreover , there were substantially more loss of heterozygosity events than gain of heterozygosity when comparing tumors relative to normal tissues and blood. This might be a consequence of extensive copy number deletions in tumors. In summary , our thorough evaluation calls for more adequate quality control practices and provides guidelines for improved application of TCGA genotyping data.
