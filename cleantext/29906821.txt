  We have investigated the nonthermal effect of 10 GHz/22 dBm microwave radiation on hen egg-white lysozyme ( HEWL) over different irradiation times , ranging from 2 min to 1 h. To ensure a control over the radiation parameters , a pair of microwave rectangular waveguides is used to irradiate the samples. Optical spectroscopic measurements , which include UV-visible absorption spectroscopy , Raman spectroscopy , and far UV CD spectroscopy , reveal the exposure of the buried tryptophan ( Trp) residues of the native molecule between 15 and 30 min of radiation. The higher duration of the perturbation leads to a compact structure of the protein and Trp residues are buried again. Interestingly , we do not find any change in the secondary structure of the protein even for 1 h duration of radiation. The relaxation dynamics of the irradiated molecules also has been discussed. We have shown that the molecules relax to their native configuration in 7-8 h after the radiation field is turned off. The structural rearrangement over the above timescale has further been probed by a model calculation , based on a modified Langevin equation. Our coarse-grained simulation approach utilizes the mean of atomic positions and net atomic charge of each amino acid of native HEWL to mimic the initial conformation of the molecule. The modified positions of the residues are then calculated for the given force fields. The simulation results reveal the nonmonotonous change in overall size of the molecule , as observed experimentally. The radiation parameters used in our experiments are very similar to those of some of the electronic devices we often come across. Thus , we believe that the results of our studies on a simple protein structure may help us in understanding the effect of radiation on complex biological systems as well.
