  eHealth solutions are increasingly being applied to deliver interventions for promoting an active lifestyle in the general population but also in older people. Objective assessment of daily physical activity ( PA) is essential to accurately and reliably evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions. This review presents an overview of eHealth interventions that focus on promoting PA in community-dwelling older people , and discusses the methods used to objectively assess PA , and the effectiveness of the eHealth interventions in increasing PA.. The twelve eHealth intervention studies that met our inclusion criteria used a variety of digital solutions , ranging from solely the use of an accelerometer or text messages , to interactive websites with access to ( animated) coaches and peer support. Besides evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention on objectively assessed PA , all interventions also included continuous self-monitoring of PA as part of the intervention. Procedures for the collection and analysis of PA data varied across studies; five studies used pedometers to objectively assess PA and seven used tri-axial accelerometers. Main reported outcomes were daily step counts and minutes spent on PA.. The current evidence seems to point to a positive short-term effect of increased PA ( i.e. right after administering the intervention) , but evidence for long-term effects is lacking. Many studies were underpowered to detect any intervention effects , and therefore larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to provide evidence on sustaining the PA increases that follow eHealth interventions in older people.
