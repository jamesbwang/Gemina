  In normal pregnancy , villous cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast do not express HLA Class I and Class II molecules , while invasive extravillous trophoblast only express class I HLA-C and the atypical class Ib antigens , HLA-G ,- E and- F. Inadequate maternal tolerance of invasive trophoblast has been proposed as a possible immunologic trigger of poor trophoblast invasion and subsequent occurrence of pre-eclampsia. This study aimed to investigate possible aberrant expression of class II HLA-DR on placentae and syncytiotrophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles ( STEVs) , obtained by dual placental perfusion , from pre-eclampsia ( n = 23) and normal pregnant ( n = 14) women. Here we demonstrate that HLA-DR can be detected in syncytiotrophoblast from a significant proportion of pre-eclampsia but not control placentae. HLA-DR was also observed , by flow cytometry , on STEVs and associated with placental alkaline phosphatase to validate their placental origin. HLA-DR positive syncytiotrophoblast was detected in placental biopsies from pre-eclampsia but not normal control cases , using immunohistochemistry. The HLA may be fetal or maternal origin. In the latter case a possible mechanism of acquisition is trogocytosis.
