  To determine the incidence and pattern of facial fracture in children of age 0-16 years of age. Patients with trauma reporting to department of paediatric and preventive dentistry and department of oral & maxillofacial surgery from January 2011 to December 2011 were selected for the present study. The records of patients treated for maxillofacial injuries were retrospectively retrieved and analyzed for prevalence , pattern , etiology , and management of maxillofacial trauma. The data collected were subjected to statistically analysis. SPSS software version 16.0 was used for the data analysis. Total 5049 patients were screened and fifty one was reported to have facial injury. The incidence of facial trauma was 1.01 % for the present study. The age wise distribution of the fracture amongst groups ( I , II and III) were found 17.65 % , 54.9 % and 27.45 % respectively. The sex-wise distribution of facial fracture was reported twice in male than females. The mandibular fracture was found the most common fracture ( 0.59 %) followed by dento alveolar ( 0.30 %) and midface ( 0.12 %) fractures. Most of the mandibular fractures were found in the para symphysis region. Compound fractures seem to be commonest in the mandible. The fall was the predominant cause for most of the facial fractures in children followed by road traffic accident. The pattern of facial injury is influenced by the age and the growth of facial skeleton.
