  The recent identification and development of RNA-guided enzymes for programmable cleavage of target nucleic acids offers exciting possibilities for both therapeutic and biotechnological applications. However , critical challenges such as expensive guide RNAs and inability to predict the efficiency of target recognition , especially for highly-structured RNAs , remain to be addressed. Here , we introduce a programmable RNA restriction enzyme , based on a budding yeast Argonaute ( AGO) , programmed with cost-effective 23-nucleotide ( nt) single-stranded DNAs as guides. DNA guides offer the advantage that diverse sequences can be easily designed and purchased , enabling high-throughput screening to identify optimal recognition sites in the target RNA. Using this DNA-induced slicing complex ( DISC) programmed with 11 different guide DNAs designed to span the sequence , sites of cleavage were identified in the 352-nt human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> type 1 5 '- untranslated region. This assay , coupled with primer extension and capillary electrophoresis , allows detection and relative quantification of all DISC-cleavage sites simultaneously in a single reaction. Comparison between DISC cleavage and RNase H cleavage reveals that DISC not only cleaves solvent-exposed sites , but also sites that become more accessible upon DISC binding. This study demonstrates the advantages of the DISC system for programmable cleavage of highly-structured , functional RNAs.
