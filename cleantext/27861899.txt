  The pathological cascade leading from primary storage to neural cell dysfunction and death in metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD) has been poorly elucidated in human-derived neural cell systems. In the present study , we have modeled the progression of pathological events during the differentiation of patient-specific iPSCs to neuroepithelial progenitor cells ( iPSC-NPCs) and mature neurons , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes at the morphological , molecular , and biochemical level. We showed significant sulfatide accumulation and altered sulfatide composition during the differentiation of MLD iPSC-NPCs into neuronal and glial cells. Changes in sulfatide levels and composition were accompanied by the expansion of the lysosomal compartment , oxidative stress , and apoptosis. The neuronal and glial differentiation capacity of MLD iPSC-NPCs was significantly impaired. We showed delayed appearance and/or reduced levels of oligodendroglial and astroglial markers as well as reduced number of neurons and disorganized neuronal network. Restoration of a functional Arylsulfatase A ( ARSA) enzyme in MLD cells using lentiviral-mediated gene transfer normalized sulfatide levels and composition , globally rescuing the pathological phenotype. Our study points to MLD iPSC-derived neural progeny as a useful in vitro model to assess the impact of ARSA deficiency along NPC differentiation into neurons and glial cells. In addition , iPSC-derived neural cultures allowed testing the impact of ARSA reconstitution/overexpression on disease correction and , importantly , on the biology and functional features of human NPCs , with important therapeutic implications.
