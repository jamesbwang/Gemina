  Sluggish kinetics and thermodynamic unfavorability restrict electrocatalysis for energy storage and conversion reactions such as oxygen reduction/evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein , we report the synthesis and electrochemical performance of novel core-shell nanoparticles@porous carbon microspheres. A unique core-shell architecture of dual-phase FeCo-based nanoparticles@heteroatom-doped carbon microspheres ( FeCo @C MS) has been prepared via a two-step carbonization process from a reactive multifunctional core-double shell template. With the advantages of heterogeneous composition and architectural structure , the obtained FeCo @C MS exhibits excellent performances for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) , which are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst. As an excellent cathode catalyst of the Zn-air battery ( ZAB) , FeCo @C MS exhibits high discharge voltage of 1.27 V , high specific capacity of 503 mA h gZn-1 , an energy density of 639 W h kgZn-1 , and better cycling durability than the battery having a mixture of 20 wt % Pt/C and RuO2. This approach provides a new way to design structures with controlled morphology and excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic activity.
