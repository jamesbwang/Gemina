  Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterised by loss of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals , ultimately resulting in insulin deficiency and hyperglycaemia. T1D is most common among children and young adults , and the incidence is on the rise across the world. The aetiology of T1D is hypothesized to involve genetic and environmental factors that result in the T-cell mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells. There is a strong genetic risk to T1D; with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) identifying over 60 susceptibility regions within the human genome which are marked by single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs). Here , we review what is currently known about the genetics of T1D. We argue that advancing our understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of T1D will require the integration of genome biology ( omics-data) with GWAS data , thereby making it possible to elucidate the putative gene regulatory networks modulated by disease-associated SNPs. This approach has a potential to revolutionize clinical management of T1D in an era of precision medicine.
