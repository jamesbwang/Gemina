  Substrate-integrated microelectrode arrays ( MEAs) are non-invasive platforms for recording supra-threshold signals , i.e. action potentials or spikes , from a variety of cultured electrically active cells , and are useful for pharmacological and toxicological studies. However , the MEA substrate , which is often fabricated using semiconductor processing technology , presents some challenges to the user. Specifically , the electrode encapsulation , which may consist of a variety of inorganic and organic materials , requires a specific substrate preparation protocol to optimize cell adhesion to the surface. Often , these protocols differ from and are more complex than traditional protocols for in vitro cell culture in polystyrene petri dishes. Here , we describe the fabrication of an MEA with indium tin oxide microelectrodes and a patterned polystyrene electrode encapsulation. We demonstrate the electrochemical stability of the electrodes and encapsulation , and show viable cell culture and in vitro recordings.
