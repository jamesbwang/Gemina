  Is maltreatment during childhood ( MC) , e.g. sexual abuse , physical abuse , emotional abuse and neglect , associated with diagnosis of endometriosis? Childhood sexual abuse , emotional abuse/neglect and inconsistency experiences were associated with the diagnosis of endometriosis while no such association was found for physical abuse/neglect and other forms of maltreatment. Symptoms of endometriosis such as chronic pelvic pain , fatigue<symptom> and depression<symptom> , are correlated with MC , as are immune reactions linked to endometriosis. These factors support a case for a potential role of MC in the development of endometriosis. The study was designed as a multicentre retrospective case-control study. Women with a diagnosis of endometriosis were matched to control women from the same clinic/doctor 's office with regard to age ( Â± 3 years) and ethnic background. A total of 421 matched pairs were included in the study. Women with endometriosis and control women were recruited in university hospitals , district hospitals , and doctors ' offices in Germany , Switzerland and Austria. A German-language version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire ( CTQ) was used to evaluate MC. Diagnosis of endometriosis was confirmed histologically and classified according to ASRM criteria. Women with endometriosis reported significantly more often than control women a history of sexual abuse ( 20 %/ 14 % , P = 0.0197) , emotional abuse ( 44 %/ 28 % , P < 0.0001) , emotional neglect ( 50 %/ 42 % , P = 0.0123) and inconsistency experiences ( 53 %/ 41 % , P = 0.0007). No statistically significant differences could be demonstrated for physical abuse/neglect ( 31 %/ 26 % , P = 0.1738). Combinations of different abuse/neglect experiences were described significantly more often in women with endometriosis. Frequencies of other MC , i.e. violence against the mother ( 8 %/ 7 % , P = 0.8222) , drug abuse in the family ( 5 %/ 3 % , P = 0.0943) , mentally handicapped family members ( 1 %/ 1 % , P = 0.7271) , suicidal intentions in the family ( 6 %/ 4 % , P = 0.2879) and family members in prison ( 1 %/ 1 % , P = 0.1597) were not statistically different in women with endometriosis and control women. Some control women might present asymptomatic endometriosis , which would lead to underestimation of our findings. The exclusion of pregnant women may have biased the results. Statistical power for sub-analyses of physical abuse/neglect and sexual abuse was limited. A link to MC needs to be considered in women with endometriosis. As there are effective strategies to avoid long-term consequences of MC , healthcare professionals should inquire about such experiences in order to be able to provide treatment for the consequences as early as possible.
