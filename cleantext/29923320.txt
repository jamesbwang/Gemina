  Vitiligo is a pigmentation disorder of autoimmune aetiology. Polymorphisms in beta-defensin genes have been linked to a predisposition to some autoimmune disorders. To evaluate the role of polymorphisms in DEFB1 , the gene encoding for human beta-defensin ( HBD) -1 and its 5 ' untranslated region in nonsegmental vitiligo. In total , 354 participants ( 171 patients with non-segmental vitiligo and 183 age and sex-matched healthy controls ( HCs)) , were genotyped by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP) method. For 80 of these individuals ( 40 patients and -40 HCs) serum HBD-1 was also measured by ELISA. The -44 G allele , CG genotype and GGG haplotype increased the risk for vitiligo ( P < 0.02 in all cases) , whereas the -20 AA genotype seems to be protective ( P = 0.04). Serum HBD-1 levels were lower in patients with vitiligo than in HCs ( P < 0.01) , as well as in patients with active vitiligo compared with those with stable vitiligo and with HCs ( P < 0.05 in both cases) , CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HBD-1 and its gene polymorphisms may modulate vitiligo susceptibility and/or disease activity. This is the first report , to our knowledge , of the association of serum HBD-1 levels and DEFB1 gene polymorphisms with vitiligo.
