  An efficient protocol for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of new dibenzo ( b , f) ( 1,4)- oxazepine-fused 1,2-dihydropyridines ( DHPs) has been described under metal-free conditions. This reaction proceeds through proline-catalyzed direct Mannich/cyclization between seven-membered dibenzo ( b , f) ( 1,4)- oxazepine-imines and aqueous glutaraldehyde , followed by IBX-mediated site-selective dehydrogenative oxidation in one-pot operation with high yields ( up to 92 %) and excellent enantioselectivity ( up to > 99:1 er).
