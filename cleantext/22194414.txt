  Cross-polarization conversion plays an important role in visible light manipulation. Metasurface with asymmetric structure can be used to achieve polarization conversion of linearly polarized light. Based on this , we design a quasi-periodic dendritic metasurface model composed of asymmetric dendritic cells. The simulation indicates that the asymmetric dendritic structure can vertically rotate the polarization direction of the linear polarization wave in visible light. Silver dendritic cell-cluster metasurface samples were prepared by the bottom-up electrochemical deposition. It experimentally proved that they could realize the cross- polarization conversion in visible light. Cross-polarized propagating light is deflected into anomalous refraction channels. Dendritic cell-cluster metasurface with asymmetric quasi-periodic structure conveys significance in cross-polarization conversion research and features extensive practical application prospect and development potential.
