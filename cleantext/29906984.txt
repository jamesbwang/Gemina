  The cellular cortex , which is a highly viscous thin cytoplasmic layer just below the cell membrane , controls the cell 's mechanical properties , which can be characterized by a hydrodynamic length scale ℓ. Cells actively regulate ℓ via the activity of force-generating molecules , such as myosin II. Here we develop a general theory for such systems through a coarse-grained hydrodynamic approach including activity in the static description of the system providing an experimentally accessible parameter and elucidate the detailed mechanism of how a living system can actively self-regulate its hydrodynamic length scale , controlling the rigidity of the system. Remarkably , we find that ℓ , as a function of activity , behaves universally and roughly inversely proportional to the activity of the system. Our theory rationalizes a number of experimental findings on diverse systems , and comparison of our theory with existing experimental data shows good agreement.
