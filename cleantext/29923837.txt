  The accuracy of stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT) in the liver is limited by tumor motion. Selection of the most suitable motion mitigation strategy requires good understanding of the geometric and dosimetric consequences. This study compares the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of actually delivered respiratory gated SBRT treatments for 15 patients with liver tumors with three simulated alternative motion adaptation strategies. The simulated alternatives are MLC tracking , baseline shift adaptation by inter-field couch corrections and no intrafraction motion adaptation. The patients received electromagnetic transponder-guided respiratory gated IMRT or conformal treatments in three fractions with a 3-4 mm gating window around the full exhale position. The CTV-PTV margin was 5 mm axially and 7-10 mm cranio-caudally. The CTV and PTV were covered with 95 % and 67 % of the prescribed mean CTV dose , respectively. The time-resolved target position error during treatments with the four investigated motion adaptation strategies was used to calculate motion margins and the motion-induced reduction in CTV D
