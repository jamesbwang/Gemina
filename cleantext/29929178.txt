  The aim of this research was to investigate the occurrence of Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> in fish and fish processing plant and to determine their transmission , virulence and antibiotic resistance. L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> was isolated according to the ISO 11290-1. The identification of L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> was confirmed by multiplex PCR method. Genetic similarity of L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> strains was determined with the Pulsed-Filed Gene Electrophoresis ( PFGE) method. The multiplex PCR was used for identification of L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> serogroups and detection of selected virulence genes ( actA , fbpA , hlyA , iap , inlA , inlB , mpl , plcA , plcB , prfA). The L. monocytogens isolates susceptibility to penicillin , ampicillin , meropenem , erythromycin , trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was evaluated with disc diffusion method according to EUCAST v. 7.1. The presence of 237 L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> isolates ( before genetic similarity assessment) in 614 examined samples was confirmed. After strain differentiation by PFGE techniques the presence of 161 genetically different strains were confirmed. The genetic similarity of the examined isolates suggested that the source of the L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> strains were fishes originating from farms. All tested strains possessed all detected virulence genes. Among examined strains , the most ( 26 , 38.6 %) belonged to the group 1/2a<pathogen>- 3a. The most of tested strains were resistant to erythromycin ( 47.1 %) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( 47.1 %).
