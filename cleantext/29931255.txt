  The purpose of this study was to identify the extent to which 7 measures of glottal area timing and regularity differ between older adults with and without age-related dysphonia<symptom> ( ARD). Laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy was completed at 4,000 frames per second for 42 adults aged 70 years and older ( ARD: 9 female , 5 male; control group: 15 female , 13 male). Relative glottal gap , open quotient , speed index , maximum area declination rate , harmonics-to-noise ratio , harmonic richness factor , and standard deviation of fundamental frequency were measured from a 0.5-s segment of the glottal area waveform. Eta squared ( η2) was computed to estimate group effect. Small effect sizes ( η2 = .18-.35) were present for relative glottal gap , open quotient , maximum area declination rate , harmonic richness factor , and standard deviation of fundamental frequency. Speed index and glottal harmonics-to-noise ratio did not explain group membership ( η2 = .001 and .05 , respectively). These findings provide evidence that vocal fold vibration in ARD is different than in normal aging , whereas the overlap in values for every measure is consistent with the concept that normal aging and ARD exist as a continuum of health and disease.
