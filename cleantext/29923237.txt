  1D nanowires of all-inorganic lead halide perovskites represent a good architecture for the development of polarization-sensitive optoelectronic devices due to their high absorption efficient , emission yield , and dielectric constants. However , among as-fabricated perovskite nanowires with the lateral dimensions of hundreds nanometers so far , the optical anisotropy is hindered and rarely explored owing to the invalidating of electrostatic dielectric mismatch in the physical dimensions. Here , well-aligned CsPbBr
