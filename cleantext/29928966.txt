  Guajadial , one of natural dialdehyde meroterpenoids , demonstrated significant antineoplasmic activity. The present research was to investigate the inhibitory effects of guajadial by using two NSCLC cells ( A549 and H1650) proliferation and migration. Western blotting was employed to explore the underlying mechanisms of VEGF receptor ( VEGFR) 2-mediated. This research indicated that guajadial not only inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and migration but also suppress tumor growth in human NSCLC xenograft mouse models. It is also suggested that guajadial inhibited A549 proliferation via blocking the Ras/MAPK pathway.
