  Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) is effective treatment for Barrett 's esophagus ( BE). However , some patients have recurrence after complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia ( CEIM). We investigated the incidence of and factors associated with BE recurrence , with or without neoplasia , after RFA and CEIM using data from the national Veterans Affairs ( VA) healthcare system. We performed a retrospective cohort study of Veterans with BE treated by RFA from 2005 through 2016 with follow-up endoscopy. Subjects were followed until BE recurrence , neoplasia , death until October 2016. CEIM , BE recurrence , and factors associated with recurrence were identified by review of medical records. We calculated incidence rates of BE recurrence , with and without neoplasia , after CEIM and identified predictors using Cox proportional hazards models. We identified 430 Veterans with BE who were treated with RFA; of these 337 achieved CEIM ( 78.4 %). Most were men ( 98.6 %) , White ( 83.7 %) , and 66.0 % had baseline dysplasia. Of those with CEIM , 98 patients ( 29.1 %) had recurrence of BE during a total 906.0 patient-years of follow-up ( median 1.9 years) after CEIM ( incidence , 10.8 %/ patient-year). Dysplasia developed in 20 patients ( 2.2 %/ patient-year) and cancer in 3 patients ( 0.3 %/ patient-year). Baseline dysplasia ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.71; 95 % CI , 1.03-2.84) and long-segment BE ( HR , 1.61; 95 % CI , 1.03-2.54) increased risk of BE recurrence whereas treatment at high-volume RFA facilities reduced risk of BE recurrence ( for quartile 4 vs quartile 1: HR , 0.16; 95 % CI , 0.05-0.60). In a nationwide VA system study of outcomes of RFA for BE , we associated baseline dysplasia , long-segment BE , and treatment at low-volume RFA centers with recurrence of BE after CEIM. The findings call for performing these procedures in high-volume centers.
