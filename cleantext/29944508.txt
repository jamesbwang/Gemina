  The relationship between water ( W) content and silicon ( Si) content of silicone-hydrogel ( SiHy) contact lens materials was inspected using identical methodologies , equipment , and operators for materials composing 16 types of commercially available SiHy contact lenses. Fluorine ( F) content was included in the analysis for the three materials also containing a fluoropolymer. One type of lens consisted of a bulk SiHy material coated with thin layers of conventional hydrogel. SiHy materials were obtained in the form of 16 contact lens brands purchased on the open market in a common range of refractive powers from -3 to +6 D in single lots. All test lenses were equilibrated at room temperature in a standard saline recommended in the American National Standards Institute Z80.20-2016 and International Organization for Standardization ( ISO) 18369-4:2017 standards. W content was obtained gravimetrically , in % , according to those standards for 16 lenses of each SiHy material. Si content was determined in % using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy for four digested lenses of each material. F content was determined in % using an ion-selective electrode for four combusted lenses of each of the three fluorinated SiHy materials. W and Si contents of the bulk SiHy material of the coated lens were estimated by computational exclusion of the hydrogel layers. The linear coefficients of determination ( R , n = 16) were -0.7576 ( relating mean dry Si content ( n = 4) to mean W content ( n = 16)) and -0.8819 ( relating mean hydrated Si content ( n = 4) to mean W content ( n = 16)). When the 4 SiHy materials that were fluorinated or coated were excluded from the analysis , the R values ( n = 12) were -0.8869 and -0.9263 , respectively. When F contents and the coating were added to the assessments , the linear coefficients of determination ( R , n = 16) became -0.8948 ( relating mean dry ( Si + F) content to mean W content) and -0.9397 ( relating mean hydrated ( Si + F) content to mean W content). There is a fundamental negative linear relationship between Si and W contents for SiHy contact lens materials above 35 % W content that is followed when F content and hydrogel coatings are empirically added to the analysis below 35 % W content. The relationship was tightest for hydrated ( Si + F) content and W content , for which the regression equation had an R of -0.9397: ( Si + F) = -0.3073 ( W) +22.148. The relationship between ( Si + F) and W therefore seems to be based on composition rather than structure of available SiHy contact lens materials.
