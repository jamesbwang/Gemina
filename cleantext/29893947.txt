  The objective of this study was to ( 1) assess the effects of a group intervention called Siblings Coping Together on siblings ' psychosocial adjustment compared with controls; ( 2) explore the potential moderating effect of siblings ' gender; and ( 3) investigate whether the intervention was more effective for siblings with more depressive symptoms at baseline. This was a repeated measure , parallel randomized controlled trial ( RCT) with two groups. Seventy-five healthy siblings ( 7-16 years old , 41 males) participated. Both groups had 8 weekly 2-hr sessions. Intervention sessions had psychoeducational , social , and therapeutic problem-solving goals taught through games and crafts ( n = 41); controls ( n = 34) had games and crafts only. Self-reported symptoms of depression<symptom> ( Children 's Depression<symptom> Inventory , CDI) and self- and proxy-reported quality of life ( QOL) ( Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory , PedsQL) were obtained at baseline , postintervention , and 3 months later. Multivariable analyses with a mixed effects model were performed. No significant main group effect or group Ã— time interactions were found for any of the scales assessed. Significant improvement over time was found for total CDI ( p < .01) and proxy-reported PedsQL total ( p < .001) in both groups , which may have been attributable to the passage of time. No sufficient evidence was obtained for the efficacy of the intervention in the current study. Future research may examine conducting a larger RCT comparing sibling support group to no treatment control group.
