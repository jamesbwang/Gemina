  Pickering emulsions , also known as particle stabilized emulsions , are one kind of extremely important emulsion for both fundamental research and practical applications. Many colloidal particles have been utilized as emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering emulsions. However , the most challenging issue is preparing Pickering emulsions with highly hydrophilic particles , because their adsorption onto oil-water interfaces is either thermodynamically or kinetically unfavorable. Although several strategies have been developed to overcome the poor ability of the hydrophilic particles to stabilize the emulsions , surface modification and functionalization of the hydrophilic particles or a change in solvent (
