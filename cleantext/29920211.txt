  Existing evidence on influence of genetic architecture on serum cholesterol responsiveness to dietary interventions focuses on individual SNPs and single nutrients. We associated the combination of <i> ABCG5 </i> rs6720173-C , <i> CYP7A1 </i> rs3808607-TT , and <i> DHCR7 </i> rs760241-GG genotypes with lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations relative to the combination of rs6720173-GG , rs3808607-G , and rs760241-A genotypes ( -0.37 ± 0.12 ( n = 9) vs. +0.38 ± 0.14 mmol/L ( n = 7) , p = 0.0016) following a blended dairy ( 3 servings/day for 4 weeks) intervention.
