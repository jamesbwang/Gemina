  Bone is a unique tissue that has the ability to repair itself and return to full function. Bone regeneration is a well synchronized biological process that recapitulates embryonic bone development. The establishment of a functional vascular supply has been shown to be essential for proper ossification of newly deposited bone , and impaired angiogenesis as in advanced age , diabetes , and anti-cancer treatments affect bone repair. Endothelial Guanosine , 3 ' , 5 '- Cyclic Monophophate ( cGMP) is known to support angiogenesis , and sildenafil , a Phosphodiesterase 5 ( PDE5) antagonist , prevents cGMP hydrolysis and thereby , promotes the formation of new blood vessels. Since the development of functional vascular networks is critical to bone repair , we investigated the effects of sildenafil on early alveolar bone regeneration following exodontia. Our results demonstrate that per-oral administration of sildenafil ( 10 mg/kg/day) in rats delays the dissolution and replacement of the sanguine clot with granulation tissue. As a result , the number of replicating cells , a hallmark of regenerating tissue , observed on day 4 was remarkably lower in sildenafil-treated animals than their control counterparts ( mean ± SD; control: 47.35 ± 9.21; sildenafil: 11.47 ± 5.14). Similarly , cells expressing transcription factor Cbfa-1/ Runx2 and osteopontin , markers of differentiating osteoblasts , were fewer in treated animals ( mean ± SD; control: 83.18 ± 4.60; sildenafil: 13.77 ± 4.63). Treatment with hydrolysis-resistant cyclic GMP ( cGMP) showed findings similar to sildenafil-treated animals suggesting a negative impact of cGMP on early inflammatory phase of bone healing. However , histological differences were not significant between the 2 groups on day 8. Based on these findings , we conclude that sildenafil temporarily retards early events in alveolar bone healing.
