  Progressive myoclonus epilepsies ( PMEs) comprise a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by action myoclonus , epileptic<symptom> seizures<symptom> , and ataxia<symptom> with progressive neurologic decline. Due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity of PMEs , it is difficult to decide which genes are affected. The aim of this study was to report an action myoclonus with or without renal<symptom> failure<symptom> syndrome<symptom> ( EPM4) family and summarize the clinical and genetic characteristics of all reported EPM4 patients. In the present study , targeted next-generation sequencing ( NGS) was applied to screen causative genes in a Chinese PME family. The candidate variant was further confirmed by cosegregation analysis and further functional analysis , including the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot of the proband 's muscle. Moreover , literature data on the clinical and mutational features of all reported EPM4 patients were reviewed. The gene analysis revealed a novel homozygous splicing mutation ( c.995-1G > A) of the SCARB2 gene in two brothers. Further functional analysis revealed that this mutation led to loss function of the SCARB2 protein. The classification of the candidate variant , according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards and guidelines and functional analysis , was pathogenic. Therefore , these two brothers were finally diagnostically confirmed as EPM4. These present results suggest the potential for targeted NGS to conduct a more rapid and precise diagnosis for PME patients. A literature review revealed that mutations in the different functional domains of SCARB2 appear to be associated with the phenotype of EPM4.
