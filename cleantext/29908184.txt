  Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) protease is a two-component complex in which NS3 contains the catalytic triad and NS2B cofactor region is important for protease folding and activity. A protease construct-eZiPro without the transmembrane domains of NS2B was designed. Structural study on eZiPro reveals that the Thr-Gly-Lys-Arg ( TGKR) sequence at the C-terminus of NS2B binds to the active site after cleavage. The bZiPro construct only contains NS2B cofactor region and the N-terminus of NS3 without any artificial linker or protease cleavage site , giving rise to an empty pocket accessible to substrate and inhibitor binding. Herein , we demonstrate that the TGKR sequence of NS2B in eZiPro is dynamic. Peptides from NS2B with various lengths exhibit different binding affinities to bZiPro. TGKR binding to the active site in eZiPro does not affect protease binding to small-molecule compounds. Our results suggest that eZiPro will also be useful for evaluating small-molecule protease inhibitors.
