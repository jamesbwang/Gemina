  Posterior shoulder dislocation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute shoulder pain and immobility following trauma. Although far less common then the anterior dislocation , it is associated with high rates of comorbidity. Seventy-nine percent of posterior shoulder dislocations are missed on initial presentation , which is partially responsible for the high rate of comorbidity associated with these injuries. The mechanism of injury is varied from generalized seizure<symptom> to minor trauma , which adds to the complexity of the diagnosis. There is a well-documented `` vulnerable position '' described as injury to the arm while it is in a flexed , adducted , and internally rotated position that is highly associated with posterior shoulder dislocation. The plain film scapular Y is the most clinically significant imaging and can be used alone to diagnose the injury , although ancillary imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging is often warranted. Once this rare condition has been diagnosed , there are a number of appropriate reduction techniques available to the health care provider. Presented here is a case of posterior shoulder dislocation that occurred while doing pushups for routine morning physical training. Also discussed are keys to recognition and treatment as well as a brief discussion of associated complications of the injury.
