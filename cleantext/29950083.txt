  To screen the target for the treatment of depression<symptom> of Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma and Curcumae Radix using the pharmacological method of network pharmacology , in order to define the mechanism of antidepressant effect. Pharmacological data ( TCMSP) of forall of chemical constituents of Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma and Curcumae Radix through traditional Chinese medicine system ( TCMSP) was retrieved to screen the target sites , and construct the component target PPI network. PharmGkb database was retrieved for the genes associated with depression<symptom> , and the disease target was mapped using the Cytoscape software. The Cytoscape software was used to merge the network and filter the core network , and further analyze the gene GO function and the KEGG pathway enrichment. There were 62 nodes and 87 connections on the target PPI network. The PPI network had 1 289 nodes and 17 714 connections. After the network merged , the component-target-disease network had 1 337 nodes and 17 801 connections. Through screening the core network , there were 63 nodes and 935 connections , which represented the complex interaction between the components and the target. Gene GO functional analysis suggested that biological processes , molecular functions and cell components were involved. Gene KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed associations with misfolded protein , secretory hormone secretion , and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. The possible mechanism for treating depression<symptom> is the adjustment of wrong folding protein , sex hormone secretion and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons.
