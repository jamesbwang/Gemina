Physicians have obligations to ensure that ( 1) their own discomfort with children 's pain does n't lead them to make pain management decisions that could place a patient at greater risk and ( 2) to engage in thoughtful , individualized pain management strategies. Long-term consequences of overzealous pain medication administration , for example , could include delayed recovery and integration or opioid dependence. The need to create individualized approaches to pain management , based on published guidelines , is discussed along with uses of nonpharmacological treatment for both adults and children.
