  Although the influence of uncertainty and intolerance of uncertainty ( IU) on anxiety<symptom> pathologies has been well-established , only a few studies examined the interaction between uncertainty and IU in producing anxiety<symptom>. Meanwhile , there is a lack of research utilizing experimental methods to manipulate the situational uncertainty. Therefore , the current study aimed to more systematically investigate whether and how trait IU interacted with uncertainty in the production of anxiety<symptom>. the current study examined the influence of threat-related uncertainty and IU on anxiety<symptom> in a lab setting. A variant of the threat-of-shock paradigm was employed to manipulate the uncertainty level. State anxiety<symptom> and worry were measured immediately before and after this manipulation. Hierarchical linear modeling was used for data analysis. Results showed that trait IU contributed to elevated state anxiety<symptom> and worry. Meanwhile , when under imminent threat , uncertainty provoked increased worry but exerted limited influence on state anxiety<symptom>. The interaction effect of uncertainty and IU on anxiety<symptom> was not evident in this study. Results were based on a non-clinical sample rather than individuals with clinical diagnoses. Uncertainty could be regarded as a trigger of worrying thoughts , while IU is an important cognitive vulnerability factor of anxiety<symptom> and related symptoms. The possible reasons for these findings and their implications were discussed in light of theoretical models of anxiety<symptom> , worry , and IU.
