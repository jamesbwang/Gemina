  The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of combination therapy ( HD-ECM) including high-dose cytarabine in initial induction therapy with that of combination therapy ( ECM) involving the continuous administration of cytarabine for previously untreated , newly diagnosed patients with AML at < 18 years of age. This is a seamless Phase II-III clinical trial , consisting of Phase II and III parts. In the Phase II part , the safety of the experimental treatment ( HD-ECM) will be examined. Subsequently , the Phase III study will compare the efficacy and safety of HD-ECM with that of standard ECM. The primary endpoint of the Phase II study is the early mortality rate. The primary endpoints of the Phase III study are the 3-year event-free survival rate and the positive minimal residual disease rate by flow cytometry after initial induction therapy. This trial has been registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry ( UMIN000013288).
