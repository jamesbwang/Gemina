  Cellular senescence , a form of stable cell cycle arrest induced by cellular stress , constitutes a major factor leading to the promotion of pathologies and physiological decays that take place during ageing. However , in recent years evidence has started to emerge supporting a positive role for senescent cells in various physiological processes , from embryonic development to tissue injury responses such as wound<disease> healing and tissue repair. Here , we provide an overview of cellular senescence , its negative as well as positive outcomes , with a focus on its impact on tissue repair. Furthermore , we discuss the possibility that cell senescence could contribute to the regeneration of complex structures and explore recent findings with respect to their potential for therapeutic application.
