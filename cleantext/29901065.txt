  A new and efficient Ionic Liquid-Supported Oligosaccharide Synthesis ( ILSOS) strategy for an N-linked core pentasaccharide on a 10 g scale is reported. This new ILSOS includes a new spacer for an IL support , a new tagging strategy , and fast , efficient and orthogonal removal of the ionic-liquid support , producing the N-linked core pentasaccharide with direct applicability potential in a short time , with high yield and on a large gram scale.
