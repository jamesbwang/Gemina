  The aim of this study was to compare the quality of electroretinogram ( ERG) recordings using a custom built active electrode with attached amplifier versus a standard ( passive) ERG electrode. Scotopic and photopic ERG responses were recorded from five adult albino rabbits using a custom built active electrode on one eye and a passive electrode on the other. For the active electrode , the ERG-jet electrode ( Universo S.A. , La Chaux-De-Fonds , Switzerland) was used as the transducer with the cable cut short and soldered directly to the input of a customized amplifier. The passive electrode was a standard ERG jet electrode. The signal to noise ratio and reproducibility of ERGs were compared. The noise was significantly lower in the active electrode compared to the passive electrode ( p = 0.009) resulting in signals being recorded at lower stimulation strengths with the active electrode. The scotopic a-wave was significantly larger in the active electrode at all supra-threshold stimulation intensities ( p < 0.05) and the scotopic b-wave amplitudes were also higher in the active electrode at all supra-threshold stimulation intensities but was only statistically significant between -3.25 and -1 log cd.s.m
