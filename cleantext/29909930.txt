  Vascular obstructions in small animals have numerous etiologies and variable signs depending on location and chronicity. The decision to treat and by which method ( medical , interventional , surgical) can be challenging. A combined approach of catheter-directed thrombolysis , angioplasty , or vascular stenting may be most appropriate for acute thrombosis , though optimal therapeutic strategies are undefined in this population. The role of embolic trapping devices in animals is uncertain. Chronic cases of vascular obstruction , with collateral flow and neither ischemia nor venous congestion<symptom> manifest , may be conservatively managed. Prospective clinical studies are needed to better guide management of vascular obstructions in veterinary medicine.
