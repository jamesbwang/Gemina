  Investigators have long suspected that pathogenic microbes might contribute to the onset and progression of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) although definitive evidence has not been presented. Whether such findings represent a causal contribution , or reflect opportunistic passengers of neurodegeneration , is also difficult to resolve. We constructed multiscale networks of the late-onset AD-associated virome , integrating genomic , transcriptomic , proteomic , and histopathological data across four brain regions from human post-mortem tissue. We observed increased human<pathogen> herpesvirus<pathogen> 6A ( HHV-6A) and human<pathogen> herpesvirus<pathogen> 7 ( HHV-7) from subjects with AD compared with controls. These results were replicated in two additional , independent and geographically dispersed cohorts. We observed regulatory relationships linking viral abundance and modulators of APP metabolism , including induction of APBB2 , APPBP2 , BIN1 , BACE1 , CLU , PICALM , and PSEN1 by HHV-6A. This study elucidates networks linking molecular , clinical , and neuropathological features with viral activity and is consistent with viral activity constituting a general feature of AD.
