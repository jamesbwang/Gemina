  Creatinine is actively secreted across tubular epithelial cells via organic cation transporter 2 ( OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 ( MATE1). We previously showed that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) crizotinib inhibits OCT2-mediated transport of creatinine. In the present work , we examined the inhibitory potency of TKIs , including crizotinib , on MATE1-mediated transport of creatinine. Then , we used the kinetic parameters estimated in this and the previous work to predict the potential impact of TKIs on serum creatinine level ( SCr) via reversible inhibition of creatinine transport. Crizotinib inhibited (
