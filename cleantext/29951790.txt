  To evaluate whether elderly patients aged ≥ 75 years with locally advanced prostate cancer ( LAPC) may benefit from local treatment ( LT). Elderly patients aged ≥ 75 years with non-metastatic cT3-4 LAPC who were treated with LT ( radical prostatectomy ( RP) , radiation therapy ( RT)) or non-LT ( NLT) were identified. After propensity score matching ( PSM) , cancer-specific mortality ( CSM) and other-cause mortality ( OCM) rates were assessed. In the assessment of LT vs. NLT and RP vs. RT , multivariable competing risk regression ( MVA CRR) analysis was used. 368 and 482 paired patients were matched for LT vs. NLT and RP vs. RT , respectively. 5 and 10 years CSM rates were 9.4 vs. 18.5 % in LT and 24.9 vs. 29.3 % in NLT-treated patients , respectively ( P < 0.0001). 5 and 10 years CSM rates were 3.4 % vs. 8.6 % in RP and 6.7 % vs. 15.1 % in RT-treated patients , respectively ( P = 0.10). In the MVA CRR model , after PSM , NLT resulted in higher CSM rates in Gleason score 8-10 ( subhazard ratio ( sHR) = 2.83 , P < 0.001) , cT3b/4 ( sHR = 3.97/ 2.56 , P = 0.003/ 0.002) , cN0 ( sHR = 2.52 , P < 0.001) or PSA > 10 ng/ml ( sHR ( PSA = 10.1-20 ng/ml) = 4.59 , P = 0.03; sHR ( PSA > 20 ng/ml) = 2.77 , P = 0.001) patients compared with LT. However , no statistically significant difference in CSM was observed between RP and RT , except for cT3a patients in whom higher CSM rates were noted for RT compared with RP ( sHR = 3.91 , P = 0.02). LAPC patients may benefit from local treatment despite advanced age. However , this benefit was only seen in patients with cT3b/4 , Gleason score 8-10 , cN0 or PSA > 10 ng/ml.
