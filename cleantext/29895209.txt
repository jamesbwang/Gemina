  Acute kidney injury ( AKI) is a medical condition characterized by kidney damage with a rapid decline of renal function , which is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Recent research has further established an intimate relationship between AKI and chronic kidney disease. Perturbations of kidney cells in AKI result in the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) , leading to unfolded protein response ( UPR) or ER stress. In this review , we analyze the role and regulation of ER stress in AKI triggered by renal ischemia-reperfusion and cisplatin nephrotoxicity. The balance<symptom> between the two major components of UPR , the adaptive pathway and the apoptotic pathway , plays a critical role in determining the cell fate in ER stress. The adaptive pathway is evoked to attenuate translation , induce chaperones , maintain protein homeostasis and promote cell survival. Prolonged ER stress activates the apoptotic pathway , resulting in the elimination of dysfunctional cells. Therefore , regulating ER stress in kidney cells may provide a therapeutic target in AKI. KEY MESSAGES Perturbations of kidney cells in acute kidney injury result in the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in ER , leading to unfolded protein response ( UPR) or ER stress. The balance<symptom> between the adaptive pathway and the apoptotic pathway of UPR plays a critical role in determining the cell fate in ER stress. Modulation of ER stress in kidney cells may provide a therapeutic strategy for acute kidney injury.
