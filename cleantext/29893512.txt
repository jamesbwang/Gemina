  The clinical course of multiple sclerosis ( MS) can vary significantly among patients and is affected by exogenous and endogenous factors. Among these , stress and personality type have been gaining more attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the parameters of event-related potentials ( ERPs) with regards to stress perception and personality type , as well as cognitive performance in MS patients. The study group consisted of 30 MS patients and 26 healthy controls. Auditory ERPs were performed in both groups , including an analysis of P300 and N200 response parameters. The Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS) was used in the MS group to measure the perception of stress. The D-type Scale ( DS14) scale was used to determine the features of Type D personality , characterized by social inhibition and negative affectivity. The score on the PSS corresponded with a moderate or high level of stress perception in 63 % of MS patients , while 23 % of patients presented with a Type D personality. P300 latencies were significantly longer ( p = 0.001) , N200 amplitudes were significantly higher ( p = 0.004) , and N200 latencies were longer in MS patients than in the controls. Strong positive correlations were found between N200 and P300 amplitudes , as well as between the DS14 and PSS results. Most MS patients experience moderate to severe stress. ERP abnormalities were found in MS patients who did not have overt cognitive impairment and showed correlations with stress levels and negative affectivity. Event-related potentials may be useful in assessing the influence of stress and emotions on the course of MS.
