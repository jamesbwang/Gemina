  Background and objective Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is a growing phenomenon worldwide. It is considered a medical problem because , besides the socio-economic issues involved , pain is often accompanied by psychosocial problems. Apart from the physical pain , living with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> has many additional consequences. People living with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> generally suffer from other physical and psychological consequences. The impact of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> varies enormously between individuals , but the suffering is frequently pervasive and detrimental. The objective of this study was to review the evidence concerning , ways in which people living with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> are affected in their everyday lives. Methods Electronic databases Scopus , Cinahl and PsycINFO were searched from 2008 to September 2012 using a ` building blocks ' approach and reference lists were scanned. PubMed was also searched and checked for duplicates compared to Scopus , Cinahl and PsycINFO. Data were extracted from included studies and methodological quality assessed with a view to exploring quality differences. To guide the review and interpretation , individual components of methodological quality were compared against a checklist. A narrative synthesis was formulated involving three categories: ( 1) clinical aspects , ( 2) everyday life aspects and ( 3) interpersonal aspects. Results The search strategy identified 1140 citations; one study was found during the preliminary searching through references , and a search of reference lists provided five publications. Of these , 24 publications , representing 23 populations , met the inclusion criteria. In total , there were 22 cross-sectional studies and 2 cohort studies. Study populations ranged from 74 to 3928 participants and were heterogeneous in nature across studies with respect to age , duration and localisations of pain and outcome measures. We found a general consensus that life with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> was associated with higher prevalence and higher levels of depression<symptom> and diagnoses of widespread pain and nonspecific pain are more clearly associated with depression<symptom> than is specific pain. The results of link between chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> and stress were not obvious. Overall , there is plausible evidence to suggest a positive relationship between chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and disability and the evidence is stronger for a significant positive association between nonspecific pain and disability , compared to specific pain. It can be summarized that there is a lack of evidence for a relationship between intensity of pain and quality of life. However , there is evidence that nonspecific pain is more compellingly associated with low quality of life than is specific pain. The evidence of a positive relation between pain and problems in close relations is not convincing but there is an indication to suggest that there is a pain-related issue regarding participation in many social aspects of everyday life. Conclusion Besides the pain itself , people living with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> are affected in other aspects of life. In particular , it is evident that they experience challenges with respect to depressive thoughts , disability , lower quality of life and conflicts in close relationships. Implications When designing interventions for people with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , it is essential to take into consideration the fact that living with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> has far-reaching consequences beyond the pain suffered.
