  The Meta-play Method is a play-based , naturalistic set of interventions designed to decrease the symptoms associated with autism in toddlers. The purpose of the present study was to explore the feasibility of using this intervention set with a small group of toddlers and their parents. We selected seven toddlers diagnosed with autism and tested these children for autism severity and severity of repetitive behaviors. Parents were trained on the basic concepts of DBTA and the Meta-play activities. Researchers reviewed the integrity of interventions at once- or twice-monthly home visits for a six-month period , and recorded progress as rated by the parent. Activities were adapted at each visit to the interests and progress of the participating toddler. At the end of six months , autism symptoms and repetitive behavior decreased and parents reported high levels of social validity. Additional aspects of data collection and outcome measures , and suitability of interventions and procedures are discussed. While some outcomes were encouraging , a number of changes are recommended for future research.
