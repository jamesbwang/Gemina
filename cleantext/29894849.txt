  Pico sized Stannous oxide particles ( SnO PPs) were synthesized in an ethanol-water solvent system on the surface of nitrogen doped graphene oxide ( GO). The highly conductive support was a combination of dual interactions between 4-aminomethylbenzylamine ( AMBA) and GO. The oppositely positioned- NH
