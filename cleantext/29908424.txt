  Phenolic acids are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological activity. However , low oral bioavailability restricts their application. In this study , a high dispersed phyto- phospholipid complex with mesoporous silica containing TPGS 1000 ( TPC-SD) was fabricated using Tanshinol ( Tan) as model drug. Phospholipid complex ( PC) was employed to improve the n-octanol/water partition coefficient ( log P) and apparent permeability coefficients ( P
