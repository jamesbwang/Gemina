  Individuals with schizophrenia lead a poor quality of life , due to poor medical attention , homelessness , unemployment , financial constraints , lack of education , and poor social skills. Thus , a review of factors associated with the holistic management of schizophrenia is of paramount importance. The objective of this review is to improve the quality of life of individuals with schizophrenia , by addressing the factors related to the needs of the patients and present them in a unified manner. Although medications play a role , other factors that lead to a successful holistic management of schizophrenia include addressing the following: financial management , independent community living , independent living skill , relationship , friendship , entertainment , regular exercise for weight gained due to medication administration , co-morbid health issues , and day-care programmes for independent living. This review discusses the relationship between different symptoms and problems individuals with schizophrenia face ( e.g. , homelessness and unemployment) , and how these can be managed using pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. Thus , the target of this review is the carers of individuals with schizophrenia , public health managers , counselors , case workers , psychiatrists , and clinical psychologists aiming to enhance the quality of life of individuals with schizophrenia.
