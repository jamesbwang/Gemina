  In ongoing investigations into colours in Nature , the chemical constituents from the flowers of Acacia pycnantha and Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don grown in Australia are reported. Eight known secondary metabolites were isolated from the A. pycnantha flower including isosalipurposide ( 7) which may be responsible for their distinctive colouration. Nine secondary metabolites were isolated from the J. mimosifolia D.Don flower including the new phenylethanoid β-D-glucopyranose ( 10). All isolated compounds were inactive against bacteria tested at concentration of 32 μg/mL.
