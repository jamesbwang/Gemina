  The HSV1 virion host shutoff ( vhs) protein is an endoribonuclease that binds to the cellular translation initiation machinery and degrades associated mRNAs , resulting in shut-off of host protein synthesis. Hence its unrestrained activity is considered to be lethal , and it has been proposed that vhs is regulated by two other virus proteins , VP22 and VP16. We have found that during infection , translation of vhs requires VP22 but not the VP22-VP16 complex. Moreover , in the absence of VP22 , vhs is not overactive against cellular or viral transcripts. In transfected cells , vhs was also poorly translated , correlating with aberrant localization of its mRNA. Counterintuitively , vhs mRNA was predominantly nuclear in cells where vhs protein was detected. Likewise , transcripts from co-transfected plasmids were also retained in the same nuclei where vhs mRNA was located , while polyA binding protein ( PABP) was relocalised to the nucleus in a vhs-dependent manner , implying a general block to mRNA export. Co-expression of VP16 and VP22 rescued cytoplasmic localization of vhs mRNA but failed to rescue vhs translation. We identified a 230-nucleotide sequence in the 5 ' region of vhs that blocked its translation and , when transferred to a heterologous GFP transcript , reduced translation without altering mRNA levels or localization. We propose that expression of vhs is tightly regulated by a combination of inherent untranslatability and auto-induced nuclear retention of its mRNA that results in a negative feedback loop , with nuclear retention but not translation of vhs mRNA being the target of rescue by the vhs-VP16-VP22 complex.
