  The use of microsurgery for aneurysm<disease> clipping has decreased considerably in recent years. This study was conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of surgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms<disease> even in less-developed countries. This study was a retrospective review of the medical records of 320 patients with 416 aneurysms<disease> treated with microsurgical clipping at a single neurosurgical center in Brazil between 2008 and 2016. We evaluated postoperative outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) at the time of hospital discharge , treatment efficacy by digital subtraction angiography ( DSA) performed postoperatively , and mortality. The 320 patients with aneurysms<disease> included 228 patients with ruptured aneurysms<disease> and 92 with unruptured aneurysms<disease>. Overall , 81 ( 26.3 %) had a poor outcome ( mRS score > 2) , and the other 227 ( 73.4 %) had a good outcome. The presence of a ruptured aneurysm<disease> was a statistically significant factor for poor outcome ( P < 0.001) and mortality ( P < 0.015). Giant and large aneurysms<disease> were also associated with poor outcome ( P = 0.004). When analyzed separately , unruptured aneurysms<disease> with poor outcome were only associated with aneurysm<disease> size. Among the patients with ruptured aneurysms<disease> , those with Hunt and Hess ( HH) grade > 2 on hospital admission had unfavorable outcomes ( P < 0.0001). Among the patients who underwent postoperative DSA , 207 ( 89.8 %) had complete aneurysm<disease> occlusion and 24 ( 10.2 %) had residual aneurysms<disease> , with reoperation required in 8 cases. Microsurgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms<disease> is an effective and safe method.
