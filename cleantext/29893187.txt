  This study aimed to provide normative data for four trials of the Rey figure Test- a complex design used to assess visuoconstructional abilities , aspects of visual memory , and aspects of executive functioning. Despite its frequent clinical and research use in the Arab region , published studies regarding the measures ' adaptation or normative data remain absent. We administered the Rey figure on a convenience sample of Lebanese ( n = 254) aged 30 years to 99. We examined the impact of relevant demographics , and found that age , gender , and years of education impacted scores , and norms were derived based on these variables. Such normative data for the Rey figure enhance its practicality and psychometric adequacy for use in research and clinical settings in Lebanon.
