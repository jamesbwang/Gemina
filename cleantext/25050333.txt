  To study the difference of the Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DCE-MRI) parameters among the primary tumor , metastatic node and peripheral normal tissue of head and neck cancer. Consecutive newly-diagnosed head and neck cancer patients with nodal metastasis between December 2010 and July 2013 were recruited , and 25 patients ( 8 females; 24 ~ 63 , mean 43 Â± 11 years old) were enrolled. DCE-MRI was performed in the primary tumor region including the regional lymph nodes on a 3.0-T MRI system. Three quantitative parameters: Ktrans ( volume transfer constant) , ve ( volume fraction of extravascular extracellular space) and kep ( the rate constant of contrast transfer) were calculated for the largest node. A repeated-measure ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction and post hoc tests using the Bonferroni correction were used to evaluate the differences in Ktrans , ve and kep among primary tumors , metastatic nodes and normal tissue. The values of both Ktrans and ve of normal tissue differed significantly from those of nodes ( both P < 0.001) and primary tumors ( both P < 0.001) respectively , while no significant differences of Ktrans and ve were observed between nodes and primary tumors ( P = 0.075 and 0.365 respectively). The kep values of primary tumors were significantly different from those of nodes ( P = 0.001) and normal tissue ( P = 0.002) , while no significant differences between nodes and normal tissue ( P > 0.999). The DCE-MRI parameters were different in the tumors , metastatic nodes and normal tissue in head and neck cancer. These findings may be useful in the characterization of head and neck cancer.
