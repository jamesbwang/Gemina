  Adenomyosis has a negative impact on female fertility. GnRH agonist treatment can improve pregnancy outcomes in women with adenomyosis. However , the impact of GnRH agonist upon endometrium receptivity of patients with adenomyosis remains unclear. In this study , endometrial receptivity and pregnancy outcome were investigated using a mouse model of adenomyosis. Adenomyosis was induced in 12 female ICR mice , neonatally treated with tamoxifen , while another six female mice ( control group) received solvent only. At 75 days , the induced adenomyosis group was randomly divided into two groups: an untreated group and a group treated with GnRH agonist ( n = 6 each). Sixty days later , the mice were mated and pregnancy outcomes were observed and compared among the three groups ( n = 6 each). In a parallel experiment using the same treatment regimes , uterus samples were collected on day 4 of pregnancy for immunohistochemistry , gene ( quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and protein expression ( Western blot) , and scanning electron microscopy analyses. We found that the average live litter size was reduced in the adenomyosis compared with control group ( 8 ± 0.56 versus 13 ± 0.71; Adenomyosis may have an adverse impact on endometrial receptivity and reduce pregnancy outcomes in mice. However , GnRH agonist may improve the pregnancy outcome by partially restoring endometrial receptivity.
