  Atomically thin Janus transition metal dichalcogenides ( JTMDs) with an asymmetric structure have emerged as a new class of intriguing two-dimensional ( 2D) semiconductor materials. Using state-of-the-art density functional theory ( DFT) calculations , we systematically investigate the structural , electronic , and optical properties of JTMD monolayers and heterostructures. Our calculated results indicate that the JTMD monolayers suffer from a bending strain but present high thermodynamic stability. All of them are semiconductors with a band-gap range from 1.37 to 1.96 eV. They possess pronounced optical absorption in the visible-light region and cover a large range of carrier mobilities from 28 to 606 cm2 V-1 s-1 , indicating strong anisotropic characteristics. Significantly , some monolayer JTMDs ( e.g. , WSSe and WSeTe) exhibit superior mobilities than conventional TMD monolayers , such as MoS2. Moreover , the absolute band-edge positions of the JTMD monolayers are higher than the water redox potential , and most JTMD heterostructures have a type-II band alignment that contributes to the separation of carriers. Our work suggests that the 2D JTMD monolayers are promising for nanoelectronic , optoelectronic , and photocatalytic applications.
