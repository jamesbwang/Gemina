  The pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) involves complement activation. Activation of complement through the classical pathway ( CP) is well established. However , complement activation through pattern recognition not only happens through the CP , but also through the lectin pathway ( LP). We investigated the hypothesis that the LP is activated in SLE and involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Using immunoassays developed in-house , we measured concentrations of LP proteins in a cohort of 372 patients with SLE and 170 controls. We estimated complement activation measuring total C3 , and investigated whether LP protein concentrations were associated with complement activation and disease activity. Protein changes and disease activity over time were assessed in a cohort of 52 patients with SLE followed with repeated samples over a 5-year period. Concentrations of LP proteins in SLE were altered compared with controls. The differences observed in LP proteins associated with complement activation were reflected by a decrease in total C3. The pattern recognition molecules ( M-ficolin , CL-L1 , and CL-K1) , the serine protease ( MASP-3) , and the associated protein ( MAp19) displayed a negative correlation with disease activity. Changes in MASP-2 concentrations over time correlated significantly with increased disease activity. Association between active proteinuria<symptom> and serum concentration was observed for MASP-3 and MAp19. In patients with SLE , we measured specific changes in LP proteins that are associated with complement activation and disease activity , indicating that the LP is activated in patients with SLE. These novel findings substantiate the involvement of the LP in SLE.
