  Are some people truly better able to accurately perceive the personality of others? Previous research suggests that the good judge may be of little practical importance and individual differences minimal. In four large samples we assessed whether expressive accuracy ( the good target) is a necessary condition for perceptive accuracy ( the good judge) to emerge. As predicted from Funder 's ( 1995) realistic accuracy model , assessments of the good judge predicted increased impression accuracy in the context of judgments of the good target. In contrast , evaluative tendencies for judges did not evidence a similar interaction; the positivity of impressions did not reliably increase as a function of how positively targets tend to be viewed. The present results suggest the good judge does indeed exist-some individuals are much better able to detect and utilize valid cues from targets-but this is only strongly evident when perceiving a good target.
