  In this study , we fabricated paclitaxel ( PTX) and etoposide ( ETP) loaded Poly ( lactic-co-glycolic acid) ( PLGA) microspheres with core-shell structures and particle sizes ranging from 1 to 4 Âµm by coaxial electrospraying. The microspheres were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM). The drug loading rate and entrapment efficiency of the microspheres were detected by high performance liquid chromatograph ( HPLC). Moreover , the drug release profiles and degradation of drug-loaded PLGA microspheres in vitro were investigated , respectively. The distinct layered structure that existed in the manufactured core-shell microspheres can be observed by TEM. The in vitro release profiles indicated that the PLGA/PTX + ETP ( PLGA/PE) microspheres exhibited the controlled release of two drugs in a sequential manner. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to detect the toxic and side effects of the microspheres on bone tumor cells. PTX and ETP for combination drug therapy loaded microspheres had more cytotoxic effect on saos-2 osteosarcoma cells than the individual drugs. In conclusion , core-shell PLGA microspheres by electrospraying for combination drug therapy is promising for medicine applications , the PLGA/PE microspheres have some potential for osteosarcoma treatment.
