  Controlled experimental protocols for metabolic cost assessment of speed changing locomotion are quite complex to be designed and managed. The use of the ` equivalent slope ' , i.e. the gradient locomotion at constant speed metabolically equivalent to a level progression in acceleration , proved to be useful to estimate the metabolic cost of speed changing gaits<symptom>. However , its use with steep slopes forces to extrapolate the experimental cost vs. gradient function for constant running speed , resulting in less reliable estimates. The present study extended the model to work also with deceleration , and revised that predictive equation to be applied to much higher levels of speed change. The case of shuttle running at different distances ( from 5 +5 to 20 +20 m) was then investigated throughout the novel approach and software , and the predictions in terms of metabolic cost and efficiency well compare to the experimental data.
