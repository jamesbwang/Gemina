  To comprehensively evaluate the association of paternal smoking and spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study among 5 770 691 non-smoking rural Chinese women , along with their husbands , participating in the National Free Pre-Pregnancy Checkups Project , regarding outcome events that occurred in 2010-2016. The main outcome was spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> ( SA). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate OR and 95 % CI , and restricted cubic spline was used to estimate the non-linear relationship. The multivariable-adjusted OR of exposure to paternal smoking for SA was 1.17 ( 95 % CI 1.16 to 1.19) , compared with women without exposure to paternal smoking; and corresponding OR of exposure to preconception paternal smoking for SA was 1.11 ( 95 % CI 1.08 to 1.14) , compared with women without exposure to preconception paternal smoking. The ORs of preconception paternal smoking also increased with increases in paternal smoking ( p Paternal smoking was associated with SA. The importance of tobacco control , specifically pertaining to paternal smoking , should be emphasised during preconception and pregnancy counselling.
