  The rabies<pathogen> incidence and number of dogs in Cambodia are much higher than in nearby countries. Knowledge and behaviors which are related to rabies<pathogen> and/or dogs are considered to be contributing factors for rabies<pathogen> infection control in the community; however , such information in rural Cambodia is limited. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess knowledge and experiences related to rabies<pathogen> as well as dog-related behaviors among people in Siem Reap Province , and to identify the specific factors associated with adequate knowledge. Four-stage sampling was employed to identify villages and households. In total , 360 respondents were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Data were descriptively summarized and logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios of adequate knowledge related to rabies<pathogen> for respondents ' characteristics. Only 9.7 % of respondents had adequate knowledge of rabies<pathogen>. Of the respondents , 86.9 and 18.3 % had experienced hearing of or seeing a suspected rabid dog and a suspected rabid human , respectively. More than two-thirds ( 70.6 %) of households had at least one dog , and the ratio of dog to human populations was 1: 2.8. Only a few owners had vaccinated dogs , used a cage , or tied up their dog. Visiting a health center was the first choice of treatment for respondents when bitten by a dog. However , post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP) was not commonly expected as a treatment choice by respondents. Those with higher education were more likely to have adequate knowledge than those with no education ( adjusted OR 12.34 , 95 % CI 2.64-57.99 , High dog population , inadequate knowledge of rabies<pathogen> , low recognition of human rabies<pathogen> , and poor dog management were found to be serious challenges for controlling rabies<pathogen>. Health education related to rabies<pathogen> should be introduced , targeting farmers in particular who easily encounter stray dogs but have little knowledge of rabies<pathogen> risk factors and signs. At the same time , PEP delivery and dog management should be improved.
