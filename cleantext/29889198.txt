  Site-specific eukaryotic genome editing with CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)- Cas ( CRISPR-associated) systems has quickly become a commonplace amongst researchers pursuing a wide variety of biological questions. Users most often employ the Cas9 protein derived from Streptococcus<pathogen> pyogenes<pathogen> in a complex with an easily reprogrammed guide RNA ( gRNA). These components are introduced into cells , and through a base pairing with a complementary region of the double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA) genome , the enzyme cleaves both strands to generate a double-strand break ( DSB). Subsequent repair leads to either random insertion or deletion events ( indels) or the incorporation of experimenter-provided DNA at the site of the break. The use of a purified single-guide RNA and Cas9 protein , preassembled to form an RNP and delivered directly to cells , is a potent approach for achieving highly efficient gene editing. RNP editing particularly enhances the rate of gene insertion , an outcome that is often challenging to achieve. Compared to the delivery via a plasmid , the shorter persistence of the Cas9 RNP within the cell leads to fewer off-target events. Despite its advantages , many casual users of CRISPR gene editing are less familiar with this technique. To lower the barrier to entry , we outline detailed protocols for implementing the RNP strategy in a range of contexts , highlighting its distinct benefits and diverse applications. We cover editing in two types of primary human cells , T cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells ( HSPCs). We also show how Cas9 RNP editing enables the facile genetic manipulation of entire organisms , including the classic model roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> and the more recently introduced model crustacean , Parhyale hawaiensis.
