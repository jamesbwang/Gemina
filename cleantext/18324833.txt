  The general misconception that γ-lactones are not thermodynamically polymerizable has limited the development of all γ-lactone-based copolymers. A few studies have reported copolymerization of these five-membered cyclic esters with more reactive monomers , yet a systematic investigation of kinetics and thermodynamics is still lacking. To explore the feasibility of the reaction , we combined equilibrium and non-isothermal syntheses for the copolymerization of γ-valerolactone with ϵ-caprolactone , initiated with methoxy polyethyleneglycol and catalyzed by Tin ( II) 2-ethylhexanoate. Here , we present the polymerization kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for different monomer ratios in the reaction feed. We observed the dependency of enthalpy and entropy of polymerization upon monomer ratio changes , and estimated a linear increase in the activation energy by increasing the γ-valerolactone fraction in the starting monomer mixture. Our data demonstrate that γ-valerolactone can copolymerize with ϵ-caprolactone , but only under specific conditions. The reaction parameters determined in this study will enable preparation of additional γ-valerolactone-based copolymers and development of a family of degradable materials with improved properties in respect to commonly used polyesters.
