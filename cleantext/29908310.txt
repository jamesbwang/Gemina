  Individual differences in aesthetic engagement-the propensity to be moved by art , nature , and beauty-are associated with positive health outcomes , as well as stress resilience. The purpose of the current study was to identify potential neural substrate mechanisms underlying individual differences in aesthetic engagement and reported proneness to aesthetic chill<symptom>. Data from the Human Connectome Project ( HCP) 1200 Subjects Release were utilized. Resting-state fMRI connectivity was extracted for 361 regions in the brain including cortical , subcortical and cerebellar regions for each participant , using participant-specific segmentation and parcellation of subcortical gray matter nuclei and a network-based statistics analytical approach. The Aesthetic Interests subcluster of the Openness to Experience scale ( NEO-Five Factor Inventory; NEO-FFI) was used to characterize individual differences in aesthetic engagement and chill<symptom>. Participants reporting higher aesthetic engagement , particularly proneness to aesthetic chill<symptom> responses , exhibited significantly higher connectivity between the default network and sensory and motor cortices , higher connectivity between the ventral default and salience networks , and decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and somatomotor cortex. Current findings suggest that greater integration of the default mode network , involving processing of internal narrative , with neural representations of sensory perception and salience detection may be a mechanism underlying individual differences in aesthetic engagement. Thus , these individual differences may reflect general integration of environmental perception with internal emotional experience , which in turn may facilitate comfort with novelty , self-regulation , and positive adaptation to potentially stressful experiences.
