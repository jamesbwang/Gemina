  Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK) and its close paralogue , proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 ( PYK2) , are key regulators of aggressive spreading and metastasis of cancer cells. While targeted small-molecule inhibitors of FAK and PYK2 have been found to have promising antitumor activity , their clinical long-term efficacy may be undermined by the strong capacity of cancer cells to evade anti-kinase drugs. In healthy cells , the expression and/or function of FAK and PYK2 is tightly controlled via modulation of gene expression , competing alternatively spliced forms , non-coding RNAs , and proteins that directly or indirectly affect kinase activation or protein stability. The molecular factors involved in this control are frequently deregulated in cancer cells. Here , we review the endogenous mechanisms controlling FAK and PYK2 , and with particular focus on how these mechanisms could inspire or improve anticancer therapies.
