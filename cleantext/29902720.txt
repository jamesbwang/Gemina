  Bromodomain and plant homeodomain ( PHD) finger containing protein 1 ( BRPF1) is a member of subfamily IV of the human bromodomains. Experimental evidence suggests that BRPF1 is involved in leukemia<disease>. In a previous high-throughput docking campaign we identified several chemotypes targeting the BRPF1 bromodomain. Here , pharmacophore searches using the binding modes of two of these chemotypes resulted in two new series of ligands of the BRPF1 bromodomain. The 2,3-dioxo-quinoxaline 21 exhibits a 2-Î¼M affinity for the BRPF1 bromodomain in two different competition binding assays , and more than 100-fold selectivity for BRPF1 against other members of subfamily IV and representatives of other subfamilies. Cellular activity is confirmed by a viability assay in a leukemia<disease> cell line. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements reveal enthalpy-driven binding for compounds 21 , 26 ( K
