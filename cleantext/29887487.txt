  The patient-centered medical home ( PCMH) has emerged as an optimal primary care model for all youth; however , little is known about the extent to which adolescents in need of mental health ( MH) treatment receive care consistent with the PCMH. This study assessed ( 1) 10-year trends in PCMH care among U.S. adolescents according to MH need and ( 2) variations in PCMH care and its subcomponents among adolescents with MH need , by individual and family characteristics. This was a secondary analysis of Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data ( 2004-2013). The sample included adolescents aged 12-17 years with â‰¥ 1 office-based visits in the past year ( N = 18,717). Questions assessing a usual source of care and care that is accessible , comprehensive , family-centered , and compassionate were used to define PCMH care. For adolescents with MH needs , multivariable logistic regression was used to describe the association between PCMH care and sample characteristics. Fifty percent of adolescents experienced PCMH care , with little change between 2004 and 2013. Adolescents with MH need ( N = 3,794) had significantly lower odds of experiencing PCMH care compared with those without MH need ( odds ratio , .78; 95 % confidence interval , .69-.87). Among adolescents with MH needs , being uninsured and living with a parent who did not graduate high school were negatively associated with PCMH care , whereas parental usual source of care was positively associated ( odds ratio , 1.69; 95 % confidence interval , 1.28-2.22). Increasing care accessibility , integrating MH services into primary care settings , and targeting socioeconomically disadvantaged subgroups could improve rates of PCMH care among adolescents with MH needs.
