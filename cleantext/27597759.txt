  USP30 is an integral protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane that counteracts PINK1 and Parkin-dependent mitophagy following acute mitochondrial depolarisation. Here , we use two distinct mitophagy reporter systems to reveal tonic suppression by USP30 , of a PINK1-dependent component of basal mitophagy in cells lacking detectable Parkin. We propose that USP30 acts upstream of PINK1 through modulation of PINK1-substrate availability and thereby determines the potential for mitophagy initiation. We further show that a fraction of endogenous USP30 is independently targeted to peroxisomes where it regulates basal pexophagy in a PINK1- and Parkin-independent manner. Thus , we reveal a critical role of USP30 in the clearance of the two major sources of ROS in mammalian cells and in the regulation of both a PINK1-dependent and a PINK1-independent selective autophagy pathway.
