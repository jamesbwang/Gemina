  The cullin-RING ligase ( CRL)- NEDD8 pathway maintains essential cellular processes , including cell cycle progression , apoptosis , autophagy , DNA repair , antigen processing and signal transduction. Growing evidence demonstrates that the alteration of the CRL-NEDD8 pathway in some cancers constitutes an attractive target for therapeutic intervention , but the roles of CRL-NEDD8 pathway in acute promyelocytic leukemia<disease> ( APL) is still unclear. In the present study , we found that ATRA could decrease the expression of NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 ( NAE1) and inhibit the neddylation of cullin1 and cullin3 in the APL cell line NB4. Inactivation of cullin neddylation promoted self-degradation of F-box proteins ( Skp2 , KLHL20 , Î²TrCP) and up-regulated the protein expression of p27
