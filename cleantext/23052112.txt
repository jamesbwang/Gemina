  Patients with an anterior cruciate ligament-deficient varus-angulated knee may need not only an isolated high tibial osteotomy ( HTO) , but also an additional anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR). A number of prospective clinical trials have been published considering the combination of HTO and ACL reconstruction. Our aim was to investigate whether one-stage combined HTO and ACL reconstruction is an effective , well-established technique with long-term results in the treatment of varus-angulated knees with ACL deficiency. A systematic review was conducted by two independent reviewers by searching the MEDLINE/PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. These databases were queried with the term ` combined high tibial osteotomy anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ' and ` simultaneous high tibial osteotomy anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction '. From the initial 41 studies we finally chose and assessed 6 studies were eligible according to our inclusion-exclusion criteria. The vast majority of the patients were treated with hamstrings autograft ( 85.6 % of the patients) , whereas a small minority had a patellar Bone-to-Bone autograft ( 12.8 % of the patients) and 3 patients received a patellar allograft. High tibial open wedge osteotomy was performed in 116 patients ( 57.4 %) and closed wedge in 86 patients ( 42.6 %). The mean pre-operative angle of the patients included in our review was 6.6 ยบ varus , while the mean final post-operative angle was found to be 1.3 ยบ valgus. All 6 studies illustrated improved post-operative IKDC with the use of one-stage HTO and ACLR , whereas the reoperation rate was very low. Despite the lack of high quality studies , it seems that one-stage HTO and ACLR is a safe and effective procedure for treatment of patients suffering from symptomatic varus osteoarthritis in combination with anterior knee instability.
