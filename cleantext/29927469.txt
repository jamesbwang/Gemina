  This systematic review and meta-analysis was made to measure risk factors for retinal redetachment ( re-RD) after silicone oil removal ( SOR) in a quantitative method. A comprehensive literature review relating to risk factors for re-RD after SOR was conducted before March 2017. Odds ratio ( OR) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI) was calculated after data combination. Sixteen studies were included , and risk factors with significant differences found between the re-RD and control groups are as follows: aphakic eye ( OR = 1.50) , high myopia ( OR = 2.47) , previous failed retinal surgery ( OR = 1.71) , and ocular trauma ( OR = 3.52). Peripheral 360 ° laser retinopexy ( OR = 0.40) and scleral encircling band ( OR = 0.58) were found to be protective factors of re-RD after SOR. Aphakic eye , high myopia , previous failed retinal surgery , ocular trauma , lack of 360 ° laser , and scleral encircling band were possible risk factors relating to the occurrence of re-RD after SOR.
