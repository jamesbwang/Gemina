  Hypothermia<symptom> is currently the only approved therapy for global cerebral ischemia ( GCI) after cardiac arrest; however , it unfortunately has multiple adverse effects. As a noninvasive procedure , photobiomodulation ( PBM) therapy has emerged as a potential novel treatment for brain injury. PBM involves the use of low-level laser light therapy to influence cell behavior. In this study , we evaluated the therapeutic effects of PBM treatment with an 808-nm diode laser initiated 6 h after GCI. It was noted that PBM dose-dependently protected against GCI-induced neuronal death in the vulnerable hippocampal CA1 subregion. Functional assessments demonstrated that PBM markedly preserved both short-term ( a week) and long-term ( 6 months) spatial learning and memory function following GCI. Further mechanistic studies revealed that PBM post-treatment ( a) preserved healthy mitochondrial dynamics and suppressed substantial mitochondrial fragmentation of CA1 neurons , by reducing the detrimental Drp1 GTPase activity and its interactions with adaptor proteins Mff and Fis1 and by balancing mitochondrial targeting fission and fusion protein levels; ( b) reduced mitochondrial oxidative damage and excessive mitophagy and restored mitochondrial overall health status and preserved mitochondrial function; and ( c) suppressed mitochondria-dependent apoptosome formation/caspase -3/ 9 apoptosis-processing activities. Additionally , we validated , in an in vitro ischemia model , that cytochrome c oxidase served as a key PBM target for mitochondrial function preservation and neuroprotection. Our findings suggest that PBM serves as a promising therapeutic strategy for the functional recovery after GCI , with mechanisms involving PBM 's preservation on mitochondrial dynamics and functions and the inhibition of delayed apoptotic neuronal death in GCI.
