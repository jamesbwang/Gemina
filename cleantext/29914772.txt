  Parasites have developed a variety of strategies for invading hosts and escaping their immune response. A common mechanism by which parasites escape nitric oxide ( NO) toxicity is the activation of host arginase. This activation leads to a depletion of l-arginine , which is the substrate for NO synthase , resulting in lower levels of NO and increased production of polyamines that are necessary for parasite growth and differentiation. For this reason , small molecule inhibitors for arginase show promise as new anti-parasitic chemotherapeutics. However , few arginase inhibitors have been reported. Here , we describe the discovery of novel irreversible arginase inhibitors , and their characterization using biochemical , kinetic , and structural studies. Importantly , we determined the site on human arginase that is labeled by one of the small molecule inhibitors. The tandem mass spectra data show that the inhibitor occupies the enzyme active site and forms a covalent bond with Thr135 of arginase. These findings pave the way for the development of more potent and selective irreversible arginase inhibitors.
