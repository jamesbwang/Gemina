  The study evaluated small-scale dairy systems with continuous grazing of pastures based on three temperate grasses festulolium ( FL) , tall fescue ( TF) , and perennial ryegrass ( RG) , compared with subtropical kikuyu grass ( KG). All pastures were associated with white clover ( Trifolium repens<pathogen> L.). Twelve multiparous Holstein cows were assigned to a 4 Ã— 4 Latin square replicated three times with 14-day experimental periods. Sampling and analyses of pastures , concentrates , and animal variables followed standard procedures. FL showed a significantly ( p < 0.05) higher mean sward height , but there were no differences ( p > 0.05) in net herbage accumulation. There were significant differences ( p < 0.05) among pastures for CP , NDF , ADF , in vitro digestibility of OM ( IVOMD) , and estimated metabolizable energy ( eME). There were no differences ( p > 0.05) between treatments for milk yield and composition , live weight , or body condition score. There were significant differences ( p < 0.05) in fatty acid values for pastures in C14: 0 , C16: 1 , and C18: 3n3. There were significant differences between treatments ( p < 0.05) in milk contents for C18: 0 , C18: 1t11 , and C18: 2c9t11. Grazing FL , TF , RG , or KY pastures showed no differences in milk yields. Higher values for C18: 0 , C18: 1t11 , and C18: 2c9t11 were detected in KY , RG , and TF. RG had significantly higher MUFA than FL and higher PUFA than TF. A value under 65 % of SFA , a ratio of n-6/ n-3 lower than 4 , and an atherogenic index of 1.7 are indicators of milk with beneficial effects for human health.
