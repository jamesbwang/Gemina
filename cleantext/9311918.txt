  In aerobically growing cells , the guanine base of RNA is oxidized to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine ( 8-oxoG) , which induces alteration in their gene expression. We previously demonstrated that the human AUF1 protein binds to 8-oxoG in RNA to induce the selective degradation of oxidized messenger RNA. We herein report that the poly ( C)- binding protein PCBP1 binds to more severely oxidized RNA to activate apoptosis-related reactions. While AUF1 binds to oligoribonucleotides carrying a single 8-oxoG , PCBP1 does not bind to such oligoribonucleotides but instead binds firmly to oligoribonucleotides in which two 8-oxoG residues are located nearby. PCBP1-deficient cells , constructed from the human HeLa S3 line using the CRISPR-Cas9 system , exhibited higher survival rates than HeLa S3 cells when small doses of hydrogen peroxide were applied. The levels of caspase-3 activation and PARP-1 cleavage in the PCBP1-deficient cells were significantly lower than those in wild-type cells. The structure-function relationship of PCBP1 was established with the use of PCBP1 mutant proteins in which the conserved KH domains were defective. Human cells appear to possess two distinct mechanisms , one controlled by AUF1 and the other by PCBP1 , with the former functioning when messenger RNA is moderately oxidized and the latter operating when the RNA is more severely damaged.
