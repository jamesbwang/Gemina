  The objective of this study was to examine wound<disease> healing in extraction sockets following ridge preservation and the outcome of implants placed in those sites. Extraction sockets ( N = 31) were grafted with anorganic bovine bone mineral ( ABBM) and covered with dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. Bone cores obtained during implant placement were examined histologically and histomorphometrically. Percentages of vital bone and residual graft were 37.5 % ± 21.3 % and 12.5 % ± 8.9 % , respectively. New vital bone showed a negative correlation with patient age. Percentage of vital bone formation in sockets was correlated with neither postgraft wound<disease> healing time nor peri-implant marginal bone level.
