  A charge designable and tunable green fluorescent protein ( GFP)- based protein delivery strategy was proposed. The acquired His29GFP selectively permeates the cell membrane at a target pH of 6.5 and escapes from the endosome efficiently. The delivered RNase A caused substantial mRNA degradation in HeLa cells , and proliferation inhibition in different cell lines and a 3D tumor model at pH 6.5.
