  Medulloblastoma ( MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Current treatment for MB consists of surgery followed by irradiation of the whole neuraxis and high-dose multi-agent chemotherapy , a partially effective strategy associated with highly invalidating side effects. Therefore , identification and validation of novel target molecules capable of contrasting MB growth without disturbing brain development is needed. Citron kinase protein ( CITK) , encoded by primary microcephaly gene MCPH17 , is required for normal proliferation and survival of neural progenitors. Constitutive loss of CITK leads to cytokinesis failure , chromosome instability , and apoptosis in the developing brain , but has limited effects on other tissues. On this basis , we hypothesized that CITK could be an effective target for MB treatment. In MB cell lines DAOY and ONS-76 , CITK knockdown increased both cytokinesis failure and DNA damage , impairing proliferation and inducing cell senescence and apoptosis via TP53 or TP73. Similar effects were obtained in the NeuroD-SmoA1 transgenic mouse model , in which CITK deletion increased apoptotic cells and senescence markers such as P21CIP1 , P27KIP1 , and P16INK4A. Most importantly , CITK deletion decreased tumor growth and increased overall survival in these mice , with no apparent side effects. These results suggest that CITK can be a useful molecular target for MB treatment.
