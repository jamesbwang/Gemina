  The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional homeostatic route of communication between both of the organs direct via receptors of the CNS or via epigenetic mechanisms of divers metabolites e.g. SCFA , GABA , β-hydroxybutyrate. Thus , a modulation of gut microbiota via nutrition , lifestyle etc. might be effective for emotional status and depressive disorders. The dietary composition has an influence on gut microbiota composition , microbial metabolite profile and the according consequences on emotional status and depression<symptom> within a system biologic approach. There are changes in gut microbiota composition and gut microbial profile ( butyrate , GABA , β-hydroxybutyrate) effecting epigenetic regulation ( histone acetylation , DNA methylation) and gene expression of receptors and mediators ( SLC6A4 , BDNF , GABA , GPRs) involved in depressive disorders.
