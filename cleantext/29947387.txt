  A catalyst bound Î±-aminoalkyl radical intermediate from iminium is developed to control its formation and reactivity with aerobic oxygen. The influence of the catalyst was demonstrated via the ease of radical intermediate formation and its subsequent reactivity , including the first catalyst-controlled enantioselective aerobic oxidation with a chiral phosphite catalyst.
