  Interfaces between donor and acceptor in a polymer solar cell play a crucial role in exciton dissociation and charge photogeneration. While the importance of charge transfer ( CT) excitons for free carrier generation is intensively studied , the effect of blending on the nature of the polymer excitons in relation to the blend nanomorphology remains largely unexplored. In this work , electroabsorption ( EA) spectroscopy is used to study the excited-state polarizability of polymer excitons in several polymer: fullerene blend systems , and it is found that excited-state polarizability of polymer excitons in the blends is a strong function of blend nanomorphology. The increase in excited-state polarizability with decreased domain size indicates that intermixing of states at the interface between the donor polymers and fullerene increases the exciton delocalization , resulting in an increase in exciton dissociation efficiency. This conclusion is further supported by transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements , along with the results from time-dependent density functional theory calculations. These findings indicate that polymer excited-state polarizability is a key parameter for efficient free carrier generation and should be considered in the design and development of high-performance polymer solar cells.
