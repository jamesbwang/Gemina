  Nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots ( N-GQDs) were synthesized to explore and extend their potential applications in biomedical field. The hemocompatibility and cytotoxity of the obtained N-GQDs were primarily assessed at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μg/ml. From the results , it was found that the proliferation of rat Bone Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( rBMSCs) was depressed to a certain extent after incubating with the high concentration ( 100 μg/ml) of N-GQDs. The nanoscale size and superior dispersibility endow N-GQDs with good cell permeability. Meanwhile , owing to their intrinsic photoluminescence characteristic , the N-GQDs can be used to label cells with high uniformity and light stability in absence of chemical dyes. More importantly , the up-regulated expression of alkaline phosphate ( ALP) , extracellular matrix , osteopontin ( OPN) and osteocalcin ( OCN) in rBMSCs cultured with N-GQDs , indicating N-GQDs have the abilities to promote rBMSCs osteogenic differentiation. This work would help give a new insight into the advantages of N-GQDs and pave the way for application of N-GQDs in regenerative medicine fields.
