  Scaled Subprofile Model of Principal Component Analysis ( SSM-PCA) is a multivariate statistical method and has been widely used in Positron Emission Tomography ( PET). Recently , SSM-PCA has been applied to discriminate patients with Parkinson 's disease and healthy controls with Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation ( ALFF) from Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( RS-fMRI). As RS-fMRI scans are more readily available than PET scans , it is important to investigate the intra- and inter-scanner reliability of SSM-PCA in RS-fMRI. A RS-fMRI dataset with Eyes Open ( EO) and Eyes Closed ( EC) conditions was obtained in 21 healthy subjects ( 21.8 Â± 1.8 years old , 11 females) on 3 visits ( V1 , V2 , and V3) , with V1 and V2 ( mean interval of 14 days apart) on one scanner and V3 ( about 8 months from V2) on a different scanner. To simulate between-group analysis in conventional SSM-PCA studies , 21 subjects were randomly divided into two groups , i.e. , EC-EO group ( EC ALFF map minus EO ALFF map ,
