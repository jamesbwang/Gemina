  Reporting clinical features of the late course of the disease after long-term follow-up in a bilaterally affected patient with idiopathic retinitis , vasculitis , retinal aneurysms<disease> and neuroretinitis ( IRVAN) and new peripheral retinal findings on wide-field angiography and multimodal imaging. This was a retrospective observational study , based on current diagnostic studies including wide-field fluorescein angiography , optical coherence tomography ( OCT) and treatment of aneurysms<disease> with argon laser photocoagulation. A 21-year-old female with bilateral IRVAN syndrome-stage 2 in the right eye and stage 3 in the left eye-previously treated bilaterally with laser photocoagulation for retinal macroaneurysms and ischemic areas between 1985 and 1992. Follow-up interrupted on two occasions , with subsequent fundus re-examinations confirming the prevention of retinal neovascularization in both eyes , as recently evidenced on wide-field angiography. A case of bilateral IRVAN disease with multiple retinal aneurysms<disease> , neuroretinitis and peripheral capillary nonperfusion successfully treated with laser photocoagulation , maintaining normal visual acuity in one eye and preventing retinal neovascular complications.
