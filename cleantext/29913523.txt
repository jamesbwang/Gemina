  As dental imaging accounts for approximately 40 % of all X-ray examinations in Germany , profound knowledge of this topic is essential not only for the dentist but also for the clinical radiologist. This review focuses on basic imaging findings regarding the teeth. Therefore , tooth structure , currently available imaging techniques and common findings in conserving dentistry including endodontology , periodontology , implantology and dental trauma are presented. Literature research on the current state of dental radiology was performed using Pubmed. Currently , the most frequent imaging techniques are the orthopantomogram ( OPG) and single-tooth radiograph , as well as computer tomography ( CT) and cone beam CT mainly for implantology ( planning or postoperative control) or trauma indications. Especially early diagnosis and correct classification of a dental trauma , such as dental pulp involvement , prevents from treatment delays or worsening of therapy options and prognosis. Furthermore , teeth are commonly a hidden focus of infection.Since radiologists are frequently confronted with dental imaging , either concerning a particular question such as a trauma patient or regarding incidental findings throughout head and neck imaging , further training in this field is more than worthwhile to facilitate an early and sufficient dental treatment. · This review focuses on dental imaging techniques and the most important pathologies.. · Dental pathologies may not only be locally but also systemically relevant.. · Reporting of dental findings is important for best patient care.. · Masthoff M , Gerwing M , Masthoff M et al..
