  Using silver nanobelts and silver microflakes in a DGEBA/TETA epoxy matrix , we sought to investigate the relationship between the evolving electrical resistivity of formulations of hybrid nanocomposites during the curing process. This was characterized using three methods: ( i) in situ four-wire electrical resistance measurements; ( ii) differential scanning calorimetry , and ( iii) dilatometry. In a previous work we reported that the resistivity of microcomposites was strongly affected by partial vitrification during curing. In this study , the reported vitrification effect is observed again , further validating the concern of far-ranging implications on the industry practices. The addition of silver nanobelts greatly improved conductivity of the composites , though it was observed that the improvements are often lost during subsequent heating and cooling cycles. Resistivity observations indicate that the sensitivity may be due to insufficient nanobelt-nanobelt contacts in the composite , and thus further increasing the nanobelt fraction of the filler content can maximize conductivity.
