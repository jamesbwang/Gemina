  Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MPK) cascades play important roles in plant development , immune signaling and stress responses. MPK4 was initially identified as a negative regulator in systemic acquired resistance ( SAR) because the levels of salicylic acid ( SA) and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) were higher in the Arabidopsis mpk4 mutant. MPK4 is highly expressed in guard cells , specialized epidermal cells forming stomatal pores on leaf surface that function at the frontline of bacterial pathogen invasion. In addition to biotic stresses , stomatal guard cells also mediate cellular responses to abiotic stimuli such as drought and CO
