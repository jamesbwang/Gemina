  Neuroinflammation is a key factor of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and other neurodegenerative conditions. Microglia are the resident mononuclear immune cells of the central nervous system ( CNS). They play an essential role in the maintenance of homeostasis and responses to neuroinflammation. Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 is one of the most commonly used natural medicines owing to its established efficacy and remarkable biological activities especially in respect to CNS diseases. However , only few studies have addressed the effects and mechanisms of Ginkgo biloba extract in microglia activation. We measured the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines by ELISA and analyzed gene expressions by qRT-PCR and Western Blot in LPS treated cultured primary rat microglia. The Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 significantly inhibited the release of prostaglandin E Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 displayed anti-neuroinflammatory activity in LPS-activated primary microglia cells. EGb 761 was able to reduce neuroinflammatory activation by targeting the COX/PGE
