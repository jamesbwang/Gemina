  Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of all common gynaecological malignancies in women worldwide. Ovarian cancer comprises of > 15 distinct tumor types and subtypes characterized by histopathological features , environmental and genetic risk factors , precursor lesions<symptom> and molecular events during oncogenesis. Recent studies on gene signature profiling of different subtypes of ovarian cancer have revealed significant genetic heterogeneity between and within each ovarian cancer histological subtype. Thus , an immense interest have shown towards a more personalized medicine for understanding the clinical and molecular complexities of four major types of epithelial ovarian cancer ( serous , endometrioid , clear cell , and mucinous). As such , further in depth studies are needed for identification of molecular signalling network complexities associated with effective prognostication and targeted therapies to prevent or treat metastasis. Therefore , understanding the metastatic potential of primary ovarian cancer and therapeutic interventions against lethal ovarian cancer for the development of personalized therapies is very much indispensable. Consequently , in this review we have updated the key dysregulated genes of four major subtypes of epithelial carcinomas. We have also highlighted the recent advances and current challenges in unravelling the complexities of the origin of tumor as well as genetic heterogeneity of ovarian cancer.
