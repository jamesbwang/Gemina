  Sex determination in mammals is strongly linked to sex chromosomes. In most cases , females possess two copies of X chromosome while males have one X and one Y chromosome. It is assumed that these chromosomes originated from a pair of homologous autosomes , which diverged when recombination between them was suppressed. However , it is still debated why the sex chromosomes stopped recombining and how this process spread out over most part of the chromosomes. To study this problem , we developed a simulation model , in which the recombination rate between the sex chromosomes can freely evolve. We found that the suppression of recombination between the X and Y is spontaneous and proceeds very quickly during the evolution of population , which leads to the degeneration of the Y in males. Interestingly , the degeneration happens only when mating pairs are unfaithful. This evolutionary strategy purifies the X chromosome from defective alleles and leads to the larger number of females than males in the population. In consequence , the reproductive potential of the whole population increases. Our results imply that both the suppression of recombination and the degeneration of Y chromosome may be associated with reproductive strategy and favoured in polygamous populations with faithless mating partners.
