  We present a proof of concept that machine learning techniques can be used to predict the properties of CNOHF energetic molecules from their molecular structures. We focus on a small but diverse dataset consisting of 109 molecular structures spread across ten compound classes. Up until now , candidate molecules for energetic materials have been screened using predictions from expensive quantum simulations and thermochemical codes. We present a comprehensive comparison of machine learning models and several molecular featurization methods- sum over bonds , custom descriptors , Coulomb matrices , Bag of Bonds , and fingerprints. The best featurization was sum over bonds ( bond counting) , and the best model was kernel ridge regression. Despite having a small data set , we obtain acceptable errors and Pearson correlations for the prediction of detonation pressure , detonation velocity , explosive energy , heat of formation , density , and other properties out of sample. By including another dataset with â‰ˆ 300 additional molecules in our training we show how the error can be pushed lower , although the convergence with number of molecules is slow. Our work paves the way for future applications of machine learning in this domain , including automated lead generation and interpreting machine learning models to obtain novel chemical insights.
