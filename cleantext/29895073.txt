  Gastroparesis is a functional disorder with a variety of symptoms that is characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. A recent series of retrospective studies has demonstrated that peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy ( G-POEM) is a promising endoscopic procedure for treating patients with refractory gastroparesis. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the feasibility , safety , and efficacy of G-POEM. 20 patients with refractory gastroparesis ( 10 diabetic and 10 nondiabetic) were prospectively included in the trial. Patients were treated by G-POEM after evaluation of pyloric function using an endoscopic functional luminal imaging probe. Clinical responses were evaluated using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index ( GCSI) , and quality of life was assessed using the Patient Assessment of Upper<symptom> Gastrointestinal Disorders- Quality of Life scale and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index scores. Gastric emptying was measured using 4-hour scintigraphy before G-POEM and at 3 months. Feasibility of the procedure was 100 %. Compared with baseline values , G-POEM significantly improved symptoms ( GCSI: 1.3 vs. 3.5; G-POEM was efficacious and safe for treating refractory gastroparesis , especially in patients with low pyloric distensibility.
