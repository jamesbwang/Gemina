  Entropy calculation is an important step in the postprocessing of molecular dynamics trajectories or predictive models. In recent years the nearest neighbor method has emerged as a powerful method to deal in a flexible way with the dimensionality of the problem. Here we provide two programs , PBD2ENTROPY and PDB2TRENT that compute the conformational and translational-rotational entropy , respectively , based on the nearest neighbor method. PDB2ENTROPY takes in input two files containing the following: ( 1) conformational ensembles of the same molecule ( s) in PDB format and ( 2) definitions of torsion angles ( a default file is provided where additional user definitions can be easily implemented). PDB2TRENT takes in a file containing samples of the complexed molecules , a string specifying atoms providing the reference framework to superimpose samples , and a string specifying atoms used to compute rotation and translation of one molecule with respect to the other. The C programs and sample demonstration data are available on the GitHub repository ( URL: http://github.com/federico-fogolari/pdb2entropy and http://github.com/federico-fogolari/pdb2trent).
