  This study evaluates a novel bronchodilator , S1226 , for its efficacy in reversing allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in subjects with mild , allergic asthma. S1226 is a new class of bronchodilator that is an aerosol/vapor/gas mixture combining pharmacological and biophysical principles for a novel mode of action. It contains a potent bronchodilator gas ( carbon dioxide or CO This was a phase IIa proof-of-concept , placebo-controlled , randomized , double-blind , crossover single-dose clinical trial to evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of S1226 ( 8 % CO No significant safety issues were observed. All adverse events were non-serious , mild , and transient. There was a statistically significant decrease in peripheral blood oxygenation levels over time in the placebo group following allergen inhalation , whereas blood oxygenation was maintained at normal levels in the S1226-treated subjects ( P = 0.028). This effect was greatest 5 min after start of treatment ( P < 0.001). The recovery rate was faster but not significantly so ( P = 0.272) for S1226 compared to the placebo at earlier time points ( 5 , 10 , and 15 min) , as assessed by â‰¥ 12 % reversal of FEV S1226 was safe , tolerated well , and provided bronchodilation and improved blood oxygenation in subjects with mild atopic asthma following allergen-induced bronchoconstriction. Additional studies to optimize the therapeutic response are indicated. ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02334553. Registered on 12 November 2014.
