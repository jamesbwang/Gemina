  The objective of this study was to examine whether implementation of a stepwise multicomponent intervention ( STA OP!) for challenging behavior and pain affects quality of life ( QoL) of nursing home residents with moderate to severe dementia after 3 and 6 months. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 12 nursing homes. Both control ( n = 140) and intervention group ( = 148) received training , the intervention group was also treated using the STA OP! At baseline , 3 and 6 months QoL was assessed using the 6 QUALIDEM domains applicable to moderate and severe dementia. Linear mixed models were used to compare changes in QoL domains between the 2 groups over time. After both 3 and 6 months , there was no change , and no difference in change , between the 2 groups in the domains Care relationship , Positive affect , Negative affect , and Social relations. Between 0 and 3 months , a positive effect was seen in the domain Restless tense behavior with a regression coefficient of β: 0.95 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.36-1.54). Between 3 and 6 months , a negative effect was seen on the domain Restless tense behavior β: -0.98 ( 95 % CI , -1.60 to -0.36) and a positive effect in the domain Social isolation , β: 0.64 ( 95 % CI , 0.12-1.17). The stepwise intervention STA OP! affects the QUALIDEM domains in different ways: there was a lowering of Restless tense behavior in the short term , which reverted back to the initial level in the longer term , and a lowering of Social isolation in the longer term.
