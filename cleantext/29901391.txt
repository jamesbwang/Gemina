  The behavior of acetonitrile/sodium 1,4-bis ( 2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate ( AOT)/ n-heptane microemulsion , whether it remains as reverse micelle ( RM) or bicontinuous microemulsion ( BMC) , has been controversial and even termed as a `` problem system ''. Herein , we investigate the microemulsion using spectral and dynamical responses of a hydrophilic solvatochromic fluorophore 4-aminophthalimide ( 4-AP) at different w
