  Endometrial adenocarcinoma ( EndoCA) is the most common gynecological cancer type in the US , and its incidence is increasing. The majority of patients are disease-free after surgical resection of stage I tumors , which is often followed by radiation therapy , but most patients with advanced disease recur and have a poor prognosis , largely because the tumors become refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapies. PTEN , a commonly mutated tumor suppressor in EndoCAs , is well known for its ability to inhibit the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Nuclear functions for PTEN have been proposed as well , but whether those affect EndoCA development , progression , or outcomes is not well understood. Using immunohistochemistry , nuclear PTEN expression was observed in approximately half of EndoCA patient tumors , independent of grade and cytoplasmic PTEN expression. Higher levels of the DNA damage response ( DDR) marker , yH2AX , were observed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in human EndoCA tumor sections that were PTEN-negative , in murine EndoCA tissues that were genetically modified to be PTEN-null , and in Ishikawa EndoCA cells , which do not express endogenous PTEN. Over-expression of exogenous PTEN-WT or PTEN-NLS , a modified PTEN with an added nuclear localization signal , significantly improved both DDR and G2/M transition in Ishikawa cells treated with a DNA damaging agent. Whereas PARP inhibition with Olaparib was not as effective in Ishikawa cells expressing native or PTEN-NLS , inhibition with Talazoparib was not affected by PTEN overexpression. These results suggest that nuclear PTEN subcellular localization in human EndoCA could be diagnostic when considering DDR therapeutic intervention.
