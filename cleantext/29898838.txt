  Residual and significant postinfarction left ventricular ( LV) dysfunction , despite technically successful percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) , remains an important clinical issue. In preclinical models , low-dose insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1) has potent cytoprotective and positive cardiac remodeling effects. We studied the safety and efficacy of immediate post-PCI low-dose intracoronary IGF1 infusion in STEMI patients. Using a double-blind , placebo-controlled , multidose study design , we randomized 47 STEMI patients with significantly reduced ( ≤ 40 %) LV ejection fraction ( LVEF) after successful PCI to single intracoronary infusion of placebo ( n = 15) , 1.5 ng IGF1 ( n = 16) , or 15 ng IGF1 ( n = 16). All received optimal medical therapy. Safety end points were freedom from hypoglycemia , hypotension<symptom> , or significant arrhythmias within 1 hour of therapy. The primary efficacy end point was LVEF , and secondary end points were LV volumes , mass , stroke volume , and infarct size at 2-month follow-up , all assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment effects were estimated by analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline ( 24 hours) outcome. No significant differences in safety end points occurred between treatment groups out to 30 days ( χ In this pilot trial , low-dose IGF1 , given after optimal mechanical reperfusion in STEMI , is safe but does not improve LVEF. However , there is a signal for a dose-dependent benefit on post-MI remodeling that may warrant further study.
