  Novel wide band gaps and magnetism in ordered titanium-vanadium , titanium-chromium , and titanium-manganese carbide and nitride based MXenes are predicted using density functional theory. Based on the recent synthesis of Ti centred double transition metal MXenes , we study MXenes with a central Ti layer and different surface early 3d metals , and various terminations , TiM2X2T ( M = V , Cr , Mn; X = C , N; T = H , F , O , OH). While previously studied MXenes are strongly metallic , we predict surface metal and termination dependent metal-insulator transitions in the Cr-N and Mn-N series. A uniquely wide band gap over 1 eV is predicted for TiMn2N2F2 using the HSE06 density functional while the unterminated TiMn2N2 remains metallic. The entire TiCr2C2T series is predicted to be semiconducting. Distinct from the more common Ti-C MXenes , not all combinations of metals and terminations are predicted to be stable. Within the examined sets of materials , anti-ferromagnetic orders are generally most favorable. The new MXenes further extend the range of properties accessible in this family of two-dimensional nanomaterials.
