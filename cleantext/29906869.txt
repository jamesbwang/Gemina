  We introduce the threshold q-voter opinion dynamics where an agent , facing a binary choice , can change its mind when at least q _ ( 0) among q neighbors share the opposite opinion. Otherwise , the agent can still change its mind with a certain probability ɛ. This threshold dynamics contemplates the possibility of persuasion by an influence group even when there is not full agreement among its members. In fact , individuals can follow their peers not only when there is unanimity ( q _ ( 0) = q) in the lobby group , as assumed in the q-voter model , but also , depending on the circumstances , when there is simple majority ( q _ ( 0) > q/2) , Byzantine consensus ( q _ ( 0) > 2q/3) , or any minimal number q _ ( 0) among q. This realistic threshold gives place to emerging collective states and phase transitions which are not observed in the standard q voter. The threshold q _ ( 0) , together with the stochasticity introduced by ɛ , yields a phenomenology that mimics as particular cases the q voter with stochastic drivings such as nonconformity and independence. In particular , nonconsensus majority states are possible , as well as mixed phases. Continuous and discontinuous phase transitions can occur , but also transitions from fluctuating phases into absorbing states.
