  Regulating the air in low-oxygen environments protects hermetically stored grains from storage pests damage. However , pests that can tolerate hypoxic stress pose a huge challenge in terms of grain storage. We used various biological approaches to determine the fundamental mechanisms of Tribolium castaneum to cope with hypoxia. Our results indicated that limiting the available oxygen to T. castaneum increased glycolysis and inhibited the Krebs cycle , and that accumulated pyruvic acid was preferentially converted to lactic acid via anaerobic metabolism. Mitochondrial aerobic respiration<symptom> was markedly suppressed for beetles under hypoxia , which also might have led to mitochondrial autophagy. The enzymatic activity of citrate synthase decreased in insects under hypoxia but recovered within 12 h , which suggested that the beetles recovered from the hypoxia. Moreover , hypoxia-reperfusion resulted in severe oxidative damage to insects , and antioxidant levels increased to defend against the high level of reactive oxygen species. In conclusion , our findings show that mitochondria were the main target in T. castaneum in response to low oxygen. The beetles under hypoxia inhibited mitochondrial respiration<symptom> and increased antioxidant activity after reoxygenation. Our research advances the field of pest control and makes it possible to develop more efficient strategies for hermetic storage.
