  Depending on the environmental conditions , cells adapt their metabolism and specific growth rate. Rearrangements occur on many different levels such as macromolecular composition , gene and protein expression , morphology and metabolic flux patterns. As the interplay of these processes also determines the output of a recombinant protein producing system , having control over specific growth rate of the culture is advantageous. Continuous culture methods were developed to grow cells in a constant environment and have been used for decades to study basic microbial physiology in a controlled and reproducible manner. Our review summarizes the uses of continuous cultures in cell physiology studies and process development , with a focus on recombinant protein-producing microorganisms.
