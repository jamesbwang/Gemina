  Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological malignancy in women and identification of new therapeutic targets is essential for the continued development of therapy for ovarian cancer. TRRAP ( transformation/transcription domain-associated protein) is an adaptor protein and a component of histone acetyltransferase complex. The present study was undertaken to investigate the roles played by TRRAP in the proliferation and tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer stem cells. TRRAP expression was found to be up-regulated in the sphere cultures of A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of TRRAP significantly decreased cell proliferation and the number of A2780 spheroids. In addition , TRRAP knockdown induced cell cycle arrest and increased apoptotic percentages of A2780 sphere cells. Notably , the mRNA levels of stemness-associated markers , that is , OCT4 , SOX2 , and NANOG , were suppressed in TRRAP-silenced A2780 sphere cells. In addition , TRRAP overexpression increased the mRNA level of NANOG and the transcriptional activity of NANOG promoter in these cells. Furthermore , TRRAP knockdown significantly reduced tumor growth in a murine xenograft transplantation model. Taken together , the findings of the present study suggest that TRRAP plays an important role in the regulation of the proliferation and stemness of ovarian cancer stem cells.
