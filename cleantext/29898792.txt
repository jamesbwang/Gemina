  Unicellular flagellates of the family Trypanosomatidae are obligatory parasites of invertebrates , vertebrates and plants. Dixenous species are aetiological agents of a number of diseases in humans , domestic animals and plants. Their monoxenous relatives are restricted to insects. Because of the high biological diversity , adaptability to dramatically different environmental conditions , and omnipresence , these protists have major impact on all biotic communities that still needs to be fully elucidated. In addition , as these organisms represent a highly divergent evolutionary lineage , they are strikingly different from the common ` model system ' eukaryotes , such as some mammals , plants or fungi<pathogen> A number of excellent reviews , published over the past decade , were dedicated to specialized topics from the areas of trypanosomatid molecular and cell biology , biochemistry , host-parasite relationships or other aspects of these fascinating organisms. However , there is a need for a more comprehensive review that summarizing recent advances in the studies of trypanosomatids in the last 30 years , a task , which we tried to accomplish with the current paper.
