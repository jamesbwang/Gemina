  Myricitrin is a natural occurring flavonoid glycoside that possesses effects on inhibiting nitric oxide ( NO) transmission and preventing inflammatory reaction. Although previous study showed the myricitrin possesses antibone loss effects via reducing the expression of IL-6 and partially suppressing reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production. However , the effects of myricitrin on nuclear factor-kappaB ligand ( RANKL)- stimulated osteoclastogenesis have not yet been further investigated. The current study was aimed to demonstrating the inhibitory effects of myricitrin on RANKL-stimulated osteoclastogenesis and relevant mechanisms. We found myricitrin significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis suggesting that it may acts on RANKL/RANK induced downstream signal cross cascading in osteoclast precursors. In that , our Western blotting results showed myricitrin significantly attenuated RNAKL/MAPKs ( phosphorylation of p38 , ERK , JNK) and AKT signal cascading. Complementing previous study , our results suggesting as a natural inhibitor , myricitrin possesses the potential therapeutic effects on inflammatory osteolysis.
