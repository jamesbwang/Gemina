  Models remain our best available tool for managing low lake dissolved oxygen concentrations , which pose a serious ecological risk. This study investigated whether process-based catchment models ( INCA-N and INCA-P) could accurately drive a lake model ( PROTECH) , to bridge a gap between terrestrial , riverine and limnological research. INCA was calibrated over all 20 catchments of the Simcoe watershed , Canada. Daily outputs ( flow , nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations) over the period 2010-2016 were selected for a common `` baseline '' period , and used as inputs to PROTECH , which was calibrated across the three major basins of lake Simcoe; Kempenfelt ( K42) , Cooks ( C9) , and the main basin ( E51). Results showed that at catchment outflows INCA models achieved an average flow R
