  We investigate the nonequilibrium stationary states of systems consisting of chemical reactions among molecules of several chemical species. To this end , we introduce and develop a stochastic formulation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of chemical reaction systems based on a master equation defined on the space of microscopic chemical states and on appropriate definitions of entropy and entropy production. The system is in contact with a heat reservoir and is placed out of equilibrium by the contact with particle reservoirs. In our approach , the fluxes of various types , such as the heat and particle fluxes , play a fundamental role in characterizing the nonequilibrium chemical state. We show that the rate of entropy production in the stationary nonequilibrium state is a bilinear form in the affinities and the fluxes of reaction , which are expressed in terms of rate constants and transition rates , respectively. We also show how the description in terms of microscopic states can be reduced to a description in terms of the numbers of particles of each species , from which follows the chemical master equation. As an example , we calculate the rate of entropy production of the first and second Schl√∂gl reaction models.
