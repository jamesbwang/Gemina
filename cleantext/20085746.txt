  Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD) is an important cofactor that regulates various biological processes , including metabolism and gene expression. As a coenzyme , NAD controls mitochondrial respiration<symptom> through enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA) cycle , Î²-oxidation , and oxidative phosphorylation and also serves as a substrate for posttranslational protein modifications , such as deacetylation and ADP-ribosylation by sirtuins and poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP) , respectively. Many studies have demonstrated that NAD levels decrease with aging and that these declines cause various aging-associated diseases. In contrast , activation of NAD metabolism prevents declines in NAD levels during aging. In particular , dietary supplementation with NAD precursors has been associated with protection against age-associated insulin resistance. However , it remains unclear which NAD synthesis pathway is important and/or efficient at increasing NAD levels in vivo. In this study , Nmnat3 overexpression in mice efficiently increased NAD levels in various tissues and prevented aging-related declines in NAD levels. We also demonstrated that Nmnat3-overexpressing ( Nmnat3 Tg) mice were protected against diet-induced and aging-associated insulin resistance. Moreover , in skeletal muscles of Nmnat3 Tg mice , TCA cycle activity was significantly enhanced , and the energy source for oxidative phosphorylation was shifted toward fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation was significantly suppressed in aged Nmnat3 Tg mice. Interestingly , we also found that concentrations of the NAD analog nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide ( NGD) were dramatically increased in Nmnat3 Tg mice. These results suggest that Nmnat3 overexpression improves metabolic health and that Nmnat3 is an attractive therapeutic target for metabolic disorders that are caused by aging.
