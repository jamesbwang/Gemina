  We investigated whether the outcome of revascularization differed from the outcome of medical therapy in chronic kidney disease ( CKD) and non-CKD patients with chronic total occlusion ( CTO). Methods and Results: A total of 2,010 patients with CTO who underwent revascularization ( n = 1,355) , including percutaneous coronary intervention ( n = 878) and coronary artery bypass grafting ( n = 477) , or had medical therapy alone ( n = 655) were examined. The primary outcome was all-cause death during follow-up. Among the non-CKD patients ( n = 1,679) , revascularization had a lower incidence of all-cause death ( adjusted hazard ratio ( HR) 0.54 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.41-0.72 , P < 0.001) compared with medical therapy. Among the CKD patients ( n = 331) , the difference in the incidence of all-cause death was not as marked between the 2 treatments ( adjusted HR 0.71 , 95 % CI 0.48-1.06 , P = 0.09). There was a significant interaction between kidney function and treatment strategy ( revascularization vs. medical therapy) on all-cause death ( P for interaction = 0.014). Based on the clinical outcomes , in CTO patients with preexisting CKD , revascularization via PCI or bypass surgery might not be as effective as in non-CKD patients.
