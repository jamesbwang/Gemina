  Early breaches in B cell tolerance are central to type 1 diabetes progression in mouse and man. Conventional BCR transgenic mouse models ( VH125.Tg NOD) reveal the power of B cell specificity to drive disease as APCs. However , in conventional fixed IgM models , comprehensive assessment of B cell development is limited. To provide more accurate insight into the developmental and functional fates of anti-insulin B cells , we generated a new NOD model ( V
