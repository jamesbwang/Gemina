  Nitric oxide ( NO) is a radical gas that reacts with various biological molecules in complex ways to inhibit growth as a bacteriostatic agent. NO is nearly ubiquitous because it can be generated both biotically and abiotically. To protect the cell from NO damage , bacteria have evolved many strategies , with the production of detoxifying enzymatic systems as most efficient. Here we report that
