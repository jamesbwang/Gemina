  In the last few decades , there has been exponential increase in studies aiming to trace the molecular mechanism of fear extinction with a hope to minimize the return of fear after exposure therapy required for operational treatment of anxiety<symptom> disorders. The present study explored how the timing of extinction training after developing a specific fear , affects the consequent return of the extinguished fear and the role of histone acetylation in controlling the circuitry , thereof. It was found that rats undergone extinction training 10 min. after fear memory acquisition ( Immediate Extinction) had deficits in retention of extinction memory as compared to one which underwent extinction 24 h after fear acquisition ( Delayed Extinction). When the differences were sorted at the circuitry level the relative activity of the infralimbic prefrontal cortex ( IL) to prelimbic cortex ( PL) was found to be lower in the immediate extinction group as compared to the delayed extinction group as evidenced by the c-fos expression in the mPFC of these groups. Further investigation showed that acetylation of histone H3/H4 along with the levels of CREB binding protein ( CBP) which is a histone acetyltransferase ( HAT) , was associated with neuronal activation and was significantly lower in the IL of the immediate extinction group than the delayed extinction group. In conclusion , the observed deficits in the immediate extinction group may be the result of compromised activation of IL , which in turn may be associated with changes in histone acetylation.
