  Myocardial strain imaging has gained popularity during the last decade in various clinical scenarios. The objective of this article was to review the potential application of two-dimensional ( 2D) and three-dimensional ( 3D) strains in patients with coronary artery disease. Reports on the diagnostic accuracy of myocardial deformation analysis using 2D and 3D speckle-tracking analyses to detect significant coronary stenosis at rest or during stress and to evaluate myocardial viability are limited. A newer 2D strain approach that uses layer-specific strain analysis might be sensitive in the detection of subtle regional myocardial dysfunction induced by myocardial ischemia. However , its potential accuracy is controversial. The regional assessment of wall motion by 2D/3D strain is not recommended because of measurement variabilities. Further studies are required for the adoption of this technology in patients with coronary artery disease.
