  Diaryliodonium salt as a stable and easily prepared reagent has been one of the most efficient arylation reagents in organic synthesis. In traditional methods , this reagent was generally applied as a single arylation source and the regenerated aryl iodide is a waste of resources. In the past five years , transition metal-catalyzed both utilization of aryls in diaryliodonium salts were well demonstrated. The purpose of the present review is to focus on various atom-economical applications of diaryliodonium salt methodologies , which were reported recently for the synthesis of functionalized molecules. The presentation is organized according to the structures of the diaryliodonium salts and the reaction components.
