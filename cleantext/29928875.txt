  Experimental evidence indicates a critical role of TRPV4 ( Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4) in controlling the cell migratory activity of multiple tumors. However , the oncogenic role of TRPV4 in glioma still remains elusive. In this study , we tried to investigate the oncogenic role of TRPV4 in glioma. We found that the expression levels of TRPV4 were upregulated in glioma and the high levels of TRPV4 indicated a worse prognosis in patients with glioma. TRPV4 was critical for glioma migration and invasion: activating TRPV4 by agonist GSK1016790 A enhanced glioma migration and invasion , while , the specific TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047 suppressed glioma migration and invasion. Mechanically , activated TRPV4 promoted the activation of Rac1 ( Ras-related C3 botulinum<pathogen> toxin substrate 1) by targeting the AKT for phosphorylation , then enhanced glioma migration and invasion. All these results suggested that TRPV4 accelerates glioma migration and invasion through the AKT/Rac1 signaling , and TRPV4 might be considered as a potential target for glioma therapy.
