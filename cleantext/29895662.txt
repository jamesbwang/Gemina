  Adolescent and young adult ( AYA) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) are recognized as a unique population with specific characteristics and needs. In adolescents age 15 to 20 years , the use of fully pediatric protocols is supported by many comparative studies of pediatric and adult cooperative groups. In young adults , growing evidence suggests that pediatric-inspired or even fully pediatric approaches may also dramatically improve outcomes , leading to long-term survival rates of almost 70 % , despite diminishing indications of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In the last decade , better knowledge of the ALL oncogenic landscape according to age distribution and minimal residual disease assessments has improved risk stratification. New targets have emerged , mostly in the heterogeneous B-other group , particularly in the Philadelphia-like ALL subgroup , which requires both in-depth molecular investigations and specific evaluations of targeted treatments. The remaining gap in the excellent results reported in children has many other contributing factors that should not be underestimated , including late or difficult access to care and/or trials , increased acute toxicities , and poor adherence to treatment. Specific programs should be designed to take into account those factors and finally ameliorate survival and quality of life for AYAs with ALL.
