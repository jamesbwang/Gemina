  Current therapeutic strategies entail identifying and characterizing a single protein receptor whose inhibition is likely to result in the successful treatment of a disease of interest , and testing experimentally large libraries of small molecule compounds `` in vitro '' and `` in vivo '' to identify promising inhibitors in model systems and determine if the findings are extensible to humans. This highly complex process is largely based on tests , errors , risk , time , and intensive costs. The virtual computational study of compounds simulates situations predicting possible drug linkages with multiple protein target atomic structures , taking into account the dynamic protein inhibitor , and can help identify inhibitors efficiently , particularly for complex drug-resistant diseases. Some discussions will relate to the potential benefits of this approach , using HIV-1 and Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> infections as examples. Some authors have proposed a virtual drug discovery that not only identifies efficient inhibitors but also helps to minimize side effects and toxicity , thus increasing the likelihood of successful therapies. This chapter discusses concepts and research of bioactive multitargets related to toxicology.
