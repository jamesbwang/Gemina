  Available data concerning the association between RAD51 135G/C ( rs1801320) polymorphism and the risk of 3 common gynecological cancers still could not reach a consensus. Thus , we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the relationship. Several electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant articles were screened to identify the studies up to July 2017. Then a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the connection between 3 common gynecological tumors ' susceptibility and RAD51 135G/C polymorphism in different inheritance models. Simultaneously , we did subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis if necessary. A total of 11 articles including 14 studies involving 4097 cases and 5890 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Overall , RAD51 135G/C polymorphism increased the risk of 3 common gynecological tumors. The subgroup analysis stratified by cancer types- endometrial carcinoma ( EC) and ovarian cancer ( OC)- showed that RAD51 135G/C polymorphism increased the risk of EC: allele model ( C vs G: odds ratio ( OR) = 4.32 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 2.63-7.10 , P < .00001) , dominant model ( CC + GC vs GG: OR = 2.28 , 95 % CI = 1.44-3.60 , P = .004) , recessive model ( CC vs GC + GG: OR = 10.27 , 95 % CI = 14.71-22.38 , P < .00001) , and homozygous model ( CC vs GG: OR = 7.26 , 95 % CI = 3.59-14.68 , P < .00001) , but there was no significant association between RAD51 135G/C polymorphism and OC. In the subgroup analysis stratified by source of controls , a significantly increased risk was observed in hospital-based studies. Nevertheless , the data showed RAD51 135G/C polymorphism had no link in population-based studies. This meta-analysis suggested that RAD51 135G/C polymorphism was a risk factor for the three common gynecological tumors , especially for EC among hospital-based populations.
