  Pruritus is a common symptom in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL) and critically affects the quality of life of patients. Understanding the pruritogenesis has led to development of new therapeutic agents with promising outcomes in management of this recalcitrant symptom. Clinical assessments are warranted to aid in evaluation of treatment response or disease recurrence. Severe pruritus scores may require further investigation of emotional distress for a better patient approach. Dermatologists play a key role in the treatment of CTCL-pruritus by guiding the patient in the importance of preserving the integrity of the skin barrier.
