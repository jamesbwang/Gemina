  Thymidine phosphorylase ( TP) is an angiogenic enzyme. It plays an important role in angiogenesis , tumour growth , invasion and metastasis. In current research work , we study the effect of structural modification of dihydropyrimidine-2-ones ( DHPM-2-ones) on TP inhibition. A series of eighteen new derivatives of 3,4-dihydropyrimidone-2-one were designed and synthesized through the structural modification at C-6 position. All these new derivatives were then assessed for in-vitro inhibition of thymidine phosphorylase ( TP) from E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. Oxadiazole derivatives 4a-e exhibited excellent TP-inhibition at low micromolar concentration levels better than standard drug 7-deazaxanthine ( 7-DX). Among all these compounds , 4b was found to be the most potent with IC
