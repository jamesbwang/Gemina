  Unique combination of ionic conductivity and anisotropic physical properties in ionic liquid crystals leads to new dynamic properties exploited in modern technological applications. Structural and dynamics information at atomic level for molecules and ions in mesophases can be obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) spectroscopy through the measurements of dipole-dipole spin couplings.
