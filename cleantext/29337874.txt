  The magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD) angular rate sensor ( ARS) with low noise level in ultra-wide bandwidth is developed in lasing and imaging applications , especially the line-of-sight ( LOS) system. A modified MHD ARS combined with the Coriolis effect was studied in this paper to expand the sensor & rsquo; s bandwidth at low frequency ( < 1 Hz) , which is essential for precision LOS pointing and wide-bandwidth LOS jitter suppression. The model and the simulation method were constructed and a comprehensive solving method based on the magnetic and electric interaction methods was proposed. The numerical results on the Coriolis effect and the frequency response of the modified MHD ARS were detailed. In addition , according to the experimental results of the designed sensor consistent with the simulation results , an error analysis of model errors was discussed. Our study provides an error analysis method of MHD ARS combined with the Coriolis effect and offers a framework for future studies to minimize the error.
