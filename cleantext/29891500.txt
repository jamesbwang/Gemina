  Before the development of the Brusselator , the Sel ` kov<pathogen> and Turing models were considered as possible prototype models of chemical oscillations. We first analyse their Hopf bifurcation branches and show that they become vertical past a critical value of the control parameter. We explain this phenomenon by the emergence of canard orbits. Second , we analyse all solutions in the phase plane and show that some initial conditions lead to unbounded trajectories even if there exists a locally stable attractor. Our findings mathematically explain why these too simple two-variable models fail to account for the emergence of chemical oscillations. They support the conclusion that the Brusselator is the first minimal two-variable model explaining the onset of stable oscillations in a way fully compatible with thermodynamics and the law of mass action.This article is part of the theme issue ` Dissipative structures in matter out of equilibrium: from chemistry , photonics and biology ( part 1) '.
