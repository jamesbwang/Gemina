  The human auditory change detection response known as mismatch negativity ( MMN) is an auditory event-related potential that has been extensively used to investigate various aspects of human brain function and dysfunction. However , two competing views of the neural mechanism that underlie MMN have been a subject of debate for decades. The sensory memory hypothesis claims that the MMN reflects sensory memory-based change detection. The adaptation hypothesis argues that neural adaptation and lateral inhibition can fully explain the MMN. To date , there remains a lack of empirical evidence exploring whether lateral inhibition underlies MMN , which is a critical assumption of the adaptation hypothesis. In this study , an oddball paradigm was developed in which tone-pairs composed of two sinusoidal tones<symptom> were presented as standards and deviants ( e.g. , a 330 Hz-392 Hz tone-pair was presented as standard , and a 392 Hz-330 Hz tone-pair was presented as deviant). The paradigm expected that two successive MMNs would be elicited by the two successive acoustic deviations in the deviant tone pairs , but when the two tones<symptom> composing the tone-pairs were close in frequency , the first MMN would be attenuated in amplitude due to lateral inhibition. The results demonstrate that only one ( the second) MMN was observed when the two tones<symptom> were close in frequency ( 330 Hz and 392 Hz) , but two MMNs were observed when the two tones<symptom> were distant in frequency ( 330 Hz and 3135 Hz). These results suggest that lateral inhibition is a neural mechanism that underlies the MMN response.
