  The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azilsartan ( Azil) as `` add-on '' treatment with methotrexate ( MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). This single center , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , pilot study included 64 patients with active RA. Patients received either placebo or Azil in addition to their currently used MTX doses for 90 days. The primary outcomes were DAS-28 , SDAI , HAQ-DI , CDAI , EGA , and swollen and tender joints count. The secondary outcomes were the changes in the pain visual analogue scale ( VAS-100) , serum levels of TNF- After 90 days , most clinical scores were significantly better in the Azil-treated group than in the placebo group. All inflammatory biomarkers were significantly improved after treatment with MTX + Azil compared to baseline and placebo group. No safety concerns were reported during the study period. Azilsartan improved the effects of methotrexate on the clinical scores and certain inflammatory biomarkers of patients with active RA. The protocol was registered under the number 507/SA/1024 at the local clinical studies database , College of Medicine , Sulaimani University.
