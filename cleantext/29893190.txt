  While transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells ( hiPSC-NSCs) shows therapeutic potential in animal stroke models , major concerns for translating hiPSC therapy to the clinic are efficacy and safety. Therefore , there is a demand to develop an optimal strategy to enhance the engraftment and regenerative capacity of transplanted hiPSC-NSCs to produce fully differentiated neural cells to replace lost brain tissues. Metformin , an FDA-approved drug , is an optimal neuroregenerative agent that not only promotes NSC proliferation but also drives NSCs toward differentiation. In this regard , we hypothesize that preconditioning of hiPSC-NSCs with metformin before transplantation into the stroke-damaged brain will improve engraftment and regenerative capabilities of hiPSC-NSCs , ultimately enhancing functional recovery. In this study , we show that pretreatment of hiPSC-NSCs with metformin enhances the proliferation and differentiation of hiPSC-NSCs in culture. Furthermore , metformin-preconditioned hiPSC-NSCs show increased engraftment 1 week post-transplantation in a rat endothelin-1 focal ischemic stroke model. In addition , metformin-preconditioned cell grafts exhibit increased survival compared to naive cell grafts at 7 weeks post-transplantation. Analysis of the grafts demonstrates that metformin preconditioning enhances the differentiation of hiPSC-NSCs at the expense of their proliferation. As an outcome , rats receiving metformin-preconditioned cells display accelerated gross motor recovery and reduced infarct volume. These studies represent a vital step forward in the optimization of hiPSC-NSC-based transplantation to promote post-stroke recovery.
