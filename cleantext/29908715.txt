  Patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of engaging in violence towards others , compared to both the general population and most other patient groups. We have here explored the role of cortico-limbic impairments in schizophrenia , and have considered these brain regions specifically within the framework of a popular neuroanatomical model of impulsive aggression. In line with this model , evidence in patients with aggressive schizophrenia implicated structural deficits associated with impaired decision-making , emotional control and evaluation , and social information processing , especially in the orbitofrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Given the pivotal role of the orbitofrontal and ventrolateral cortex in emotion control and evaluation , structural deficits may result in inappropriate use of socially relevant information and improper recognition of impulses that are in need for regulation. Furthermore , we have extended the original model and incorporated the striatum<pathogen> , important for the generation of aggressive impulses , as well as the hippocampus , a region critical for decision-making , into the model. Lastly , we discuss the question whether structural impairments are specific to aggressive schizophrenia. Our results suggest , that similar findings can be observed in other aggressive patient populations , making the observed impairments non-specific to aggressive schizophrenia. This points towards a shared condition , across pathologies , a potential common denominator being impulsive aggression.
