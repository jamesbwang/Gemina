  Frequent misdiagnosis of pediatric ankle traumas leads to inappropriate management , which may result in residual pain , instability , slower return to physical activity , and long-term degenerative changes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the consistency of diagnosis , management , and the treatment of acute lateral pediatric ankle trauma in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. The hypothesis was that the initial diagnosis is often incorrect , and the treatment varies considerably amongst orthopedic surgeons.We conducted a retrospective study of all cases of ankle sprains and Salter-Harris one ( SH1) fractures referred to our orthopedic surgery service between May and August 2014. Exclusion criteria included ankle fractures other than SH1 types , and cases where treatment was initially undertaken elsewhere before referral to our service. Primary outcome was the difference between initial and final diagnosis.Among 3047 cases reviewed , 31 matched our inclusion criteria. Initial diagnosis was 20 SH1 fractures , 8 acute ankle sprains , and 3 uncertain , with a change in diagnosis for 48.5 % at follow-up. Accurate diagnosis can be difficult in pediatric ankle trauma , with case management and specific treatments varying considerably. This study reinforces the need to evaluate the safety of a general treatment algorithm for all lateral ankle trauma with normal radiographs.Level of evidence III.
