  Iron ( Fe) is an essential micronutrient for both microbes and their hosts. The biologic importance of Fe derives from its inherent ability to act as a universal redox catalyst , co-opted in a variety of biochemical processes critical to maintain life. Animals evolved several mechanisms to retain and limit Fe availability to pathogenic microbes , a resistance mechanism termed `` nutritional immunity. '' Likewise , pathogenic microbes coevolved to deploy diverse and efficient mechanisms to acquire Fe from their hosts and in doing so overcome nutritional immunity. In this review , we discuss how the innate immune system regulates Fe metabolism to withhold Fe from pathogenic microbes and how strategies used by pathogens to acquire Fe circumvent these resistance mechanisms.
