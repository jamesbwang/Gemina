  In this study , we aimed to investigate possible interactions among the apolipoprotein E ( ApoE) and panic disorder ( PD) , taking into account serum cholesterol levels and subfractions. ApoE genotyping was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in DNA samples of PD patient group ( n = 45) and healthy control group ( n = 50). The serum lipid levels , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) , and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL) subfraction analysis were examined. There was a significant difference of ApoE genotypes in patient and control groups. The E3/E3 genotypes lower whereas E4 allele carriers were significantly higher in PD group ApoE4allele carriers had 3.2-fold higher risk of PD. PD group had significantly lower LDL and HDL levels. In spite of the decreased levels of total LDL , antiatherogenic large LDL subgroup was significantly lower in a patient with PD. Antiatherogenic large HDL and Intermediate HDL levels were lower , while atherogenic small HDL subfraction was significantly higher in PD group. Furthermore , Apo E3/E3 genotype carriers had significantly higher large LDL , HDL , large HDL , intermediate HDL level , and also had highest HDL between all the groups. ApoE4 allele carriers while they had highest atherogenic small HDL level. E4 allele can be associated with PD as an eligible risk factor , the E3/E3 could be a risk-reducing factor for PD. Patients with PD not only had lower LDL and HDL levels but also they have higher atherogenic LDL and HDL subfractions. Also , E3/E3 genotype carriers had convenient but ApoE4 carriers had atherogenic plasma cholesterol levels and subfractions.
