  Vein endothelial cells ( VECs) constitute an important barrier for macromolecules and circulating cells from the blood<symptom> to the tissues , stabilizing the colloid osmotic pressure of the blood , regulating the vascular tone , and rapidly changing the intercellular connection , and maintaining normal physiological function. Tight junction has been discovered as an important structural basis of intercellular connection and may play a key role in intercellular connection injuries or vascular diseases and selenium ( Se) deficiency symptoms. Hence , we replicated the Se-deficient broilers model and detected the specific microRNA in response to Se-deficient vein by using quantitative real time-PCR ( qRT-PCR) analysis. Also , we selected miR-128-1-5p based on differential expression in vein tissue and confirmed its target gene cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CADM1) by the dual luciferase reporter assay and qRT-PCR in VECs. We made the ectopic miR-128-1-5p expression for the purpose of validating its function on tight junction. The result showed that miR-128-1-5p and CADM1 were involved in the ZO-1-mediated tight junction , increased paracellular permeability , and arrested cell cycle. We presumed that miR-128-1-5p and Se deficiency might trigger tight junction. Interestingly , miR-128-1-5p inhibitor and fasudil in part hinder the destruction of the intercellular structure caused by Se deficiency. The miR-128-1-5p/ CADM1/tight junction axis provides a new avenue toward understanding the mechanism of Se deficiency , revealing a novel regulation model of tight junction injury in vascular diseases.
