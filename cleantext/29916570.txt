  While in the international literature , research on burnout predictors among correctional officers is well developed , as regards Italy there is a paucity of empirical evidence. Therefore , the aim of the present study was to identify , among various types of psychosocial factors , the burnout ( i.e. , emotional exhaustion<symptom> , depersonalization and personal accomplishment) predictors in a sample of Italian correctional officers. The study involved 130 correctional officers that filled out a self-reported questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions highlighted as predictors of emotional exhaustion<symptom>: relational demands , reward and physical demands; depersonalization: role conflict and support from colleagues; personal accomplishment: skill discretion. Generally speaking , the present study confirms that the three burnout subdimensions were predicted by different psychosocial factors. Moreover , results highlighted that both intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of the job , and social aspects significantly explained burnout among correctional officers. Conversely , no organizational factors were found to be burnout predictors. Interventions aimed at preventing burnout among correctional officers may include training programs aimed at developing interpersonal skills. Moreover , the paper argues that both the detention conditions and the quality of work life among correctional officers may benefit from the increasing of the psycho-educational staff within the Italian correctional facilities.
