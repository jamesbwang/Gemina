  Mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor ( CSF3R) gene occur frequently in chronic neutrophilic leukemia<disease> and are rare in de novo acute leukemia<disease>. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of CSF3R mutations in acute leukemia<disease> and their association with other genetic abnormalities. Amplicon-targeted , next-generation sequencing of 58 genes was performed retrospectively on 1152 patients ( acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) , n = 587; acute lymphoid leukemia<disease> ( ALL) , n = 565). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect 35 leukemia-specific gene fusions. CSF3R mutations ( 26 patients) were detected in 3.6 % ( 13 of 364 patients) , 4.6 % ( 8 of 175 patients) , and 8.3 % ( 4 of 48 patients) of those with de novo , relapsed , and secondary AML , respectively , and in 0.2 % ( 1 of 565 patients) of those with ALL. In total , 9 distinct CSF3R mutations were detected. Membrane-proximal missense mutations and cytoplasmic truncations were identified as mutually exclusive. The proportion of patients who had French-American-British subtypes M2 and M4 in the CSF3R-mutated group was significantly greater than that in the CSF3R wild-type group for both the de novo AML cohort ( P = .001) and the relapsed AML cohort ( P = .024). All de novo and relapsed AMLs with CSF3R mutations were associated with genetic alterations in transcription factors , including RUNX1-RUNX1T1 , CBFB-MYH11 , double-mutated CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α ( CEBPAdm) , and NPM1 mutations; and core-binding factor gene abnormalities and CEBPAdm accounted for 90.5 % ( 19 of 21 patients). CSF3R mutations are uncommon in AML; however , when they occur , they are often associated with core-binding factor gene abnormalities and CEBPAdm. An in-depth understanding of the interaction between these genetic alterations could facilitate a clearer understanding of the role of CSF3R mutations in AML development and may be used for disease classification , prognosis , and the development of targeted therapy.
