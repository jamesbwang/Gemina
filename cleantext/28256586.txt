  Pseudorabies virus ( PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus<pathogen> of swine. PRV has a large double-stranded DNA genome and , as the latest investigations have revealed , a very complex transcriptome. Here , we present a large RNA-Seq dataset , derived from both short- and long-read sequencing. The dataset contains 1.3 million 100 bp paired-end reads that were obtained from the Illumina random-primed libraries , as well as 10 million 50 bp single-end reads generated by the Illumina polyA-seq. The Pacific Biosciences RSII non-amplified method yielded 57,021 reads of inserts ( ROIs) aligned to the viral genome , the amplified method resulted in 158,396 PRV-specific ROIs , while we obtained 12,555 ROIs using the Sequel platform. The Oxford Nanopore 's MinION device generated 44,006 reads using their regular cDNA-sequencing method , whereas 29,832 and 120,394 reads were produced by using the direct RNA-sequencing and the Cap-selection protocols , respectively. The raw reads were aligned to the PRV reference genome ( KJ717942 .1). Our provided dataset can be used to compare different sequencing approaches , library preparation methods , as well as for validation and testing bioinformatic pipelines.
