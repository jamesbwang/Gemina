  Many pathogens can enter into a viable but nonculturable ( VBNC) state in response to harsh environmental stresses. Bacteria in this state can retain certain features of viable cells , such as cellular integrity , metabolic activity , or virulence and may present health risks associated with drinking water. In this study , we investigated the ability of chlorination and chloramination , which are widely used methods to disinfect drinking water , to induce Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> into a VBNC state. After treatment with chlorine and chloramine at concentrations of 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 mg/L , the counts of culturable E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> cells decreased from 10
