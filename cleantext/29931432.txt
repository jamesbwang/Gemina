  Optical molecular imaging , a highly sensitive and noninvasive technique which is simple to operate , inexpensive , and has the real-time capability , is increasingly being used in the diagnosis and treatment of carcinomas. The near-infrared fluorescence dye indocyanine green ( ICG) is widely used in optical imaging for the dynamic detection of sentinel lymph nodes ( SLNs) in real time improving the detection rate and accuracy. ICG has the advantages of low scattering in tissue absorbance , low auto-fluorescence , and high signal-to-background ratio. The detection rate of axillary sentinel lymph nodes biopsy ( SLNB) in breast cancers with ICG was more than 95 % , the false-negative rate was lower than 10 % , and the average detected number ranged from 1.75 to 3.8. The combined use of ICG with nuclein or blue dye resulted in a lower false-negative rate. ICG is also being used for the sentinel node detection in other malignant cancers such as head and neck , gastrointestinal , and gynecological carcinomas. In this article , we provide an overview of numerous studies that used the near-infrared fluorescence imaging to detect the sentinel lymph nodes in breast carcinoma and other malignant cancers. It is expected that with improvements in the optical imaging systems together with the use of a combination of multiple dyes and verification in large clinical trials , optical molecular imaging will become an essential tool for SLN detection and image-guided precise resection.
