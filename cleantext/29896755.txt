  Coffee flavor can be significantly influenced by microbial activities in spontaneous fermentation of coffee cherries. The potential of lactic acid bacteria ( LAB) for flavor modulation through controlled fermentation of green coffee beans has not been explored. Fermentation by Lactobacillus<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> HN001 with and without 1 % w/w glucose supplementation led to modification of flavor-related constituents in green coffee beans , which translated into modulation of coffee volatiles upon roasting. The LAB consumed almost all glucose and fructose , leaving sucrose behind. Amino acids , malic , citric and succinic acids were partially catabolized. Glucose supplementation enhanced lactic acid production , but repressed acetic acid formation. After roasting at 235 Lactic acid fermentation of green coffee beans is a new strategy for coffee flavor modulation , creating novel aroma characteristics. This article is protected by copyright.
