  In the framework of the quantum-classical Liouville equation ( QCLE) , the quantum kinetic expansion ( QKE) of the spin-boson model is extended to an arbitrary combination of the bath potential and the system-bath interaction. The mixed quantum-classical estimation of the QKE rate kernels and modification functions are transformed into averages of deterministic classical trajectories over the Wigner initial distribution. For the standard spin-boson model , the QCLE-QKE method produces exactly the same result as that from full quantum dynamics and the numerical applicability of the approximate action-angle initial distribution is verified. For an anharmonic bath with the quartic potential , the QCLE-QKE calculation under the action-angle initial distribution illustrates the influence of this specific anharmonicity. With the increase of the quartic parameter , the fourth order QKE corrections are suppressed and the short-time population transfer is accelerated together with an enhanced quantum oscillation.
