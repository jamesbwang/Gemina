  Appendiceal mucinous tumour ( AMT) is a very uncommon disease. We aimed to evaluate preoperative and postoperative characteristics as well as long-term outcomes of patients with appendiceal mucinous adenomas and peritoneal pseudomyxoma ( PMP). A consecutive cohort of patients diagnosed with AMT were included in the study. Tumour recurrence and the development of PMP was diagnosed based on the patients ' complaints , physical examination , imaging studies , and biopsy results. The calculation of survival rates was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Between January 2003 and February 2013 , 25 patients had AMT. 15 patients underwent appendectomy only ( 60 %) , 5 patients ( 20 %) right hemicolectomy , 4 patients ( 16 %) cytoreductive surgery ( CRS) ± hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC) , and 1 patient ( 4 %) appendectomy with caecal resection. Another 2 patients underwent CRS and HIPEC 4 days and 3 years , respectively , following initial appendectomy. In the histopathologic examination , adenoma was diagnosed in 12 patients ( 48 %); among these , low-grade PMP was found in 1 patient ( 4 %). Low-grade appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma ( AMCa) was diagnosed in 11 patients ( 44 %); among these , low-grade PMP was found in seven cases ( 28 %) and high-grade AMCa was diagnosed in 2 patients ( 8 %). 2 of 8 PMP patients did not undergo CRS ± HIPEC because of comorbidities. The 5-year overall survival was 100 % for the adenomas and 62 % for PMP patients. AMT is a very rare entity with a considerably good outcome even in disseminated disease. CRS and HIPEC is a gold standard treatment for PMP with excellent prognosis. However , our results could still be improved in the future.
