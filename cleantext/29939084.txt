  Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) values on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI) have been reported to correlate with high-Gleason score ( GS) prostate cancer. However , the relative ADC values between tumor lesions<symptom> and normal tissue have been suggested as more suitable than the absolute ADC values for evaluation of diffusion abnormalities , because absolute ADC values are susceptible to differences in scanners or scanner settings. The present study evaluated the usefulness of the relative assessment of ADC values between tumor lesions<symptom> and normal tissue on preoperative mpMRI for the prediction of high-risk prostate cancer on radical prostatectomy specimens. A retrospective analysis of 48 men who underwent radical prostatectomy between January 2013 and December 2014 was conducted. MpMRI was performed with a 3.0-T scanner using b-values of 0 and 1500 s/mm The inter-rater reliability between two radiologists for ADC The relative assessment of ADC values between tumor lesions<symptom> and normal tissue could improve the detection rate of high-risk prostate cancers.
