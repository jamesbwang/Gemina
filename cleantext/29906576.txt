  The papillary tumor of the pineal region ( PTPR) is a rare grade II-III pineal lesion<symptom> with peculiar histologic and immunohistochemical features. These tumors mostly occur in adults , rarely in children ( 19 cases reported up to now). We present a 3-year-old boy who was re-operated for a recurrent PTPR ( grade II). The gross total resection of the lesion<symptom> , through an occipital interhemispheric approach in sitting position , was followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Histological examination revealed tumor progression ( grade III) , and the MIB-1 proliferation index was higher than 25 %. The patient continues to do well with no evidence of recurrence more than 3 years following surgery. A comprehensive literature review regarding the PTPR , including the current management in children , is reported. PTPR are extremely rare in children , and immunohistochemistry is needed for their differentiation from other pineal tumors. These tumors present a big rate of recurrence , and a multidisciplinary management ( microsurgical resection followed by radio- and/or chemo-therapy) is needed in most of the cases to achieve favorable outcomes.
