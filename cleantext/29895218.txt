  Purpose Despite antiretroviral therapy , approximately half of individuals with human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) will develop HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ( HAND). Efficiency of brain networks is of great importance for cognitive functioning , since functional networks may reorganize or compensate to preserve normal cognition. This study aims to compare efficiency of the posterior cingulate cortex ( PCC) between patients with and without HAND and controls. We hypothesize HAND negative ( HAND-) patients will show higher PCC efficiency than HAND positive ( HAND +) patients. Methods A total of 10 HAND + patients were compared with 9 HAND- patients and 17 gender- , age- , and education-matched controls. Resting-state functional MRI was acquired with a 3 Tesla scanner. Local efficiency , a measure of network functioning , was investigated for PCC. Network differences among HAND + , HAND- patients and controls were tested as well as correlations between network parameters and cognitive test performance in different domains. Results HAND- patients showed significantly increased PCC efficiency compared with healthy controls ( p = 0.015). No differences were observed between HAND + patients and either controls ( p = 0.327) or HAND- patients ( p = 0.152). In HAND- patients , PCC efficiency was positively related with cognitive performance in the attention/working memory domain ( p = 0.003). Conversely , in HAND + patients , PCC efficiency was negatively correlated with performance in the abstraction/executive domain ( p = 0.002). Conclusion HAND- patients showed a higher level of PCC efficiency compared with healthy subjects , and PCC efficiency was positively related to cognitive performance. These results support the functional reorganization hypothesis , that increased PCC efficiency is a compensation technique to maintain cognitive functioning.
