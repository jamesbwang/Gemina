  Multicenter clinical trials level 1 evidence favors the application of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients , especially the in the elderly cohort. Carotid artery stenting has been proposed as a possible early alternative in selected patients after onset of ipsilateral neurologic symptoms. It is well known that treatment of acute stroke is time-dependent in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by high-grade stenosis of the internal carotid artery , but intensive medical treatment in conjunction with intervention to improve stroke severity and clinical outcomes has not been established. Two major clinical concerns exist: ( 1) the risk of hemorrhagic infarction after cerebral revascularization in the acute stage and ( 2) application of carotid stenting in the acute embolic stage , which may be associated with continued embolic risk after carotid artery stenting compared to carotid endarterectomy , which removes the symptomatic plaque. This review summarizes the indications and results of early carotid artery stenting after onset of neurologic symptoms , considering the new carotid stents and cerebral protection systems available for clinical use and enhanced stenting techniques.
