  Relebactam is a novel class A and C Î²-lactamase inhibitor that is being developed in combination with imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of serious gram-negative bacterial infections. Here we report on 2 phase 1 randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , pharmacokinetics , safety , and tolerability studies of relebactam administered with or without imipenem/cilastatin in healthy participants: 1) a single dose ( 25 to 1150 mg) and multiple dose ( 50 to 625 mg every 6 hours ( q6h) for 7 to 14 days) escalation study in men and 2) a single dose ( 125 mg) study in women and elderly. Following single or multiple dose intravenous administration over 30 minutes , relebactam plasma concentrations declined biexponentially with a terminal half-life ( t
