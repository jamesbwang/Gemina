  Oral submucous fibrosis<disease> ( OSF) is a progressive scarring disease. MicroRNA-200b ( miR-200b) has been reported as a tumour suppressor , but its role in the precancerous OSF remains unknown. In this study , we investigated the impact of miR-200b on myofibroblastic differentiation activity. Arecoline is a major areca nut alkaloid and has been employed to induce the elevated myofibroblast activity in human buccal mucosal fibroblasts ( BMFs). Treatment of arecoline in BMFs dose-dependently reduced gene expression of miR-200b , which corresponded with the decreased expression of miR-200b in fBMFs. The arecoline-induced myofibroblast activities were abolished by overexpression of miR-200b in BMFs , and the same results were observed in fBMFs. In addition , α-SMA was inhibited by an increase in miR-200b. We further demonstrated that miR-200b-mediated decrease in ZEB2 led to down-regulation of α-SMA , vimentin. Loss of miR-200b resulted in enhanced collagen contraction and migration capabilities , and knockdown of ZEB2 reversed these phenomena. Lastly , we showed the expression of miR-200b was significantly less and ZEB2 was markedly higher in OSF tissues. These results suggested that down-regulation of miR-200b may contribute to the pathogenesis of areca quid-associated OSF through the regulation of ZEB2 and myofibroblast hallmarks.
