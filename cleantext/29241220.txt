  Oral cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer worldwide. Carcinogenesis is a complex process , in which heterogeneity plays an important role in the development and progression of the disease. This review provides an overview of the current biological and clinical significance of circulating tumour cells ( CTCs) , circulating tumour DNA ( ctDNA) , and exosomes for diagnosis and prognosis of oral cancer. We highlight the importance of liquid biopsy-- using blood and saliva-- which represents a potential alternative to solid biopsy for diagnosis and prognosis. Moreover , liquid biomarkers allow for the real-time monitoring of tumour evolution and therapeutic responses , initiating the era of personalized medicine. However , in oral cancer , the impact of liquid biopsies in clinical settings is still limited , requiring further studies to discover the best scenario for its clinical use.
