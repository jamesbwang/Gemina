  The therapeutic efficacy and safety of stored red blood cells ( RBCs) relies on minimal in-bag hemolysis<symptom>. The accuracy of current methods of measuring hemolysis<symptom> can suffer as a result of specimen collection and processing artefacts. To test whether Raman spectroscopy could be used to assess hemolysis<symptom>. RBCs were stored for as long as 42 days. Raman spectra of RBCs were measured before and after washing , and hemolysis<symptom> was measured in supernatant by visible spectroscopy. Raman spectra indicated increased concentrations of oxyhemoglobin ( oxyHb) and methemoglobin ( metHb) , and decreased membrane fluidity with storage age. Changes in oxyHb and metHb were associated with the intraerythrocytic and extracellular fractions , respectively. Hemolysis<symptom> increased in a storage age-dependent manner. Changes in Raman bands reflective of oxyHb , metHb , and RBC membranes<symptom> correlated with hemolysis<symptom>; the most statistically significant change was an increased intensity of metHb and decreased membrane fluidity. These data suggest that Raman spectroscopy may offer a new label-free modality to assess RBC hemolysis<symptom> during cold storage.
