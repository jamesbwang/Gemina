  In recent years posttranslational modification ( PTM) of proteins has emerged as a key process that integrates plant growth and response to a changing environment. During the processes of domestication and breeding , plants were selected for various yield and adaptational characteristics. The posttranslational modifier Small Ubiquitin like Modifier ( SUMO) protein is known to have a role in the regulation of a number of these characteristics. Using bioinformatics , we mined the genomes of cereal and Brassica crops and their non-crop relatives Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon for ULP SUMO proteases sequences. We discovered the SUMO system in cereal crops is disproportionately elaborate in comparison to B. distachyon. We use this data to propose deSUMOylation as a mechanism for specificity in the SUMO system.
