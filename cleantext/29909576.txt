  The pivotal trials for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( NVAF) compared rivaroxaban , dabigatran , and apixaban with warfarin , as did most claims-based studies. Comparisons with phenprocoumon , the most frequently used vitamin K antagonist ( VKA) in Germany , are scarce. Risk of bleeding , ischemic stroke , and all-cause mortality in patients with NVAF were analyzed using data for 2010 to 2014 from a large German claims database. New users of oral anticoagulants from January 2012 to December 2013 were included and observed over 1 year. Baseline characteristics were adjusted using propensity score matching and logistic regression. Several sensitivity analyses were carried out. Fifty-nine thousand four hundred forty-nine rivaroxaban , 23,654 dabigatran , 4894 apixaban , and 87,997 matched phenprocoumon users were included. Adjusted hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence intervals) compared with phenprocoumon were as follows: hospitalized bleedings<symptom>: rivaroxaban 1.04 ( 0.97; 1.11) , dabigatran 0.87 ( 0.77; 0.98) , and apixaban 0.65 ( 0.50; 0.86); ischemic stroke: rivaroxaban 1.05 ( 0.94; 1.17) , dabigatran 1.14 ( 0.96; 1.35) , and apixaban 1.84 ( 1.20; 2.84); all-cause mortality: rivaroxaban 1.17 ( 1.11; 1.22) , dabigatran 1.04 ( 0.95; 1.13) , and apixaban 1.14 ( 0.97; 1.34). With rivaroxaban , no significant differences were observed compared to phenprocoumon with regard to hospitalized bleedings<symptom> or ischemic strokes. Dabigatran was associated with fewer bleedings<symptom> and a similar risk of ischemic strokes compared to phenprocoumon. Apixaban was also associated with fewer bleedings<symptom> but was unexpectedly associated with more ischemic strokes , possibly reflecting selective prescribing. The association of rivaroxaban with higher all-cause mortality unrelated to bleedings<symptom> or strokes has been described previously but remains to be explained.
