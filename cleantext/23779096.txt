  Numerous clinical studies have reported the association between high circulating levels of lipocalin-2 ( LCN2) and metabolic diseases. However , only few studies have addressed sexually dimorphic , either in its circulating concentration or in its expression in other organs. To the best of our knowledge , LCN2 and the 24p3 receptor ( 24p3R) , have not been identified in gonads; therefore , the present study analyzed their mRNA expression profile and cellular localization in gonads collected from fetal rats at 21 days post coitum , as well as from neonatal rats at 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 20 and 30 postnatal days. Semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical assays revealed that the LCN2 mRNA during perinatal and pre-pubertal stages presented a sex-specific expression pattern , being higher in ovaries than in testes collected at these stages. Furthermore , the mRNA levels of the long and short isoforms of the 24p3R ( 507 and 350 bp , respectively) , were lower in female gonads from postnatal day 0 onwards in comparison with the levels observed in males , but before birth , the short isoform of the 24p3R was higher in ovaries than in testes. In addition , in females , the abundance of mRNA of this isoform was drastically diminished at 24 h after birth. Furthermore , this specific expression profile of LCN2 and 24p3R at perinatal and prepubertal stages coincides with events of cellular proliferation and apoptosis within both gonads. Immunohistochemical assays revealed that in ovaries , LCN2 and 24p3R are present in germinal and somatic cells of follicles , while in testes , this adipokine and its receptor are only located in germinal cells. These findings suggest that in murine gonads , LCN2/24p3R signaling may be involved either in cell proliferation or cell death driven by gonadotropin-independent or- dependent mechanisms.
