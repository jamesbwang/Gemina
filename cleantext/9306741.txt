  ( Purpose) The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of seat pressure distribution measurements based on a specific posture<symptom> to predict the pressure felt level when seated. ( Subjects and Methods) To examine the relationship between body pressure data and the driver 's perception , eleven subjects were selected to participate in a simulated driving experiment using a pressure mat as a direct measurement method to measure the seat pan 's pressure distribution. The buttock-popliteal length was measured using an anthropometer , and the pressure felt ratings evaluated after the body pressure measurements were recorded. Accordingly , this was then followed by performing statistical analysis using seat pressure measurements , and the buttock-popliteal length as independent variables along with subjective ratings selected of the pressure felt by the drivers ' as dependent variables. ( Results) The findings of this study suggest that the direct measurements and anthropometric body data are positively correlated with the predictive model thereby confirming the validity of the model with an R
