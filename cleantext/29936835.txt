  Formation of positively charged gold nanoparticle layers on polystyrene microparticles ( PSMs600) was studied using the electrokinetic and the concentration depletion methods based on atomic force microscopy ( AFM) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) imaging. Primarily , the dependence of electrophoretic mobility of microparticles on the gold nanoparticle concentration in the suspension was measured. These results were quantitatively interpreted in terms of the three-dimensional electrokinetic model. This allowed to derive a formula for calculating the coverage of nanoparticles under in situ conditions whose validity was confirmed by direct SEM imaging of deposited gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs). Additionally , the maximum coverage of gold nanoparticles for various ionic strengths was determined using a concentration depletion method based on AFM imaging of residual particles deposited on the silica substrate. The maximum coverage increased with ionic strength attaining a value of 0.35 for the ionic strength of 3 Ã— 10
