  The availability of direct-acting antiviral ( DAA) therapy might have impacted use of HCV-infected ( HCV +) deceased-donor kidneys for transplantation. We used 2005-2018 SRTR data to identify 18 936 candidates willing to accept HCV + kidneys and 3348 HCV + recipients of HCV + kidneys. We compared willingness to accept , utilization , discard , and posttransplant outcomes associated with HCV + kidneys between 2 treatment eras ( Interferon ( IFN) era: 1/1/2005 - 12/5/2013 versus DAA era: 12/6/2013- 8/2/2018). Models were adjusted for candidate , recipient , and donor factors where appropriate. In the DAA era , candidates were 2.2-times more likely to list as willing to accept HCV + kidneys ( aOR: 2.072.232.41 , P < 0.001) , and HCV + recipients were 1.95-times more likely to have received an HCV + kidney ( aOR: 1.761.952.16 , P < 0.001). Median KDPI of HCV + kidneys decreased from 77 ( IQR 59-90) in 2005 to 53 ( 40-67) in 2017. KDPI of HCV- kidneys remained unchanged from 45 ( 21-74) to 47 ( 24-73). After adjustment , HCV + kidneys were 3.7-times more likely to be discarded than HCV- kidneys in the DAA era ( aRR 3.363.674.02 , P < 0.001); an increase from the IFN era ( aRR: 2.783.023.27 , P < 0.001). HCV + kidney use was concentrated within a subset of centers; 22.5 % of centers performed 75 % of all HCV + kidney transplants in the DAA era. Mortality risk associated with HCV + kidneys remained unchanged ( aHR: 1.071.191.32 in both eras). Given the elevated risk of death on dialysis facing HCV + candidates , improving quality of HCV + kidneys , and DAA availability , broader utilization of HCV + kidneys is warranted to improve access in this era of organ shortage.
