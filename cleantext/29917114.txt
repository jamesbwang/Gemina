  Adenoviruses are significant pathogens for the immunocompromised , arising from primary infection or reinfection. Serotyping is insufficient to support nosocomial transmission investigations. We investigate whether whole-genome sequencing ( WGS) provides clinically relevant information on transmission among patients in a paediatric tertiary hospital. We developed a target-enriched adenovirus<pathogen> WGS technique for clinical samples and retrospectively sequenced 107 adenovirus-positive residual diagnostic samples , including viraemias ( > 5x104 copies/ml) , from 37 patients collected January 2011- March 2016. WGS was used to determine genotype and for phylogenetic analysis. Adenovirus<pathogen> sequences were recovered from 105/107 samples. Full genome sequences were recovered from all 20 non-species C samples and from 36/85 species C viruses , with partial genome sequences recovered from the rest. Whole genome phylogenetic analysis suggested linkage of three genotype A31 cases and uncovered an unsuspected epidemiological link to an A31 infection first detected on the same ward four years earlier. In nine samples from one patient who died we identified a mixed genotype adenovirus<pathogen> infection. Adenovirus<pathogen> WGS from clinical samples is possible and useful for genotyping and molecular epidemiology. WGS identified likely nosocomial transmission with greater resolution than conventional genotyping , and distinguished between adenovirus<pathogen> disease due to single or multiple genotypes.
