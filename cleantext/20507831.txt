  With the increasing rise of professionalism in sport , teams and coaches are looking to technology to monitor performance in both games and training to find a competitive advantage. Wheelchair court sports ( wheelchair rugby , wheelchair tennis , and wheelchair basketball) are no exception , and the use of microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS)- based inertial measurement unit ( IMU) within this domain is one innovation researchers have employed to monitor aspects of performance. A systematic literature review was conducted which , after the exclusion criteria was applied , comprised of 16 records. These records highlighted the efficacy of IMUs in terms of device validity and accuracy. IMUs are ubiquitous , low-cost , and non-invasive. The implementation in terms of algorithms and hardware choices was evidenced as a barrier to widespread adoption. This paper , through the information collected from the systematic review , proposes a set of implementation guidelines for using IMUs for wheelchair data capture. These guidelines , through the use of flow-charts and data tables , will aid researchers in reducing the barriers to IMU implementation for propulsion assessment.
