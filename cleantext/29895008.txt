  The inflammatory response to a post-operative infection can increase the risk of tumour recurrence in cancer through the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. The aim of this study was review the literature to assess the relationship between post-operative complications and cancer recurrence. We performed a literature review of the mechanism of such an association and looked at evidence in different cancer subtypes. A relationship has been identified for many cancer subtypes , and multiple theories have been proposed for the mechanism of this association. Methods to reduce post-operative complications may impact positively on cancer recurrence rates. This review demonstrates that wound<disease> complications after surgery can have significant implications for cancer patients. Strategies are required to minimize the risk of post-operative wound<disease> complications in patients undergoing cancer resection.
