  To verify the influence of oophorectomy on lipidogram and glycemia. Fifty six female rats were divided into the following 7 groups ( n = 8): group 1- sham group , group 2- oophorectomy 30 days , group 3- oophorectomy 35 days , group 4- oophorectomy 40 days , group 5- oophorectomy 45 days , group 6- oophorectomy 70 days , group 7- oophorectomy 55 days. Animals were following by number of days according the group. Was evaluated the serum levels of glucose and lipid profile. The oophorectomized rats presented higher glycemia. Groups 3 , 4 , 6 and 7 had a higher glycemia and LDL levels ( except for group 6) and groups 6 and 7 had lowest levels of HDL. Group 7 had highest level of VLDL than oophorectomy groups. There was no difference in triglycerides levels. Oophorectomy was related to dyslipidemia and insulin resistance , mainly after 50th days.
