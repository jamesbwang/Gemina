  Thiosulfate and sulfate are metabolites of hydrogen sulfide ( H Subjects ( n = 6839) of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease ( PREVEND) study were followed prospectively. At baseline , 24-h urinary excretion of thiosulfate and sulfate was determined. Median urinary thiosulfate and sulfate excretion values were 1.27 ( interquartile range ( IQR) 0.89-2.37) Î¼mol/24 h and 15.7 ( IQR 12.0-20.3) mmol/24 h , respectively. Neither thiosulfate nor sulfate excretion showed an independent association with risk of CV events. Sulfate , but not thiosulfate , was inversely associated with risk of all-cause mortality , independent of potential confounders ( hazard ratio 0.73 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.63-0.84) , p < 0.001). This association appeared most pronounced for normolipidemic subjects ( p The strong association between sulfate excretion and mortality in the general population emphasizes the ( patho) physiological importance of sulfate or its precursor H We hypothesize that urinary sulfate excretion , which is inversely associated with all-cause mortality in the general population , holds clinical relevance as a beneficial modulator in health and disease.
