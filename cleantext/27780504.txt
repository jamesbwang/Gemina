  The clinical efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty ( PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty ( PKP) in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures after bilateral resection of ovarian cancer was investigated. Eighty-six patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures after bilateral resection of ovarian cancer admitted to the Second People 's Hospital of Hefei from September , 2015 to August , 2016 were selected and randomly divided into control group ( n = 43) and observation group ( n = 43). The control group was treated with PVP , while the observation group received PKP. The operation time , fluoroscopy times , bone cement volume and leakage rate of patients in the two groups were recorded; the postoperative pain of patients was compared using Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire; the changes in height of injured vertebra and Cobb angle of patients in two groups were compared; the efficacy of patients in the two groups was compared in accordance with Oswestry dysfunction index ( ODI) and Japanese Orthopedic Association ( JOA) low back pain scoring; and the quality of life was compared. The fluoroscopy times and bone cement leakage were significantly less in observation group than those in control group ( P < 0.05). After operation , the scores of ODI , MPQ and JOA in the two groups were significantly improved ( P < 0.05). The postoperative height of injured vertebra and the Cobb angle of patients in two groups were significantly different than those before the operation ( P < 0.05). The quality of life of patients in the observation group was higher than that in the control group one year after operation ( P < 0.05). In conclusion , PKP and PVP are effective in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures after bilateral resection of ovarian cancer; however , PKP is more conducive to lumbar stability and maintenance of intervertebral height thus greatly correcting the kyphosis , which is beneficial to improving the quality of life of patients.
