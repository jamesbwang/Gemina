  Objectives Retirement timing has been linked to a host of outcomes for individuals , families , and societies. The present study predicted retirement timing using profiles of preretirement family caregiving and gender. Method Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study , cluster analysis was used to create profiles of preretirement family caregiving ( operationalized as time and financial transfers to aging parents and adult children). These profiles , as well as gender , were used to predict later retirement timing. Results Four distinct preretirement caregiving profiles were evident. All profiles retired , on average , earlier than their full eligibility for Social Security benefits. A main effect of caregiving profile , but not gender , was evident. The Eldercare profile , which was characterized by high levels of time and financial transfers to aging parents , retired the earliest. There was not a significant interaction between caregiving profile and gender. Discussion When men enacted female-typical caregiving roles , their retirement timing resembled women 's. Eldercare , in particular , was associated with earlier retirement timing. Implications for individual retirement decision-making and policy are discussed.
