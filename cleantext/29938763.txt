  The evolution of multicellular organisms is generally thought ( and seems likely) to have been accompanied by the evolution of a stem cell system. Sponges , some of the early-evolved metazoans , have totipotent/pluripotent stem cells. Thus , uncovering the cellular and molecular bases of the sponge stem cells will not only be crucial for understanding the ancestral gene repertoire of animal stem cells , but will also give us clues to understanding the evolution of molecular mechanisms for maintaining multipotency ( pluripotency) and differentiation ability during animal evolution. Sponges ( Porifera) are a large phylum that includes an enormous number of species , whose cellular compositions and life cycles show striking variations. In the last decade , methodologies for molecular studies and sequencing resources have dramatically advanced and made it possible to clearly define stem cells in sponges in cellular and molecular terms. In this review , together with recent studies of sponges in various classes , the following issues will be discussed: i) recent findings that revealed that the previously proposed model that `` archeocytes and choanocytes are the two types of stem cells '' originally based on work in demosponges can be applied as a unified view of the stem cell system in sponges that have various cellular organizations , ii) the fact that sponge cells are more plastic than previously thought , as shown by recent studies of sponge regeneration both from dissociated cells and upon injury , and iii) the importance of transdifferentiation in sponge stem cell systems and regeneration.
