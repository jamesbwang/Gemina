  Secondary small bowel volvulus is a rare condition caused by adhesions after laparotomy or tumors. There are no clear guidelines for indication of laparoscopic surgery. A 69-year-old male visited our hospital complaining of epigastric pain. He had a history of hypopharyngeal carcinoma treated via pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy with restoration of esophageal continuity by harvesting a free jejunal autograft 6 years ago. Enhanced computed tomography revealed the whirl sign. An emergency laparoscopic operation was performed following a diagnosis of small bowel volvulus. This revealed rotation of the whole small bowel , involving the superior mesenteric artery as the center , and originating at the adhesion of the proximal and distal small bowel. Laparoscopic manipulation of volvulus and lysis of the adhesion were performed. The patient 's postoperative course was uneventful , and he was discharged on hospital day 5. Laparoscopic surgery may be useful for treating small bowel volvulus; however , the patient 's treatment indications should be judged carefully.
