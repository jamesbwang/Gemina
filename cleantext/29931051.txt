  The actin-binding protein Drebrin is up-regulated in response to arterial injury and reduces smooth muscle cell ( SMC) migration and proliferation through its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. We therefore tested the hypothesis that SMC Drebrin inhibits angiotensin II-induced remodeling of the proximal aorta. Angiotensin II was administered via osmotic minipumps at 1000 ng/kg/min continuously for 28 days in SM22-Cre +/ Dbnflox/flox ( SMC-Dbn-/-) and control mice. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> responses to angiotensin II were assessed by telemetry. After angiotensin II infusion , we assessed remodeling in the proximal ascending aorta by echocardiography and planimetry of histologic cross sections. Although the degree of hypertension was equivalent in SMC-Dbn-/- and control mice , SMC-Dbn-/- mice nonetheless exhibited 60 % more proximal aortic medial thickening and 2-fold more outward aortic remodeling than control mice in response to angiotensin II. Proximal aortas demonstrated greater cellular proliferation and matrix deposition in SMC-Dbn-/- mice than in control mice , as evidenced by a higher prevalence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive nuclei and higher levels of collagen I. Compared with control mouse aortas , SMC-Dbn-/- aortas demonstrated greater angiotensin II-induced NADPH oxidase activation and inflammation<symptom> , evidenced by higher levels of Ser-536-phosphorylated NFÎºB p65 subunits and higher levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 , matrix metalloproteinase-9 and adventitial macrophages. We conclude that SMC Drebrin deficiency augments angiotensin II-induced inflammation<symptom> and adverse aortic remodeling.
