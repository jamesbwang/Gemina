  The diffusion rates for water molecules in salt solutions depend on the identity of the ions , as well as their concentration. Among the alkali metal ions , cesium and potassium increase and sodium strongly decreases the diffusion constant of water. The origin of the difference can be understood by examining the simulation results using different potential models. In this work , aqueous solutions of salts are simulated with a variety of models. Commonly used non-polarizable models , which otherwise reproduce many experimental properties , do not capture the trend in the diffusion constant , while models which include polarization and/or charge transfer interactions do. For the non-polarizable models , the diffusion constant decreases too strongly with salt concentration. The changes in the water diffusion constant with increasing salt concentration match the diffusion constant of the ion. The ion diffusion constant is dependent on the residence time for water in the ion solvation shell. The non-polarizable models over-estimate the residence time , relative to the translational diffusion constant and so tend to under-estimate the ion and water diffusion constants.
