  The limited field of view of the X-ray image intensifier makes it difficult to cover a large target area with a single X-ray image. X-ray image stitching techniques have been proposed to produce a panoramic X-ray image. This paper presents an efficient intensity-based X-ray image stitcher , which does not rely on accurate C-arm motion control or auxiliary devices and hence is ready to use in clinic. The stitcher consumes sequentially captured X-ray images with overlap areas and automatically produces a panoramic image. The gradient information for optimization of image alignment is obtained using a back-propagation scheme so that it is convenient to adopt various image warping models. The proposed stitcher has the following advantages over existing methods: ( 1) no additional hardware modification or auxiliary markers are needed; ( 2) it is robust against feature-based approaches; ( 3) arbitrary warping models and shapes of the region of interest are supported; ( 4) seamless stitching is achieved using multi-band blending. Experiments have been performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed X-ray image stitcher is efficient , accurate and ready to use in clinic.
