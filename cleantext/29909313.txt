  The possible adverse effects of nanoplastics have received the great attention recently; however , their effects at environmentally relevant concentration on organisms are still largely unclear. We here employed Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> to investigate the combinational effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles ( TiO
