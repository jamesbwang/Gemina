  The mechanics of triply periodic minimal surfaces ( TPMSs) with three-dimensional ( 3D) graphene foams are systematically studied to understand the effects of structure and size on the mechanical properties , for example , elasticity , strength , and fracture. The design of lightweight open-shell porous solid materials with TPMSs has shown excellent and tunable load-bearing properties. However , fracture properties and their relations with surface topologies are largely unknown. Utilizing reactive molecular dynamics simulations , here we investigate the elastic and fracture properties of three different surface topologies with 3D graphene foams: P ( primitive) , D ( diamond) , and G ( gyroid) , called Schwarzites. Models with different lattice sizes are utilized to derive power laws , which can connect the properties along different sizes to shed light on the multiscale mechanics of TPMSs. Our study provides a systematic understanding of the relation between TPMS topologies and their mechanical properties , including failure mechanisms of graphene foams , opening opportunities to explore designable structures with tailored properties.
