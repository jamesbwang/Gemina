  To establish the correlates of depressive symptoms among Mexican community-dwelling older people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLWHIV). Cross-sectional , 2-center study of 328 participants aged 50 or older being followed in the outpatient HIV<pathogen> clinics of 2 tertiary care hospitals in Mexico. Data were obtained through a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the correlates of depressive symptoms. Mean age of participants was 58.4 years ( SD = 7.2) , and 82.9 % were men. Depressive symptoms were present in 15.9 % of participants. The multivariate logistic regression models showed that frailty and disability for activities of daily living were both independently associated with depressive symptoms. Frailty and disability were independent correlates of depressive symptoms in older PLWHIV. Future studies should attempt to explore the role of physical frailty and disability on psychosocial morbidity among older PLWHIV.
