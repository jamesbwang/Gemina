  This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI) on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation. Data of 195 patients were retrospectively analysed. Post-reperfusion aspartate ( AST) , alanine transaminase , and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) levels were the primary measures of IRI. Tumour recurrence was the primary endpoint. Post-reperfusion AST was a continuous risk factor for tumour recurrence in patients within Milan criteria ( p = 0.035) , with an optimal cut-off of 1896 U/L. Recurrence-free survival of patients within Milan criteria and post-reperfusion AST of < 1896 and â‰¥ 1896 U/L was 96.6 % and 71.9 % at 5 and 3.7 years , respectively ( p = 0.006). Additionally , post-reperfusion AST and LDH exceeding the upper quartile significantly increased the risk of HCC recurrence in patients within Milan criteria ( p = 0.039 , hazard ratio ( HR) = 5.99 and p = 0.040 , HR = 6.08 , respectively) and to a lesser extent , in patients within Up-to-7 criteria ( p = 0.028 , HR = 3.58 and p = 0.039 , HR = 3.33 , respectively). No other significant IRI effects were found in patients beyond the Up-to-7 criteria and in analyses stratified for independent risk factors for recurrence: tumour number and differentiation , alpha-fetoprotein , and microvascular invasion. Thus , IRI exerts major negative effects on the risk of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation in patients within standard and extended criteria.
