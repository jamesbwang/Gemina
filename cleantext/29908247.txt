  In this manuscript , we introduce a linear approximation of the forward model of soft x-ray tomography ( SXT) , such that the reconstruction is solvable by standard iterative schemes. This linear model takes into account the three-dimensional point spread function ( PSF) of the optical system , which consequently enhances the reconstruction data. The feasibility of the model is demonstrated on both simulated and experimental data , based on theoretically estimated and experimentally measured PSFs.
