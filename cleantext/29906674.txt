  The brewery industry generates a large amount of by-products and notably Brewer 's Spent Grain ( BSG) which seems an attractive substrate for anaerobic digestion. Nevertheless , previous studies have shown risk of inhibition in the mono-digestion of lignocellulosic substrates. One way to stabilize the reaction is the addition of trace elements. The current study evaluates and compares the stability of BSG anaerobic mono-digestion with and without addition of trace elements for several BSG samples. Based on the average composition of the BSG , two levels of nutrients addition were defined and tested on 4 different BSG samples. Control reactors , without addition of nutrients , showed signs of instability after 3 months or less of operation , with a decrease in performance and even collapse. On the contrary , supplemented reactors led to a COD removal rate of 60-65 % and a methane production ranged between 220 and 350 NL CH
