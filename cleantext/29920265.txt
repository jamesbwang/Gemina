  Formation of a transport vesicle in membrane trafficking pathways requires deformation of the membrane to form a highly curved structure. A recent study reveals a crucial function for the conical lipid lysophosphatidylinositol in reducing the bending rigidity of the membrane during COPII vesicle budding in the early secretory pathway.
