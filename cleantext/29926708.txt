  The nucleosomal organization of chromatin using histone proteins is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic nuclei , with the major exception of dinoflagellates. Although a number of recent genomic and transcriptomic analysis have detected numerous histone genes in dinoflagellates , however , little is known about their expression. Here , we aimed to investigate expression pattern of histone genes under nutritional stress and an attempt was made to detect histone expression at protein level in
