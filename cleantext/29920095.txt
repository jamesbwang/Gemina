  Neutron diffraction experiments have been performed to investigate and compare the structure of the hydration shell of three monosaccharides , namely , fructose , glucose , and mannose. It is found that despite their differences with respect to many thermodynamical quantities , bioprotective properties against environmental stresses , and taste , the influence of these monosaccharides on the bulk water solvent structure is virtually identical. Conversely , these sugars interact with the neighboring water molecules by forming H bonds of different length and strength. Interestingly , the sweetness of these monosaccharides , along with that of the disaccharide trehalose , is correlated with the length of these H bonds. This suggests that the small differences in stereochemistry between the different sugars determine a relevant change in polarity , which has a fundamental impact on the behavior of these molecules in vivo.
