  Children with low movement proficiency have been identified as having poorer physiological and psychosocial outcomes; however , the varied measurement approaches used to assess these outcomes have varied resulting in conflicting evidence regarding the presence and magnitude of differences compared to Typically Developing ( TD) children. Additionally , there has been limited research into the role of parental support for physical activity ( PA) in this group. We compared children with varying levels of movement proficiency on physiological characteristics and self-perceptions regarding PA.. In addition , these children 's parents were compared on physiological characteristics and support of their children 's PA.. Children ( N = 117) aged 6 to 12 years , along with their parent/guardian , participated in this study. Children were classified according to the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 test ( Typically Developing ( TD) = 60; At Risk = 19; Developmental Coordination Disorder ( DCD) = 38). Children 's PA , muscle strength , cardio-respiratory fitness ( CRF) , body composition , and self-perceptions regarding PA were assessed , with parents assessed on CRF , body composition , and PA support. Compared to TD children , children with DCD had lower PA ( p = 0.036) , predilection ( p ≤ 0.001) and adequacy ( p ≤ 0.001) regarding PA , higher body fat percentage ( p = 0.019) , and received less logistic support ( i.e. , transportation) from their parents ( p = 0.012). TD children had increased muscle strength compared to the DCD ( p ≤ 0.001) and At Risk ( p ≤ 0.001) groups. Results indicated that , relative to TD children , children with DCD have multiple physiological deficits , receive less parental logistic support for PA involvement , and report lower scores on psychological constructs that are predictive of PA involvement.
