  Some halophytes are currently used as gourmet plant ingredients for human consumption. The polar lipidome of the succulent organs of Salicornia ramosissima ( fresh branch tips) and Halimione portulacoides ( leaves) were characterized in-depth , with more than two hundred lipid species being identified in both halophytes. The lipid species identified were distributed over five classes of phospholipids , three classes of glycolipids and one class of glycosphingolipids. Despite the existence of some species-specific differences between the polar lipidome , phospholipids and glycolipids show a high content of n-3 fatty acids in both S. ramosissima and H. portulacoides. These results highlights the advantage of employing mass spectrometry based lipidomic platform towards the valorization of halophytes as a source of valuable nutrients and bioactives , fostering potential applications in the fields of healthy and functional food products , and for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical uses.
