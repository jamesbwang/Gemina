  While inhibitory control of single effector movements has been widely studied , the control of coordinated eye-hand movements has received less attention. Nevertheless , previous studies have contradictorily suggested that either a common or separate signal/s is/are responsible for inhibition of coordinated eye-hand movements. In continuation of our previous study , we varied behavioural contexts and used a stochastic accumulation to threshold model which predicts a scaling of the mean reaction time distribution with its variance , to study the inhibitory control of eye-hand movements. Participants performed eye-hand movements in different task conditions , and in each condition they had to redirect movements in a fraction of trials. Task contexts where the behaviour could be best explained by a common initiation signal had similar error responses for eye and hand , despite having different mean reaction times , indicating a common inhibitory signal. In contrast , behaviour which could be best explained by separate initiation signals had dissimilar error responses for eye and hand indicating separate inhibitory signals. These behavioural responses were further validated using electromyography and computational models having either a common or separate inhibitory control signal/s. Interestingly , in a particular context while in majority trials a common initiation and inhibitory signal could explain the behaviour , in a subset of trials separate initiation and inhibitory signals predicted the behaviour better. This highlights the flexibility that exists in the brain and in effect reconciles the heterogeneous results reported by previous studies.
