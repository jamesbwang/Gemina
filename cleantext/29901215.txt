  Inhibitors of cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP) were developed due to their ability to raise HDL-C levels. Preclinical studies demonstrated favorable effects on atherosclerotic plaque with CETP inhibitory approaches in animal models. While these agents raise HDL-C and lower LDL-C , most have not proven to reduce cardiovascular event rates in large outcome trials. The state of opinion after all of these clinical trials is reviewed.
