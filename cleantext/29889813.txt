  Organ dysfunction remains a major cause of morbidity after trauma. The development of organ dysfunction is determined by the inflammatory response , in which neutrophils are important effector cells. A femoral fracture particularly predisposes for the development of organ dysfunction. This study investigated the chronologic relation between neutrophil characteristics and organ dysfunction in trauma patients with a femoral fracture. Patients with a femoral fracture presenting at the University Medical Center ( UMC) Utrecht between 2007 and 2013 were included. Data of neutrophil characteristics from standard hematological analyzers were recorded on a daily basis until the 28th day of hospital stay or until discharge. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to compare outcome groups. In total 157 patients were analyzed , of whom 81 had polytrauma and 76 monotrauma. Overall mortality within 90 days was 6.4 % ( n = 10). Eleven patients ( 7.0 %) developed organ dysfunction. In patients who developed organ dysfunction a significant increase in neutrophil count ( p = 0.024) , a significant increase in neutrophil cell size ( p = 0.026) , a significant increase in neutrophil complexity ( p < 0.004) and a significant decrease in neutrophil lobularity ( p < 0.001) were seen after trauma. The rise in neutrophil cell size preceded the clinical manifestation of organ dysfunction in every patient. Patients who develop organ dysfunction post injury show changes in neutrophil characteristics before organ dysfunction becomes clinically evident. These findings regarding post-traumatic organ dysfunction may contribute to the development of new prognostic tools for immune mediated complications in trauma patients. Level II , etiologic study.
