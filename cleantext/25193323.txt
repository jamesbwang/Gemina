  Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) is one of the most common causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite recent strides in pharmacotherapy , complete cure of HBV infection still remains an enigma. The biggest obstacle in HBV therapy is clearance of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid ( cccDNA). We discuss about the role of cccDNA in HBV<pathogen> life cycle , efficacy and shortcomings of currently available antivirals as well as promising novel targets to achieve ideal HBV<pathogen> cure.
