  Recent studies have highlighted the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the regulation of muscle satellite cell behavior. Herein we report preclinical studies designed to characterize the effects of a novel JAK/STAT inhibitor on plantar flexor skeletal muscle function , morphology , and satellite cell content. The compound , SGI-1252 , was administered orally ( 400mg/kg) in a 10 % dextrose solution to wild type mice ( n = 6) 3 times per week for 8 weeks. A control group ( n = 6) received only the dextrose solution. SGI-1252 was well tolerated , as animals displayed similar weight gain over the 8-week treatment period. Following treatment , fatigue<symptom> in the gastrocnemius-soleus-plantaris complex was greater in the SGI-1252 mice during a 300 second tetanic contraction bout ( p = 0.035) , though both the rate of fatigue<symptom> and maximal force production were similar. SGI-1252 treated mice had increased type II myofiber cross-sectional area ( 1434.8 ± 225.4 vs 1754.7 ± 138.5 μm2) , along with an increase in wet muscle mass ( 125.45 ± 5.46 vs 139.6 ± 12.34 mg , p = 0.032) of the gastrocnemius relative to vehicle treated mice. SGI-1252 treatment reduced gastrocnemius STAT3 phosphorylation 53 % ( 94.79 ± 45.9 vs 44.5 ± 6.1 MFI) and significantly increased the concentration of Pax7 + satellite cells ( 2589.2 ± 105.5 vs 2859.4 ± 177.5 SC/mm3) in the gastrocnemius. SGI-1252 treatment suppressed MyoD ( p = 0.013) and Myogenin ( p < 0.0001) expression in human primary myoblasts , resulting in reduced myogenic differentiation ( p = 0.039). Orally delivered SGI-1252 was well tolerated , attenuates skeletal muscle STAT3 activity , and increases satellite cell content in mouse gastrocnemius muscle , likely by inhibiting myogenic progression.
