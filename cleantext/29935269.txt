  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS) was used to investigate the stability of resting state functional connectivity ( RSFC) in the prefrontal cortex. In a longitudinal study for investigating the stability of RSFC with time , we recruited 6 healthy adult subjects to undergo a 10-min resting state fNIRS scan once per day for 7 consecutive days. In a cross-sectional study , 62 healthy subjects underwent a single 10-min RSFC measurement. Three regions-of-interest ( ROIs) were studied , the superior frontal gyrus ( SFG) , the middle frontal gyrus ( MFG) , and the inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG). Homologous RSFC between the left and right hemisphere was computed for each ROI. The longitudinal RSFC study showed no significant variation with time in each ROI , implying that a one-time scan was sufficient for evaluating RSFC for an individual. The cross-sectional study showed significant difference in RSFC between SFG and MFG/IFG. Based on these observations , a lower bound of RSFC with an 85 % confidence level for healthy adults was given for each gender: in IFG , 0.6894 ( male) and 0.5392 ( female) , in MFG , 0.6487 ( male) and 0.5713 ( female) , and in SFG: 0.8042 ( male) and 0.7436 ( female). To test ability of the lower bound to differentiate between healthy adults and adults with neurological disorders ( showing weaker RSFC) , 15 patients with affective disorders or sleep disorder were recruited for the resting state scan. The results showed that IFG was the most predictive ROI. This study may help to establish a quantitative range of RSFC for healthy adults and serve as a reference for screening patients with neurological disorders.
