  The development of safe and affordable antiparasitic agents effective against neglected tropical diseases is a big challenge of the drug discovery. The drugs currently employed have limitations such as poor efficacy , drug resistance or side effects. Thus , the search for new promising drugs is more and more crucial. Metal complexes and , in particular , organometallic compounds may expand the list of the drug candidates due to the peculiar attributes that the presence of the metal core add to the organic fragment ( e.g. , redox and structural features , ability to interact with DNA or protein targets , etc.). To date , most organometallic compounds tested as anti-neglected tropical diseases are based on similarities or activity of the organic ligands against other diseases or parasites and/or consist in modification of existing drugs combining the features of the metal moiety and the organic ligands. This review focuses on recent studies ( 2012-2017) on organometallic compounds in treating kinetoplastid-caused diseases such as Human African trypanosomiasis , Chagas disease and leishmaniasis<disease> This field of research , however , still lacks exhaustive studies to identify of parasitic targets and quantitative structure-activity relationships for a rational drug design.
