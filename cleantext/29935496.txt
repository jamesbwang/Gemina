  Theoretical predictions of the three lowest adiabatic and vertical ionization potentials of water were obtained from the Feller-Peterson-Dixon approach. This approach combines multiple levels of coupled cluster theory with basis sets as large as aug-cc-pV8Z in some cases and various corrections up to and including full configuration interaction theory. While agreement with experiment for the adiabatic ionization potential of the lowest energy
