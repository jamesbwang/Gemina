  To investigate the clinical manifestation , therapeutic efficacy and related prognostic factors of patients with follicular lymphoma. A retroretrospective study was conducted on 94 patients with follicular lymphoma who were admitted to our hospital from March 1999 to June 2016. The total of 94 newly diagnosed FL patients were analyzed in terms of clinical manifestation , laboratory data , pathological examination , clinical stage and so on , so as to find out the related prognostic factors. Ninety-four patients were included in this study. The median age at onset was 50.60 years old , more common in women , and ratio of male to female was 1:1.35. The superficial lymphadenopathy<disease> was found to be the first symptom in 72.3 % patients , 25.5 % patients had B symptoms when diagnosed , 57.4 % cases had extranodal organ invasion when diagnosed , of which bone<disease> marrow invasion is the most common , accounting for 36.2 % , followed by the digestive tract , bone , spleen and so on. The detected rate of BCL-2/ IGH gene rearrangement was 33.9 %. Patients with grade 3 of FL accounted for 24.5 %. Cases of clinical stage III-IV accounted for 71.2 % in these FL patients. The overall response rate ( ORR) was 92.0 % , and the complete remission ( CR) rate was 79.3 % and the recurrence rate was 35.2 %. The cumulative overall survival rates of 3 , 5 and 10 years were 92.1 % , 84.6 % and 77.4 % respectively , and the cumulative progression-free survival ( PFS) rate in 3,5 and 10 years was 68.5 % , 61.4 % and 41.9 % , respectively. The results showed that the CR rate was 85.2 % in patients treated with rituximab and 69.7 % in patients treated without rituximab. The OS and PFS in patients treated with rituximab were better than those in patients treated without rituximab , but there was no significant difference between them ( P > 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that FL stage , ECOG score , Hb and LDH levels , digestive tract involvement or not , CR or not after initial treatment had a significant impact on OS ( P < 0.05) , while BCL-2 , CD10 , ECOG score , albumin , Hb and LDH levels , percentage of lymphocytes , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , digestive tract involvement had a significant impact on PFS ( P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that digestive tract involvement or not , CR or not after initial treatment were independent risk factors for OS ( P < 0.05) , while CR or not after initial treatment , digestive tract invdvement or not , LDH level and ECOG score were independent risk factors for PFS ( P < 0.05). The FL is more common in middle-aged women , the FL was in late stage at confirmed diagnosis , bone<disease> marrow involvement is more common. The CD10 negative is poor prognostic factor for FL.. The digestive tract involvement or not , CR or not after initial treatment are independent risk factors for OS , while CR or not after initial treatment , digestive tract involvement or not , LDH level and ECOG score are independent risk factors for PFS.
