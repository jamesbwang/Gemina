  Which health problems do medical general practitioners ( GPs) most commonly refer to physiotherapists? What is the likelihood of GPs referring patients for specific health problems? Secondary analysis of data from the Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health ( BEACH) study , which is a national observational study of Australian general practice clinical activity. People at GP encounters between April 2010 and March 2015. The outcomes were the proportion of all ( new) health problems that were referred to a physiotherapist , the distribution of health problems referred to physiotherapists , and the likelihood of referral of ( all and new) specific health problems to physiotherapists. There were 6904 referrals to a physiotherapist from 775893 GP encounters , which equated to 0.89 % ( 95 % CI 0.86 to 0.92). Among the 286858 new health problems , 2987 were referred to a physiotherapist ( 1.04 % , 95 % CI 0.99 to 1.09). The health problems that were most commonly referred were back complaints ( 18.6 %) , sprains ( 10.3 %) and osteoarthritis ( 8.6 %). However , when these three problems presented as a new health problem , the likelihood of referral was low ( 14.4 , 11.9 and 5.4 % , respectively). The new health problems most likely to result in a referral were acquired deformity of the spine ( which includes kyphoscoliosis , kyphosis , lordosis and scoliosis) ( 17.7 % , 95 % CI 8.2 to 27.2) and neck complaints ( 17.4 % , 95 % CI 14.3 to 20.6). Most referrals made to physiotherapists were for musculoskeletal problems. However , even among the most commonly referred problems ( such as back complaints and osteoarthritis) , the likelihood of referral was low when they presented as a new problem. There is an opportunity to increase referrals from general practice to physiotherapy for many common conditions with effective physiotherapy interventions.
