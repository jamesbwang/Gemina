  Harvesting solar light to boost commercially important organic synthesis still remains a challenge. Coupling of conventional noble metal catalysts with plasmonic oxide materials which exhibit intense plasmon absorption in the visible light region is a promising option for efficient solar energy utilization in catalysis. Herein , we for the first time demonstrate that plasmonic hydrogen molybdenum bronze coupled with Pt nanoparticles ( Pt/H
