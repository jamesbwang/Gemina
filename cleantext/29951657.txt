  Novel and practical acid-catalyzed cyclization of 2-indolyl aryl carbinols via tandem dehydration/1 ,5-hydride shift/7-cyclization sequences has been developed. By appropriate variation of the substrate , diverse polycyclic-fused indoles were synthesized in good yield , thus demonstrating the high efficiency , transition-metal-free nature , and high step/atom economy of the synthesis strategy.
