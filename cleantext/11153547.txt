  In congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) , sympathetic nervous system is hyperactive. This article reviews current understandings about central and peripheral neural mechanisms underlying sympathetic hyperactivation in this pathological condition. During the development of CHF , renin-angiotensin system ( RAS) activities and angiotensin II-mediated oxidative stress become enhanced. Here , on the basis of findings obtained from animal studies , it is examined how RAS overactivation and oxidative stress in central and peripheral nervous systems of CHF mediate sympathetic hyperactivation. Mechanisms by which exercise training in CHF ameliorates RAS overactivation , oxidative stress and sympathetic hyperactivation are also investigated.
