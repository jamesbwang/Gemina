  This is the first volume of the Handbook of Clinical Neurology totally devoted to prion diseases. The reason for this choice is to inform neurologists and neuroscientists about the remarkable advances that this field has made in the diagnosis of human and animal prion diseases , understanding the pathogenesis of disease , and in the development of novel in vivo and in vitro models. In recent years , the knowledge of prion replication and mechanisms of prion spreading within the brain and peripheral organs of infected people has also become important for understanding other protein misfolded diseases of the brain , such as Alzheimer disease , Parkinson disease , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Researchers in these diseases have recognized that the process within an individual leading to the deposition of misfolded proteins within the central nervous system shares remarkable common mechanisms with prion diseases , leading to the terminology of `` prion-like diseases.
