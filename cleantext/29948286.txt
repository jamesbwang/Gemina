  Oral anticoagulation therapy in individuals with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) reduces the risk of thromboembolic events at cost of an increased bleeding risk. Whether anticoagulation-related outcomes differ between patients with paroxysmal and sustained AF receiving anticoagulation is controversially discussed. In the present analysis of the prospective multi-center cohort study thrombEVAL , the incidence of anticoagulation-related adverse events was analyzed according to the AF phenotype. Information on outcome was centrally recorded over 3 years , validated via medical records and adjudicated by an independent review panel. Study monitoring was provided by an independent institution. Overall , the sample comprised 1089 AF individuals , of whom n = 398 had paroxysmal AF and n = 691 experienced sustained AF. In Cox regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders , sustained AF indicated an independently elevated risk of clinically relevant bleeding compared to paroxysmal AF ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.40 ( 1.02; 1.93); P = 0.038). For clinically relevant bleeding , a significant interaction of the pattern of AF type with concomitant heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) was detected: HR In HF patients receiving oral anticoagulation , sustained AF indicates a substantially elevated risk of bleeding. https://clinicaltrials.gov , identifier: NCT01809015.
