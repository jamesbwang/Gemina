  Certain enzymes of the glycoside hydrolase family 20 ( GH20) exert transglycosylation activity and catalyze the transfer of Î²-N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc) from a chitobiose donor to lactose to produce lacto-N-triose II ( LNT2) , a key human milk oligosaccharide backbone moiety. The present work is aimed at increasing the transglycosylation activity of two selected hexosaminidases , HEX1 and HEX2 , to synthesize LNT2 from lactose and chitobiose. Peptide pattern recognition analysis was used to categorize all GH20 proteins in subgroups. On this basis , we identified a series of proteins related to HEX1 and HEX2. By sequence alignment , four additional loop sequences were identified that were not present in HEX1 and HEX2. Insertion of these loop sequences into the wild-type sequences induced increased transglycosylation activity for three out of eight mutants. The best mutant , HEX1
