  Human<pathogen> metapneumovirus<pathogen> ( hMPV) utilizes a bifurcated cellular entry strategy , fusing either with the plasma membrane or , after endocytosis , with the endosome membrane. Whether cellular factors restrict or enhance either entry pathway is largely unknown. We found that the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 ( IFITM3) inhibits hMPV infection to an extent similar to endocytosis-inhibiting drugs , and an IFITM3 variant that accumulates at the plasma membrane in addition to its endosome localization provided increased virus restriction. Mechanistically , IFITM3 blocks hMPV F protein-mediated membrane fusion , and inhibition of infection was reversed by the membrane destabilizing drug amphotericin B. Conversely , we found that infection by some hMPV strains is enhanced by the endosomal protein Toll-like receptor 7 ( TLR7) , and that IFITM3 retains the ability to restrict hMPV infection even in cells expressing TLR7. Overall , our results identify IFITM3 as an endosomal restriction factor that limits hMPV infection of cells.
