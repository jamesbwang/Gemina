  The aim of this study was to quantitatively analyze quite standing postural stability of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS) patients in respect to three sensory systems ( visual , vestibular , and somatosensory). In this study , we analyzed the anterior-posterior center of pressure ( CoP) signal using discrete wavelet transform ( DWT) between AIS patients ( n = 32) and normal controls ( n = 25) during quiet standing. The energy rate ( âˆ† E This implies that AIS patients use strategies to compensate for possible head position changes and spinal asymmetry caused by morphological deformations of the spine through vestibular and somatosensory systems. This could be interpreted that such compensation could help them maintain postural stability during quiet standing. The interpretation of CoP signal during quiet standing in AIS patients will improve our understanding of changes in physical exercise ability due to morphological deformity of the spine. This result is useful for evaluating postural stability before and after treatments ( spinal fusion , bracing , rehabilitation , and so on).
