  DNA mismatch repair ( MMR) pathways coordinate the excision and re-synthesis of newly-replicated DNA if a mismatched base-pair has been identified by protein MutS or MutS homologues ( MSHs) after replication. DNA excision during MMR is initiated at single-strand breaks ( SSBs) in vitro , and several redundant processes have been observed in reconstituted systems which either require a pre-formed SSB in the DNA or require a mismatch-activated nicking endonuclease to introduce a SSB in order to initiate MMR. However , the conditions under which each of these processes may actually occur in living cells have remained obscured by the limitations of current MMR assays. Here we use a novel assay involving chemically-modified oligonucleotide probes to insert targeted DNA ` mismatches ' directly into the genome of living bacteria to interrogate their replication-coupled repair processes quantitatively in a strand- , orientation- , and mismatched nucleotide-specific manner. This ` semi-protected oligonucleotide recombination ' ( SPORE) assay reveals direct evidence in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> of an efficient endonuclease-independent MMR process on the lagging strand-a mechanism that has long-since been considered for lagging-strand repair but never directly shown until now. We find endonuclease-independent MMR is coordinated asymmetrically with respect to the replicating DNA-directed primarily from 3 '- of the mismatch-and that repair coordinated from 3 '- of the mismatch is in fact the primary mechanism of lagging-strand MMR. While further work is required to explore and identify the molecular requirements for this alternative endonuclease-independent MMR pathway , these findings made possible using the SPORE assay are the first direct report of this long-suspected mechanism in vivo.
