  Depression<symptom> is the most frequent mental disorder during pregnancy , and its prevalence is at least as high as that of postnatal depression<symptom> Differences between Western and Eastern countries may exist according to cultural and educational factors. to determine the influence of social and cultural factors on the mood state of a multicultural sample of 514 Turkish and Spanish pregnant women at the beginning of the pregnancy. Between October and December 2017 250 Turkish and 264 Spanish pregnant women attending their first pregnancy medical check-up between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy were recruited ( 264 in MÃ¡laga , 102 in Istanbul and 148 in Antalya). These women completed a questionnaire that included the Turkish or Spanish validated versions of the Edinburg Postnatal Depression<symptom> Scale ( EDS) and a series of questions related to health status , general mood , and sociodemographic variables. Turkish women scored significantly higher with a mean value of 12.1 ( SD 4.2) against 7.6 ( SD 4.3) of Spanish women. Coping strategies and matters of women 's concern were also different. A total of 9.1 % of Spanish and 30 % of Turkish scored over cut-off point of 13. We found differences in EDS scores regarding the type of work , working status , and educational level. Family structure and perceived support were identified as specific risk factors for antenatal depression<symptom> ( AD). The multivariate regression model showed that best predictor variables for EDS score in the global sample were the country of recruitment , the number of living children , the pregnancy planning and the perceived partner 's support. Our results confirm the existence of important differences in AD prevalence between Turkish ( 30.0 %) and Spanish ( 9.9 %) pregnant women. Some sociocultural features like having more children , unplanned pregnancies , or perceiving poor support from the partner , become important vulnerability factors.
