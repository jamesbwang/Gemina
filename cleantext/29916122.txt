  To evaluate a relation between the outer nuclear layer ( ONL) thickness and symptom duration in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC) using spectraldomain optical coherence tomography ( SDOCT) and to compare with healthy subjects. This retrospective study included 67 CSC patients and 20 healthy subjects. The ONL thickness was measured between internal limiting membrane and external limiting membrane at central fovea using SD-OCT ( Topcon 3D OCT-2000 , Japan). The patients were divided into six groups based on symptom duration: group ( 1) contained 14 patients ( symptom duration between 1 and 30 days) , group ( 2) contained 11 patients ( symptom duration between 31 and 60 days) , group ( 3) contained 12 patients ( symptom duration between 61 and 90 days) , group ( 4) contained 11 ( symptom duration between 91 and 120 days) , group ( 5) contained 7 patients ( symptom duration between 121 and 150 days) and group ( 6) contained 12 ( symptom duration between 151 days and more). The average ONL thickness was 76.1 ± 16.8 μm in CSC in all patients and 122.4 ± 2.8 μm in healthy subjects. The major differences were between group ( 3) and ( 4) ( p < 0.001). The ONL thickness was negatively correlated with symptom duration ( rs =- 0.918; p < 0.001). In addition , the ONL thickness was positively correlated with BCVA ( rs = 0.619; p < 0.001). Photoreceptor loss could begin within the first 3 months in CSC.
