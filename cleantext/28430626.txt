  As the current efficacy of oncolytic viruses ( OVs) as monotherapy is limited , exploration of OVs as part of a broader immunotherapeutic treatment strategy for cancer is necessary. Here , we investigated the ability for immune checkpoint blockade to enhance the efficacy of oncolytic reovirus ( RV) for the treatment of breast cancer ( BrCa). In vitro , oncolysis and cytokine production were assessed in human and murine BrCa cell lines following RV exposure. Furthermore , RV-induced upregulation of tumor cell PD-L1 was evaluated. In vivo , the immunocompetent , syngeneic EMT6 murine model of BrCa was employed to determine therapeutic and tumor-specific immune responses following treatment with RV , anti-PD-1 antibodies or in combination. RV-mediated oncolysis and cytokine production were observed following BrCa cell infection and RV upregulated tumor cell expression of PD-L1. In vivo , RV monotherapy significantly reduced disease burden and enhanced survival in treated mice , and was further enhanced by PD-1 blockade. RV therapy increased the number of intratumoral regulatory T cells , which was reversed by the addition of PD-1 blockade. Finally , dual treatment led to the generation of a systemic adaptive anti-tumor immune response evidenced by an increase in tumor-specific IFN - & gamma; producing CD8 ‚Å∫ T cells , and immunity from tumor re-challenge. The combination of PD-1 blockade and RV appears to be an efficacious immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of BrCa , and warrants further investigation in early-phase clinical trials.
