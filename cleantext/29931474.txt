  Our insight in the genetics of Hashimoto 's thyroiditis ( HT) has become clearer through information provided by genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies , but remains still not fully understood. Our aim was to assess how many different genetic risk variants contribute to the development of HT. 147 HT cases ( 10.2 % men) and 147 controls ( 13.6 % men) were qualified for the analysis. Intrinsic and environmental factors were controlled for. Polymorphisms ( SNP) were chosen based on the literature and included markers of the genes PTPN22 , CTLA4 , TG , TPO among others , and of genomic regions pointed by GWAS studies. SNP were typed on a microarray. Variants in the HLA-DRB1 gene were identified by Sanger sequencing. Multivariate predisposition to HT was modeled. Based on the investigated group , a model of seven variables was obtained. The variability explained by this model was assessed at only 5.4821 % ( p = 2 Ã— 10 We analyzed genetic regions commonly and most significantly associated with autoimmune thyroid disorders in the literature , on a carefully selected cohort. Our results indicated a lack of possibility to predict the risk of HT development , even with a multivariate model. We therefore conclude that strong associations of single genetic regions with HT should be interpreted with great caution. We believe that a change in the attitude towards genetic association analyses of HT predisposition is necessary. Studies including multiple factors simultaneously are needed to unravel the intricacies of genetic associations with HT.
