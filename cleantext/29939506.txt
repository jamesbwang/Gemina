  Asthma is a costly and variable disease necessitating routine population health monitoring. Insurance claims represent all paid pharmacy , diagnostic , outpatient , inpatient , and emergency care; however , current claims-based identification tools may be overly specific. We sought to determine how various definitions of asthma may improve detection of patients at risk of asthma exacerbations. A statistical analysis of private insurance claims for patients in a pediatric primary care network in Massachusetts. We performed a retrospective statistical analysis for patients aged 2 to 18 years with 3 years of continuous enrollment. Multiple potential definitions were constructed and tested on 2 years of data against their ability to identify patients having an exacerbation in the third year. Definitions tested utilized patterns of medication fills and visits billed with a diagnosis of asthma , wheeze , or cough<symptom> We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of each definition and constructed a receiver operating characteristic curve. In a cohort of 28,363 patients , a definition identifying patients with 1 or more clinician visits with a diagnosis of asthma or wheeze over 2 years was most efficient in detecting patients with an exacerbation in the subsequent year ( sensitivity , 0.78; specificity , 0.84). When tested on the same cohort , the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ( HEDIS) persistent asthma criteria were less sensitive but more specific ( sensitivity , 0.20; specificity , 0.99). Population health registries and quality measurement may benefit from using a claims-based definition of pediatric patients at risk of asthma exacerbations that is not as restrictive as the HEDIS persistent asthma criteria.
