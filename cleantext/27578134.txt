  Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia ( HoFH) is characterized by a markedly increased risk of premature cardiovascular ( CV) events and cardiac death. Lomitapide reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) levels; however , the probable impact on LDL-C goals and CV events is unknown. We used data collected in the first 26 weeks of the lomitapide pivotal phase 3 study ( NCT00730236) to evaluate achievement of European Atherosclerosis Society ( EAS) LDL-C targets. We used publicly available data reporting major adverse CV events ( MACE) rates from other cohorts of HoFH patients to compare event rates for an equivalent number of patient years of exposure ( 98) in the lomitapide extension trial ( NCT00943306). Twenty-nine patients were included in the phase 3 study. During the first 26 weeks , 15 ( 51 %) and eight ( 28 %) reached LDL-C targets of 100 mg/dL and 70 mg/dL , respectively , at least once. Fourteen ( 74 %) and 11 ( 58 %) of the 19 patients who remained in the extension study after week 126 reached LDL-C targets of 100 mg/dL and 70 mg/dL at least once during the entire study period. Only two MACE were reported in the lomitapide trials ( one cardiac death and one coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG))- equivalent to 1.7 events per 1000 patient months of treatment. MACE rates were 21.7 , 9.5 and 1.8 per 1000 patient-months respectively in cohorts of HoFH patients pre- and post-mipomersen , and receiving evolocumab. On treatment LDL-C levels were 166 , 331 and 286 mg/dL for lomitapide , mipomersen and evolocumab , respectively. Approximately three quarters and half of patients who took lomitapide for at least 2 years reached LDL-C goals of 100 mg/dL and 70 mg/dL , respectively. There were fewer major CV events per 1000 patient months of treatment in patients taking lomitapide , mipomersen or evolocumab than reported in the mipomersen cohort prior to starting mipomersen. These results support the hypothesis that novel lipid-lowering therapies may reduce CV events in HoFH patients by lowering LDL-C further.
