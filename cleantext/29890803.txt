  To evaluate the short-term result for the treatment of distal radius fracture with manual resetting and fixing with small splint. From January 2015 to December 2016 , 60 cases of distal radial fractures were treated by manual resetting and small splint fixation including 39 males and 21 females with an average age of ( 43.50 ± 10.56) years old ranging from 18 to 65 years old. According to AO classification , 38 cases were type A , 19 cases were type B , 3 cases were type C. The anteroposterior and lateral X-ray of the wrist joint was performed before reduction , 1 , 2 , 4 weeks after reduction , and the removal of the small splint , the palm inclination angle , ulnar deviation angle and radius height were measured. At 8 , 24 and 48 weeks after reduction , the wrist extensor , palmar flexion , pronation , supination , ulnar deviation and radial deviation were measured. Wrist strength was measured at 4 , 8 , 24 and 48 weeks after fracture reduction. After the distal radius fracture healed , the splint support was removed. After dismantling small splint steel support , Mayo score of wrist joint was performed. All cases of distal radius fractures were followed up , the healing time of fracture was 6 to 8 ( 7.1 ± 0.9) weeks. The difference of palmar obliquity , ulnar deviation angle and radius shortening between before reduction and 2 weeks after reduction was statistically significant. There was no significant difference in palmar inclination , ulnar deviation and radius shortening between 2 and 4 weeks after reduction. After 24 weeks and 8 weeks , 48 weeks and 24 weeks after reduction , there was significant difference in wrist extensor , palmar flexion , pronation , supination , ulnar deviation and radial deviation. The grip strength was statistically significant between after reduction and 4 weeks after reduction , 8 weeks and 4 weeks after reduction , 16 weeks and 8 weeks after reduction , 24 and 16 weeks after reduction. There was no significant difference in grip strength between 48 weeks and 24 weeks after reduction. The Mayo wrist function scoring system was used to evaluate the curative effect , the results were excellent in 50 cases , good in 8 cases , fair in 1 case and poor in 1 case. The treatment of distal radius fracture with the method of manual resetting and fixing with plywood is simple and the clinical efficacy is accurate.
