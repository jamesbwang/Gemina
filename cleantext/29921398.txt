  This study aimed to observe the safety and effectiveness of different dosing regimens of low molecular weight heparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) and to provide a guideline for the treatment of individualized VTE prophylaxisin patients with postoperative gastrointestinal tumors. Forty patients with high risk for VTE after surgery for gastrointestinal tumors treated in Hongqi Hospital of Mudanjiang Medical University in the period October 2016 to May 2017 were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups , group A that included 24 patients treated with low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH) 5000 IU every 12 hours , and group B comprised of 16 patients treated with LMWH 5000IU every 24 hours. On the seventh day post-surgery anti-Xa activity values reached effective anticoagulation ( > 0.5 IU/mL) in both groups. In group A , there was one case of anti-Xa activity exceeding 1.0 IU/mL , but no bleeding complications occurred. Using LMWH 5000 IU subcutaneous injection every 12 hours could also prevent postoperative VTE of gastrointestinal tumor , but the risk of bleeding complications is higher compared with 24-hour administration. Monitoring of plasma D-dimer within 7 days after gastrointestinal surgery did not show a great value for VTE monitoring. This study demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of LMWH can prevent VTE after gastrointestinal tumor surgery and provide a new alternative for VTE prevention.
