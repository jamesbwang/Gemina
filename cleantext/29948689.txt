  Membrane distillation is getting increasing attention thanks to its advantages in terms of energy consumption and final permeate quality in addition to its resistance against highly corrosive media which forms an appealing solution for industrial wastewater treatment. Despite its advantages , one of the most challenging issues in direct contact membrane distillation ( DCMD) is membrane fouling and wetting. In the present research work , saline dairy effluent discharged from hard cheese industry was pretreated by macrofiltration ( MAF) and ultrafiltration ( UF) and processed by DCMD to investigate the extent of the aforementioned issues. Effluents pretreated by UF have led the best process performance with stable flux values at different operating conditions. Fouling has occurred in all the experiments , though their effect on the flux behavior and membrane wetting was different from one feed<symptom> to the other. Changing the flow rate and the temperature difference have affected slightly the membrane wettability for all feed qualities. In all experiments , the permeate has maintained a good quality with low electrical conductivity that did not exceed 70 Î¼S/cm and low total organic carbon < 2 mg/L.
