  Nontargeted analysis is a useful strategy for the discovery of unknown risk compounds. However , how to rapidly screen and determine risk substances is still a big challenge. In this study based on high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC)- high resolution mass spectrometry ( HRMS) , a strategy for the rapid screening and determination of risk substances was established. First , the distribution characteristic of every feature from HRMS in all samples was studied by the mean deviation ratio ( MDR) calculation. Features with MDR more than 20 were thought to be the first match of obvious suspected substances. Second , the structure characteristics of specific classes of substances which were summarized from our in-house risk substance ( IHRS) database with about 500 different additives and drugs were used to rapidly screen the unknown suspected substances with specific structure classes. To further identify the above suspected risk substances , IHRS retrieval was carried out. For the unknown features not included in IHRS database , the exclusion of endogenous substances and multiple network databases searching were first performed , and the remaining substances had to be identified with comprehensive methods. To test the usefulness of the established screening and identification method , 42 meat samples were analyzed and 6 risk substances were discovered and identified , with the usefulness of the method confirmed.
