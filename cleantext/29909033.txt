  In order to improve the enzymological properties and to enhance the stability of pepsin ( PP , EC 3.4.23.1) , chitooligosaccharide ( COS) was used to chemically modify enzyme molecules of PP. The results showed that one protein band appeared on the PAGE diagram , indicating that the enzyme samples reached electrophoresis purity after purification. The molecular weights of the enzymes before ( PP) and after ( COS-PP) modification were 38.68 KD and 49.55 KD , respectively. The K
