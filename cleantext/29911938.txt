  OBJECTIVE To evaluate quality of recovery from general anesthesia in horses after induction with propofol and ketamine versus midazolam and ketamine. DESIGN Prospective randomized crossover study. ANIMALS 6 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES Horses were premedicated with xylazine ( 1.0 mg/kg ( 0.45 mg/lb) , IV) , and general anesthesia was induced with midazolam ( 0.1 mg/kg ( 0.045 mg/lb) , IV) or propofol ( 0.5 mg/kg ( 0.23 mg/lb) , IV) , followed by ketamine ( 3.0 mg/kg ( 1.36 mg/lb) , IV). Horses were endotracheally intubated , and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. After 60 minutes , horses were given romifidine ( 0.02 mg/kg ( 0.009 mg/lb) , IV) and allowed to recover unassisted. Times to first movement , sternal recumbency<symptom> , and standing and the number of attempts to stand were recorded. Plasma concentrations of propofol or midazolam were measured following induction and immediately before recovery. Recovery quality was scored by 3 graders with a recovery rubric and a visual analog scale. RESULTS Number of attempts to stand was significantly lower when horses received propofol ( median , 2; range , 1 to 3) than when they received midazolam ( median , 7.5; range , 3 to 16). For both the recovery rubric and visual analog scale , recovery quality was significantly better when horses received propofol than when they received midazolam. Plasma drug concentration at recovery , as a percentage of the concentration at induction , was significantly lower when horses received propofol than when they received midazolam. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that for horses undergoing short ( ie , 60 minutes) periods of general anesthesia , recovery quality may be better following induction with propofol and ketamine , compared with midazolam and ketamine.
