  We investigate wetting phenomena near graphene within the Dzyaloshinskii-Lifshitz-Pitaevskii theory for light gases of hydrogen , helium , and nitrogen in three different geometries where graphene is either affixed to an insulating substrate , submerged or suspended. We find that the presence of graphene has a significant effect in all configurations. When placed on a substrate , the polarizability of graphene can increase the strength of the total van der Waals force by a factor of 2 near the surface , enhancing the propensity towards wetting. In a suspended geometry unique to two-dimensional materials , where graphene is able to wet on only one side , liquid film growth becomes arrested at a critical thickness , which may trigger surface instabilities and pattern formation analogous to spinodal dewetting. The existence of a mesoscopic critical film with a tunable thickness provides a platform for the study of a continuous wetting transition , as well as the engineering of custom liquid coatings. These phenomena are robust to some mechanical deformations and are also universally present in doped graphene and other two-dimensional materials , such as monolayer dichalcogenides.
