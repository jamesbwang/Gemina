  An array of heterobimetallic Pd/Ln MOFs ( 1-4) with Sm , Eu , Tb , Dy as preferred metal nodes and 1,1 '- di ( p-carboxybenzyl) -2,2 '- diimidazole ( H2L) as a fairly suitable bifunctional organic linker have been synthesized , fully characterized and tested as catalysts in cross-coupling reactions. These robust MOFs , ensuring a uniform distribution of Pd , showed excellent stability in air and high catalytic activity in Suzuki-Miyaura reactions conducted in neat water , neat ethanol as well as water-ethanol mixture. Depending on the solvent , complex 1 could be effectively recycled 4-8 times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Importantly , this complex was found to be pH responsive in a reversible way , enabling convenient recovery from acidic aqueous solutions , indicating good recyclability as well as environment-friendly separation of the metal residues after the reaction.
