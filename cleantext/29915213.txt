  Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ( mt-aaRSs) are a family of enzymes that play critical roles in protein biosynthesis. Mutations in mt-aaRSs are associated with various diseases. As a member of the mt-aaRS family , PARS2 encoding prolyl-tRNA synthetase 2 was recently shown to be associated with Alpers syndrome<disease> and certain infantile-onset neurodegenerative disorders in four patients. Here , we present two patients in a pedigree with early developmental delay , epileptic spasms , delayed myelination combined with cerebellar white matter abnormalities , and progressive cortical atrophy. Whole-exome sequencing revealed pathogenic compound heterozygous variants ( c. 283 G > A ( p. 95 V > I)) and ( c. 604 G > C ( p. 202 R > G)) in PARS2. Nearly all patients had epileptic spasms with early response to treatment , early developmental delay and/or regression followed by generalized hypotonia , postnatal microcephaly , elevated lactate levels , and progressive cerebral atrophy. Our study provides further evidence for validating the role of PARS2 in the pathology of related infantile-onset encephalopathy , contributing to the phenotypic features of this condition , and providing clinical and molecular insight for the diagnosis of this disease entity.
