  A clinical isolate of Citrobacter<pathogen> freundii<pathogen> ( JA99) obtained from a bile culture of a Taiwanese patient was found to produce a plasmid-encoded β-lactamase conferring resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and cephamycins. Resistance arising from production of the β-lactamase could be transferred by conjugation with an IncW plasmid ( pJA99) into Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> J53. The substrate and inhibition profiles of this enzyme resembled that of an AmpC β-lactamase. The resistance gene of pJA99 , cloned and expressed in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> DH5α , was shown to contain an open reading frame showing 92 % amino acid identity with the plasmid-encoded enzyme CFE-1 of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> KU6400. DNA sequence analysis also identified a gene upstream of ampC in pJA99 whose sequence was 95.0 % identical to the ampR gene from E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> KU6400. In addition , orf1 , the fumarate operon ( frdABCD) , blc , lolB and repB surrounding the ampR-ampC genes in C.<pathogen> freundii<pathogen> were identified. This DNA fragment was absent in other Citrobacter<pathogen> spp.. Therefore , we describe a new plasmid-encoded AmpC β-lactamase , named CFE-2. This study highlights the emergence of broad-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in C.<pathogen> freundii<pathogen> owing to a new type of AmpC β-lactamase.
