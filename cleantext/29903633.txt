  Despite diagnostic refinements , pancreatic resection ( PR) is eventually performed in some patients with asymptomatic serous cystadenoma ( A-SCA). The aim of this study was to define incidence and reasons of PR in A-SCA. A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed for all the patients referred for pancreatic cystic lesions<symptom> ( PCL) between January 2005 and March 2016. Overall , there were 1488 patients with PCL , including 1271 ( 85.4 %) with incidental PCL ( I-PCL). During the study period referral of I-PCL increased 8.5-fold. Surgery was immediately advised in 94 I-PCL ( 7.3 %) and became necessary later on in 11 additional patients ( 0.9 %) , because of the development of symptoms. Overall , PR was performed in 105/1271 patients presenting with I-PCL ( 8.2 %) , including 27 with A-SCA ( 2.1 %). All patients with A-SCA underwent ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 21 patients ( 77.8 %) , 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography in 8 ( 29.6 %) , endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS) in 2 ( 7.4 %) , and EUS-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA) in 1 ( 3.7 %). These studies demonstrated a combination of atypical features such as solid tumor ( 3; 11.1 %) , oligo-/ macrocystic tumor ( 24; 88.8 %) , mural nodules<symptom> ( 14; 51.8 %) , enhancing cyst<symptom> walls ( 17; 62.9 %) , dilation of the main pancreatic duct ( 3; 11.1 %) , and upstream pancreatic atrophy ( 1; 3.7 %). Additionally , 14/27 patients ( 51.8 %) were females with oligo-/ macrocystic tumors located in the body-tail of the pancreas. Management of patients with A-SCA entails a small risk of PR especially when these tumors demonstrate atypical radiologic features associated with confounding anatomic and demographic characteristics.
