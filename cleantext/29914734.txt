  Previous work has emphasized that cognitive functions in the human brain are organized into large-scale networks. However , the mechanisms that allow these networks to compensate for focal disruptions remain elusive. I suggest a new perspective on the compensatory flexibility of cognitive networks. First , I demonstrate that cognitive networks can rapidly change the functional weight of the relative contribution of different regions. Second , I argue that there is an asymmetry in the compensatory potential of different kinds of networks. Specifically , recruitment of domain-general functions can partially compensate for focal disruptions of specialized cognitive functions , but not vice versa. Considering the compensatory potential within and across networks will increase our understanding of functional adaptation and reorganization after brain lesions<symptom> and offers a new perspective on large-scale neural network ( re-) organization.
