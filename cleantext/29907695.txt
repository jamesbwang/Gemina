  Recent data showed that cancer cells from different tumor subtypes with distinct metastatic potential influence each other 's metastatic behavior by exchanging biomolecules through extracellular vesicles ( EVs). However , it is debated how small amounts of cargo can mediate this effect , especially in tumors where all cells are from one subtype , and only subtle molecular differences drive metastatic heterogeneity. To study this , we have characterized the content of EVs shed
