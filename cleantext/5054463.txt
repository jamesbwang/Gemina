  The objective was to evaluate the effect of replacing milk with soymilk or calcium-fortified soymilk as a part of a meal on postprandial serum phosphorus levels. This study had a randomized crossover design. Ten healthy subjects were enrolled and consumed three test meals that contained either milk , soymilk , or calcium-fortified soymilk containing the same amount of calcium as milk. Blood samples were collected at 0 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 240 and 360 min and urine samples were collected from 0 to 360 min after consuming the test meal. Serum phosphorus levels decreased the most after the ingestion of the soymilk meal , and the least after the ingestion of the milk meal. After the ingestion of each meal , serum intact parathyroid hormone levels showed an initial drop followed by a gradual rise , and these changes were more pronounced for the soymilk meal than for the milk meal and the soymilk + calcium meal. Our study shows that replacing milk with soymilk as a part of a meal may suppress the postprandial elevation in serum phosphorus levels , even when the soymilk contains the same amount of calcium as milk.
