  To establish the detection method for poppy codeine in seasoning power based on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA ( LAMP). Establishment of the LAMP reaction system and detection of 8 commercially seasoning powders by the specificity test , optimum temperature test and sensitivity test of DNA samples of 12 poppies seeds , 11 spices leaves or seeds and 1 corn poppy seeds based on the specific genes sequence of codeine. The DNA samples of the 12 poppies and the corn poppy showed the specific reaction , the optimum temperature was 66 ℃ and the minimum detectable concentration was 9 pg/μL , and the sensitivity was 100 times larger than that of PCR. There was codeine in one of the 8 commercially seasoning powders. The LAMP method applies to detect the poppy in seasoning powders with its high sensitivity , strong specificity , easy operation.
