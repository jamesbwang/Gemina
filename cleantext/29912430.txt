  Although plasticity of growth rates is mainly associated with ectotherm species , it does occur in endotherms as well , but has not been documented systematically for many species. We compared the effect of two common types of feeding systems , differing in energetic value , on body size and gastrointestinal tract morphology in nutrias ( Myocastor coypus). A total of 30 extensively ( E) fed and 20 intensively ( I) fed animals were used in the study. We noted significant effects of age , sex and feeding regime on body<symptom> weight and length , with one-year-old females attaining 3.7 ± 0.4 kg and 33.4 ± 1.5 cm on E and 4.9 ± 0.3 kg and 36.1 ± 2.3 cm on I. A significant treatment-sex interaction indicated that treatment had a greater effect on the length growth in males ( one-year-old males attaining 4.0 ± 0.2 kg and 34.7 ± 1.2 cm on E and 5.4 ± 0.4 kg and 41.0 ± 1.4 cm on I). The differences matched individual literature reports of free-ranging or intensively fed nutrias. The majority of gastrointestinal tract measurement results were only related to body<symptom> weight , without additional effect of the diet regime , except for a higher small intestinal tissue weight on I ( 79 ± 14 g vs 61 ± 7 g on E). In contrast , the wet content weight of the stomach , caecum and the total gastrotinestinal tract was higher on E ( 196 ± 34 g vs 164 ± 51 g on I). Overall we observed strong influence of dietary regime on body development but not on digestive anatomy , indicating a distinct phenotypic flexibility in growth rates in nutrias.
