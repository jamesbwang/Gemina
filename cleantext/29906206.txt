  Advances in computer-aided design ( CAD)/ computer-aided manufacturing ( CAM) technologies and their ease of application enabled the development of novel treatment concepts for modern prosthodontics. This recent paradigm shift in fixed prosthodontics from traditional to minimally invasive treatment approaches is evidenced by the clinical long-term success of bonded CAD/CAM glass-ceramic restorations. Today , defect-oriented restorations , such as inlays , onlays , and posterior crowns , are predominately fabricated from glass-ceramics in monolithic application. The variety of CAD/CAM ceramic restorative systems is constantly evolving to meet the increased demands for highly aesthetic , biocompatible , and long-lasting restorations. Recently introduced polymer-infiltrated ceramic network CAD/CAM blocks add innovative treatment options in CAD/CAM chairside 1-visit restorations. The material-specific high-edge stability enables the CAD/CAM machinability of thin restoration margins. Full-contour zirconia restorations are constantly gaining market share at the expense of bilayered systems. Advancements in material science and bonding protocols foster the development of novel material combinations or fabrication techniques of proven high-strength zirconia ceramics. CAD/CAM applications offer a standardized manufacturing process resulting in a reliable , predictable , and economic workflow for individual and complex teeth-supported restorations. More evidence from long-term clinical studies is needed to verify the clinical performance of monolithic polymer-infiltrated ceramic network and zirconia teeth-supported minimally invasive and extensive restorations.
