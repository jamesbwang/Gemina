  Treatment modalities for neonates born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH) have greatly improved in recent times with a concomitant increase in survival. In 2008 , CDH EURO consortium , a collaboration of a large volume of CDH centers in Western Europe , was established with a goal to standardize management and facilitate multicenter research. However , limited knowledge on long-term outcomes restricts the identification of optimal care pathways for CDH survivors in adolescence and adulthood. This review aimed to evaluate the current practice of long-term follow-up within the CDH EURO consortium centers , and to review the literature on long-term outcomes published from 2000 onward. Apart from having disease-specific morbidities , children with CDH are at risk for impaired neurodevelopmental problems and failure of educational attainments which may affect participation in society and the quality of life in later years. Thus , there is every reason to offer them long-term multidisciplinary follow-up programs. We discuss a proposed collaborative project using standardized clinical assessment and management plan ( SCAMP) methodology to obtain uniform and standardized follow-up of CDH patients at an international level.
