  Intake of dietary sources of collagen may support the synthesis of collagen in varying tissues , with the availability of key amino acids being a likely contributor to its effectiveness. This study analyzed commonly consumed preparations of bone broth ( BB) to assess the amount and consistency of its amino acid content. Commercial and laboratory prepared samples , made with standardized and variable ( non-standardized) protocols were analyzed for key amino acids ( glycine , lysine , proline , leucine , hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine). The main finding of the study was that amino acid concentrations in BB made to a standardized recipe were significantly lower for hydroxyproline , glycine , proline; P = 0.003 and hydroxylysine , leucine and lysine; P = 0.004 than those provided by a potentially therapeutic dose ( 20 g) of reference collagen supplements ( P > 0.05). There was large variability in the amino acid content of BB made to non-standardized recipes , with the highest levels of all amino acids found within the cafÃ© prepared varieties. For standardized preparations , commercial BB were lower in all amino acids than the self-prepared varieties. There were no differences ( P > 0.05) in the amino acid content of different batches of BB when prepared according to a standardized recipe. If the intake of collagen precursors is proven to support the synthesis of new collagen in vivo , it 's unlikely that bone broth can provide a consistently reliable source of key amino acids. Focus on the provision of key amino acids from dietary sources should continue to focus on the standard sources currently being researched.
