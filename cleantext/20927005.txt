  To research the possibility of designing customized 3D printing fingerboard to apply to the limb rehabilitation of cerebral stroke patients as well as the prevention and treatment of finger spasm , through 3D printing technology. Taking 18 hospitalized cerebral stroke patients for example , through scanning , molding and printing , to make and wear 3D printing fingerboard for them , and then observe the compliance , main complaint , muscular tension of affected hand and changes on range of motion after they wear the fingerboard for 3 weeks and 3 months. Have acquired completed data from 13 patients. The time of them wearing the fingerboard every day varied from 1 to 8 h , and most of them reflected that they felt comfortable and there was no feeling of worsened pain or finger skin allergy. In addition , the patients ' grip strength , hand function and range of motion improved by varying degrees while their muscular tensions declined by varying degrees. The tension and bending resistance of the fingerboard all met the patients ' treatment requirements. With the advantages of being accurate and customized , 3D printing fingerboard can benefit patients fixing and orthopedic treatment , and even prevent and treat cerebral stroke patient 's finger spasm.
