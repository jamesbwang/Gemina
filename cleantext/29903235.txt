  To study the effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles ( CeO_2 NPs) on cognitive function in 48 hours of sleep deprived male mice and explore its mechanism. Thirty-six healthy clean ICR male mice ( four weeks old) were randomly divided into 6 groups: blank control group , solvent control group , sleep deprivation control group , low , medium and high dose groups of CeO_2 NPs. 1 m L of distilled water were given to mice of blank group , 1 m L of solvent were given to mice of solvent control and sleep deprivation control group , 1 mL of CeO_2 NPs solvent ( 4 , 8 , 16 mg/kg) were administered to mice of low , medium and high dose groups of CeO_2 NPs. Each group of mice received intragastric administration for 30 days. On the 31 st day , a single platform water environment method was used for 48 hours of sleep deprivation on mice. Then , the cognitive ability of the mice was tested by Y-maze. Further , the antioxidant ( CAT , MDA , T-AOC) and neurotransmitters ( NO , Glu) in mice brain tissue were measured also. Compare with the solvent control group , 48 hours of sleep deprivation reduced the cognitive ability of mice ( ( 36 ± 2) times vs. ( 20 ± 2) times , P = 0. 0006; 10. 753 % ± 0. 031 % vs. 24. 927 % ± 0. 972 % , P = 0. 00000045) , CAT activity ( ( 78. 151 ± 17. 683) nmol/mg prot vs. ( 198. 155 ± 14. 437) nmol/mg prot , P = 0. 0008) and the level of T-AOC ( ( 103. 630 ± 24. 209) U/mg prot vs. ( 264. 599 ± 50. 223) U/mg prot , P = 0. 007) , but improved the content of MDA ( ( 9. 499 ± 1. 249) nmol/mg prot vs. ( 6. 157 ± 0. 373) nmol/mg prot , P = 0. 0113) , NO ( ( 11. 608 ± 1. 281) μmol/mg prot vs. ( 3. 628 ± 1. 064) μmol/mg prot , P = 0. 001) and Glu ( ( 4. 731 ± 0. 131) μg/mg prot vs. ( 4. 476 ± 0. 126) μg/mg prot , P = 0. 03) in the brain. Low , medium and high dose Ce O2 NPs enhanced cognitive performance of the sleep deprived mice. Among three dose groups , the medium dose groups most significantly improved the cognitive ability of mice ( ( 27 ± 2) times vs. ( 36 ± 2) times , P = 0. 005; 18. 743 % ± 0. 245 % vs. 10. 753 % ± 0. 031 % , P = 0. 0000006) , increased CAT activities ( ( 238. 065 ± 19. 393) nmol/mg prot vs. ( 78. 151 ± 17. 683) nmol/mg prot , P = 0. 00045) and T-AOC levels ( ( 210. 516 ± 11. 339) U/mg prot vs. ( 103. 630 ± 24. 209) U/mg prot , P = 0. 002) , decreased MDA ( ( 6. 528 ± 1. 162) nmol/mg prot vs. ( 9. 499 ± 1. 249) nmol/mg prot , P = 0. 039) , NO ( ( 5. 651 ± 0. 239) μmol/mg prot vs. ( 11. 608 ± 1. 281) μmol/mg prot , P = 0. 001) and Glu levels ( ( 4. 358 ± 0. 016) μg/mg prot vs. ( 4. 731 ± 0. 131) μg/mg prot , P = 0. 008). Ce O2 NPs can improve the cognitive ability of sleep deprived male mice , improve the antioxidant capacity of brain , reduce free radical damage to the nerves of brain , and regulate the neurotransmitters of brain.
