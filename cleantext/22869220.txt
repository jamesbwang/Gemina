  The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of an online , interdisciplinary , interactive course designed to increase the ability to accurately interpret the fiberoptic endoscopic exam of the swallow ( FEES) procedure to traditional , face-to-face ( F2F) lectures for both graduate medical education ( GME) and graduate speech language pathology ( GSLP) programs. This was a prospective , quantitative , nonrandomized study. Participants were medical residents in physical medicine and rehabilitation from two affiliated programs and graduate students in speech language pathology from two instructional cohorts at a single institution. Group 1 , traditional group ( n = 51) , participated in F2F lectures using an audience response system , whereas Group 2 , online group ( n = 57) , participated in an online , interactive course. The main outcome measure was pre- and post-course FEES knowledge test scores. For Group 1 , the mean pre-course score was 26.94 ( SD = 3.24) and the post-course score was 34.96 ( SD = 2.51). Differences between pre- and post-course scores for Group 1 were significant ( Incorporating technology into GME and GSLP programs yielded comparable gains to traditional lectures. Findings support the use of online education as a viable alternative to the traditional F2F classroom format for the instruction of the cognitive component of the FEES procedure.
