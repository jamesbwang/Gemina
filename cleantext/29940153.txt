  Of a series of gramicidin A ( gA) derivatives , we have earlier found the peptide ( Glu1) gA exhibiting very low toxicity toward mammalian cells , although dissipating mitochondrial membrane potential with almost the same efficiency as gA.. Substitution of glutamate for valine at position 1 of the gA amino acid sequence , which is supposed to interfere with the formation of ion-conducting gA channels via head-to-head dimerization , reduces both channel-forming potency of the peptide in planar lipid bilayer membranes<symptom> and its photonophoric activity in unilamellar liposomes. Here , we compared ( Glu1) gA and gA abilities to cause depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane in mitochondria and mitoplasts , the latter lacking the outer mitochondrial membrane. Importantly , much less gA was needed to decrease the membrane potential in mitoplasts than in mitochondria , whereas the depolarizing potency of ( Glu1) gA was nearly the same in these systems. Moreover , in multilamellar liposomes , ( Glu1) gA exhibited more pronounced protonophoric activity than gA , in contrast to the data for unilamellar liposomes. These results allowed us to conclude that ( Glu1) gA has a much higher permeability between adjacent lipid membranes<symptom> than gA.. Therefore , the fraction of peptide molecules , reaching the inner mitochondrial membrane upon the addition to cells , is much higher for ( Glu1) gA compared to g–ê. Under these conditions , the decreased cytotoxicity of ( Glu1) gA could be associated with its low efficiency as a channel-former dissipating potassium and sodium ion gradients across plasma membrane. The present study highlighted the role of the ability to permeate among various biological membranes<symptom> for intracellular efficiency of ionophores.
