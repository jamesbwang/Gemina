  This work aimed to determine if cataractous changes associated with EMT occurring in the K14E6 mice lenses are associated with TGF- Cataracts of K14E6 mice were analysed histologically; and components of TGF- The K14E6 mice , which displayed binocular cataracts in 100 % of the animals , exhibited loss of tissue organisation , cortical liquefaction , and an increase in the number of hyperproliferative-nucleated cells with mesenchymal-like characteristics in the lenses. Changes in lenses ' cell morphology were due to actin filaments reorganisation , activation of TGF- The HPV16-E6 oncoprotein induces EMT in transgenic mice cataracts. The molecular mechanism may involve TGF-
