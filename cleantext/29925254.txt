  Although cell metabolism has been established as a major regulator of eukaryotic gene expression , the mechanisms underlying this regulation are still being uncovered. Recent years have seen great advances in our understanding of biochemical mechanisms of metabolic regulation of transcription and chromatin. Prime examples include insights into how nutrients and cellular energy status regulate synthesis of ribosomal RNAs by RNA polymerases I and III during ribosome biogenesis and how a variety of enzymes that catalyze modifications of histones in chromatin are regulated by the levels of certain metabolites. This volume of the Annual Review of Biochemistry includes a set of reviews describing these and other advances in understanding aspects of the metabolic regulation of RNA polymerases I and III transcription and chromatin.
