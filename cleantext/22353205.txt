  Rejection by parents is an important aspect of child maltreatment. Altered neural responses to social rejection have been observed in maltreated individuals. The current study is the first to examine the impact of experienced and perpetrated abuse and neglect on neural responses to social exclusion by strangers versus family using a multigenerational family design , including 144 participants. The role of neural reactivity to social exclusion in the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment was also examined. Exclusion by strangers was especially associated with increased activation in the left insula , while exclusion by a family member was mainly associated with increased activation in the ACC. Neural reactivity to social exclusion by strangers in the insula , ACC and dmPFC , was associated with experienced maltreatment but not with perpetrated maltreatment. In abusive parents , altered neural reactivity during exclusion was found in other brain areas , indicating different neural correlates of experienced and perpetrated maltreatment. Hence , no mechanisms could be identified that are involved in the transmission of maltreatment. Hypersensitivity<disease> to social rejection by strangers in neglected individuals underscores the importance to distinguish between effects of abuse and neglect and suggests that the impact of experiencing rejection and maltreatment by your own parents extends beyond the family context.
