  If idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury ( IDILI) is immune mediated , then it is logical that immune modulators may be able to affect liver injury caused by a drug. We have previously shown that modulating the immune system by impairing programmed cell death protein ( PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4) signaling , both receptors involved in immune tolerance , was capable of producing an animal model of amodiaquine ( AQ) IDILI with characteristics very similar to IDILI in humans. Other immune modulators may also increase liver injury caused by drugs that cause IDILI in humans. In this study , myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs) , transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-Î²) , and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 ( LAG3) were targeted with antibodies , with and without PD-1 and CTLA-4 impairment. We found that anti-Gr1 antibodies used to deplete MDSCs led to a significant increase in AQ-induced liver injury in wild-type mice; however , the injury was actually less in PD-1
