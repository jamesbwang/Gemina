  In this study , we performed high throughput RNA sequencing at the primary bovine preadipocyte ( Day-0) , mid-differentiation ( Day-4) , and differentiated adipocyte ( Day-9) stages in order to characterize the transcriptional events regulating differentiation and function. The preadipocytes were isolated from subcutaneous fetal bovine adipose tissues and were differentiated into mature adipocytes. The adipogenic characteristics of the adipocytes were detected during various stages of adipogenesis ( Day-0 , Day-4 , and Day-9). We used RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq) to investigate a comprehensive transcriptome information of adipocytic differentiation. Compared to the pre-differentiation stage ( Day-0) , 2510 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) at the mid-differentiation stage ( Day-4). We found 2446 DEGs in the mature adipocytic stage relative to the mid-differentiation stage. Some adipogenesis-related transcription factors , CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein & alpha; ( C/EBP & alpha ;-RRB- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor & gamma; ( PPAR & gamma ;-RRB- were differentially expressed at Day-0 , Day-4 , and Day-9. We further investigated the adipogenic function of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A ( HTR2A) in adipogenesis. Overexpression of HTR2A stimulated the differentiation of preadipocytes , and knockdown of HTR2A had opposite effects. Furthermore , functional enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was the significantly enriched pathway , and HTR2A regulated adipogenesis by activating or inhibiting phosphorylation of phospho-AKT ( Ser473). In summary , the present study provides the first comparative transcription of various periods of adipocytes in cattle , which presents a solid foundation for further study into the molecular mechanism of fat deposition and the improvement of beef quality in cattle.
