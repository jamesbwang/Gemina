  To investigate the biomechanical stability of the acetabular fracture with three different internal fixation methods. Sixteen both-column acetabular fracture models were randomly divided into three groups: The specimens of 16 hip joints were randomly divided into 4 groups. Among them , 1 group of complete acetabulum were used as normal control group , and the other 3 groups simulated two column fracture models and were fixed in the following methods , respectively: anterior wall with screw and posterior with plate ( SP) , anterior wall with plate and posterior wall with screw ( PS) and both wall with plate ( PP). The degree of fracture displacement and the contact characteristics of the acetabulum were recorded by continuous vertical loading. The mean longitudinal displacement under the load 800 N of SP , PS and PP three groups were ( 1.92 ± 0.81) , ( 2.09 ± 1.13) and ( 3.44 ± 0.75) mm , there was significant difference between SP and PP group ( Anterior column screw combined with posterior column plate has better biomechanical stability and contact characteristics than other two methods.
