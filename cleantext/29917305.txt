  We report the design and characterization of a multiphase quadruple shape memory composite capable of switching between 4 programmed shapes , three temporary and one permanent. Our approach combined two previously reported fabrication methods by embedding an electrospun mat of PCL in a miscible blend of epoxy monomers and PMMA as a composite matrix. As epoxy polymerization occurred the matrix underwent phase separation between the epoxy and PMMA materials. This created a multiphase composite with PCL fibers and a two-phase matrix composed of phase-separated epoxy and PMMA. The resulting composite demonstrated three separate thermal transitions and amenability to mechanical programming of three separate temporary shapes in addition to one final , equilibrium shape. In addition , quadruple surface shape memory abilities are successfully demonstrated. The versatility of this approach offers a large degree of design flexibility for multi-shape memory materials.
