  Tunnelled pleural catheters used to treat malignant pleural effusions<symptom> may achieve pleurodesis. We aimed to identify factors associated with higher pleurodesis rates and earlier catheter removal. We retrospectively reviewed a prospective database of tunnelled pleural catheters inserted consecutively between May 2006 and June 2013 for confirmed malignant pleural effusion<symptom>. The cohort included patients who underwent medical thoracoscopy. Clinical , radiologic and pleural fluid data were recorded. We used logistic regression and Cox regression to assess rates of and days to pleurodesis , respectively. We analyzed data for 1071 tunnelled pleural catheters in 956 patients. Increased rates of pleurodesis were associated with lymphoma ( odds ratio ( OR) 3.49 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.93-6.33) , ovarian cancer ( OR 2.93 , 95 % CI 1.68-5.11) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Scale of Performance Status grade 2 or less ( OR 2.79 , 95 % CI 1.79-4.34) , medical thoracoscopy ( OR 2.21 , 95 % CI 1.28-3.85) , protein level ( OR 1.03 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.06) , albumin level ( OR 1.07 , 95 % CI 1.03-1.12) and percent eosinophils ( OR 1.04 , 95 % CI 1.00-1.07). Reduced rates of pleurodesis were associated with gastrointestinal cancers ( OR 0.41 , 95 % CI 0.19-0.87) , hydropneumothorax on the postdrainage chest radiograph ( OR 0.62 , 95 % CI 0.41-0.94) and percent other cells on cell count ( OR 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.97-0.99). Earlier pleurodesis was associated with ovarian cancer ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.48 , 95 % CI 1.06-2.08) , medical thoracoscopy ( HR 1.45 , 95 % CI 1.10-1.92) , protein level ( HR 1.03 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.04) and percent eosinophils ( HR 1.02 , 95 % CI 1.00-1.04). Delayed pleurodesis was associated with breast cancer ( HR 0.61 , 95 % CI 0.46-0.81) , hydropneumothorax with 80 % or less lung expansion ( HR 0.55 , 95 % CI 0.38-0.80) and percent other cells ( HR 0.99 , 95 % CI 0.98-1.00). Clinicians should consider numerous factors to predict the probability of and timing to pleurodesis with tunnelled pleural catheters.
