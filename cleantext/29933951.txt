  Chromosomal conformations , including promoter-enhancer loops , provide a critical regulatory layer for the transcriptional machinery. Therefore , schizophrenia , a common psychiatric disorder associated with broad changes in neuronal gene expression in prefrontal cortex and other brain regions implicated in psychosis , could be associated with alterations in higher-order chromatin. Here , we review early studies on spatial genome organization in the schizophrenia postmortem brain and discuss how integrative approaches using cell culture and animal model systems could gain deeper insight into the potential roles of higher-order chromatin for the neurobiology of and novel treatment avenues for common psychiatric disease.
