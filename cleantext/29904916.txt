  To study changes in muscular postural strategies and general motor behaviour during the transition to independent walking. Postural control was assessed at its two functional levels: ( 1) direction specificity , in which dorsal muscles are primarily activated when reaching forward; and ( 2) fine-tuning of direction specificity. In an explorative longitudinal study , surface electromyograms of the arm , trunk , and neck<symptom> muscles of 28 typically developing infants were recorded during reaching while sitting. Each infant was assessed in three developmental phases: during pull-to-stand ( T0) , first independent steps ( T1) , and 1 month after T1 ( T2). Motor behaviour was assessed using the Infant Motor Profile ( IMP). The effect on developmental outcome measures ( postural parameters and IMP) of the developmental phases ( T0 , T1 , T2) was estimated using linear mixed-effects models. None of the postural parameters changed significantly over time. However , individual developmental trajectories showed infant-specific postural reorganizational changes. Total IMP score decreased between T0 and T1 ( mean IMP score 95 % and 91 % respectively; p < 0.001); between T1 and T2 IMP scores did not change ( 91 % and 93 %; p = 0.073). Typically developing infants do not show consistent patterns of postural reorganization but show individual muscular strategies during the transition to independent walking. However , signs of reorganization of general motor behaviour are present. Infants show signs of reorganization of motor behaviour when learning to walk. Infants show individual strategies of postural reorganization when learning to walk.
