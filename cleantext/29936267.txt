  There is substantial evidence that loss of vestibular function impairs spatial learning and memory related to hippocampal ( HPC) function , as well as increasing evidence that striatal ( Str) plasticity is also implicated. Since the N-methyl-d-aspartate ( NMDA) subtype<pathogen> of glutamate receptor is considered essential to spatial memory , previous studies have investigated whether the expression of HPC NMDA receptors changes following vestibular loss; however , the results have been contradictory. Here we used a novel flow cytometric method to quantify the number of neurons expressing NMDA receptors in the HPC and Str following bilateral vestibular loss ( BVL) in rats. At 7 and 30 days post-op. , there was a significant increase in the number of HPC neurons expressing NMDA receptors in the BVL animals , compared to sham controls ( P ≤ 0.004 and P ≤ 0.0001 , respectively). By contrast , in the Str , at 7 days there was a significant reduction in the number of neurons expressing NMDA receptors in the BVL group ( P ≤ 0.05); however , this difference had disappeared by 30 days post-op. These results suggest that BVL causes differential changes in the number of neurons expressing NMDA receptors in the HPC and Str , which may be related to its long-term impairment of spatial memory.
