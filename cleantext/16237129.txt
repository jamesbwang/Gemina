  Parkinson disease ( PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies ( DLB) are Lewy body diseases characterized by abnormal alpha-synuclein deposits and overlapping pathological features in the brain. Several studies have shown that glucocerebrosidase ( GBA) deficiency is involved in the development of LB diseases. Here , we aimed to find out if this deficiency starts at the transcriptional level , also involves alternative splicing , and if GBA expression changes in brain are also detectable in blood of patients with LB diseases. The expression of three
