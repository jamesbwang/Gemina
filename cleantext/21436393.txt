  The use of rhythmic auditory stimulation ( RAS) has been proven useful in the management of gait disturbances associated with Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Typically , the RAS consists of metronome or music-based sounds<symptom> ( artificial RAS) , while ecological footstep sounds<symptom> ( ecological RAS) have never been used for rehabilitation programs. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a rehabilitation program integrated either with ecological or with artificial RAS. An observer-blind , randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the effects of 5 weeks of supervised rehabilitation integrated with RAS. Thirty-eight individuals affected by PD were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions ( ecological vs. artificial RAS); thirty-two of them ( age 68.2 Â± 10.5 , Hoehn and Yahr 1.5-3) concluded all phases of the study. Spatio-temporal parameters of gait and clinical variables were assessed before the rehabilitation period , at its end , and after a 3-month follow-up. Thirty-two participants were analyzed. The results revealed that both groups improved in the majority of biomechanical and clinical measures , independently of the type of sound<symptom>. Moreover , exploratory analyses for separate groups were conducted , revealing improvements on spatio-temporal parameters only in the ecological RAS group. Overall , our results suggest that ecological RAS is equally effective compared to artificial RAS. Future studies should further investigate the role of ecological RAS , on the basis of information revealed by our exploratory analyses. Theoretical , methodological , and practical issues concerning the implementation of ecological sounds<symptom> in the rehabilitation of PD patients are discussed. www.ClinicalTrials.gov , identifier NCT03228888.
