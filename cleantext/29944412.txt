  Treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients frequently need to be managed with clozapine. However , noncompliance is in-part due to complaints of sedation , fatigue<symptom> , and low energy. There is little literature reporting on the effectiveness and safety of using stimulants to treat clozapine-induced sedation. We report three cases of treatment-resistant schizophrenia where methylphenidate was used to address these common side-effects. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of psychostimulants in treatment-resistant schizophrenia , we reviewed 3 extensively documented cases of clozapine-induced sedation treated with methylphenidate for over 2 years , in addition to reviewing the literature on this topic. All 3 patients reported improvements in energy and fatigue<symptom> , along with decreased sedation , while treated with methylphenidate for 27 , 30 , and 32 months respectively. Clozapine doses ranged between 325 mg and 500 mg daily; methylphenidate doses ranged between 2.5 mg of the immediate-release and 72 mg daily of the extended-release formulation. There was no reported or observed increase in psychotic symptoms resulting from treatment with methylphenidate. Methylphenidate may be safe and effective in the management of clozapine-induced sedation in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Large scale , placebo-controlled , double-blind trials are needed to further validate the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate as treatment for clozapine-induced sedation.
