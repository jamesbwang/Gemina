  To investigate the influence of marginal zinc deficiency on obesity and provide the theory basis for the prevention and treatment of obesity. Thirty two male SPF SD rats were randomly divided into four groups. Four groups were supplied different doses of zinc. All rats were sacrificed after 6 weeks. Serum zinc , serum lipid , leptin , total antioxidant capacity ( T-AOC) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and malondialdehyde ( MDA) were detected. From the 5th week , the serum zinc in low zinc group was significantly lower than that in low zinc pair-control group and control group ( P < 0. 05) , and marginal zinc deficiency model was set up. At the 6th week , body fat ratio of rats in low zinc group was significantly higher than that in low zinc paircontrol group and control group ( P < 0. 05). The MDA in liver tissue of the rats in low zinc group and middle zinc group was significantly higher than that in control group ( P < 0. 05). The levels of T-AOC and SOD in the liver tissue in low zinc group and middle zinc group were significantly lower than that in control group ( P < 0. 05). The oxidative stressof the rats in low zinc group and middle zinc group increased. Marginal zinc deficiency can increase the risk of obesity. Oxidative stress significantly increase in marginal zinc-deficient rats , which may be the main reason that marginal zinc deficiency increase the risk of obesity.
