  In 2007 , a drug benefit plan for Seniors ( SDP) was launched in Saskatchewan , Canada. SDP capped out-of-pocket costs at $ 15 per prescription for individuals aged 65 and older. To quantify the impact of the SDP on chronic medication adherence. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted for participants aged 65 or older who were eligible to the SPD , controlled by a younger group aged 40 to 64 who were ineligible. Adherence was measured over 365 days using medication possession ratio ( MPR). MPRs were compared between age groups , and between pre and post SDP-launch periods. The odds ratio of optimal adherence ( i.e. , MPR â‰¥ 80 %) was estimated using logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations ( GEE). Between 2005 and 2009 , 353,568 adherence observations were observed from 188,109 unique patients. Comparing the post-SDP period vs before , the increase in the odds of optimal medication adherence was significant ( OR = 1.08 , 95 % CI: 1.04 to 1.11) and was stronger after excluding patients already receiving medication benefits from other government programs ( OR = 1.21 , 95 % CI: 1.16 to 1.26). The SDP was associated with improved adherence among the subgroup of prevalent medication users ( OR = 1.08 , 95 % CI: 1.04 to 1.12) , but not incident users ( OR = 1.05 , 95 % CI: 0.98 to 1.13). Reducing out-of-pocket medication costs for seniors was associated with small improvements in medication adherence across the population.
