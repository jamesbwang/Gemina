  Accelerometry is growing in popularity for remotely measuring fish swimming metrics , but appropriate sampling frequencies for accurately measuring these metrics are not well studied. This research examined the influence of sampling frequency ( 1-25 Hz) with tri-axial accelerometer biologgers on estimates of overall dynamic body acceleration ( ODBA) , tail-beat frequency , swimming speed and metabolic rate of bonefish Albula vulpes in a swim-tunnel respirometer and free-swimming in a wetland mesocosm. In the swim tunnel , sampling frequencies of â‰¥ 5 Hz were sufficient to establish strong relationships between ODBA , swimming speed and metabolic rate. However , in free-swimming bonefish , estimates of metabolic rate were more variable below 10 Hz. Sampling frequencies should be at least twice the maximum tail-beat frequency to estimate this metric effectively , which is generally higher than those required to estimate ODBA , swimming speed and metabolic rate. While optimal sampling frequency probably varies among species due to tail-beat frequency and swimming style , this study provides a reference point with a medium body-sized sub-carangiform teleost fish , enabling researchers to measure these metrics effectively and maximize study duration.
