  Medical education has shifted to a competency-based paradigm , leading to calls for improved learner assessment methods and validity evidence for how assessment data are interpreted. Clinical competency committees ( CCCs) use the collective input of multiple people to improve the validity and reliability of decisions made and actions taken based on assessment data. Significant heterogeneity in CCC structure and function exists across postgraduate medical education programs and specialties , and while there is no `` one-size-fits-all '' approach , there are ways to maximize value for learners and programs. This paper collates available evidence and the authors ' experiences to provide practical tips on CCC purpose , membership , processes , and outputs. These tips can benefit programs looking to start a CCC and those that are improving their current CCC processes.
