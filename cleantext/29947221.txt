  The need for point-of-care devices able to detect diseases early and monitor their status , out of a lab environment , has stimulated the development of compact biosensing configurations. Whereas localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR) sensing integrated into a state-of-the-art microfluidic chip stands as a promising approach to meet this demand , its implementation into an operating sensing platform capable of quantitatively detecting a set of molecular biomarkers in an unknown biological sample is only in its infancy. Here , we present an on-chip LSPR sensor capable of performing automatic , quantitative , and multiplexed screening of biomarkers. We demonstrate its versatility by programming it to detect and quantify in human serum four relevant human serum protein markers associated with breast cancer.
