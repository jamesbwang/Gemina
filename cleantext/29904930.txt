  To estimate the prevalence of self-reported gingival bleeding in a representative sample of 12- to 17-year-old Brazilian adolescents. Sociodemographic and oral health information were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire of the Study of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adolescents. The adolescents answered `` yes '' or `` no '' to the question `` Do your gums<symptom> bleed? '' 74,589 of the 102,327 eligible adolescents answered the questionnaire and 18.4 % ( 95 % CI 17.5-19.3) reported having bleeding gums<symptom>. The prevalence of self-reported gingival bleeding varied as following: 21.4 % ( 95 % CI 20.3-22.6) in girls and 15.3 % ( 95 % CI 14.3-16.4) in boys; 20.5 % ( 95 % CI 19.2-21.8) in older and 17.5 % ( 95 % CI 16.4-18.6) in younger adolescents; 20.6 % ( 95 % CI 18.5-22.9) in Black people and 17.1 % ( 95 % CI 16.1-18.1) in White people. Regarding mother 's level of education , the prevalences were 18.1 % ( 95 % CI 16.2-20.3) , 17.6 % ( 95 % CI 16.4-18.9) and 19.3 % ( 95 % CI 17.9-20.9) for high , middle and low levels , respectively. For socioeconomic status , the equivalent figures were 16.4 % ( 95 % CI 14.3-18.7) , 18.4 % ( 95 % CI 17.5-19.4) and 23.0 % ( 95 % CI 17.3-29.9). Nearly one in five Brazilian adolescents reported having gingival bleeding , which might not be a serious condition , but reflect the disease and the adolescents ' perception of oral health status.
