  Developmental processes in different mammals are thought to share fundamental cellular mechanisms. We report a dramatic increase in cell size during postnatal pancreas development in rodents , accounting for much of the increase in organ size after birth. Hypertrophy of pancreatic acinar cells involves both higher ploidy and increased biosynthesis per genome copy; is maximal adjacent to islets , suggesting endocrine to exocrine communication; and is partly driven by weaning-related processes. In contrast to the situation in rodents , pancreas cell size in humans remains stable postnatally , indicating organ growth by pure hyperplasia<disease>. Pancreatic acinar cell volume varies 9-fold among 24 mammalian species analyzed , and shows a striking inverse correlation with organismal lifespan. We hypothesize that cellular hypertrophy is a strategy for rapid postnatal tissue growth , entailing life-long detrimental effects.
