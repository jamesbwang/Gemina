  There remain 21 systems ( out of over 3500 possible combinations of the elements) in which the existence of the simple binary equiatomic phases AB has not been established experimentally. Among these , the presumed binary phase HfIn is predicted to adopt the tetragonal CuAu-type structure ( space group P4/ mmm) by a recently developed machine-learning model and by structure optimization through global energy minimization. To test this prediction , the Hf-In system was investigated experimentally by reacting the elements in a 1:1 stoichiometry at 1070 K. Under the conditions investigated , the bulk and surface of the sample correspond to different crystalline phases but have nearly the same equiatomic composition , as revealed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The structure of the bulk sample , which was solved from powder X-ray diffraction data through simulated annealing , corresponds to the Î³-brass ( Cu
