  Previous studies showed that glyphosate stimulates breast cancer cell growth via estrogen receptors. The present study investigated the effect of glyphosate on the estrogen signaling pathway involved in the induction of cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA) cell growth. HuCCA-1 , RMCCA-1 and MMNK-1 were chosen for comparison. The effects of glyphosate on cell growth , cell cycle and molecular signaling pathways were measured. The results showed that HuCCA-1 cells expressed estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα) , while ERα was not detected in RMCCA-1 and MMNK-1 cells. ERα was mostly expressed in cytoplasmic compartment of HuCCA-1 cells. Estradiol ( E2) ( 10
