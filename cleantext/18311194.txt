  Alcohol use disorder ( AUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive alcohol use , loss of control over alcohol intake , and a negative emotional state when not using ( 1). Abusive alcohol consumption directly affects a person 's physical and psychological health and social life. The World Health Organization has shown that Lithuania is a leading country in pure alcohol consumption in the world ( 2). The aim of this study is to find novel genome variants that are associated with the AUD in the Lithuanian cohort. A case-control study included 294 individuals of Lithuanian ethnicity , who were divided into two groups based on their habits of alcohol use. Single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis was performed using Illumina HiScanSQ â„¢ genome analyzer. Our study showed that rs686141T > C variant in We analyzed 23 genes associated with AUD and identified two novel genome variants ( rs686141T > C and rs6354C > A). The study shows that genome analysis is an important tool for AUD research. The results supplement the known information about genes associated with AUD.
