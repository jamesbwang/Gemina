  Although high serum cholesterol in young adults is known to be a predictor for cardiovascular events , there is not enough evidence for the association of cholesterol level change with cardiovascular disease ( CVD). This study aimed to evaluate whether the change in cholesterol is associated with incidence of CVD among young adults. We examined 2 682 045 young adults ( aged 20-39 years) who had undergone 2 consecutive national health check-ups provided by Korean National Health Insurance Service between 2002 and 2005. Cholesterol levels were classified into low ( < 180 mg/dL) , middle ( 180-240 mg/dL) and high ( ≥ 240 mg/dL). CVD events were defined as ≥ 2 days hospitalization attributable to CVD for 10 years follow-up. Increased cholesterol levels were significantly associated with elevated ischemic heart disease risk ( adjusted hazard ration ( aHR) = 1.21; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.03-1.42 in low-high group and aHR = 1.21; 95 % CI = 1.15-1.27 in middle-high group) and cerebrovascular disease ( CEVD) risk ( aHR = 1.24; 95 % CI = 1.05-1.47 in low-high group and aHR = 1.09; 95 % CI = 1.02-1.16 in middle-high group). Decreased cholesterol levels were associated with reduced ischemic heart disease risk ( aHR = 0.91; 95 % CI = 0.88-0.95 in middle-low group , aHR = 0.65; 95 % CI = 0.56-0.75 in high-low group and aHR = 0.68; 95 % CI = 0.65-0.73 in high-middle group). Furthermore , lower cerebrovascular disease risk ( aHR = 0.76; 95 % CI = 0.62-0.92) was observed in the high-low group compared with patients with sustained high cholesterol. The findings of our study indicate that increased cholesterol levels were associated with high CVD risk in young adults. Furthermore , young adults with decreased cholesterol levels had reduced risk for CVD.
