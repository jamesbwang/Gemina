  Diosgenin , a precursor of steroid hormones in plants , is known to exhibit diverse pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory properties. In this study , ( 3β , 25R) spirost‑5‑en‑3‑oxyl ( 2 ( ( 2 ( ( 2‑aminoethyl) amino) ethyl) amino) ethyl) carbamate ( DGP) , a new synthetic diosgenin derivative incorporating primary amine was used to investigate its anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of action in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- stimulated microglial BV2 cells. Pretreatment with DGP resulted in significant inhibition of nitric oxide ( NO) synthesis , and down-regulation of nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. In addition , DGP decreased the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin ( IL) -6 , IL-1β , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF-α). The inhibitory effects of DGP on these inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells were regulated by NF-κB signaling through blocking p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB p65/DNA binding activity. DGP also blocked the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase ( JNK) , but not p38 kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERK). The NF-κB inhibitor JSH-23 and JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 significantly decreased NO production and IL-6 release in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells , respectively. The overall results demonstrate that DGP has anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated BV2 cells via inhibition of NF-κB and JNK activation , suggesting that DGP is a potential prophylactic agent in various neurodegenerative disorders.
