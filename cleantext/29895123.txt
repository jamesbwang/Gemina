  The last 25 years have brought significant progress in the treatment of sarcomas<disease> in children , especially rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS). Nevertheless , treatment failure in some patients results from considerable biological heterogeneity noted in these tumours. RMS , the most common malignant soft tissue neoplasm in children , includes two main subtypes: embryonal ( ERMS) and alveolar ( ARMS). Due to greater aggressiveness and worse prognosis of ARMS in comparison to ERMS , discrimination between different rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes is of crucial clinical importance. This paper presents the current histological classification of RMS , up-to-date immunohistochemical and biological research regarding RMS , and its associated clinical and prognostic significance.
