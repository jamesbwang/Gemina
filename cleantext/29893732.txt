  Electrochemical oxidation of an emerging pollutant , 2- ( 4-methylphenoxy) ethanol ( MPET) , from water has been studied by cyclic voltammetry ( CV). Multiwall carbon nanotubes glassy carbon electrodes ( MWCNT-GCE) were used as working electrode due to their extraordinary properties. The oxidation process is irreversible , since no reduction peaks were observed in the reverse scan. The electrocatalytic effect of MWCNT was confirmed as the oxidation peak intensity increases in comparison to bare-GCE. The effect of functional groups on MWCNT was also studied by MWCNT functionalized with NH
