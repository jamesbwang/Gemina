  Two new naphthalenic lactone glycosides , ( 3S) -9,10-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-3,4-dihydro-1H-benzo ( g) isochromene-3-carboxylic acid 9-O-β-D-glucopyranoside ( 1) and ( 3R)- cassialactone 9-O-β-D-glucopyranoside ( 2) were isolated from seeds of Cassia obtusifolia Linn. , along with five known compounds: ( 3R)- cassialactone 9-O-β-D-gentiobioside ( 3) , emodin 1-O-β-gentiobioside ( 4) , 1-hydroxyl-2-acetyl-3,8-dimethoxy-naphthalene 6-O-β-D-apiofuranosyl- ( 1 → 2)- β-D-glucopyranoside ( 5) , rubrofusarin 6-O-β-D-gentiobioside ( 6) , rubrofusarin 6-O-β-D-triglucoside ( 7). Structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated by NMR and HR-ESI-MS spectroscopic analysis. Their stereochemistry was determined by CD experiment. All compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the formation of advanced glycation end-products in vitro. Compounds 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 showed significant in vitro inhibitory activities ( IC
