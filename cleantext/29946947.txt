  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome<disease> ( OSAS) has been recently proposed as an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Cystatin C ( Cyst<disease> C) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL) are novel biomarkers for the earlier detection of latent kidney disease. The aim of the study was to assess serum Cyst<disease> C and NGAL levels in otherwise healthy OSAS patients and to explore possible associations with sleep parameters. Consecutive subjects ( n = 96 , 79.2 % males) , without known comorbidities , with symptoms suggestive of OSAS were included. All of them underwent polysomnography ( PSG) and blood examination for the measurement of serum Cyst<disease> C and NGAL levels. Based on apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI) , subjects were classified into two groups: 32 controls and 64 OSAS patients , with no significant differences in terms of age ( 50.1 ± 11.7 vs 51 ± 12.2 years , p = 0.747) and BMI ( 33.9 ± 8.8 vs 35.9 ± 13.1 kg/m Higher risk for latent kidney disease in otherwise healthy OSAS patients is indicated. Sleep hypoxia seems to be a significant contributor in the pathogenetic process of renal dysfunction in OSAS.
