  The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the quality of evidence of studies assessing isokinetic hip muscle strength in adult non-injured individuals. We also aimed to summarise and pool data of normative values for hip muscle strength. The influence of methodological and participant-related factors on hip strength performance was explored as well. Guidelines proposed in the PRISMA were used to undertake a search strategy involving the keyword ` hip ' associated with a set of keywords reflecting muscle strength. Five databases were searched: ProQuest , PubMed , Science Direct , Scopus and Web of Science. From the 2,939 records initially retained , 28 articles were included in this systematic review. Eight articles were classified as high quality. This systematic review exposed the methodological fragility of most studies assessing hip strength in non-injured adult population. Only data from studies with a small number of participants are available to be used as reference. A few individual studies suggest no differences in torque parameters between dominant and non-dominant lower limbs; differences in torque parameters between age groups; and between male and female participants. Overall , reference values for hip muscle performance in isokinetic tests are mostly unclear.
