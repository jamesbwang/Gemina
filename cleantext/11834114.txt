  The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of equal-volume resistance training ( RT) performed with different training frequencies on muscle size and strength in trained young men. Sixteen men with at least one year of RT experience were divided into two groups , G1 and G2 , that trained each muscle group once and twice a week , respectively , for 10 weeks. Elbow flexor muscle thickness ( MT) was measured using a B-Mode ultrasound and concentric peak torque of elbow extensors and flexors<symptom> were assessed by an isokinetic dynamometer. ANOVA did not reveal group by time interactions for any variable , indicating no difference between groups for the changes in MT or PT of elbow flexors<symptom> and extensors. Notwithstanding , MT of elbow flexors<symptom> increased significantly ( 3.1 % , The present study suggest that there were no differences in the results promoted by equal-volume resistance training performed once or twice a week on upper body<symptom> muscle strength in trained men. Only the group performing one session per week significantly increased the MT of their elbow flexors<symptom>. However , with either once or twice a week training , adaptations appear largely minimal in previously trained males.
