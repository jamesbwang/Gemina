  How to coordinate the contradiction between lubrication and heat transfer in the peritectic steel casting process is the key technical difficulty in preparing mold fluxes. The mold fluxes that are required for casting are subjected to the shear stress generated by mold oscillation and slab movement , which affects the crystallization performance of slags. The quantitative effect of slags & rsquo; crystallization performance by shear stress is studied to develop a low-basicity and high-crystallization mold flux to solve the above problem. The results show that the crystallization kinetic condition is promoted , and the crystallization activation energy is reduced by the shear stress , which leads to an increase in the crystallization temperature. Concurrently , the crystal size is reduced. However , the shear stress has no effect on the crystalline phase. The influence of different shear stresses on the crystallization ability of molten slags is related to the crystal nucleation and growth mechanisms.
