  Recent literature suggests that catalytic doses ( & le; 10 g/meal or 36 g/day) of D-fructose and D-allulose may reduce postprandial blood glucose responses to carbohydrate loads in people with and without type 2 diabetes by inducing glycogen synthesis. To assess the effect of small single doses of fructose and allulose on postprandial blood glucose regulation in response to a 75 g-oral glucose tolerance test ( 75 g-OGTT) in healthy individuals , we conducted an acute randomized , crossover , equivalence trial in healthy adults. Each participant randomly received six treatments , separated by a minimum one-week washout. Treatments consisted of a 75 g-OGTT with the addition of fructose or allulose at 0 g ( control) , 5 g or 10 g. A standard 75 g-OGTT protocol was followed with blood samples at & minus; 30 , 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 min. The primary outcome was the difference in plasma glucose incremental area under the curve ( iAUC). A total of 27 participants underwent randomization with data available from 25 participants. Small doses of fructose or allulose did not show a significant effect on plasma glucose iAUC or other secondary markers of postprandial blood glucose regulation in response to a 75 g-OGTT in healthy individuals. These results were limited by the low power to detect a significant difference , owing to greater than expected intra-individual coefficient of variation ( CV) in plasma glucose iAUC. Overall , we failed to confirm the catalytic effects of small doses of fructose and allulose in healthy individuals. Future trials may consider recruiting larger sample sizes of healthy individuals. clinicaltrials.gov identifier , NCT02459834.
