  To explore the prognostic related factors and mechanisms of gastric cancer ( GC) , we performed the systematic analysis with integrated bioinformatics tools based on multiple on-line datasets. With uni-variate COX analysis , we screened out 37 survival hazardous genes in GC. Further GO assays disclosed that the signatures related with extracellular matrix and structure , and the functions of `` cell adhesion molecule binding '' and `` integrin binding '' were the vital mechanisms of disease progression , and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 ( TIMP2) was the potential biomarker for prognosis. Based on GSEA , GSVA and GCN , TIMP2 was demonstrated to interact with multiple integrin pathways and involve in the regulation of EMT , cell adhesion , and angiogenesis of GC. The associations of TIMP2 expression with reduced OS and RFS of patients were declared by Kaplan-Meier analysis , and further confirmed by 1000 internal bootstrap replications and external KM plotter analysis. With multi-variate COX regression and time-dependent ROC analysis , we validated the prediction independency and capacity of TIMP2 for prognosis. The relationships of TIMP2 with clinicopathological characteristics were also uncovered. Taken together , our findings identify TIMP2 as the novel candidate biomarker for poorer outcome of GC patients , and revealed the underlying functions of TIMP2 and the potential mechanisms for GC progression.
