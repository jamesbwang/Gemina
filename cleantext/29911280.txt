  The claustrum is a thin grey matter structure which is involved in a wide brain network. Previous studies suggested a link between claustrum and Parkinson 's Disease ( PD) , showing how α-synuclein pathology may affect claustral neurons as well as how α-synuclein immunoreactivity may correlate with the onset of cognitive dysfunctions. Our aim is to investigate , via diffusion MRI , claustral structural network changes in drug naïve PD patients , with the goal to understand whether such changes may contribute to cognitive decline in PD. 15 drug naïve PD patients and 15 age-matched controls were enrolled; MR protocol was performed on a 3T scanner. Whole brain probabilistic tractography was obtained using Constrained Spherical Deconvolution ( CSD) diffusion model. Connectivity matrices were estimated based on a robust anatomical parcellation of structural T1w images. In PD group , impaired subnetworks were correlated with psychological examinations. We found decreased claustral connectivity in PD patients compared to controls , especially with areas mainly involved in visuomotor and attentional systems. Moreover , we found a positive correlation between MoCA and density of pathways connecting ipsilaterally claustrum to left ( r = 0.578 , p = 0.021) and right ( r = 0.640 , p = 0.020) Pars Orbitalis. Our results support the hypothesis of claustral involvement in cognitive decline in drug naïve PD patients.
