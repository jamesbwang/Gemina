  Preadipocyte migration is a fundamental and important process for the development of tissue organization , especially in the development of primitive adipose tissue and adipocyte tissue wound<disease> healing. However , excessive migration may result in abnormal development and fibrosis-related diseases such as hypertrophic scar. We previously reported that type I collagen ( collagen I) enhanced migration of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes via phosphorylation and/or acetylation of NF-κB p65 , and the enhanced cell migration is repressed by silibinin treatment through sirt1. It is known that sirt1 has an ability to deacetylate acetylated NF-κB p65 , but little is known about the effect of sirt1 on phosphorylated NF-κB p65. This study aims to examine the potential effect of sirt1 on the regulation of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 and the underlying mechanism. Autophagy is involved in many physiological and pathological processes , including regulation of cell migration as well as in cellular homeostasis. The present study demonstrates that silibinin induces autophagy in a dose-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 cells. Autophagy is under the regulation of sirt1/AMPK pathway , and inhibits collagen I-enhanced migration of 3T3-L1 cells through negative regulation of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation but not acetylation. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α ( PPARα) is up-regulated with silibinin accompanying up-regulation of autophagy through activating sirt1 in 3T3-L1 cells. Taken together , these findings indicate that silibinin-induced autophagy is mediated by up-regulation of PPARα-sirt1-AMPK , contributing to repression of type I collagen-enhanced migration in murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes through down-regulation of phosphorylated NF-κB p65.
