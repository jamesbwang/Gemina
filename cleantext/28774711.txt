  Metabolomics , the study of small molecules involved in cellular processes , offers the potential to reveal insights into the pathophysiology of disease states. Analysis of metabolites by electrospray mass spectrometry is complicated by their structural diversity. Amine , hydroxyl , and carboxylate groups all affect signal responses differently based on their polarity and proton affinity. This heterogeneity of signal response , sensitivity , and resistance to competing ionization complicates metabolite quantitation. Such limitations can be mitigated by a dual derivatization scheme. In this work , primary amine and hydroxyl groups are tagged with a linear acyl chloride head containing a tertiary amine tail , followed by carboxylate groups coupled to a linear amine tag with a tertiary amine tail. This tagging scheme increases analyte proton affinity and hydrophobicity. In the case of carboxylate groups , the inherent anionic charge is inverted to a cationic charge. This dual tagging is completed within 2.5 hours , diminishes adduct formation , and improves sensitivity by > 75-fold. The average limit of detection for 23 metabolites was 38 nM and the R
