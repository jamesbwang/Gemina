  To overcome shortcomings of hydraulic calcium-silicate cements ( hCSCs) , an experimental tricalcium silicate ( TCS) cement , named ` TCS 50 ' , was developed. In vitro research showed that TCS 50 played no negative effect on the viability and proliferation of human dental pulp cells , and it induced cell odontogenic differentiation. The objective was to evaluate the pulpal repair potential of TCS 50 applied onto exposed minipig pulps. Twenty permanent teeth from three minipigs were mechanically exposed and capped using TCS 50; half of the teeth were scheduled for 7-day and the other half for 70-day examination ( n = 10). Commercial hCSCs ProRoot MTA and TheraCal LC were tested as references ( n = 8). Tooth discoloration was examined visually. After animal sacrifice , the teeth were scanned using micro-computed tomography; inflammatory response at day 7 and day 70 , mineralized tissue formation at day 70 were assessed histologically. Up to 70 days , TCS 50 induced no discoloration , ProRoot MTA generated gray/black discoloration in all teeth. For TCS 50 , 40.0 % pulps exhibited a mild/moderate inflammation<symptom> at day 7. No inflammation<symptom> was detected and complete reparative dentin with tubular structures was formed in all pulps after 70 days. ProRoot MTA induced a similar response , TheraCal LC generated a less favorable response in terms of initial inflammation<symptom> and reparative dentin formation; however , these differences were not significant ( Chi-square test of independence: p > 0.05). TCS 50 induced reparative dentinogenesis in minipig pulps. It can be considered as a promising pulp-capping agent , also for aesthetic areas.
