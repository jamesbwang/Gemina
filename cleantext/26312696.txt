  Cutaneous metastasis is the main cause of morbidity and mortality of cancer patients , denoting a guarded prognosis. The clinical spectrum of the disease is broad and can mimic benign conditions. The diagnosis depends on thorough clinical examination and complementary exams , with emphasis on the histopathological study and immunohistochemistry. Because it indicates a systemic relapse , it is necessary to intervene with intravenous chemotherapy , to which local therapies can be associated. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman with cutaneous metastasis from breast cancer treated 14 years back , manifested by extensive firm and infiltrated red-purple plaques on the sides of the trunk , with a course of six months. After evaluation , she was referred to the regional cancer center. She passed away one month and a half later.
