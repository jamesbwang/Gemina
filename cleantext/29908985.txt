  Quantum dots ( QDs) conjugated with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD) peptides ( which are integrin antagonists) are novel nanomaterials with the unique optical property of high molar extinction coefficient , and they have potential utility as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy ( PDT). Our group previously demonstrated significant benefits of using PDT with QD-RGD on pancreatic tumor cells. This study aimed to evaluate the biodistribution and toxicity of QD-RGD in mice prior to in vivo application. Mice with pancreatic neoplasms were intratumorally injected with varying doses of QD-RGD , and the biodistribution 0-24 h post injection was compared to that in control mice ( intravenously injected with unconjugated QD). Various tissue samples were collected for toxicity analyses , which included inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS) to assess Cd
