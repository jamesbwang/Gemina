  To present the indications , technical aspects , and initial results of the first cases using Endo-Model ™ implants in Brazil. A prospective study was conducted. It included nine patients submitted to a total knee arthroplasty , of which six were primary and three were revisions , using exclusively the Endo-Model ™ implant. These patients were followed for an average of 12 months and evaluated with functional scores , such as the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS) , Knee Society Score ( KSS) , and visual analog pain scale ( VAS). There were statistically significant improvements in all scores evaluated in every patient. Only one complication occurred postoperatively ( apraxia of the peroneal nerve) and did not require surgery revision. The use of a rotating-hinge implant for knee arthroplasty is a new option for complex cases with severe instability in Brazil; the initial results are satisfactory.
