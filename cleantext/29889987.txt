  In infants with acute bronchiolitis<disease> , the precision of parental disease severity assessment is unclear. We aimed to determine if parental assessment at the time of hospitalisation predicted the use of supportive care , and subsequently determine the likelihood that the infant with acute bronchiolitis<disease> would receive supportive care. From the Bronchiolitis<disease> ALL south-east Norway study , we included all 267 , 0-12 month old , infants with acute bronchiolitis<disease> whose parents at the time of hospitalisation completed a three-item visual analogue scale ( VAS) concerning Activity , Feeding and Illness. Respiratory rate , oxygen saturation ( SpO The parental Activity , Feeding and Illness VAS scores significantly predicted supportive care with odds ratios of 1.23 , 1.26 and 1.36 , respectively. The prediction algorithm included parental Feeding and Illness scores , SpO Parental assessment at hospital admission moderately predicted supportive care treatment in infants with acute
