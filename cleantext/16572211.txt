  A comparative examination is presented of materials and approaches for the fabrication of microfluidic devices for small-angle neutron scattering ( SANS). Representative inorganic glasses , metals , and polymer materials and devices are evaluated under typical SANS configurations. Performance criteria include neutron absorption , scattering background and activation , as well as spatial resolution , chemical compatibility and pressure resistance , and also cost , durability and manufacturability. Closed-face polymer photolithography between boron-free glass ( or quartz) plates emerges as an attractive approach for rapidly prototyped microfluidic SANS devices , with transmissions up to âˆ¼ 98 % and background similar to a standard liquid cell (
