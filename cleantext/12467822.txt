  An association between atrial myxoma and left ventricular failure is rarely described , is not completely understood , and may have multiple etiologies. We present a 49-year-old man with no history of cardiovascular disease who was admitted to our hospital with pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom>. He was in atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> with rapid ventricular response. Echocardiography showed a 10.5-cm left atrial myxoma , which had been asymptomatic until the onset of congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in the presence of severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Left ventricular inflow obstruction associated with the giant atrial mass could not be the only cause for
