  The natural flavonoid quercetin has antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and anticancer effects. We investigated the effect of quercetin on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced macrophage migration. Quercetin significantly attenuated LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS)- derived nitric oxide ( NO) production in RAW264 .7 cells without affecting their viability. Additionally , quercetin altered the cell size and induced an elongated morphology and enlarged the vacuoles and concentrated nuclei. Quercetin significantly disrupted the F-actin cytoskeleton structure. Furthermore , quercetin strongly inhibited LPS-induced macrophage adhesion and migration in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover , quercetin inhibited the LPS-induced expression of p-FAK , p-paxillin , FAK , and paxillin as well as the cytoskeletal adapter proteins vinculin and Tensin-2. Therefore , quercetin suppresses LPS-induced migration by inhibiting NO production , disrupting the F-actin cytoskeleton , and suppressing the FAK-paxillin pathway. Quercetin may thus have potential as a therapeutic agent for
