  To prospectively evaluate short- to medium-term patient-reported lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS) and their effect on health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) using validated questionnaires in a large cohort of patients following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy ( RARP) for prostate cancer. HRQoL and LUTS outcomes were prospectively assessed in 357 consecutive men undergoing RARP at a single center from 2012 to 2015 using the functional assessment of cancer therapy-prostate ( FACT-P) and the international consultation on incontinence modular questionnaire-male LUTS ( ICIQ-MLUTS). Questionnaires were administered at baseline , 6 , 12 , and 18 months. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests and ANOVA. Questionnaire completion rates were high ( over 60 % of eligible men completed 18-month follow-up). Mean Total FACT-P did not significantly change after RARP: 125.95 ( standard deviation ( SD) = 19.82) at baseline and 125.86 ( SD = 21.14) at 18-months ( P = 0.55). Mean total ICIQ-MLUTS also remained unchanged: 18.69 ( SD = 10.70) at baseline and 18.76 ( SD = 11.33) at 18-months ( P = 0.11). Mean voiding score significantly reduced from 10.34 ( SD = 5.78) at baseline to 6.33 ( SD = 3.99) at 6 months after RARP ( P < 0.001). A reciprocal significant increase in storage score was observed: 5.34 ( SD = 4.26) at baseline , 9.65 ( SD = 5.71) at 6 months ( P < 0.001). Subanalyses of ICIQ-MLUTS scores revealed increases in storage symptoms were exclusively within urinary incontinence domains and included significant increases in both urge and stress urinary incontinence scores. Overall , patient-reported outcome measures evaluating HRQoL and LUTS do not significantly change after RARP. Detailed analysis reveals significant changes within LUTS domains do occur after surgery which could be overlooked if only total LUTS scores are reported.
