  To evaluate the outcomes of tracheobronchial stenting in patients with malignant central airway obstruction and assist practitioners in palliative settings in understanding the indications , contraindications and management of tracheobronchial stents. This retrospective study involved a consecutive case series of palliative patients with central airway obstruction secondary to inoperable cancers who underwent tracheobronchial stenting at a single institution. The European Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG) scale was used to evaluate patient functional status before and after tracheobronchial stenting. Twenty-three patients underwent tracheobronchial stenting for malignant central airway obstruction. The majority of patients presented with symptoms of worsening dyspnoea ( 21 of 23; 91 %). Postoperatively , there was a significant improvement in mean ECOG performance status from 2.88 ± 0.34 to 1.58 ± 0.50 ( p < 0.01). There was no intraoperative mortality resulting from tracheobronchial stenting. Five patients ( 21.74 %) re-presented to hospital due to worsening symptoms and required emergency bronchoscopy. Two patients had stent migration , requiring stent replacement. One patient restenosed from tumour granulation , requiring microdebrider to debulk the mass. Two patients had stent failure secondary to external tumour compression , leading to death. Tracheobronchial stenting is a safe and effective procedure that offers rapid palliation of symptoms and improvement in patient functional status.
