  As a platform chemical , acetoin has a great potential of application in medicine and food industries. In order to improve the efficiency of acetoin production , Bacillus<pathogen> amyloliquefaciens was treated by atmospheric and room temperature plasma and gamma rays. Two-round screening was adopted for obtaining positive mutants , and the best mutant B. amyloliquefaciens H-5 produced acetoin up to 68.2 g/L in shake flask. Then , culture conditions were optimized in 5-L fermentor to enhance acetoin production. Finally , 85.2 g/L acetoin was produced by B. amyloliquefaciens H-5 , which was increased by 26.8 % compared with that of the original strain B. amyloliquefaciens FMME088. These results indicated that the high-producing strain can be obtained efficiently by compound mutagenesis , which has a promising prospect for commercial scale process.
