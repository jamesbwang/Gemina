  Contemporary reimbursement systems allow hospitals to maintain profitability by offering procedural services. However , increasing procedural volume can be met with structural inefficiencies that in turn cause delays , worse patient outcomes , and increased cost. A multidisciplinary team assessed operations and outcomes at the Heart and Vascular Center at Yale New Haven Hospital , a tertiary academic medical center. Data were analyzed retrospectively to assess delays in transferring patients between care environments , patient outcomes , and cost. An intervention was implemented over 90 days , with follow up analysis. Interventions were based off principles of Dynamic Work Design ( DWD)- an emerging management science framework promoting human-centered work design. Before intervention , delay in patient transfer from operating rooms ( OR) to the intensive care unit ( ICU) was associated with statistically significantly longer ICU length of stay ( 13 % increase) and higher blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 16 % increase). 30-day readmission and 30-day mortality rates were also both increased ( 10 % and 34 %). Delays imposed an additional cost of $ 3,509,621. A tipping point of weekly surgical volume was identified above which delays occurred. After implementing operational changes , 16 % fewer patients were delayed , and ICU LOS decreased by 19 %. There was no significant change in surgical volume , 30-day mortality , 30-day readmission , and readmission to the OR or ICU. However , costs decreased by 19 %. Operational assessment and DWD can be used to help staff manage increasing case volume by improving efficiency while maintaining quality of care at reduced cost to the system.
