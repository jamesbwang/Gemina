  The pentacoordinated , 16-valence electron ( VE) Mo imido alkylidene N-heterocyclic carbene ( NHC) complexes I1-I5 and the hexacoordinated 18-VE Mo imido alkylidene NHC complexes 1-4 , 8 , 10 and 12 containing a chelating ligand have been prepared and used as thermally latent catalysts in the ring-opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP) of dicyclopentadiene ( DCPD). Both 10 and 12 are the first Mo imido alkylidene complexes with a chelating alkylidene featuring a carboxylate group. Complexes I1-I3 and I5 as well as 1-4 proved to be fully thermally latent in the presence of DCPD. With the changes in both the electronic and steric situation at the imido ligand provided by these pre-catalysts , different temperatures of the onset of polymerization ( T
