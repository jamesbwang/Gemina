  Human adipose mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ( Ad-MSCs) have been proposed as a suitable option for bone tissue engineering. However , donor age , weight , and gender might affect the outcome. There is still a lack of knowledge of the effects the donor tissue site might have on Ad-MSCs function. Thus , this study investigated proliferation , stem cell , and osteogenic differentiation capacity of human Ad-MSCs obtained from subcutaneous fat tissue acquired from different locations ( abdomen , hip , thigh , knee , and limb). Ad-MSCs from limb and knee showed strong proliferation despite the presence of osteogenic stimuli , resulting in limited osteogenic characteristics. The less proliferative Ad-MSCs from hip and thigh showed the highest alkaline phosphatase ( AP) activity and matrix mineralization. Ad-MSCs from the abdomen showed good proliferation and osteogenic characteristics. Interestingly , the observed differences were not dependent on donor age , weight , or gender , but correlated with the expression of
