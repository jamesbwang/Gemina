  Phosphoinositides are bioactive lipids essential in the regulation of cell signaling as well as cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics. Their metabolism is highly active in blood platelets where they play a critical role during activation , at least through two well identified pathways involving phospholipase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinases ( PI3K). Here , using a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method recently developed , we monitored for the first time the profiling of phosphatidylinositol ( PI) , PIP , PIP
