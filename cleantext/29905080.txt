  HIV<pathogen> type 1 ( HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins ( Env) mediate virus entry and are the target of neutralizing antibodies. Binding of the metastable HIV-1 Env trimer to the CD4 receptor triggers structural rearrangements that mediate Env conformational transitions from a closed conformation to a more open state through an intermediate step. Recent studies have revealed new insights on the dynamics , regulation , and molecular mechanisms of Env transitions along the entry pathway. In this study , we provide an overview of the current knowledge on Env conformational dynamics and the relationship between Env conformational states and neutralization selectivity of the broadly neutralizing antibodies that develop in 10 % -20 % of infected individuals and may provide guidance for the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine.
