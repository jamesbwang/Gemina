  The non-ribosomal peptide gliotoxin , which autoinduces its own biosynthesis , has potent anti-fungal activity , especially in the combined absence of the gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT and bis-thiomethyltransferase GtmA. Dithiol gliotoxin ( DTG) is a substrate for both of these enzymes. Herein we demonstrate that DTG chelates Zn2 + ( m/z 424.94) , rapidly chelates Zn2 + from Zn ( 4- ( 2-pyridylazo)- resorcinol) ( Zn ( PAR) 2) and also inhibits a Zn2 +- dependent alkaline phosphatase ( AP). Zn2 + addition rescues AP function following DTG-associated inhibition , and pre-incubation of DTG with Zn2 + completely protects AP activity. Zn2 + ( 1-50 μM) also significantly relieves the potent gliotoxin-mediated inhibition of Aspergillus<pathogen> fumigatus<pathogen> ΔgliT:: ΔgtmA ( p < 0.05) , which infers in vivo dithiol gliotoxin-mediated sequestration of free Zn2 + or chelation from intracellular metalloenzymes as inhibitory mechanisms. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that excess Zn2 + alters the effect of gliotoxin on A.<pathogen> fumigatus<pathogen> ΔgliT , with differential abundance of secondary metabolism-associated proteins in the combinatorial condition. GtmA abundance increased 18.8 fold upon co-addition of gliotoxin and Zn2 + compared to gliotoxin alone , possibly to compensate for disruption to GtmA activity , as seen in in vitro assays. Furthermore , DTG effected significant in vitro aggregation of a number of protein classes , including Zn2 +- dependent enzymes , while proteins were protected from aggregation by pre-incubating DTG with Zn2 +. We conclude that DTG can act in vivo as a Zn2 + chelator , which can significantly impede A.<pathogen> fumigatus<pathogen> growth in the absence of GliT and GtmA.
