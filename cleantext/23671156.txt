  Chronic refractory angina pectoris ( AP) affects 600,000 to 1,800,000 Americans , with approximately 50,000 new cases annually. A recent study revealed long-term mortality of refractory AP to be lower than previously reported , with > 70 % of patients living > 9 years. Treating AP can improve quality of life. We describe a patient with refractory AP who underwent a successful stellate ganglion block for symptom control.
