  Given that porcine and human retinas have similar structures and characteristics , ex vivo culture of porcine neuroretina provides an attractive model for studying mechanisms of human retinal injury and degenerative disease. Here , we describe the method that was used to establish and characterize an adult porcine retina culture system as a rapid screening tool for retinal survival in real time. Neuroretina explants 8 mm in diameter were harvested from adult swine and cultured on porous cell culture inserts with adjustable heights. Retina explant viability was evaluated at 1 , 4 , 7 , 11 , and 14 days of culture using a resazurin-based metabolic assay. The explants were analyzed morphologically through immunohistochemistry for glial activation and apoptosis. Morphometric analysis was also performed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained retina sections from each time point. The viability of retina explants gradually decreased over time in culture. The laminar structure of the neuroretina was well preserved during the first 7 days. However , by day 14 , most explants showed significant loss of cells in each laminar layer and obvious thinning. Overall , the progressive<symptom> loss<symptom> of retinal lamination and thickness , and increase in apoptotic nuclei with activated hypertrophic MÃ¼ller cells were well correlated with the metabolic activity of the ex vivo neuroretina explants. This study was the first report to describe the use of a high-throughput and quantitative method for monitoring retina explant viability in real time. Ex vivo neuroretina cultures closely mimic the functional dynamics of the organ , and can be used efficiently to screen novel therapeutics for retinal neurodegenerative disease.
