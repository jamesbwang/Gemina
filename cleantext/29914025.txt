  Speech variations enable us to map the performance of cognitive processes of syntactic , semantic , phonological , and articulatory planning and execution. Speaking is one of the first functions to be affected by neurodegenerative complaints such as Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , which makes the speech a highly promising biomarker for detecting the illness before the first preclinical symptoms appear. This paper has sought to develop and validate a technological prototype that adopts an automated approach to speech analysis among older people. It uses a mathematical algorithm based on certain discriminatory variables to estimate the probability of developing AD. This device may be used at a preclinical stage by non-expert health professionals to determine the likelihood of the onset of AD.
