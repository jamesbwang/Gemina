  Patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment present more susceptibility to dental<disease> caries<disease> and the use of an orthodontic device increases this risk factor due to biofilm accumulation around the brackets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the shear bond strength to irradiated permanent teeth of orthodontic brackets bonded with conventional glass ionomer cement and resin-modified glass ionomer cement due to the fluoride release capacity of these materials. Ninety prepared human premolars were divided into 6 groups ( n = 15) , according to the bonding material and use or not of radiation: CR: Transbond XT composite resin; RMGIC: Fuji Ortho LC conventional glass ionomer cement; GIC: Ketac Cem Easymix resin-modified glass ionomer cement. The groups were irradiated ( I) or non-irradiated ( NI) prior to bracket bonding. The specimens were subjected to a fractioned radiation dose of 2 Gy over 5 consecutive days for 6 weeks. After the radiotherapy , the brackets were bonded on the specimens with Transbond XT , Fuji Ortho LC and Ketac Cem Easymix. After 24 h , the specimens were subjected to shear bond strength test. The image of enamel surface ( classified by Adhesive Remnant Index- ARI) was also evaluated and its frequency was checked among groups/subgroups. The shear bond strength variable was evaluated with ANOVA and Tukey 's post-hoc test. GIC group showed the lowest adhesion values among the groups ( p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference among non-irradiated and irradiated groups ( p > 0.05). As for the ARI , the CR-I group showed the highest material retention on enamel surface among the irradiated groups. RMGIC group showed the highest values for shear bond strength and presented ARI acceptable for clinical practices.
