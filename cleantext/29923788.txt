  The degradation of micropollutants ( MPs) , including pesticides , herbicides , pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds , by ozone-based advanced oxidation techniques ( AOP) was investigated in this study. The effect of different factors , such as ozone concentration , hydrogen peroxide concentration and initial pH , on the removal rate was studied in detail. The combination of UV with ozone/ H
