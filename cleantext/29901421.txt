  Frequent use of continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM) systems is associated with improved glycemic outcomes in persons with diabetes , but the need for calibrations and sensor insertions are often barriers to adoption. In this study , we evaluated the performance of G6 , a sixth-generation , factory-calibrated CGM system specified for 10-day wear. The study enrolled participants of ages 6 years and up with type 1 diabetes or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes at 11 sites in the United States. Participation involved one sensor wear period of up to 10 days. Adults wore the system on the abdomen; youth of ages 6-17 years could choose to wear it on the abdomen or upper buttocks. Clinic sessions for frequent comparison with reference blood glucose measurements took place on days 1 , 4-5 , 7 , and/or 10. Participants of ages 13 years and up underwent purposeful supervised glucose manipulation during in-clinic sessions. During the study , participants calibrated the systems once daily. However , analysis was performed on glucose values that were derived from reprocessed raw sensor data , independently of self-monitored blood glucose values used for calibration. Reprocessing used assigned sensor codes and a factory-calibration algorithm. Performance evaluation included the proportion of CGM values that were within ± 20 % of reference glucose values > 100 mg/dL or within ± 20 mg/dL of reference glucose values ≤ 100 mg/dL (/ 20) , the analogous/ 15 , and the mean absolute relative difference ( MARD , expressed as a percentage) between temporally matched CGM and reference values. Data from 262 study participants ( 21,569 matched CGM reference pairs) were analyzed. The overall/ 15 ,/ 20 , and MARD were 82.4 % , 92.3 % , and 10.0 % , respectively. Matched pairs from 134 adults and 128 youth of ages 6-17 years were similar with respect to/ 20 ( 92.4 % and 91.9 %) and MARD ( 9.9 % and 10.1 %). Overall/ 20 values on days 1 and 10 of sensor wear were 88.6 % and 90.6 % , respectively. The system 's `` Urgent Low Soon '' ( predictive of hypoglycemia within 20 min) hypoglycemia alert was correctly provided 84 % of the time within 30 min before impending biochemical hypoglycemia ( < 70 mg/dL). The 10-day sensor survival rate was 87 %. The new factory-calibrated G6 real-time CGM system provides accurate readings for 10 days and removes several clinical barriers to broader CGM adoption.
