  Oxytocin ( OXT) and its receptor ( OXTR) regulate reproductive physiology ( i.e. , parturition and lactation) , sociosexual behavior , learned patterns of behavior , and olfactory behavior in social contexts. To characterize the function of OXTR in basic olfactory behavior , the present study compared the behavioral responses of homozygous , heterozygous , and wild-type mice when these mice were confronted with an unpleasant odorant ( butyric acid) in a custom-made Y-maze in the absence of a social context. Wild-type mice avoided the first encounter with the butyric acid odorant , whereas homozygous and heterozygous mice did not. However , both heterozygous and wild-type mice habituated when confronted with the butyric odorant again on the following 2 days. By contrast , homozygous mice failed to habituate and instead avoided the location of the odorant for at least 3 days. These data suggest that homozygous and heterozygous mice display abnormal olfactory responses to the presentation of an unpleasant odorant. Our studies demonstrate that OXTR plays a critical role in regulating olfactory behavior in the absence of a social context.
