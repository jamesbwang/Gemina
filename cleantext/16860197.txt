  Soft tissue calcification is common in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism who have received long-term treatment with hemodialysis. However , calcifications in the breast parenchyma are not common. We report a case of a woman with dystrophic breast calcifications from secondary hyperparathyroidism. A 65-year-old woman presented with a palpable mass in her right breast which she had discovered 1 month ago. She had a medical history of end-stage renal disease. Mammography and ultrasound revealed large dystrophic calcifications in both breasts.<pathogen> Core needle biopsy was performed for calcifications in the right breast , and the pathologic diagnosis was dystrophic calcification in the stroma from secondary hyperparathyroidism. Reviewing our case will contribute to a fast and correct diagnosis in patients with dystrophic breast calcifications and lab results indicating secondary hyperparathyroidism , and will help discriminate these benign lesions<pathogen> from malignancies.
