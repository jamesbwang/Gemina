  Humoral immunity involves multiple checkpoints that occur duringin B-cell development , maturation , and activation. The pre-- B-cell receptor ( pre-BCR) is expressed following the productive recombination of the immunoglobulin heavy- chain gene , and. sSignalsing through the pre-BCR are is required for the differentiation of pre-B cells into immature B cells. However , the molecular mechanisms controlling the pre-BCR expression and signaling strength remain undefined. Herein , we probed the role of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated , stress-activated E3 ubiquitin ligase HMG-CoA reductase degradation 1 ( Hrd1) in B-cell differentiation. Using mice with a specific Hrd1 deletion in pro-B cells and subsequent B-cell developmental stages , we showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 governs a critical checkpoint during B- cell development. We observed that Hrd1 is required for degradation of the pre-BCR complex during the early stage of B- cell development. As a consequenceOf note , loss of Hrd1 in the B-cell lineage resulted in increased pre-BCR expression levels and a developmental defect in the transition from large to small pre-B cells. This defect , in turn , leading to theresulted in reduced fewer mature B cells in the bone<disease> marrow and peripheral lymphoid organs. Our studies results identified reveal a novel critical role of Hrd1 in controlling a critical checkpoint in B-cell-mediated immunity by and suggest that Hrd1 may functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the pre-BCR complex.
