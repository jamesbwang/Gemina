  Chipping is one of the concerns related to zirconia crowns. The reasons of chipping have not been completely understood. This in-vitro study aimed to assess the effect of coping design on the fracture resistance of all-ceramic single crowns with zirconia frameworks. Two types of zirconia copings were designed ( n = 12): ( 1) a standard coping ( SC) with a 0.5 mm uniform thickness and ( 2) a modified coping ( MC) consisted of a lingual margin of 1 mm thickness and 2 mm height connected to a proximal strut of 4 mm height and a 0.3mm-wide facial collar. After veneer porcelain firing , the crowns were cemented to metal dies. Afterwards , a static vertical load was applied until failure. The modes of failure were determined. Data were calculated and statistically analyzed by independent samples T-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The mean and standard deviation ( SD) of the final fracture resistance equaled to 3519.42 ± 1154.96 N and 3570.01 ± 1224.33 N in SC and MC groups , respectively; the difference was not statistically significant ( P = 0.9). Also , the mean and SD of the initial fracture resistance equaled to 3345.34 ± 1190.93 N and 3471.52 ± 1228.93 N in SC and MC groups , respectively ( P = 0.8). Most of the specimens in both groups showed the mixed failure mode. Based on the results , the modified core design may not significantly improve the fracture resistance.
