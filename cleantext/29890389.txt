  Herein , triphenylphosphonium cation moieties were incorporated into a dichloroacetophenone derivative , leading to the discovery of novel mitochondria-targeted and tumor-specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 ( PDK1) inhibitors. Biological studies suggested that all these synthesized compounds had significant in vitro activities , in particular compound 1f , which inhibited PDK1 with an EC
