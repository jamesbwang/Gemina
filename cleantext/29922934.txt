  This study investigates whether quantitative image analysis of pretreatment CT scans can predict volumetric response to chemotherapy for patients with colorectal liver metastases ( CRLM). Patients treated with chemotherapy for CRLM ( hepatic artery infusion ( HAI) combined with systemic or systemic alone) were included in the study. Patients were imaged at baseline and approximately 8 weeks after treatment. Response was measured as the percentage change in tumour volume from baseline. Quantitative imaging features were derived from the index hepatic tumour on pretreatment CT , and features statistically significant on univariate analysis were included in a linear regression model to predict volumetric response. The regression model was constructed from 70 % of data , while 30 % were reserved for testing. Test data were input into the trained model. Model performance was evaluated with mean absolute prediction error ( MAPE) and R 157 patients were included , split into training ( n = 110) and validation ( n = 47) sets. MAPE from the multivariate linear regression model was 16.5 % ( R Quantitative imaging features extracted from pretreatment CT are promising predictors of volumetric response to chemotherapy in patients with CRLM. Pretreatment predictors of response have the potential to better select patients for specific therapies. • Colorectal liver metastases ( CRLM) are downsized with chemotherapy but predicting the patients that will respond to chemotherapy is currently not possible. • Heterogeneity and enhancement patterns of CRLM can be measured with quantitative imaging. • Prediction model constructed that predicts volumetric response with 20 % error suggesting that quantitative imaging holds promise to better select patients for specific treatments.
