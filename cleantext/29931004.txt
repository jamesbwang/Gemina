  We report on the use of visible light as the driving force for the intramolecular dimerization of pendant anthracene groups on a methacrylic polymer to induce the formation of single-chain nanoparticles ( SCNPs). Using a 532 nm green laser light source and platinum octaethylporphyrin as a sensitizer , we first demonstrated the use of TTA-UC to dimerize monomeric anthracene , and subsequently applied this concept to dilute poly ( ( methyl methacrylate)- stat- ( anthracenyl methacrylate)) samples. A combination of triple-detection size-exclusion chromatography , atomic force microscopy , and UV-visible spectroscopy confirmed the formation of the SCNPs. This report pioneers the use of TTA-UC to drive photochemical reactions in polymeric systems , and showcases the potential for TTA-UC in the development of nanoobjects.
