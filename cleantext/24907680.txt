  The search for a simple and scalable approach that can improve the two key biopharmaceutical processes ( solubility and permeability) for BCS Class II and BCS Class IV has still been unmet need. In this study , L-lysine was investigated as a potential excipient to tackle problems with solubility and permeability. Bendazac ( Class II); quercetin and rutin ( Class IV) were employed. Drugs-lysine complexes in 1:1 M ratios were prepared by co-precipitation and co-grinding; characterized for solubility , partition coefficient , DSC , FTIR , SEM , dissolution rate and permeability. Chemical stability of quercetin-lysine and rutin-lysine was studied by assessing antioxidant capacity using Trolox and CUPRAC assays. Drugs-lysine salt/complexes were confirmed. Solubility enhancement factors ranged from 68- to 433-fold increases and dissolution rates were also significantly enhanced by up to 6-times , compared with drugs alone. With the exception of rutin-lysine , P
