  The early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis during infancy can be used in the evaluation of infants suspected of disorders of sex development ( DSD). However , few data exists on sex-specific reference ranges for these hormones during early life. To evaluate sex-differences in reproductive hormone concentrations in serum from healthy infants in order to define sex-specific cut-off values and to apply these in infants with DSD. A cross-sectional study. A tertiary center for pediatric endocrinology at the University Hospital of Copenhagen. 1,840 healthy infants and 27 DSD patients aged 2-5 months. Serum concentrations of LH , FSH , testosterone , estradiol , SHBG , inhibin B , AMH , DHEA , DHEAS , 17-OHP , androstenedione , and LH/FSH-ratio. LH and FSH concentrations showed overlap between sexes with LH being highest in boys and FSH being highest in girls. The LH/FSH-ratio separated infant boys from girls with minimal overlap at a cut-off value of 0.32. Inhibin B and AMH concentrations were markedly higher in boys compared to girls , with minimal or no overlap , respectively. In infants with Klinefelter syndrome<disease> , 45 , X/46 , XY mosaicism and male phenotype , and Turner syndrome<disease> , respectively , the LH/FSH-ratio matched the gender-of-rearing. However , infants with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome<disease> had LH/FSH-ratios within male range. Reference ranges for reproductive hormones and LH/FSH-ratio during mini-puberty were established in this study. The classifiers that best separated sex in mini-puberty were AMH , LH/FSH-ratio and testosterone. Use of the LH/FSH-ratio may add valuable information in the work-up of infants suspected of DSD.
