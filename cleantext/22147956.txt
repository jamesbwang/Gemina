  Thyroid diseases , including autoimmune thyroid diseases and thyroid cancer , are known to have high heritability. Family and twin studies have indicated that genetics plays a major role in the development of thyroid diseases. Thyroid function , represented by thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH) and free thyroxine ( T4) , is also known to be partly genetically determined. Before the era of genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) , the ability to identify genes responsible for susceptibility to thyroid disease was limited. Over the past decade , GWAS have been used to identify genes involved in many complex<disease> diseases<disease> , including various phenotypes of the thyroid gland. In GWAS of autoimmune thyroid diseases , many susceptibility loci associated with autoimmunity ( human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) , protein tyrosine phosphatase , non-receptor type 22 ( PTPN22) , cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 ( CTLA4) , and interleukin 2 receptor subunit alpha ( IL2RA)) or thyroid-specific genes ( thyroid stimulating hormone receptor ( TSHR) and forkhead box E1 ( FOXE1)) have been identified. Regarding thyroid function , many susceptibility loci for levels of TSH and free T4 have been identified through genome-wide analyses. In GWAS of differentiated thyroid cancer , associations at FOXE1 , MAP3K12 binding inhibitory protein 1 ( MBIP)- NK2 homeobox 1 ( NKX2-1) , disrupted in renal carcinoma 3 ( DIRC3) , neuregulin 1 ( NRG1) , and pecanex-like 2 ( PCNXL2) have been commonly identified in people of European and Korean ancestry , and many other susceptibility loci have been found in specific populations. Through GWAS of various thyroid-related phenotypes , many susceptibility loci have been found , providing insights into the pathogenesis of thyroid diseases and disease co-clustering within families and individuals.
