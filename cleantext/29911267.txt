  Bacterial cellulose spheres subjected to amination and inlaid modification with superparamagnetic molecules were analyzed with regard to possibility of their application as an immobilization carrier of Lecitase ® Ultra ( LU) enzyme. The starting point to obtain the carrier was synthesis of bacterial cellulose spheres performed in shaking cultures of Komagataeibacter xylinus. These spheres were subsequently subjected to a multi-stage modification to increase the efficiency of the immobilization process and to separate product from the reaction medium. Maximal yield of Lecitase ® Ultra immobilization equaled 70 %. It was also found that immobilization process did not affect the pH and LU temperature optimum. Moreover , immobilized enzyme exhibited similar temperature stability profile as its native form. The immobilization process did not significantly affect the enzyme K
