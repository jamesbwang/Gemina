  The leukocyte heme-enzyme MPO ( myeloperoxidase) exerts proinflammatory effects on the vascular system primarily linked to its catalytic properties. Recent studies have shown that MPO , depending on its cationic charge , mediates neutrophil recruitment and activation. Here , we further investigated MPO 's extracatalytic properties and its effect on endothelial glycocalyx ( EG) integrity. In vivo staining of murine cremaster muscle vessels with Alcian Blue 8GX provided evidence of an MPO-dependent decrease in anionic charge of the EG. MPO binding to the glycocalyx was further characterized using Chinese hamster ovary cells and its glycosaminoglycan mutants-pgsA-745 ( mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan) and pgsD-677 ( mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan) , which revealed heparan sulfate as the main mediator of MPO binding. Further , EG integrity was assessed in terms of thickness using intravital microscopy of murine cremaster muscle. A significant reduction in EG thickness was observed on infusion of catalytically active MPO , as well as mutant inactive MPO and cationic polymer polylysine. Similar effects were also observed in wild-type mice after a local inflammatory stimulus but not in MPO-knockout mice. The reduction in EG thickness was reversed after removal of vessel-bound MPO , suggesting a possible physical collapse of the EG. Last , experiments with in vivo neutrophil depletion revealed that MPO also induced neutrophil-mediated shedding of the EG core protein , Sdc1 ( syndecan-1). These findings provide evidence that MPO , via ionic interaction with heparan sulfate side chains , can cause neutrophil-dependent Sdc1 shedding and collapse of the EG structure.
