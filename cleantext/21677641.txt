  Translation of mRNA into protein has a fundamental role in neurodevelopment , plasticity , and memory formation; however , its contribution in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders is not fully understood. We investigated the involvement of MNK1/2 ( MAPK-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 and 2) and their target , eIF4E ( eukaryotic initiation factor 4E) , in depression-like behavior in mice. Mice carrying a mutation in eIF4E for the MNK1/2 phosphorylation site ( Ser209Ala , Eif4e ki/ki) , the Mnk1/2 double knockout mice ( Mnk1/2
