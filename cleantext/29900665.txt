  To examine the current patterns of end-of-life care of medical oncology patients dying in an Australian tertiary acute hospital setting in order to determine potential areas for improvement. A retrospective observational study was undertaken of 295 consecutive adult medical oncology inpatients dying between 2010 and 2015. Charts were reviewed for evidence of ( 1) resuscitation plans , ( 2) acute interventions in the 48-h period prior to death , ( 3) palliative care involvement and ( 4) recognition of the dying patient and comfort care plans. At the time of death , 98 % of patients had a resuscitation plan , 71 % of which were completed by the medical oncology team. Fifty-nine percent of medical emergency team reviews occurred in patients without a documented resuscitation plan. Within 48 h of death , active interventions were still being given to 64 % of patients in the total patient population. Comfort care plans were documented in 86 % of patients; however , 62 % of these were only documented within 48 h of death and 20 % of patients with a documented comfort care plan still received noncomfort measures. There was a high level of documented resuscitation plans , comfort care plans and recognition of dying. However , active interventions were common within 48 h of death , and comfort care plans and recognition of dying often occurred late. These data indicate a gap between documenting a resuscitation plan and providing timely and appropriate end-of-life care. Understanding the gaps in delivering appropriate care provides an opportunity for improving end-of-life care.
