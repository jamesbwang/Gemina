  Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2) is known to play an important role in the regulation of early embryonic development , differentiation , and cellular proliferation by introducing methyl groups onto lysine 27 of histone H3 ( H3K27me3). PRC2 is tightly associated with silencing of Hox gene clusters and their sequential activation , leading to normal development and differentiation. To investigate epigenetic changes induced by PRC2 during differentiation , deposition of PRC2 components and levels of H3K27me3 were extensively examined using mouse F9 cells as a model system. Contrary to positive correlation between PRC2 deposition and H3K27me3 level , down-regulation of PRC2 components by shRNA and inhibition of EZH1/2 resulted in unexpected elevation of H3K27me3 level at the Hox gene cluster despite its global decrease. We found that metal response element binding transcriptional factor 2 ( MTF2) , one of sub-stoichiometric components of PRC2 , was stably bound to Hox genes. Its binding capability was dependent on other core PRC2 components. A high level of H3K27me3 at Hox genes in
