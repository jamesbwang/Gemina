  At least two distinct processes occur during heating of the copper-exchanged mordenite in oxygen-free environment depending on the sample synthesis procedure. The first process corresponds to the reaction of Cu ( ii) sites with the residual traces of carbonaceous impurities left in the sample after the synthesis without calcination in an oxidant-containing environment , yielding Cu ( i) and carbon dioxide. The second relates to autoreduction of Cu ( ii) into Cu ( i) species accompanied with the release of molecular oxygen. The results show that to completely remove all traces of carbonaceous impurities and to avoid the loss of the active Cu ( ii) sites during the activation , copper-exchanged zeolite samples should be calcined in oxidative gases at elevated temperature and , preferentially , prior to the experiments to avoid the adsorption of organic compounds from air.
