  Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament ( OALL) in cervical spine is known to cause dysphagia<symptom>. However , dyspnoea and obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA) due to OALL is a rare entity. A 50-year-old man presented to our clinic 2 years after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF) with complaints of dysphagia<symptom> , dyspnoea and difficulty in sleeping supine. The clinico-neurological examination of patient was normal without any long tract signs. The diagnosis of OALL was made on plain lateral radiographs. Ultrasonic bone cutter was used to convert sessile osteophyte mass into a pedunculated mass. It was then disconnected from the anterior aspect of vertebral bodies with a chisel. The patient showed immediate relief from dysphagia<symptom> and OSA. Dyspnoea improved over a week and the postoperative change in voice responded well to speech therapy. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of dyspnoea due to OALL after ACDF.
