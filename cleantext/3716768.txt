  Neurological complications of systemic sarcoidosis are uncommon and the natural history and optimal treatments under-researched. With the advent of modern biological therapies , it is important to define the clinical characteristics and immunopathology of the disease. Patients referred to and treated within the Centre for Neurosarcoidosis over a 15 year period who had biopsy-proven `` highly probable '' disease of the central nervous system were studied prospectively. 166 patients were studied , of whom two-thirds had involvement of the brain and spinal cord and the remainder cranial neuropathies and radiculopathy. Imaging was abnormal in all those with meningeal and parenchymal diseases , and was normal in 37 % of those with cranial neuropathy. Those with leptomeningeal disease had a more severe disorder , with hydrocephalus<symptom> and tissue destruction , whereas those with pachymeningeal disease had more striking imaging features but less neurological impairment. The CSF was active in 70 % of cases , even when imaging was normal. Disability correlated with CSF indices in those with a leptomeningitis. Oligoclonal bands were seen in 30 % of cases and correlated with disability and the presence of hydrocephalus<symptom>. Unmatched bands were seen only in isolated neurological disease. This prospective study of neurosarcoidosis increases our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. A reclassification of the clinical and imaging features of the disease allows an understanding of its pathophysiology and correlation with CSF indices allows an early identification of those with a more destructive disease will help to define treatment and may thereby improve outcome.
