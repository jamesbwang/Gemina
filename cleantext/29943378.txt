  Plant probiotic mechanisms of endophytic microorganisms are highly remarkable as it play key role in growth and health of plants. Even though Burkholderia<pathogen> spp. have been studied for their role in plant growth and disease management , report on their field performance is very limited. Hence , the objective of the study was to investigate the plant probiotic performance of selected Burkholderia<pathogen> spp. on Capsicum frutescens. The results of the study showed bacterial influence on growth of C. frutescens with remarkable induction of early flowering and fruiting. Most interestingly , the plants treated with Burkholderia<pathogen> strains , ZoB74 and ZoB82 were found to have limited infestation with Bemisia tabaci. However , the control plants and those treated with Burkholderia<pathogen> ZoB86 were observed to have stunted growth with crumpled and curled leaves with no flowers or fruits. Hence , the study confirmed the strain specific potential of Burkholderia<pathogen> spp. in triggering the early flowering and fruiting in C. frutescens with associated protection from insect attack.
