  This is a case-control study investigating the personality profiles of children with vocal fold nodules<symptom> ( VFNs). Personality has been suggested as a contributing factor to VFN in adults and in children. However , previous studies in children have focused on psychopathologic traits and have reported contradictory findings. The aim of our study was to explore whether general , nonpathologic personality structure predicts the presence of VFN in children. Personality traits were measured in 34 children with VFN , aged 6.0-13.6 , and 34 age- and sex-matched normophonic controls by means of a pediatric five-factor personality questionnaire. Children with VFN were found to be significantly more extroverted than controls ( P = 0.022 , d = 0.61) , and a binary logistic regression showed that extraversion significantly predicted the presence of VFN in our population ( P = 0.027). The clinical implications of the results are discussed.
