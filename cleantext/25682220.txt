  Bosten Lake , the largest inland freshwater lake in China , has experienced drastic change over the past five decades. Based on the lake water balance<symptom> model and climate elasticity method , we identify annual changes in the lake 's water components during 1961-2016 and investigate its water balance<symptom>. We find a complex pattern in the lake 's water: a decrease ( 1961-1987) , a rapid increase ( 1988-2002) , a drastic decrease ( 2003-2012) , and a recent drastic increase ( 2013-2016). We also estimated the lake 's water balance<symptom> , finding that the drastic changes are caused by a climate-driven regime shift coupled with human disturbance. The changes in the lake accelerated after 1987 , which may have been driven by regional climate wetting. During 2003 to 2012 , implementation of the ecological water conveyance project ( EWCP) significantly increased the lake 's outflow , while a decreased precipitation led to an increased drought frequency. The glacier retreating trend accelerated by warming , and caused large variations in the observed lake 's changes in recent years. Furthermore , wastewater emissions may give rise to water degradation , human activity is completely changing the natural water cycle system in the Bosten Lake. Indeed , the future of Bosten Lake is largely dependent on mankind.
