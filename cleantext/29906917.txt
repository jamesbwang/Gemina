  Driven particles in the presence of crowded environment , obstacles , or kinetic constraints often exhibit negative differential mobility ( NDM) due to their decreased dynamical activity. Based on the empirical studies of conserved lattice gas model , two species exclusion model and other interacting particle systems we propose a new mechanism for complex many-particle systems where slowing down of certain non-driven degrees of freedom by the external field can give rise to NDM. To prove that the slowing down of the non-driven degrees is indeed the underlying cause , we consider several driven diffusive systems including two species exclusion models , misanthrope process , and show from the exact steady state results that NDM indeed appears when some non-driven modes are slowed down deliberately. For clarity , we also provide a simple pedagogical example of two interacting random walkers on a ring which conforms to the proposed scenario.
