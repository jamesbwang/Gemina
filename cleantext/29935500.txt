  The response of water re-solvating a charge-transfer dye ( deprotonated Coumarin 343) after photoexcitation has been measured by means of transient THz spectroscopy. Two steps of increasing THz absorption are observed , a first âˆ¼ 10 ps step on the time scale of Debye relaxation of bulk water and a much slower step on a 3.9 ns time scale , the latter of which reflecting heating of the bulk solution upon electronic relaxation of the dye molecules from the S
