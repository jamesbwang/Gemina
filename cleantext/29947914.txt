  This study assessed the effectiveness of limestone-montmorillonite-rapeseed residue-Si fertilizer compound amendment on the bioavailability and crop uptake of cadmium ( Cd) and enzyme activities in acidic paddy soils. Applying the compound amendment at ratios of 1 % -3 % increased soil pH by 0.1-1.9 units , decreased leaching ratios of soil Cd 4.0 % -22 % , and decreased exchangeable and carbonated Cd 42 % -55 % and 27 % -49 % , respectively. Organic matter-bound Cd increased 47 % -62 % ( p < 0.05). Cadmium concentrations decreased in the roots , culms , leaves , and grains of rice grown in the Cd-contaminated soils by 37 % -81 % , 18 % -73 % , 29 % -64 % and 27 % -63 % , respectively , ( p < 0.05). Catalase and urease activities increased 2.5 % -63 % and 3.9 % -36 % , ( p < 0.05) , respectively. Applying this compound amendment may significantly mitigate soil acidification and decrease the bioavailability and crop uptake of Cd in acidic Cd-contaminated paddy soils.
