  Up to 40 % of HIV-1 infected individuals are coinfected with human pegivirus<pathogen> type 1 ( HPgV-1). The majority , but not all studies reported a beneficial effect of HPgV-1 coinfection on HIV-1 disease progression. So far , the impact of different HPgV-1 genotypes ( GT) on different HIV-1 subtypes remains unclear. Peptides derived from HPgV-1 envelope protein E2 , and representing different viral genotypes , were synthesized using Fmoc/t-Bu based solid phase peptide synthesis. The inhibitory effect of these peptides on the infection of reporter cell lines was tested using an HIV-1 subtype panel representing clades A ( n = 2) , AG ( n = 2) , B ( n = 6) , C ( n = 2) , D ( n = 2) , F ( n = 2) , G ( n = 1) , G/H ( n = 1) , and group O ( n = 2). HIV-1 infection was blocked more efficiently by peptides derived from HPgV-1 GT2 than GT1 ( p = 0.05). The HIV-1 subtype did not affect the degree of inhibition by a peptide derived from HPgV-1 GT2. All CXCR4-/ dual-tropic isolates ( n = 12) , but only half ( four out of eight) CCR5-tropic viruses were inhibited by this peptide ( p = 0.014). Our data indicate that the inhibitory effect of peptides derived from HPgV-1 E2 protein is dependent on the genotype , suggesting that coinfection with HPgV-1 GT1 is less likely to confer a beneficial effect on HIV-1 disease progression than GT2. The preferential suppression of more pathogenic CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 by peptides derived from HPgV-1 GT2 may explain the favorable effect in subjects harboring these HIV-1 isolates. Consequently , HPgV-1 genotype and HIV-1 coreceptor tropism are likely determinants for the beneficial effect of HPgV-1 co-infection in HIV-1 infected individuals.
