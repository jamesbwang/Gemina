  For more than a century , the precision at which any protein ( or RNA) could be localized in living cells depended on the spatial resolution of microscopy. Light microscopy , even recently benchmarked laser-scanning microscopy , is inherently liable to the diffraction limit of visible light. Electron microscopy that had existed as the only alternative for decades is , in turn , of low through-put and sensitive to processing artefacts. Therefore , researchers have looked for alternative technologies particularly with ever-growing interest in resolving structural underpinnings of cellular heterogeneity in the human body. Computational ( ` in silico ') predictions provided only partial solutions given the incompleteness of existing databases and erroneous assumptions on evolutionarily-conserved sequence homology across species. A breakthrough that facilitates subcellular protein localization came with the introduction of ` super-resolution ' microscopy , which yields 20-60 nm resolution by overcoming diffraction-limited microscopy. The ensuing combination of ` super-resolution ' microscopy with unbiased proteomics continues to produce never-before-seen gains by quantitatively addressing the distribution , interaction , turnover and secretion of proteins in living cells. Here , we illustrate the power of this work-flow by the example of transmembrane receptor localization at the synapse formed by neurons. We also discuss how dynamic analysis allows for inferences be made for cellular physiology and pathobiology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
