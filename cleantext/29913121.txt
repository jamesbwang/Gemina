  Serum concentration of big endothelin-1 ( ET-1) has prognostic significance in heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , its prognostic value in cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) recipients has not been well-characterized. A cohort of 367 consecutive patients who received CRT between January 2010 and December 2015 were enrolled , and categorized into three groups according to baseline big ET-1 tertiles: big ET-1 â‰¤ 0.34 pmol/L ( N = 119) , big ET-1 between 0.34-0.56 pmol/L ( N = 127) and big ET-1 > 0.56 pmol/L ( N = 121). The primary endpoints included mortality rate ( all-cause) and heart transplantation. Over a median follow-up of 21 months , 48 ( 13.08 %) patients died , 6 ( 1.63 %) underwent heart transplantation and 100 ( 27.25 %) had heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalization ( HFH). We found a significant difference in event free survival between the three groups , with high levels of big ET-1 correlating with worse survival ( Log-rank test , P < .001). After adjusting for multiple factors in the multivariate model , big ET-1 > 0.56 pmol/L was an independent predictor for primary endpoint event ( hazard ratio ( HR): 2.005 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.045-6.2621 , P = .040) and HFH ( HR = 2.126 , 95 % CI 1.182-3.827 , P = .012). Baseline big ET-1 > 0.56 pmol/L was independently associated with higher all-cause mortality and HFH among CRT recipients , and therefore can be added to the marker panel used for stratifying high risk CRT patients for priority treatment.
