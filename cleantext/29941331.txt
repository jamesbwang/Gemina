  Previous studies have reported that the indication and starting dose of allopurinol may be associated with the incidence of hypersensitive reactions. As allopurinol-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCARs) constitute a significant proportion of drug injury relief applications in Taiwan , this study sought to examine allopurinol use and related adverse reactions through an analysis of recent drug injury relief applications. Allopurinol-related drug injury relief applications from 1999 to 2016 were collected , and descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze recent applications dating from 2011 to 2016. A total of 174 allopurinol-related drug injury relief applications were submitted between 2011 and 2016 , with the majority involving cases over the age of 65 ( 75.3 %; mean age of all cases was 69.2). Most allopurinol-related drug injuries concerned the skin ( 173 out of 174 cases , 99.4 %). The majority of cases had other co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease/hypertension ( 86.2 %) , chronic kidney disease ( 58.6 %) , or diabetes ( 46.6 %). Over 70 % of cases initiated allopurinol at a dose of 100 mg/day or less. Analysis revealed that the greatest number of cases ( 44.6 %) occurred in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) between 15 and 60 mL/min/1 .73 m Old age and renal dysfunction are key risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity<disease>. When considering allopurinol for elderly patients with impaired kidney function , a full risk-benefit assessment , dosage adjustments , and careful monitoring may be warranted.
