  Accurate estimation of energy expenditure ( EE) from accelerometer outputs remains a challenge in older adults. The aim of this study was to validate different ActiGraph ( AG) equations for predicting EE in older adults. Forty older adults ( age = 77.4 Â± 8.1 yrs) completed a set of household/gardening activities in their residence , while wearing an AG at the hip ( GT3X +) and a portable calorimeter ( MetaMax 3B- criterion). Predicted EEs from AG were calculated using five equations ( Freedson , refined Crouter , Sasaki and Santos-Lozano ( vertical-axis , vectormagnitude)). Accuracy of equations was assessed using root-mean-square error ( RMSE) and mean bias. The Sasaki equation showed the lowest RMSE for all activities ( 0.47 METs) and across physical activity intensities ( PAIs) ( range 0.18-0.48 METs). The Freedson and Santos-Lozano equations tended to overestimate EE for sedentary activities ( range: 0.48 to 0.97 METs) , while EEs for moderate-to-vigorous activities ( MVPA) were underestimated ( range: -1.02 to -0.64 METs). The refined Crouter and Sasaki equations showed no systematic bias , but they respectively overestimated and underestimated EE across PAIs. In conclusion , none of the equations was completely accurate for predicting EE across the range of PAIs. However , the refined Crouter and Sasaki equations showed better overall accuracy and precision when compared with the other methods.
