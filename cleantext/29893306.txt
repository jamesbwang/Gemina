  It has been shown that hesperidin induces apoptosis in NALM-6 cells through inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB) activation. To investigate the effect of hesperidin on inhibition of NF-κB activation through blocking phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K)/ Akt pathway as a main target in cancer treatment , in NALM-6 cells. NALM-6 cells were incubated with two concentrations of hesperidin ( 25 , 50 μM) in the presence or absence of insulin ( 100 nM) , as a potent activator of Akt. The cytotoxic activity of hesperidin was determined by 3- ( 4,5-methylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell apoptotic death was measured by ELISA test using cell death detection ELISA Hesperidin ( both concentrations) significantly reduced cells survival in the presence and absence of insulin compared to untreated cells in a time-dependent manner ( P < 0.05). Hesperidin also significantly increased apoptosis in NALM-6 cells even in hyperinsulinemia condition ( P < 0.0001). Hesperidin inhibited insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt , IκBα , and GSK-3β and decreased expression of IKKα. The results of this study demonstrated that cytotoxic and proapoptotic actions of hesperidin are partly mediated through the suppression of PI3K3/Akt/IKK signaling pathway. So , hesperidin might act as a chemotherapeutic agent by targeting cell survival pathways.
