  The shape of urban settlements plays a fundamental role in their sustainable planning. Properly defining the boundaries of cities is challenging and remains an open problem in the science of cities. Here , we propose a worldwide model to define urban settlements beyond their administrative boundaries through a bottom-up approach that takes into account geographical biases intrinsically associated with most societies around the world , and reflected in their different regional growing dynamics. The generality of the model allows one to study the scaling laws of cities at all geographical levels: countries , continents and the entire world. Our definition of cities is robust and holds to one of the most famous results in social sciences: Zipf 's law. According to our results , the largest cities in the world are not in line with what was recently reported by the United Nations. For example , we find that the largest city in the world is an agglomeration of several small settlements close to each other , connecting three large settlements: Alexandria , Cairo and Luxor. Our definition of cities opens the doors to the study of the economy of cities in a systematic way independently of arbitrary definitions that employ administrative boundaries.
