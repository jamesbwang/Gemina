  Enlarging LV pseudoaneurysms are a rare complication ( especially after surgical revascularization) and require tailored surgical decision-making and techniques for repair. We present a challenging case of a rapidly enlarging LV pseudoaneurysm four weeks after coronary bypass. The repair was approached via left thoracotomy utilizing circulatory arrest with selective antegrade cerebral perfusion.
