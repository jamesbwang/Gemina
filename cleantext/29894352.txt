  The perineural administration of alcohol or phenol results in protein denaturation and , consequently , neurolysis. This can produce long-lasting analgesia , with a duration of 3-6 months. Although neurolytic blocks for the brachial plexus have been described in multiple review articles and textbooks , they are rarely performed. As such , little is known about the efficacy and adverse effect profile of this commonly described treatment. In this article , we report the outcomes of a patient who underwent a left brachial plexus neurolytic block for the management of upper limb<symptom> pain<symptom> arising from a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.
