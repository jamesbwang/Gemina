  The KRAS gene mutation is the most common somatic change in colorectal carcinoma ( CRC) and is predictive of resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) therapy in the metastatic forms. Microsatellite instability ( MSI) , a mismatch repair ( MMR) system defect , accounts for 15-20 % of all CRCs , more frequent in early stages. CRCs with MSI present better prognosis , a distinct histopathological aspect and a different response to chemotherapy. Patients with both KRAS wild type and MSI have a reduced risk of dissemination and recurrence. Our study included formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 40 patients with metastatic CRCs , aged between 40 and 71 years old , gender ( males/females) ratio 2.33:1. The MMR proteins were analyzed using an indirect bistadial immunohistochemical ( IHC) technique with monoclonal antibodies. KRAS mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP) analysis. Of the 40 tumors analyzed , 40 % presented KRAS mutations located in codon 12 or codon 13. IHC expression of MMR proteins revealed a microsatellite stable status in 35 cases , including 15 cases with mutated KRAS. MSI status was identified in five cases ( four with KRAS wild type). All MSI tumors had a poorer histological differentiation and four cases revealed a mucinous phenotype. Eighty percent of the patients with MSI status were older women. Our study demonstrates a 20 % frequency of mutated KRAS in MSI CRCs , the incidence of KRAS mutations being inversely correlated with MSI status in these tumors. MMR protein deficient CRCs tend to occur in older females , have a poorer differentiation and are frequently associated with KRAS wild type.
