  Stroke in older age has reached epidemic proportions worldwide , and an increasing incidence has also been recognized in young adults and children. This chapter deals with stroke occurring in the cerebellum. Cerebellar stroke may present in a completely different way from common stroke syndromes<disease> in the anterior cerebral circulation. It can initially mimic benign vestibular neuritis and may later deteriorate into a life-threatening neurologic state. Posterior circulation stroke presents similarly in children and adults. However , the possibly mild symptoms and signs at onset are frequently overlooked by parents and also by healthcare professionals. We therefore aim to discuss the clinical presentation , treatment , causes , and prognosis of cerebellar stroke in both adults and children. Important differences between children and adults are discussed after each section.
