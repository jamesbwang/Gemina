  We compare two different sizes of honey bee colony units: singles ( one brood chamber) and doubles ( two brood chambers) in hybrid seed canola pollination in southern Alberta in 2014 and 2015. Currently , canola seed production companies only contract double-brood chamber units to pollinate canola in southern Alberta , but it may be advantageous to the industry if singles could also be contracted for pollination , as they are in many other crops. To evaluate the differences between the colony units , we measured population size , nectar and pollen foraging , nectar and pollen load weights , pollen collection , and honey production. The colony populations of both the single- and double-brood chamber hives<disease> in this study were highly variable. In 2015 , there was no difference between the single- and the double-brood chamber colonies in adult bee populations , and the singles had more sealed brood than did the double-brood chamber colonies. Our findings indicate that in comparison to doubles , on a per-frame basis , singles yield more pollen , more nectar foragers , similar or more pollen foragers , and similar amounts of honey. Therefore , we conclude that singles could be used to provide the same level of pollination services as doubles currently do in hybrid seed canola pollination , and growers should focus on receiving healthy populous colonies , regardless of the number of brood boxes.
