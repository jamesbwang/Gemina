  The restriction of Yin Yang 1 ( YY1) at BRCA2 and CDKN1A/p21-interacting protein ( BCCIP) transcriptional start site ( TSS) proximal region in several human cancer cell lines was found by analyzation of ChIP-Seq database from UCSC Genome Browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu). However , whether the stabilization of YY1 by BCCIP impacts its recruitment in the BCCIP promoter region is unclear. Here , we present evidence that transcriptional regulation of YY1 on BCCIP is closely related to YY1 stability in HCT116 human colon cancer cells. YY1 stabilization was in turn regulated by BCCIP , suggesting the existence of a BCCIP-YY1 feedback loop in regulating BCCIP transcription by the YY1. Overexpression of BCCIP stabilized YY1 while knockdown of BCCIP reduced YY1 protein level. In addition , direct interaction between YY1 and BCCIP was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation approach. Also , the N-terminus region of BCCIP , including the internal conserved domain ( ICD) , was responsible for binding with the amino acid 146-270 of YY1. More importantly , YY1 stability was related to the BCCIP/ICD domain-mediated YY1 ubiquitination pathway. Moreover , a limited BCCIP promoter region containing YY1 binding site ( CCGCCATC) was tightly associated with the pGL4-BCCIP-Luc luciferase activity. In ChIP assays , shBCCIP lentiviral-mediated YY1 instability decreased recruitment of the YY1 at BCCIP TSS proximal region , which could not be restored by YY1 overexpression. Furthermore , knockdown of YY1 inhibited the binding of BCCIP itself at BCCIP promoter region proximal to TSS , demonstrating that transcriptional regulation of the YY1 on BCCIP can be modulated by BCCIP itself in a YY1-dependent fashion.
