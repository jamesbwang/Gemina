  Clinical observations suggest neuronal control of bone remodeling. Sensory nerve fibers innervating bone , bone<disease> marrow and periosteum signal via neurotransmitters including substance P ( SP). In previous studies we observed impaired biomechanical and structural bone parameters in tachykinin ( Tac) 1-deficient mice lacking SP.. Here , we aim to specify effects of SP on metabolic parameters of bone<disease> marrow macrophage ( BMM)/ osteoclast cultures and osteoblasts isolated from Tac1-deficient and wildtype ( WT) mice. We demonstrated endogenous SP production and secretion in WT bone cells. Absence of SP reduced bone resorption rate , as we found reduced numbers of precursor cells ( BMM) and multinucleated osteoclasts and measured reduced cathepsin K activity in Tac1-/- BMM/osteoclast cultures. However , this might partly be compensated by reduced apoptosis rate and increased fusion potential of Tac1-/- precursor cells to enlarged `` super '' osteoclasts. Contrarily , increased ALP enzyme activity and apoptosis rate during early osteoblast differentiation accelerated osteogenesis and cell death in the absence of SP together with reduced ALP activity of Tac1-/- osteoblasts during late osteogenic differentiation resulting in reduced bone formation at later stages. Therefore , we suggest that absence of SP presumably results in a slight reduction of bone resorption rate but concomitantly in a critical reduction of bone formation and mineralization rate.
