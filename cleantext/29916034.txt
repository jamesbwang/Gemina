  Streptococcus<pathogen> thermophilus and S. macedonicus are the only two species of the genus related to food productions so far known. In the present study , eight S. thermophilus and seven S. macedonicus strains isolated from dairy environments in Italy were compared in order to evidence possible species-specific technological characteristics. Their capability to use lactose , galactose , fructose , and glucose , sugars commonly present in foods and two carbohydrates considered as prebiotics , xylose and inulin , along with the respective growth kinetics were studied. Results showed a luxuriant growth on lactose and different behaviors on galactose , glucose , and fructose. No growth on inulin and xylose was recorded , which is a positive feature for strains intended to be used as starter cultures. Growth parameters , namely , λ , µ
