  Implementing evidence-based practices requires a multi-faceted approach. Electronic clinical decision support ( ECDS) tools may encourage evidence-based practice adoption. However , data regarding the role of mobile ECDS tools in pediatrics is scant. Our objective is to describe the development , distribution , and usage patterns of a smartphone-based ECDS tool within a national practice standardization project. We developed a smartphone-based ECDS tool for use in the American Academy of Pediatrics , Value in Inpatient Pediatrics Network project entitled `` Reducing Excessive Variation in the Infant Sepsis<disease> Evaluation ( REVISE). '' The mobile application ( app) , PedsGuide , was developed using evidence-based recommendations created by an interdisciplinary panel. App workflow and content were aligned with clinical benchmarks; app interface was adjusted after usability heuristic review. Usage patterns were measured using Google Analytics. Overall , 3805 users across the United States downloaded PedsGuide from December 1 , 2016 , to July 31 , 2017 , leading to 14 256 use sessions ( average 3.75 sessions per user). Users engaged in 60 442 screen views , including 37 424 ( 61.8 %) screen views that displayed content related to the REVISE clinical practice benchmarks , including hospital admission appropriateness ( 26.8 %) , length of hospitalization ( 14.6 %) , and diagnostic testing recommendations ( 17.0 %). Median user touch depth was 5 ( IQR 5). We observed rapid dissemination and in-depth engagement with PedsGuide , demonstrating feasibility for using smartphone-based ECDS tools within national practice improvement projects. ECDS tools may prove valuable in future national practice standardization initiatives. Work should next focus on developing robust analytics to determine ECDS tools ' impact on medical decision making , clinical practice , and health outcomes.
