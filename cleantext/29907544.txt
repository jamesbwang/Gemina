  The significance of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3)- ITD mutation in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) prognosis has been well established. The aims of this study were to investigate the prognostic impact of the FLT3 protein ( CD135) expression and its association with FLT3-ITD mutation , and to identify its role in minimal residual disease. CD135 was measured by flow cytometry on leukemic blasts of 257 adults with de novo AML. High expression of CD135 ≥ 20 % was correlated with clinical , laboratory , and other prognostic factors that influenced treatment outcome. FLT3-ITD mutation was tested by PCR. The frequency of CD135 expression was 138 ( 53.7 %) of 257. FLT3-ITD was detected in ( 21.4 %). Positive CD135 expression was associated with high total leukocyte count ( P = .006) , platelet count ( P = .003) , monocytic leukemia<disease> ( P < .001) , and CD34 ( P = .008) and CD117 ( P = .006) expression. CD135 expression ≥ 25 % was a predictor of FLT3-ITD mutation ( P = .03). CD135 overexpression was a negative predictor of complete remission and of postinduction minimal residual disease at days 14 and 28 ( P < .001). CD135 had an adverse impact on overall and disease-free survival ( 68.5 % vs. 15 % , P = .002). Multivariate analysis indicated CD135 was the sole independent prognostic factor for overall survival ( hazard ratio = 2.49; 95 % confidence interval , 1.855-3.345; P < .001). CD135 is emerging as a prognostic factor , a new marker for minimal residual disease , and a potential novel therapeutic target of AML.
