  More evidence is needed about factors that influence self-management behaviors in persons with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. To test a correlational mediation model of the independent variables of health literacy , patient activation , and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> knowledge with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> self-management behaviors. The study used a prospective , cross-sectional , correlational design. Correlation and multiple regression were used to analyze associations among variables. Of 151 participants , 57 % were male , and mean age was 68 years. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> self-management behaviors was positively correlated with patient activation level ( p = .0008) , but not with health literacy or heart<symptom> failure<symptom> knowledge. Persons with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> may better manage their condition if sufficiently activated , regardless of their level of health literacy or knowledge of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> disease and management processes.
