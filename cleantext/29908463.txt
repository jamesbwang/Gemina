  Tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBPA) has attracted considerable attention due to its ubiquitous presence in different environmental compartments worldwide. However , information on its aerobic biodegradability in coastal environments remains unknown. Here , the aerobic biodegradation of TBBPA using a Pseudoalteromonas species commonly found in the marine environment was investigated. We found that extracellular biogenic siderophore , superoxide anion radical ( O
