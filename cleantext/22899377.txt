  Materials science has adopted the term of auxetic behavior for structural deformations where stretching in some direction entails lateral widening , rather than lateral shrinking. Most studies , in the last three decades , have explored repetitive or cellular structures and used the notion of negative Poisson 's ratio as the hallmark of auxetic behavior. However , no general auxetic principle has been established from this perspective. In the present article , we show that a purely geometric approach to periodic auxetics is apt to identify essential characteristics of frameworks with auxetic deformations and can generate a systematic and endless series of periodic auxetic designs. The critical features refer to convexity properties expressed through families of homothetic ellipsoids.
