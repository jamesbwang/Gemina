  Medical education is moving toward gender parity; however , many fields , including anesthesiology , remain predominantly male. The gender gap in anesthesiology is poorly recognized , and little is known about why it exists. It is possible that perceived workplace discrimination may deter women from pursuing a career in anesthesiology. We administered a survey to examine whether gender differences affect the experience of anesthesiology residents in the workplace. This study consisted of an analysis of responses to a survey administered in 2017 via REDCap to residents at an ACGME-accredited anesthesiology training program. The survey contained 30 questions adapted from validated tools for measuring attitudes and discrimination in the workplace. Ninety-eight residents received the survey and 83 ( 33 % female) completed it. Power calculations determined that with a sampling ratio of 3:1 , 1 % error rate and 80 % power , a future study would require 559 respondents. There was no difference in total composite score between male and female respondents; however , when considering only those items used to assess perceived discrimination , women scored higher. Analysis of individual items revealed that women were significantly more likely to feel that their gender put them at a disadvantage in the workplace , and to note sexist behavior at work. Female residents were significantly more likely to have experienced discrimination from patients , attending physicians , and residents. Our study revealed that female anesthesiology residents perceive more gender-based discrimination at work. Perceptions of workplace discrimination may contribute to the persistence of gender gaps in different areas of medicine.
