  The selective laser melting ( SLM) process was used to fabricate an Alloy718 specimen. The microstructure and creep properties were characterized in both the as-built and post-processed SLM materials. Post-processing involved several heat treatments and a combination of hot isostatic pressing ( HIP) and solution treatment and aging ( STA) to homogenize the microstructure. The experimental results showed that the originally recommended heat treatment process , STA-980 & deg; C , for cast and wrought materials was not effective for SLM-processed specimens. Obvious grain growth structures were obtained in the STA-1180 & deg; C/1 h and STA-1180 & deg; C/4 h specimens. However , the grain size was uneven since heavy distortion or high-density dislocation formed during the SLM process , which would be harmful for the mechanical properties of SLM-fabricated materials. The HIP + direct aging process was the most effective method among the post-processes to improve the creep behavior at 650 & deg; C. The creep rupture life of the HIP + direct aging condition approached 800 h since the HIP process had the benefit of being free of pores , thus preventing microcrack nucleation and the formation of a serrated grain boundary.
