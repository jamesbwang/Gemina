  The effects of desugarization using glucose oxidase/catalase and spray-drying conditions on gelling properties of duck albumen powder were studied. Gelling temperatures increased as spray-drying inlet temperatures ( 140-180C) were increased ( p < .05). Î”E * , a *- , and b *- values of gel increased but L * and whiteness decreased when higher spray-drying temperatures were used ( p < .05). However , whiteness and lightness of albumen gel were drastically increased after desugarization ( p < .05). Texture profile analysis showed that hardness , springiness , gumminess , and chewiness of gel decreased with increasing spray-drying temperatures. Moreover , gel of freeze-dried desugarized albumen powder had higher hardness , springiness , gumminess , and chewiness than that of spray-dried nondesugarized counterpart ( p < .05). Albumen gel prepared from desugarized albumen powder showed the compact network with more connectivity and smaller voids than that from nondesugarized one as visualized by scanning electron microscopy , regardless of drying conditions. Prior desugarization could lower browning and increased gelling properties of duck albumen powder. Higher spray drying inlet temperature generally exhibited the adverse effect on properties of resulting albumen powder. Both desugarization and drying conditions had the profound influence on characteristics and textural property of duck egg albumen.
