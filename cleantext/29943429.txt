  Triply-linked porphyrin arrays , so called porphyrin tapes , are intriguing molecules in terms of their planar structures , far red-shifted absorption bands , multi-charge storage abilities , and high conductivities. Recently , porphyrin tape variants such as porphyrin-expanded porphyrin hybrid tapes , porphyrin arch-tapes , corrole tapes , and a subporphyrin tape have been explored as novel Ï€-conjugated materials. These new molecules exhibit electronic and structural characteristics owing to direct triple linkages. This review first discusses the fundamental properties of the parent porphyrin tapes and the peripherally functionalized porphyrin tapes. Then , a main focus has been placed on the syntheses , structures , and unique properties of the recently explored porphyrin tape variants.
