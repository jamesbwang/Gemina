  In the present work , the effect of zeolite type and topology on CO ₂ and N ₂ permeability using zeolites of different topology ( CHA , RHO , and LTA) in the same Si/Al = 5 , embedded in poly ( trimethylsilyl-1-propyne) ( PTMSP) is evaluated with temperature. Several models are compared on the prediction of CO ₂/ N ₂ separation performance and then the modified Maxwell models are selected. The CO ₂ and N ₂ permeabilities through these membranes<symptom> are predicted with an average absolute relative error ( AARE) lower than 0.6 % taking into account the temperature and zeolite loading and topology on non-idealities such as membrane rigidification , zeolite ⁻ polymer compatibility and sieve pore blockage. The evolution of this structure ⁻ performance relationship with temperature has also been predicted.
