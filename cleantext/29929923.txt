  Thirty-day readmission rate has been proposed as metric of quality and remains an ongoing clinical concern in the primary treatment of patients with advanced-stage ovarian epithelial ovarian cancer. We conducted a review of the literature to identify rates , risk factors , and predictors for 30-day readmission in this population. A 10-year period MEDLINE ( PubMed) search of English literature studies published between January 01 , 2008-January 01 , 2018 was performed to identify appropriate studies for review. Thirty- day readmission rates for ovarian cancer patients undergoing primary treatment ranged from 2.5-19.3 %. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval cytoreductive surgery ( NACT-ICS) surgery was associated with lower readmission rates , when compared to primary debulking surgery ( PDS). The most frequently reported adverse events resulting in readmission include inpatient management of ileus/small bowel obstruction , wound-related complications , and thromboembolic events. Readmission predictors included the presence of other medical comorbidities , re-operation , and major complications occurring after initial hospital discharge. Some studies reported lower rates of readmission and survival in patients treated by NACT-ICS. Policies and programs should be designed to measure short- and long-term outcomes in this patient population to avoid bias in assigning patients to NACT-ICS to maintain low 30-day readmission rates.
