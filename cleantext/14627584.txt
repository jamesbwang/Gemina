  Abdominal image segmentation is a challenging , yet important clinical problem. Variations in body size , position , and relative organ positions greatly complicate the segmentation process. Historically , multi-atlas methods have achieved leading results across imaging modalities and anatomical targets. However , deep learning is rapidly overtaking classical approaches for image segmentation. Recently , Zhou et al. showed that fully convolutional networks produce excellent results in abdominal organ segmentation of computed tomography ( CT) scans. Yet , deep learning approaches have not been applied to whole abdomen magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) segmentation. Herein , we evaluate the applicability of an existing fully convolutional neural network ( FCNN) designed for CT imaging to segment abdominal organs on T2 weighted ( T2w) MRI 's with two examples. In the primary example , we compare a classical multi-atlas approach with FCNN on forty-five T2w MRI 's acquired from splenomegaly<symptom> patients with five organs labeled ( liver , spleen , left kidney , right kidney , and stomach). Thirty-six images were used for training while nine were used for testing. The FCNN resulted in a Dice similarity coefficient ( DSC) of 0.930 in spleens , 0.730 in left kidneys , 0.780 in right kidneys , 0.913 in livers , and 0.556 in stomachs. The performance measures for livers , spleens , right kidneys , and stomachs were significantly better than multi-atlas ( p < 0.05 , Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In a secondary example , we compare the multi-atlas approach with FCNN on 138 distinct T2w MRI 's with manually labeled pancreases ( one label). On the pancreas dataset , the FCNN resulted in a median DSC of 0.691 in pancreases versus 0.287 for multi-atlas. The results are highly promising given relatively limited training data and without specific training of the FCNN model and illustrate the potential of deep learning approaches to transcend imaging modalities.
