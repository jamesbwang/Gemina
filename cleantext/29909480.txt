  Based on intergroup contact theory , a proposed comprehensive model of attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help was tested , including both potential barriers to mental health help-seeking ( i.e. , public stigma and self-stigma of seeking help , prejudicial and essentialist beliefs about mental illness , intergroup anxiety<symptom>) and potential facilitators ( i.e. , direct and extended contact with persons with mental illness). Relevant measures were completed by 119 community-dwelling participants. Path analysis showed that direct ( but not extended) contact with mental illness , by reducing intergroup anxiety<symptom> , led to less negative beliefs about mental illness and weaker essentialist beliefs about mental illness ( the latter being directly and positively associated with negative beliefs about mental illness). Moreover , less negative beliefs about mental illness , by reducing perceptions of self ( but not public) stigma of seeking psychological help , were related to more positive attitudes towards help-seeking. Results are discussed in the context of the ( unintentional) adverse effects of biogenetic ( essentialist) explanations of mental disorders , and the clinical implications regarding interventions that aim at improving help-seeking attitudes.
