  A thorough study of the fermentation broth of three strains of Botrytis<pathogen> cinerea<pathogen> which were grown on a modified Czapek-Dox medium supplemented with 5 ppm copper sulphate , yielded five undescribed metabolites. These metabolites possessed a sesquiterpenoid ( +) -4-epi-eremophil-9-ene carbon skeleton which was enantiomeric to that of the phytoalexin , capsidiol. The isolation of these metabolites when the fungus was stressed , suggests that they may be potential effectors used by B. cinerea<pathogen> to circumvent plant chemical defences against phytopathogenic fungi<pathogen> The biosynthesis of these compounds has been studied using
