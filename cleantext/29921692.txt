  Translocations of retinoic acid receptor-α ( RARA) , typically PML-RARA , are a genetic hallmark of acute promyelocytic leukemia<disease> ( APL). However , because a small fraction of APL lack translocations of RARA , we focused here on APL cases without RARA translocation to elucidate the molecular etiology of RARA-negative APL. We performed whole-genome sequencing , PCR , and FISH for five APL cases without RARA translocations. Four of five RARA-negative APL cases had translocations involving retinoic acid receptor-β ( RARB) translocations , and TBL1XR1-RARB was identified as an in-frame fusion in three cases; one case had an RARB rearrangement detected by FISH , although the partner gene could not be identified. When transduced in cell lines , TBL1XR1-RARB homodimerized and diminished transcriptional activity for the retinoic acid receptor pathway in a dominant negative manner. TBL1XR1-RARB enhanced the replating capacity of mouse bone<disease> marrow cells and inhibited myeloid maturation of human cord blood cells as PML-RARA did. However , the response of APL with RARB translocation to retinoids was attenuated compared to that of PML-RARA , an observation in line with the clinical resistance of RARB-positive APL to ATRA. Our results demonstrate that the majority of RARA-negative APL have RARB translocations , thereby forming a novel , distinct subgroup of APL. TBL1XR1-RARB as an oncogenic protein exerts effects similar to those of PML-RARA , underpinning the importance of retinoic acid pathway alterations in the pathogenesis of APL.
