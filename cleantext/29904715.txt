  The article presents different mechanical , thermal and rheological data corresponding to the morphological formation within various renewable lignin-based composites containing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS) , acrylonitrile butadiene rubber ( NBR41 , 41 mol % nitrile content) , and carbon fibers ( CFs). The data of 3D-printing properties and morphology of 3D-printed layers of selected lignin-based composites are revealed. This data is related to our recent research article entitled `` A general method to improve 3D-printability and inter-layer adhesion in lignin-based composites '' ( Nguyen et al. , 2018 ( 1)).
