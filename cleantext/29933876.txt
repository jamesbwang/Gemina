  Molecular and functional imaging is increasingly being used to guide radiotherapy ( RT) management and target delineation. This review summarizes existing data in several disease sites of various functional imaging modalities , chiefly positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT) , with respect to RT target definition and management. For gliomas , differentiation between postoperative changes and viable tumor is discussed , as well as focal dose escalation and reirradiation. Head and neck neoplasms may also benefit from precise PET/CT-based target delineation , especially for cancers of unknown primary; focal dose escalation is also described. In lung cancer , PET/CT can influence coverage of tumor volumes , dose escalation , and adaptive management. For cervical cancer , PET/CT as an adjunct to magnetic resonance imaging planning is discussed , as are dose escalation and delineation of avoidance targets such as the bone<disease> marrow. The emerging role of choline-based PET for prostate cancer and its impact on dose escalation is also described. Lastly , given the essential role of PET/CT for target definition in lymphoma , phase III trials of PET-directed management are reviewed , along with novel imaging modalities. Taken together , molecular and functional imaging approaches offer a major step to individualize radiotherapeutic care going forward.
