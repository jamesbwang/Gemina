  We observe the excitation of collective modes in the terahertz ( THz) range driven by the recently discovered Néel spin-orbit torques ( NSOTs) in the metallic antiferromagnet Mn _ ( 2) Au. Temperature-dependent THz spectroscopy reveals a strong absorption mode centered near 1 THz , which upon heating from 4 to 450 K softens and loses intensity. A comparison with the estimated eigenmode frequencies implies that the observed mode is an in-plane antiferromagnetic resonance ( AFMR). The AFMR absorption strength exceeds those found in antiferromagnetic insulators , driven by the magnetic field of the THz radiation , by 3 orders of magnitude. Based on this and the agreement with our theory modeling , we infer that the driving mechanism for the observed mode is the current-induced NSOT. Here the electric field component of the THz pulse drives an ac current in the metal , which subsequently drives the AFMR. This electric manipulation of the Néel order parameter at high frequencies makes Mn _ ( 2) Au a prime candidate for antiferromagnetic ultrafast memory applications.
