  The association between gut microbiota and animal models of multiple sclerosis has been well established; however , studies in humans are scarce. We performed a descriptive , cross-sectional study comparing the relative composition of gut microbiota in 30 patients with multiple sclerosis ( 15 treated with interferon β-1b , 15 not receiving this treatment) and 14 healthy controls using next generation sequencing. Patients with multiple sclerosis and controls showed differences in the proportion of Euryarchaeota , Firmicutes , Proteobacteria , Actinobacteria , and Lentisphaerae phyla and in 17 bacterial species. More specifically , we found significant differences in the proportion of Firmicutes , Actinobacteria , and Lentisphaerae and 6 bacteria species between controls and untreated patients; however , these differences disappeared when compared with treated patients. Untreated patients showed a significant reduction in the proportion of Prevotella copri compared to controls , while the bacteria was significantly more abundant in patients treated with interferon β-1b than in untreated patients , with levels resembling those observed in the healthy control group. We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between patients with multiple sclerosis and controls , and between patients treated and not treated with interferon β-1b. In most cases , no differences were observed between treated patients and healthy controls , particularly for P. copri levels. This suggests that the clinical improvements observed in patients with multiple sclerosis receiving interferon β-1b may result from the effect of the drug on gut microbiota. Longitudinal and functional studies are necessary to establish a causal relationship.
