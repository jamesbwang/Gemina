  Infection with high-risk human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) has been linked to several human cancers , the most prominent of which is cervical cancer. The integration of the viral genome into the host genome is one of the manners in which the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 achieve persistent expression. The most well-studied cellular targets of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are p53 and pRb , respectively. However , recent research has demonstrated the ability of these two viral factors to target many more cellular factors , including proteins which regulate epigenetic marks and splicing changes in the cell. These have the ability to exert a global change , which eventually culminates to uncontrolled proliferation and carcinogenesis.
