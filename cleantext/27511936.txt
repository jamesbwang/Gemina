  Vitamin A plays an important role in human functions , which mainly come from foods. This study aims to examine dietary vitamin A intake and major food sources of Chinese adults. We analyzed the cross-sectional data from 12,246 adult aged 18 to 64 years old in 2015 China Nutritional Transition Cohort Study. Three consecutive 24-h dietary recalls combined with household weighing method were used to assess dietary vitamin A intake. The average dietary vitamin A intakes were 480.9 μg retinol equivalents ( RE) or 307.2 μg retinol activity equivalents ( RAE). The carotenes and retinol intake of subjects were 2084.7 μg/day and 133.5 μg/day , respectively. Approximately 87 % of adults consumed less vitamin A than the Chinese Estimated Average Requirement ( EAR) , and only 6 % of adults consumed more than Chinese Recommended Nutrient Intake ( RNI). Chinese adults derived vitamin A mainly from plant source foods , which is supplied as carotenes ( 67.4 % RE or 56.4 % RAE). Dark- and light- vegetables and fruits were major contributors of carotenes ( accounted for 84.2 %). The most import food sources of retinol were egg , meats and meat products , poultry , fish and milk , representing 94.7 % of retinol intake. The major four contributors of total vitamin A ( as both RE and RAE) were dark vegetables , egg , light vegetables , and meats and meat products. In conclusion , dietary vitamin A remains a problem for Chinese adults. Public health actions are needed to increase vitamin A intake in China.
