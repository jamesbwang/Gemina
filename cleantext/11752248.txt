  Genetic variation in cis-regulatory elements related to splicing machinery and splicing regulatory elements ( SREs) results in exon skipping and undesired protein products. We developed a splicing decision model to identify actionable loci among common SNPs for gene regulation. The splicing decision model identified SNPs affecting exon skipping by analyzing sequence-driven alternative splicing ( AS) models and by scanning the genome for the regions with putative SRE motifs. We used non-Hispanic Caucasians with neuroimaging , and fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and identified 17,088 common exonic SNPs affecting exon skipping. GWAS identified one SNP ( rs1140317) in HLA-DQB1 as significantly associated with entorhinal cortical thickness , AD neuroimaging biomarker , after controlling for multiple testing. Further analysis revealed that rs1140317 was significantly associated with brain amyloid-f deposition ( PET and CSF). HLA-DQB1 is an essential immune gene and may regulate AS , thereby contributing to AD pathology. SRE may hold potential as novel therapeutic targets for AD.
