  Towards the end of the 19th Century , Hering and Helmholtz were arguing about the fineness of visual acuity. In a talk given in 1899 , Hering finally established beyond reasonable doubt that humans can see spatial displacements smaller than the diameter of a foveal cone receptor , an ability we nowadays call ` hyperacuity ' and still the topic of active research. Hering suggested that this ability is made manifest by averaging across the range of locations stimulated during miniature eye movements<symptom>. However , this idea was made most clear only in a footnote to this ( not well known) publication of his talk and so was missed by many subsequent workers. Accordingly , particularly towards the end of the 20th Century , Hering has commonly been mis-cited as having proposed in this paper that averaging occurs purely along the lengths of the edges in the image. Here , we present in translation what Hering actually said and why. In Supplementary Material , we additionally translate accounts of some background experiments by Volkmann ( 1863) that were cited by Hering.
