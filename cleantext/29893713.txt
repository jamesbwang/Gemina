  The presence of certain volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) in the breath of patients with gastric cancer has been reported by a number of research groups; however , the source of these compounds remains controversial. Comparison of VOCs emitted from gastric cancer tissue to those emitted from non-cancerous tissue would help in understanding which of the VOCs are associated with gastric cancer and provide a deeper knowledge on their generation. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection ( GC-MS) coupled with head-space needle trap extraction ( HS-NTE) as the pre-concentration technique , was used to identify and quantify VOCs released by gastric cancer and non-cancerous tissue samples collected from 41 patients during surgery. Excluding contaminants , a total of 32 VOCs were liberated by the tissue samples. The emission of four of them ( carbon disulfide , pyridine , 3-methyl-2-butanone and 2-pentanone) was significantly higher from cancer tissue , whereas three compounds ( isoprene , Î³-butyrolactone and dimethyl sulfide) were in greater concentration from the non-cancerous tissues ( Wilcoxon signed-rank test , p < 0.05). Furthermore , the levels of three VOCs ( 2-methyl-1-propene , 2-propenenitrile and pyrrole) were correlated with the occurrence of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen>; and four compounds ( acetonitrile , pyridine , toluene and 3-methylpyridine) were associated with tobacco smoking. Ex vivo analysis of VOCs emitted by human tissue samples provides a unique opportunity to identify chemical patterns associated with a cancerous state and can be considered as a complementary source of information on volatile biomarkers found in breath , blood or urine.
