  Ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) is a common inflammatory bowel disease that can destroy the integrity of the colon and increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Oxidative stress is one of the critical pathogenic factors for UC , further impairing the entire affected colon. The Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway plays an important role in counteracting oxidative and electrophilic stress. Activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway provides an indispensable defense mechanism for the treatment of UC. In this study , we identified a novel effective Nrf2 activator , DDO7232 , which showed protective effects on NCM460 cells and therapeutic effects on DSS-induced colitis<disease> in mice. Mechanistic studies indicated that the Nrf2-ARE-inducing activity of DDO7232 was based on the activation of the ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Nrf2 Ser40 by p-ERK triggered the transport of Nrf2 into the nucleus and drove the expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant proteins. These results not only revealed the antioxidant mechanisms of DDO7232 but also provided an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of UC.
