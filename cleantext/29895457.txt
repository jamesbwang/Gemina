  In 2015 and 2016 the Central Unit of the Dutch National Police created and submitted 21 cartridge case comparison tests as real cases to the Netherlands Forensic Institute ( NFI) , under supervision of the University of Twente ( UT). A total of 53 conclusions were drawn in these 21 tests. For 31 conclusions the underlying ground truth was `` positive '' , in the sense that it addressed a cluster of cartridge cases that was fired from the same firearm. For 22 conclusions the ground truth was `` negative '' , in the sense that the cartridge cases were fired from different firearms. In none of the conclusions , resulting from examinations under casework conditions , misleading evidence was reported. All conclusions supported the hypothesis reflecting the ground truth. This article discusses the design and results of the tests in more detail.
