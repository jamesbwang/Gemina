  Clinical case The case concerns a 10-year-old boy of African origin , who suffered a mild ocular trauma to the left eye. Upon examination , the best visual acuity was 0.2 using the Snellen scale , with a 1 mm height hyphema , intraocular pressure ( IOP) of 12mmHg on left eye , with an increase up to 20mmHg within 72h. With a positive test for sickle cell disease , it was decided to treat medically with transcorneal oxygen therapy. Clearing of the anterior chamber was achieved , with and improvement in the best visual acuity to 0.8 , and lowering of IOP to 8mmHg. In the context of patients with persistent hyphema with sickle cell trait , transcorneal oxygen therapy is an effective alternative therapy. Achieving immediate and favourable results by lowering the IOP and improving the clearing of the anterior chamber.
