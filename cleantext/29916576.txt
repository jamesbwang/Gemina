  Smart fabrics and interactive textiles are a relatively new area of research , with many potential applications in the field of biomedical engineering. The ability of smart textiles to interact with the body provides a novel means to sense the wearer 's physiology and respond to the needs of the wearer. Physiological signals , such as heart rate , breathing rates , and activity levels , are useful indicators of health status. These signals can be measured by means of textile-based sensors integrated into smart clothing which has the ability to keep a digital record of the patient 's physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> since his or her last clinical visit , allowing doctors to make a more accurate diagnosis. Similarly , in rehabilitation , it is difficult for therapists to ensure that patients are complying with prescribed exercises. Smart garments sensing body<symptom> movements<symptom> have the potential to guide wearers through their exercises , while also recording their individual movements and adherence to their prescribed programme. In this paper , we present the new wireless textile system Sensoria , with pressure sensing capability for static posturography. The gold standard for static posturography is currently the use of a pressure or force plate but , due to their very complexity and expensiveness , the applicability outside laboratories is extremely limited. This paper focuses on the agreement between the static computed posturography assessed by means of a traditional stabilometric platform and the Sensoria system , in twenty subjects with Parkinson 's Disease ( PD). Preliminary results showed a significant agreement between the two methods , suggesting a clinical use of Sensoria for low cost home care based balance<symptom> impairment assessments.
