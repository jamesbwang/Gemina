  A series of alkali metal ( Li-Cs) alkoxides of tert-pentanol ( 1,1-dimethylpropan-1-ol) have been prepared by reaction of the corresponding metal with the alcohol in n-hexane or n-heptane. The compounds were purified by vacuum sublimation and crystallised in n-hexane to produce crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The structures of the potassium , rubidium , and caesium compounds revealed tetrameric units with additional intra- and intermolecular interactions between the metal atom and alkoxide methyl groups , increasing with the size of the metal involved.
