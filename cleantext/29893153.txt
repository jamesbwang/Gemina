  Considerable efforts have been devoted in the development of safe and efficient gene therapy for life-threatening or inherited diseases. The delivery alternatives play key roles in enhancing the therapeutic effect of nucleic cargo. To date , both the viral vectors and non-viral vectors were utilized and evaluated in clinical trials. With the improvement of material science and nanotechnologies , positively charged nanoparticles have emerged as potential gene delivery systems. In this review , we highlighted the clinical trials concerned with cationic nanocarrier mediated gene therapy. Both the toxicity and efficacy of the nanocarrier based therapeutics are summarized and discussed.
