  Nuclear receptor related-1 protein ( Nurr1) serves important roles in hippocampal-dependent cognitive process. In the present study , the protein expression of Nurr1 was compared in the hippocampi of young ( postnatal month 3 ( PM 3)) , adult ( PM 12) and aged ( PM 24) gerbils using western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Results indicated that the protein level of Nurr1 was significantly and gradually decreased in the gerbil hippocampus with increasing age. In addition , strong Nurr1 immunoreactivity was primarily observed in pyramidal neurons and granule cells of the hippocampus in the young group , which was determined to be reduced in the adult group and to a greater extent in the aged group. Collectively the data demonstrated that Nurr1 immunoreactivity was gradually and markedly decreased during normal aging. These results indicate that gradual decrease of Nurr1 expression in the hippocampus may be associated with the normal aging process and a decline in hippocampus-dependent cognitive function.
