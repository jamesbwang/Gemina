  Subglottic stenosis is a narrowing of the airway distal to the glottis. Airway narrowing can be severe and , when coupled with pregnancy , can pose a significant threat to the mother and fetus. There is sparse literature describing treatment of these critical patients , posing a challenge for management. We describe our experience with a 31-year-old woman with idiopathic subglottic stenosis who became symptomatic during her pregnancy , requiring surgical intervention early in her third trimester. The following case report describes this patient 's presentation and management , in which an awake dilation technique was used. We also include a literature review on the management of subglottic stenosis in pregnancy.
