  Mesoamerica is considered a biodiversity hot spot with levels of endemism and species diversity likely underestimated. Unfortunately , the region continues to experience some of the highest deforestation rates in the world. For mammals , the evolutionary relationships of many endemic taxa are controversial , as it is the case for members of the genus Handleyomys. Estimation of a time-calibrated hypothesis for the evolution of these six genera ( Euryoryzomys , Handleyomys , Hylaeamys , Nephelomys , Oecomys and Transandinomys) supported a monophyletic Handleyomys sensu lato. Based on their distinctive morphology and the amont of inter-generic genetic divergence , Handleyomys sensu stricto , H. alfaroi , the H. chapmani , and the H. melanotis species groups warrant recognition as separate genera. In addition , species delimitation documents the existence of cryptic species-level lineages within H. alfaroi and H. rostratus. Cryptic lineages within H. rostratus exhibited significant niche differenciation , but this was not the pattern among species-level clades within H. alfaroi. Similarly , age-range correlations revealed that niche evolution within Handleyomys is not correlated with evolutionary time , instead , ancestral climate tolerance reconstructions show niche disparities at specific diversification events within the chapmani and melanotis species groups , while the climatic niche of the rest of species of Handleyomys tended to be conservative.
