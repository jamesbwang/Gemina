  Adult onset seizure<symptom> disorder is a major public health concern in terms of burden of disease , nature of illness , and its impact on individual , family , and community. This study was done to assess the clinical profile and etiology of adult onset seizures<symptom> and correlates of clinical and radiological pattern. This was a prospective cross-sectional hospital-based study conducted on 100 cases presenting with adult onset seizures<symptom>. Adult onset seizures<symptom> were most prevalent in the young and middle-aged adults than elderly; generalized seizures<symptom> were more common than focal seizures<symptom>. However , the incidence of generalized seizures<symptom> showed a falling trend as the age advanced whereas focal seizures<symptom> increased in incidence with advancing age. Overall , the most common etiology of seizures<symptom> was stroke , followed by idiopathic and central nervous system infections; yet , most common etiology of adult onset generalized and focal seizures<symptom> was idiopathic and stroke , respectively. Regarding etiology , among younger adults , idiopathic seizures<symptom> were predominant , whereas among middle aged and elderly , stroke was the most common etiology. It is mandatory to deal carefully with each case of adult onset seizure<symptom> with a tailor-made approach. Identification and awareness about the etiological factors and seizure<symptom> type help in better management of these patients. Primary care physicians play a pivotal role in identifying patients with adult onset seizures<symptom> and should encourage these patients to undergo neuroimaging so as to arrive at an appropriate etiological diagnosis. In the face of recent advances in neuroimaging techniques , the future prospective management of adult onset seizures<symptom> appears bright and convincing.
