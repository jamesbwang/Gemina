  Optical upconversion that converts infrared light into visible light is of significant interest for broad applications in biomedicine , imaging , and displays. Conventional upconversion materials rely on nonlinear light-matter interactions , exhibit incidence-dependent efficiencies , and require high-power excitation. We report an infrared-to-visible upconversion strategy based on fully integrated microscale optoelectronic devices. These thin-film , ultraminiaturized devices realize near-infrared ( ∼ 810 nm) to visible ( 630 nm ( red) or 590 nm ( yellow)) upconversion that is linearly dependent on incoherent , low-power excitation , with a quantum yield of ∼ 1.5 %. Additional features of this upconversion design include broadband absorption , wide-emission spectral tunability , and fast dynamics. Encapsulated , freestanding devices are transferred onto heterogeneous substrates and show desirable biocompatibilities within biological fluids and tissues. These microscale devices are implanted in behaving animals , with in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrating their utility for optogenetic neuromodulation. This approach provides a versatile route to achieve upconversion throughout the entire visible spectral range at lower power and higher efficiency than has previously been possible.
