  Background Most carotid near-occlusions are indistinguishable from conventional ≥ 50 % stenosis on ultrasound , demonstrating high peak systolic velocity ( PSV) in the stenosis. Purpose To study whether the velocity distal to the stenosis can separate high PSV near-occlusion from conventional ≥ 50 % stenosis. Material and Methods We included patients with ≥ 50 % carotid stenosis with high PSV ( ≥ 125 cm/s) , examined with both computed tomography angiography ( CTA) and ultrasound within 30 days , and a distal velocity measurement was performed. Based on CTA , cases were divided into three groups: conventional stenosis; near-occlusion without full collapse ( NwoC; normal-appearing albeit small distal artery); and near-occlusion with full collapse ( NwC; threadlike distal artery). Distal Doppler ultrasound flow velocities were compared between these groups. Results Sixty patients were included: 33 patients with conventional stenosis; 20 patients with NwoC; and seven patients with NwC. Mean distal PSV was 93 , 63 , and 21 cm/s ( P < 0.001) and mean distal end-diastolic velocity was 30 , 24 , and 5 cm/s ( P < 0.001) , respectively. A distal PSV < 50 cm/s was 63 % sensitive and 94 % specific for separating both types of near-occlusion from conventional stenosis. Conclusion In high PSV carotid stenoses , the distal velocity was lower in near-occlusions than conventional carotid stenosis. Distal velocities warrant further investigation in diagnostic studies.
