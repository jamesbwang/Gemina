  Riboswitches are structured mRNA sequences that regulate gene expression by directly binding intracellular metabolites. Generating the appropriate regulatory response requires the RNA rapidly and stably acquire higher-order structure to form the binding pocket , bind the appropriate effector molecule and undergo a structural transition to inform the expression machinery. These requirements place riboswitches under strong kinetic constraints , likely restricting the sequence space accessible by recurrent structural modules such as the kink turn and the T-loop. Class-II cobalamin riboswitches contain two T-loop modules: one directing global folding of the RNA and another buttressing the ligand binding pocket. While the T-loop module directing folding is highly conserved , the T-loop associated with binding is substantially less so , with no clear consensus sequence. To further understand the functional role of the binding-associated module , a functional genetic screen of a library of riboswitches with the T-loop and its interacting nucleotides was used to build an experimental phylogeny comprised of sequences that possess a wide range of cobalamin-dependent regulatory activity. Our results reveal conservation patterns of the T-loop and its interaction with the binding core that allow for rapid tertiary structure formation and demonstrate its importance for generating strong ligand-dependent repression of mRNA expression.
