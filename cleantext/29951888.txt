  Acute lymphoblastic leukemias<disease> ( ALL) are malignant disorders of immature B or T cells that occur characteristically in children , usually under the age of 6 ( 75 %). Approximately 6000 new cases of ALL are diagnosed each year in the USA , 80-85 % of which represent B-ALL forms. Most presentations of B-ALL are leukemic , whereas T-ALL presents with a mediastinal mass , with or without leukemic involvement. The revised fourth edition of the World Health Organization ( WHO) classification ( 2017) has introduced some changes in both B and T-ALL. Here , we summarize the categories of lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas as defined by the WHO and recent developments in the understanding of this group of hematologic malignancy. Two provisional categories of B-ALL have now been identified including B-ALL , BCR-ABL1-like , and B-ALL with iAMP21. The Philadelphia chromosome-like B-ALL includes forms of the disease that shares the expression profiling of B-ALL with t ( 9; 22) but lack such rearrangement. The second one shows amplification of part of the chromosome 21. Both entities are associated with worse prognosis. Within the T-ALL group , an early precursor T cell form has now been introduced as a provisional category. Such group demonstrates expression of stem cell and myeloid markers in conjunction with the T cell antigens. The current review summarizes the recent updates to the WHO classification.
