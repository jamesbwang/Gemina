  The arm of the baroreflex ( BR) controlling peripheral resistances ( PR) , labeled as BR of PR ( prBR) , was characterized through an extension of the cardiac BR ( cBR) sequence analysis. The method exploits recordings of skin blood flow ( SBF) from the palm of the non-dominant hand via a laser Doppler flowmeter and of arterial pressure ( AP) from the middle finger of the same hand via a plethysmographic device. PR was estimated beat-by-beat as the ratio of mean AP to mean SBF computed over the same heart period ( HP). Peripheral resistances-diastolic arterial pressure ( PR-DAP) sequences featuring simultaneous increases of PR and decreases of diastolic AP ( DAP) or
