  We report a case of a 68-year-old white woman presenting with 5 sebaceous neoplasms , ranging from sebaceous adenoma to sebaceoma on histopathology. Despite the lack of a personal cancer history , her multiple sebaceous neoplasms and a paternal history of colon cancer prompted testing her sebaceous adenomas for microsatellite instability ( MSI) by immunohistochemistry. The results showed retained nuclear expressions of MLH1 and PMS2 while MSH2 and MSH6 proteins were absent. The tumor infiltrating lymphocytes expressed both MSH2 and MSH6 , providing reliable internal positive controls. Having a high probability for MSI , she was found to be heterozygous for a germline point mutation in MSH2 gene , where a pathologic variant , c. 1165C > T ( p.Arg389 *) , determined by sequencing confirmed Muir-Torre syndrome<disease> ( MTS). On further genetic counseling recommendations , one of her 2 sons was found to have colon cancer in the context of his MTS. In this article , we highlight and review the implications of MSI testing by both immunohistochemistry and sequencing as they relate to confirming the diagnosis of a suspected case of MTS.
