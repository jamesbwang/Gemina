  To identify preoperative predictors for postoperative shoulder imbalance ( PSI) after corrective surgery of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS) and using the fulcrum-bending radiograph to assess flexibility. A consecutive surgical cohort of AIS patients undergoing selective thoracic fusion with alternate-level pedicle screw fixation was prospectively studied. Preoperative anteroposterior , lateral and fulcrum-bending radiographs were analysed. Postoperatively , a minimum of 2 years clinical and imaging follow-up was performed of all patients. PSI was defined as a radiographic shoulder height difference of more than 20 mm. A total of 80 patients were included , and 14 patients ( 18 %) were confirmed with PSI at final follow-up. The flexibility of MT curve was an independent risk factor for PSI ( odds ratio ( OR) = 3.3 per 10 % decrease , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.6-8.2). Twenty-seven patients had a preoperative MT flexibility of < 55 % ( OR = 11.5 , 95 % CI 2.8-46.2). Postoperative T1 tilt was significantly higher in the PSI group ( p < 0.001) , and a T1 tilt of more than 9 Â° resulted in 7.2 times higher odds of developing PSI ( 95 % CI 2.0-26.0). Fulcrum-bending correction index ( FBCI) was significantly higher in the PSI group at final follow-up , and 25 patients had a final postoperative MT FBCI above 120 % ( OR = 8.5 ( 95 % CI 2.3-31.0). A low preoperative curve flexibility is a significant predictor for PSI. The surgical strategy should consider proximal fusion in presence of low-flexibility MT curves and consider less aggressive MT curve correction. Achieving a level T1 should be a main priority during intraoperative correction and may require fusion of the PT curve. III. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.
