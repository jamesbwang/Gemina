  The retrolaminar block ( RB) is used for truncal analgesia , but its mechanism of neural blockade remains obscure. We sought to learn the pattern of local anesthetic spread after thoracic RB using cadaveric models. In 8 fresh cadavers , an ultrasound-guided T4 RB was performed with 20 mL of methylene blue 1 % and bupivacaine 0.5 %. For comparison , an RB at T9 in 1 cadaver and a T4 thoracic paravertebral block in another cadaver were performed. Subsequently , posterior and anterior thoracic dissections were performed to examination where the dye spread. After T4 RB , dye was noted to spread in the ipsilateral retrolaminar plane ( all 8 cadavers , median cephalad spread 3.5 cm , caudad spread 10.7 cm , lateral spread 2.5 cm) , the contralateral retrolaminar plane ( 6 cadavers) , the paravertebral space ( 5 cadavers , median of 3 segments , T3-T5) , the intercostal space ( 5 cadavers , median of 3.5 cm laterally) , the T4 epidural space ( 6 cadavers) , and the intervertebral foramina ( 4 cadavers , median of 2 segments , T4-T5). After T9 retrolaminar injection , dye was noted in the ipsilateral retrolaminar plane ( 5.5 cm cephalad , 13.5 cm caudad , and 2.5 cm lateral) , the contralateral retrolaminar plane , and the epidural space. Dye after T4 traditional paravertebral block spread to T1-T6 paravertebral space with 15-cm lateral spread. Injectate spread to the paravertebral space , epidural space , intercostal space , and intervertebral foramina is possible in the RB but is quite variable. In comparison to the thoracic paravertebral block , injectate spread within the paravertebral space is more limited.
