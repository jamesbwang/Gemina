  Successful acquisition of survey data in any longitudinal study is key to reducing bias and determining reliable , generalizable findings. As part of a multicenter longitudinal study of patient-reported outcomes , a minimum benchmark for follow-up was set at 80 %. In review of our center 's participation , we found this benchmark was not consistently met. Thus , we identified a set of actions for study personnel concerning data acquisition for subject surveys. These actions , termed Best Practices , were implemented in January 2015. The purpose of this review is to determine whether the Best Practices were associated with improved follow-up. A comparison of success rates for the 6-months prior to and following program implementation was made. In addition , cell phone records for the 6-month period following implementation were reviewed for call characteristics ( e.g. minutes used , date , and time of call) , demographic representation ( call area code) , call timing ( day and time of week) , and call success. A `` successful call '' was defined as a call time longer than 5 minutes with acquisition of survey data. For the cell phone review , we attempted to reach a total of 98 subjects. Table 1 outlines information gleaned from the review of records following implementation of the Best Practices. Table 2 outlines the success rates for the two time periods compared ( significance set at < 0.05; two-tailed z-test). Use of the Best Practices by research personnel resulted in improved follow-up rates for 2 of 3 study time points. Of interest is the effort required to reach study participants by telephone with a success rate of only 12 % of all calls made. These data provide information that can be used by investigators as they plan future research and require evidence to substantiate personnel effort and/or Full-Time-Equivalent ( FTE<pathogen>) requirements.
