  Severe acidosis is one of the strongest predictors of neurologic outcomes in full-term infants with suspected hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. However , the relative importance of acidosis as a predictor of outcomes in preterm infants is much less clear. The goals of the present study were to examine the association between postnatal acidosis and severe intraventricular hemorrhage<symptom> ( IVH) and to establish a new score model including acid-base status after birth for predicting the risk of this morbidity. The study sample was very low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( VLBW) infants in the Korean Neonatal Network ( KNN) cohort registry , collected prospectively from January 2013 to December 2014. Infants with blood pH and base deficit ( BD) values collected within the first hour after birth , and documentation of severe IVH , were included. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to determine the contribution of postnatal acidosis to predicting severe IVH in VLBW infants. In addition , a prediction model was developed. Data from 2518 VLBW infants were analyzed. Infants with postnatal acidosis had a higher incidence of severe IVH. The clinical model plus blood BD values improved predictive performance , compared with models using only perinatal data or blood pH. A prediction model for severe IVH was developed using the KNN registry of VLBW infants. Immediate postnatal acidosis , defined based on blood BD , was associated with a higher-risk-adjusted incidence of severe IVH.
