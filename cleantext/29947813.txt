  The susceptibility vessel sign ( SVS) has been described on gradient echo ( GRE) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) in acute ischemic stroke patients by large vessel occlusion. The presence of SVS ( SVS +) was associated with treatment outcome and stroke etiology with conflicting results. Based on multicenter data from the THRombectomie des Art√®res CErebrales ( THRACE) study , we aimed to determine if the association between SVS and cardioembolic etiology ( CE) was independent of GRE sequence parameters. Patients with a pretreatment brain GRE sequence were identified. Logistic regression tested the association between SVS + , CE , time from onset to imaging and GRE sequence parameters ( e.g. echo time , voxel size , field strength). We calculated the sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values ( PPV and NPV) for the SVS to predict a stroke from a CE. An SVS + was observed in 237 out of 287 ( 83 %) patients. In the univariate analysis , there was a significant association between SVS + and a CE with an odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) of 2.10 ( 1.02-4.29) , respectively ( p = 0.04) but not with GRE sequence parameters. In multivariate analysis , there was an independent relationship between SVS + and CE ( OR ( 95 % CI): 2.14 ( 1.02-4.45) , p = 0.04). Sensitivity and specificity of SVS + to predict CE were 0.89 and 0.21 , respectively. The PPV and NPV of SVS + were 0.44 and 0.78 , respectively. The presence of SVS is associated to CE , independent of GRE sequence parameters. While the specificity and the PPV of the sign were low , CE seems less likely in the absence of an SVS.
