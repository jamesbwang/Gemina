  Carpometacarpal ( CMC) arthroplasty surgery , although modifications have occurred over time , continues to be commonly performed and has provided patients with their desired pain relief and return of function. The complications of primary surgery , although relatively rare , can present in various clinical ways. An understanding of the underlying anatomy , pathology of coexisting conditions , and specific techniques used in the primary surgery is required to make the best recommendation for a patient with residual pain following primary CMC arthroplasty. The purpose of this review is to provide insights into the history of CMC arthroplasty and reasons for failure and to offer an algorithmic treatment approach for the clinical problem of persistent postoperative symptoms.
