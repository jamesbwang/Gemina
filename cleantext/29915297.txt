  T cell-antigen receptor ( TCR) signaling requires the sequential activities of the kinases Lck and Zap70. Upon TCR stimulation , Lck phosphorylates the TCR , thus leading to the recruitment , phosphorylation , and activation of Zap70. Lck binds and stabilizes phosho-Zap70 by using its SH2 domain , and Zap70 phosphorylates the critical adaptors LAT and SLP76 , which coordinate downstream signaling. It is unclear whether phosphorylation of these adaptors occurs through passive diffusion or active recruitment. We report the discovery of a conserved proline-rich motif in LAT that mediates efficient LAT phosphorylation. Lck associates with this motif via its SH3 domain , and with phospho-Zap70 via its SH2 domain , thereby acting as a molecular bridge that facilitates the colocalization of Zap70 and LAT. Elimination of this proline-rich motif compromises TCR signaling and T cell development. These results demonstrate the remarkable multifunctionality of Lck , wherein each of its domains has evolved to orchestrate a distinct step in TCR signaling.
