  Surface integrity has attracted the attention of researchers for improving the functional performance of engineering products. Improvement in surface finish , one of the important parameters in surface integrity , has been attempted by researchers through different processes. Grinding has been widely used for final machining of components requiring smooth surfaces coupled with precise tolerances. Proper selection of grinding wheel material and grade with grinding parameters can result in an improved surface finish and improved surface characteristics. The present work reports the study of the effect of grinding parameters on surface finish of EN8 steel. Experiments were performed on surface grinding and cylindrical grinding for optimization of grinding process parameters for improved surface finish. Grinding wheel speed , depth of cut , table feed , grinding wheel material and table travel speed for surface grinding operation , and work speed for cylindrical grinding operation were taken as the input parameters with four types of grinding wheels ( Al
