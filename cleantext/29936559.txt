  To identify the findings on magnetic resonance imaging most strongly associated with meniscal ramp lesions<symptom> in patients with an anterior cruciate ligament tear. Seventy-eight consecutive patients ( mean age , 33.7 years; 64 male , 14 female) with an arthroscopically proven anterior cruciate ligament tear were included in this retrospective study. The presence of the following six features on magnetic resonance images were recorded: complete fluid filling between the posterior horn of the medial meniscus and the capsule margin; edema<symptom> affecting the posterior capsule; irregularity of the medial meniscus at the posterior margin; fluid at the periphery of the medial meniscus; the corner notch sign; and a vertical tear at the medial meniscus. Findings at arthroscopy served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy , sensitivity , and interobserver agreement were calculated. Seven ramp lesions<symptom> were noted on arthroscopy ( 9 %). Findings of irregularity at the posterior margin ( p = 0.001) and complete fluid filling between the posterior horn of the medial meniscus and the capsule margin ( p = 0.004) on magnetic resonance imaging were significantly associated with the presence of a ramp lesion<symptom>. With the irregularity at the posterior margin , sensitivity was 86 % and specificity was 79 %. Complete fluid filling sign showed sensitivity of 57 % and specificity of 92 %. Concordance of the two readers for the six magnetic resonance imaging features was fair to very good ( k = 0.38-0.91). Irregularity at posterior margin and complete fluid filling were most sensitive findings for detecting of a ramp lesion<symptom> on magnetic resonance imaging.
