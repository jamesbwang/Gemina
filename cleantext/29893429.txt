  Long Non-Coding RNA Reprogramming ( lncRNA-ROR) plays an important role in regulating various biologic processes , whereas the effect of lncRNA-ROR in osteoarthritis ( OA) is little studied. This study aimed to explore lncRNA-ROR expression in articular cartilage and identify the functional mechanism of lncRNA-ROR in OA. OA cartilage tissues were obtained from 15 OA patients , and 6 normal cartilage tissues were set as controls. Chondrocytes were isolated from the collected cartilage tissues. lncRNA-ROR was knockdown in normal cells and overexpressed in OA cells. Cell viability was determined with Cell Counting Kit-8 assay , and apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. Moreover , proteins and mRNAs involved in this study were also measured using Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR). Level of lncRNA-ROR was decreased in OA compared with normal chondrocytes , and overexpression of lncRNA-ROR dramatically promoted cell viability of OA chondrocytes. In addition , knockdown lncRNA-ROR inhibited apoptosis and promoted autophagy of normal chondrocytes. Moreover , lncRNA-ROR inhibited the expression of p53 in both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore , we revealed that lncRNA-ROR regulated apoptosis and autophagy of chondrocytes via HIF1Î± and p53. The results indicated that lncRNA-ROR played a critical role in the pathogenesis of OA , suggesting that lncRNA-ROR could serve as a new potential therapeutic target for OA.
