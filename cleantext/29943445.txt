  Site-independent ratings surveillance assessed ratings reliability in a clinical trial. Inter-rater reliability was assessed at the screen visit in a 6-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of lurasidone for the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD) with subthreshold hypomanic ( `` mixed '') symptoms ( clinicaltrials.gov NCT01421134). Site-based Montgomery-Asberg Depression<symptom> Rating Scale ( MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS) interviews were paired with 184 site-independent ratings derived from audio-digital recordings. The paired MADRS and YMRS scores were highly correlated ( r = 0.708 and 0.885 , respectively) and generated minimal scoring discordance. The surveillance program identified 14 MADRS scores ( 7.6 % of this sample) that were below the study entry criterion ( MADRS ≥ 26) and resulted in screen failure. When present , paired scoring discordance was associated with symptom severity , interview length , interview quality , and the level of patient cooperation. Higher severity scores ( MADRS ≥ 40 and YMRS ≥ 15) were associated with greater paired scoring discordance. Further , MADRS scores < 30 and short MADRS interviews conducted in ≤ 12 min revealed significantly more pairs of discordant outliers ( p = 0.04 and 0.009 , respectively). The findings suggest that MDD patients with mixed features can be reliably assessed , that paired site-based and site-independent assessments were generally concordant , and that ratings surveillance may reinforce ratings precision.
