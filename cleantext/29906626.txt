  In the field of antimicrobial resistance , the number of studies that use time series data has increased recently. The purpose of this study is the systematic review of all studies on antibacterial consumption and on Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> resistance in healthcare settings , that have used time series data. A systematic review of the literature till June 2017 was conducted. All the studies that have used time series data and have examined the inhospital antibiotic consumption and Ps. aeruginosa<pathogen> resistance rates or incidence were eligible. No other exclusion criteria were applied. Data on the structure , terminology used , methods used and results of each article were recorded and analyzed as possible. A total of thirty six studies were retrieved , twenty three of which were in accordance with our criteria. Thirteen of them were quasi experimental studies and ten were ecological observational studies. Eighteen studies collected time series data of both parameters and the statistical methodology of `` time series analysis '' was applied in nine studies. Most of the studies were published in the last eight years. The Interrupted Time Series design was the most widespread. As expected , there was high heterogeneity in regard to the study design , terminology and statistical methods applied.
