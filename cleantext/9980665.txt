  Equiatomic flower-like FeCo magnetic nanoparticles are synthesized through a modified one-pot polyol technique. The as-prepared samples are annealed at 700 and 800 Â°C under reducing atmosphere. The saturation magnetization and coercivity of the flower-like FeCo are found to be 198 ( 1) emu/g and 243 ( 10) Oe respectively. The magnetic properties of FeCo approach the bulk behavior with annealing. Positron lifetime studies on the chemically synthesized equiatomic FeCo magnetic nanoparticles with flower-like morphology are reported and compared with Fe , Co and FeCo annealed at various temperatures. The FeCo is characterized by different lifetime components corresponding to positron annihilation events in vacancies and various open volume defects due to their unique morphology. The studies suggest defects arising out of cluster vacancies and interpetal gap that reduce on annealing. The average pore size obtained from positron annihilation studies closely matches with the interpetal distance obtained from the electron microscopic analysis for the flower-like FeCo.
