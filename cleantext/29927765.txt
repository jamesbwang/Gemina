  Adoption of electronic personal health records by older adults offers multiple advantages to healthcare and is being encouraged by federal agencies and health associations. However , obstacles have limited older adults ' rates of adoption to approximately 10 %. This study examined the initial proficiency of older adults at entering 21 standard health elements into an electronic personal health record. Entry completeness , accuracy , elapsed time , and help requests were measured. A combination of standard technology adoption model and older adult characteristics accounted for 52 % of variability in proficiency at entering electronic personal health record data. Automatic linear modeling identified three variables as primarily related to proficiency with electronic personal health record use: age , computer competency , and mental<symptom> status<symptom>. Interventions to increase electronic personal health record adoption and proficiency of use will require the consideration of variables specific to older adults , and may best focus on younger seniors with good mental<symptom> status<symptom> and computer competency. Efforts for older seniors with decreased mental<symptom> status<symptom> might better center on delegation to a primary caregiver.
