  In head trauma cases involving antiplatelet agent treatment , the French Society of Emergency Medicine recommends performing computed tomography ( CT) scans to detect brain lesions<symptom> , 90 % of which are normal. The value of CT is still debatable given the scarce number of studies and controversial results. We used the RATED registry ( Registry of patient with Antithrombotic agents admitted to an Emergency Department , NCT02706080) to assess factors of cerebral bleeding related to antiplatelet agents following head trauma. From January 2014 to December 2015 , 993 patients receiving antiplatelet agents were recruited , 293 ( 29.5 %) of whom underwent CT scans for brain trauma. Intracranial bleeding was found in 26 ( 8.9 %). Multivariate analysis revealed these patients more likely to have a history of severe<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom> ( odds ratio ( OR): 8.47 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.56-45.82) , dual antiplatelet therapy ( OR: 6.46 , 95 % CI: 1.46-28.44) , headache<symptom> or vomiting<symptom> ( OR: 4.27 , 95 % CI: 1.44-2.60) , and abnormal Glasgow coma<symptom> scale ( OR: 8.60; 95 % CI: 2.85-25.99) compared to those without intracranial bleeding. The predictive model derived from these variables achieved 98.9 % specificity and a negative predictive value of 92 %. The area under the ROC curve ( AUROC) was 0.85 ( 95 % CI: 0.77-0.93). Our study demonstrated that the absence of history of severe<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom> , dual antiplatelet therapy , headache<symptom> or vomiting<symptom> , and abnormal Glasgow coma<symptom> scale score appears to predict normal CT scan following traumatic brain injury in patients taking antiplatelets. This finding requires confirmation by prospective studies. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02706080.
