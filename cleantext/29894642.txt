  We investigated the influence of immediate post-exercise dietary supplementation on the subsequent food consumption pattern and endurance exercise performance in physically trained individuals. On two occasions , trained male cyclists performed a glycogen-depleting exercise bout followed by a 2-hour nutritional supplementation period , 28 hours of free-living recovery , and a subsequent 40-km cycling time trial. During the 2-hour post-exercise supplementation , subjects consumed equal volumes of reduced-fat chocolate milk ( CM) or a sports beverage ( SB) in a single-blind , randomized design. Thereafter , cyclists maintained a food log during the free-living recovery period. Dietary and exercise performance parameters were compared between the treatment beverage visits. No differences in total caloric and macronutrient intakes over the course of free-living recovery were detected between the CM and SB trials. However , a significant interaction ( treatment × time) was detected for caloric and macronutrient intakes during the early phase of free-living recovery , such that significantly larger proportions were consumed shortly following SB as compared with CM. No difference was observed in completion time of the 40-km cycling time trial ( CM: 66.9 ± 4.1 vs SB: 66.9 ± 3.7 min). Hence , cyclists achieved similar levels of recovery during the prolonged , free-living period despite the different acute , post-exercise nutrient intake rates. We suggest that given adequate time , the athletes appear to unconsciously modify their food consumption in response to varied post-exercise supplementation such that subsequent day exercise performance is equivalent.
