  Against the background of the quality debates on long-term care and recurrent reform measures in politics on this topic , a critical discussion on the current state of quality development , testing and reporting in Germany is presented. In Germany , the linear model of Donabedian 's structural , process and outcome quality is still used as a basis for quality issues in nursing care; however , international research suggests that multiple and mutually interacting factors influence nursing quality and that a more systematic and systemic perspective for the further development of nursing quality ( especially of features , criteria and indicators of nursing quality) appears more appropriate. This article intends to open the perspective of the development , measurement and reporting of quality in nursing and to make a critical contribution for a systemic theory development as a relevant basis for future developments of quality evaluation programs and quality reporting systems in long-term care.
