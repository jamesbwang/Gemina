  Depression<symptom> rates are substantially higher among older adults in long-term care when compared with older adults in the community. Furthermore , the needs of older adults in long-term care are increasingly complex , and risk factors that contribute to depression<symptom> in this population are unclear. This limits not only the identification of those at risk for depression<symptom> but also the development of therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes the evidence on risk factors for depression<symptom> Searches were performed using CINAHL , Cochrane Library , Ovid Medline , PsycINFO and Scopus for research published 1980-2017. Data were reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA) statement. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria , representing a total of 11,703 participants , with a mean sample size of 1,064. The most consistently supported risk factor was cognitive impairment , followed by functional impairment and baseline depression<symptom> score. The studies lacked a systematic approach to investigating risk factors for depression<symptom> , and the research remains largely atheoretical. Few risk factors were consistently studied , with over 20 risk factors examined no more than once each. Psychological and environmental risk factors , which may be modifiable and have the potential to inform therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies , remain under-studied. The most consistently supported risk factors-cognitive impairment , functional disability and baseline depression<symptom> score-have the potential to inform screening protocols and should be monitored longitudinally. When developing psychotherapeutic interventions , close consideration should be given to cognitive and functional impairment as barriers to implementation and uptake.
