  Cyanobacteria can form dense and sometimes toxic blooms in freshwater and marine environments , which threaten ecosystem functioning and degrade water quality for recreation , drinking water , fisheries and human health. Here , we review evidence indicating that cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in frequency , magnitude and duration globally. We highlight species traits and environmental conditions that enable cyanobacteria to thrive and explain why eutrophication and climate change catalyse the global expansion of cyanobacterial blooms. Finally , we discuss management strategies , including nutrient load reductions , changes in hydrodynamics and chemical and biological controls , that can help to prevent or mitigate the proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms.
