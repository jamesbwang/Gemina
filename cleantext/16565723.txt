  Currently , no medical therapies exist to augment stroke recovery. Stem cells are an intriguing treatment option being evaluated , but cell-based therapies have several challenges including developing a stable cell product with long term reproducibility. Since much of the improvement observed from cellular therapeutics is believed to result from trophic factors the stem cells release over time , biomaterials are well-positioned to deliver these important molecules in a similar fashion. Here we show that essential trophic factors secreted from stem cells can be effectively released from a multi-component hydrogel system into the post-stroke environment. Using our polymeric system to deliver VEGF-A and MMP-9 , we improved recovery after stroke to an equivalent degree as observed with traditional stem cell treatment in a rodent model. While VEGF-A and MMP-9 have many unique mechanisms of action , connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF) interacts with both VEGF-A and MMP-9. With our hydrogel system as well as with stem cell delivery , the CTGF pathway is shown to be downregulated with improved stroke recovery.
