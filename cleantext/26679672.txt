  Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers ( MERRF) syndrome<symptom> is characterized by myoclonus , generalized epilepsy , cerebellar ataxia<symptom> , and ragged red fibers ( RRFs) in the muscle. T-to-C transition at nucleotide position 14709 in the mitochondrial tRNA glutamic acid ( tRNA Clinical information of a 17-year-old patient was collected; muscle biopsy and next-generation sequencing ( NGS) of whole mitochondrial and neuromuscular disease panel were then conducted. Finally , sanger sequencing was carried out to confirm the mutations. The patient presented a typical MERRF phenotype with muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> , epileptic<symptom> seizure<symptom> , clonic episodes , cerebellar ataxia<symptom> , and spinal scoliosis. Muscle biopsy showed RRFs which indicated abnormal mitochondrial functions. NGS of whole mitochondrial gene revealed m.T14709C mutation , confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We present a sporadic patient with typical MERRF presentation carrying the mutation of m.T14709C , which expanded the spectrum of m.T14709C.
