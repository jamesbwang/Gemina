  There is significant current interest in the application of magnetic ( magnetite or maghemite) nanoparticles functionalised with chelating agents for the environmental remediation of metal contaminated waters and solutions. Whilst there is a body of knowledge about the potential remediation efficacy of such engineered nanoparticles from studies involving synthetic solutions of single metals , there is relatively little data involving mixed-metal solutions and virtually no studies about nanoparticle performance in chemically complex environmental solutions representing those to which a scaled-up nanoremediation process might eventually be applied. Therefore , we investigated the ability of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ( DTPA)- functionalised , silica-coated maghemite nanoparticles to extract potentially toxic ( Cd , Co , Cu) and `` non-toxic '' ( Ca , Mg) metals from solution ( initial ( metal) = 10 mg L
