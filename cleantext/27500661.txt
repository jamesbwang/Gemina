  The burden of multimorbidity is a growing clinical and health system problem that is known to be associated with socioeconomic status , yet our understanding of the underlying determinants of inequalities in multimorbidity and longitudinal trends in measured disparities remains limited. We included all adult respondents from four cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey ( CCHS) ( between 2005 to 2011/12) , linked at the individual-level to health administrative data in Ontario , Canada ( pooled n = 113,627). Multimorbidity was defined at each survey response as having â‰¥ 2 ( of 17) high impact chronic conditions , based on claims data. Using a decomposition method of the Erreygers-corrected concentration index ( C Multimorbidity prevalence in 2011/12 was 33.5 % and the C A pro-rich income gap in multimorbidity has persisted in Ontario from 2005 to 2011/12. These empirical findings suggest that to advance equality in multimorbidity prevalence , policymakers should target chronic<disease> disease<disease> prevention and control strategies focused on older adults , non-married persons and those that are physically inactive , in addition to addressing income disparities directly.
