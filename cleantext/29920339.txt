  The role of surgical resection for patients with recurrent or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors is still controversial. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the clinical outcomes of surgery combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors among patients with recurrent or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We systematically searched PubMed , EMBASE , the Cochrane Library and Wanfangdata without language restriction. Random effect models were used to estimate pooled hazard ratio and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses , sensitivity analysis and trim and fill analysis were also performed. A total of 1416 patient from 9 studies were finally enrolled in this meta-analysis. The summary results showed that surgery combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors showed a tendency of a longer overall survival compared with tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment alone ( HR by random-effects model 0.68 , 95 % CI 0.54-0.85 , I Surgery combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy is associated with a better overall survival and progression free survival for patients with recurrent or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors as compared with TKIs treatment alone.
