  A versatile and efficient method for the synthesis of 3-chalcogenyl-indoles from indoles and dichalcogenides employing t-BuOK as a promoter at room temperature has been achieved. The present protocol exhibited a broad functional group tolerance. Diverse 3-sulfenyl- and 3-selenyl-indoles were rapidly obtained in good to excellent yields with high regioselectivities. It is noteworthy that this transformation was applicable to N-protected and N-unprotected indoles , allowing N-deprotection and C3-chalcogenylation of indoles in one step.
