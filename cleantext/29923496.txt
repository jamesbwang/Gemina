  This study aimed to quantify the sensitivity and specificity of time-resolved point dose measurements. Criteria were defined to assess whether errors would cause a clinically relevant dose deviation during patient treatment. The sensitivity and specificity were determined based on verification measurements of five error-free plans and 84 intentional error plans. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was conducted to quantify the efficiency of the method. In addition , the specificity of the method was investigated in more detail by assessing its ability to identify different error modes. For measurements made at planning target volume locations , a moderate sensitivity ( 65 % ± 13 %) , specificity ( 76 % ± 12 %) , and an area under the curve ( AUC) equal to 0.77 were obtained for a quality control ( QC) acceptance criterion of 2 %. Measurements made at organ at risk ( OAR) locations had high sensitivity ( 80 % ± 20 %) , but low specificity ( 54 % ± 13 %) , and an AUC equal to 0.70. The low specificity for OAR locations could be traced to the impact of a small couch tilt on measurement locations at larger distances from the isocentre , resulting in increased shielding by multi-leaf collimator ( MLC) leaves. Further analysis showed that output errors and errors affecting the penumbra region can be resolved on a per measurement basis with moderate to high sensitivity ( 100 % and 67 % for errors in output , and in the penumbra region , respectively) and high specificity ( 77 % and 85 % for errors in output , and in the penumbra region , respectively). This can potentially result in saving time investigating failing QC measurements.
