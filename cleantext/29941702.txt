  The mean ( SD) serum hepcidin levels in 40 thalassemia children ( 15.8 ( 2.9) ng/mL) were comparable to those seen in 40 healthy controls ( 15.1 ( 3.0 ng/mL) ( P = 0.3). The hepcidin/ferritin ration in thalassemia children was significantly lower ( P < 0.001) suggesting that hepcidin levels were not increased in proportion to the iron overload.
