  A multitude of ultrathin crystal needles are formed during the evaporation of saturated aqueous NaCl solution droplets in the presence of amide containing additives. The needles are as small as 300 nm wide and 100-1000 μm in length. Heating experiments , X-ray diffraction , and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed that the needles are cubic sodium chloride crystals with the needle length direction pointing toward ( 100). This shape , not expected for the 43 ̅
