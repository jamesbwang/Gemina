  Recent advances in the field of metabolomics have established the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a powerful genetic model for studying animal metabolism. By combining the vast array of Drosophila genetic tools with the ability to survey large swaths of intermediary metabolism , a metabolomics approach can reveal complex interactions between diet , genotype , life-history events , and environmental cues. In addition , metabolomics studies can discover novel enzymatic mechanisms and uncover previously unknown connections between seemingly disparate metabolic pathways. In order to facilitate more widespread use of this technology among the Drosophila community , here we provide a detailed protocol that describes how to prepare Drosophila larval samples for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS)- based metabolomic analysis. Our protocol includes descriptions of larval sample collection , metabolite extraction , chemical derivatization , and GC-MS analysis. Successful completion of this protocol will allow users to measure the relative abundance of small polar metabolites , including amino acids , sugars , and organic acids involved in glycolysis and the TCA cycles.
