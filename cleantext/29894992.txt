  There is a need for more experimental research on weight stigma and physical activity , specifically among men with obesity. Yet , validated procedures are required. The goal of this study was i) to develop a 10-min video instrument for the experimental induction of physical activity-related weight stigma ( including a neutral control video) , and ii) to collect information with regards to its content , face , construct , and criterion validity. To ensure content and face validity , two experts gave repeated feedback on the video development. In addition , two novices reviewed the video. Subsequently , we conducted a separate experiment: 60 adult men ( 18-52 years , 31 with overweight , 29 with normal weight) were randomly assigned to one of the two video conditions , stratified by BMI. After the treatment , the stigma group showed higher scores of negative affect and attitudes against obesity ( convergent validity). As expected , there were no differences in measures of depression<symptom> and general stress ( discriminant validity). The BMI of the participants in the stigma group correlated positively with some indicators of negative affect ( criterion validity). Our study provides preliminary evidence for the validity of the video tool. Therefore , it can be used in future trials to investigate the effects of weight stigma on physical activity behavior.
