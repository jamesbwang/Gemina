  The intestinal barrier dysfunction is a critical pathological change in irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Prim-O-glucosylcimifugin ( POG) on intestinal barrier dysfunction and reveal possible molecular mechanisms. Caco-2 cell monolayers induced by tryptase ( TRYP) were used to establish an intestinal barrier dysfunction model. Caco-2 cell monolayers from both functional and dysfunctional samples were treated with POG ( 30 , 60 and 120 Âµg/mL) for 2 , 8 , 24 , 36 , 48 and 72h. The Caco-2 cell monolayers were assessed by measurement of trans-epithelial electrical resistance ( TEER) and percentage of fluorescein permeation ( PFP). The expression of PAR-2 and MLCK mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR and the level of ZO-1 protein expression was determined by western blot. In addition , the impact of POG on the distribution of the tight juction protein of Occludin was performed by immunofluorescence. Our results showed that POG elevated the TEER and decreased the PFP of the functional Caco-2 cell monolayers , as well as the dysfunctional Caco-2 cell monolayers. Furthermore , POG inhibited the expression of PAR-2 mRNA and MLCK mRNA and increased the level of ZO-1 protein expression in dysfunctional Caco-2 cells. The distribution of the Occludin proteins was ameliorated simultaneously. This study demonstrates that POG can enhances the intestinal barrier function of Caco-2 cell monolayers by inhibiting the expression of PAR-2 and MLCK and up-regulating the expression of ZO-1 protein , and ameliorated the distribution of Occludin protein.
