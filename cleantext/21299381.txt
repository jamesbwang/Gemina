  The main aim is to determine whether growth pattern had an effect on the upper airway by comparing different craniofacial patterns with pharyngeal<symptom> widths and its importance during the clinical examination. Sixty lateral cephalograms of patients aged between 16 and 24 years with no pharyngeal<symptom> pathology or nasal obstruction were selected for the study. These were divided into skeletal Class I ( Statistically significant difference exists between the upper-airway dimensions in both the skeletal malocclusions with hyperdivergent growth patterns when compared to other growth patterns. In both the skeletal malocclusions , vertical growers showed a significant decrease in the airway size than the horizontal and normal growers. There is no statistical significance between the lower airway and craniofacial growth pattern.
