  Numerous studies have confirmed that prelinguistic utterances are precursors to speech , and there is ample evidence that , for example , frequency of canonical syllables and syllable inventory size correlate with speech and language measures at older ages. Traditionally , prelinguistic utterances have been assessed by phonetic transcription which is difficult and time-consuming in infants. Recently , a more time-efficient methodology to assess prelinguistic utterances in real time , called naturalistic listening , was developed ( Ramsdell et al. , 2012). In a large international NIDCR-funded randomized controlled trial , Timing of Primary Surgery for with Cleft Palate ( TOPS) , including many coders , a software program ( TimeStamper) was developed to assist in coding of prelinguistic vocalizations in real time , to ensure consistency of the coding procedures. Coders upload a video ( or audio) file and watch and listen to the recording in real time without any possibility of pausing or taking notes. In real time , the coder registers each speech-like syllable as canonical or non-canonical. TimeStamper automatically calculates the percentage of canonical syllables of all syllables registered ( canonical babbling ratio). At the end of a recording , TimeStamper assists in assessing presence/absence of canonical babbling and syllable inventory size.
