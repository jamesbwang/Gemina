  A search for the rare decay Σ ^ ( +) → pμ ^ ( +) μ ^ (-) is performed using pp collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment at center-of-mass energies sqrt ( s) = 7 and 8 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb ^ ( -1). An excess of events is observed with respect to the background expectation , with a signal significance of 4.1 standard deviations. No significant structure is observed in the dimuon invariant mass distribution , in contrast with a previous result from the HyperCP experiment. The measured Σ ^ ( +) → pμ ^ ( +) μ ^ (-) branching fraction is ( 2.2 _ ( -1.3) ^ ( +1.8)) × 10 ^ ( -8) , where statistical and systematic uncertainties are included , which is consistent with the standard model prediction.
