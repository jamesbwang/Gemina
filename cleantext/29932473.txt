  Amplification of DNA is required as a mandatory step during library preparation in most targeted sequencing protocols. This can be a critical limitation when targeting regions that are highly repetitive or with extreme guanine-cytosine ( GC) content , including repeat expansions associated with human<disease> disease<disease>. Here , we used an amplification-free protocol for targeted enrichment utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system ( No-Amp Targeted sequencing) in combination with single molecule , real-time ( SMRT) sequencing for studying repeat elements in the huntingtin ( HTT) gene , where an expanded CAG repeat is causative for Huntington disease. We also developed a robust data analysis pipeline for repeat element analysis that is independent of alignment of reads to a reference genome. The method was applied to 11 diagnostic blood samples , and for all 22 alleles the resulting CAG repeat count agreed with previous results based on fragment analysis. The amplification-free protocol also allowed for studying somatic variability of repeat elements in our samples , without the interference of PCR stutter. In summary , with No-Amp Targeted sequencing in combination with our analysis pipeline , we could accurately study repeat elements that are difficult to investigate using PCR-based methods.
