  The activation of brain nociceptors and neurons may lead to neurogenic inflammation<symptom> , an event that involves immune cells including mast cells ( MCs). Microglia are similar to macrophages and secrete pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and TNF. TNF is rapidly released ( first 10 minutes from MC granules) and is subsequently secreted along with other pro-inflammatory cytokines with a new synthesis after several hours. MC-derived TNF is a very powerful pro-inflammatory cytokine which mediates sensitization of the meningeal nociceptors. Here , we report the involvement of MCs in neuroinflammation , the role of inflammatory cytokine IL-1 family members , and of TNF , as well as the potential inhibition of IL-37.
