  Poly ( 4-vinylphenol) ( PVP) is a promising gate dielectric material for organic field-effect transistors ( OFETs) and circuits fabricated on plastic substrates. Thermal cross-linking of PVP with a cross-linker , such as poly ( melamine- co-formaldehyde) methylated ( PMF) , at a high temperature ( above 170 Â°C) is widely considered an effective method to remove residual hydroxyl groups that induce polarization effects in the dielectric bulk. However , the threshold voltage shift in transfer characteristics is still observed for an OFET with a PVP-PMF dielectric when it is operated at a slow gate voltage sweep rate. The present study examines the cause of the undesired hysteresis phenomenon and suggests a route to enable a reliable operation. We systematically investigate the effect of the PVP-PMF weight ratio and their annealing temperature on the transfer characteristics of OFETs. We discover that the size of the hysteresis is closely related to the concentration of nonhydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups in the dielectric bulk and this is controlled by the weight ratio. At a ratio of 0.5:1 , a complete elimination of hysteresis was observed irrespective of the annealing temperature. We finally demonstrate a highly reliable operation of small-molecule-based OFETs fabricated on a plastic substrate at a low temperature.
