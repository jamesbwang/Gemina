  Russia has had a high elderly share of its population like the OECD countries , but has had a more turbulent history over the past 100 years , which has caused fluctuations in the capabilities of those turning 60 ( measured by education and training , income , enabling environment , medical care , and health status). This article analyses the life experiences and capabilities of five Russian birth cohorts turning 60 over the period 1990-2020. It presents relevant concepts , reviews past research , and evaluates the importance of health factors ( health environment , health-related behaviours , medical care , health status) in determining the activities and contributions of older people in Russia. A Human Capabilities of the Elderly in Russia Index ( HCERI) with 22 indicators is developed. Russian data are used in the calculation of the HCERI for the cohorts turning 60 in 1990 , 1995 , 2000 , 2010 and 2020. The article then presents evaluations of the experiences and changes in capabilities for each of the five selected cohorts of the elderly in four periods of life: Childhood ( 1-15 years) , Young Adult<disease> ( 16-49) , Mature Adult<disease> ( 50-59) , and Early Elderly ( 60-69). The implications of changes in the characteristics of the elderly for Russian government policies are discussed.
