  Predicting the rate of adaptation to environmental change in wild populations is important for understanding evolutionary change. However , predictions may be unreliable if the two key variables affecting the rate of evolutionary change-heritability and selection-are both affected by the same environmental variable. To determine how general such an environmentally induced coupling of heritability and selection is , and how this may influence the rate of adaptation , we made use of freely accessible , open data on pedigreed wild populations to answer this question at the broadest possible scale. Using 16 populations from 10 vertebrate species , which provided data on 50 traits ( relating to body mass , morphology , physiology , behaviour and life history) , we found evidence for an environmentally induced relationship between heritability and selection in only 6 cases , with weak evidence that this resulted in an increase or decrease in the expected selection response. We conclude that such a coupling of heritability and selection is unlikely to strongly affect evolutionary change , even though both heritability and selection are commonly postulated to be dependent on the environment.
