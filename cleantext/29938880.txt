  We assessed evidence for changes in efficacy of food-based interventions aimed at reducing appetite<symptom> or energy intake ( EI) , and whether this could be used to provide guidance on trial design. A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials testing sustained efficacy of diets , foods , supplements or food ingredients on appetite<symptom> and/or EI. Trials had to include sufficient exposure duration ( â‰¥ 3 days) with appetite<symptom> and/or EI measured after both acute and repeated exposures. Twenty-six trials met the inclusion criteria and reported data allowing for assessment of the acute and chronic effects of interventions. Most ( 21/26) measured appetite<symptom> outcomes and over half ( 14/26) had objective measures of EI. A significant acute effect of the intervention was retained in 10 of 12 trials for appetite<symptom> outcomes , and six of nine studies for EI. Initial effects were most likely retained where these were more robust and studies adequately powered. Where the initial , acute effect was not statistically significant , a significant effect was later observed in only two of nine studies for appetite<symptom> and none of five studies for EI. Maintenance of intervention effects on appetite<symptom> or EI needs to be confirmed but seems likely where acute effects are robust and replicable in adequately powered studies.
