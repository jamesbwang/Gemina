  Whiteflies ( Bemisia tabaci) are phloem feeders , and some invasive species are composed of cryptic species complexes that cause extensive crop damage , particularly via the direct transmission of plant viruses. Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death essential for organismal development and tissue homeostasis. The caspases belong to a family of cysteine proteases that play a central role in the initiation of apoptosis in many organisms. Here , we employed a comprehensive genomics approach to identity caspases in B. tabaci Middle<pathogen> East Asia Minor<pathogen> 1 ( MEAM1) , an invasive whitefly that carries a cryptic species complex that is devastating to crops. Four caspase genes were identified , and their motif compositions were predicted. Structures were relatively conserved in both putative effector and initiator caspases. Expression patterns of caspase genes differed across insect developmental stages. Three caspase genes were induced immediately after ultraviolet ( UV) treatment. Expression levels of Bt-caspase-1 and Bt-caspase-3b increased in the midgut and salivary glands during apoptosis induced by UV treatments , whereas silencing of both genes reduced UV-triggered apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that Bt-caspase-1 and Bt-caspase-3b act as putative initiator and effector apoptotic caspases in the MEAM1 whitefly , respectively. This article is protected by copyright.
