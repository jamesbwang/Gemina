  Intraspecific population diversity ( specifically , spatial asynchrony of population dynamics) is an essential component of metapopulation stability and persistence in nature. In 2D systems , theory predicts that metapopulation stability should increase with ecosystem size ( or habitat network size): Larger ecosystems will harbor more diverse subpopulations with more stable aggregate dynamics. However , current theories developed in simplified landscapes may be inadequate to predict emergent properties of branching ecosystems , an overlooked but widespread habitat geometry. Here , we combine theory and analyses of a unique long-term dataset to show that a scale-invariant characteristic of fractal river networks , branching complexity ( measured as branching probability) , stabilizes watershed metapopulations. In riverine systems , each branch ( i.e. , tributary) exhibits distinctive ecological dynamics , and confluences serve as `` merging '' points of those branches. Hence , increased levels of branching complexity should confer a greater likelihood of integrating asynchronous dynamics over the landscape. We theoretically revealed that the stabilizing effect of branching complexity is a consequence of purely probabilistic processes in natural conditions , where within-branch synchrony exceeds among-branch synchrony. Contrary to current theories developed in 2D systems , metapopulation size ( a variable closely related to ecosystem size) had vague effects on metapopulation stability. These theoretical predictions were supported by 18-y observations of fish populations across 31 watersheds: Our cross-watershed comparisons revealed consistent stabilizing effects of branching complexity on metapopulations of very different riverine fishes. A strong association between branching complexity and metapopulation stability is likely to be a pervasive feature of branching networks that strongly affects species persistence during rapid environmental changes.
