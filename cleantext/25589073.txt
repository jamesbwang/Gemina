Failure or breakdown of immunological tolerance results in autoimmunity. CD28 is an important co-stimulatory receptor expressed on T cells that , upon specific ligand binding , delivers signals essential for full T-cell activation and for the development and homeostasis of suppressive regulatory T cells.
