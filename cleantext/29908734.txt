  Mercury is a globally distributed , environmental contaminant. Quantifying the retention and loss of mercury is integral for predicting mercury-sensitive ecosystems. There is little information on how dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) concentrations and particulates affect mercury photoreaction kinetics in freshwater lakes. To address this knowledge gap , samples were collected from ten lakes in Kejimkujik National Park , Nova Scotia ( DOC: 2.6-15.4 mg/L). Filtered ( 0.2 Î¼m) and unfiltered samples were analysed for gross photoreduction , gross photooxidation , and net reduction rates of mercury using pseudo first-order curves. Unfiltered samples had higher concentrations ( p = 0.04) of photoreducible divalent mercury ( Hg ( II)
