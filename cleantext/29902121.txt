  The residue depletion of niclosamide ( NIC) in freshwater fish including blunt snout bream ( Megalobrama amblycephala) , yellow catfish ( Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) and channel catfish ( Ietalurus Punetaus) were investigated under laboratory conditions. NIC concentrations in fish were determined by Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) with heated electrospray ionisation. The mean recoveries were in the range of 75.5-98.5 % , with relative standard deviations ranging from 1.0 to 9.4 %. The depletion results showed that the long half-life of NIC was 8.8-22.1 days. Risk assessment of NIC residue in edible tissues ( muscle and skin) of the three species of freshwater fish was performed using the quotient ( RQ) , because of no maximum residue limit ( MRL) has been set for NIC in fish. The results demonstrated that the RQ values were all significantly lower than 1. Therefore , the effect of NIC residues in the three species of freshwater fish at the immersion concentration was negligible to Chinese people.
