  Placental insufficiency is one of the major risk factors for growth restriction and preeclampsia. The aim of this study is to investigate whether recombinant human Thrombomodulin ( r-TM) improves fetal conditions and physiological outcomes. We used CBA/J × BALB/C mice as a control and CBA/J × DBA/2 mice- a well-studied model of recurrent spontaneous miscarriage. Pregnant mice received daily subcutaneous injections of r-TM or saline from day 0-15. The fetal resorption rate , fetal weight , and litter size were calculated at day 15. Additionally , we analyzed the mRNA expression of angiogenic factors and the concentration of soluble Flt-1 ( sFlt-1) using the ELISA kit. The rate of fetal resorption in CBA/J × DBA/2 mice treated with r-TM was significantly lower compared with mice without r-TM treatment. Additionally , fetal weight and litter size were also significantly higher in the r-TM treated mice. Fibrinogen deposition in the labyrinth area of the CBA/J × DBA/2 mice treated with r-TM was significantly lower compared with deposits in the mice untreated with r-TM. As well , r-TM significantly increased the gene expression level of VEGF and Flt-1 mRNA in the placentas of the CBA/J × DBA/2 mice. r-TM treatment also significantly decreased the production of sFlt-1 protein in the placentas of preeclampsia-like diseased mice. r-TM as an anticoagulation therapy has the potential for the medical treatment of recurrent miscarriage and fetal growth restriction due to improved angiogenic factors. Additionally , r-TM treatment has the potential for the recovery of preeclampsia.
