  This study examined the effects of one single bout daily versus triple bouts of resistance exercise for 12 weeks on muscular strength and anaerobic performance of the upper body. Twenty young male adults ( age: 22.0 ± 1.0 years , bench press: 44.0 ± 10.3 kg) were randomly assigned to a single bout ( SB) or triple bouts ( TB) of resistance exercise group. Maximal strength and anaerobic performance of the upper body using the bench press ( one-repetition maximum) and the modified 30 s Wingate test were determined before and after the intervention. Additionally , changes in lactate levels before and after the Wingate test were measured. Although the SB and TB groups showed a significant increase in maximal strength ( post-intervention , SB: 67.2 ± 9.2 and TB: 67.6 ± 7.6 kg , respectively) compared with the values at pre-intervention ( SB: 44.6 ± 11.4 and TB: 43.9 ± 8.7 kg , respectively) , there was no significant difference for this variable between the two groups post-intervention (
