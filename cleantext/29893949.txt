  Psychological distress increases morbidity in ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) and Crohn 's disease ( CD). We examined whether social support is associated with distress and disease activity. There were 110 UC and 147 CD patients who completed sociodemography , economic status , disease activity ( UC: Patient Simple Clinical Colitis<disease> Activity Index ( P-SCCAI) , CD: Patient Harvey-Bradshaw Index. ( P-HBI) , Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support ( MSPSS) , Brief Symptom Inventory with Global Severity Index ( GSI) of psychological distress , and 2 health-related quality-of-life scales ( SF-36 Physical Health and Mental Health , and Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( SIBDQ). Analysis included multiple linear regressions and structural equation modeling. Disease activity was mild: UC: P-SCCAI 2.9 ± 3.5 , CD: P-HBI 4.7 ± 4.7. Physical Health was better in UC 46.6 ± 11.4 versus CD 43.7 ± 10.9 ( P < .02). GSI was lower in UC 0.6 ± 0.7 than CD 0.8 ± 0.7 ( P = .002). MSPSS total score was equal in UC ( 5.9 ± 1.2) and CD ( 5.9 ± 1.1). MSPSS total correlated with P-SCCAI ( correlation coefficient 0.240) , GSI in UC ( 0.470) , and GSI in CD ( 0.333). Economic status correlated with GSI in UC ( 0.408) and CD ( 0.356). MSPSS predicted GSI , Mental Health , and SIBDQ in UC and CD , and predicted P-SCCAI but not P-HBI; economic status predicted all the foregoing. Path analysis depicted GSI as mediating the effects of MSPSS and economic status on disease activity in both UC and CD. MSPSS ( UC: β 0.34 , CD: β 0.37) and economic status ( UC: β 0.38 , CD: β 0.22) reduced GSI , which then increased the disease activity ( UC: β 0.56 , CD: β 0.42). Social support and economic status are linked to UC and CD patients ' well-being. Interventions addressing these issues should be part of management.
