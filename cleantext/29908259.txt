  To maintain a high level of specificity and normal cell function , the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP) pathway is tightly regulated in space and time. Recent advances in cAMP reporter technology have provided insights into spatio-temporal characteristics of cAMP signalling in individual living cells , including astrocytes. Astrocytes are glial cells in the central nervous system with many homeostatic functions. In contrast to neurons , astrocytes are electrically silent , but , in response to extracellular stimuli through activation of surface receptors , they can increase intracellular levels of secondary messengers , e.g. Ca
