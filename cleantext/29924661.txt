  The prevalence and cost of hip osteoarthritis ( OA) is rising. Mechanical diagnosis and therapy ( MDT) is an orthopedic classification and treatment system based on mechanical and symptomatic response to repeated and sustained end-range movements. There has been no investigation of the association between MDT and patients diagnosed with hip OA. This case report presents a 71-year-old female diagnosed with hip OA and matching the currently accepted clinical prediction rule ( CPR) for symptomatic hip OA. The patient was classified and treated by a Diplomat of MDT and co-examiner using MDT. Short- and long-term ( 13 months) outcomes were excellent , demonstrating rapid abolishment of symptoms and improvement in function in 5 visits over 21 days. The patient demonstrated the ability to prevent and manage reoccurrence of symptoms independently; nevertheless , she received a total hip replacement which was not in accordance with current guidelines and recommendations. This case report raises questions about whether or not pathologies traditionally associated with the etiology of hip OA are actually at fault. Moreover , it raises questions about the utility of special tests and CPRs typically utilized to identify those structures. The case report provides preliminary evidence from one patient that MDT may be capable of providing effective short- and long-term outcomes in the management of hip OA.
