  Timidity in dogs is a trait with high heritability. However , the relevant genetic factors and markers associated with this condition are largely unknown. The function of the catechol-O-methyl transferase ( COMT) gene has been found to be associated with human fearful or anxious emotions , and the COMT :p. Val158Met polymorphism locus is significantly related to anxious behavior. In the present study , the correlation between timidity and four single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) variations ( C.-1666C > G c. 39A > G , c. 216G > A , c. 482G > A) of the COMT gene was investigated in dogs. The evaluation was based on the dog courage assessment assay and a genotype and haplotype analysis in Labrador Retrievers ( LR) and Golden Retrievers ( GR). The principal components analysis factor structure of the courage phenotype was invariant between LR and GR. Sex , breed and age had no statistically significant effect on the timidity of the dogs. All SNP loci detected were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The c. 39A > G locus was removed in the subsequent association analysis due to the significant difference between LR and GR in genotype distributions. Intriguingly , the genotypes and haplotypes of the COMT gene were significantly and highly correlated with the timidity of LR and GR. The A alleles of the COMT: c. 216G > A and c. 482G > A loci appeared to play a dominant role in the timid behavior of the dogs. This result supports and broadens the warrior/worrier hypothesis and will have important implications for the understanding of the evolution of temperament in dogs. Additionally , the results provide predictive genetic markers for temperament in dogs.
