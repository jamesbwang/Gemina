  This study was conducted to determine the effect of high- and low-activity xylanase in a corn and soybean diet on the performance of laying hens. There were 2 phases each with 4 treatment diets: positive control ( PC) , negative control ( NC) with lower metabolizable energy ( ME) and nutrient density , and 2 different xylanases supplemented to the NC diet. Phase 1 was 23-43 wk of age and phase 2 was 43-58 wk , for a total duration of 35 wk. The NC diet had a lower ME in phase 2 than phase 1. There were 72 cages with 3 Bovan White Leghorns each. Egg production ( EP) was recorded daily , feed intake ( FI) weekly , and average egg weights ( EW) biweekly. Egg production and FI were calculated using biweekly periods , also used to determine egg mass ( EM) and feed conversion ( FC) with biweekly EW. BW was recorded and analyzed for weeks 0 , 10 , 20 , and 35 of the study. Egg production did not differ among treatment groups ( phase 1: P = 0.47; phase 2: P = 0.54). In phase 1 , EW and EM were significantly lower in the NC diet with enzyme B , compared to both the PC and NC diets ( P = 0.019; P = 0.01). The PC diet yielded higher EW than all other treatments in phase 2 ( P = 0.036) , but no differences in EM were present ( P = 0.12). Baseline BW was not different ( P = 0.63) , but hens fed the PC diet had higher BW in subsequent measurements ( P â‰¤ 0.05). Hens fed the PC diet had lower FI than all other treatment groups in both phases ( P = 0.0001) , and had an improved FC than the 2 enzyme groups in phase 1 ( P = 0.0001) and all other treatment groups in phase 2 ( P = 0.0001). The enzymes did not improve the performance of the birds.
