  The current study aimed to evaluate if the addition of pentoses along with variations in light intensity and photoperiod can stimulate the production of polyhydroxybutyrate ( PHB) and other biomolecules by Chlorella fusca<pathogen> LEB 111. The variables evaluated were the addition of xylose and arabinose as sources of organic carbon , different photoperiods ( 18 h , 12 h and 6 h light) and variations in light intensities ( 58 , 28 and 9 Î¼mol
