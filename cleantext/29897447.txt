  In striated muscle , the giant protein titin spans the entire length of a half-sarcomere and extends from the backbone of the thick filament , reversibly attaches to the thin filaments , and anchors to the dense protein network of the z-disk capping the end of the half-sarcomere. However , little is known about the relationship between the basic mechanical properties of titin and muscle contractility. Here , we build upon our previous multi-filament , spatially explicit computational model of the half-sarcomere by incorporating the nonlinear mechanics of titin filaments in the I-band. We vary parameters of the nonlinearity to understand the effects of titin stiffness on contraction dynamics and efficiency. We do so by simulating isometric contraction for a range of sarcomere lengths ( SL; 1.6-3.25 μm). Intermediate values of titin stiffness accurately reproduce the passive force-SL relation for skeletal muscle. The maximum force-SL relation is not affected by titin for SL ≤ 2.5 μm. However , as titin stiffness increases , maximum force for the four thick filament system at SL = 3.0 μm significantly decreases from 103.2 ± 2 pN to 58.8 ± 1 pN. Additionally , by monitoring ATP consumption , we measure contraction efficiency as a function of titin stiffness. We find that at SL = 3.0 μm , efficiency significantly decreases from 13.9 ± 0.4 pN/ATP to 7.0 ± 0.3 pN/ATP when increasing titin stiffness , with little or no effect below 2.5 μm. Taken together , our results suggest that , despite an increase in the fraction of motors<symptom> bound to actin along the descending limb when titin is stiffer , the force-generating capacity of the motors<symptom> is reduced. These results suggest that titin stiffness has the potential to affect contractile efficiency.
