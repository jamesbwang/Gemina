  To translate and linguistically and culturally adapt to Brazilian Portuguese , and verify the reliability and validity of the Radboud Oral Motor Inventory for Parkinson 's Disease ( ROMP). The ROMP was translated and retranslated , and the instrument reliability was verified by analyzing the internal consistency and the reproducibility of the intra-examiner retest. The final version was applied to 27 participants with Parkinson 's disease. Internal consistency was 0.99 for the total ROMP and 0.96 to 0.99 for the three domains. Intraclass correlation coefficients for reproducibility were 0.99 for the total ROMP and 0.93 to 0.99 for the subscales. The ROMP and its subscales correlated substantially with the Likert-type scale , as well as with the unified Parkinson 's disease rating scale II and III items. The linguistic and cultural equivalence of the ROMP in Brazilian Portuguese is now available , with excellent reliability and validity.
