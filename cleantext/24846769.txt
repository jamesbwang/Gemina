  Endotoxemia-induced inflammation<symptom> has been associated with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis , ultimately increasing the risk of coronary heart disease. Increased intestinal permeability is an important event leading to endotoxemia. This study aims to elucidate the possible association between endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide) and zonulin ( a biomarker of intestinal permeability) levels and the risk of coronary heart disease , and thus healthy aging. Serum levels of zonulin , lipopolysaccharide and soluble CD14 ( a protein that binds lipopolysaccharide) were measured in disease-free centenarians , young healthy controls and patients with precocious acute myocardial infarction. Disease-free centenarians had significantly lower levels of serum zonulin (
