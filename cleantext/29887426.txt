  Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> often occur concomitantly , representing a clinical phenotype at high-risk for poor outcomes. Differences in the characteristics , management , and in-hospital outcomes of AF among those with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF) and those with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF) are not well characterized. Using the National Inpatient Sample , we identified hospitalizations in 2008-2012 for HFpEF and for HFrEF , with and without AF based on ICD-9-CM codes. We examined patient characteristics , procedural rates , and in-hospital outcomes. AF was common among both HFpEF and HFrEF , and increased in prevalence over the study period. A very low proportion of the cohort underwent either direct-current cardioversion or catheter-ablation. Compared to those without AF , those with AF experienced higher in-hospital mortality regardless of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> subtype. In multivariable regression analysis , AF was associated with in-hospital mortality in HFpEF ( OR 1.10 , CI ( 1.08-1.11)) , but not in HFrEF ( OR 0.93 ( 0.92-0.94) , p-for-interaction < 0.001). Our study revealed that the prevalence and adverse impact of AF on those with HFpEF is substantial , providing a rationale to rigorously investigate strategies , such as rhythm-control , to improve outcomes for this particularly vulnerable subpopulation.
