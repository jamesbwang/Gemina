  Negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus ( NSRV) is featured by their ribonucleoprotein ( RNP) complex<pathogen> composed by viral polymerase and genomic RNA enwrapped by nucleocapsid protein ( NP). The RNP is packaged in virions and plays a central role throughout virus lifecycle. In the past decade , structural biology presents molecular insights into NPs encoded by most representative NSRVs , helping to understand the mechanism of RNP formation. Interestingly , works initiated from structural biology also reveal unexpected biological functions of virus NP beyond a structural protein. All these further the knowledge of virus NP and provide great potential for the discovery of antiviral agents to target virus RNP formation. In this chapter , we will summarize the structures and functions of viral NPs , as well as the attempt of NP-targeted antiviral development.
