  Five stable clusters sharing the cuboidal ( Ni4O4) skeleton are subjected to third-order nonlinear optical ( NLO) property measurements. Preliminary results suggest that the NLO property is largely defined by the cluster core skeleton and the directly coordinated atoms , with limited contribution from the heavy atoms peripherally attached to the aromatic ligands.
