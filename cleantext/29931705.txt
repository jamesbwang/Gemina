  In 2014 , the state of Maryland moved away from fee-for-service payments and into a global budget revenue ( GBR) structure where hospitals have a fixed revenue target , independent of patient volume or services provided. We assess the effects of GBR adoption on emergency department ( ED) admission decisions among adult encounters. We used hospital medical record and billing data from adult ED encounters from January 1 , 2011 through December 31 , 2015 , with four Maryland ( MD) hospitals and two District of Columbia ( DC) hospitals within the same health system. We performed difference-in-differences analysis ( DID) and calculated the effects of the GBR model on ED admission rates ( inpatient and observation) using hospital-fixed effect regression adjusted for patient , hospital , and community factors. We also examined changes in the distribution of acuity among ED admissions with GBR adoption. The study sample included 1,492,953 ED encounters with a mean ED admission rate of 20.5 %. The ED admission rate difference pre- and post-GBR was -1.14 % ( 95 % CI: -0.89 , -1.40) for MD hospitals and -0.04 % ( 95 % CI: -0.24 , 0.32) for DC hospitals with a DID of -1.10 % ( 95 % CI: -1.34 , -0.86). This change was attributable to a -3.3 % ( 95 % CI: -3.54 , -3.08) decline in inpatient admissions and 2.7 % ( 95 % CI: 2.53 , 2.79) increase in observation admissions. Declines in admissions were observed primarily among mild-to-moderate severity of illness encounters with a low risk of mortality. Within the same health system , implementation of global budgeting in MD hospitals was associated with a decline in ED admissions- particularly lower acuity admissions- compared to DC hospitals that remained under fee-for-service payments.
