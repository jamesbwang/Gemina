  The over discharge of mine tailing cause consequent heavy metal pollution. Phytoremediation as one of the most viable and efficient method for this problem has aroused much attention. In this research , the growth and physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> of Suaeda glauca and Arabidopsis thaliana plants were investigated , and the soil conditions ( pH and enzyme activity) were evaluated further under varied levels of cadmium ( Cd) , lead ( Pb) and manganese ( Mn). The results showed that heavy metals could inhibit the growth of plants. The fresh weight and photosynthetic pigments contents of Suaeda and Arabidopsis decreased with the increased concentration of Cd , Pb and Mn. As a monitoring plant , growth status of Arabidopsis showed good dose-effect when treated by heavy metals. S. glauca showed better tolerance capacity for Cd , Pb and Mn , when compared with Arabidopsis. Moreover , the physical and chemical properties of soil were significantly improved after phytoremediation. The soil catalase activity decreased with increased concentration of metal treatments , which showed similar regularity with microbial community. Changes of microbial community could not only indicate the soil environment but also suggest that S. glauca plants had better influences on the soil microbial environment. The introduction of plants resulted in a 0.5-0.8 units change in soil pH compared with the initial pH level. The present study provided the potential of S. glauca plants for phytoremediation in contaminated soil. Microbial community of Suaeda and Arabidopsis were evaluated and showed different regularity because of the rhizosphere effect. Soil microorganisms played an important role in the process of bioremediation. Meantime the main problems about physical and chemical properties of mine tailings were improved. It could be of great significance to the large-scale resource utilization and economical remediation of mine tailings.
