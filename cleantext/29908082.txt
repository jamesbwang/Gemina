  We previously showed that female rats are more protected against renal ischaemia/reperfusion ( I/R) injury than males , which is partly attributed to their more pronounced heat shock<symptom> response. We recently described that Sigma-1 receptor ( S1R) activation improves postischaemic survival and renal function. 17β-estradiol activates S1R , thus here we investigated the role of sex-specific S1R activation and heat shock<symptom> response in severe renal I/R injury. Proximal tubular cells were treated with 17β-estradiol , which caused direct S1R activation and subsequent induction of heat shock<symptom> response. Uninephrectomized female , male and ovariectomized female ( Ovx) Wistar rats were subjected to 50-min renal ischaemia followed by 2 ( T2) and 24 ( T24) hours of reperfusion. At T24 renal functional , impairment was less severe and structural damage was less prominent in females versus males or Ovx. Postischaemic increase in S1R , pAkt , HSF-1 , HSP72 levels were detected as early as at T2 , while pHSP27 was elevated later at T24. Abundance of heat shock<symptom> proteins was higher in healthy female rats and remained higher at T2 and T24 ( female versus male or Ovx; resp.). We propose a S1R-dependent mechanism , which contributes to the relative renoprotection of females after I/R injury by enhancing the heat shock<symptom> response.
