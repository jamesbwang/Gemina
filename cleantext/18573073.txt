  Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ( FGFR2) play a vital role in skeletogenesis. However , the molecular mechanisms triggered by FGFR2 in osteoblasts are still not fully understood. In this study , proteomics and bioinformatics analysis were performed to investigate changes in the protein profiles regulated by FGFR2 , with the goal of characterizing the molecular mechanisms of FGFR2 function in osteoblasts. In this study , FGFR2-overexpression cell line was established using the lentivirus-packaging vector in human osteoblasts ( hFOB1 .19). Next , the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation ( iTRAQ) in combination with the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) method was used to compare the proteomic changes between control and FGFR2-overexpression cells. Thresholds ( fold-change of â‰¥ 1.5 and a A Total of 149 DEPs was identified. The DEPs mainly located within organelles and involved in protein binding and extracellular regulation of signal transduction. ColI<pathogen> , TNC , FN1 and CDKN1A were strikingly downregulated while UBE2E3 , ADNP2 and HSP70 were significantly upregulated in FGFR2-overexpression cells. KEEG analysis suggested the key pathways included cell death , PI3K-Akt signaling , focal adhesion and cell cycle. To our knowledge , this is the first protomic research to investigate alterations in protein levels and affected pathways in FGFR2-overexpression osteoblasts. Thus , this study not only provides a comprehensive dataset on overall protein changes regulated by FGFR2 , but also shed light on its potential molecular mechanism in human osteoblasts.
