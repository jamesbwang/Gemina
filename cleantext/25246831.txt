  The role of human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) in the development of invasive cervical cancers is widely known. Few HPV<pathogen> studies have targeted geographically isolated regions. The objective of this study was to determine the HPV<pathogen> genotypes in cervical cancer patients from the Pacific Islands referred to Tripler Army Medical Center ( TAMC). All cases of invasive cervical cancer treated at TAMC through the Pacific Island Health Care Project between January 2004 and October 2014 were identified through a review of pathology specimens. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. PCR was performed using PLEX-ID plates to isolate and amplify HPV-specific DNA. Mass spectrometry was subsequently performed to identify specific HPV<pathogen> genotypes. Thirty-five patients had their pathology specimens analyzed. Ten patients had localized disease ( Stage 1); 21 had regional disease ( Stages 2 and 3); and 4 had distant disease ( Stage 4). Thirty-three squamous cell carcinomas and 3 adenocarcinomas were identified. The most common HPV<pathogen> subtypes found were 16 ( 6 , 24 %) , 45 ( 6 , 24 %) , and 52 ( 6 , 24 %). Other HPV<pathogen> subtypes isolated included 18 ( 1 , 4 %) , 33 ( 3 , 12 %) , 39 ( 2 , 8 %) , 54 ( 1 , 4 %) , and 67 ( 1 , 4 %). In 10 samples , HPV<pathogen> was not isolated. Pacific Islanders referred to TAMC present with a disproportionally higher rate of regional and advanced disease. Significantly , only 28 % of invasive cervical cancers in the Pacific Island population sampled could have been potentially be prevented using the available quadrivalent vaccine targeting HPV<pathogen> 16/18; however , 88 % could be covered by the recently licensed nonavalent vaccine.
