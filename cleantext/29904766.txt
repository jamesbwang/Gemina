  Linalool dehydratase/isomerase ( LinD) from Castellaniella defragrans is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the hydration of β-myrcene to ( S)- linalool and the isomerization of ( S)- linalool to geraniol. In this paper , on the basis of recently obtained crystal structures , the catalytic mechanism of LinD has been explored by a combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics ( QM/MM) approach. Two computational models have been constructed. Model I ( LinD-linalool) was derived from the crystal structure of the selenomethionine derivative of LinD ( Semet-LinD) in complex with the natural substrate geraniol , whereas model II ( LinD-β-myrcene) was constructed from the crystal structure of LinD in complex with β-myrcene. In addition to a minor conformational difference of the active sites , the two models also differ in the protonation state of key residues. In model I , the pocket residue Asp39 ' was set to be deprotonated and His129 was protonated on ND1 , whereas in model II , Asp38 ' was set to be deprotonated and His128 was protonated on NE2. Our calculations reveal model II as the active one , which implies that hydration and dehydration<symptom> are sensitive to the protonation state and fine structure of the active site. On the basis of model II , the conversion details from β-myrcene to geraniol can be obtained. Firstly , β-myrcene is hydrated by a crystal water ( W14) and is converted into the stable intermediate ( S)- linalool , then linalool is isomerized to geraniol with an overall energy barrier of 24.6 kcal mol-1. Besides , linalool can also reversibly convert into the reactant with an energy barrier of 24.1 kcal mol-1. It is also found that the intermediate IM1 can directly transform to geraniol without first converting to ( S)- linalool. His128 and Tyr65 form hydrogen bonds to stabilize the structure of the active site , but they do not act as general acid/base catalysts during the catalytic reactions.
