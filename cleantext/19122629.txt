  The present study aimed to identify a high-risk population with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) and to predict TNM stages using the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR). This retrospective study included preoperative data of 171 patients and 105 controls. Compared with healthy controls , patients with NSCLC had higher levels of NLR and PLR ( NLR , 2.719 ± 0.183 vs. 1.813 ± 0.079 , P < 0.01; PLR , 135.800 ± 4.778 vs. 112.000 ± 5.651 , P < 0.01 , respectively). The associations between Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages and the aforementioned parameters were detected ( both P < 0.01). NLR and PLR improved the rate of early diagnosis of NSCLC , particularly for stages III and IV with a higher area under curve value ( 0.752 and 0.759 , respectively) compared with stage I and II NSCLC. In addition , PLR with a T stage-dependent increase may be a potential and independent predictive marker for T stage ( P < 0.05); the NLR exhibited an N stage-dependent increase ( except for stage N3) and was identified as a marker for N stage ( P < 0.0001). It was subsequently concluded that NLR and PLR are useful biomarkers in the early diagnosis of NSCLC; that these two parameters were capable of indicating advanced stages , III and IV; and that PLR and NLR were independent predictors for T and N stages , respectively.
