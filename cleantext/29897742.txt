  Sepantronium bromide ( YM155) is a small molecule antitumor agent currently in phase II clinical trials. Although developed as survivin suppressor , YM155 's primary mode of action has recently been found to be DNA damage. However , the mechanism of DNA damage by YM155 is still unknown. Knowing the mechanism of action of an anticancer drug is necessary to formulate a rational drug combination and select a cancer type for achieving maximum clinical efficacy. Using cell-based assays , we showed that YM155 causes extensive DNA cleavage and reactive oxygen species generation. DNA cleavage by YM155 was found to be inhibited by radical scavengers and desferal. The reducing agent DTT and the cellular reducing system xanthine/xanthine oxidase were found to reductively activate YM155 and cause DNA cleavage. Unlike quinones , DNA cleavage by YM155 occurs in the presence of catalase and under hypoxic conditions , indicating that hydrogen peroxide and oxygen are not necessary. Although YM155 is a quinone , it does not follow a typical quinone mechanism. Consistent with these observations , a mechanism has been proposed that suggests that YM155 can cause oxidative DNA cleavage upon 2-electron reductive activation.
