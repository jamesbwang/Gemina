  We hypothesised that progression of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes mellitus differs among races/ethnicities in at-risk individuals. In this study , we analysed the data from the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study. We studied 4873 non-diabetic , autoantibody-positive relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes followed prospectively ( 11 % Hispanic , 80.9 % non-Hispanic white ( NHW) , 2.9 % non-Hispanic black ( NHB) and 5.2 % non-Hispanic other ( NHO)). Primary outcomes were time from single autoantibody positivity confirmation to multiple autoantibody positivity , and time from multiple autoantibody positivity to type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis. Conversion from single to multiple autoantibody positivity was less common in Hispanic individuals than in NHW individuals ( HR 0.66 ( 95 % CI 0.46 , 0.96) , p = 0.028) adjusting for autoantibody type , age , sex , Diabetes Prevention Trial Type 1 Risk Score and HLA-DR3-DQ2/ DR4-DQ8 genotype. In participants who screened positive for multiple autoantibodies ( n = 2834) , time to type 1 diabetes did not differ by race/ethnicity overall ( p = 0.91). In children who were < 12 years old when multiple autoantibody positivity was determined , being overweight/obese had differential effects by ethnicity: type 1 diabetes risk was increased by 36 % in NHW children ( HR 1.36 ( 95 % CI 1.04 , 1.77) , p = 0.024) and was nearly quadrupled in Hispanic children ( HR 3.8 ( 95 % CI 1.6 , 9.1) , p = 0.0026). We did not observe this interaction in participants who were â‰¥ 12 years old at determination of autoantibody positivity , although this group size was limited. No significant differential risks were observed between individuals of NHB and NHW ethnicity. The risk and rate of progression of islet autoimmunity were lower in Hispanic compared with NHW at-risk individuals , while significant differences in the development of type 1 diabetes were limited to children < 12 years old and were modified by BMI.
