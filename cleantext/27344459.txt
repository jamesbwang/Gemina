  In excitable tissues , the endogenous dipeptide carnosine ( CAR , & beta;- Ala-l-His) sustains homeostatic responses to various challenges. By eliciting hypoglycemic effects via actions on the autonomic nervous system and protection of pancreatic beta-cells , CAR is also relevant in diabetes. We investigated the expression of genes involved in CAR biosynthesis , degradation , and membrane transport pathways , in the pancreas and brains of mice treated with streptozotocin ( STZ) and then exposed to dietary CAR. We induced hyperglycemia by STZ intraperitoneal injections; then , STZ-treated mice received drinking water with or without CAR for two weeks. We report that CAR administration elicits beneficial effects on blood glucose levels and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> in STZ-treated mice and , remarkably , on the insulin gene products in the pancreas , preserving gene expression from STZ challenge. Also , we describe mRNA downregulation of the
