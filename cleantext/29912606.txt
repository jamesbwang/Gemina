  The use of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) is advantageous in in-vivo receptor occupancy assays at pre-clinical drug developmental stages. Relatively , its application is effective in terms of high throughput , data reproducibility , sensitivity , and sample processing. In this perspective , we have evaluated the use of FTC-146 as a non-radiolabelled tracer to determine the sigma-1 receptor occupancy of test drugs in mice brain. Further , the brain and plasma exposures of test drug were determined at their corresponding occupancies. In this occupancy method , the optimized tracer treatment ( sacrification) time after intravenous administration was 30 min. The tracer dose was 3 Âµg/kg and specific brain regions of interest were frontal cortex , pons and midbrain. Mice were pretreated orally with SA4503 , fluspidine , haloperidol , and donepezil followed by tracer treatment. Among the test drugs , SA4503 was used as positive control group at its highest test dose ( 7 mg/kg , intraperitoneal). There was a dose-dependent decrease in brain regional FTC-146 binding in pretreated mice. From the occupancy curves of SA4503 , fluspidine , haloperidol , and donepezil the effective dose ( ED
