  High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements ( double-/ triple-hit lymphoma) has an aggressive clinical course. We investigated prognostic value of transformation from low-grade lymphoma , cytologic features ( high grade versus large cell) , MYC gene rearrangement partners ( immunoglobulin versus nonimmunoglobulin gene) , and treatment. We evaluated 100 adults with double-/ triple-hit lymphoma , reviewing cytologic features; cell of origin; and rearrangements of MYC , BCL2 , and BCL6 using MYC , BCL2 , and BCL6 break-apart and IGH/MYC , IGL/MYC , IGK/MYC , and IGH/BCL2 dual-fusion interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization probes. Outcome analysis was restricted to patients , de novo or at transformation , who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Among them , 60 % had high-grade cytologic features; 91 % , germinal center B-cell phenotype , and 60 % , MYC/immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. Germinal center B-cell phenotype was associated with BCL2 rearrangements ( P < .001). Mean ( 95 % CI) 5-year overall survival was 49 % ( 37 % -64 %). Transformation from previously treated and untreated low-grade lymphoma was associated with inferior overall survival ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 2.99; P = .008). Patients with high-grade cytologic features showed a nonsignificant tendency for inferior outcome ( HR , 2.32; P = .09). No association was observed between MYC rearrangement partner and overall survival ( HR , 1.00; P = .99). Compared with patients receiving rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , and vincristine ( R-CHOP) and dose-adjusted etoposide , prednisone , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , and rituximab ( EPOCH-R) , patients receiving rituximab , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , methotrexate/ifosfamide , etoposide , and cytarabine ( R-CODOX-M/IVAC) had a nonsignificant tendency for better overall survival ( HR , 0.37; P = .10). In conclusion , high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements had heterogeneous outcomes and MYC/immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were not associated with inferior overall survival.
