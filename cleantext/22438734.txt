  This work looks at the exploitation of large numbers of orthogonal redundant inertial measurement units. Specifically , the paper analyses centralized and distributed architectures in the context of data fusion algorithms for those sensors. For both architectures , data fusion algorithms based on Kalman filter are developed. Some of those algorithms consider sensors location , whereas the others do not , but all estimate the sensors bias. A fault detection algorithm , based on residual analysis , is also proposed. Monte-Carlo simulations show better performance for the centralized architecture with an algorithm considering sensors location. Due to a better estimation of the sensors bias , the latter provides the most precise and accurate estimates and the best fault detection. However , it requires a much longer computational time. An analysis of the sensors bias correlation is also done. Based on the simulations , the biases correlation has a small effect on the attitude rate estimation , but a very significant one on the acceleration estimation.
