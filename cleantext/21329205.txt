  Below the seafloor at deep-sea hot springs , mixing of geothermal fluids with seawater supports a potentially vast microbial ecosystem. Although the identity of subseafloor microorganisms is largely known , their effect on deep-ocean biogeochemical cycles can not be predicted without quantitative measurements of their metabolic rates and growth efficiency. Here , we report on incubations of subseafloor fluids under in situ conditions that quantitatively constrain subseafloor primary productivity , biomass standing stock , and turnover time. Single-cell-based activity measurements and 16S rRNA-gene analysis showed that
