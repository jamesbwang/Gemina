  In a community-academic partnership , we implemented a group-based model for well-child care ( CenteringParenting) and conducted a pilot test for feasibility and acceptability among families at a federally-qualified health center ( FQHC). The FQHC implemented CenteringParenting for all well-child care ( WCC) visits in the first year of life , starting at the 2-week visit. Over a 14-month time period , parents from each new CenteringParenting group were enrolled into the study. Baseline data were collected at enrollment ( infant age < 31 days) , and again at a 6-month follow-up survey. Main outcomes were feasibility and acceptability of CenteringParenting; we also collected exploratory measures ( parent experiences of care , utilization , self-efficacy and social support). Forty parent-infant dyads were enrolled in the pilot; 28 CenteringParenting participants completed the 6-month follow-up assessment. The majority of infants were Latino , black , or `` other '' race/ethnicity; over 90 % were Medicaid insured. Of 28 CenteringParenting participants who completed the 6-month follow-up , 25 completed all visits between ages 2 weeks through 6 months in the CenteringParenting group. 97 % -100 % of CenteringParenting participants reported having adequate time with their provider , patient education , and having their needs met at visits; the majority reported feeling comfortable at the group visit , and all reported wanting to continue CenteringParenting for their WCC. CenteringParenting participants ' mean scores on exploratory measures demonstrated positive experiences of care , overall satisfaction of care , confidence in parenting , and parental social support. A community-academic partnership implemented CenteringParenting; the intervention was acceptable and feasible for a minority , low-income population. We highlight key challenges of implementation.
