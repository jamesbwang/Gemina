  In a fusion of two ubiquitous organometallic reagents , triphenylphosphine ( PPh3) and tetraphenylborate ( BPh4-) , the 9-phosphatriptycene-10-phenylborate ( PTB) anion has been prepared for the first time. This borato species has been fully characterized by a suite of spectroscopic methods , and initial reactivity studies introduce it as a competent ligand for transition metals , including Co ( ii) and Fe ( ii).
