  Obesity is pandemic. Yet , the success of most weight<symptom> loss<symptom> programmes is poor. The aim of the study was to assess illness perception in overweight/obese people and its impact on bio-functional age ( BFA) reflecting physical , mental , emotional and social functioning. 75 overweight/obese subjects from the cross-sectional Bern Cohort Study 2014 were included. Participants followed a validated `` bio-functional status '' test battery amended by the validated questionnaires Patiententheoriefragebogen ( illness perception) and AD-EVA ( eating and movement behaviour). BFA was calculated in subjects aged ≥ 35 years ( n = 56). ( 1) Mental occupation with the cause of overweight/obesity was generally moderate to high , but decreasing with age. ( 2) The predominant theories for being overweight/obese were health behaviour ( 58.7 %) and psychosocial factors ( 33.3 %). ( 3) Overweight/obese people with psychosocial theories on illness causes were more likely to have emotional or disinhibited eating patterns. ( 4) Cognitive control of eating patterns increased with age in both sexes. ( 5) Overweight/obese people were still bio-functionally younger than their chronological age ( 8.6 ± 0.8 year equivalents) , although ( 6) quality of life was below average and ( 7) the risk for functional pro-aging was increased in those being especially mentally occupied with causes for overweight/obesity ( r = 0.38 , p < 0.001) and those having psychosocial ( r = 0.32 , p < 0.05) or naturalistic theories ( r = 0.47 , p > 0.001). Consciously perceived psychosocial stress was found to be a main factor to disturb health and promote unhealthy cognitive patterns regulating eating and moving habits. Thus , successful weight reduction programmes should integrate subjective illness perceptions to not only improve the therapeutic outcome , but also functioning ( BFA).
