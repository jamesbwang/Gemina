  Secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT) and calcium and phosphorus metabolism disorder are important complications in haemodialysis patients. Parathyroidectomy ( PTX) may prevent or delay the progress of vascular calcification in haemodialysis patients. To investigate the impacts of PTX on calcium and phosphorus metabolism , arterial calcification and arterial stiffness in haemodialysis patients with SHPT. Twenty-one SHPT-haemodialysis patients were selected for PTX. The preoperative and postoperative 1-year scores of coronary artery calcification were measured via multislice spiral CT , along with the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity ( baPWV) , and preoperative and postoperative 1-year indexes such as calcium , phosphorus , calcium-phosphorus product concentration and parathyroid hormone ( PTH) level were compared. Compared with the preoperative score , the postoperative 1-year coronary artery calcification score was significantly reduced; the mean baPWVs of the bilateral limbs were reduced; and the levels of serum calcium , phosphorus , calcium-phosphorus product concentration and PTH were all reduced; all differences were statistically significant ( P < 0.05). PTX can be used to correct calcium and phosphorus metabolism disorder , reduce arterial calcification , and improve arterial stiffness.
