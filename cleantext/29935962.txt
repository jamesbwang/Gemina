  We report on a 4-year-old girl with a de novo GNAO1 mutation who had neurological findings , including decreased spontaneous<symptom> movements<symptom> , hypotonia , and dystonic features. She was referred to our hospital because of delayed psychomotor development. She showed hypotonia and decreased spontaneous<symptom> movements<symptom>. Voluntary movements of the limbs were more frequent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. Occasional dyskinetic features , such as awkward hand/foot posturing and grimacing , were seen during the voluntary movements. Serum metabolic screening , head magnetic resonance imaging , and electroencephalography were unremarkable. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a de novo mutation in the patient 's GNAO1 gene , c. 709 G > A ( p.E237K). We calculated the free-energy change using the FoldX Suite to evaluate the impact of the E237K mutation. The FoldX calculations showed an increased free-energy change in the active state of the GNAO1 protein , indicating that the E237K mutation destabilizes the active state complexes. No seizures<symptom> , chorea , tremor<symptom> , or myoclonia , which are frequently reported in patients with GNAO1 mutations , were observed as of the last follow up. Our patient will improve the understanding of early neurological features in patients with GNAO1 mutations.
