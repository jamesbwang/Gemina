  Endogenous antibodies to signaling molecules and receptors ( Abs) are associated with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). To investigate the association of 33 Abs to dopaminergic , serotoninergic , muscarinic , adrenergic , vascular , and immune receptors with cognitive , neuropsychiatric , and mortality outcomes. Ninety-one patients with mild AD were followed annually for 5 years with the Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI; composite outcomes: `` psychosis '' ( item 1 + 2) , `` mood '' ( item 4 + 5 + 7) , and `` agitation '' ( item 3 + 8 + 9)). Abs were quantified in sera obtained at baseline by ELISA and reduced to principal components ( PCs). Associations between Abs and outcomes were assessed by a mixed model ( MMSE decline) , zero-inflated fixed effects count models ( composite NPI scores) , and Cox regression ( mortality). The resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple testing according to a false discovery rate of 0.05 ( Benjamini-Hochberg). The measured levels of the 33 Abs formed four PCs. PC1 ( dopaminergic and serotonergic Abs) was associated with increased mortality ( Hazard ratio 2.57 , p < 0.001) , PC2 ( serotonergic , immune , and vascular Abs) with decreased agitation symptoms ( β- 0.19 , p < 0.001) , and PC3 ( cholinergic receptor Abs) with increased mood symptoms ( β 0.04 , p = 0.002) , over time. There were no associations between Abs and MMSE decline. The associations between Abs , mortality , and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported in this cohort are intriguing. They can not , however , be generalized. Validation in independent sample sets is required.
