  Synthetic polyelectrolytes , capable of fast transporting protons , represent a challenging target for membrane engineering in so many fields , for example , fuel cells , redox flow batteries , etc.. Inspired by the fast advance in molecular machines , here we report a rotaxane based polymer entity assembled via host-guest interaction and prove that by exploiting the thermally triggered translational motion ( although not in a controlled manner) of mechanically bonded rotaxane , exceptionally fast proton transfer can be fulfilled at an external thermal input. The relative motion of the sulfonated axle to the ring in rotaxane happens at ~ 60 Â°C in our cases and because of that a proton conductivity ( indicating proton transfer rate) of 260.2 mS cm
