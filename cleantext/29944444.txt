  AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 ( ARF3) , one of the auxin response factors family of transcription factors , is well characterized by its functions in polarity identification and organ patterning. We recently demonstrated that ARF3 plays important roles in floral meristem ( FM) maintenance and termination by regulating cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling. However , the relationship of its multiple roles in differently developmental stage is still unclear. Here , we present data that ARF3 plays distinct roles during early flower development that are different from its roles in organ polarity determination and pattering. Thus , our findings shed light on the functional diversity of one specific transcription factor in plant development.
