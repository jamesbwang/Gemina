  Political bodies and professional societies acknowledge that translational research benefits from researchers trained in both , clinical medicine and basic science. Yet , few physicians undergoing clinical training in cardiology seek this dual career ( Milewicz et al.. J Clin Invest 125:3742-3747 , 2015). The reasons are likely manifold , but with cardiology having become increasingly interventional and facing economic pressure , how much attention , credit , and encouragement is given to physicians interested in basic cardiovascular science? Having studied and worked in hospitals and laboratories , in both Germany and the USA , we aim to compare in this article how basic science education is currently integrated into cardiology training at German and US university hospitals , from medical school to more advanced career stages. By doing so , we hope to provide some outside perspectives to young physicians and decision makers alike , that may inspire changes to curricula in the respective countries and around the world.
