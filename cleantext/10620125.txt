  Alopecia areata ( AA) is a common dermatologic disease with suspected autoimmune etiology. Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor superfamily member 6 or CD95 ( FAS) and FAS ligand ( FASL) are proapoptotic proteins. The relationship between apoptosis and autoimmunity is well recognized. Inflammatory T cells in AA are cytotoxic and possess FAS/FASL antigens. This study aims to investigate the association between FAS-670 A/G and FASL-124 A/G gene polymorphisms and AA to clarify if these polymorphisms influence disease occurrence or increase disease risk. A case-control study was conducted on sixty patients with AA , and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects , as a control group. Disease severity was assessed by severity of alopecia tool ( SALT) Score. FAS 670A/G and FASL 124A/G gene polymorphisms were investigated by the restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. For FAS gene , G/G genotype was significantly higher in cases than in control group with odds ratio 5.1. G allele was more prevalent among patient group with odds ratio 1.75. For FASL gene , A/G genotype was significantly higher in cases than in control group with odds ratio 4.53. G allele was more prevalent among patient group with odds ratio 1.88. GG genotype of FAS was significantly associated with longer disease duration ( FAS and FASL gene polymorphisms are associated with AA. Further large-scale studies on different ethnicities are required for more clarification of their role in disease development. Therapeutic modalities based on their inhibition could be promising in the treatment of a common disease like AA.
