  The relationship between morphology and inheritance is of perennial interest in evolutionary biology and palaeontology. Using three marine snail genera Penion , Antarctoneptunea and Kelletia , we investigate whether systematics based on shell morphology accurately reflect evolutionary lineages indicated by molecular phylogenetics. Members of these gastropod genera have been a taxonomic challenge due to substantial variation in shell morphology , conservative radular and soft tissue morphology , few known ecological differences , and geographical overlap between numerous species. Sampling all sixteen putative taxa identified across the three genera , we infer mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal DNA phylogenetic relationships within the group , and compare this to variation in adult shell shape and size. Results of phylogenetic analysis indicate that each genus is monophyletic , although the status of some phylogenetically derived and likely more recently evolved taxa within Penion is uncertain. The recently described species P. lineatus is supported by genetic evidence. Morphology , captured using geometric morphometric analysis , distinguishes the genera and matches the molecular phylogeny , although using the same dataset , species and phylogenetic subclades are not identified with high accuracy. Overall , despite abundant variation , we find that shell morphology accurately reflects genus-level classification and the corresponding deep phylogenetic splits identified in this group of marine snails.
