  A low-cost and eco-friendly superabsorbent composite is prepared through the free-radical graft co-polymerization of wheat bran ( WB) , acrylic acid ( AA) and laterite ( LA) in an aqueous solution. Elemental map , scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that the LA evenly distributed in the superabsorbent composite and wheat bran-g-poly ( acrylic acid)/ laterite ( WB-g-PAA/LA) formed successfully. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that the WB-g-PAA/LA had high thermal stability. Furthermore , the properties of the WB-g-PAA/LA , such as swelling in saline solutions and degradation , are also assessed. The final WB-g-PAA/LA ( 5 wt %) superabsorbent composite attained an optimum water absorbency of 1425 g g
