  Cationic antimicrobial peptides ( CAMPs) are a promising alternative to treat multidrug-resistant bacteria , which have developed resistance to all the commonly used antimicrobial , and therefore represent a serious threat to human health. One of the major drawbacks of CAMPs is their sensitivity to proteases , which drastically limits their half-life. Here we describe the design and synthesis of three nine-residue CAMPs , which showed high stability in serum and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. As for all peptides a very low selectivity between bacterial and eukaryotic cells was observed , we performed a detailed biophysical characterization of the interaction of one of these peptides with liposomes mimicking bacterial and eukaryotic membranes<symptom>. Our results show a surface binding on the DPPC/DPPG vesicles , coupled with lipid domain formation , and , above a threshold concentration , a deep insertion into the bilayer hydrophobic core. On the contrary , mainly surface binding of the peptide on the DPPC bilayer was observed. These observed differences in the peptide interaction with the two model membranes<symptom> suggest a divergence in the mechanisms responsible for the antimicrobial activity and for the observed high toxicity toward mammalian cell lines. These results could represent an important contribution to unravel some open and unresolved issues in the development of synthetic CAMPs.
