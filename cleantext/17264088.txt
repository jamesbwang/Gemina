  To assess reliability of the two indexes of Localized Scleroderma Cutaneous Assessment Tool ( LoSCAT) , the modified Localized Scleroderma Skin Severity Index ( mLoSSI) and the Localized Scleroderma Skin Damage Index ( LoSDI) , when applied by clinicians with different experience in scoring and managing patients with JLS. Secondary aim was to compare LoSCAT and infrared thermography ( IRT) in monitoring lesions<symptom> over time. Consecutive children with Juvenile Localized Scleroderma ( JLS) were blindly evaluated by three examiners with different experience in Paediatric Rheumatology and with no experience in LoSCAT use. At each visit , patients were assessed by LoSCAT and IRT. Sensitivity to change of LoSCAT and IRT was assessed in a group of patients 3-6 months later. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient ( ICC) and variance analysis ( ANOVA). Forty-seven patients ( 129 lesions<symptom>) entered the study , and 26 ( 79 lesions<symptom>) were re-evaluated with same modality after 4.5 ( SD 1.5) months. mLoSSI showed excellent inter-rater reliability expressed by ICC 0.965 confirmed by ANOVA. Similarly , inter-rater reliability for LoSDI was good ( ICC = 0.774) but worse concordance among examiners was observed. A comparable improvement of mLoSSI in all anatomic sites was noted by all examiners in 79 lesions<symptom> examined in two subsequent visits and was consistent with thermography. Different clinical experience in JLS did not influence clinical judgement in mLoSSI which showed excellent concordance , whereas LoSDI is less precise in damage assessment and not completely reliable in monitoring skin<symptom> changes<symptom>. Infrared thermography confirms to be a helpful tool for detecting disease activity and reliable in monitoring lesions<symptom> over time.
