  Herein , we report the synthesis and molecular structure of the mono- and dianionic aromatic molecules ( ( B15C5-κ5O) 2K +) ( LDOPT˙-) ( 1) and ( ( B15C5-κ5O) 2K +) 2 ( LDOPT2-) THFsolv ( 2) derived from the parent aromatic polyhydrocarbon 5,6:11,12-di-o-phenylenetetracene ( DOPT , LDOPT) by a controlled stepwise one and two electron chemical reduction. The effect of single and double electron charge transfer to a polycondensed aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH) without any disturbing influence of an associated metal cation has been demonstrated. This was achieved by fully sandwiching the cationic K + counterions between two benzo-15-crown-5-ether ( B15C5) ligands resulting in a fully encapsulating ( κ10O) geometry which ensures a complete separation of the K + counterions and the bare anionic PAH species ( LDOPT˙-) and ( LDOPT2-). The structural changes accompanied by the stepwise reduction from LDOPT to ( LDOPT˙-) to ( LDOPT2-) are discussed and compared to earlier predictions based on density functional theory ( DFT) as well as the results of previous studies of alkaline metal cationic PAH anion interactions of DOPT in which only a partial metal cation encapsulation has been achieved so far.
