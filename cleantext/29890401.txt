  Food producing animals are considered a reservoir for Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamase ( AmpC) producing Enterobacteriaceae. Therefore , meat is discussed to be a potential source for the transmission of these resistant bacteria to humans. There is only limited information about the quantitative load of ESBL-/ AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae in different sample matrices during slaughter and their distribution in the slaughterhouse environment. Therefore , the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence as well as quantitative load of ESBL-/ AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae in caecum , skin and filet samples of different broiler chicken flocks during slaughter in Germany. In addition , environmental samples were taken during slaughter of the respective flocks. To gain insights into possible transmission routes of ESBL-/ AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae , the corresponding phylogroup and beta-lactamase genes were determined for selected isolates. ESBL-/ AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae were detected during slaughter of all seven investigated flocks. On average , 47 % ( 83/175) of caecum , 55 % ( 96/175) of skin , 28 % ( 49/175) of filet and 28 % ( 25/89) of environmental samples harboured ESBL-/ AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Prevalence varied widely between the flocks as well as between the different sample matrices. In about half of the caecum ( 23/40) and skin ( 19/40) samples as well as 85 % ( 17/20) of the filet samples , the number of putative ESBL-/ AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae ( cefotaxime resistant Enterobacteriaceae) was below quantification limit. The median of cefotaxime resistant Enterobacteriaceae was 2.5 Ã— 10
