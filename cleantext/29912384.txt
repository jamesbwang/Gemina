  Different hypotheses have been proposed in life course epidemiology on how a time-varying exposure can affect health or disease later in life. Researchers are often interested in investigating the probability of these hypotheses based on observed life course data. However , current techniques based on model/variable selection do not provide a direct estimate of this probability. We propose an alternative technique for a continuous exposure , using a Bayesian approach that has specific advantages , to investigate which life course hypotheses are supported by the observed data. We demonstrate the technique , the relevant life course exposure model ( RLM) , using simulations. We also analyse data from a case-control study on risk factors of oral cancer , with repeated measurements of betel quid chewing across life. We investigate the relative importance of chewing one quid of betel per day , at three life periods: â‰¤ 20 years , 21-40 years and above 40 years of age , on the risk of developing oral cancer. RLM was able to correctly identify the life course hypothesis under which the data were simulated. Results from the case-control study showed that there was 74.3 % probability that betel quid exposure earlier in life , compared with later , results in higher odds of developing oral cancer later in life. RLM is a useful option to identify the life course hypothesis supported by the observed data prior to the estimation of a causal effect.
