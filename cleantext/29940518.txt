  Innate responses are often sexually dimorphic. Studies of female specific behaviors have remained niche , but the focus is changing as illustrated by the recent progress in understanding the female courtship responses and egg-laying decisions. In this review , we will cover our current knowledge about female behaviors in these two specific contexts. Recent studies elucidate on how females process the courtship song. They also show that egg-laying decisions are extremely complex , requiring the assessment of food , microbial , predator and social cues. Study of female responses will improve our understanding of how a nervous system processes different challenges.
