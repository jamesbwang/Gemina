  The prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases such as diabetes , chronic kidney disease , obesity , cancer is increasing and comorbidity is more frequent in older age. The elderly patients with chronic degenerative diseases experience more acute complications and hospitalizations and poorer quality of life compared to elderly patients without chronic<disease> diseases<disease>.
