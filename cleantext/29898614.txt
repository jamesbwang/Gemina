  Media<pathogen> coverage of mental health and other social issues often relies on episodic narratives that suggest individualistic causes and solutions , while reinforcing negative stereotypes. Community narratives can provide empowering alternatives , serving as media advocacy tools used to shape the policy debate on a social issue. This article provides health promotion researchers and practitioners with guidance on how to develop and disseminate community narratives to broaden awareness of social issues and build support for particular programs and policy solutions. To exemplify the community narrative development process and highlight important considerations , this article examines a narrative from a mental health consumer-run organization. In the narrative , people with mental health problems help one another while operating a nonprofit organization , thereby countering stigmatizing media portrayals of people with mental illness as dangerous and incompetent. The community narrative frame supports the use of consumer-run organizations , which are not well-known and receive little funding despite evidence of effectiveness. The article concludes by reviewing challenges to disseminating community narratives , such as creating a product of interest to media outlets , and potential solutions , such as engaging media representatives through community health partnerships and using social media to draw attention to the narratives.
