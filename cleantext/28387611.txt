  This study was to analyze the outcomes of left subclavian artery ( LSA) revascularization during thoracic endovascular repair ( TEVAR) for type B aortic dissections ( TBAD). From 2011 to 2017 , TBAD patients who underwent LSA revascularization during TEVAR were enrolled. Technical success , endoleaks , mortality , complication , reintervention , and patency of target vessels were analyzed. 38 patients were included , 14 underwent carotid-subclavian bypass ( CSB) , and 24 underwent chimney graft ( CG) implantation. Technical success rates were 92.9 % and 100 % in CSB and CG group. Eleven immediate type I endoleak ( EL-I) was detected , including one from CSB group and ten from CG group. Three immediate type II endoleak ( EL-II) was detected in CSB group. Perioperative complications showed no difference , but CSB group had longer intensive care unit ( ICU) stay time. Median follow-up time was 26.2 months , and overall mortality was 14.3 % and 0 % in each group. Three EL-I and one EL-II underwent reintervention. All the LSA showed good patency , except one suffered from CG collapse. Both CSB and CG were feasible strategies to preserve the antegrade blood flow of LSA , and each strategy had its advantages and disadvantages. Based on our current experience , we preferred CG for high-risk patients. However , the evidence was still not strong enough , further well-designed studies are necessary to identify the criteria for LSA revascularization strategy during TEVAR.
