  Poncet disease is a rare , acute-onset polyarthritis associated with active extra-articular tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) without evidence of active infection in the affected joint and resolves without residual joint damage or long-term complications. Most cases are reported at the commencement of anti-tuberculous therapy ( ATT). A 13-year-old girl with Poncet disease is reported which , despite almost 6 months of treatment for abdominal TB , manifested with bilateral knee joint involvement which resolved only with continuation of ATT. A synovial biopsy was sterile.
