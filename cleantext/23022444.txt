  The photosynthetic quantum yield ( Φ) , defined as carbon fixed or oxygen evolved per unit of light absorbed , is a fundamental but rarely determined biophysical parameter. A method to estimate Φ for both net carbon uptake and net oxygen evolution simultaneously can provide important insights into energy and mass fluxes. Here we present details for a novel system that allows quantification of carbon fluxes using pH oscillation and simultaneous oxygen fluxes by integration with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer. The pHOS system was validated using Phaeodactylum tricornutum cultured with continuous illumination of 110 μmole quanta m-2 s-1 at 25 °C. Furthermore , simultaneous measurements of carbon and oxygen flux using the pHOS-MIMS and photon flux based on spectral absorption were carried out to explore the kinetics of Φ in P. tricornutum during its acclimation from low to high light ( 110 to 750 μmole quanta m-2 s-1). Comparing results at 0 and 24 hours , we observed strong decreases in cellular chlorophyll a ( 0.58 to 0.21 pg cell-1) , Fv/Fm ( 0.71 to 0.59) and maximum ΦCO2 ( 0.019 to 0.004) and ΦO2 ( 0.028 to 0.007) , confirming the transition toward high light acclimation. The Φ time-series indicated a non-synchronized acclimation response between carbon uptake and oxygen evolution , which has been previously inferred based on transcriptomic changes for a similar experimental design with the same diatom that lacked physiological data. The integrated pHOS-MIMS system can provide simultaneous carbon and oxygen measurements accurately , and at the time-resolution required to resolve high-resolution carbon and oxygen physiological dynamics.
