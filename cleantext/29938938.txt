  Seizures<symptom> during sleep increase the probability of complication and sudden death. Effective prediction of seizures<symptom> in sleep allows doctors and patients to take timely treatments to reduce the aforementioned probability. Most of the existing methods make use of electroencephalogram ( EEG) to predict seizures<symptom> , which are not specific developed for the sleep. However , EEG during sleep has its characteristics compared with EEG during other states. Therefore , in order to improve the sensitivity and reduce the false alarm rate , this paper utilized the characteristics of EEG to predict seizures<symptom> during sleep. We firstly constructed the feature vector including the absolute power spectrum , the relative power spectrum and the power spectrum ratio in different frequencies. Secondly , the separation criterion and branch-and-bound method were applied to select features. Finally , support vector machine classifier were trained , which is then employed for online prediction. Compared with the existing method that do not consider the characteristics of sleeping EEG ( sensitivity 91.67 % , false alarm rate 9.19 %) , the proposed method was superior in terms of sensitivity ( 100 %) and false alarm rate ( 2.11 %). This method can improve the existing epilepsy prediction methods and has important clinical value.
