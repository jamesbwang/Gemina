  The temperature dependence of the femtosecond elastic second harmonic scattering ( fs-ESHS) response of bulk light and heavy water and their electrolyte solutions is presented. We observe clear temperature dependent changes in the hydrogen ( H)- bond network of water that show a decrease in the orientational order of water with increasing temperature. Although D
