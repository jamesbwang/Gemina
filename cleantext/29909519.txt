  The effect of various feeding strategies was evaluated on growth performance and biochemical parameters in two sizes of Siberian sturgeon ( 465.75 ± 11.18 and 250.40 ± 12 g) during 45 days. Fish were distributed into six experimental treatments including large fish with satiation feeding ( LA) , small fish with satiation feeding ( SA) , large fish with 50 % satiation feeding ( LR) , small fish with 50 % satiation feeding ( SR) , large starved fish ( LS) , and small starved fish ( SS). Differences in final weight between LA and LR treatments were not noticeable , whereas SA and SR treatments showed significant differences. Growth parameters were more affected in small fish. In condition factor and weight gain in starved treatments , a considerable reduction occurred by interaction between feeding strategies and fish size , so the lowest values were obtained in SS treatment. Glucose levels significantly decreased in small fish during the starvation. Interaction between feeding strategy and fish size indicated the highest and lowest albumin level in SA and SS treatment , respectively. Cholesterol , triglyceride , total protein , and globulin showed no significant differences. It can be deduced that small fish are more sensitive to starvation than the large fish. Since glucose and albumin showed significant decrease in starved small fish , these parameters can help to monitor nutritional status and feeding practices. It was indicated that in both sizes of Siberian sturgeon , feeding 50 % satiation reduced the food cost without negative impact on physiological condition , and it can be considered as an appropriate strategy to face unfavorable circumstances.
