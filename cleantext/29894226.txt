  Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics is a powerful tool for gaining insights into function and dynamics of biological systems. However , peptides with different sequences have different ionization efficiencies , and their intensities in a mass spectrum are not correlated with their abundances. Therefore , various label-free or stable isotope label-based quantitation methods have emerged to assist mass spectrometry to perform comparative proteomic experiments , thus enabling nonbiased identification of thousands of proteins differentially expressed in healthy versus diseased cells. Here , we discuss the most widely used label-free and metabolic- , enzymatic- , and chemical labeling-based proteomic strategies for relative and absolute quantitation. We summarize the specific strengths and weaknesses<symptom> of each technique in terms of quantification accuracy , proteome coverage , multiplexing capability , and robustness. Applications of each strategy for solving specific biological complexities are also presented.
