  Emotional difficulties characterize eating disorders ( ED). We examined the construct of alexithymia ( disability to recognize and understand emotions) and neurocognitive factors of social cognition in patients diagnosed with B/P-EDs and their mothers. 34 mother-daughter dyads , in which the daughter has B/P-ED and 31 control dyads conducted subjective self-evaluation of alexithymia and underwent objective neuro-cognitive evaluation of their ability to recognize and understand emotions. Results were compared. First , significant differences were found between the daughters ' groups on their subjective but not objective evaluation of alexithymia. Second , within group motherdaughter correlation was positive for controls , but not for the ED group. People with B/P-ED show subjective high levels of alexithymia but not an objective deficit in emotional understanding. However , there is an interesting dis-correlation between them and their mothers , which calls for further research.
