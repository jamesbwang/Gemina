  The aim of this study was to evaluate the two rapid colorimetric methods ( CNPt-Direct and Blue-Carba) for the detection of carbapenemase production directly from blood culture in a routine microbiology laboratory. The methods were initially evaluated on spiked blood cultures with 61 carbapenemase-positive isolates. Afterwards they were used in blood cultures ( 314 samples were evaluated) obtained from patients in a routine microbiology laboratory , during a period of 6 months. The colorimetric methods were compared to the conventional culture of blood. The results of the spiked blood cultures indicated that both colorimetric methods presented positive results for the vast majority ( 95 %) of the isolates harbouring KPC , NDM and IMP genes. However , the assay failed to detect many GES and OXA-48-like positive isolates ( 65 % positive results). In the second part of the study a total of 314 blood cultures from patients were evaluated and 33 yielded
