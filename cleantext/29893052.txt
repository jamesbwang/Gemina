  More infants born extremely preterm ( EPT) are surviving , but major neonatal morbidities are consistently high. This study examined the impact of bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD) , brain injuries and severe retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP) on adolescents who were born EPT. We focused on EPT infants born at 23-25 weeks at the Swedish university hospitals in Uppsala and Ume√• from January 1992 to December 1998. The poor outcome data covered 140 of 142 who survived to 36 weeks , and the chronic conditions data reported by parents covered 132 of 134 still alive at 10-15 years. Of the 140 survivors at 36 weeks , 29 ( 21 %) had poor outcomes: eight of 140 ( 6 %) died , and 21 of 132 ( 16 %) adolescent survivors had severe neurodevelopmental disabilities ( NDD). BPD , severe ROP and/or brain injuries correlated independently with poor outcome. Of those adolescents who were free from BPD , brain injury and severe ROP , 6 % had a severe NDD. The corresponding rates with any one , any two or all three neonatal morbidities were 21 , 33 and 67 % , respectively. BPD and brain injuries were associated with high rates of chronic conditions at 10-15 years of age resulting in functional limitations. In adolescent EPT survivors , BPD and brain injuries were associated with high rates of chronic conditions and special healthcare needs.
