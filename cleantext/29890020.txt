  Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) regulates a variety of physiological processes , and several studies have explored the role of BDNF in addiction-related brain regions like the nucleus accumbens core ( NAcore). We sought to understand the rapid effects of endogenous BDNF on cocaine seeking. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine and extinguished. We then microinjected two inhibitors of BDNF stimulation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB) , the non-competitive receptor antagonist ANA-12 and TrkB/Fc , a fusion protein that binds BDNF and prevents TrkB stimulation. Blocking TrkB or inactivating BDNF in NAcore potentiated active lever pressing , showing that endogenous BDNF tone was present and supplying inhibitory tone on cue-induced reinstatement. To determine if exogenous BDNF also negatively regulated reinstatement , BDNF was microinjected into NAcore 15 minutes before cue-induced reinstatement. BDNF decreased cocaine seeking through TrkB receptor binding , but had no effect on inactive lever pressing , spontaneous or cocaine-induced locomotion , or on reinstated sucrose seeking. BDNF-infusion potentiated within trial extinction when microinjected in the NAcore during cue- and context + cue induced reinstatement , and the inhibition of lever pressing lasted at least 3 days post injection. Although decreased reinstatement endured for 3 days when BDNF was administered prior to a reinstatement session , when microinjected before an extinction session or in the home cage , BDNF did not alter subsequent cued-reinstatement. Together , these data show that endogenous BDNF acts on TrKB to provide inhibitory tone on reinstated cocaine seeking , and this effect was recapitulated by exogenous BDNF.
