  The aim of the present study was to assess the sensitivity of bio-impedance ( BIA) in tracking body composition changes in adolescents with various degrees of obesity. We hypothesized that while BIA provides a reliable measure of body composition , its accuracy decreases with increasing obesity and its ability to track changes might be reduced with higher degree of body<symptom> weight and body composition. Whole-body and segmental body composition were assessed by bio-impedance analysis ( BIA-Tanita MC-780) and dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA , Hologic) among 196 obese adolescents ( Tanner stage 3-5) aged 14 ± 0.9 years old , before and after a 3-month weight<symptom> loss<symptom> program. Except for the measurement of FFM ( kg) ( r = 0.03; P = .721; ρ = 0.107; P = .246) , the percentage of variation between M0 and M3 for FM % ( r = 0.41 , P < .001; ρ = 0.534; P < .001) and FMkg ( r = 0.64 P < .001; ρ = 0.572; P < .001) are significantly correlated and show significant concordance between DXA and BIA. FMkg and FM % changes between M0 and M3 are similarly tracked by DXA and BIA whatever the initial degree of obesity ( based on initial weight , BMI , FM % and FFMkg tertiles). The higher the degree of changes and the higher are the differences between the two devices in measuring FM % and FMkg changes. We found inconsistent and low correlations and concordances between the two devices when tracking FM % changes whatever the degree of weight and FM ( kg and %) variations. The accuracy of body composition assessment using BIA decreases with increasing obesity , and its reliability to track changes is reduced with high initial or variations of body<symptom> weight , FM , FFM and BMI.
