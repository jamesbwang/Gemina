  Bacterial persisters are subpopulations of phenotypic variants in isogenic cultures that can survive lethal doses of antibiotics. Their tolerances are often attributed to reduced activities of antibiotic targets , which limit corruption and damage in persisters compared with bacteria that die from treatment. However , that model does not hold for nongrowing populations treated with ofloxacin , a fluoroquinolone , where antibiotic-induced damage is comparable between cells that live and those that die. To understand how those persisters achieve this feat , we employed a genetic system that uses orthogonal control of MazF and MazE , a toxin and its cognate antitoxin , to generate model persisters that are uniformly tolerant to ofloxacin. Despite this complete tolerance , MazF model persisters required the same DNA repair machinery ( RecA , RecB , and SOS induction) to survive ofloxacin treatment as their nongrowing , WT counterparts and exhibited similar indicators of DNA damage from treatment. Further investigation revealed that , following treatment , the timing of DNA repair was critical to MazF persister survival because , when repair was delayed until after growth and DNA synthesis resumed , survival was compromised. In addition , we found that , with nongrowing , WT planktonic and biofilm populations , stalling the resumption of growth and DNA synthesis after the conclusion of fluoroquinolone treatment with a prevalent type of stress at infection sites ( nutrient limitation) led to near complete survival. These findings illustrate that the timing of events , such as DNA repair , following fluoroquinolone treatment is important to persister survival and provide further evidence that knowledge of the postantibiotic recovery period is critical to understanding persistence phenotypes.
