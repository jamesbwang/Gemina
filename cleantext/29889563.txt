  This study examined the moderating role of parental behaviors in the longitudinal link between peer victimization and sleep problems during preschool. The sample consisted of 1,181 children ( 594 girls) attending day care between the ages of 3 and 6 years. Participants were part of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development , a longitudinal study of child development led by the Institut de la Statistique du Quebec. Controlling for potential confounders , latent growth curve analyses revealed that the association between peer victimization and sleep problems varied depending on parents ' behaviors. Coercive parenting exacerbated the link between peer victimization and parasomnias. In contrast , positive parenting mitigated the link between peer victimization and insomnia. The findings suggest that persistent sleep problems at a young age may be an indicator of chronic peer victimization but that parents ' behaviors can play a key role in victimized children 's sleep problems.
