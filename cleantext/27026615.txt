  Drug repositioning for available medications can be preferred over traditional drug development , which requires substantially more effort to uncover new insights into medications and diseases. Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS) and Phenome-Wide Association Studies ( PheWAS) are two complimentary methods for finding novel associations between genes and diseases. We hypothesize that discoveries from these studies could be leveraged to find new targets for existing drugs. Thus , we propose a framework to learn opportunities for inferring such relationships via overlapped genes between disease-associated genes ( e.g. GWAS and PheWAS findings) and drugtargeted genes. We use drug indications found in Medication Indication Resource ( MEDI) as a gold standard to evaluate if drug indications learned from GWAS and PheWAS findings have clinical indications. We examined 151,011 < drug , GWAS phenotype > pairs from 987 drugs across 153 diseases and 763 pairs were statistically significant. Out of these 763 pairs , 16 of them were found to have clinical indications.
