  Erectile dysfunction is a common side effect of finasteride and dutasteride treatments. The objective of this study was to investigate the structural changes in the penis using a benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH) rodent model treated with dutasteride or finasteride. Sixty male rats were divided into the following groups: C , untreated control rats; C + D , control rats receiving dutasteride; C + F , control rats receiving finasteride; H , untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHRs); H + D , SHRs treated with dutasteride; and H + F , SHRs treated with finasteride. Treatments were performed for 40 days , and penises were collected immediately thereafter. The organs were analyzed using histomorphometric methods to determine the cross-sectional penile area , as well as the surface density ( Sv) of smooth muscle fibers , connective tissue , elastic system fibers , and sinusoidal spaces of the corpus cavernosum. The results were compared using a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni 's posttest. Groups C + D and C + F had a significantly smaller penile cross-sectional area , but more elastic system fiber Sv compared to Group C. Group C + D showed less smooth muscle Sv , and Group H showed more connective tissue but a smaller sinusoidal space Sv in the corpus cavernosum compared to Group C. Groups H + D and H + F had less smooth muscle Sv than Group H. Group H + D also had more connective tissue and elastic system fiber Sv than Group H. Both dutasteride and finasteride promoted penile modifications in the control rat penis , although this affect was greater in Group H animals. In this rodent model , dutasteride was the drug that most affected the corpus cavernosum.
