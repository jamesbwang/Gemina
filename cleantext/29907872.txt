  The emergence of biologic therapies is arguably the greatest therapeutic advance in the care of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) to date , allowing directed treatments targeted at highly specific molecules shown to play critical roles in disease pathogenesis , with advantages in potency and selectivity. Furthermore , a large number of new biologic and small-molecule therapies in IBD targeting a variety of pathways are at various stages of development that should soon lead to a dramatic expansion in our therapeutic armamentarium. Additionally , since the initial introduction of biologics , there have been substantial advances in our understanding as to how biologics work , the practical realities of their administration , and how to enhance their efficacy and safety in the clinical setting. In this review , we will summarize the current state of the art for biological therapies in IBD , both in terms of agents available and their optimal use , as well as preview future advances in biologics and highly targeted small molecules in the IBD field.
