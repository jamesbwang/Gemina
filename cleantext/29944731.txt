  This work presents a methodology combining SEM , EDS , conventional EBSD , and transmission-EBSD to analyse a recrystallised Zircaloy-4 sheet and cold-worked stress-relieved ( CWSR) Zircaloy-4 cladding in unprecedented detail. Second-phase precipitates ( SPPs) in Zircaloy-4 specimens were revealed after chemical polishing using a solution containing hydrofluoric acid ( HF). Pitting corrosion of Zircaloy-4 specimens was revealed after electropolishing using an electrolyte containing HClO
