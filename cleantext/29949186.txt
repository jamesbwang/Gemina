  To evaluate disease characteristics and long-term outcomes in patients requiring second-line treatment following FCR , for relapsed/refractory disease ( R/R) , or following discontinuation due to toxicities. A retrospective analysis of 126 CLL patients treated with frontline FCR: 63 received second-line treatment ( 41 relapsed , 9 refractory ( SD/PD) , 13 prior toxicity). Time to next treatment ( TTNT) was calculated from beginning FCR to initiation of second-line therapy. Overall and event-free survival were calculated from initiation of salvage treatment ( OS2/EFS2). Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 67 months ( m) and 37m from second-line therapy. TTNT < 24m was associated with shorter OS2 and EFS2 similar to those observed with primary refractory disease ( OS2 19m and 23m; EFS2 12m and 9m for TTNT < 24m and SD/PD respectively). TTNT â‰¥ 24m ( 71 % chemotherapy based second-line) , had longer OS2 and EFS2 ( 48m and 20m). Among the 13 patients receiving second-line therapy after discontinuing FCR due to toxicity EFS2 was 41m ( 59m from initiation of FCR). With limitations of sample size and treatment heterogeneity , patients progressing < 24m following FCR have poor outcomes , similar to refractory patients , while longer remissions are indicative of a chemoimmunotherapy sensitive disease. Patients who discontinue FCR for toxicities may achieve excellent outcomes with subsequent treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
