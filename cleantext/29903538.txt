  Parkinson disease is a common neurodegenerative disease that typically starts around the age of 60 years; however , juvenile-onset disease can occur rarely. Although Parkinson disease is typically sporadic; in rare occasions , it can be caused by a single gene defect that is inherited in an autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , or X-linked manner. Herein , we describe a 10-year-old child who had juvenile-onset parkinsonism with rigidity , bradykinesia<symptom> , dystonia , gait disturbance , and cognitive impairment. Whole exome sequencing showed compound heterozygosity for two previously unreported novel mutations in ATP13A2 ( PARK9): a paternally inherited c. 1321A > T ( p.I441F) and a maternally inherited c. 3205G > A ( p.A1069T). ATP13A2 mutations are rare cause of autosomal recessive juvenile-onset Parkinson disease. Family co-segregation study and the clinical phenotype support that p.I441F and p.A1069T are indeed disease-causing mutations.
