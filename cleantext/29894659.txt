  The extreme complexity of the brain has attracted the attention of neuroscientists and other researchers for a long time. More recently , the neuromorphic hardware has matured to provide a tool to study neuronal dynamics. Here , we study neuronal dynamics using different sets of settings on a neuromorphic chip built with flexible parameters of neuron models. Our unique setting in the network of leaky integrate-and-fire ( LIF) neurons is to introduce a weak noise environment. We observed three different types of collective neuronal activities , each with a clear boundary separating the different types of activity ( phase transition). From this , we constructed a brain phase diagram and discovered that a noise-induced phase ( N-phase) , which is dominated by neuronal avalanche activity ( intermittent aperiodic neuron firing) , emerges in the presence of noise. The dynamics can be manipulated in this N-phase. The discovery of the noise-induced phase is consistent with the literature that analysis of the natural brain shows it must reside in this phase. We suggest that the phase diagram with further refinement may be used for the diagnosis and treatment of mental disease and also suggest that the dynamics may be manipulated to serve as a means of new information processing ( e.g. , for optimization). Neuromorphic chips , similar to the one we used but with a variety of neuron models , may be used to further enhance the understanding of human brain function and accelerate the development of neuroscience research.
