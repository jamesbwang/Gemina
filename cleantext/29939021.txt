  Aplysiasecosterol A ( 1) is a structurally unusual 9,11-secosteroid isolated from the sea hare<pathogen> Aplysia kurodai. We have accomplished the first and asymmetric total synthesis of 1 in a convergent fashion. The left-hand segment bearing three adjacent stereocenters was constructed through desymmetrizing reduction , ketalization , and radical cyclization. A strategy of asymmetric 2-bromoallylation followed by spontaneous desymmetrizing lactolization enabled a more expeditious access to this segment. The right-hand segment was prepared through two different approaches: one featuring Myers alkylation and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling and the other relying upon Aggarwal lithiation-borylation and Zweifel-Evans olefination. The two fragments were coupled by a Reformatsky type reaction. The three consecutive stereocenters embedded in the central domain of 1 were generated by an iron-mediated , hydrogen atom transfer based radical cyclization reaction.
