  The anterolateral thigh ( ALT) flap is a viable and reliable option for phalloplasty. The primary advantages of the ALT flap remain an inconspicuous donor site and flexibility in phallus length. The disadvantages of the ALT flap are a higher incidence of both flap and urethral complications compared with a radial forearm phalloplasty. Although the ALT phalloplasty can achieve the primary goals of standing micturition , penetrative intercourse , and an aesthetic phallus , multiple stages and revisions are often necessary. Careful patient selection is paramount in attaining acceptable results with the ALT phalloplasty technique.
