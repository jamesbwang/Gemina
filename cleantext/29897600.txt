  The multi-protein complex WRAD , formed by WDR5 , RbBP5 , Ash2L and Dpy30 , binds to the MLL SET domain to stabilize the catalytically active conformation required for histone H3K4 methylation. In addition , the WRAD complex contributes to the targeting of the activated complex to specific sites on chromatin. RbBP5 is central to MLL catalytic activation , by making critical contacts with the other members of the complex. Interestingly its only major structural domain , a canonical WD40 repeat β-propeller , is not implicated in this function. Here , we present the structure of the RbBP5 β-propeller domain revealing a distinct , feature rich surface , dominated by clusters of Arginine residues. Our nuclear magnetic resonance binding data supports the hypothesis that in addition to the role of RbBP5 in catalytic activation , its β-propeller domain is a platform for the recruitment of the MLL complexes to chromatin targets through its direct interaction with nucleic acids.
