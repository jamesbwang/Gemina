  Peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates ( POCs) are interesting molecules as they covalently combine 2 of the most important biomacromolecules. Sometimes , the synthesis of POCs involves unexpected difficulties; however , POCs with self-assembling propensity are even harder to synthesize and purify. Here , we show that solid-phase peptide fragment condensation combined with thiol-maleimide or copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistries is useful for the syntheses of self-assembling POCs. We describe guidelines for the selection of reactive functional groups and their placement during the conjugation reaction and consider the cost-effectiveness of the reaction. Purification is another important challenge during the preparation of POCs. Our results show that polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions is most suitable to recover a high yield of self-assembling POCs. This report provides the first comprehensive study of the preparation of self-assembling POCs , which will lay a foundation for the development of elegant and sophisticated molecular assemblies.
