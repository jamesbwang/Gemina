  Acquired aerodigestive fistulae<disease> ( ADF) are rare , but associated with a high mortality rate. We present our experience of the diagnosis , management and outcomes of patients with ADFs treated at a tertiary centre. Utilising our findings , we propose an anatomical classification system , demonstrating how specific features of an ADF may determine management. A clinical database was searched and 48 patients with an ADF were identified. A classification system was developed based on anatomical location of the ADF and differences in clinico-pathological features based on this categorisation were performed , with the chi-squared test used for inferential analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test to assess survival. Twenty ( 41.6 %) patients developed an ADF secondary to malignancy , with previous radiotherapy ( 18.7 %) , post-operative anastomotic dehiscence and endotherapy ( 14.6 % each) representing other causes. Thirty-one patients were managed with tracheal and/or oesophageal stents and eight underwent surgical repair. The classification system demonstrated benign causes of ADF were either proximally or distally sited , whilst a malignant cause resulted in mid-tracheal fistulae<disease> ( p = 0.001) , with the latter associated with poorer survival. ADFs over 20 mm in size were associated with poor survival ( p = 0.011) , as was the use of previous radiotherapy. Proximal and distal ADFs were associated with improved survival ( p = 0.006) , as were those patients managed surgically ( p = 0.001). By classifying ADFs , we have demonstrated that anatomical location correlates with the size , history of malignancy , previous radiotherapy and aetiology of ADF , which can affect management. The proposed classification system will aid in formulating multi-modality individualised treatment plans.
