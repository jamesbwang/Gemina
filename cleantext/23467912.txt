  Transforming growth factor β1 ( TGF-β1) and salvianolic acid B ( Sal-B) are key signaling factors for stem cell differentiation into cardiomyocytes ( CMs). The present study compared the biological effect of TGF-β1 and Sal-B , alone or in combination , on bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stromal cells ( BMSCs) that differentiate into myocardial-like cells in a simulated myocardial microenvironment
