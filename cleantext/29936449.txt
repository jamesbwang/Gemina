  Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> is responsible for most cases of endodontic treatment failure. Despite various conventional disinfection methods , root canals are not completely free of microorganisms. Photodynamic therapy ( PDT) is a new antimicrobial strategy that involves the use of a non-toxic photosensitizer ( PS) and a light source. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of PDT using diode laser and pyoktanin blue ( PB) and confirm the nontoxicity of PB as a PS. Laser irradiation with an output power of 3 W was performed with PB as the PS to a bacterial solution containing E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen>. Then , the number of colony-forming units was counted. PB cytotoxicity was also assessed by the MTT assay. E faecalis counts were reduced after laser irradiation , laser irradiation with PB , or the combination thereof compared to the control , non-irradiation or water. The 50 % cytotoxic concentration value for adult human dermal fibroblasts incubated with PB for 1 min was 108 Î¼g/ml. Diode laser irradiation in combination with PB as the PS is efficacious for the elimination of E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> without toxic effects to human dermal fibroblasts. This strategy might be useful for root canal irrigants.
