  Novel acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 ( ACC2) selective inhibitors were identified by the conversion of the alkyne unit of A-908292 to the olefin linker. Modification of the center and left part of the lead compound 1b improved the ACC2 inhibitory activity and CYP450 inhibition profile , and afforded a highly selective ACC2 inhibitor 2e which showed in vivo efficacy in C57BL/6 mice.
