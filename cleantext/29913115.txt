  A mixed-methods needs assessment was conducted in an urban senior center serving lower-income seniors in Toronto , Ontario , to determine whether they should offer a congregate meal program. Methods included three focus groups with participants ( n = 31) , a focus group with staff ( n = 8) , a center-wide survey ( n = 36) , and a community scan of programs in the area. Interviews with five coordinators at other seniors ' centers who offered meal programs were also used to gauge interest and assist with program development. The results of these activities supported offering a twice weekly lunch program with user fees. Over a 6-month pilot period , process evaluation was conducted , comprising observations , record review , and focus groups with participants ( n = 9) and staff/volunteers ( n = 7) to examine delivery , usage , and costs. Results indicated that the program was well-received and affordable , and that demands on staff were reasonable when a facilitator with culinary training was available. The lessons learned can be used to guide other senior centers in developing and evaluating congregate meal programs.
