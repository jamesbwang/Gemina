  The interaction of small compounds ( i.e. ligands) with macromolecules or macromolecule assemblies ( i.e. targets) is the mechanism of action of most of the drugs available today. Mass spectrometry is a popular technique for the interrogation of macromolecule-ligand interactions and therefore is also widely used in drug discovery and development. Thanks to its versatility , mass spectrometry is used for multiple purposes such as biomarker screening , identification of the mechanism of action , ligand structure optimization or toxicity assessment. The evolution and automation of the instruments now allows the development of high throughput methods with high sensitivity and a minimized false discovery rate. Herein , all these approaches are described with a focus on the methods for studying macromolecule-ligand interaction aimed at defining the structure-activity relationships of drug candidates , along with their mechanism of action , metabolism and toxicity.
