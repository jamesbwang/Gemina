  Environmental stress affects growth and development of crops , and reduces yield and quality of crops. To cope with environmental stressors , plants have sophisticated defense mechanisms , including the HSF/HSP pathway. Here , we identify the expression pattern of CaHSP16 .4 in thermo-tolerant and thermo-sensitive pepper ( Capsicum annuum L.) lines. Under heat stress , R9 thermo-tolerant line had higher CaHSP16 .4 expression level than the B6 thermo-sensitive line. Under drought stress , expression pattern of CaHSP16 .4 was dynamic. Initially , CaHSP16 .4 was downregulated then CaHSP16 .4 significantly increased. Subcellular localization assay showed that CaHSP16 .4 localizes in cytoplasm and nucleus. In the R9 line , silencing of CaHSP16 .4 resulted in a significant increase in malonaldehyde content and a significant reduction in total chlorophyll content , suggesting that silencing of CaHSP16 .4 reduces heat and drought stresses tolerance. Overexpression of CaHSP16 .4 enhances tolerance to heat stress in Arabidopsis. Under heat stress , the survival rate of CaHSP16 .4 overexpression lines was significantly higher than wild type. Furthermore , under heat , drought , and combined stress conditions , the CaHSP16.4-overexpression lines had lower relative electrolytic leakage and malonaldehyde content , higher total chlorophyll content , and higher activity levels of superoxide dismutase , catalase , ascorbic acid peroxidase , and glutathione peroxidase compared to wild type. Furthermore , the expression levels of the stress response genes in the overexpression lines were higher than the wild type. These results indicate that the overexpression of CaHSP16 .4 enhances the ability of reactive oxygen species scavenging under heat and drought stress.
