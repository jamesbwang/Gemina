  Rebalancing the contribution of animal- and plant-based foods is needed to achieve sustainable diet. However , little is known concerning individual characteristics that may influence intake of plant-based foods and their changes over time. We aimed to assess changes in the contribution of plant-based foods to dietary intake over time and their association with individual characteristics. The contribution of plant-based foods was assessed by percent energy intake provided by plant proteins in diet ( PEIPP) and a score of adherence to a pro-vegetarian diet , using repeated 24-h records in 15,615 French adults participating in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study. Associations between baseline individual characteristics and changes in the two indicators over a 4-6-year follow-up were assessed using a linear mixed model. At baseline , PEIPP and pro-vegetarian score were positively associated with age ( β65 + = 0.80 , 95 % CI = ( 0.71 , 0.88) , β65 + = 3.30 , 95 % CI = ( 2.97 , 3.64) , respectively) and education ( βpostgraduate = 0.23 , 95 % CI = ( 0.12 , 0.34) , βpostgraduate = 1.19 , 95 % CI = ( 0.75 , 1.62)) , while they were inversely associated with BMI class ( βobesity =- 0.48 , 95 % CI = ( 0.56 , 0.41) , βobesity =- 2.31 , 95 % CI = (- 2.63 ,- 1.98)). Men had higher PEIPP than women ( β = 0.06 , 95 % CI = ( 0.01 , 0.11)). Pro-vegetarian score significantly increased over time ( β = 0.23 , 95 % CI = ( 0.08 , 0.37)). The older the individual at baseline , the greater the decrease in the two indicators during follow-up. Pro-vegetarian score increased during follow-up for obese participants at baseline. The contribution of plant-based foods was associated with several socio-demographic and economic characteristics at baseline , whereas change over time was related to age and weight<symptom> status<symptom>. Further analysis of individual obstacles and lever to consume plant-based foods is needed.
