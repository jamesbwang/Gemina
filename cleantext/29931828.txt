  We investigated polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB) contamination at the Ashtabula River ( northeast OH , USA) area of concern following remedial dredging using araneid and tetragnathid spiders. The PCB concentrations remain elevated in the area of concern compared with reference conditions. Patterns of contamination were strikingly similar between taxa , but were higher in tetragnathids at the most contaminated sites. Spider PCB homolog distributions identified 2 PCB sources to the area of concern. Based on these findings , we recommend situations where these taxa can be used alone , in concert , or combined into a composite `` spider '' sample to assess environmental contamination.
