  Computational modelling of the cardiovascular system offers much promise , but represents a truly interdisciplinary challenge , requiring knowledge of physiology , mechanics of materials , fluid dynamics and biochemistry. This paper aims to provide a summary of the recent advances in cardiovascular structural modelling , including the numerical methods , main constitutive models and modelling procedures developed to represent cardiovascular structures and pathologies across a broad range of length and timescales; serving as an accessible point of reference to newcomers to the field. The class of so-called hyperelastic materials provides the theoretical foundation for the modelling of how these materials deform under load , and so an overview of these models is provided; comparing classical to application-specific phenomenological models. The physiology is split into components and pathologies of the cardiovascular system and linked back to constitutive modelling developments , identifying current state of the art in modelling procedures from both clinical and engineering sources. Models which have originally been derived for one application and scale are shown to be used for an increasing range and for similar applications. The trend for such approaches is discussed in the context of increasing availability of high performance computing resources , where in some cases computer hardware can impact the choice of modelling approach used.
