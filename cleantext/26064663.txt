  We analyse more than 500000 songs released in the UK between 1985 and 2015 to understand the dynamics of success ( defined as ` making it ' into the top charts) , correlate success with acoustic features and explore the predictability of success. Several multi-decadal trends have been uncovered. For example , there is a clear downward trend in ` happiness ' and ` brightness ' , as well as a slight upward trend in ` sadness '. Furthermore , songs are becoming less ` male '. Interestingly , successful songs exhibit their own distinct dynamics. In particular , they tend to be ` happier ' , more ` party-like ' , less ` relaxed ' and more ` female ' than most. The difference between successful and average songs is not straightforward. In the context of some features , successful songs pre-empt the dynamics of all songs , and in others they tend to reflect the past. We used random forests to predict the success of songs , first based on their acoustic features , and then adding the ` superstar ' variable ( informing us whether the song 's artist had appeared in the top charts in the near past). This allowed quantification of the contribution of purely musical characteristics in the songs ' success , and suggested the time scale of fashion dynamics in popular music.
