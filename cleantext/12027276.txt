  To date , no culture-specific food frequency questionnaires ( FFQ) are available in North Africa. The aim of this study was to adapt and examine the reproducibility and validity of an FFQ or use in the Moroccan population. The European Global Asthma and Allergy Network ( GA The adapted FFQ was comprised of 255 items that included traditional Moroccan foods. Eighty-seven adults ( mean age 27.3 Â± 5.7 years) completed all the questionnaires. For energy and nutrients , the intakes reported in the FFQ1 were higher than the mean intakes reported by the 24-h recall questionnaires. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the first FFQ and the mean of three 24-h recall questionnaires were statistically significant. For validity , de-attenuated correlations were all positive , statistically significant and ranging from 0.24 ( fiber) to 0.93 ( total MUFA). For reproducibility , the ICCs were statistically significant and ranged between 0.69 for fat and 0.84 for Vitamin A. This adapted FFQ is an acceptable tool to assess usual dietary intake in Moroccan adults. Given its representativeness of local food intake , it can be used as an instrument to investigate the role of diet on health and disease outcomes.
