  Cellular carriers for drug delivery are attractive alternatives to synthetic nanoparticles owing to their innate homing/targeting abilities. Here , we review molecular interactions involved in the homing of Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) and other cell types to understand the process of designing and engineering highly efficient , actively targeting cellular vehicles. In addition , we comprehensively discuss various genetic and non-genetic strategies and propose a few futuristic approaches of engineering MSC homing using micro/nanotechnology and high throughput small molecule screening. Most of the targeting abilities of a cell come from its plasma membrane , thus , efforts to harness cell membranes<symptom> as drug delivery vehicles are gaining importance and are highlighted here. We also recognize and report the lack of detailed characterization of cell membranes<symptom> in terms of safety , structural integrity , targeting functionality , and drug transport. Finally , we provide insights on future development of bioengineered cellular and cell membrane-derived vesicles for successful clinical translation.
