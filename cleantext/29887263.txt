  A large proportion of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases ( CRCLM) not amenable to curative liver resection will progress on systemic therapy. Intra-arterial therapies ( IAT) including conventional transarterial chemoembolization ( cTACE) , drug eluting beads ( DEB-TACE) and yttrium-90 radioembolization ( Y-90) are indicated to prolong survival and palliate symptoms. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the survival benefit and radiologic response of three intra-arterial therapies in patients with chemorefractory and unresectable CRCLM. A systematic search for eligible references in the Cochrane Library and the EMBASE , MEDLINE and TRIP databases from January 2000 to November 2016 was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the MINORS scale. One-year overall survival rates and RECIST responder rates were pooled using inverse-variance weighted random-effects models. Overall survival outcomes were collected according to transformed pooled median survivals from first IAT with a subgroup analysis of patients with extrahepatic disease. Twenty-three prospective studies were included and analyzed: 5 cTACE ( n = 746) , 5 DEB-TACE ( n = 222) and 13 Y-90 ( n = 615). All but five were clinical trials. Eleven of 13 Y-90 studies were industry funded. Pooled RECIST response rates with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) were: cTACE 23 % ( 9.7 , 36) , DEB-TACE 36 % ( 0 , 73) and Y-90 23 % ( 11 , 34). The pooled 1-year survival rates with CI were: cTACE , 70 % ( 49 , 87) , DEB-TACE , 80 % ( 74 , 86) and Y-90 , 41 % ( 28 , 54). Transformed pooled median survivals from first IAT and ranges for cTACE , DEB-TACE and Y-90 were 16 months ( 9.0-23) , 16 months ( 7.3-25) and 12 months ( 7.0-15) , respectively. Significant heterogeneity in inclusion criteria and reporting of confounders , including previous therapy , tumor burden and post-IAT therapy , precluded statistical comparisons between the three therapies. Methodological and statistical heterogeneity precluded consensus on the optimal treatment strategy. Given the common use and significant cost of radioembolization in this setting , a more robust prospective comparative trial is warranted.
