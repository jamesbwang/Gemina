  For successful reshaping of the cranial vault in terms of corrective fronto-orbital advancement ( FOA) efficient and reliable internal fixation systems for stabilization of bone fragments are indispensable. The rate of complications and feasibility of corrective FOA with the usage of titanium-based rigid fixation systems is rarely analyzed and discussed. The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 42 patients who received corrective FOA with the implementation of titanium internal rigid fixation and consecutive secondary surgery for removal. The reliability of the fixation system was judged by the outcome of the FOA as evaluated by the Whitaker score , esthetic outcome as well as by the complication rate of the secondary intervention , necessary for removal of the fixation system. All patients were categorized as Whitaker I ( no further treatment desirable). Esthetic outcome was excellent in all patients as judged by surgeon and parents. Mean age at the time of FOA was 9.3 months. Time to removal , duration of the second hospital stay for removal of the fixation system , and duration of surgical drains were on average 5 months , 2 days , and 1.7 days , respectively. Mean duration of the secondary surgery was 63 min. No complications occurred. Our investigation supports the usage of titanium internal rigid fixation systems in pediatric craniofacial surgery , thereby providing a reliable alternative to avoid the well-documented problems of bio-absorbable plate fixation systems.
