  To evaluate the visual and anatomical outcomes of intravitreal ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema<symptom> ( DME) in the healthcare system of Taiwan. A total of 39 eyes from 39 patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study. All eyes that fulfilled the key criteria , including a baseline vision between 20 and 70 ETDRS letters and a minimum central macular thickness ( CMT) of 300 µm , had at least 3 monthly loading injections of ranibizumab in a year. Macular laser or posterior subtenon injections of triamcinolone acetonide ( PSTA) could be performed as supplementary treatments following loading injections. Primary outcomes include best-corrected visual acuity and CMT. Patients ' vision improved from 46.5 ± 15.3 letters at baseline to 51.4 ± 16.6 letters at 12 months ( p = 0.031). Mean CMT at baseline was 406 ± 105 µm , which decreased to 329 ± 108 µm ( p = 0.002). At 12 months , 44.4 % of eyes with total injection number < 5 and 42.9 % with injection number ≥ 5 achieved a gain in vision that was 10 letters or more. A total of 5 injections or more did not lead to a better visual gain in comparison with only 3-4 injections ( p = 0.71) , and both had similar number of supplementary treatments ( p = 0.43). Monthly reinjections of ranibizumab resulted in a lower likelihood of visual loss of 10 or 15 letters ( p = 0.019 and 0.015 , respectively , adjusted for age , baseline vision , severity of diabetic retinopathy and the presence of previous treatments); however , supplementary macular lasers , PSTA or ranibizumab without monthly reinjections did not ( all p > 0.05). The average number of injections was 4.3 ± 1.0. Treatment for DME with at least three monthly ranibizumab loading injections , with or without other supplementary treatments , is effective at 12 months thereafter. Two monthly reinjections of ranibizumab , while not significantly increasing vision , may have a role in preventing visual loss.
