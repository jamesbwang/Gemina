  To describe the ontogeny of vertical semicircular canals using computed tomography. We have studied 39 human fetuses aged between 17 and 38 weeks of development through multi-helicoidal CT.. The first signs of ossification in the semicircular canals , superior and posterior , are from 19 weeks of development , through two primary ossification centers in each canal , which will take part in the formation of the outer cover oriented towards the middle and posterior brain fossae , respectively. In this process it must be added the intervention of the common branch. Internal bone covers are formed by ossification of the fossa subarcuata in the superior semicircular canal , and from the compact center of the labyrinthine capsule into the posterior canal. The tomographic study has allowed us to demonstrate how ossification follows a variable rate , establishing a period between 21 and 26 weeks where there are completely closed canals with others still open to the brain fossae. The tomographic study of the semicircular canals has enabled us to establish a critical period in its ossification that could explain the etiology of the congenital-type dehiscence.
