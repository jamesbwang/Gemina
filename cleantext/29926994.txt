  Dogs with atopic dermatitis<disease> are prone to sensitization to environmental allergens due to increased skin permeability; the effect of treatments on epicutaneous sensitizations is unknown. To evaluate if oclacitinib ( i) prevents new sensitizations and ( ii) affects skin barrier function. Atopic beagle dogs. Aim 1. Ten dogs were randomly assigned to placebo or oclacitinib while exposed epicutaneously to a novel allergen. Sensitization was assessed using serum allergen-specific IgE and clinically by development of skin reactions at the site of allergen application. Time to develop dermatitis<disease> and allergen-specific IgE were compared between groups. Aim 2. Eight dogs were randomly assigned to placebo or oclacitinib for four weeks and challenged with an allergen known to trigger flares. After a four week wash-out , dogs were crossed-over and the protocol repeated. Transepidermal water loss ( TEWL) was measured on days 0 and 28 of each arm. Aim 1. Oclacitinib significantly increased ( P = 0.006) time to develop skin reactions compared to placebo. Four ( of five) dogs receiving oclacitinib failed to develop skin reactions , whereas all placebo dogs developed dermatitis<disease>. There were no significant differences in allergen-specific IgE between groups. Aim 2. TEWL results were difficult to interpret. Significantly higher values were detected from the axilla in placebo compared to oclacitinib-treated dogs ( P = 0.047). TEWL values were significantly higher from the inguinal area in oclacitinib ( P = 0.039) treated dogs but not placebo at the end of the study. Clinically , oclacitinib delayed development of dermatitis<disease> at the site of allergen application. TEWL results were difficult to interpret and additional studies are required for clarification.
