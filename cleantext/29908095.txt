  The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic , antiproliferative activity and the induction of apoptosis by L-amino acid oxidase isolated from Calloselasma rhodostoma crude venom ( CR-LAAO) on human colon cancer cells. CR-LAAO was purified using three chromatographic steps: molecular exclusion using G-50 gel filtration resin , ion-exchange by MonoQ column and desalted on a G25 column. The purity and identity of the isolated CR-LAAO was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. CR-LAAO demonstrated time- and dose-dependent cytotoxic activity on SW480 ( primary human colon cancer cells) and SW620 ( metastatic human colon cancer cells) with an EC
