  Free thiol content , and its consistency , is one of the product quality attributes of interest during technical development of manufactured recombinant monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs). We describe a new , mid/high-throughput reversed-phase-high performance liquid chromatography ( RP-HPLC) method coupled with derivatization of free thiols , for the determination of total free thiol content in an E. coli-expressed therapeutic monovalent monoclonal antibody mAb1. Initial selection of the derivatization reagent used an hydrophobicity-tailored approach. Maleimide-based thiol-reactive reagents with varying degrees of hydrophobicity were assessed to identify and select one that provided adequate chromatographic resolution and robust quantitation of free thiol-containing mAb1 forms. The method relies on covalent derivatization of free thiols in denatured mAb1 with N-tert-butylmaleimide ( NtBM) label , followed by RP-HPLC separation with UV-based quantitation of native ( disulfide containing) and labeled ( free thiol containing) forms. The method demonstrated good specificity , precision , linearity , accuracy and robustness. Accuracy of the method , for samples with a wide range of free thiol content , was demonstrated using admixtures as well as by comparison to an orthogonal LC-MS peptide mapping method with isotope tagging of free thiols. The developed method has a facile workflow which fits well into both R&D characterization and quality control ( QC) testing environments. The hydrophobicity-tailored approach to the selection of free thiol derivatization reagent is easily applied to the rapid development of free thiol quantitation methods for full-length recombinant antibodies.
