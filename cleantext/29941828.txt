  Quantum dot ( QD)- sensitized solar cells ( QDSSCs) are expected to achieve higher energy conversion efficiency than traditional single-junction silicon solar cells due to the unique properties of QDs. An inverse opal ( IO)- TiO ₂ ( IO-TiO ₂) electrode is useful for QDSSCs because of its three-dimensional ( 3D) periodic nanostructures and better electrolyte penetration compared to the normal nanoparticles ( NPs)- TiO ₂ ( NPs-TiO ₂) electrode. We find that the open-circuit voltages
