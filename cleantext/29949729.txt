  AIMS To develop an equation that accurately estimates fat-free mass ( FFM) and the ratio of FFM to skeletal size or mass , using morphometric measurements in lean working farm dogs , and to examine the association between FFM derived from body condition score ( BCS) and FFM measured using isotope dilution. METHODS Thirteen Huntaway and seven Heading working dogs from sheep and beef farms in the Waikato region of New Zealand were recruited based on BCS ( BCS < 3 , 3-4 , > 4) using a nine-point scale. Bodyweight , BCS , and morphometric measurements ( head length and circumference , body length , thoracic girth , and fore and hind<symptom> limb length) were recorded for each dog , and body composition was measured using an isotopic dilution technique. A new variable using morphometric measurements , termed skeletal size , was created using principal component analysis. Models for predicting FFM , leanST ( FFM minus skeletal mass) and ratios of FFM and leanST to skeletal size or mass were generated using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS Mean FFM of the 20 dogs , measured by isotope dilution , was 22.1 ( SD 4.4) kg and the percentage FFM of bodyweight was 87.0 ( SD 5.0) %. Median BCS was 3.0 ( min 1 , max 6). Bodyweight , breed , age and skeletal size or mass were associated with measured FFM ( p < 0.001). There was a good correlation between predicted FFM and measured FFM ( R
