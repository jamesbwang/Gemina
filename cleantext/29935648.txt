  To compare the genomic profiles of blastocoel fluid ( BF) , inner cell mass ( ICM) , and trophectoderm ( TE) cells derived from the same blastocyst. Prospective study. Academic and in vitro fertilization units. Sixteen donated cryopreserved embryos at blastocyst stage. BF , TE , and ICM cells were retrieved from each blastocyst for chromosome analysis by means of next-generation sequencing ( NGS). Aneuploidy screening and assessment of mosaicism in BF , TE and ICM samples with subsequent comparison of genomic profiles between the three blastocyst compartments. Out of 16 blastocysts , 10 BF samples and 14 TE and ICM samples provided reliable NGS data for comprehensive chromosome analysis. Only 40.0 % of BF-DNA karyotypes were fully concordant with TE or ICM , compared with 85.7 % concordance between TE and ICM. In addition , BF-DNA was burdened with mosaic aneuploidies and the total number of affected chromosomes in BF was significantly higher compared with the TE and ICM. BF-DNA can be successfully amplified and subjected to NGS , but owing to increased discordance with ICM and TE , BF does not adequately represent the status of the rest of the embryo. To overcome biologic and technical challenges associated with BF sampling and processing , blastocentesis would require improvement in both laboratory protocols and aneuploidy calling algorithms. Therefore , TE biopsy remains the most effective way to predict embryonic karyotype , and the use of BF as a single source of DNA for preimplantation genetic screening is not yet advised.
