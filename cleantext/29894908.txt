  The purpose of this study is to elucidate differences in the mechanism of the IL-1β release-inducing activity of Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> toward dendritic cells and macrophages because IL-1β is one of the proinflammatory cytokines which is crucial in host defense against candidiasis. Two C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> strains were used in this study. One strain is uridine-auxotrophic ( CAI4) that needs uridine to grow and form hyphae , and another is a strain without any specific auxotrophy ( pACT1-GFP) , which forms hyphae naturally by culturing with serum components. Murine macrophage and dendritic cell lines were primed with LPS and then stimulated with C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> CAI4 or pACT1-GFP. Both strains of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> induced IL-1β release from dendritic cells , and C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> pACT1-GFP induced IL-1β release but CAI4 induced little amounts in macrophages. These differences were suggested to be due to the difference in the amount of extracellular ATP released in the cell culture supernatants induced by C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> CAI4 or pACT1-GFP. For induction of IL-1β release from both macrophages and dendritic cells by C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , direct contacts of the microbes with cells were required. In addition , macrophages required morphological change of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> from yeast to hyphae for induction of IL-1β release , whereas dendritic cells did not require it. Dead C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> could induce IL-1β release from dendritic cells , but could not from macrophages. There are different mechanisms by which C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> induces IL-1β release from dendritic cells and macrophages.
