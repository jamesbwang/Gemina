  High overdose mortality after release from state prison systems is well documented; however , little is known about overdose mortality following release from local criminal justice systems ( CJS). The purpose of this study was to assess overdose mortality following release from a local CJS in Philadelphia , PA.. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of individuals released to the community from a local CJS between 2010 and 2016. Incarceration records were linked to overdose fatality data from the Medical Examiner 's Office and death certificate records. All-cause , overdose , and non-overdose mortality were examined. Of the 82,780 individuals released between 2010 and 2016 , 2,522 ( 3 %) died from any cause , of which 837 ( 33 %) succumbed to overdose. Individuals released from incarceration had higher risk of overdose death compared to the non-incarcerated population ( Standardized Mortality Ratio ( SMR): 5.29 , 95 % CI 4.93-5.65) , and risk was greatest during the first two weeks following release ( SMR: 36.91 , 95 % CI: 29.92-43.90). Among released individuals , black , non-Hispanic individuals ( Hazard Rate ( HR): 0.17 , 95 % CI: 0.14-0.19) and Hispanic individuals ( HR: 0.41 , 95 % CI: 0.34-0.50) were at lower risk for overdose than white , non-Hispanic individuals. Individuals released with a serious mental illness ( SMI) were at higher risk of overdose ( HR: 1.54 , 95 % CI: 1.27-1.87) than those without a SMI. Previously incarcerated individuals are at high risk of overdose death following release from a local CJS , especially in the earliest weeks following release. Prevention measures including behavioral health treatment and referral and take-home naloxone may reduce overdose mortality after release.
