  The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of maternal mortality due to postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> , and to investigate whether national preventative measures of the Maternal Mortality Program have been successful in Turkey. A population-based cohort study. Turkish National Maternal Mortality Data collected by the Turkish Ministry of Health. Women who died due to hemorrhage<symptom> during pregnancy or after delivery within the initial 42 days , from 2012 to 2015 , throughout Turkey ( N = 812/146). The preventability and problems in each maternal death due to hemorrhage<symptom>. A total of 779 maternal deaths were identified during the study period. Our estimate of the Maternal Mortality Ratio ( MMR) in the 3-year period was 19.7 per 100,000 live births. Of the 779 deaths , the report listed 411 as direct and 285 as indirect deaths. Direct obstetric complications were the leading causes of maternal deaths , the most common of which was maternal cardiovascular diseases ( 21 %) and obstetric hemorrhage<symptom> ( 20.6 %). Improving data surveillance and implementing national guidelines for the prevention and management of major complications of pregnancy , childbirth , and puerperium is necessary to reduce MMR. The healthcare authorities of Turkey should continue to set a sustainable development goal of â‰¤ 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. We believe our results may provide useful information for other developing countries that are aiming to reduce maternal mortality , as well as mobilize global efforts to improve women 's health.
