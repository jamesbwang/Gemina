  The optimal treatment option for non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma ( nccRCC) is not established. We conducted a multicenter phase II trial of axitinib for patients with advanced nccRCC who had failed prior treatment with temsirolimus. Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent nccRCC received 5 mg axitinib twice daily. Prior use of vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitors was not allowed. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS) , and the secondary endpoints were objective response rate ( ORR) , disease control rate , overall survival , and safety. Forty patients were included between January 2013 and December 2016. The median age was 59 years ( range , 22-84 years). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status were 0 ( 7.5 %) and 1 ( 92.5 %) , and 82.5 % of patients had undergone prior nephrectomy. Papillary type 2 ( 60.0 %) was the most common histology , and patients belonged to favorable ( 12.5 %) , intermediate ( 72.5 %) , and poor ( 15.0 %) risk groups according to the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk stratification. With a median follow-up duration of 14.7 months ( 95 % confidence interval , ( CI) , 10.8-18.6 months) , the median PFS was 7.4 months ( 95 % CI , 5.2-9.5 months). The ORR was 37.5 % , and the disease control rate was 67.5 %. The median overall survival was 12.1 months ( 95 % CI , 6.4-17.7 months). Most adverse events were manageable , and no unexpected toxicities were found. Axitinib showed promising efficacy in terms of ORR and PFS in recurrent or metastatic nccRCC when used after failure with temsirolimus.
