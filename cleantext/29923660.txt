  Experienced video game players exhibit superior performance in visuospatial cognition when compared to non-players. However , very little is known about the relation between video game experience and structural brain plasticity. To address this issue , a direct comparison of the white matter brain structure in RTS ( real time strategy) video game players ( VGPs) and non-players ( NVGPs) was performed. We hypothesized that RTS experience can enhance connectivity within and between occipital and parietal regions , as these regions are likely to be involved in the spatial and visual abilities that are trained while playing RTS games. The possible influence of long-term RTS game play experience on brain structural connections was investigated using diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) and a region of interest ( ROI) approach in order to describe the experience-related plasticity of white matter. Our results revealed significantly more total white matter connections between occipital and parietal areas and within occipital areas in RTS players compared to NVGPs. Additionally , the RTS group had an altered topological organization of their structural network , expressed in local efficiency within the occipito-parietal subnetwork. Furthermore , the positive association between network metrics and time spent playing RTS games suggests a close relationship between extensive , long-term RTS game play and neuroplastic changes. These results indicate that long-term and extensive RTS game experience induces alterations along axons that link structures of the occipito-parietal loop involved in spatial and visual processing.
