  Previous research has demonstrated the link between school engagement and academic attainment , but there is less understanding of the relationship between school engagement and educational aspirations. Using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England ( LSYPE) , this study examines the association between emotional engagement and educational aspirations during secondary school , covering ages 14 to 16. On average , emotional engagement increased over time. A significant proportion of adolescents shifted from expressing uncertainty to aspiring to continue in education. Males were more likely than females to shift from aspiring to continue in education to planning to leave school early. Greater emotional engagement was associated with a lower likelihood of having low or uncertain aspirations , especially for high-achieving , ethnic minority , and male adolescents. Findings highlight the importance of emotional engagement , particularly for those at risk of uncertain educational aspirations and those least likely to continue in education following post-compulsory schooling.
