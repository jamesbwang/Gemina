  To investigate the role of mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( MPTP) opening in mediating the effect of endomorphine-1 postconditioning to alleviate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion ( IR) injury in rats. Forty-five male SD rats were randomized equally for sham operation , myocardial IR injury , endomorphin-1 postconditioning , atractyloside ( a MPTP opener) postconditioning , or endomorphin-1 + atractyloside postconditioning. The hemodynamic param-eters of the rats were monitored in real time via carotid artery cannulation to the left ventricle. After reperfusion , plasma samples were collected for biochemical analyses. The size of myocardial infarct area was detected using Evans blue and TTC double staining , and the myocardial expressions of apoptosis-related proteins Bax , Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 were analyzed using Western blotting. Myocardial IR injury resulted in significantly decreased heart rate and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in the rats ( P < 0.05). Compared with those in IR group , the rats with endomorphin-1 postconditioning showed significantly increased heart rate and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( P < 0.05) , lowered contents or activities of LDH , CK-MB , cTnI , IL-6 , TNF-Î± , Cyt-C and MDA in the plasma ( P < 0.05) , increased plasma SOD activity ( P < 0.05) , reduced size of myocardial infarction , decreased myocardial expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein ( P < 0.05) , and increased myocardial expression of Bcl-2 protein ( P < 0.05). All these changes induced by endomorphin-1 were obviously reversed by atractyloside postconditioning ( P < 0.05). Endomorphin-1 postconditioning protects against myocardial IR injury in rats probably by inhibiting the opening of MPTP and reducing cardiac myocyte apoptosis via down-regulating cleaved caspase-3 expression.
