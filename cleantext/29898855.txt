  Several new trials evaluating transfusion strategies in patients with cardiovascular disease have recently been published , increasing the number of enrolled patients by over 30 %. The objective was to evaluate transfusion thresholds in patients with cardiovascular disease. We conducted an updated systematic review of randomized trials that compared patients assigned to maintain a lower ( restrictive transfusion strategy) or higher ( liberal transfusion strategy) hemoglobin concentration. We focused on new trial data in patients with cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Specific subgroups were patients undergoing cardiac surgery and with acute myocardial infarction. A total of 37 trials that enrolled 19,049 patients were appraised. In cardiac surgery , mortality at 30days was comparable between groups ( risk ratio 0.99; 95 % confidence interval 0.74-1.33). In 2 small trials ( n = 154) in patients with myocardial infarction , the point estimate for the mortality risk ratio was 3.88 ( 95 % CI , 0.83-18.13) favoring the liberal strategy. Overall , from 26 trials enrolling 15,681 patients , 30-day mortality was not different between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies ( risk ratio 1.0 , 95 % CI , 0.86-1.16). Overall and in the cardiovascular disease subgroup , there were no significant differences observed across a range of secondary outcomes. New trials in patients undergoing cardiac surgery establish that a restrictive transfusion strategy of 7 to 8g/dL is safe and decreased red cell use by 24 %. Further research is needed to define the optimal transfusion threshold in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
