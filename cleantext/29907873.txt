  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM) and restrictive cardiomyopathy ( RCM) present a high risk for sudden cardiac death in pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to identify disease-associated genetic variants in Japanese patients with pediatric HCM and RCM. We analyzed 67 cardiomyopathy-associated genes in 46 HCM and 7 RCM patients diagnosed before 16 years of age using a next-generation sequencing system. We found that 78 % of HCM and 71 % of RCM patients carried disease-associated genetic variants. Disease-associated genetic variants were identified in 80 % of HCM patients with a family history and in 77 % of HCM patients with no apparent family history ( NFH). MYH7 and/or MYBPC3 variants comprised 76 % of HCM-associated variants , whereas troponin complex-encoding genes comprised 75 % of the RCM-associated variants. In addition , 91 % of HCM patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and infant cases had NFH , and the 88 % of HCM patients carrying disease-associated genetic variants were males who carried MYH7 or MYBPC3 variants. Moreover , two disease-associated LAMP2 , one DES and one FHOD3 variants , were identified in HCM patients. In this study , pediatric HCM and RCM patients were found to carry disease-associated genetic variants at a high rate. Most of the variants were in MYH7 or MYPBC3 for HCM and TNNT2 or TNNI3 for RCM.
