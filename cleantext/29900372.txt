  Data file presents information on the variation in sea surface temperatures ( SST) , as well as geochemical ( e.g. stable isotope , calcium carbonate) , micropaleontological and grain size data from the Gloria Drift ( Northwest Atlantic). The data are obtained from the three marine sediment gravity core sections ( AMK-4493 , AI-3646 and AI-3415) which were formed during Quaternary period. Dataset contains SST values ( winter and summer: 0-50 water layer) and ice-rafted debris ( IRD) counts , each in 308 samples; stable isotope data ( Î´
