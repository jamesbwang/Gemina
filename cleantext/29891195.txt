  Metabolic syndrome<disease> is a set of cardiovascular risk factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease , diabetes and mortality. Women are at risk of developing metabolic syndrome<disease> as they enter the postmenopausal period. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> in Iranian postmenopausal women. In this systematic review and meta-analysis , 16 national articles published in Persian and English were gathered without time limit. National databases such as SIDs , IranMedex and MagIran , and international databases such as Web of Science , Google Scholar , PubMed and Scopus were used to search the relevant studies. We searched for articles using the keywords `` menopause '' , `` postmenopausal '' , `` metabolic syndrome<disease> '' , `` MetSyn '' , and their combinations. Data were analyzed using the meta-analysis method and the random effects model. Analysis of 16 selected articles with a sample size of 5893 people showed that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> in Iranian postmenopausal women was 51.6 % ( 95 % CI: 43-60). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> based on ATP III and IDF criteria was 54 % ( 95 % CI: 59-63) and 50 % ( 95 % CI: 45-56) , respectively. Based on the results of univariate meta-regression analysis , the increase in the mean age of postmenopausal women ( p = 0.001) and sample size ( p = 0.029) , the prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> increased significantly. More than half of postmenopausal women in Iran suffer from metabolic syndrome<disease>. Providing training programs for postmenopausal women to prevent and control cardiovascular disease and its complications seems to be necessary.
