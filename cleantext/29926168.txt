  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surgical success of sulcus fixation of Baerveldt glaucoma implant ( BGIs) in special reference to corneal damage. This observational prospective cohort study included 24 patients who underwent a median of 3.0 previous intraocular surgeries and sulcus fixation of BGIs for the first time. The intraocular pressure ( IOP) , the number of ocular hypotensives used , corneal endothelial cell density ( ECD) , and logMAR-converted best-corrected visual acuity ( VA) of each patient were measured preoperatively and postoperatively until 12 months after surgery. Surgical success was evaluated after 12 months based on the reduction of IOP ( 5-21 mmHg and > 20 % reduction) , corneal damage ( postoperative development of decompensation , unmeasurable ECD , or ECD reduction of > 20 %) , loss of light perception , and need for additional surgeries. Surgical success was noted in 16 ( 66.7 %) patients when corneal damage was included as a failure criterion , whereas surgery was successful in 21 ( 87.5 %) patients when solely judged using IOP control similarly as previous clinical trials. The median IOP decreased from 27.5 mmHg preoperatively to 14.5 mmHg postoperatively ( P < 0.0001). The number of ocular hypotensives was significantly reduced postoperatively ( P < 0.0001). The median postoperative ECD reduction was only 0.15 % , although ECD could not be measured during follow-up or it was significantly reduced by > 20 % in six patients. VA was not significantly reduced after surgery. Adverse effects were observed in 15 patients ( 62.5 cumulative %). Sulcus fixation of BGIs may be effective and safe in patients with glaucomatous eyes who underwent multiple prior intraocular surgeries.
