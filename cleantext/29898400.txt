  Glucagon , the principal hyperglycemic hormone , is secreted from pancreatic islet α cells as part of the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia. Hence , secretory output from α cells is under high demand in conditions of low glucose supply. Many tissues oxidize fat as an alternate energy substrate. Here , we show that glucagon secretion in low glucose conditions is maintained by fatty acid metabolism in both mouse and human islets , and that inhibiting this metabolic pathway profoundly decreases glucagon output by depolarizing α cell membrane potential and decreasing action potential amplitude. We demonstrate , by using experimental and computational approaches , that this is not mediated by the K
