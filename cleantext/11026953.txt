  Research is scarce on how mothers ' symptoms of personality disorders are linked to the mother-toddler relationship. In this study we have explored the extent to which these symptoms are associated with mutual mother-toddler interactions assessed 1 year after the initial assessment. Mothers and their 0-24-month-old children ( n = 112) were recruited by nurses at well-baby clinics due to either self-reported or observed mother-toddler interaction problems. At inclusion ( T1) , mothers filled out the DSM-IV and ICD-10 Personality Questionnaire ( DIP-Q) , which measures symptoms of ten personality disorders. A year later ( T2) , mother-toddler interactions were video-recorded and coded using a standardised observation measure , the Emotional Availability Scales. Only maternal schizotypal personality disorder symptoms predicted both the mothers ' and the toddlers ' interactional styles. Mothers with schizotypal personality symptoms appeared less sensitive , less structuring and more intrusive in their interactions with their toddlers , while mothers ' borderline personality disorder symptoms were associated with increased hostility. Furthermore , toddlers who had mothers with schizotypal personality symptoms were less responsive towards their mothers. Measured dimensionally by self-report , maternal schizotypal personality symptoms were observed to predict the interaction styles of both mothers and their toddlers in the dyad , while borderline personality disorder symptoms predicted mothers ' interactional behaviour only.
