  Conventional measures of spinal mobility used in the assessment of patients with axial spondyloarthritis ( axSpA) , such as the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index and its components , are subject to interobserver variability. The University of Córdoba Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index ( UCOASMI) is a validated composite index based on a motion video-capture system , UCOTrack. Our objective was to assess its reproducibility in clinical practice settings. We carried out an observational study of repeated measures in 3 centers. Video-capture systems were installed and adapted to clinical rooms. Patients with axSpA and stable disease were selected by consecutive stratified sampling ( disease duration , sex , and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI)). Intraobserver reliability of the UCOASMI and of conventional measures was tested 3-5 days apart. For interobserver reliability , 3 patients from each center were evaluated in the other centers , within 3-7 days. The intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC) were calculated. Thirty patients were included ( 73 % men , mean age 53 yrs , mean BASDAI 3.0). Interobserver and intraobserver ICC of the UCOASMI was 0.98. Conventional measurements showed lower but adequate reproducibility as well , except for interobserver reliability of lateral flexion ( 0.41) , cervical rotation ( 0.61) , and Schöber test ( 0.07) , and intraobserver reliability of tragus-to-wall distance ( 0.30). Reproducibility of the UCOASMI seems very high , and apparently more reliable than conventional measures of mobility.
