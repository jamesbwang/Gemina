  Defensins are small cysteine-rich cationic proteins that are ubiquitously present in both vertebrates and invertebrates and constitute the front line of host innate immunity. In the present study , a defensin-like antimicrobial peptide ( designed as RpdefB) was identified and characterized from the manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. The open reading frame of RpdefB encoded a 70-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 7.5 kDa and isoelectric point of 8.16. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis strongly suggested that RpdefB was a new member of the defensin family. In non-stimulated clams , RpdefB transcripts were constitutively expressed in all five tested tissues , especially in the hepatopancreas. After Vibrio<pathogen> anguillarum challenge , expression of RpdefB mRNA in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated at 6 h , 12 h and 72 h. The synthetic peptide RpdefB showed high antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacterium<pathogen> Vibrio<pathogen> splendidus. Moreover , membrane integrity analysis revealed that RpdefB increased the membrane permeability of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and then resulted in cell death. Overall , our results suggested that RpdefB played an important role in the elimination of invading bacterium<pathogen> , perhaps through membrane-disruptive activity.
