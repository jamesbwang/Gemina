  Young adulthood is a high-risk period for heavy drinking and binge eating , both of which can impact weight and lead to obesity. Examining motives for drinking alcohol and eating palatable foods may facilitate a more integrated understanding of these behaviors during the college years. The current study tested whether shared or distinct ( i.e. , behavior-specific) motivational mechanisms may explain the occurrence of reward-driven drinking and eating in young adults. A sample of college freshmen ( N = 103) stratified by sex , race/ethnicity , and heavy drinking status were selected to participate. Participants completed questionnaires measuring alcohol use , eating behavior , and motives assessed by the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised and Palatable Eating Motives Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA) tested whether drinking and eating motives were better represented as single latent motives , or two behavior-specific motives. Structural equation modeling ( SEM) was used to test the association between motivational factors and behaviors. Behavior-specific CFA models demonstrated stronger model fit and higher factor loadings than single motive models. SEM models indicated that eating to cope with negative emotions , to enhance positive experiences , to obtain social reinforcement , and to conform with peers were significantly associated with binge eating ( p values < .001). Enhancement and social drinking motives were significantly associated with number of weekly drinks ( p values < .001). While motives for drinking alcohol and eating palatable foods may satisfy common goals , findings suggest motivational mechanisms may be behavior-specific. Enhancement and social motives may be important factors to target in prevention programs for both drinking and binge eating.
