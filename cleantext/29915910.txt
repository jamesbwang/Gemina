  Microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes ( T2DM) , including diabatic retinopathy ( DR) , diabetic kidney disease ( DKD) , diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN) are the leading causes of visual loss , end-stage renal disease or amputation , while the current therapies are still unsatisfactory. Chinese medicine ( CM) has been widely used for treating diabetic mellitus. However , most of the previous studies focused on the single complication. The role of CM treatment in T2DM patients with 2 or multiple microvascular complications is not clear. To appraise the curative effect of CM in T2DM patients with 2 or multiple microvascular complications , and to compare the effects of stationary treatment and individualized treatment in T2DM patients with microvascular complications. This trial will be an 8-center , randomized , controlled study with 8 parallel groups. A total of 432 patients will be randomized to 8 groups: DR study group ( 32 cases) and a corresponding control group ( 32 cases) , DR+DKD study group ( 64 cases) and a corresponding control group ( 64 cases) , DR+DPN study group ( 64 cases) and a corresponding control group ( 64 cases) , DR+DKD+DPN study group ( 56 cases) and a corresponding control group ( 56 cases). The control group will receive stationary treatment , and the study group will receive individualized treatment based on CM syndrome<disease> differentiation in addition to stationary treatment. The study duration will be 50 weeks , comprising a 2-week run-in period , 24 weeks of intervention , and 24 weeks of follow-up. The outcomes will assess efficacy of treatment , improvement in CM symptoms , safety assessments , adherence to the treatment , and adverse events. This study will provide evidence of evidence-based medicine for CM treatment in two or multiple microvascular complications caused by T2DM. ( Registration No. ChiCTR-IPR-15007072).
