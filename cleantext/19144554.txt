  The risk of autoimmune diseases ( AD) in patients with Turner Syndrome<disease> ( TS) is twice higher than in the general female population and four times higher than in the male population. The causes of the increased incidence of AD in TS are still under discussion. We hypothesized the presence of a specific humoral , cellular , and regulatory T cell ( Treg) immunity profile which predisposes to AD , disorders of immunity , and disorders of immune regulation. The study encompassed 37 girls with TS and with no signs of infection. The control group included 11 healthy girls with no hormonal disorders. A medical history focused on AD and immunity disorders was taken from all participants. The levels of: immunoglobulins IgG , IgA , IgM , total lymphocytes , lymphocytes subpopulations CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , CD19 + , natural killer cells , Treg cells ( CD4 + CD25 + CD127- FOXP3 +) , anti-inflammatory cytokines ( interleukin-10 , transforming growth factor-β) , anti-nuclear antibodies , glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD65 Abs) , anti-thyroid peroxidase ( anti-TPO Ab) , and anti-thyroglobulin ( anti-TG Ab) autoantibodies were determined in each participant. The mean age and BMI in the TS group and in controls were comparable ( 11.9 ± 4.1 vs. 12.5 ± 4.0 years; 19.2 ± 3.4 vs. 19.7 ± 4.6 , TS predisposes to AD , especially if associated with coexisting iXq. Our preliminary findings show that patients with TS may present a specific profile of humoral and cellular immunity markers , different from healthy girls.
