  Reducing the fluctuation of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> has recently been recognized as a potential target for improving management of hypertension to prevent cardiovascular events , particularly for strokes. Some randomized controlled trials demonstrated that amlodipine can effectively reduce blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> as a well-established , long-acting calcium channel blocker ( CCB). However , few data are available for amlodipine on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> variability ( BPV) in China in a real-world setting. This study aimed to assess the effect of amlodipine versus other CCB antihypertensive agents on BPV. A retrospective propensity score-matched analysis was conducted , which retrieved the encounter data from 5582 hypertensive inpatients ( with a median age of 69 , female percentage of 48 % , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ≥ 40 and < 150 mmHg; systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) ≥ 70 mmHg and < 260 mmHg) , who had taken at least one antihypertensive agent and completed at least three SBP measurements during the visit. International Classification of Diseases was used to identify the hypertensive patients. BPV was calculated with standard deviation ( SD) and coefficient of variation ( CV) of SBP during a single inpatient visit. The Propensity Score Matching was used to balance the cohort of patients prescribed amlodipine or other CCBs. A series of appropriate statistical tests were applied to the propensity score-matched samples to examine the different effects on BPV. Additionally , the hypertensive patients with comorbidity such as coronary artery disease , diabetes mellitus , myocardial infarction , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and chronic kidney disease were analyzed. For the hypertensive patients ( n = 1756 , for each cohort) , patients prescribed amlodipine showed lower BPV than patients prescribed other CCBs ( 12.90 vs 13.76 mmHg , p < 0.05 ( SD) and 9.47 vs 10.06 , p < 0.05 ( CV)). For the hypertensive patients with comorbidity ( n = 1080 , for each cohort) , patients prescribed amlodipine had lower BPV than patients prescribed other CCBs as well ( 13.24 vs 14.23 mmHg , p < 0.05 ( SD) and 9.66 vs 10.28 , p < 0.05 ( CV)). amlodipine was associated with lower BPV than other CCBs for both hypertensive patients and hypertensive patients with comorbidity.
