  To examine the relationship between inflammation-related lifestyle factors and long interspersed nuclear element-1 ( LINE-1) DNA methylation , and test for interaction by gene variants involved in one-carbon metabolism. The study population consisted of 280 individuals undergoing colonoscopy screening. Multivariable linear regression was employed to examine associations of physical activity , BMI and NSAID use with LINE-1 DNA methylation and interactions with MTR and MTHFR gene variants. The highest quartile of physical activity compared with the lowest was associated with higher LINE-1 DNA methylation ( p = 0.005). Long-term NSAID use and a normal BMI were associated with increased LINE-1 DNA methylation among individuals with the variant MTR allele ( p = 0.02; p = 0.03). This study provides evidence that inflammation-related exposures may influence LINE-1 DNA methylation.
