  Inconsistent results have been reported concerning the relationships between SNS usage and loneliness. The current two-wave panel study with a one year interval examined the possibility of reciprocal and curvilinear relationships between active public Facebook use and adolescents ' social/emotional loneliness. Belgian adolescents from fifteen high schools participated ( N = 1188 , 55 % male). The results showed a U-shaped relationship between ( 1) active Facebook use and social/emotional loneliness and ( 2) emotional loneliness and active Facebook use. Specifically , active Facebook use predicted decreased social/emotional loneliness among low to moderate users , while among heavy users , increased levels of social/emotional loneliness were predicted by active Facebook use. Emotional loneliness predicted higher active Facebook use among lonely adolescents. At the same time , emotional loneliness predicted decreased active Facebook use among adolescents who did not feel lonely. These findings stress to consider different types of loneliness , and reciprocal and curvilinear relationships in future social media research.
