  The adsorption and dissociation of O2 and the adsorption of O * adatoms over strained Pt ( 111) surfaces have been systematically studied using density functional theory calculations. When the applied bilateral strain ranges from compressive ( -5 %) to tensile ( 5 %) , the adsorption strengths of O and O2 at various sites can be varied substantially by 0.3 to 0.9 eV. Moreover , the preferred adsorption site of O2 also changes from tbt to tfb when tensile strain is larger than 3 %. The activation barrier of O2 dissociation can be significantly varied by nearly 0.4 eV from -3 % to 3 % strain. Meanwhile , the combination of O * adatoms and the applied strain can pull the Pt atom out of the surface and result in dramatic surface buckling. The z direction shift of a Pt atom sandwiched by two fcc O * adatoms is over 0.45 Ã… when compressive strain goes beyond -2 %. The abnormal non-linear responses of O adsorption strength and the lateral O-O interaction to strain all arise from the up-buckled Pt atom. We show that strain is a very powerful tool for tuning the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of oxygen adsorption , dissociation and surface bucking of metal surfaces , which are crucial for understanding the catalytic properties and initial oxidation of transition metal based catalysts.
