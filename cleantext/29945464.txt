  Aim To identify factors that may be predictors of the outcome of a detoxification treatment in medication-overuse headache<symptom> Methods Consecutive patients entering a detoxification program in six centres in Europe and Latin America were evaluated and followed up for 6 months. We evaluated anxious and depressive symptomatology ( though patients with severe psychiatric comorbidity were excluded) , quality of life , headache-related disability , headache<symptom> characteristics , and prophylaxis upon discharge. Results Of the 492 patients who completed the six-month follow up , 407 ceased overuse following the detoxification ( non overusers) , another 23 ceased overuse following detoxification but relapsed during the follow-up. In the 407 non-overusers , headache<symptom> acquired an episodic pattern in 287 subjects ( responders). At the multivariate analyses , lower depression<symptom> scores ( odds ratio = 0.891; p = 0.001) predicted ceasing overuse. The primary headache<symptom> diagnosis- migraine with respect to tension-type headache<symptom> ( odds ratio = 0.224; p = 0.001) or migraine plus tension-type headache<symptom> ( odds ratio = 0.467; p = 0.002)- and the preventive treatment with flunarizine ( compared to no such treatment) ( odds ratio = 0.891; p = 0.001) predicted being a responder. A longer duration of chronic<symptom> headache<symptom> ( odds ratio = 1.053; p = 0.032) predicted relapse into overuse. Quality of life and disability were not associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusions Though exploratory in nature , these findings point to specific factors that are associated with a positive outcome of medication-overuse headache<symptom> management , while identifying others that may be associated with a negative outcome. Evaluation of the presence/absence of these factors may help to optimize the management of this challenging groups of chronic<symptom> headache<symptom> sufferers.
