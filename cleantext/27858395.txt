  The accuracy of online medical information is variable. A 2014 Cochrane review did not support a robust improvement in male infertility<symptom> after antioxidant supplementation. Many subfertile men take vitamins in hopes of improving their fertility. We sought to evaluate the content of online information for male fertility vitamins , and compare this with the published literature. We searched Google to assess online information regarding vitamins and male infertility<symptom>. Websites were evaluated for authorship , content , claims and validity. We then reviewed the Recommended Daily Allowance and upper tolerable intake level for each vitamin , and compared this with the supplements actual content. Four websites were posted by an academic source , 7 private clinic , 31 industry , 8 were patient blogs and 50 other sources. Reproductive claims made by websites included: Improved sperm count: 65; improved pregnancy rates: 42; improved live birth rates: 9; healthier offspring: 18. Overall , 76 websites claimed some improvement in semen parameters; 85 claimed some improved reproductive outcome. 26 websites were supported by peer-reviewed literature. None of the supplements had more than the upper tolerable intake level of any of the vitamins , but several were over the RDA , most commonly zinc , vitamin B12 and selenium. Many websites claim improvements in a variety of male reproductive outcomes after vitamin supplementation. These are often not supported by the medical literature. We need to provide evidence-based information to patients so that they can have realistic expectations of the benefits that vitamins may have on male reproductive outcomes.
