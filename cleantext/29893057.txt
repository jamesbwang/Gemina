  The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate if animated cartoons could increase the cooperation of young children with asthma during the delivery of their inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS). Subjects were children aged 6-47 months having a physician diagnosis of asthma , who required an ICS therapy delivered through a pMDI/spacer twice a day for at least 2 months. Families who reported on a questionnaire that their child was frequently crying or moving during treatment delivery were asked to participate in a prospective , cross-over , randomized study. After a first week of run-in , children watched alternatively , during the delivery of ICS , either an animated cartoon for 7 days and a black screen video for another 7 days. The main outcome was the median percentage of time of non-cooperation , defined by the length of time the child was crying and/or moving divided by the length of time required for delivering ICS. Parents of 50 children out of 113 ( 44 %) reported that their child was frequently crying or moving during treatment delivery. Among these 50 children , 11 ( 22 %) completed the study. The median percentages of time of non-cooperation ( IQR 1-3) were 0 % ( 0-3) and 56 % ( 40-97) during the distraction and control periods , respectively , in the first group , and 100 % ( 98-100) and 0 % ( 0-5) during the control and distraction periods , respectively , in the second group. Animated cartoons increased cooperation up to 97 % ( 55-100 %) ( P = 0.008). Bad cooperation among young children with asthma during the delivery of their treatment can be dramatically improved by the use of animated cartoons.
