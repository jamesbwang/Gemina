  The ability to effectively cope with stress is a critical determinant of disease susceptibility. The lateral habenula ( LHb) and the endocannabinoid ( ECB) system have independently been shown to be involved in the selection of stress coping strategies , yet the role of ECB signaling in the LHb remains unknown. Using a battery of complementary techniques in rats , we examined the localization of type-1 cannabinoid receptors ( CB Electron microscopy studies revealed CB Alterations in LHb ECB signaling may be relevant for development of stress-related pathologies in which LHb dysfunction and stress-coping impairments are hallmark symptoms.
