  Epigenetic inheritance of acquired traits is widespread among eukaryotes , but how and to what extent such information is transgenerationally inherited is still unclear. The patterns of programmed DNA elimination in ciliates are epigenetically and transgenerationally inherited , and it has been proposed that small RNAs , which shuttle between the germline and the soma , regulate this epigenetic inheritance. In this study , we test the existence and role of such small-RNA-mediated communication by epigenetically disturbing the pattern of DNA elimination in Tetrahymena. We show that the pattern of DNA elimination is , indeed , determined by the selective turnover of small RNAs , which is induced by the interaction between germline-derived small RNAs and the somatic genome. In addition , we show that DNA elimination of an element is regulated by small-RNA-mediated communication with other eliminated elements. By contrast , no evidence obtained thus far supports the notion that transfer of epigenetic information from the soma to the germline , if any , regulates DNA elimination. Our results indicate that small-RNA-mediated trans-nuclear and trans-element communication , in addition to unknown information in the germline genome , contributes to determining the pattern of DNA elimination.
