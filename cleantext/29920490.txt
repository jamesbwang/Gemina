  To investigate the effects of bevacizumab and ranibizumab in the treatment of type 1 retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP) affecting zone 1. Files of the patients who received intravitreal bevacizumab ( IVB) or ranibizumab ( IVR) treatment for ROP affecting zone 1 were evaluated retrospectively. Spherical equivalent ( SE) and axial length ( AXL) measurements were performed at 1 year of adjusted age. Sixty-eight eyes of 37 patients were included in the study. All patients had initial disease regression but 6 patients ( 4 in the IVB , 2 in the IVR group) showed reactivation ( p = 0.679). The number of eyes with incomplete vascularization were 15 and 12 in the IVB and IVR groups , respectively ( p = 0.725). Mean AXL was 20.50 ± 0.99 mm in the IVB group and 19.30 ± 0.48 mm in the IVR group ( p < 0.001). Mean SE was -1.49 ± 2.38 dpt in the IVB group and 0.98 ± 2.18 dpt in the IVR group ( p < 0.001). Bevacizumab and ranibizumab showed similar effectiveness in the treatment of type 1 ROP affecting zone 1. The AXL was longer and SE was more myopic in eyes treated with IVB. This difference might be caused by the longer intravitreal half-life of bevacizumab than ranibizumab.
