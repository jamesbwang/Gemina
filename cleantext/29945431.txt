  Propofol and sufentanil target controlled infusion technology is used with increasing frequency. Drug interaction modelling , using clinical endpoints and processed electroencephalography helps determine optimal drug concentrations to assure adequate anesthesia. 60 patients were randomized to receive a constant concentration of sufentanil ( 0.25 ng/ml ( Group S0 .25) , 0.5 ng/ml ( Group S0 .5) , 0 ng/ml ( Group S0). Propofol was administered in steps of 0.5 μg/ml , up to 4 μg/ml. Processed EEG ( Bispectral Index , Narcotrend Index) and auditory evoked potentials ( composite A-Line autoregressive Index; cAAI) , were recorded simultaneously. Sufentanil-propofol interaction was assessed by Probit- and nonlinear regression analysis. Sufentanil had a dose-dependent synergistic effect on the effect-site concentration of propofol ( μg/ml) associated with a 50 % probability ( EC50) of loss of responsiveness to verbal command ( S0: 2.84 μg/ml , R2 0.773; S0 .25: 1.95 μg/ml , R2 0.862; S0 .5: 1.48 μg/ml , R2 0.887) and noxious stimulation ( S0: 3.46 μg/ml , R2 0.626 μg/ml; S0 .25: 2.17 μg/ml , R2 0.853; S0 .5: 1.69 μg/ml , R2 0.897). Non-linear regression analysis revealed a synergistic sufentanil effect on the propofol EC50 for BIS ( S0: 3.36 μg/ml , R2 0.79; S0 .25: 2.77 μg/ml , R2 0.86 μg/ml; S0 .5: 2.6 μg/ml , R2 0.84) , Narcotrend Index ( S0: 3.57 μg/ml , R2 0.66; S0 .25: 2.91 μg/ml , R2 0.70; S0 .5: 2.02 μg/ml , R2 0.51) and cAAI ( S0: 3.42 μg/ml , R2 0.59; S0 .25: 3.00 μg/ml , R2 0.63; S0 .5: 3.14 μg/ml , R2 0.59). Sufentanil has a synergistic effect on the clinically observed hypnotic properties of propofol. These findings apply also to the depth of hypnosis measured by the Bispectral Index , Narcotrend Index and cAAI.
