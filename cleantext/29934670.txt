  The bromodomain and extra-terminal ( BET) family of proteins provides a scaffolding platform for the recruitment and tethering of transcription factors to acetylated chromatin , thereby modulating gene expression. In this study , we evaluated the efficacy of the BET-inhibitor PFI-1 to diminish AR/AR-V 7 signaling and proliferation in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. Prostate-specific antigen and androgen receptor ( AR) protein were quantified by means of two commercial ELISAs. Transactivation of the AR , AR-V7 and Q641X was determined by reporter gene assays. Cell proliferation was measured using a colorimetric MTT-assay. PFI-1 dose-dependently inhibited transactivation of full-length AR ( non- mutated , i.e. , wild-type or point-mutated/promiscuous forms) without affecting their cellular protein levels. Moreover , PFI-1 was active against C-terminally truncated constitutively active ARs like AR-V7 and Q641X. Prostate cancer cells exhibiting a transcriptionally active AR-signaling complex ( LNCaP , 22Rv1) were more susceptible to the growth-inhibitory effects than the AR-negative PC-3 cells. The quinazolinone PFI-1 is a highly efficient inhibitor of AR-signaling-competent prostate cancer cells in vitro. PFI-1 could serve as a lead compound for the development of new therapeutics able to block AR/AR-V 7 signaling in advanced prostate cancer.
