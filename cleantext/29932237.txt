  Among bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs) , BMP-9 has been described as one with higher osteogenic potential. Here , we aimed at evaluating the effect of BMP-9 on the osteoblast differentiation of cells grown on titanium ( Ti) with nanotopography , a well-known osseoinductive surface. MC3T3-E1 cells were grown either in absence or presence of BMP-9 ( 20 nM) on Ti with nanotopography ( Ti-Nano) or machined Ti ( Ti-Machined) for up to 21 days to evaluate the gene expression of RUNX2 , osterix , osteocalcin , bone sialoprotein , SMAD6 and SMAD4 , protein expression of SMAD4 , ALP activity and extracellular matrix mineralization. As expected BMP-9 increased osteoblast differentiation irrespective of Ti surface topography; however , the cells grown on Ti-Nano were more responsible to BMP-9 compared with cells grown on Ti-machined. This could be , at least in part , due to the fact that Ti-Nano may act on both ways , by increasing the activation ( SMAD4) and decreasing the inhibition ( SMAD6) of the signaling pathway triggered by BMP-9 , while Ti-Machined only decrease the inhibition ( SMAD6) of this pathway. In conclusion , the combination of the osteogenic potential of BMP-9 with the osseoinductive capacity of Ti-Nano could be a promising strategy to favor the osseointegration of Ti implants.
