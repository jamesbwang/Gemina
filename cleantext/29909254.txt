  These Guidelines for the Cleaning and Sterilization of Intraocular Surgical Instruments were written by the Ophthalmic Instrument Cleaning and Sterilization ( OICS) Task Force , comprised of representatives of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery , the American Academy of Ophthalmology , and the Outpatient Ophthalmic Surgery Society. These consensus subspecialty guidelines include evidence-based recommendations regarding issues that may be unique to the cleaning and sterilization of intraocular instrumentation. A newly published OICS Task Force study supports the safety of common short-cycle instrument processing practices for sequential same-day anterior segment surgery. Other studies substantiate the risk of toxic anterior segment syndrome<disease> from routine use of enzymatic detergent , whose microscopic residues are difficult to eliminate from intraocular instrumentation. Finally , based on published international outcomes and endophthalmitis<disease> rates , future studies should critically evaluate a variety of operating room protocols that may increase cost , waste , and carbon footprint , without any actual safety benefit.
