  Our primary aim was to compare the morphology and morphokinetics on inter- and intra-observer agreement for blastocyst with known implantation outcome. Our secondary aim was to validate the morphokinetic parameters ' ability to predict pregnancy using a previous published selection algorithm , and to compare this to standard morphology assessments. Two embryologists made independent blinded annotations on two occasions using time-lapse images and morphology evaluations using the Gardner Schoolcraft criteria of 99 blastocysts with known implantation outcome. Inter- and intra-observer agreement was calculated and compared using the two methods. The embryos were grouped based on their morphological score , and on their morphokinetic class using a previous published selection algorithm. The implantation rates for each group was calculated and compared. There was moderate agreement for morphology , with agreement on the same embryo score in 55 of 99 cases. The highest agreement rate was found for expansion grade , followed by trophectoderm and inner cell mass. Correlation with pregnancy was inconclusive. For morphokinetics , almost perfect agreement was found for early and late embryo development events , and strong agreement for day-2 and day-3 events. When applying the selection algorithm , the embryo distributions were uneven , and correlation to pregnancy was inconclusive. Time-lapse annotation is consistent and accurate , but our external validation of a previously published selection algorithm was unsuccessful.
