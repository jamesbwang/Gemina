  Farletuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting human folate receptor alpha , which is being developed as an anti-cancer drug. A non-human primate reproductive study was conducted to evaluate whether it could cause any embryonic or fetal abnormalities. Farletuzumab was administered intravenously to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys ( n = 16/group) at doses of 0 or 67.5 mg/kg once weekly during gestation day ( GD) 20 through 97. C-section was performed on GD100 Â± 2 , and fetuses were evaluated for morphologic ( external , visceral and skeletal) effects. No farletuzumab-related changes were observed in maternal animals or fetuses , which are supported by the fact that farletuzumab has no effects on cellular uptake of folate. These data support the potential use of farletuzumab for oncologic indications during pregnancy.
