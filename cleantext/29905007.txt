  Breast cancer ( BC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. It recently was proven that miRNAs play a critical role in BC development. The use of natural agents for control of cancer by modulating miRNAs is promising. Oleuropein is a natural polyphenolic agent with anti-neoplastic properties and is well tolerated by humans. This study was undertaken to determine the therapeutic effects of oleuropein through modulation of master oncomiRs ( miR-21 and miR-155) in BC cells. The present study provides the first link between miRNA and oleuropein as a mechanism in BC. MCF-7 cells were tested with and without oleuropein and the cell viability , apoptosis , and migration were examined. The effect of oleuropein on miR-21 and miR-155 expression was assessed through qRT-PCR. It was found that oleuropein induced apoptosis and retarded cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner in the human MCF7 BC cell line. It was observed that oleuropein significantly decreased expression of both miR-21 and miR-155 over time in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that oleuropein is a potential therapeutic and preventive agent for BC. Oleuropein exhibits an anti-cancer effect by modulation of tumor suppressor gene expression , which is targeted by oncomiRs.
