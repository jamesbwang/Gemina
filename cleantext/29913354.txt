  Individuals with trans-tibial amputation show a greater peak prosthetic ankle power ( push- off) when using energy storing and returning ( ESAR) prosthetic feet as compared to solid-ankle cushion-heel feet. ESAR feet further contribute to the users ' body support and thus limit prosthetic ankle motion. To improve ankle motion , articulating prosthetic feet have been introduced. However , articulating feet may diminish push-off. Does a novel prosthetic foot , with a serial layout of carbon fibre leaf springs , connected by a multi-centre joint construction , have advantages in kinematics and kinetics over a conventional ESAR prosthetic foot? > METHODS: Eleven individuals with unilateral trans-tibial amputation were fitted with the novel foot ( NF) and a conventional ESAR Foot ( CF) and underwent 3D gait analysis. As an additional power estimate of the prosthetic ankle , a unified , deformable , segment model approach was applied. Eleven matched individuals without impairments served as a reference. The NF shows an effective prosthetic ankle range of motion that is closer to a physiologic ankle range of motion , at 31.6 ° as compared to 15.2 ° with CF ( CF vs. NF p = 0.003/ NF vs. Reference p = 0.171) without reducing the maximum prosthetic ankle joint moment. Furthermore , the NF showed a great increase in prosthetic ankle power ( NF 2.89 W/kg vs. CF 1.48 W/kg CF vs. NF p = < 0.001) and a reduction of 19 % in the peak knee varus moment and 13 % in vertical ground reaction forces on the sound side for NF in comparison to CF. The NF shows that serial carbon fibre leaf springs , connected by a multi-centre joint construction gives a larger ankle joint range of motion and higher ankle power than a conventional carbon fibre structure alone. Consequently load is taken off the contralateral limb , as measured by the decrease in vertical ground reaction forces and peak knee varus moment.
