  Investigations of teratogenic effects of drugs generally involve testing the drug on animals and zebrafish embryo is a commonly used animal model for that purpose. In these studies , cardiovascular function of the animals needs to be evaluated to reveal the influence of exposure on the development of the cardiovascular system as well as on the growth of the whole animal. Here , relevant microscopy imaging and analysis protocols are described to calculate a variety of hemodynamic parameters for zebrafish embryos exposed to clinical drugs.
