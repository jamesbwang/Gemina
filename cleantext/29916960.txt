  In North<pathogen> America , women have lower engagement across the HIV<pathogen> cascade of care compared with men. Among women living with HIV<pathogen> ( WLWH) in Canada , we measured the prevalence and correlates of attrition across cascade stages overall , and by key sub-populations. We analyzed baseline survey data regarding six nested stages of the HIV<pathogen> cascade among 1,424 WLWH enrolled in the Canadian HIV<pathogen> Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study ( CHIWOS) , including: linked to care , retained in care , initiated antiretroviral therapy ( ART) , current ART use , ART adherence ( â‰¥ 90 %) , and viral suppression ( < 50 copies/mL). Logistic regression identified factors associated with attrition at each stage. Overall , 98 % of WLWH were linked to care; 96 % retained; 88 % initiated ART; 83 % were currently on ART; and , among those on ART , 68 % were adherent and 72 % were virally suppressed , with substantial variability by sub-population ( 49 % -84 %). The largest attrition occurred between current ART use and adherence ( -17 %) , with the greatest losses among Indigenous women ( -25 %) , women who use illicit drugs ( -32 %) , and women incarcerated in the past year ( -45 %). Substantial attrition also occurred between linkage to care and ART initiation ( -11 %) , with the greatest losses among women 16-29 years ( -20 %) and with unstable housing ( -27 %). Factors independently associated with attrition at viral suppression included household annual income , racial discrimination , incarceration history , age , and resilience. Overall , 28 % of WLWH were lost across the HIV<pathogen> care cascade , with significant differences by stage , sub-population , and social inequities. Targeted interventions are needed to improve women 's retention across the cascade.
