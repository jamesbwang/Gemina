  Complications related to peritoneal dialysis ( PD) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD) including intraperitoneal rupture of renal cyst<disease> , hernia , membrane failure , and peritonitis<disease> have been reported. However , long-term clinical outcomes of ADPKD patients on PD remain unclear. We performed this meta-analysis to assess the risks of death , technique failure , and peritonitis<disease> in ADPKD patients on PD. A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane databases from inception through October 2017 to identify studies that evaluated outcomes of ADPKD patients on PD including the risks of death , technique failure , and peritonitis<disease> Non-ADPKD patients on PD were used as controls. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using random-effect , generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Twelve cohort studies with a total of 14,673 patients on PD ( 931 ADPKD and 13,742 non-ADPKD patients) were enrolled. Compared with non-ADPKD status , ADPKD was associated with significantly decreased mortality risk with pooled OR of 0.68 ( 95 % CI , 0.53-0.86 , I Compared with non-ADPKD patients on PD , our study demonstrates that ADPKD patients on PD have 0.68-fold decreased mortality risk. There are no associations of ADPKD status with the risks of technique failure or peritonitis<disease> This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
