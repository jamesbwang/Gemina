  Al/TiO ₂ composite film was successfully deposited on polyester fabrics by using magnetron sputtering techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) and X-ray diffraction ( XRD) were used to examine the deposited films on the fabrics , and the structural colors and anti-ultraviolet property of fabrics were also analyzed. The results indicated that polyester fabrics coated with Al/TiO ₂ composite films achieved structural colors. The reactive sputtering times of TiO ₂ films in Al/TiO ₂ composite films were 10 min , 12 min , 18 min , 20 min , 26 min , 27 min , 30 min and 45 min , respectively , the colors of corresponding fabrics were bluish violet , blue , cyan , green , yellow , yellowish red , orange and blue-green , which was consistent with the principle of the thin film interference. The structure of the TiO ₂ film in Al/TiO ₂ composite films was non-crystalline , though the fabrics were heated and maintained at the temperature of 200 & deg; C. The anti-ultraviolet property of the fabrics deposited with Al/TiO ₂ composite films were excellent because of the effect of Al/TiO ₂ composite films.
