  Abiraterone acetate ( AA) plus prednisone is an approved treatment of advanced prostate cancer ( PCa). Autophagy is linked to drug resistance in numerous types of cancers. We hypothesized , that upregulation of autophagy is one of the mechanisms by which PCa cells survive AA anti-tumor treatment and therefore evaluated the potential effect of a combination with autophagy inhibition. Human PCa LNCaP cell lines were cultured in steroid-free medium and treated with AA. Autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine , chloroquine and ATG5 siRNA knock-down. Cell viability and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy , and autophagy was monitored by immunohistochemistry , AUTOdot and Western blotting. Western blot revealed upregulation of ATG5 and LC3 II with a reduction of p62 protein expression in AA-treated cells , indicating upregulation of autophagy. These data were supported by results obtained with immunocytochemistry and AUTOdot assays. Using flow cytometry , we showed that combining AA with autophagy inhibition significantly impaired cell viability ( 1.3-1.6-fold , p < 0.001) and increased apoptosis ( 1.4-1.5-fold , p < 0.001) compared to AA treatment alone. AA activates autophagy as a cytoprotective mechanism in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and targeting of autophagy enhances the antitumor effect of the compound.
