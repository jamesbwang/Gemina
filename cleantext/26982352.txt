  The origin of Langerhans cells ( LCs) , which are skin epidermis-resident macrophages , remains unclear. Current lineage tracing of LCs largely relies on the promoter-Cre-LoxP system , which often gives rise to contradictory conclusions with different promoters. Thus , reinvestigation with an improved tracing method is necessary. Here , using a laser-mediated temporal-spatial resolved cell labeling method , we demonstrated that most adult LCs originated from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta ( VDA) , an equivalent to the mouse aorta , gonads , and mesonephros ( AGM) , where both hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) and non-HSC progenitors are generated. Further fine-fate mapping analysis revealed that the appearance of LCs in adult zebrafish was correlated with the development of HSCs , but not T cell progenitors. Finally , we showed that the appearance of tissue-resident macrophages in the brain , liver , heart , and gut of adult zebrafish was also correlated with HSCs. Thus , the results of our study challenged the EMP-origin theory for LCs.
