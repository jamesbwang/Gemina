  Stevens-Johnson Syndrome<disease> ( SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis ( TEN) are serious mucocutaneous reactions. In Spain , the epidemiology and resulting expenses of these diseases are not well established. Retrospective descriptive study using the Minimum Basic Data Set ( CMBD in Spanish) in patients admitted to hospitals of the National Health System between 2010 and 2015 with a diagnosis of SJS and TEN ( combination of ICD-9 codes 695.13 , 695.14 , and 695.15 , along with length of hospital stay). A total of 1,468 patients were recorded , 773 were men ( 52.7 %). The mean age ( ± SD) was 52.25 ± 26.15 years. The mean incidence rate for all diagnoses was 5.19 cases per million person-years ( 2.96 in SJS , 0.31 in SJS/TEN and 1.90 in TEN). 148 patients died ( 10.1 %) , 47 due to SJS ( 5.6 %) and 90 ( 16.7 %) due to TEN. The estimated total medical cost of SJS , SJS/TEN , and TEN in Spain was $ 11.576.456,18 , and the average medical cost per patient was $ 7.885,86 ± $ 11.686,26 , higher medical cost in TEN ( $ 10352.46 ± $ 16319,93) than in SJS ( $ 6340,05 ± $ 7078,85) ( p < 0.001). Older patients have a more severe clinical picture and higher mortality rates. The overall mortality of both diseases is approximately 10 % , and clinical diagnosis and age were the variables with the greatest influence on mortality. This study describes a stable incidence and a similar prevalence to other European countries. Additionally , the data show a high cost due to hospitalizations. Finally , the CMBD could be a good system of epidemiological analysis for the study of infrequent diseases and hospital management of conditions such as SJS and TEN.
