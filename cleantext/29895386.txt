  To validate the diagnostic accuracy of Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System ( PI-RADS) version 2 in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer ( csPCa , Gleason score â‰¥ 7) on prebiopsy biparametric MRI ( bpMRI) in patients with different prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) levels. This retrospective study included 184 patients who underwent prebiopsy bpMRI followed by transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy between June 2015 and February 2017. Reader 1 performed a combination of systematic and targeted biopsy with cognitive fusion after reviewing bpMRI and reader 2 reviewed the bpMRIs retrospectively. PI-RADS categories 4 and 5 were considered positive , and the results of the biopsy were considered the reference standard. Diagnostic performance of PI-RADS of bpMRI was evaluated in two PSA groups with a PSA cut-off level of 10 ng/ml and compared to PSA and the PSA density using receiver operating characteristics ( ROC) curve analysis. csPCa was diagnosed in 24 of 123 patients ( 19.5 %) and 26 of 61 patients ( 42.6 %) in the low and high PSA groups , respectively. A PI-RADS v2 category by either readers 1 or 2 had a significantly better performance to detect csPCa than PSA in both PSA groups. In the high PSA group , only one csPCa was missed by reader 2 , but none by reader 1. In the low PSA group , readers 1 and 2 were unable to detect seven and five of the 24 csPCas , respectively. Prebiopsy bpMRI has good performance for detecting csPCa in the high PSA group but may miss small-volume csPCa in the low PSA group.
