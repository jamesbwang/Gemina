  Opportunistic citizen science ( CS) programs allow volunteers to report species observations from anywhere , at any time , and can assemble large volumes of historic and current data at faster rates than more coordinated programs with standardized data collection. This can quickly provide large amounts of species distributional data , but whether this focus on participation comes at a cost in data quality is not clear. Although automated and expert vetting can increase data reliability , there is no guarantee that opportunistic data will do anything more than confirm information from professional surveys. Here , we use eButterfly , an opportunistic CS program , and a comparable dataset of professionally collected observations , to measure the amount of new distributional species information that opportunistic CS generates. We also test how well opportunistic CS can estimate regional species richness for a large group of taxa ( > 300 butterfly species) across a broad area. We find that eButterfly contributes new distributional information for > 80 % of species , and that opportunistically submitting observations allowed volunteers to spot species ~ 35 days earlier than professionals. Although eButterfly did a relatively poor job at predicting regional species richness by itself ( detecting only about 35-57 % of species per region) , it significantly contributed to regional species richness when used with the professional dataset ( adding ~ 3 species that had gone undetected in professional surveys per region). Overall , we find that the opportunistic CS model can provide substantial complementary species information when used alongside professional survey data. Our results suggest that data from opportunistic CS programs in conjunction with professional datasets can strongly increase the capacity of researchers to estimate species richness , and provide unique information on species distributions and phenologies that are relevant to the detection of the biological consequences of global change.
