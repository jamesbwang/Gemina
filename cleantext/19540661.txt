  The aim of this study is to make a comparative evaluation on association of PSCArs2294008 C/T polymorphism with the risk of bladder cancer in Bai , Dai , and Han people in China. A potential mechanism of the T allele risk was also investigated. T allele increased the occurring risk of bladder cancer in Han ( OR 1.34; 95 % CI 1.17-1.69) , Dai , ( OR 1.33; 95 % CI 1.12-1.70) , and Bai ( OR 1.14; 95 % CI 1.08-1.57) people. T genotype was also observed to associate with invasive bladder cancer in all the three populations ( Bai , OR 1.15 , 95 % CI 1.07-1.87; Dai , OR 1.17 , 95 % CI 1.05-2.23; Han , OR 1.22 , 95 % CI 1.10-2.09). PSCA m-RNA levels in T genotype bladder cancer tissues were significantly lower than those in C genotype. An enhancement of PSCA m-RNA level by over-expressing C or T genotype in bladder cancer cells both decreased the cell proliferation and migration , but not affected cell cycle. The increased cell apoptasis due to the over-expression of the two variants was observed. Those change of cell proliferation , migration , and apoptasis was more remarkable in over-expressed C genotype cells than those in over-expressed T genotype. T genotype was genetically high risk to the occurrence of bladder cancer. The decreased PSCA m-RNA levels were involved in the progress of bladder cancer. T allele takes more responsibility for PSCA m-RNA down-regulation to promote cell proliferation and migration and hinder cell apoptasis , thus leading to a higher risk.
