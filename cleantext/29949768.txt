  Netrin-G ligand 2 ( NGL-2)/ LRRC4 , implicated in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia , is a leucine-rich repeat-containing postsynaptic adhesion molecule that interacts intracellularly with the excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 and trans-synaptically with the presynaptic adhesion molecule netrin-G2. Functionally , NGL-2 regulates excitatory synapse development and synaptic transmission. However , whether it regulates synaptic plasticity and disease-related specific behaviors is not known. Here , we report that mice lacking NGL-2 ( Lrrc4
