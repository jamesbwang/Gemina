  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the role of CDKN1A in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). Related gene expression data screened from Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO) were processed with network analysis. Protein-protein interaction was analyzed through string database. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) was used to measure mRNA and microRNA expressions. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were tested by MTT assay and flow cytometry respectively. Transwell migration and invasion assay was used to test cell migration and invasion. CDKN1A screened by bioinformatics methods showed differential expression in RA cells compared with healthy controls ( HC) , and was at an important position in protein-protein interaction network of RA. Compared with HC group , CDKN1A was down-regulated in human RA synovium tissues and human fibroblast-like synoviocytes ( HFLS). Contrary to CDKN1A silencing , CDKN1A overexpression significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HFLS-RA , arrested HFLS-RA in G0/G1 phase , and down-regulated the expressions of TNFα and IL6 while up-regulated the expression of IL10. CDKN1A overexpression could also suppress pSTAT1 expression. MiR-146a , highly expressed in RA tissues , could negatively regulate CDKN1A. Anti-146a suppressed cell proliferation and invasion , and at the same time enhanced IL10 expression but inhibited IL6 , TNFα and pSTAT1 expression. The results indicated that CDKN1A overexpression , which could be enhanced by miR-146a suppression , inhibited the proliferation , invasion in HFLS-RA. This was probably a result of suppressed pSTAT1 , IL6 and TNFα expression and enhanced IL10 expression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
