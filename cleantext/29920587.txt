  The indole ring regioisomeric methoxy-1-n-pentyl-3- ( 1-naphthoyl)- indoles represent indole ring-substituted analogs of the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018. The electron ionization mass spectra show equivalent regioisomeric major fragments resulting from cleavage of the groups attached to the central indole nucleus. The characteristic ( M-17) + fragment ion at m/z 354 resulting from the loss of OH group is significant in the mass spectra of all four compounds. Fragmentation of the naphthoyl and/or pentyl groups yields the cations at m/z 314 , 300 , 244 and 216. The vapor-phase infrared spectra provide a number of characteristic absorption bands to identify the individual isomers. Gas chromatographic separations on a capillary column containing a film of trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane ( Rtx-200) provided excellent resolution of these compounds , their precursor indoles and intermediate pentylindoles. The elution order appears related to the degree of crowding of indole ring substituents.
