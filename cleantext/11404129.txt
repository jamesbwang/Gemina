  Few studies have reported predictive factors of outcome after pulmonary endarterectomy ( PEA) in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine factors influencing mortality and predictors of hemodynamic improvement after PEA. A total of 383 consecutive patients who underwent PEA between January 2005 and December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Among them , 150 were fully reevaluated 7.5 ± 1 months after PEA by NYHA class , 6-minute walk distance ( 6MWD) , percentage of predicted carbon monoxide transfer factor ( TLCO) and right heart catheterisation. Mortality rates at 1 month , 1 year and 3 years were 2.8 % , 6.9 % and 7.5 % , respectively. Preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR) independently predicted 1-month , 1- and 3-year mortality and age predicted mortality at 1 year and 3 years. Significant improvement in NYHA class and 6MWD were observed and PVR decreased from 773 ± 353 to 307 ± 221 dyn.sec.cm-5 ( p < 0.001). In 96 patients ( 64 %) , PVR decreased by at least 50 % and/or was reduced to lower than 250 dyn.sec.cm-5. Preoperative cardiac output ( CO) and TLCO predicted hemodynamic improvement. PEA is associated with an excellent long-term survival and a marked improvement in clinical status and hemodynamics. Some preoperative factors including PVR , CO and TLCO can predict postoperative outcomes.
