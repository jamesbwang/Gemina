  Combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir ± ribavirin ( 3DDA ± RBV) therapy is shown to be effective in HCV genotype 1 ( GT1) infected patients. However , sparse data exist in patients who failed previous boceprevir or telaprevir based therapies. Real life efficacy and safety of this combination were evaluated in HCV GT1b infected patients ( mostly cirrhotics) with compensated liver disease who failed previous boceprevir or telaprevir based therapies more than a year before. Data of previous protease inhibitor failure patients , treated with 3DAA + RBV for 12 weeks ( GT1b and/or non-cirrhotics) or 24 weeks ( non-GT1b cirrhotics) , were retrospectively collected. Population characteristics: boceprevir/telaprevir-failure: 82/45 , GT1b: 117 , cirrhotic: 111 ( 87.4 %). SVR12/24 was observed in 103/105 patients ( 98.1 %) of those who reached either time point. Four SAEs reported: one death due to myocardial infarction , another due to recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after achieving SVR12 , two hospitalizations ( elevation of transaminases , pneumonia<disease> Grade ≥ 3 AEs or laboratory abnormalities were reported in < 10 % of patients; they were transient in all patients. No early discontinuation of drugs due to SAE has been reported. One year after previous failure of boceprevir or telaprevir based therapy , 12 weeks of 3DAA + RBV combination in HCV GT1b infected patients is similarly effective and safe as in those with no previous HCV therapy , even in the presence of cirrhosis. These findings might be of particular interest in settings where alternative therapies for such patients are not available or not affordable.
