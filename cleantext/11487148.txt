  Teeth treated endodontically are more susceptible to vertical root fracture ( VRF). Some studies have suggested that obturating the root canals with Gutta-percha or Resilon can reinforce endodontically treated teeth , but a few others have presented conflicting results. These inconsistent results can not guide clinicians in determining clinical approaches. The objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate and compare the vertical fracture resistance of endodontically treated root canals obturated with Gutta-percha/AH plus and the Resilon system. Comprehensive literature searches were performed in the PubMed , Cochrane Library , ScienceDirect , Web of Science and Embase databases. The titles and abstracts of all of the retrieved articles were independently assessed by two authors according to predefined selection criteria. Data in the included articles were independently extracted. Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software. The pooled standardized mean differences ( SMDs) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were calculated for the outcome indicators. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The Cochran Q test ( I Fourteen randomized controlled in vitro trials were included in the meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that the vertical root fracture resistance of unprepared and unfilled roots was significantly higher than that of roots obturated with Gutta-percha/AH plus ( SMD =- 0.69 , 95 % CI =- 1.34 to- 0.04 , p = 0.04) or the Resilon system ( SMD =- 0.54 , 95 % CI =- 1.07 to- 0.00 , p = 0.05). The differences in fracture resistance between the roots filled with Gutta-percha/AH plus and the prepared unfilled root canals was not significant ( SMD = 0.59 , 95 % CI =- 0.02 to 1.21 , p = 0.06). Roots obturated with Resilon had higher fracture resistance than instrumented unfilled roots ( SMD = 0.83 , 95 % CI = 0.44 to 1.22 , p < 0.0001) or roots filled with Gutta-percha/AH plus ( SMD = 0.62 , 95 % CI = 0.01 to 1.23 , p = 0.05). The present study suggests that filling with Gutta-percha/AH plus dose not reinforce endodontically treated roots , whereas obturating with the Resilon system can increase vertical root fracture resistance of prepared roots. As this meta-analysis was based on in vitro studies , it should be careful to extrapolate its conclusion to the clinical context.
