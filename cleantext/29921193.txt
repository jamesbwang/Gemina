  Neurodegenerative disorder are persistently increasing and relentlessly affecting the individuals , families and society as whole. Regrettably these disorders are resistant to the available drugs , the outcomes are only palliative while the side effects of the therapy harm the patient compliance as well as treatment. Drugs from venomous source have been considered as an effective alternative for such types of disorders , particularly neurodegenerative diseases. Due to emerging advancement in the field of proteomics , genomics and molecular biology , characterization and screening of these novel compounds become more assessable. In this reverence , the present study reviews the current consideration of the mode of action and the future prediction concerning the use of novel compounds isolated from arthropods and other venomous animals in the treatment of major neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease , Alzheimer disease , Multiple Sclerosis , Epilepsy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
