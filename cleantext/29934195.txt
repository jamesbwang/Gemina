  Parkinsonism is one of the most prevalent neurological<disease> syndromes<disease> in the elderly. There are only a few epidemiological studies focusing on parkinsonism in oldest-old individuals , particularly in Latin America. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of parkinsonism in subjects aged 75 + years living in the community. The Pietà study is a population-based investigation on brain aging conducted in Caeté , southeast Brazil. A sample composed of 610 community-dwelling individuals aged 75 + years ( 48.7 % of the total population within this age range) underwent clinical , neurological , cognitive and functional assessments. The sample comprised mostly women ( 61.5 %) , with mean age of 83.3 years and mean schooling of 2.5 years. Parkinsonism was identified in 65 subjects ( crude prevalence = 10.7 %). Parkinson 's disease , Parkinsonism + dementia syndrome<disease> , drug-induced parkinsonism , vascular parkinsonism and Lewy-body dementia were identified in , respectively , 19 ( 29.2 %) , 19 ( 29.2 %) , 8 ( 12.3 %) , 4 ( 6.1 %) and 1 ( 1.5 %) subjects. In 14 individuals ( 21.5 %) , the etiology of parkinsonism could not be determined. The most important vascular risk factor was hypertension ( 64.6 %). Cognitive evaluation disclosed dementia in 37 ( 56.9 %) subjects. Mean Pfeffer 's functional activities questionnaire score was 12.2 points and 22 ( 33.8 %) subjects were impaired in basic activities of daily living. Parkinsonism was common in this oldest-old population , being associated with dementia and vascular risk factors , particularly hypertension. Different confounders , such as concomitant dementia and exposure to anti-dopaminergic drugs , were present in this population , challenging the definition of causes of parkinsonism.
