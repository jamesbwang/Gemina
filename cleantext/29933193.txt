  Our study was to explore the potential role of miRNA-200b in modulating tumorigenesis in the model of ulcerative colitis-related colorectal cancer ( UCRCC) and , further , to decipher the underlying mechanisms associated with this effect. In this study , we examined a greater number of polyps or adenomas , a higher grade of epithelial dysplasia accompanied with a decrease in survival ratio in azoxymethane ( AOM)/ dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS) model mice compared to mice treated with over-expressed miRNA-200b. Surprisingly , enforced miRNA-200b expression significantly suppressed AOM/DSS-induced up-regulation of oncologic markers including β-catenin and CD133. Independent of this , treatment with miRNA-200b obviously attenuated inflammatory responses , as indicated by down-regulating tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) , transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) and blockade of AKT2-mediated NF-κB/IL -6/ STAT3 signaling pathway. Furthermore , a simultaneous shift in epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) markers such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin were observed to be increased and decreased , respectively. Coupled with the associated influence of over-expressed miRNA-200b were change in colorectal cell morphology shown by Transmission electron microscope ( TEM) and a decrease in expression of rho-kinase2 ( ROCK2) together with AKT2 phosphorylation ( p-AKT2). Moreover , mice which were transfected with negative control of miRNA-200b possessed results that were in line with that obtained from AOM/DSS model mice. Additionally , we demonstrated that the 3 ` untranslated region ( UTR) of AKT2 was a direct target of miRNA-200b through bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase assay. Collectively , these findings suggest that miRNA-200b 's contribution to tumor-suppressing program was correlated with EMT and inflammatory responses in a AKT2-dependent manner.
