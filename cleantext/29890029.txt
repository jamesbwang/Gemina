  Community violence exposure is a common stressor , known to compromise youth cognitive and emotional development. In a diverse , urban sample of 22 adolescents , participants reported on community violence exposure ( witnessing a beating or illegal drug use , hearing gun shots , or other forms of community violence) in early adolescence ( average age 12.99) , and underwent a neuroimaging scan 3-5 years later ( average age 16.92). Community violence exposure in early adolescence predicted smaller manually traced left and right hippocampal and amygdala volumes in a model controlling for age , gender , and concurrent community violence exposure , measured in late adolescence. Community violence continued to predict hippocampus ( but not amygdala) volumes after we also controlled for family aggression exposure in early adolescence. Community violence exposure was also associated with stronger resting state connectivity between the right hippocampus ( using the manually traced structure as a seed region) and bilateral frontotemporal regions including the superior temporal gyrus and insula. These resting state connectivity results held after controlling for concurrent community violence exposure , SES , and family aggression. Although this is the first study focusing on community violence in conjunction with brain structure and function , these results dovetail with other research linking childhood adversity with smaller subcortical volumes in adolescence and adulthood , and with altered frontolimbic resting state connectivity. Our findings suggest that even community-level exposure to neighborhood violence can have detectable neural correlates in adolescents.
