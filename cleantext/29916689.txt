  The detection and adsorption of volatile low-molecular-weight aliphatic aldehydes is of significance , owing to their physical volatility , chemical toxicity , and widespread applications in chemical industrial processes. Here , nonporous adaptive pillar ( 4) arene ( 1) quinone ( EtP4Q1) crystals with vapochromic behavior are used for the volatile aliphatic aldehyde uptake and sensing. When desolvated EtP4Q1 crystals ( EtP4Q1α) are exposed to aliphatic aldehydes with different carbon chain lengths , they quantitatively adsorb vapors of these aldehydes , accompanied by different color<symptom> changes<symptom>. Crystal structure analyses show that the structure of EtP4Q1 transforms from EtP4Q1α into the corresponding new structures after the adsorption of these aldehydes , which leads to different color<symptom> changes<symptom>. The selectivity of EtP4Q1α crystals , which function as both sensors and adsorbents upon exposure to mixed aldehyde vapors , is also explored. Finally , it is demonstrated that EtP4Q1α crystals can be recycled many times without loss of performance.
