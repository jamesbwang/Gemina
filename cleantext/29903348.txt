  Various invasive medical procedures might induce bacteremia and , hence , act as triggers for infective endocarditis<disease> However , empirical data in humans on the potential dangers of invasive medical procedures in this regard are very sparse. Due to lack of sufficient data , it is currently debated whether the risk for endocarditis<disease> with medical procedures is substantial or rather negligible. The purpose of this nationwide case-crossover study was to quantify the excess risk for infective endocarditis<disease> in association with invasive medical and surgical procedures. The authors identified all adult patients treated for endocarditis<disease> in hospitals in Sweden between January 1 , 1998 , and December 31 , 2011. The authors applied a case-crossover design and compared the occurrence of invasive medical procedures 12 weeks before endocarditis<disease> with a corresponding 12-week time period exactly 1 year earlier. The authors considered all invasive nondental medical procedures except for those that are likely to be undertaken due to endocarditis<disease> or sepsis<disease> or due to infections that could possibly lead to endocarditis<disease> The authors identified 7,013 cases of infective endocarditis<disease> during the study period. Among others , several cardiovascular procedures , especially coronary artery bypass grafting; procedures of the skin and management of wounds<disease> transfusion; dialysis; bone<disease> marrow puncture; and some endoscopies , particularly bronchoscopy , were strongly associated with an increased risk for infective endocarditis<disease> This study suggests that several invasive nondental medical procedures are associated with a markedly increased risk for infective
