  This article presents a useful and promising approach for fabricating extremely stable silicone oil nanoemulsions , whose liquid-liquid interface is structured with a thin film of amphiphilic triblock copolymers. For this , two types of amphiphilic triblock polymer , poly ( 2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine)- block-poly ( ε-caprolactone)- block-poly ( 2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine) ( PMPC-PCL-PMPC) and poly ( 2-aminoethyl methacrylate)- block-poly ( ε-caprolactone)- block-poly ( 2-aminoethyl methacrylate) ( PAMA-PCL-PAMA) , were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization. Employing the phase separation technique was critical for the formation of thin polymer interfaces , of less than 10 nm , thus eventually producing structurally stable silicone oil nanoemulsions. The co-assembly of PAMA-PCL-PAMA with PMPC-PCL-PMPC enabled the patching of positive charges on the surface of the emulsion drops. We show that these charged silicone oil nanoemulsions could be used to form a multilayer emulsion thin film by layer-by-layer deposition. Finally , we experimentally demonstrate that the silicone oil nanoemulsions fabricated in this way were highly stable and had the ability to electrostatically interact with hair , which enabled complete coating of the hair surface with a layer of silicone oil.
