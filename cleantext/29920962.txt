  New peptides derived from the natural antimicrobial temporin B were obtained. The design , antimicrobial activity , and characterization of the secondary structure of peptides in the presence of bacterial cells is described herein. TB_KKG6K ( KKLLPIVKNLLKSLL) has been identified as the most active analogue against Gram-positive and- negative bacteria , compared with natural temporin B ( LLPIVGNLLKSLL) and TB_KKG6A ( KKLLPIVANLLKSLL). Acylation with hydrophobic moieties generally led to reduced activity; however , acylation at the 6-position of TB_KKG6K led to retained sub-micromolar activity against
