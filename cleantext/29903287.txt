  To develop an indirect competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay ( CLEIA) for the detection of bisphenol A in milk samples. The CLEIA conditions including antigen coated concentration , concentration of methanol , concentration of enzyme labeled anti-antibody , p H and ionic strength were optimized to build competitive inhibition curve , determine the linear range and detection limit , and study the recovery of spiked milk samples. In the standard curve of the optimized CLEIA , the half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC _ ( 50)) was 3. 95 ng/m L and the limit of detection ( LOD) was 0. 66 ng/m L. The CLEIA showed good recoveries with spiked milk ranging from 95. 0 % -112. 9 % with the relative standard deviation of0. 93 % -3. 96 %. The proposed method has a high sensitivity and good specificity and is suitable for the determination of bisphenol A in milk samples.
