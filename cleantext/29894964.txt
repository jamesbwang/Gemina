  Metallurgical exploitation originates metal-rich by-products termed slags , which are often disposed in the environment being a source of heavy metal pollution. Despite the environmental risk that this may pose for living organisms , little is known about the impact of slags on biotic components of the ecosystem like plants and rhizosphere microbial communities. In this study , metal-rich ( Cu , Pb , Zn) granulated slags ( GS) derived from Cu production process , were used for a leaching test in the presence of the soil pore solution , showing that soil solution enhanced the release of Cu from GS. A pot experiment was conducted using as growing substrate for sunflower ( Helianthus annuus) a 50 % w/w mix of an agricultural soil and GS. Bioavailability of metals in soil was , in increasing order: Pb < Zn < Cu. Sunflower was able to grow in the presence of GS and accumulated metals preferentially in above-ground tissues. Microbial diversity was assessed in rhizosphere and bulk soil using community level physiological profiling ( CLPP) and 16S rRNA gene based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE) analyses , which demonstrated a shift in the diversity of microbial communities induced by GS. Overall , these results suggest that metallurgical wastes should not be considered inert when dumped in the soil. Implications from this study are expected to contribute to the development of sustainable practices for the management of pyrometallurgical slags , possibly involving a phytomanagement approach.
