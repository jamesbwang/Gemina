  Gastric cancer ( stomach cancer) is the fifth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Identifying gastric cancer patients at an early and curable stage of the disease is essential if mortality rates for this disease are to decrease. A non-invasive blood-based test that is an indicator of gastric cancer risk would likely be of benefit in identifying gastric cancer patients at an early stage , and such a test may enhance clinical decision making. This study identified a four-gene expression signature in peripheral blood samples associated with gastric cancer. A total of 216 blood samples were collected , including those from 36 gastric cancer patients , 55 healthy controls and 125 patients with other carcinomas , and gene expression profiles were examined using an Affymetrix Gene Profiling microarray. Blood gene expression profiles were compared between patients with stomach cancer , healthy controls and patients affected with other malignancies. A four-gene panel was identified comprising purine-rich element binding protein B , structural maintenance of chromosomes 1A , DENN/MADD domain containing 1B and programmed cell death 4. The four-gene panel discriminated gastric cancer with an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0.99 , an accuracy of 95 % , sensitivity of 92 % and specificity of 96 %. The non-invasive nature of the blood test , together with the relatively high accuracy of the four-gene panel may assist physicians in gastric cancer screening decision making.
