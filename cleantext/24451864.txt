  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of 2 piezosurgical split techniques performed in conjunction with the sinus lift.The present retrospective study included 20 patients with edentulism of the posterior maxilla who had undergone the sinus lift and alveolar ridge split treatment separately or the sinus lift combined with the monoblock alveolar ridge split. Differences between these 2 techniques were analyzed.All the surrounding areas successfully produced an adequate bone volume for the insertion of implants. A clinical evaluation showed a mean vertical augmentation of 3.6 ± 0.4 mm in Group A and 3.2 ± 0.7 mm in Group B. With regards to the lateral augmentation , the clinical evaluation gives a mean gain of 5.2 ± 0.3 mm in Group A and 4.9 ± 0.5 mm in Group B. The mean vertical and horizontal bone augmentation recorded for both types of surgical procedures were comparable.The proposed surgical procedures enabled the tridimensional volume of the alveolar ridge to be recreated. This resulted in the creation of a natural contour of hard and soft tissues which enabled a functional and aesthetic rehabilitation of the edentulous posterior maxilla to be obtained.
