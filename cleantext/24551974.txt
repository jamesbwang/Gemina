  Different formulations of Bacillus<pathogen> thuringiensis<pathogen> var. israelensis<pathogen> ( Bti) have been tested against different mosquito vectors and other insects for their residual activity. In the present study , the efficacy and residual activity of a new formulation of Bti ( Bactivec Suspension Concentrate) were evaluated against immature stages of Anopheles<pathogen> stephensi Liston ( Diptera: Culicidae) , Aedes<pathogen> aegypti Linnaeus ( Diptera: Culicidae) and Culex<pathogen> quinquefasciatus Say ( Diptera: Culicidae) , in natural habitats in Phase II and Phase III in Bengaluru , India. Preferential breeding habitats of the mosquito species were selected and four dosages ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 and 2 ml/50 l) were tested in Phase II trial. Two most effective dosages , 0.5 and 1 ml/50 l were selected for Phase III trial. The evaluation was carried out essentially following the guidelines of the World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme. Pre-treatment and post-treatment densities were recorded at regular intervals , and > 80 per cent reduction in pupae was taken as the duration of effectiveness. Bactivec SC treated at the dosage of 1 ml/50 l could produce 10-17 days efficacy ( > 80 % reduction in pupae) in clean water habitats tested , whereas 0.5 ml/50 l dosage showed residual activity from 7 to 14 days against Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi in Phase III studies. In polluted water habitats , 4-7 days efficacy could be recorded against Cx. quinquefasciatus in Phase III. The Bactivec SC formulation was operationally feasible and easy to handle. For the control of Anopheles<pathogen> and Aedes<pathogen> mosquitoes in freshwater habitats , 1 ml/50 l dosage was found effective , whereas in polluted water habitats against Cx. quinquefasciatus 5 ml/m
