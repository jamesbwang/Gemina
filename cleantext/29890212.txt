  Although central venous pressure ( CVP) is a surrogate measure of preload in patients with acute decompensated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( ADHF) , it is a multifactorial index influenced not only by fluid volume status , but also by cardiac pump function and other factors. We aimed to elucidate the individual pathophysiologic factors of CVP elevation in ADHF patients by assessing the relationship between CVP and extracellular fluid volume status ( EVS). We quantified EVS in 100 ADHF patients using bioelectrical impedance analysis. CVP was also measured at the same time point. Subjects were categorized into tertiles according to their CVP/EVS ratios , and patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared among these tertiles. The upper tertile group had a higher incidence of impaired right ventricular pump function , whereas the lower tertile group had higher incidences of severe<symptom> inflammation<symptom> , hypoalbuminemia , and renal dysfunction. Patients in both the upper and lower tertiles had a significantly higher cardiac event rate than those in the middle tertile. The combined assessment of CVP and EVS provides insight into both the total volume status and distribution of body fluid in ADHF patients , and may have applications in guiding decongestive therapy and improving prognostic predictions.
