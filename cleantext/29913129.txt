  Lymphoblastic lymphomas ( LBLs) are neoplasms of precursor B and T cells; they are considered in the same spectrum as precursor B and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL). The World Health Organization classification classifies both LBL and ALL as one disease entity. While chromosome abnormalities are well defined with all of their therapeutic and prognostic implications in ALL , these are not well studied in LBL. Here , we describe a case of Philadelphia chromosome-positive LBL and review the available literature regarding this entity.
