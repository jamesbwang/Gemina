  The 8th edition of AJCC TNM staging manual for gastric cancer ( GC) has been validated by several studies. A modified staging system based on it and total harvested number of lymph nodes ( LNs; cutoff: 30) is suggested to improve predictive capacities for advanced GC. This study is designed to validate the modified method using a single-center database in Southern China. Clinical data from 684 GC patients with stage II and III according to the 7th edition between 2001 and 2012 were reviewed. A modified staging system was applied to restage the cohort. The three staging systems were compared in terms of prognostic performance on long-term survival. The median follow-up period of this cohort was 52 ( range , 6-180) months , with a median 5-year overall survival rate of 52.4 %. Stage migration was observed in 159 ( 23.2 %) patients according to the 8th edition of TNM staging , and another migration was observed in 108 ( 15.8 %) patients according to the modified TNM staging system. Compared with the modified staging system , both 7th and 8th edition of AJCC TNM staging systems did not prove survival concordance on stage IIIA ( 7th edition) and stage IIIC ( 8th edition) when < 30 LNs were examined. The survival performance between two AJCC staging systems had no significant improvement ( c-index , 0.607 vs. 0.609) , with the best prognostic stratification obtained using the modified staging method ( c-index , 0.631). The modified staging system on basis of the 8th AJCC classification and the number of harvested LNs could provide an optimal predictive capacities for advanced gastric cancer.
