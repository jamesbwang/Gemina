  Patient characteristics associated with hypoglycaemia frequency during insulin glargine 100 U/mL ( Gla-100) titration and clinical outcomes at Week 24 were examined using participant-level data from 16 treat-to-target trials involving individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetes drugs and were initiating Gla-100 ( n = 3549). Hypoglycaemia ( plasma glucose < 3.9 mmol/L or severe) during the first 8 weeks of titration was stratified by number of events ( 0 , 1-3 and ≥ 4) , resulting in 72.5 % , 20.6 % and 6.9 % of participants in each group , respectively. Changes in glycaemia , body<symptom> weight and insulin dose from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 were analysed. Hypoglycaemia was more common in participants with lower BMI and fasting C-peptide , and in those undergoing sulfonylurea treatment. Glycaemic outcomes at Week 24 were similar in each hypoglycaemia group , despite the fact that the Week 24 mean daily dose and dose increase for Gla-100 were highest in participants without hypoglycaemia and were lowest in those experiencing ≥ 4 events. The risk of hypoglycaemia during Gla-100 titration depends mainly on patient characteristics and on sulfonylurea use and may delay dose titration , which apparently has little effect on short-term glycaemic control in a clinical trial setting.
