  The heterogeneity of post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) symptoms indicates that multiple neurobiological mechanisms underlie the pathophysiology of the condition. However , no generally accepted PTSD biomarkers in clinical practice currently exist. The sequential responses to recurrent and chronic stress by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system ( ANS) system are considered to play a significant role in the onset and progression of PTSD. Decreased activity of the HPA axis and parasympathetic nervous system , along with increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system , have been observed in PTSD , which may lead to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Such heightened activity of the immune system may cause alterations in the structure and function of brain regions-for example , the amygdala , hippocampus , medial prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex , and insula-through changes in levels of serotonin and kynurenine pathway metabolites , and direct neurotoxic effects of cytokines. Although chronic inflammation-induced alterations in brain regions critical in controlling emotional behavior and fear regulation may represent a strong candidate biomarker of PTSD , future studies are necessary to further elucidate inflammation-associated neural biomarkers of PTSD. Continued research on therapeutic methods that involve the normalization of the HPA axis , ANS , and immune system is expected to contribute to the development of novel ways to treat PTSD.
