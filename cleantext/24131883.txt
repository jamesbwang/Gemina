  The problem of analyzing temporally ordered sequences of observations generated by molecular , physiological or psychological processes to make predictions about the outcome of these processes arises in many domains of clinical informatics. In this paper , we focus on predicting the outcome of patient-provider communication sequences in the context of the clinical dialog. Specifically , we consider prediction of the motivational interview success ( i.e. eliciting a particular type of patient behavioral response) based on an observed sequence of coded patient-provider communication exchanges as a sequence classification problem. We propose two solutions to this problem , one that is based on Recurrent Neural Networks ( RNNs) and another that is based on Markov Chain ( MC) and Hidden Markov Model ( HMM) , and compare the accuracy of these solutions using communication sequences annotated with behavior codes from the real-life motivational interviews. Our experiments indicate that the deep learning-based approach is significantly more accurate than the approach based on probabilistic models in predicting the success of motivational interviews ( 0.8677 versus 0.7038 and 0.6067 F1-score by RNN , MC and HMM , respectively , when using undersampling to correct for class imbalance , and 0.8381 versus 0.7775 and 0.7520 F1-score by RNN , MC and HMM , respectively , when using over-sampling). These results indicate that the proposed method can be used for real-time monitoring of progression of clinical interviews and more efficient identification of effective provider communication strategies , which in turn can significantly decrease the effort required to develop behavioral interventions and increase their effectiveness.
