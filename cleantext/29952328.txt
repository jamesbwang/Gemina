  We evaluate the behavior of a device designed to automatically divert and store the first flush of harvested rainwater in cisterns. The first phase ( PI) was conducted with artificial precipitation in an experimental installation seeking to identify how many millimeters of rainwater should be diverted to preserve the rainwater quality. In the second phase ( PII) , we designed a PVC-pipe device to store the first millimeter of rainwater , and tested it in field ( a rural area in Brazil) during two real rainfall events. In the third phase ( PIII) , the device and a hand pump were assayed for two years using eight cisterns in a rural area where people drink the rainwater. PI results indicated that the most significant pollution of the rainwater is flushed with the first millimeter of rain , and diversion promoted the removal of 98 % and 100 % of the total coliforms and Escherichia<pathogen> coli , respectively. The bacteriological behavior was maintained in the subsequent phases. The device was able to preserve the quality of the rainwater most of the time , satisfying drinking requirements for the parameters of turbidity and color. The satisfactory performance of the device was confirmed in the field , behaving as a sanitary barrier for rainwater quality protection.
