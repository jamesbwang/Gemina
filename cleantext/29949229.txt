  Adventitious roots occur naturally in many species and can also be induced from explants of some tree species including Populus , providing an important means of clonal propagation. Auxin has been identified as playing a crucial role in adventitious root formation , but the associated molecular regulatory mechanisms need to be elucidated. In this study , we examined the role of PagFBL1 , the hybrid poplar ( Populus alba Ã— P. glandulosa clone 84K) homolog of Arabidopsis auxin receptor TIR1 , in adventitious root formation in poplar. Similar to the distribution pattern of auxin during initiation of adventitious roots , PagFBL1 expression was concentrated in the cambium and secondary phloem in stems during adventitious root induction and initiation phases , but decreased in emerging adventitious root primordia. Overexpressing PagFBL1 stimulated adventitious root formation and increased root biomass , while knock-down of PagFBL1 transcript levels delayed adventitious root formation and decreased root biomass. Transcriptome analyses of PagFBL1 overexpressing lines indicated that an extensive remodelling of gene expression was stimulated by auxin signalling pathway during early adventitious root formation. In addition , PagIAA28 was identified as downstream targets of PagFBL1. We propose that the PagFBL1-PagIAA28 module promotes adventitious rooting and could be targeted to improve Populus propagation by cuttings.
