  Pilonidal sinus disease ( PSD) is associated with a complex<disease> disease<disease> process in children , and its management remains controversial. There are a few published studies on PSD in the paediatric literature; therefore , we present our experience of conservatively treating PSD in children. This study involved a retrospective review with telephone follow up. All children diagnosed with PSD in 2012 to 2017 were identified at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Paediatric Surgery. All patients initially underwent conservative treatment ( meticulous hair removal , improved perianal hygiene , warm sitz baths , and drainage for abscess<disease> Data collection included demographics , type of management , recurrence , presence of infection , and total healing time. In the study period , 29 children were identified. Their mean age was 14.94 ± 1.09 ( range: 12-16) years , and 51.7 % were girls. The mean length of follow up was 8.34 ± 6.36 ( range: 1-25) months. Complete healing occurred in 79.3 % of patients. Recurrence was evident in 12 % of patients. Four patients underwent surgery. PSD is being seen in children more frequently in recent years. Conservative treatment may be the recommended initial approach for PSD in children.
