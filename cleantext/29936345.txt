  In this paper , the 3 , 4 , 9 , 10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid-graphene ( PTCA-G) composite was synthesized and the corrosion protection property of epoxy coating-coated Q235 steel containing PTCA-G composite was investigated. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) proved that 3 , 4 , 9 , 10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid ( PTCA) and graphene ( G) were combined via π-π interactions and hydrophobic forces between PTCA and G. The results of electrochemical tests indicated that with additives of sole PTCA , sole G and PTCA-G composite , the corrosion resistance of epoxy coating was increased compared with pure epoxy coating. And the most significant improved corrosion resistance of PTCA-G/epoxy coating might be attributed to the good dispersion and barrier performance of PTCA-G composite in the epoxy coating. Besides , compared with the corrosion protection property of PTCA-G/epoxy coating with other volume ratios , the corrosion resistance of epoxy coating containing PTCA-G composite with 10:4 vol ratio of PTCA and G was the best. It might be attributed to the excellent barrier and dispersion properties of PTCA-G composite with 10:4 vol ratio of PTCA and G.
