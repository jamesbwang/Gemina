  It is now recognized that repetitive head impacts ( RHI) in sport have the potential for long-term neurological impairments. In order to identify targets for intervention and/or pharmacological treatment , it is necessary to characterize the neurobiological mechanisms associated with RHI. This review aims to summarize animal and human studies that specifically address Blood Brain Barrier ( BBB) dysfunction , abnormal neuro-metabolic and neuro-inflammatory processes as well as Tau aggregation associated with RHI in collision sports. Additionally , we examine the influence of physical activity and genetics on outcomes of RHI , discuss methodological considerations , and provide suggestions for future directions of this burgeoning area of research.
