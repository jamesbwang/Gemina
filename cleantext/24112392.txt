  The widespread use of next generation sequencing ( NGS) has led to a refined understanding of the genomics of colorectal cancer ( CRC). However , progress in the use of molecular biomarkers in standard practice has been slow , and there is no approved targeted therapy for CRC based on a positive predictive marker yet. In this review , we will first summarize biomarkers with clinical utility in standard practice or targeted therapy trials and then consider how to rationally design clinical trials to more effectively target CRC. Specifically , we will discuss current clinical applications of genomic information consisting of the use of the MAPK ( mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway genes
