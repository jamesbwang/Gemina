  This review aims to explore the healthcare needs and access to healthcare services among Syrian refugees in Jordan. Furthermore , it identifies possible ways of responding to such needs within the framework of the structural challenges faced in this particular context. Through qualitative techniques , this study systematically reviewed nine articles identified in academic and international organizations ' databases. Six articles are from scholarly sources , while three are published reports or commentary articles; thus , there are variations in methodological rigour. An analysis of the articles was performed based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme check tool to systematically assess the trustworthiness , relevance and results of the included papers. The overall access to healthcare is relatively good for most registered Syrian refugees. However , some groups lack access due to financial and structural barriers , such as not possessing the appropriate civil documentation and/or not having the means to pay out-of-pocket expenses to access adequate services. A key challenge relates to access of inpatient care. Accessing care for non-communicable/chronic diseases requires not only legal documentation but also long-term access and continuity of care in an already overburdened health care system. The healthcare needs of the refugee , as well as the host population in Jordan , can not be adequately met without the international society acknowledging a collective responsibility , including a financial commitment. One effort that could solve a major structural problem for those not able to access healthcare is increased flexibility in regards to documentation.
