  We examined links between markers of social inequality and fracture risk in the Danish population , demonstrating that high income and being married are associated with a significantly lower risk. We explored whether the risk of hip , humerus , and wrist fracture was associated with markers of inequality using data from Danish health registries. All patients 50 years or older with a primary hip ( ICD10 S720 , S721 , S722 , and S729) humerus ( ICD10 S422 , S423 , S424 , S425 , S426 , and S427) , or wrist ( ICD10: S52) fracture were identified from 1/1/1995 to 31/12/2011. Fracture patients were matched 1:1 by age , sex , and year of fracture , to a non-fracture control. Markers of inequality were as follows: income ( fifths); marital status ( married , divorced , widowed , or unmarried); area of residence ( remote , rural , intermediate , or urban). Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate associations between these exposures , and risk of fracture , adjusting for covariates ( smoking , alcohol , and Charlson co-morbidity). Interactions were fitted between exposure and covariates where appropriate. A total of 189,838 fracture patients ( 37,500 hip , 45,602 humerus , and 106,736 wrist) and 189,838 controls were included. Mean age was 73.9 years ( hip) , 67.5 years ( humerus) , and 65.3 years ( wrist). High income ( 5th quintile) was significantly associated with a lower odds ratio of all three fractures , compared to average income ( 3rd quintile). Married subjects had a significantly decreased odds ratio across all three fractures. However , no overall secular difference was observed regarding the influence of the markers of inequality. In conclusion , we have demonstrated important , stable associations between social inequality , assessed using income , marital status , and area of residence , and fracture at the population level. These findings can inform approaches to healthcare , and suggest that much thought should be given to novel interventions aimed especially at those living alone , and ideally societal measures to reduce social inequality.
