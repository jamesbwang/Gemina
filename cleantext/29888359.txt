  The practical application of tin dioxide ( SnO2) in lithium-ion batteries has been greatly hindered by its large volumetric expansion and low conductivity. Thus , a rational design of the size , geometry and the pore structure of SnO2-based nanomaterials is still a dire demand. To this end , herein we report an effective approach for engineering hollow-structured SnO2 nanospheres with adequate surface oxygen vacancies simultaneously wrapped by a nitrogen-doped graphene network ( SnO2-x/N-rGO) through an electrostatic adsorption-induced self-assembly together with a thermal reduction process. The close electrostatic attraction achieved a tight and uniform combination of positively charged SnO2 nanospheres with negatively charged graphene oxide ( GO) , which can alleviate the aggregation and volume expansion of the entrapped SnO2 nanospheres. Subsequent thermal treatment not only ensures a significant reduction of the GO sheets accompanying nitrogen-doping , but also induces the generation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the SnO2 hollow nanospheres , together building up a long-range and bicontinuous transfer channel for rapid electron and ion transport. Because of these structural merits , the as-built SnO2-x/N-rGO composite used as the anode material exhibits excellent robust cycling stability ( âˆ¼ 912 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 and 652 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 1 A g-1) and superior rate capability ( 309 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1). This facile fabrication strategy may pave the way for the construction of high performance SnO2-based anode materials for potential application in advanced lithium-ion batteries.
