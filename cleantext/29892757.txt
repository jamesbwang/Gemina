  Biomimetic sensor technology is always superior to existing human technologies. The scorpion , especially the forest<disease> scorpion , has a unique ability to detect subtle vibrations , which is attributed to the microcrack-shaped slit sensillum on its legs. Here , the biological sensing mechanism of the typical scorpion ( Heterometrus petersii) was intensively studied in order to newly design and significantly improve the flexible strain sensors. Benefiting from the easy-crack property of polystyrene ( PS) and using the solvent-induced swelling as well as double template transferring method , regular and controllable microcrack arrays were successfully fabricated on top of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS). Using this method , any physical damage to PDMS could be effectively avoided. More fortunately , this bio-inspired crack arrays fabricated in this work also had a radial-like pattern similar to the slit sensillum of the scorpion , which was another unexpected imitation. The gauge factor ( GF) of the sensor was conservatively evaluated at 5888.89 upon 2 % strain and the response time was 297 ms. Afterward , it was demonstrated that the bio-inspired regular microcrack arrays could also significantly enhance the performance of traditional strain sensors , especially in terms of the sensitivity and response time. The practical applications , such as the detection of human motions and surface folding , were also tested in this work , with the results showing significant potential applications in numerous fields. This work changes the traditional waste cracks on some damaged products into valuable things for ultrasensitive mechanical sensors. Moreover , with this manufacturing technique , we could easily realize the simple , low cost and large-scale fabrication of advanced bioinpired sensors.
