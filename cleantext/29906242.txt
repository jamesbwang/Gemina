  We previously developed a tissue-engineered vascular graft ( TEVG) made by seeding autologous cells onto a biodegradable tubular scaffold , in an attempt to create a living vascular graft with growth potential for use in children undergoing congenital heart surgery. Results of our clinical trial showed that the TEVG possesses growth capacity but that its widespread clinical use is not yet advisable due to the high incidence of TEVG stenosis. In animal models , TEVG stenosis is caused by increased monocytic cell recruitment and its classic ( `` M1 '') activation. Here , we report on the source and regulation of these monocytes. TEVGs were implanted in wild-type , CCR2 knockout ( Ccr2
