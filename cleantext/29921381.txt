  Lumbar intervertebral disc protrusion ( LIDP) is a frequently occurring disease and 10-20 % of patients require surgical treatment. Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy ( PTED) and mini-incision surgery are currently the most common surgeries for patients. To analyze the efficacy of PTED and mini-incision surgery in the treatment of lumbar intervertebral disc protrusion , this study selected 216 patients with LIDP who were admitted to the hospital between February 2014 and June 2015. The subjects were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group , 108 each. Patients in the observation groups were treated by PTED , while patients in the control group were treated by mini-incision surgery , and treatment efficacy of the two groups was observed. The results demonstrated that the duration of surgery and length of hospital stay of the observation group were significantly shorter than those of the control group , the intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> of the observation group was significantly less than that of the control group and the size of surgical incision of the observation group was much smaller than that of the control group ( P less than 0.05). As to clinical efficacy , in accordance with the Japanese Orthopaedic Association ( JOA) score and the Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS) score , results of the observation group were superior to those of the control group at 3 months after surgery ( P less than 0.05). In conclusion , treating patients with LIDP through PTED can significantly improve treatment efficacy , shorten surgical and healing time and relieve pain. This therapy is worth clinical promotion.
