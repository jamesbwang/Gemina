  The objective of the study was to: a) characterize the frequency , type , and outcome of anesthetic medication errors spanning an 8.5-year period , b) describe the targeted error reduction strategies and c) measure the effects , if any , of a focused , continuous , multifaceted Medication Safety Program. Retrospective analysis. All anesthetizing locations ( 57). All anesthesia patients at all Boston Children 's Hospital anesthetizing locations from January 2008 to June 2016 were included. Medication libraries , zero-tolerance philosophy , independent verification , trainee education , standardized dosing; retrospective study. Number and type of medication errors. 105 medication errors were identified among the 287,908 cases evaluated during the study period. Incorrect dose ( 55 %) and incorrect medication ( 28 %) were the most frequently observed errors. Beginning within 3 years of the implementation of the 2009 Medication Safety Program , the incidence declined to an average of 3.0 per 10,000 cases in the years from 2010 to 2016 ( 57 % reduction) and declined to an average of only 2.2 per 10,000 cases since 2012 ( 69 % reduction). Logistic regression indicated a 13 % reduction per year in the odds of a medication error over the time period ( odds ratio = 0.87 , 95 % CI: 0.79-0.95 , P = 0.004). Although medication errors persisted , there was a statistically significant reduction in errors during the study period. Formalized Medication Safety Programs should be adopted by other departments and institutions; these Programs could help prevent medication errors and decrease their overall incidence.
