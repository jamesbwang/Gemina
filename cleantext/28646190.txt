  The neural mechanism for selectively tuning in to a target speaker while tuning out the others in a multi-speaker situation ( i.e. , the cocktail-party effect) remains elusive. Here we addressed this issue by measuring brain activity simultaneously from a listener and from multiple speakers while they were involved in naturalistic conversations. Results consistently show selectively enhanced interpersonal neural synchronization ( INS) between the listener and the attended speaker at left temporal-parietal junction , compared with that between the listener and the unattended speaker across different multi-speaker situations. Moreover , INS increases significantly prior to the occurrence of verbal responses , and even when the listener 's brain activity precedes that of the speaker. The INS increase is independent of brain-to-speech synchronization in both the anatomical location and frequency range. These findings suggest that INS underlies the selective process in a multi-speaker situation through neural predictions at the content level but not the sensory level of speech.
