  Good communication is integral to social accountability , and training is included in medical curricula internationally. In KwaZulu-Natal , training is conducted in English , in spite of most public sector patients being mother tongue isiZulu speakers. Communication challenges with patients are common , but good communication and African language teaching are not emphasised in teaching. This study explored communication training and how it related to social accountability at a single institution in KwaZulu-Natal. This exploratory , qualitative case study design at the medical school explored participants ' perceptions about communication and social accountability and reviewed relevant educational documentation for evidence. Purposive sampling was used to select medical students , educators and stakeholders from the educational and service platforms. Focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews were conducted. The data were thematically analysed with reference to Boelen 's social obligation scale for medical schools. Good communication was valued , but often poorly role-modelled. Participants agreed that communication and isiZulu teaching were insufficiently supported to respond adequately to the needs of local communities. Social accountability was not well understood by students , while medical school educators and other stakeholders indicated that , despite aspirations , this goal had not yet been achieved. Learning isiZulu language and culture in an integrated manner in both preclinical and clinical phases would improve communication with patients , contribute to socially responsive health care , and better address health care needs. Incorporating a social accountability framework in curriculum review would highlight the importance of measuring health outcomes and community impacts , and so enhance the educational mission of the medical school.
