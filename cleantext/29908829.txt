  The association between pre-hypertension ( pre-HTN) and subclinical cardiac damage remains undefined. We performed a systematic meta-analysis of echocardiographic studies in order to provide a comprehensive information on structural and functional cardiac changes in untreated pre-HTN subjects. Studies were identified by crossing the following search terms: `` pre-hypertension '' , `` high normal blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> '' `` heart '' `` left ventricular hypertrophy '' , `` left ventricular function '' , `` diastolic function '' , `` left atrial size '' , `` aortic root size '' , `` echocardiography. '' A total 73,556 subjects ( 44,170 normotensive , 17,314 pre-HTN , and 12,072 HTN individuals) of both genders were included in 20 studies. Left ventricular ( LV) mass index and relative wall thickness ( RWT) were greater in pre-HTN than in normotensives ( standard means difference: 0.32 ± 0.07 and 0.30 ± 0.07 , respectively , p < 0.001 for both). The E/e ' ratio ( 0.26 ± 0.02 , p < 0.001) and left atrium ( LA) diameter were higher ( 0.55 ± 0.02 , p < 0.001) in pre-HTN than in normotensive subjects. HTN subjects showed a greater LV mass index ( 0.27 ± 0.03 , p < 0.001) , RWT ( 0.23 ± 0.02 , p < 0.001) , increased E/e ' ratio ( 0.38 ± 0.09 , p < 0.001) as well as LA diameter ( 0.31 ± 0.12 , p < 0.001) than pre-HTN subjects. Our meta-analysis suggests that alterations in cardiac structure and function in pre-HTN subjects are intermediate between normotensive and HTN individuals. These findings suggest that pre-HTN may not be a benign entity. If so , early preventive strategies may prevent preclinical cardiac damage.
