  We developed a non-regularized , variable kernel , sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction for phase data ( NR-VSHARP) method to accurately estimate local tissue fields without regularization for quantitative susceptibility mapping ( QSM). We then used a digital brain phantom to evaluate the accuracy of the NR-VSHARP method , and compared it with the VSHARP and iterative spherical mean value ( iSMV) methods through in vivo human brain experiments. Our proposed NR-VSHARP method , which uses variable spherical mean value ( SMV) kernels , minimizes L2 norms only within the volume of interest to reduce phase errors and save cortical information without regularization. In a numerical phantom study , relative local field and susceptibility map errors were determined using NR-VSHARP , VSHARP , and iSMV. Additionally , various background field elimination methods were used to image the human brain. In a numerical phantom study , the use of NR-VSHARP considerably reduced the relative local field and susceptibility map errors throughout a digital whole brain phantom , compared with VSHARP and iSMV. In the in vivo experiment , the NR-VSHARP-estimated local field could sufficiently achieve minimal boundary losses and phase error suppression throughout the brain. Moreover , the susceptibility map generated using NR-VSHARP minimized the occurrence of streaking artifacts caused by insufficient background field removal. Our proposed NR-VSHARP method yields minimal boundary losses and highly precise phase data. Our results suggest that this technique may facilitate high-quality QSM.
