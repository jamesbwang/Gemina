  Oscillation in energy levels is widely variable in dividing and differentiated cells. To synchronize cell proliferation and energy fluctuations , cell cycle-related proteins have been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial energy-generating pathways in yeasts and animals. Plants have chloroplasts and mitochondria , coordinating the cell energy flow. Recent findings suggest an integrated regulation of these organelles and the nuclear cell cycle. Furthermore , reports indicate a set of interactions between the cell cycle and energy metabolism , coordinating the turnover of proteins in plants. Here , we discuss how cell cycle-related proteins directly interact with energy metabolism-related proteins to modulate energy homeostasis and cell cycle progression. We provide interfaces between cell cycle and energy metabolism-related proteins that could be explored to maximize plant yield.
