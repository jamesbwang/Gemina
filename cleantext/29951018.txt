  Information and communication technology ( ICT) is now an integrated and central element of modern life , and its rapid emergence is changing the execution and organization of work and learning. Digital technology is also important for schools , and hence for teachers ' working days. However , among today 's teachers , not everyone has the knowledge required to teach using digital technology. Recent research indicates that self-efficacy is important for how teachers master their practice. This paper addresses teachers ' ICT self-efficacy for educational purposes , and examines the assumed antecedents of teachers ' self-efficacy. Data from 1,158 teachers at 116 Norwegian schools was analyzed. The results indicate that teachers ' self-efficacy for using ICT in their teaching practice is associated with their use of ICT in teaching and their general ICT self-efficacy. In addition , the results show that collegial collaboration among teachers has a positive association with the use of ICT in their teaching practice. One interpretation of these findings is that general ICT self-efficacy is necessary for developing ICT self-efficacy for educational purposes and being able to use ICT in education. However , further research is required to scrutinize the relationships between these concepts.
