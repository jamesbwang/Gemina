  An apparatus is described for the compression of samples to ∼ 2 GPa at temperatures from 80 to 300 K , rapid chilling to 80 K whilst under load and subsequent recovery into liquid nitro-gen after the load is released. In this way , a variety of quenchable high-pressure phases of many materials may be preserved for examination outside the high-pressure sample environment , with the principal benefit being the ability to obtain high-resolution powder diffraction data for phase identification and structure solution. The use of this apparatus , in combination with a newly developed cold-loadable low-temperature stage for X-ray powder diffraction ( the PheniX-FL) , is illustrated using ice VI ( a high-pressure polymorph of ordinary water ice that is thermodynamically stable only above ∼ 0.6 GPa) as an example. A second example using synthetic epsomite ( MgSO
