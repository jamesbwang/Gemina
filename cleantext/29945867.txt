  Neuroendocrine cells in the pineal gland release melatonin during the night and , in teleosts , are directly photoreceptive. During development of the pineal complex , a small number of cells migrate leftward away from the pineal anlage to form the parapineal cell cluster , a process that is crucial for asymmetrical development of the bilateral habenular nuclei. Here , we show that , throughout zebrafish embryonic development , the
