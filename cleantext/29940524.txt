  Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC) represents the 15-20 % of all breast cancers ( BC) and is characterized by a very aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom>. Recent data suggest that TNBC is not a single disease , but it is rather an umbrella for different ontology-profiles such as basal like 1 and 2 , mesenchymal , and the luminal androgen receptor ( LAR). The LAR subtype is characterized by the expression of the Androgen Receptor ( AR) and its downstream effects. Notwithstanding the role of the AR in several signaling pathways , its impact on a biological and clinical standpoint is still controversial. The LAR subtype has been associated with better prognosis , less chemotherapy responsiveness and lower pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant treatment. Clinical evidence suggests a role for anti-androgen therapies such as bicalutamide , enzalutamide and abiraterone , offering an interesting chemo-free alternative for chemo-unresponsive patients , and therefore potentially shifting current treatment strategies.
