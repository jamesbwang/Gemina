  Resistive-pulse nanopore sensing enables label-free single-molecule analysis of a wide range of analytes. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of nanopore sensing for protein and peptide characterization. Nanopores offer the potential to study a variety of protein-related phenomena that includes unfolding kinetics , differences in unfolding pathways , protein structure stability and free energy profiles of DNA-protein and RNA-protein binding. In addition to providing a tool for fundamental protein characterization , nanopores have also been used as highly selective protein detectors in various solution mixtures and conditions. This review highlights these and other developments in the area of nanopore-based protein and peptide detection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
