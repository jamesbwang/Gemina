  Yellowjackets in the genera Vespula and Dolichovespula are prevalent eusocial insects of great ecological and economic significance , but the chemical signals of their sexual communication systems have defied structural elucidation. Herein , we report the identification of sex attractant pheromone components of virgin bald-faced hornet queens ( Dolichovespula maculata). We analyzed body surface extracts of queens by coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection ( GC-EAD) , isolated the compounds that elicited responses from male antennae by high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) , and identified these components by GC mass spectrometry ( MS) , HPLC-MS , and NMR spectroscopy. In laboratory olfactometer experiments , synthetic ( 2Z ,7 E) -3,7-dimethyldeca-2,7-diendioic acid ( termed here maculatic acid A) and ( 2Z ,7 E) -10-methoxy-3,7-dimethyldeca-10-oxo-deca-2,7-dienoic acid ( termed here maculatic acid C) in binary combination significantly attracted bald-faced hornet males. These are the first sex attractant pheromone components identified in yellowjackets.
