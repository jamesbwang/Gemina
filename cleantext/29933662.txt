  Naoxintong capsule ( NXTC) is an oral Chinese preparation produced by modern technology , derived from the classic preparation of Buyang Huanwu decoction which was recorded by WANG Qing-ren ( Qing dynasty) in Yilingaicuo Juanxia Tanweilun. NXTC is composed of 16 herbs including insect herbs and some blood circulation herbs , with the effects of supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation , dispersing blood stasis and dredging collaterals. In clinical application , it is mainly used for stroke , cerebral infarction , vascular dementia , ischemic cerebrovascular disease , transient ischemic attack , coronary heart disease , angina pectoris , ischemic cardiomyopathy , diabetic cardiomyopathy , myocardial infarction , chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , chronic complications of diabetes , essential hypertension , hyperlipidemia and other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases , and has achieved good therapeutic effect on above diseases or their concurrent diseases. Its clinical efficacy is mainly achieved through the improvement in related links of brain protection , neuroprotection , cardioprotection , hemorheology , et al.. Nearly 200 chemical constituents identified in NXTC are important pharmacological basis for its functions. At present , however , most of its pharmacological basic researches are focused on plant herbs , and the three kinds of insect herbs remain to be further studied. The researches on clinical effectiveness are more comprehensive; the safety study of long-term application in real world is ongoing by our team , and its results are yet to be published after finishing the study. Through the systematic and comprehensive combing and elaboration of the research progresses on the chemical compositions , pharmacological action and clinical application of NXTC , it can provide a reference for the in-depth study of this preparation , with a great significance for the quality control , secondary development and internationalization promotion of NXTC.
