  Sediment samples , including 40 surface samples and 12 sediment cores , were collected from 52 stations of the Yangtze River Estuary ( YRE) in 2015 and 2016. The 95 % linear prediction intervals ( LPI) and principal components analysis ( PCA) , were conducted to evaluate the metal sources and grain-size effect ( GSE). The in situ physico-chemical properties of pH , Eh , DO , salinity , temperature and turbidity were combined to elucidate the relationships between environmental factors and the fate of heavy metals in the river-estuary-shelf system. This study indicates a decreasing trend of metals in sediments from the estuary towards the adjacent shelf and the river channel and that Zn , Cu and Cr are mainly derived from natural processes throughout the catchment , whereas Pb appears to have anthropogenic inputs via atmospheric deposition. Furthermore , considering the best fit regression lines between the concentrations of Al and heavy metals as well as the deficiencies of the conventional C
