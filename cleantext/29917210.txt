  This paper aims at screening the common differential genes of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease ( CAD) and ischemic cardiomyopathy ( ICM) , and to conduct pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction ( PPI) network analysis for the differential genes. The CAD and ICM datasets were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO) database for human tumors to extract data components of peripheral blood RNA of patients and normal people in GSE71226 and GSE9128 chips; `` limma '' package of `` R '' software was used to screen the differential genes , and `` pheatmap '' package was applied to construct heat maps for the differential genes; Cytoscape , Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integration Discovery ( DAVID) and String platforms were utilized for PPI network analysis , Genome Ontology ( GO) analysis and Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) analysis on the selected differential genes. A total of 575 differential genes were screened from GSE71226 , including 350 genes with up-regulated expression and 225 with down-regulated expression , which was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 , fold change > 1). 75 differential genes were screened from GSE9128 , including 47 genes with up-regulated expression and 28 with down-regulated expression. By virtue of String , DAVID and Cytoscape software , the PPI network diagram was constructed , and GO and KEGG analyses were performed successfully. A total of 8 common differential genes are screened , and functional annotation and pathway analysis are conducted , which is conducive to further studying the interactions between the differentially expressed genes.
