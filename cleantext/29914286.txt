  We explored the role of SNPs within the SLCO1B3 , SLCO1B1 , SLC22A6 , ABCB1 , ABCG2 , SLCO3A1 , CYP2C19 , ABCC2 , SLC22A1 , ABCB11 and NR1I2 genes on voriconazole pharmacokinetics. 233 pediatric patients were enrolled. Drug plasma C SLCO1B3 rs4149117 c. 334 GT/TT ( p = 0.046) , ABCG2 rs13120400 c. 1194 + 928 CC ( p = 0.029) and ABCC2 rs717620 c.-24 GA/AA ( p = 0.025) genotype groups significantly influenced C Understanding how some gene polymorphisms affect the voriconazole pharmacokinetic is essential to optimally dose this agent.
