  Schizophrenia ( SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder with evidence of a strong genetic component in the complex etiologies. Some studies indicated that gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) A receptor Î²2 subunit gene ( GABRB2) was associated with SCZ. Other studies reported a negative association. Moreover , the results of two previous meta-analyses of GABRB2 with SCZ were inconsistent and the sample sizes were limited. Therefore , an updated meta-analysis combined with genome-wide association study ( GWAS) data of the Han Chinese population and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium ( PGC) was performed. Available case-control and family-based genetic data were extracted from association studies , and the GWAS data were included. The findings showed no association between six single-nucleotide polymorphisms of GABRB2 ( rs6556547 , rs1816071 , rs1816072 , rs194072 , rs252944 , and rs187269) and SCZ in a total of 51,491 patients and 74,667 controls. The ethnic subgroup analysis revealed no significant association in Asian populations. Since the PGC data of SCZ ( SCZ-PGC , 2014) contained 3 studies of Asian populations ( 1866 patients and 3418 controls) , only the data of European samples in SCZ-PGC were used for the meta-analysis of the Caucasian population in the present study. The result still showed no association in the Caucasian population. In conclusion , the present meta-analysis on combined data from GWASs of the Han Chinese population and PGC suggested that GABRB2 polymorphisms might not be associated with SCZ.
