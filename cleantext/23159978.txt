Tertiary academic pain center. We report here the operative technique of cervical facet joint cryoneurolysis for patients with cervical facet joint<symptom> pain<symptom>. The procedure is performed under CT-guidance. The lesion<symptom> points are defined with the help of sensory stimulation. Six cervical facet joint denervations were carried out in five patients. All patients had an uneventful course with adequate pain relief. Apart from soreness<symptom> of the paravertebral muscles no severe side effects were encountered.
