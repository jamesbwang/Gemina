  We study two-particle states in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ( SSH) chain with periodic boundary conditions and nearest-neighbor ( NN) interactions. The system is mapped into a problem of a single particle in a two-dimensional ( 2D) SSH lattice with potential walls along specific edges. The 2D SSH model has a trivial Chern number but a non-trivial Zak 's phase , the one-dimensional ( 1D) topological invariant , along specific directions of the lattice , which allow for the presence of topological edge states. Using center-of-mass and relative coordinates , we calculate the energy spectrum of these two-body states for strong interactions and find that , aside from the expected appearance of doublon bands , two extra in-gap bands are present. These are identified as bands of topological states localized at the edges of the internal coordinate , the relative distance between the two particles. As such , the topological states reported here are intrinsically many-body in what concerns their real space manifestation , having no counterpart in single-particle states derived from effective models. Finally , we compare the effect of Hubbard interactions with that of NN interactions to show how the presence of the topological bound states is specific to the latter case.
