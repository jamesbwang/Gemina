This secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial examined persuasion , pressure , and indirect social control among cohabiting couples and the effect of these supports on weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. Couples ( Dyadic multilevel models examined BMI change and differences across role ( treated participant/untreated spouse) and condition ( WW/SG). Prescriptive support predicted BMI change for treated participants in the WW condition only. For treated WW participants , there was no significant decrease in BMI when pressure was high ( +1 Considering both the type and context of support for weight management is worthwhile. Intervention participants had access to treatment resources that may have engendered more effective responses to spouses ' concerns or a sense of obligation to their spouse ( indirect social control) , whereas pressures to lose weight-while engaged in treatment-may have undermined behavior-change efforts.
