  Salinomycin is an antibiotic that has recently been introduced as a novel and effective anti-cancer drug. In this study , PLGA nanofibers ( NFs) containing salinomycin ( Sali) were fabricated by electrospinning for the first time. The biodegradable PLGA NFs had stability for approximately 30 days and exhibited a sustained release of the drug for at least a 2-week period. Cytotoxicity of the NFs + Sali was evaluated on human glioblastoma U-251 cells and more than 50 % of the treated cells showed apoptosis in 48 h. Moreover , NFs + Sali was effective to induce intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS) leading to cell apoptosis. Gene expression studies also revealed the capability of the NFs + Sali<pathogen> to upregulate tumor suppressor Rbl1 and Rbl2 as well as Caspase 3 while decreasing Wnt signaling pathway. In general , the results indicated anti-tumor activity of the Sali-loaded NFs suggesting their potential applications as implantable drug delivery systems in the brain upon surgical resection of the tumor.
