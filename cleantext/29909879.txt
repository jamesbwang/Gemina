  EQ-5D-5L valuation studies previously reported many inconsistent responses in time trade-off ( TTO) data. A number of possible elements , including ordering effects of the valuation tasks , mistakes at the sorting question , and interviewers ' ( learning) effects , may contribute to their inconsistency. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two modifications on consistency of TTO data in The Netherlands ( NL) and Hong Kong ( HK): ( 1) separating the valuation of the Better than Dead ( BTD) and Worse than Dead ( WTD) states; and ( 2) Implementation of feedback ( FB) module by offering an opportunity to review TTO responses. A crossover design with two study arms was used to test the effect of the modifications. In each jurisdiction , six interviewers were involved where half the interviewers started using the standard version , and the other half started with the split version. Each version was switched after every 25 ( NL) or 30 ( HK) interviews until 400 interviews were completed. In the NL and HK , 404 and 403 respondents participated , respectively. With the use of the FB module , the proportion of respondents with inconsistent responses was lowered from 17.8 % to 10.6 % ( P < 0.001) in NL and from 31.8 % to 22.3 % ( P = 0.003) in HK. The result of separating the valuation of BTD and WTD states was not straightforward because it reduced the inconsistency rate in NL but not in HK. The results support implementation of the FB module to promote the consistency of the data. The separation of the BTD and WTD task is not supported.
