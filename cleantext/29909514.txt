  Single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy ( SADI-S) is a modification of Roux-en-Y duodenal switch ( RYDS). Long-term data on this operation is lacking in the literature. We reviewed our mid-term data of this RYDS modification. To analyze the outcomes with SADI-S at 4 years. Data from patients who underwent a primary SADI-S procedure performed by three surgeons at a single institution from June 2013 through February 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. All revision bariatric surgeries were excluded. Regression analyses were performed for all follow-up weight<symptom> loss<symptom> data. There were 437 patients in our database. The pre-operative mean body mass index ( BMI) was 49.8 Â± 8.8 kg/m SADI-S is a safe and effective procedure in both short- and mid-term data points. Diabetes resolution and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> appear similar to traditional RYDS and better than RYGB.
