  Fluorine-18 labelled prosthetic groups ( PGs) are often necessary for radiolabelling sensitive biological molecules such as peptides and proteins. Several shortcomings , however , often diminish the final yield of radiotracer. In an attempt to provide higher yielding and operationally efficient tools for radiolabelling biological molecules , we describe herein the first radiochemical synthesis of (
