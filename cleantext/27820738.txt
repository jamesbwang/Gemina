  Paracetamol is the most commonly used analgesic in older people , and is mainly dosed according to empirical dosing guidelines. However , the pharmacokinetics and thereby the effects of paracetamol can be influenced by physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> occurring with ageing. To investigate the steps needed to reach more evidence-based paracetamol dosing regimens in older people , we applied the concepts used in the paediatric study decision tree. A search was performed to retrieve studies on paracetamol pharmacokinetics and safety in older people ( > 60 years) or studies that performed a ( sub) analysis of pharmacokinetics and/or safety in older people. Of 6088 articles identified , 259 articles were retained after title and abstract screening. Further abstract and full-text screening identified 27 studies , of which 20 described pharmacokinetics and seven safety. These studies revealed no changes in absorption with ageing. A decreased ( 3.9-22.9 %) volume of distribution ( V
