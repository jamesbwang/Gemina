  To investigate the prognosis of patients with adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( B-ALL) with Ikaros family zinc-finger 1 ( IKZF1) mutation and determine the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT) in improving the clinical outcome , we detected the IKZF1 mutation and BCR-ABL fusion gene at diagnosis in the bone<disease> marrow of 164 adult patients with B-ALL , and analyzed the clinical data of these patients retrospectively. Our analysis showed that grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease and IKZF1 mutation in the transplantation group and age and IKZF1 mutation in the non-transplantation group were independent factors for poor prognosis by univariate and multivariate analyses.The 3-year overall survival ( OS) and leukemia-free survival ( LFS) rates were much lower in the IKZF1 +/ BCR-ABL + subgroup than in the IKZF1 +/ BCR-ABL- and IKZF1-/ BCR-ABL- subgroups in both the transplantation and non-transplantation groups. The 3-year OS and LFS rates were significantly higher in the transplantation group than in the non-transplantation group with IKZF1 mutation.The study demonstrated that IKZF1 mutation was an independent factor indicating the poor prognosis of adult B-ALL and much worse prognosis in the BCR-ABL + subgroup in both non-transplantation and transplantation groups. However , allo-HSCT significantly improved the OS and LFS of patients and also their clinical outcomes.
