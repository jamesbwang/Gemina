  Transposable elements represent nearly half of mammalian genomes and are generally described as parasites , or `` junk DNA. '' The LINE1 retrotransposon is the most abundant class and is thought to be deleterious for cells , yet it is paradoxically highly expressed during early development. Here , we report that LINE1 plays essential roles in mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs) and pre-implantation embryos. In ESCs , LINE1 acts as a nuclear RNA scaffold that recruits Nucleolin and Kap1/Trim28 to repress Dux , the master activator of a transcriptional program specific to the 2-cell embryo. In parallel , LINE1 RNA mediates binding of Nucleolin and Kap1 to rDNA , promoting rRNA synthesis and ESC self-renewal. In embryos , LINE1 RNA is required for Dux silencing , synthesis of rRNA , and exit from the 2-cell stage. The results reveal an essential partnership between LINE1 RNA , Nucleolin , Kap1 , and peri-nucleolar chromatin in the regulation of transcription , developmental potency , and ESC self-renewal.
