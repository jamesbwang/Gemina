  The determinants of prognosis in patients with colorectal liver metastases ( CLM) have been traditionally searched among the tumoral factors , either of the primary colorectal tumor or of the CLM. While many different scoring systems have been developed based on those clinic-pathological factors with disparate results , there has been the introduction of genetic biological markers that added a theranostic perspective. More recently , other important elements , such as those factors related to the host immune system , have been proposed as determinants of prognosis of CLM patients. In the present work , we review the current prognostic factors of CLM patients as well as the burgeoning shifting paradigm of prognostication that relies on the host immune system.
