  In 2010 , a new subtype of salivary gland cancer ( SGC) , ( mammary analogue) secretory carcinoma ( SC) , was defined , characterized by the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. As clinical behavior and outcome data of this histological subtype tumor are still sparse , we aimed to describe the clinicopathological course and outcome of a series of translocation positive SC patients. We re-evaluated the pathological diagnosis of a subset of SGCs , diagnosed in 4 of 8 Dutch head and neck centers. Subsequently , tumors with a morphological resemblance to SC were tested for the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene using RT-PCR. Furthermore , patients prospectively diagnosed with SC were included. The clinical characteristics and outcomes were retrieved from the patient files. Thirty-one patients with ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene positive SC were included. The median age was 49 years , 17 patients ( 55 %) were male. Eighteen tumors ( 58 %) arose in the parotid<symptom> gland. One patient presented with lymph node metastasis. All patients underwent tumor resection and 4 patients had a neck dissection. Four patients had re-resection and 15 patients ( 48 %) received postoperative radiotherapy. One patient developed a local recurrence , no regional recurrences or distant metastases were observed. After a median follow-up of 49 months the 5- and 10-year overall survival were 95 % , the 5- and 10-year disease free survival were 89 %. The clinical course of SC is favorable with a low rate of locoregional recurrence and excellent survival. Given the low incidence of nodal metastases , elective neck treatment , i.e. surgery and/or radiotherapy , does not seem to be indicated.
