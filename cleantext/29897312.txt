  To identify the potential challenges and barriers to the implementation of Advanced Physiotherapy Practice ( APP) in Ghana. A basic interpretive qualitative study design was conducted , with a semi-structured focus group comprising eight physiotherapists and a one-to-one interview with the director of orthopedic surgery in the second largest hospital in Ghana. Participants were sampled purposefully to ensure they had a clear understanding of APP. Discussions were audio recorded , transcribed , coded and thematic analysis was performed. Four key themes were identified as potential challenges to the implementation of APP in Ghana. Theme 1 Jurisdictional Disputes: Physiotherapists believed doctors will not accept the practice , while the doctor interviewed was willing to accept the practice. Theme 2: Management Support: Support from management was identified as a potential barrier to APP implementation due to workplace culture and liability. Theme 3 Change in Law and Policy: APP could be hindered if there is no legislative support and policies in place. Theme 4 Postgraduate Training: This was identified as key to the implementation of APP since there is no such level of training in Ghana. Barriers to health-care programs are often not identified and addressed prior to their implementation in developing countries , leading to program failure. Addressing these four barriers and challenges could ensure the successful implementation of APP in Ghana. APP has the potential to improve access to rural health-care delivery and augment the shortage of health professionals in developing countries.
