  To investigate the relationship of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics ( PK) and overall survival ( OS) in patients with advanced melanoma and non-small cell carcinoma ( NSCLC). PK dependencies in OS were evaluated across three pembrolizumab studies of either 200 mg or 2-10 mg/kg Q3W. Kaplan-Meier ( K-M) plots of OS , stratified by dose , exposure , and baseline clearance were assessed per indication and study. A Cox Proportional Hazards model was implemented to explore imbalances of typical prognostic factors in high/low NSCLC CL </SPAN> These data support the lack of dose or exposure dependency in pembrolizumab OS for melanoma and NSCLC between 2-10 mg/kg.
