  This study compared the functional and physiological adaptations induced by concurrent training ( CT) performed with repetitions to concentric failure and not to failure in elderly men. Fifty-two individuals ( 66.2 Â± 5.2 years) completed the pre- and post-measurements and were divided into three groups: repetitions to failure ( RFG , n = 17); repetitions not to failure ( NFG , n = 20); and repetitions not to failure with total volume equalized to that in the RFG ( ENFG , n = 15). The participants ' sit-to-stand ability , timed-up-and-go ( TUG) , muscle power output in squat jump ( SJ) and countermovement jump ( CMJ) , peak oxygen uptake ( VO
