  Emotional processing appears to be interlocked with perception , cognition , motivation , and action. These interactions are supported by the brain 's large-scale non-modular anatomical and functional architectures. An important component of this organization involves characterizing the brain in terms of networks. Two aspects of brain networks are discussed: brain networks should be considered as inherently overlapping ( not disjoint) and dynamic ( not static). Recent work on multivariate pattern analysis shows that affective dimensions can be detected in the activity of distributed neural systems that span cortical and subcortical regions. More broadly , the paper considers how we should think of causation in complex systems like the brain , so as to inform the relationship between emotion and other mental aspects , such as cognition.
