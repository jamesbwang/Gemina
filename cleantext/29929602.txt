  Chronic itching<symptom> can be frustrating for patients and providers , and patients are not always willing to accept that their psychiatric health has an impact on their skin. Psychogenic pruritus is defined as itch not related to dermatologic or systemic causes. When a patient presents with pruritus , regardless of the presumed cause , the standard work-up should include a thorough history , dermatologic examination , and laboratory examinations or biopsies as needed. If no medical source is found , the provider must work in partnership with the patient to explore other causes and that may include acknowledging and treating underlying psychiatric conditions.
