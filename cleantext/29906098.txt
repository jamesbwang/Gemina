  In this work , we demonstrate a simple , versatile , and real-time motion guidance strategy for artificial microengines and motile microorganisms in a ferrofluid by dynamic topographical pathways ( DTPs) , which are assembled from superparamagnetic nanoparticles in response to external magnetic field ( H). In this general strategy , the DTPs can exert anisotropic resistance forces on autonomously moving microengines and thus regulate their orientation. As the DTPs with different directions and lengths can be reversibly and swiftly assembled in response to the applied H , the microengines in the ferrofluid can be guided on demand with controlled motion directions and trajectories , including circular , elliptical , straight-line , semi-sine , and sinusoidal trajectories. The as-demonstrated control strategy obviates reliance on the customized responses of micromotors and applies to autonomously propelling agents swimming both in bulk and near substrate walls. Furthermore , the microengines ( or motile microorganisms) in a ferrofluid can be considered as an integrated system , and it may inspire the development of intelligent systems with cooperative functions for biomedical and environmental applications.
