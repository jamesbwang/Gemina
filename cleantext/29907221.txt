  Most race/ethnicity-oriented investigations focus on Caucasian Americans ( whites) and African Americans ( blacks) , leaving Asians , Hispanic white ( Hispanics) , and other minorities less well studied. Adjuvant chemotherapy ( CT) after curative resection is critical to patients with locally advanced colon cancer ( LACC). We studied the racial disparities in the adjuvant CT of LACC to aid in selecting optimal treatments for people from different races/ethnicities in this era of precision medicine. Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC) stage II or III colon cancer ( CC) ( together termed as LACC) were included based on Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results cancer registry-Medicare linked databases. The log-rank test and Cox multivariate regression analysis were performed to investigate the racial/ethnic disparities in cohorts divided according to the regimen of adjuvant CT.. In the LACC patients who did not receive adjuvant CT , Asian patients had better survival than other groups ( all , P < 0.05). For the fluoropyrimidine cohort , the survival of Asian patients was better than that of whites , blacks , and other minorities ( all , P < 0.05). For the fluoropyrimidine with oxaliplatin cohort , other minorities had superior survival to other groups ( all , P < 0.05). Similar findings were demonstrated for patients with AJCC stage II and III CC , and the observed better survival persisted after adjustments in the Cox models. Among LACC patients not receiving adjuvant CT , Asians achieved better survival than other races/ethnicities. Superior survival was also observed for Asians in the fluoropyrimidine cohort and for other minorities in the fluoropyrimidine with oxaliplatin cohort for AJCC stage III CC.
