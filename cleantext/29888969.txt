  To assess the influence of endorectal filling ( EF) on rectal cancer staging. 47 patients who underwent a staging MRI of rectal cancer in the period from 2011 to 2014 were included. The MRI protocol included T The interobserver agreement for T-staging with and without EF-MRI showed a poor agreement between both readers ( weighted κ = 0.156 , weighted κ = 0.037 , respectively). Tumours tended to be overstaged more prominently with EF-MRI. The accuracy of predicting the pathological T-stage slightly improved from 55 % with EF to 64 % without EF for Reader 1 and from 59 to 68 % for Reader 2 , respectively. The distance of the tumour to the anorectal junction increased from 33.9 to 49.3 mm ( p < 0.001) after EF for Reader 2. EF-MRI did not significantly influence the number of ( suspicious) lymph nodes and distance to the mesorectal fascia. EF-MRI did not lead to an improved tumour staging and it has the potential to influence the distance to a key anatomical landmark. EF-MRI is therefore not recommended in primary staging rectal cancer. Advances in knowledge: EF-MRI may not be used as an additional tool to stage rectal cancer patients , as it does not seem to facilitate in locoregionally staging the disease.
