  Raised hemoglobinA1c ( HbA1c) is an indicator of pre-diabetes , which is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease. However , the detailed morphological characteristics of non-culprit plaques in acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) patients remain largely unknown. A total of 305 non-culprit plaques from 216 ACS patients were analyzed by intravascular optical coherence tomography. These patients were divided into three groups according to the serum glycosylated hemoglobin level: normal HbA1c ( < 5.7 %) , pre-diabetes with raised HbA1c ( 5.7-6.4 %) and diabetes mellitus ( DM). Plaques in patients with raised HbA1c had a longer lipid length ( 17.0 ± 8.3 mm vs. 13.9 ± 7.2 mm , P = 0.004) and greater lipid index ( 2775.0 ± 1694.0 mm ° vs. 1592.1 ± 981.2 mm ° , P = 0.001) than those with normal HbA1c but were similar to DM. The prevalence of calcification in patients with raised HbA1c was significantly higher ( 38.7 % vs. 26.3 % , P = 0.048) than normal HbA1c but was similar to DM. The percentage of macrophage infiltration in the DM group was higher than that in the normal HbA1c group ( 20.5 % vs. 7.4 % , P = 0.005). Compared to patients with normal HbA1c , the non-culprit plaques in ACS patients with raised HbA1c had more typical vulnerable features but were similar to DM.
