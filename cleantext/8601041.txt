  Waldenström 's Macroglobulinemia ( WM) is a rare lymphoma caused by the overproduction of immunoglobulin M ( IgM). The elevated level of IgM causes serum hyperviscosity , cold agglutinins , and cryoglobulinemia. Anemia<symptom> is also present because of impaired production of erythrocytes. For these reasons , placing a patient with WM on cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) requires careful preparation. In this case , the patient was a 73-year-old male with known Waldenström 's disease who required coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This report details the perioperative considerations used for successful CPB on a Waldenström 's patient. Critical to this case was the use of plasmapheresis before surgery. Temperature management and acid/base status were carefully controlled. A successful coronary revascularization surgery was performed. Many of the Wadenstrom 's disease complications expected on CPB failed to materialize.
