  To develop a prediction model for the chance of successful external cephalic version ( ECV). This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter , open-label randomized controlled trial that assessed the effectiveness of atosiban compared to fenoterol as uterine relaxant during ECV in women with a singleton fetus in breech presentation with a gestational age of 36 weeks or more. Potential predictors included maternal , pregnancy , fetal , and treatment characteristics and were recorded in all participants. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with a stepwise backward selection procedure was used to construct a prediction model for the occurrence of successful ECV. Model performance was assessed using calibration and discrimination. We included a total of 818 women with an overall ECV success rate of 37 %. Ten predictive factors were identified with the stepwise selection procedure to be associated with a successful ECV: fenoterol as uterine relaxant , nulliparity , Caucasian ethnicity , gestational age at ECV , Amniotic Fluid Index , type of breech presentation , placental location , breech engagement , possibility to palpate the head and relaxation of the uterus. Our model showed good calibration and a good discriminative ability with a c-statistic of 0.78 ( 95 % CI 0.75 to 0.81). Prediction of success of ECV seems feasible with a model showing good performance. This can be used in clinical practice after external validation.
