  The genotoxicity methods applied to rats are tests that can detect any damage , including changes in the number of chromosomes or in the structure of chromosomes , and nucleotide changes with structural abnormality in the DNA of animal cells. However , the method of teratogenicity is used to detect the effects of chemicals which cause congenital defects in living organisms. This study contains information about the effectiveness , reliability , ways of application , and methodology of genotoxic and teratogenic methods applied in vivo in rats.
