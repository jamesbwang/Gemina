  One of the hallmark experiments of quantum transport is the observation of the quantized resistance in a point contact in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Being formed with split gate technology , these structures represent in an ideal manner equilibrium reservoirs which are connected only through a few electron mode channel. It has been a long standing goal to achieve similar experimental conditions also in superconductors. Here we demonstrate the formation of a superconducting quantum point contact ( SQPC) with split gate technology in a two-dimensional superconductor , utilizing the unique gate tunability of the superfluid at the LaAlO
