  The three-electron two-center ( 3e-2c) bond plays an important role in structures and electron communication in biological systems involving cationic sulfur compounds. Although the nature of 3e-2c bonds and their theoretical formalism have attracted great interest , direct spectral identifications of 3e-2c-bound molecules are scarce. We observed the infrared spectra of the weakly 3e-2c-bound CH
