  Candiduria is increasingly frequent in hospitalized debilitated patients. We aimed to evaluate the approach of clinicians to candiduria in the oldest old , and its effect on clearance and mortality. An observational study without intervention was carried out during 2012 and 2013 in three Spanish hospitals over patients with nosocomial candiduria aged 80 and over. Following a diagnostic algorithm , we assessed the appropriateness of antifungal therapy and analyzed the impact of the clinical approach ( antifungal therapy , antibiotics discontinuation and catheter removal or replacement) on the outcome ( mortality at 60 days and resolution , persistence or recurrence of candiduria). Hundred and forty eight patients were included. Symptomatology was attributable to candiduria in 31 instances and 19 asymptomatic patients were found at risk of developing candidemia. In response to culture-results , 77 ( 52 %) of patients were treated with antifungals , mainly fluconazole ( 97.4 %). The use of pharmacological therapy was appropriate ( P < 0.05) but subtherapeutical doses of fluconazole were widely used and follow-up samples were scarcely submitted. At 60 days of diagnosis the mortality was high ( 29.7 %). The replacement or removal of the catheter resulted in a decrease in mortality and the use of antifungal treatment was associated with recurrence ( P < 0.05). In the absence of clinical practice guidelines with enough evidence , our study suggests that catheter removal should always be tried in the elderly with candiduria , since it reduces the mortality. The repetition of culture should help to better characterize the asymptomatic episodes , which are predominant , and to reduce the use of antifungals.
