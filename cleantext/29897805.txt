  Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a potent evolutionary force. Although additive genetic variation and novel combinations of parental genes theoretically increase the potential for hybrid species to adapt , few empirical studies have investigated the adaptive potential within a hybrid species. Here , we address whether genomic contingencies , adaptation to climate , or diet best explain divergence in beak morphology using genomically diverged island<disease> populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae from Crete , Corsica , and Sicily. Populations vary significantly in beak morphology both between and within islands of origin. Temperature seasonality best explains population divergence in beak size. Interestingly , beak shape along all significant dimensions of variation was best explained by annual precipitation , genomic composition , and their interaction , suggesting a role for contingencies. Moreover , beak shape similarity to a parent species correlates with proportion of the genome inherited from that species , consistent with the presence of contingencies. In conclusion , adaptation to local conditions and genomic contingencies arising from putatively independent hybridization events jointly explain beak morphology in the Italian sparrow. Hence , hybridization may induce contingencies and restrict evolution in certain directions dependent on the genetic background.
