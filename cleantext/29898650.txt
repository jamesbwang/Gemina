  The number of people that are overweight and obese is continuously increasing both in the adult and adolescent populations. Coinciding with this is the increased prevalence of health problems such as type 2 diabetes ( T2D). Bariatric surgery is the only proven long-term treatment of obesity and may induce remission of T2D , although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The translational studies presented here might provide insight on the mechanism of steady-state energy balance<symptom> of the obese phenotype using a special time-restricted feeding regimen for weight<symptom> loss<symptom> during the steady-state energy balance<symptom>; and mechanism by vagal blocking therapy ( vBLoc Â® therapy) as a new treatment for obesity; and possible mechanism behind the remission of T2D following gastric bypass surgery.
