  Hyaluronan ( hyaluronic acid , HA) apparently improves sperm survival in vitro and in vivo ( oviduct) , maintaining sperm motility and inducing capacitation , but not acrosome exocytosis , either by direct action as a macromolecule or via CD44 membrane receptors. This study explored ejaculated , liquid-extended pig spermatozoa to ascertain ( i) the presence ( Western blotting) and specific location ( immunocytochemistry) of the CD44 receptor , using a specific monoclonal commercial antibody; ( ii) whether the CD44 receptor changed location when exposed to bicarbonate , a capacitating trigger , in vitro; and ( iii) whether the addition of HA , of molecular size comparable to that produced in the oviduct sperm reservoir ( 0.0625 to 2.0 mg/ml; 0 HA: control) , to semen extenders would improve sperm liquid storage in vitro or cryosurvival post-freezing. Variables tested were sperm velocity and progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> ( Qualisperm ™) , sperm viability and acrosome status , membrane integrity and early destabilization , mitochondrial activation , and superoxide production ( flow cytometry). The CD44 receptor presence in ejaculated , liquid-stored AI boar spermatozoa , as confirmed by a porcine-specific monoclonal antibody , maintained its membrane location under in vitro capacitation-inducing conditions. HA exposure to 24- , 48- , or 72-h liquid-stored ( 17-20ºC) spermatozoa lowered sperm velocity in membrane-intact spermatozoa , but increased mitochondrial superoxide production. Finally , HA addition during cooling did not improve cryosurvival but did increase mitochondrial activation and membrane destabilization in surviving cells. These results confirm the existence of a CD44 receptor in pig spermatozoa , but the usefulness of adding HA for long-term storage or cryopreservation of liquid-stored , extended boar semen remains in question , thereby warranting further non-empirical analyses of HA-sperm membrane interactions.
