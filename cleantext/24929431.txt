  We provide a review of monogenic diabetes in young children and adolescents with a focus on recognition , management , and pharmacological treatment. Monogenic forms of diabetes account for approximately 1-2 % of diabetes in children and adolescents , and its incidence has increased in recent years due to greater awareness and wider availability of genetic testing. Monogenic diabetes is due to single gene defects that primarily affect beta cell function with more than 30 different genes reported. Children with antibody-negative , C-peptide-positive diabetes should be evaluated and genetically tested for monogenic diabetes. Accurate genetic diagnosis impacts treatment in the most common types of monogenic diabetes , including the use of sulfonylureas in place of insulin or other glucose-lowering agents or discontinuing pharmacologic treatment altogether. Diagnosis of monogenic diabetes can significantly improve patient care by enabling prediction of the disease course and guiding appropriate management and treatment.
