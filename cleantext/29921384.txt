  Shockwave therapy has found its place in the medical treatment of various diseases of the locomotor system such as acute fracture , nonunion , chronic tendinitis and pseudarthrosis. Focused shock<symptom> waves enable maximum energy in the therapeutic zone , and depth of penetration can be adjusted. Radial shockwave therapy primarily affects superficial tissues , so its application in medicine is doubtful. Our study aimed to assess long bone fracture healing in regard to soft tissues. For this investigation , 84 female Wistar rats were divided into a focused shockwave group ( n = 36) , a radial shockwave group ( n = 36) and a control group ( n = 12). Conclusively , long bone fracture repair was enhanced in the shockwave groups. Comparison between focused shock<symptom> waves and radial shock<symptom> waves suggested that this latter strongly stimulated the processes of the healing , as 75 % of vascular spaces were VEGF-A positive on the 5th day of bone healing , and 85 % on the 22nd day of healing.
