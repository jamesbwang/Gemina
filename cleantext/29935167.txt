  The distal tubule ( DT) helps regulate blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and electrolytes. We describe a novel , autosomal recessive , morphofunctional DT abnormality in inbred mice evident as columnar alternations and age-related cystic changes. This abnormality developed in both sexes of DBA/2Cr. Similar phenotypes were observed in A/J , C3H/He , DBA/1J , and FVB/N strains , but not in AKR/N , BALB/c , or C57BL/6N strains. In DBA/2Cr , abnormal DT localized to straight and convoluted segments and showed IL-36Î± DT injury marker expression. However , DT epithelial proliferation , examined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation , was not remarkably altered with the progression of abnormality. Abnormal DT epithelial cells in DBA/2Cr displayed elongated primary cilia , loose intercellular adhesions , and numerous vesicles with altered localization of CD9 , Na
