  As the major glia in PNS , Schwann cells play a critical role in peripheral nerve injury repair. Finding an efficient approach to promote Schwann cell activation might facilitate peripheral nerve repair. Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been shown to regulate gene expression and take part in many biological processes. However , the role of lncRNAs in peripheral nerve regeneration is not fully understood. In this study , we obtained a global lncRNA portrayal following sciatic nerve injury in male rats using microarray and further investigated one of these dys-regulated lncRNAs , TNXA-PS1 , confirming its vital role in regulating Schwann cells. Silencing TNAX-PS1 could promote Schwann cell migration and mechanism analyses showed that TNXA-PS1 might exert its regulatory role by sponging miR-24-3p/ miR-152-3p and affecting dual specificity phosphatase 1 ( Dusp1) expression. Systematic lncRNA expression profiling of sciatic nerve segments following nerve injury in rats suggested lncRNA TNXA-PS1 as a key regulator of Schwann cell migration , providing a potential therapeutic target for nerve injury repair.
