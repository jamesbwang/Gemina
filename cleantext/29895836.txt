  To assess the prognostic significance of an early normal/mildly abnormal conventional EEG ( cEEG) on seizure<symptom> risk in neonates undergoing therapeutic hypothermia<symptom>. We reviewed the video-EEG recordings from a large cohort of neonates treated with therapeutic hypothermia<symptom> for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy from 2008 to 2017 in a single tertiary center. Continuous video-EEG was started as soon as possible ( median 8.2 h) and continued throughout hypothermia<symptom> and rewarming. We studied those neonates with a normal/mildly abnormal EEG during the first 24 h of monitoring. A total of 331 neonates were treated with hypothermia<symptom> and 323 had cEEG recordings available for review; 99 were excluded because of a moderately/severely abnormal cEEG background and/or seizure<symptom> during the first 24 h of recording , and an additional eight because of early rewarming. The remaining 216 had a normal/mildly abnormal cEEG in the first 24 h. None of these patients subsequently developed seizures<symptom>. A normal/mildly abnormal cEEG during the first 24 h indicates a very low risk of subsequent seizures<symptom>. This suggests that cEEG monitoring can be safely discontinued after 24 h if it has remained normal or excessively discontinuous and no seizures<symptom> are detected , limiting the need for this resource-intensive and expensive tool.
