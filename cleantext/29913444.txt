  The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinib is primarily utilized for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma. The drug is at least partially effective by triggering suicidal tumor cell death. Side effects of afatinib treatment include anemia<symptom> At least in theory , afatinib induced anemia<symptom> could be secondary to stimulation of suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis , characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Signaling potentially stimulating eryptosis include increase of cytosolic Ca2 + activity ( ( Ca2 +) i) , induction of oxidative stress , and increase of ceramide abundance. The present study explored , whether afatinib induces eryptosis and , if so , whether its effect involves Ca2 + entry , oxidative stress , and/or ceramide. Flow cytometry was employed to quantify phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface from annexin-V-binding , cell volume from forward scatter , ( Ca2 +) i from Fluo3-fluorescence , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) abundance from DCFDA dependent fluorescence , and ceramide abundance utilizing specific antibodies. A 48 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to afatinib ( ≥ 4 µg/ml) significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells and significantly decreased forward scatter. Afatinib significantly increased Fluo3-fluorescence , DCFDA fluorescence and ceramide abundance. The effect of afatinib on annexin-V-binding and forward scatter was significantly blunted by removal of extracellular Ca2 +. Afatinib triggers phospholipid scrambling of the erythrocyte cell membrane , an effect at least in part due to Ca2 + entry , oxidative stress , and ceramide.
