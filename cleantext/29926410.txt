  This chapter describes protocols for mass spectrometry ( MS) applied to the characterization of ganglioside structures and the determination of ganglioside contents. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization ( MALDI) and electrospray ionization ( ESI) are often used to ionize biological materials and this chapter covers three protocols for atmospheric pressure MALDI MS ( AP-MALDI MS) , liquid chromatography-ESI MS ( LC-ESI MS) , and LC-ESI MS with multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM). Purified gangliosides were used in AP-MALDI MS analyses while crude preparations of gangliosides were subjected to LC-ESI MS and LC-ESI MS with MRM. The LC protocol includes conditions for both reversed-phase and normal-phase column chromatography.
