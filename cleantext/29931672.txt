  Parainfluenza virus infection is a common respiratory illness in children. Although lncRNAs are novel regulators of virus-induced innate immunity , a systemic attempt to characterize the differential expression of lncRNAs upon parainfluenza virus infection is lacking. In this report , we identify 207 lncRNAs and 166 mRNAs differentially expressed in SeV-infected HEK293T cells by microarray. The functional annotation analysis reveals that differentially regulated transcripts are predominantly involved in the host antiviral response pathway. The lncRNAs with the potential to regulate SeV-induced antiviral response are identified by building the lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network. Furthermore , silencing lncRNA ENST00000565297 results in reduced type I IFN signaling upon SeV infection. These catalogs may facilitate future analysis of the functions of lncRNAs in innate immunity and related diseases.
