  Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses ( HR-HPVs , including HPV-16 , HPV-18 , HPV-31) plays a central aetiologic role in the development of cervical carcinoma. The transforming properties of HR-HPVs mainly reside in viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. E6 protein degrades the tumour suppressor p53 and abrogates cell cycle checkpoints. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A ( CIP2A) is an oncoprotein that is involved in the carcinogenesis of many human malignancies. Our previous data showed that CIP2A was overexpressed in cervical cancer. However , the regulation of CIP2A by HPV-16E6 remains to be elucidated. In this study , we demonstrated that HPV-16E6 significantly up-regulated CIP2A mRNA and protein expression in a p53-degradation-dependent manner. Knockdown of CIP2A by siRNA inhibited viability and DNA synthesis and caused G1 cell cycle arrest of 16E6-expressing cells. Knockdown of CIP2A resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( Cdk1) and Cdk2. Although CIP2A has been reported to stabilize c-Myc by inhibiting PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of c-Myc , we have presented evidence that the regulation of Cdk1 and Cdk2 by CIP2A is dependent on transcription factor B-Myb rather than c-Myc. Taken together , our study reveals the role of CIP2A in abrogating the G1 checkpoint in HPV-16E6-expressing cells and helps in understanding the molecular basis of HPV-induced oncogenesis.
