  In many Internet of Things ( IoT) applications , large numbers of small sensor data are delivered in the network , which may cause heavy traffics. To reduce the number of messages delivered from the sensor devices to the IoT server , a promising approach is to aggregate several small IoT messages into a large packet before they are delivered through the network. When the packets arrive at the destination , they are disaggregated into the original IoT messages. In the existing solutions , packet aggregation/disaggregation is performed by software at the server , which results in long delays and low throughputs. To resolve the above issue , this paper utilizes the programmable Software Defined Networking ( SDN) switch to program quick packet aggregation and disaggregation. Specifically , we consider the Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processor ( P4) technology. We design and develop novel P4 programs for aggregation and disaggregation in commercial P4 switches. Our study indicates that packet aggregation can be achieved in a P4 switch with its line rate ( without extra packet processing cost). On the other hand , to disaggregate a packet that combines
