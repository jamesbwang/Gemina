  To investigate the association between Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms ( BsmI , TaqI and FokI) and type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients in north eastern India. This was a case control study with 40 cases of type 2 diabetes and 20 controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs) of BsmI ( rs1544410) , TaqI ( rs731236) and FokI ( rs2228570) by polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing. Genotype distribution and allelic frequencies were compared between patients and controls. Data was expressed as mean Â± standard deviation. Chi square test and t test were used to compare groups. Statistical analysis was done using SAS version 9.3 software. Body<symptom> weight and BMI were significantly associated with VDR polymorphisms BsmI and TaqI while BsmI was significantly associated with HbA1C. Vitamin D deficiency was significantly greater in cases than controls. The frequency of the heterozygous genotype of the BsmI polymorphism was significantly greater in type 2 diabetics than in controls. Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms are associated with type 2 diabetes in our population and require larger scale studies to be considered as possible risk factors or type 2 diabetes mellitus.
