  This article discusses the approach of the Clinical Ethics Consultation Advisory Committee ( CECA) in developing A Case-Based Study Guide for Addressing Patient-Centered Ethical Issues in Health Care. This article addresses the processes used by the CECA , its use of pivot questions intended to encourage critical reflection , and the target audience of this work. It first considers the salience of case studies in general education and their relevance for training ethics consultants. Second , it discusses the enfolding approach used in presenting the case material designed to engage the trainee in the details of the case while stimulating critical reflection. And , third , this article briefly comments on the target audience with the caveat that even superbly developed cases are prone to misuse , although that prospect should not deter their development.
