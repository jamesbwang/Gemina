  The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify clinical trials of MDS and AML that included patient-reported outcome ( PRO) instruments , and to summarize the symptom and other health related quality of life ( HRQOL) concepts most frequently assessed and the PRO instruments that were used. Sixteen manuscripts describing 14 distinct trials met all criteria ( i.e. , phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for MDS or AML which included PRO assessment) and were published between 1996-2017. In trials evaluating anemia<symptom> , PRO scores showed significant improvement in relevant domains ( e.g. fatigue<symptom> , function) among patients identified as responders. In trials evaluating the impact of anti-cancer therapies , improvements the baseline to end of treatment were observed in physical functioning and HRQOL , however the rates of missing data in many of the trials was high or unreported. PRO instruments have the ability to capture changes over time in patients ' function and well-being , and PRO instruments and guidance documents are available to support the assessment of HRQOL in AML/MDS clinical trials.
