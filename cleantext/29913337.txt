  A simple , fast and green homogeneous liquid-liquid microextraction ( HLLME) method based on solvents volume ratio alteration ( SVRA) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS) was developed for the preconcentration and determination of caffeine in tea and coffee samples. In the proposed HLLME-SVRA method , the primary extraction from solid samples was achieved by a 2:1 ethanol-water mixture. A micro-volume of dichloromethane ( DCM) formed a homogeneous solvent with this mixture after choosing an appropriate volume ratio between the three solvents. After vigorous shaking , an extra volume of water was added that resulted in phase separation due to the solvents volume ratio alteration. As a result , complete extraction of caffeine was achieved after centrifugation. The sedimented dichloromethane phase was then injected into GC-MS for the analysis. The influence of a number of parameters influencing the efficiency of the extraction was investigated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions , an enrichment factor of 11 , a limit of detection of 0.05 Î¼g mL
