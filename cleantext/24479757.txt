  In the era of precision medicine , cancer therapy can be tailored to an individual patient based on the genomic profile of a tumour. Despite the ever-increasing abundance of cancer genomic data , linking mutation profiles to drug efficacy remains a challenge. Herein , we report Cancer Drug Response profile scan ( CDRscan) a novel deep learning model that predicts anticancer drug responsiveness based on a large-scale drug screening assay data encompassing genomic profiles of 787 human cancer cell lines and structural profiles of 244 drugs. CDRscan employs a two-step convolution architecture , where the genomic mutational fingerprints of cell lines and the molecular fingerprints of drugs are processed individually , then merged by ` virtual docking ' , an in silico modelling of drug treatment. Analysis of the goodness-of-fit between observed and predicted drug response revealed a high prediction accuracy of CDRscan ( R
