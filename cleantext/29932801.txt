  Sirt1 promotes odontoblastic gene expression in human dental pulp cells , whereas the inhibition of Sirt1 downregulates the expression of those genes. To investigate whether the overexpression of Sirt1 in mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) driven by Prx1 promoter could rescue the dentin formation defects in Bmi1-deficient ( Bmi1
