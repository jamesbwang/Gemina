  Ventilator management in ARDS focuses on ` setting ' parameters and not on ventilator disconnection. To determine if abrupt deflation after sustained inflation causes lung injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated ( 6 mL · kg-1) and randomized to Control ( n = 6 , PEEP 3 cmH2O; 100 min) or Intervention ( n = 6 , PEEP 3 to 11 cmH2O over 70 min; abrupt deflation to zero PEEP; ventilation for 30 mins). Lung function and injury was assessed , scanning electron microscopy performed , and microvascular leak timed by Evans Blue dye ( n = 4/group at 0 , 2 , 5 , 10 & 20 min post deflation). Hemodynamic assessment included systemic arterial pressure ( n = 6) , echocardiography ( n = 4) , and right ( n = 6) and left ventricular pressures ( n = 6). Abrupt deflation following sustained inflation ( vs. control) caused acute lung dysfunction ( compliance 0.48 ± 1.0 vs. 0.82 ± 0.2 mL · cmH20-1) and injury ( wet/dry ratio 6.1 ± 0.6 vs. 4.6 ± 0.4: P < 0.01). Vascular leak was absent before deflation and maximal 5-10 min thereafter; injury was predominantly endothelial. At deflation , left ventricular preload , systemic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and LVEDP increased precipitously in proportion to the degree of injury. Injury caused later right ventricular failure. Sodium nitroprusside prevented the increase in systemic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and LVEDP associated with deflation , and prevented injury. Injury did not occur with gradual deflation. Abrupt deflation after sustained inflation can cause acute lung injury. It appears to be mediated by acute LV decompensation ( increased LV preload and afterload) that elevates pulmonary microvascular pressure; this injures the endothelium and causes edema<symptom> , which is potentiated by the surge in pulmonary perfusion.
