  Deviation in gait performance from normative data of healthy cohorts is used to quantify gait ability. However , normative data is influenced by anthropometry and such differences among subjects impede accurate assessment. De-correlation of anthropometry from gait parameters and mobility measures is therefore desirable. 87 ( 42 male) healthy subjects varying form 21 to 84 years of age were assessed on gait parameters ( cadence , ankle velocity , stride time , stride length) and mobility measures ( the 3-meter/7-meter Timed Up-and-Go , 10-meter Walk Test). Multiple linear regression models were derived for each gait parameter and mobility measure , with anthropometric measurements ( age , height , body mass , gender) and self-selected walking speed as independent variables. The resulting models were used to normalize the gait parameters and mobility measures. The normalization 's capability in de-correlating data and reducing data dispersion were evaluated. Gait parameters were predominantly influenced by height and walking speed , while mobility measures were affected by age and walking speed. Normalization de-correlated data from anthropometric measurements from | rs | < 0.74 to | rs | < 0.23 , and reduced data dispersion by up to 69 %. Normalization of gait parameters and mobility measures through linear regression models augment the capability to compare subjects with varying anthropometric measurements.
