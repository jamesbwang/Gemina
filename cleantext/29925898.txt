  Gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy ( GDEPT) mediated by mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC) was already approved for clinical study on a progressive disease refractory to standard therapy. In this work , we examined the effect of several GDEPT approaches on chemoresistant cells. First , we derived 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU)- resistant variant of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells HT-29 designated HT-29/ EGFP/FUR. Our data show that the upregulation of thymidylate synthase ( TS) and downregulation of thymidine phosphorylase ( TP) , orotate phosphoribosyl transferase ( OPRT) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD) contributed to the 5-FU resistance in cancer cells. Next , we combined the MSC expressing either yeast cytosine deaminase ( CD-MSC) or fusion yeast CD:: uracil phosphoribosyl transferase ( CD:: UPRT-MSC) and prodrug 5-fluorocytosine ( 5-FC) in a cell-mediated GDEPT approach. Bystander cytotoxic effect in the direct co-cultures of the tumor and therapeutic cells mixed in a 5:1 ratio resulted in 55 % and 70 % inhibition of proliferation , respectively. However , the acquired chemoresistance to 5-FU can be overcome by introducing the prodrug-converting transgene into the tumor cells. When the transgene CD:: UPRT was expressed in the chemoresistant cells ( CD:: UPRT-FUR) , substantial suicide effect and a 90 % decrease in viability was observed using non-toxic concentration of 62.5 Âµg/ml 5-FC. In summary , we demonstrate here that the transgene introduction circumvented 5-FU resistance in the tumor cells.
