  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is a rare and aggressive disease with poor treatment response , mainly affecting adolescents and young adults. Few molecular biomarkers are used in the management of this cancer type , and although TP53 is one of few recurrently mutated genes in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , the mutation prevalence and the corresponding clinical value of the TP53 network remains unsettled. We present a multi-level molecular study focused on aberrations in the TP53 network in relation to patient outcome in a series of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors from 100 patients and 38 neurofibromas , including TP53 sequencing , high-resolution copy number analyses of TP53 and MDM2 , and gene expression profiling. Point mutations in TP53 were accompanied by loss of heterozygosity , resulting in complete loss of protein function in 8.2 % of the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Another 5.5 % had MDM2 amplification. TP53 mutation and MDM2 amplification were mutually exclusive and patients with either type of aberration in their tumor had a worse prognosis , compared to those without ( hazard ratio for 5-year disease-specific survival 3.5 , 95 % confidence interval 1.78-6.98). Both aberrations had similar consequences on the gene expression level , as analyzed by a TP53-associated gene signature , a property also shared with the copy number aberrations and/or loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus , suggesting a common `` TP53-mutated phenotype '' in as many as 60 % of the tumors. This was a poor prognostic phenotype ( hazard ratio = 4.1 , confidence interval: 1.7-9.8) , thus revealing a TP53-non-aberrant patient subgroup with a favorable outcome. The frequency of the `` TP53-mutated phenotype '' warrants explorative studies of stratified treatment strategies in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.
