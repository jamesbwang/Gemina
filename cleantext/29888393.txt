  Cluster randomized trials evaluate the effect of a treatment on persons nested within clusters , where treatment is randomly assigned to clusters. Current equations for the optimal sample size at the cluster and person level assume that the outcome variances and/or the study costs are known and homogeneous between treatment arms. This paper presents efficient yet robust designs for cluster randomized trials with treatment-dependent costs and treatment-dependent unknown variances , and compares these with 2 practical designs. First , the maximin design ( MMD) is derived , which maximizes the minimum efficiency ( minimizes the maximum sampling variance) of the treatment effect estimator over a range of treatment-to-control variance ratios. The MMD is then compared with the optimal design for homogeneous variances and costs ( balanced design) , and with that for homogeneous variances and treatment-dependent costs ( cost-considered design). The results show that the balanced design is the MMD if the treatment-to control cost ratio is the same at both design levels ( cluster , person) and within the range for the treatment-to-control variance ratio. It still is highly efficient and better than the cost-considered design if the cost ratio is within the range for the squared variance ratio. Outside that range , the cost-considered design is better and highly efficient , but it is not the MMD. An example shows sample size calculation for the MMD , and the computer code ( SPSS and R) is provided as supplementary material. The MMD is recommended for trial planning if the study costs are treatment-dependent and homogeneity of variances can not be assumed.
