  Vascular anomalies encompass a wide variety of clinical conditions involving the vasculature. Over the past several decades , the terminology has changed as our understanding of these conditions has improved. A well-accepted classification scheme has evolved with constant additions , updates , and revisions. Imaging techniques have also advanced with greater resolution and a better understanding of the correlation between imaging , clinical behavior , and natural history. Meanwhile , the treatment of these conditions has also changed , with greater focus on minimally invasive techniques as opposed to radical surgery. Despite these changes , surgical intervention remains a high-value option for select patients. With greater understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases , medical treatment has improved especially in severe cases where options remain limited. A multidisciplinary approach to comprehensive patient care usually yields the best outcome and is strongly encouraged.
