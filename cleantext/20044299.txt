  Diverse insects are associated with ancient bacterial symbionts , whose genomes have often suffered drastic reduction and degeneration. In extreme cases , such symbiont genomes seem almost unable to sustain the basic cellular functioning , which comprises an open question in the evolution of symbiosis. Here , we report an insect group wherein an ancient symbiont lineage suffering massive genome erosion has experienced recurrent extinction and replacement by host-associated pathogenic microbes. Cicadas are associated with the ancient bacterial co-obligate symbionts
