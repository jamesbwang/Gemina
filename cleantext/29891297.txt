  In this study , chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate was isolated and purified from the skin of corb ( Sciaena umbra) ( CSG) with a yield of 6.2 %. Chemical and structural analysis showed that CSG consisted of high sulfate content 28.74 % and an average molecular weight of 15.46 KDa. The separation of CSG by agarose-gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of DS and CS. Structural analysis of the purified CS/DS by means of SAX-HPLC after treatment with specific chondroitinases showed that this polymer was composed of nonsulfated disaccharide , monosulfated disaccharides and disulfated disaccharides in various percentages. The results also suggest that the percentage of CS and DS recovred in CSG were 24 % and 76 % , respectively. Anticoagulant activity in vitro was measured in plasma using classical anticoagulation tests: activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT) , thrombin time ( TT) and prothrombine time ( PT) tests. The findings thus indicated that the purified CS/DS exhibits a remarkably high anticoagulant effect.
