  In this study the aim was to collect data to assess the mental health of carers for patients with diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( IPD) according to disease stage and to examine precautions to reduce the patient and disease load on carers. The study included 144 patients with staging according to modified Hoehn and Yahr criteria and 144 patient relatives who provided care support for patients every day , for some or all of the day , and who were over the age of 18 years and accepted participation in the research. Our prospective and cross-sectional study performed detailed neurological examination of patients , and after completing the ` Personal Information Form ' with the interviewer every patient , with idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( IPD) according to ` UK Brain Bank ' diagnostic criteria , had the ` Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS) ' and ` Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale ( HYS) ' applied. Carers first completed the ` Personal Information Form ' and then had the ` Short Symptom Inventory ( SSI) ' applied. As the stage of disease increased , the points for all sub-scales of the Short Symptom Inventory increased. With the parallel increase in disease scores and UPDRS stage scores , the points obtained by carers on the SSI sub-scales increased. This data shows that with progressing disease stage , the load on the carer increases and mental health begins to be disrupted.
