  The dynamic process involving the selection and maturation of follicles is regulated and controlled by a highly synchronized and exquisitely timed cascade of gene expression. Studies have shown that long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA) is essential for the normal maintenance of animal reproductive function and has an important regulatory function in ovarian development and hormone secretion. In this study , a total of 2076 lncRNAs ( 1362 known lncRNAs and 714 new lncRNAs) and 25,491 mRNAs were identified in libraries constructed from Duroc ovaries on days 0 , 2 and 4 of follicle development. lncRNAs were shorter , had fewer exons , exhibited a shorter ORF<pathogen> ( Open Reading Frame) length and lower expression levels , and were less conserved than mRNAs. Furthermore , 1694 transcripts ( 140 lncRNAs and 1554 mRNAs) were found to be differentially expressed in pairwise comparisons. A total of 6945 co-localized mRNAs were detected in cis in 2076 lncRNAs. The most enriched GO ( Gene Ontology) terms were related to developmental processes. KEGG ( Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed lncRNAs targeted mRNAs , and the differentially expressed mRNAs were related to the TGF- & beta; signaling pathway , the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway , the Retinol metabolic pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway. This study deepened our understanding of the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of follicular development in pigs.
