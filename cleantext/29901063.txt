  Nanoparticles may act as compatibilizing agents for blending of immiscible polymers , leading to changes in blend morphology through a variety of mechanisms including interfacial adsorption , aggregation , and nucleation of polymer crystals. Herein , we report an approach to define highly structured donor/acceptor networks based on poly ( 3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT) and CdSe quantum dots ( QDs) by demixing from an insulating polystyrene ( PS) matrix. The incorporation of QDs led to laterally phase-separated co-continuous structures with sub-micrometer dimensions , and promoted crystallization of P3HT , yielding highly interconnected P3HT/QD hybrid nanowires embedded in the polymer matrix. These nanohybrid materials formed by controlling phase separation , interfacial activity , and crystallization within ternary donor/acceptor/insulator blends , offer attractive morphologies for potential use in optoelectronics.
