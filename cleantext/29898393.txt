  Homeostatic synaptic downscaling reduces neuronal excitability by modulating the number of postsynaptic receptors. Histone modifications and the subsequent chromatin remodeling play critical roles in activity-dependent gene expression. Histone modification codes are recognized by chromatin readers that affect gene expression by altering chromatin structure. We show that L3mbtl1 ( lethal 3 malignant brain tumor-like 1) , a polycomb chromatin reader , is downregulated by neuronal activity and is essential for synaptic response and downscaling. Genome-scale mapping of L3mbtl1 occupancies identified Ctnnb1 as a key gene downstream of L3mbtl1. Importantly , the occupancy of L3mbtl1 on the Ctnnb1 gene was regulated by neuronal activity. L3mbtl1 knockout neurons exhibited reduced Ctnnb1 expression. Partial knockdown of Ctnnb1 in wild-type neurons reduced excitatory synaptic transmission and abolished homeostatic downscaling , and transfecting Ctnnb1 in L3mbtl1 knockout neurons enhanced synaptic transmission and restored homeostatic downscaling. These results highlight a role for L3mbtl1 in regulating homeostasis of synaptic efficacy.
