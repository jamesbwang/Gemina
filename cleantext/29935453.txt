  In this study , six different herbal-extraction residues were evaluated for succinic acid production in terms of chemical composition before and after dilute acid pretreatment ( DAP) and sugar release performance. Chemical composition showed that pretreated residues of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch ( GUR) and Morus alba L. ( MAR) had the highest cellulose content , 50 % and 52 % , respectively. Higher concentrations of free sugars ( 71.6 g/L total sugar) and higher hydrolysis yield ( 92 %) were both obtained under 40 FPU/g DM at 10 % solid loading for GUR. Using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , GUR was found to show a less compact structure due to process of extraction. Specifically , the fibers in pretreated GUR were coarse and disordered compared with that of GUR indicated by SEM. Finally , 65 g/L succinic acid was produced with a higher yield of 0.89 g/g total sugar or 0.49 g/g GUR. Our results illustrate the potential of GUR for succinic acid production.
