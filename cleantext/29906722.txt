  Although soil contamination must be remediated by the polluters under current legal frameworks in numerous countries , the allocation of responsibilities for soil clean-up is still challenging in the case of multiple potentially responsible parties ( PRPs). This study evaluated the individual contributions of two PRPs ( Owners A & B) to heavy metal contamination in the soil environment near an abandoned smelter and compared the results with those from the conventional Gore Factor ( GF) method. The soil in the study area was widely contaminated by various heavy metals. In particular , the arsenic concentration exceeded the local regulatory level of 25 mg kg
