  A systematic approach is given for engineering dissipative environments that steer quantum wave packets along desired trajectories. The methodology is demonstrated with several illustrative examples: environment-assisted tunneling , trapping , effective mass assignment , and pseudorelativistic behavior. Nonconservative stochastic forces do not inevitably lead to decoherence-we show that purity can be well preserved. These findings highlight the flexibility offered by nonequilibrium open quantum dynamics.
