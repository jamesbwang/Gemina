  Essential tremor<symptom> ( ET) is a progressive and highly prevalent neurologic disease. Along with the tremors<symptom> , mild to moderate gait ataxia<symptom> and other signs of cerebellar dysfunction may occur ( i.e. , subtle saccadic eye movement<symptom> abnormalities and abnormalities of motor timing) as well as cognitive features , some of which may be due to cerebellar dysfunction. Numerous neuroimaging studies indicate the presence of functional , metabolic , and structural abnormalities in the cerebellum of a patient with ET. In tandem with these clinical and imaging studies , which were gathering increasing support for the notion that the cerebellum and/or cerebellar systems seemed to be at the root of ET , a growing postmortem literature is for the first time beginning to identify microscopic abnormalities in the ET brain , most of which are centered on the Purkinje cells and connected neuronal populations , and are likely to be degenerative. In terms of treatment , most of these pharmacotherapeutic agents serve to enhance GABAergic neurotransmission , further bolstering the notion that ET may very well be a disorder with a primary Purkinje cell dysfunction resulting in reduced cerebellar cortical inhibition. Similarly , the interruption of presumably abnormal cerebellar outflow pathways to the thalamus is the mechanism of deep-brain stimulation surgery , which is highly effective in treating ET.
