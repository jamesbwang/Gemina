  Familial chylomicronemia syndrome<disease> ( FCS) is a rare lipid disorder posing significant clinical burdens on patients. Due to its rarity , variety of presentations , and lack of universal diagnostic criteria , patients see an average of five physicians before diagnosis. We screened adults for a triglyceride level ≥ 1000 mg/dL from September 2015 to September 2016 and a history of pancreatitis<disease> and performed a thorough chart review on those who met the criteria. An adjudication panel used a definition that also called for supportive information including history of hypertriglyceridemia or family history of pancreatitis/hypertriglyceridemia. Among 297,891 adults with laboratory values available , 334 ( 0.11 %) had triglyceride levels ≥ 1000 mg/dL , and 30 ( 9 %) of those had pancreatitis<disease> Most of these 30 patients were male ( 73 %) , had diabetes ( 90 %) , were taking a fibrate ( 93 %) , and were taking a statin ( 80 %). The average body mass index was 32.5 ± 4.5 kg/m
