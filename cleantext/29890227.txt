  Over the past decades , conventional antibodies have been dissected through different strategies into smaller antigen-binding fragments. Therapeutic solutions built on such fragments can offer several advantages , including the capacity to access challenging epitopes , reduced immunogenicity , lower production costs , and higher stability. Although the development of antibody fragments for cancer therapy has received more attention than any other potential therapeutic application , the development of pharmacological tools based on these molecules for the treatment of autoimmune diseases ( AIDs) has been growing at a fast pace. Here , I provide an in-depth characterization of the various formats for the treatment of autoimmune diseases in development across the industry , including antigen-binding fragments ( Fab) , single-chain variable fragments ( scFv) , and single variable-domain fragments , as well as multimeric antibody fragments and antibody-drug conjugates.
