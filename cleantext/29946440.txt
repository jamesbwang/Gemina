  The process of assembling a species ' reference genome may be performed in a number of iterations , with subsequent genome assemblies differing in the coordinates of mapped elements. The conversion of genome coordinates between different assemblies is required for many integrative and comparative studies. While currently a number of bioinformatics tools are available to accomplish this task , most of them are tailored towards the conversion of single genome coordinates. When converting the boundary positions of segments spanning larger genome regions , segments may be mapped into smaller sub-segments if the original segment 's continuity is disrupted in the target assembly. Such a conversion may lead to a relevant degree of data loss in some circumstances such as copy number variation ( CNV) analysis , where the quantitative representation of a genomic region takes precedence over base-specific accuracy.
