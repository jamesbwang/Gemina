  A venous leg ulcer<disease> ( VLU) is defined as the loss of skin below the knee on the leg or foot in the presence of venous disease , which takes more than two weeks to heal. The prevalence of VLUs is increasing , especially in older people , which will increase the demand for nursing care. Development of a lower leg ulcer<disease> should trigger immediate assessment of risk factors for chronic venous disease followed by action to identify the cause and initiate treatment , which should prevent progression to more complex and chronic problems. Justification for choice of appropriate wound<disease> management and application of compression therapy should be based on the assessment and diagnosis. Management of patients with VLUs can be cyclical and lifelong , which highlights the importance of helping patients to understand the rationale for management strategies so that cooperation in self-care is achieved.
