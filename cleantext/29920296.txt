  For the interpretation of middle cerebral artery flow velocity ( MCAFV) measurements by transcranial Doppler clinicians should take normal aging into account. MCAFV measurements can be corrected for age by a transformation to Z-scores , expressing in standard deviations the distance of a measurement to the regression line as function of age. Z-scores for different parameters can be combined into a single plot in order to facilitate clinical interpretation. In a retrospective analysis 41 subjects were identified with normal autonomic responses , normal CO2-reactivity and satisfactory transcranial Doppler data. Age related changes were determined for: maximal change in flow velocity ( FV) during stroke onset ( Acc) , maximal FV during the first ( Sys1) and second phase ( Sys2) of systole and mean diastolic FV 560 ms after stroke onset ( Dias@560). Patients were supine and breathing normally. Sys1 , Sys2 and Dias@560 decreased significantly with age: -0.58 cm/s/yr , -0.36 cm/s/yr. and -0.38 cm/s/yr. , respectively. Sys1 decreased more rapidly than Sys2 and Dias@560 so that in the young the MCAFV signal is more Sys1 dominant , whereas in the elderly it becomes more Sys2 prevalent. The effect of CO2-reactivity was assessed by transformation to Z-scores and combining different parameters within a single radar plot. In contrast to standard MCAFV measurements the calculation of Z-scores takes aging into account and standardizes the signal variation. Graphically combining Z-scores for different MCAFV parameters makes the signal more accessible for rapid clinical interpretation.
