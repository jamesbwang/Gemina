  Eosinophilia , both peripheral and in cutaneous tissue , is not a typical finding in mycosis<disease> fungoides; in fact , when faced with a lymphoeosinophilic infiltrate , mycosis<disease> fungoides is often not part of initial differential considerations. However , eosinophilia has been described in certain subtypes of mycosis<disease> fungoides , namely , in folliculotropic mycosis<disease> fungoides. We describe three challenging cases of folliculotropic mycosis<disease> fungoides presenting with varied clinical morphologies and a dense lymphoeosinophilic infiltrate and/or severe hypereosinophilia that obscured the final diagnosis for years. Only after treatment of the eosinophilia were the underlying atypical lymphocytes more apparent on histology and a correct diagnosis made. Thus , when characteristic features of mycosis<disease> fungoides are subtle , eosinophils can act as a red herring in terms of clinico-pathologic correlation and may prevent early and accurate diagnosis of mycosis<disease> fungoides. We suggest that further studies are needed to evaluate whether treatments to reduce eosinophilia , once other causes have been excluded , may help clear the confounding reactive inflammatory infiltrate and facilitate the diagnosis of mycosis<disease> fungoides.
