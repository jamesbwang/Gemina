  This study presents experimental results and an analysis approach for polarized light effects associated with thermomechanical stress during cooling of glass promoting solutions , with applications to cryopreservation and tissue banking in a process known as vitrification. Polarized light means have been previously integrated into the cryomacroscope-a visualization device to detect physical effects associated with cryopreservation success , such as crystallization , fracture formation , and contamination. The experimental study concerns vitrification in a cuvette , which is a rectangular container. Polarized light modeling in the cuvette is based on subdividing the tridimensional ( 3D) domain into a series of planar ( 2D) problems , for which a mathematical solution is available in the literature. The current analysis is based on tracking the accumulated changes in light polarization and magnitude , as it passes through the sequence of planar problems. Results of this study show qualitative agreement in light intensity history and distribution between experimental data and simulated results. The simulated results help explaining differences between 2D and 3D effects in photoelasticity , most notably , the counterintuitive observation that high stress areas may correlate with low light intensity regions based on the particular experimental conditions. Finally , it is suggested that polarized-light analysis must always be accompanied by thermomechanical stress modeling in order to explain 3D effects.
