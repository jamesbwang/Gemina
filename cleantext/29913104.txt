  The aim was to evaluate the effects of irradiation of Culex<pathogen> pipiens irradiated as pupae on the larval and pupal mortality percentages , the larval and pupal duration , adult emergence percentages and ovarian development in comparison with the un-irradiated group. The mosquito , C. pipiens Linnaeus ( L) was irradiated as pupae with three gamma doses 40 , 60 and 80 Gy. Different biological aspects include the ovarian development of irradiated females tested. Gamma doses used significantly increased the larval and pupal mortality percentages , the larval and pupal duration and significantly decreased the adult emergence percentages. Moreover , fecundity and egg hatchability percentages were severely decreased with increasing gamma doses. While the sterility % was positively correlated with the doses used. Gamma doses caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of developed eggs , reduction in the number of developed oocytes , signs of degenerative processes in oocytes , yolk mass and egg size decrease. Results obtained indicated that gamma radiation of C. pipiens induced remarkable effects on the biological , developmental and reproductive activity.
