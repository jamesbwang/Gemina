  The northern regions are experiencing considerable changes in winter climate leading to more frequent warm periods , rain-on-snow events and reduced snow pack diminishing the insulation properties of snow cover and increasing soil frost and freeze-thaw cycles. In this study , we investigated how the lack of snow cover , formation of ice encasement and snow compaction affect the size , structure and activities of soil bacterial and fungal communities. Contrary to our hypotheses , snow manipulation treatments over one winter had limited influence on microbial community structure , bacterial or fungal copy numbers or enzyme activities. However , microbial community structure and activities shifted seasonally among soils sampled before snow melt , in early and late growing season and seemed driven by substrate availability. Bacterial and fungal communities were dominated by stress-resistant taxa such as the orders Acidobacteriales , Chaetothyriales and Helotiales that are likely adapted to adverse winter conditions. This study indicated that microbial communities in acidic northern boreal forest<disease> soil may be insensitive to direct effects of changing snow cover. However , in long term , the detrimental effects of increased ice and frost to plant roots may alter plant derived carbon and nutrient pools to the soil likely leading to stronger microbial responses.
