  Nitrogen ( N) is a key macronutrient required for plant growth and development. In this study , watermelon plants were grown under hydroponic conditions at 0.2 mM N , 4.5 mM N , and 9 mM N for 14 days. Dry weight and photosynthetic assimilation at low N ( 0.2 mM) was reduced by 29 and 74 % compared with high N ( 9 mM). The photochemical activity ( Fv/Fm) was also reduced from 0.78 at high N to 0.71 at low N. The N concentration in the leaf , stem , and root of watermelon under low N conditions was reduced by 68 , 104 , and 108 % , respectively compared with 9 mM N treatment after 14 days of N treatment. In the leaf tissues of watermelon grown under low N conditions , 9598 genes were differentially expressed , out of which 4533 genes ( 47.22 %) were up-regulated whereas , 5065 genes ( 52.78 %) were down-regulated compared with high N. Similarly in the root tissues , 3956 genes were differentially expressed , out of which 1605 genes were up-regulated ( 40.57 %) and 2351 genes were down-regulated ( 59.43 %) , compared with high N. Our results suggest that leaf tissues are more sensitive to N deficiency compared with root tissues. The gene ontology ( GO) analysis showed that the availability of N significantly affected 19 biological processes , 8 cell component metabolic pathways , and 3 molecular functions in the leaves; and 13 biological processes , 12 molecular functions , and 5 cell component metabolic pathways in the roots of watermelon. The low affinity nitrate transporters , high affinity nitrate transporters , ammonium transporters , genes related with nitrogen assimilation , and chlorophyll and photosynthesis were expressed differentially in response to low N. Three nitrate transporters ( Cla010066 , Cla009721 , Cla012765) substantially responded to low nitrate supply in the root and leaf tissues. Additionally , a large number of transcription factors ( 1365) were involved in adaptation to low N availability. The major transcription factor families identified in this study includes MYB , AP2-EREBP , bHLH , C2H2 and NAC. Candidate genes identified in this study for nitrate uptake and transport can be targeted and utilized for further studies in watermelon breeding and improvement programs to improve N uptake and utilization efficiency.
