  In the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus , maintaining a euglycemic state represents one of the key challenges. Improper dosing and administration of glucose-lowering drugs is associated with an increased risk of recurrent hypoglycemia episodes. In addition , the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in diabetic patients , particularly myocardial infarctions and strokes , is well established. Current research indicates a potential link between the baseline risk of cardio/cerebrovascular events in diabetic patients and exposure to hypoglycemia. In this review of the literature , we aim to determine if a relationship exists between recurrent hypoglycemia and adverse neurovascular events.
