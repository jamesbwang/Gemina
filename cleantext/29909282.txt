  Several studies demonstrated that oral health impairment , such as tooth loss or a decrease in salivary flow might lead elderly people to reduce their meat intake. The present study assessed the impact of culinary processes liable to improve meat texture and smooth down meat oral processing , in order to fulfil the oral capacities of elderly people. Four culinary processes were selected: cooking bag , blade tenderizer , marinade and low-temperature cooking. A panel of 40 elderly participants with good and poor dental status were asked to assess 5 chicken breast samples , 5 roast beef samples and 4 beefsteak samples prepared according to different process conditions by using an `` oral comfort '' questionnaire. Results highlighted the fact that oral impairment may alter food bolus formation as well as texture perception while eating meat in elderly people. Furthermore , they revealed that easy-to-do culinary processes may improve meat tenderness<symptom> and juiciness as well as smooth down food bolus formation , in particular for the roast beef.
