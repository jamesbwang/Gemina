  Nurses are expected to support people to self-manage. Student nurses therefore need to master competencies that include the assessment of peoples ' needs and preferences , and shared decision-making , whilst respecting and enhancing peoples ' autonomy. Adapting nurse education programmes to meet this goal requires insight into the practice of teaching self-management support. In order to reveal this practice , one can distinguish between the intended , the taught , and the received curriculum. This study aimed to explore how Dutch Bachelor of Nursing students are educated to support peoples ' self-management in clinical practice. Mixed methods. Focus group meetings with 30 lecturers , and qualitative semi-structured interviews with four coordinators and four ( associate) professors of four Dutch schools for Bachelor of Nursing. Syllabuses were screened for learning objectives related to self-management. A survey measuring self-efficacy and behaviour regarding self-management support was distributed among 444 final-year students of these schools , resulting in 238 valid responses ( response rate 53.6 %). Much attention is paid in the curriculum to assessment of people 's preferences and healthcare education but less attention is given to teaching the arrangement of follow-up care. The study further reveals that students have problems transferring theory into practice , and that they experience conflicting values between their nurse education and internships. Currently , students are taught to provide people with self-management support by learning about theoretical models , developing communication skills , and reflecting on their internships. This approach seems inadequate to prepare students for this task in daily practice. A shared view on self-management support based on authentic situations , having role models at university and on internships and empowering students may enable them to better support people to self-manage.
