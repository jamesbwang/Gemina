  Oviparity is an ancestral reproductive strategy in which females lay fertilized eggs to the environment. During development , the offspring rely solely on the resources provided by the yolk sac to favor growth and maturation. This type of nutrition is also known as `` lecithotrophy. '' The clear-nosed skate ( Raja eglanteria) is an Atlantic coast species that uses this reproductive pattern. Skates usually produce two eggs , which are fertilized in the oviduct by stored sperm and subsequently released. The egg , also referred to as Mermaid 's purse , has a horn at each of its four corners with a respiratory canal at the base. By midgestation , tail beating of the embryo brings water inside. The yolk sac diminishes in size as the developing embryo grows. At 12 weeks of development , the skate is ready to hatch and will be fully independent.
