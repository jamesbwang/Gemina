  The aim of this study is to quantify the 146S antigen in foot-and-mouth disease<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( FMDV) inactivated vaccine by size-exclusion chromatography ( SEC). The analysis was performed on a TSKgel G4000SWXL column ( 7.8 mm × 30 cm) , with a pH 7.2 buffer salt system as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 0.6 mL/min , the injection volume was 100 μL and the detection wavelength was 259 nm. The calibration curve was established by using purified inactivated FMDV ( serotype O) 146S antigen; 3 batches of vaccine formulated by inactivated antigen solution were tested to verify the accuracy , reproducibility , specificity and tolerability of the method. At last 16 batches of vaccine were determined by the SEC method. Results showed a good linearity between peak area and concentration of 146S antigen in the range between 0.56 and 67.42 μg/mL ( R2 = 0.996 , n = 10) , and the average recovery rate of 146S antigen in the 3 batches of vaccine formulated in lab were 93.6 % ( RSD = 2.7 % , n = 3) , 102.3 % ( RSD = 2.6 % , n = 3) , and 95.5 % ( RSD = 5.1 % , n = 3). The method was proved accurate and reliable with good reproducibility ( RSD = 0.5 % , n = 6) , and applied to determine 16 batches of the commercial FMDV vaccine. According to the above results , the SEC method is high effective for 146S antigen quantify in the inactivated FMDV vaccine and would provide strong support for the vaccine quality control.
