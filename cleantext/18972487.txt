  Herein , we report a methodology for the synthesis of polyolefin containing block-copolymers using a catalytic postpolymerization modification strategy. The most common polyolefin grades are converted into macroinitiators using a cross-metathesis reaction. These functionalized polyolefins are then used to initiate living: coordinative ring opening polymerization of lactide , anionic ring opening polymerization of epoxide , and radical polymerization of styrene to yield the corresponding block copolymers. The high activity of the catalysts employed in the different steps offers improved practicality for scalable synthesis.
