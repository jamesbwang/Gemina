  Cyberbullying has regularly been shown to be associated with suicide ideation/behavior. The present study investigated whether positive mental health , i.e. , high levels of emotional , cognitive and psychological well-being , buffers the association between cyberbullying and suicide ideation/behavior. A total of 225 students completed measures of cyberbullying , suicide ideation/behavior , and positive mental health. Positive mental health fully mediated the association between cyberbullying and suicide ideation/behavior. Positive mental health seems to confer resilience and should be taken into account in clinical and preventive programs for student populations.
