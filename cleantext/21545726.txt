  To report the causes of permanent severe visual impairment and blindness<symptom> among Jordanian blind people. This study was conducted on 1422 legally blind or worse vision people of all ages who attended the ophthalmic division of a medical committee for evaluation of disabled persons from July 2013 through November 2014. They were divided into two age groups: adult group ( 998 cases) and childhood group ( < 16 years , 424 cases). Patients presented reports from their ophthalmologists detailing their eye examination including best-corrected visual acuity , slit-lamp examinations , and if applicable , intraocular pressure , dilated ophthalmoscopy , and visual field and the primary cause of visual impairment. Blind defined as best-corrected visual acuity < 6/60 ( 20/200) and/or visual field of 20 Â° or less. Retinitis pigmentosa was the most common cause of blindness<symptom> among adult group ( 29.7 %) followed by diabetic retinopathy ( 19.9 %) and glaucoma ( 15.8 %). Congenital whole-globe malformations were the most common cause of blindness<symptom> among childhood cases ( 16.7 %) followed by retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP) ( 15.8 %) and retinal dystrophies ( 13.9 %). Overall , blindness<symptom> related to genetic diseases , illnesses , and trauma was present at 56.5 % ( 803) , 41.7 % ( 593) , and 1.8 % ( 26) of cases , respectively. Genetic diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa , diabetic retinopathy , and glaucoma were the dominant causes of blindness<symptom> among adults , while whole-globe malformation , ROP , and retinal dystrophies were the dominant causes of childhood blindness<symptom>. These major causes of blindness<symptom> should be considered in future public health and nongovernmental organizations strategies for blindness<symptom> prevention in Jordan.
