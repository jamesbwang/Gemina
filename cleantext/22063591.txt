  The aim of this study was to compare the vacuum and air cooling of cooked chicken breast samples arranged in stacks with one , two and three layers ( 1 kg per layer). The cooling rate obtained with vacuum cooling was approximately three times faster than that of air cooling. Moreover , a more homogeneous cooling was obtained with vacuum cooling , with similar temperature reductions for samples at different positions of the stack. On the other hand , vacuum cooling led to mass losses of 11-12 % , while air cooling led to losses of 7-8 %. The counts of mesophiles and psychrophiles of the vacuum-cooled samples were lower than those observed for air-cooled samples after ten days of product storage. Thus , the results presented in this work illustrate the potential benefits and disadvantages of the vacuum cooling technique as compared to the air cooling , especially for the processing of small meat cuts.
