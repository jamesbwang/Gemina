  An effective approach is presented to improve intermodal third-harmonic generation in microfibers. It is demonstrated that structure-independent incident pump power could be utilized , via its effect on nonlinear phase modulations , to compensate for the phase mismatch caused by diameter deviation. The output harmonic of a fabricated microfiber can be optimized adaptively; thus , efficient third-harmonic generation with efficiency reaching several percent could realistically be achieved.
