  The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis<disease> score ( NFS) is comprised of unique metabolic risk indicators that may accurately predict residual cardiovascular ( CV) risk in patients with established coronary disease and metabolic dysfunction. We applied the NFS prospectively to 14,819 post-ACS patients randomized to ezetimibe/simvastatin ( E/S) or placebo/simvastatin ( P/S) , in the IMPROVE-IT trial , using validated NFS cutoffs. The primary endpoint included CV death , myocardial infarction , unstable angina , revascularization or stroke. Outcomes were compared between NFS categories and treatment arms using frequency of events , KM rates and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. The ability of the NFS to predict recurrent CV events was independently validated in 5395 placebo-treated patients enrolled in the SOLID-TIMI 52 trial. Among 14,819 patients enrolled in IMPROVE-IT , 14.2 % ( N = 2106) were high-risk ( NFS > 0.67). The high-risk group had a 30 % increased risk of recurrent major CV events , compared to the low-risk NFS group ( HR 1.30 ( 1.19-1.43); p < 0.001). Among high-risk patients , ezetimibe/simvastatin conferred a 3.7 % absolute reduction in risk of recurrent CV events , compared to placebo/simvastatin ( HR 0.85 ( 0.74-0.98)) , translating to a number-needed-to-treat of 27. Similar benefit was not found in the low-risk group ( HR ezetimibe/simvastatin vs. placebo/simvastatin , 1.01 ( 0.91-1.12); p-interaction = 0.053). The relationship between NFS category and recurrent CV events was independently validated in patients enrolled in SOLID-TIMI 52 ( HR for NFS > 0.67 vs. NFS < -1.455 = 1.55 ( 1.32-1.81); p < 0.001). Stratification of cardiovascular risk by NFS identifies an independent population of patients who are at highest risk of recurrent events , and most likely to benefit from dual lipid-lowering therapy.
