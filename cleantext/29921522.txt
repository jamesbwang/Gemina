  Although the beam theory is widely used for calculating material parameters in three-point bending test , it can not accurately describe the biomechanical properties of specimens after the yield. Hence , we propose a finite element ( FE) based optimization method to obtain accurate bone material parameters from three-point bending test. We tested 80 machined bovine cortical bone specimens at both longitudinal and transverse directions using three-point bending. We then adopted the beam theory and the FE-based optimization method combined with specimen-specific FE models to derive the material parameters of cortical bone. We compared data obtained using these two methods and further evaluated two groups of parameters with three-point bending simulations. Our data indicated that the FE models with material properties from the FE-based optimization method showed best agreements with experimental data for the entire force-displacement responses , including the post-yield region. Using the beam theory , the yield stresses derived from 0.0058 % strain offset for the longitudinal specimen and 0.0052 % strain offset for the transverse specimen are closer to those derived from the FE-based optimization method , compared to yield stresses calculated without strain offset. In brief , we conclude that the optimization FE method is more appropriate than the traditional beam theory in identifying the material parameters of cortical bone for improving prediction accuracy in three-point bending mode. Given that the beam theory remains as a popular method because of its efficiency , we further provided correction functions to adjust parameters calculated from the beam theory for accurate FE simulation.
