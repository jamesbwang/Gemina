  A water soluble M12L6 coordination cage ( TC-1) was synthesized by coordination self-assembly of a symmetrical tetrapyridyl donor ( L) with the 90 ° ditopic acceptor cis- ( tmeda) Pd ( NO3) 2 ( tmeda = N , N , N ' , N '- tetramethylethane-1,2-diamine). The newly synthesized M12L6 coordination assembly represents an uncommon example of a coordination cage having triangular orthobicupola-like geometry. It was characterized by multinuclear NMR , ESI-MS and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis ( SCXRD). Self-assembly of a tetratopic donor with a cis-blocked 90 ° ditopic acceptor generally yields either tri-/ tetra-/ hexagonal barrels or closed cubic cages. However , in the present case the donor and acceptor are arranged in an unusual fashion to generate an orthobicupola geometry in which two triangular cupola share a common irregular hexagonal face. The cage was used to perform intramolecular cycloaddition reactions of O-propargylated benzylidinebarbituric acid derivatives in nitromethane. Several penta-/ tetra-cyclouracil derivatives were synthesized through cage catalyzed ( 4 +2) cycloaddition reactions in a concerted manner with good to high conversion under mild reaction conditions , whereas in the absence of cage TC-1 similar reaction led to less conversion of the cyclized products in organic solvent. This approach is of particular importance compared to the literature reports for the synthesis of similar derivatives performed under high temperature reflux conditions with high catalyst loading.
