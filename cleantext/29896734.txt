  To report on prenatal diagnosis and follow up of two patients with paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 6 ( pUPD6). Fetal cells were subjected to in situ culturing and G-banded chromosomal analysis. DNA samples of the fetuses and their parents were also analyzed with single nucleotide polymorphism microarray ( SNP array). Both fetuses had a normal male karyotype. SNP array analysis showed both have carried pUPD6. pUPD6 can lead to transient neonatal diabetes mellitus type 1. Homozygous status of recessive mutations , disorder of gene imprinting , and its influence on placental function are the main factors to be considered during prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling for pUPD6.
