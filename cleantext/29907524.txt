  Currently it is not clear whether age is a factor affecting revisions in total hip replacement ( THR) and hip resurfacing ( HR). This study aimed to investigate which of THR or HR has a higher risk in terms of revision and complication within similar age groups. A systemic review was performed for published literature research databases and local data and compared the two procedures under the condition that both groups of patients were age matched. Meta-analysis techniques were used to analyse revision and complication rates. Twenty-seven literature studies were included along with local audit data. In total , 2520 HR procedures were compared with age-matched 2526 of THR procedures. It was found that revision risk of HR is significantly higher than THR ( risk ratio 1.65 , 95 % CI 1.28-2.31 , p < 0.0001) , highlighting that HR has a slightly higher chance of reoperation when compared to THR within the similar age group population. In terms of complications , HR was found to have an advantage over THR ( risk ratio 0.84 , 95 % CI 0.73-0.96 , p < 0.01). THR had a lower revision risk but a slightly higher complication risk than HR under the condition that the two surgical procedures were applied to similar age groups of patients. In other words , age has not played an important role in revision and complication. Survivorship can not be measured as follow-up periods were different in the studies used.
