  We examined whether or not coherence between chest wall intercostal and oblique muscles changed as a function of lung volume excursion , alveolar pressure , and muscular demand. We also assessed the effects of acute expiratory threshold loading ( ETL) on chest wall muscular control. A total of 15 healthy adults ( 7 males; average age = 28 years) completed maximum performance and ETL tasks. Chest wall surface electromyographic and kinematic recordings were made. Participants also performed a session of acute ETL. We showed that corticomuscular control of the chest wall varied as a function of lung volume excursion and muscular effort. Acute ETL had some effect on respiratory kinematics but not coherence.
