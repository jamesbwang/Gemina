  We present a novel method based on optical frequency-modulated continuous-wave interferometry that can realize simultaneous measurement of gas absorption spectra and optical path lengths ( OPLs) in the widely used multipass cells ( MPCs). This method involves a Fourier transform ( FT) and an inverse FT , by which the gas absorption spectrum and the OPL are retrieved in frequency and time domains , respectively. Various OPLs are achieved by retrieving gas absorption spectra associated with different reflection positions in the MPC. As a demonstration , absorption spectra of acetylene around 1520 nm are measured using a commercial White type MPC , achieving a noise equivalent absorbance of 0.01 and a spatial resolution of 290 Î¼m over 22.5 m OPL. Our proposed method shows advantages for MPC-based gas sensing applications in the significant relaxation of OPL calibration demands and flexible extension of measurement dynamic range.
