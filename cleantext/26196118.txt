  Immunoglobulin G4-related lung disease ( IgG4-RLD) is a disease in which abundant activated IgG4-positive plasma cells and lymphocytes infiltrate lung tissues with high 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. Although various forms of radiologic features of IgG4-RLD have been reported , cavitating mass is a rare imaging feature and should be differentiated from cancer. Therefore , in this article , we report two cases both with unprovoked cough<symptom> , bloody<symptom> sputum<symptom> and presenting quite similar cavitating lesions<symptom> with high 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography/ computed tomography , one of which diagnosed as IgG4-RLD and the other as lung cancer based on biopsy eventually. The awareness of the imaging features of IgG4-RLD and lung cancer described in the present study may help physicians to distinguish one from the other. IgG4-RLD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cavitary lung
