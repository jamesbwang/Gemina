  The prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) is increasing worldwide , yet there are no effective treatments. A decade has passed since the initial lipidomics analyses of liver tissues from patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We have learned that liver cells from patients with NASH have an abnormal lipid composition and that the accumulation of lipids leads to organelle dysfunction , cell injury and death , and chronic inflammation<symptom> , called lipotoxicity. We review the lipid species and metabolic pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH and potential therapeutic targets , including enzymes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis , bioactive sphingolipids and polyunsaturated-derived eicosanoids , and specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators. We discuss the concept that NASH is a disease that can resolve and the roles of lipid molecules in the resolution of inflammation<symptom> and regression of
