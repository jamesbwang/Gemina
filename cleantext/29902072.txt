Therefore , this paper focuses on the research of effective contribution of EOs to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens , systematically summarized the commonly used EOs and their main extraction methods and chemical components and , the antibacterial mechanism of EOs on food borne pathogens , systematically analysis the specific application case of EOs in food discussed. Hoping to provide some reference and help to the relevant researchers.
