  Patients younger than 55 years of age with papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC) have excellent survival. Diffuse sclerosing variant ( DSV) and tall cell variant ( TCV) of PTC are associated with aggressiveness; the survival of patients < 55 years of age with these variants is still unclear. We aim to investigate the clinicopathological features and survival of these variants in the age group < 55 years. All adult patients ( < 55 years old) with DSV , TCV and conventional PTC ( CPTC) came from the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results program ( 1988-2013). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to analyze the survival. Prognostic factors associated with survival were analyzed by Cox multivariate regression. There were 280 DSV , 615 TCV , and 56287 CPTC in the age group < 55 years. DSV and TCV were associated with multifocality , extrathyroidal extension , lymph node and distant metastasis ( all p < 0.05). The 10-year disease-specific survival ( DSS) of TCV was worse than CPTC ( 96.3 vs. 99.4 % , p < 0.01) , but there was no significant difference between DSV and CPTC ( 99.5 vs. 99.4 % , p > 0.05). Cox multivariate regression showed TCV was the independent predictor of DSS ( HR: 5.39 , p < 0.01). In the age group < 55 years , DSV and TCV are more likely to exhibit aggressive characteristics than CPTC. Patient < 55 years of age with DSV have excellent survival likewise , while patients < 55 years of age with TCV carry worse survival. Further investigation for the recurrence risk of patients < 55 years with these variants would contribute to optimal clinical management making.
