  This study evaluated the amount of apically extruded debris after chemo-mechanical preparation ( CMP) using positive and negative pressure irrigation systems ( Conventional irrigation ( CI) and EndoVac ( EV)) in association with different irrigants ( 6 % Sodium Hypochlorite ( NaOCl) , 2 % Chlorhexidine gel + saline solution ( CHXg + SS) , 2 % Chlorhexidine solution ( CHXs) or Saline solution ( SS)). Eighty mandibular premolars with single root canals were selected and randomly assigned into 8 groups ( n = 10) according to the irrigation system and the irrigant used during CMP: G1 ( EV + NaOCl) , G2 ( EV + CHXg + SS) , G3 ( EV + CHXs) , G4 ( EV + SS) , G5 ( CI + NaOCl) , G6 ( CI + CHXg + SS) , G7 ( CI + CHXs) and G8 ( CI + SS). Reciproc Â® R25 files ( 25/ .08) were used during the CMP and the extruded debris from each tooth was collected in pre-weighted Eppendorf tubes and dried. The average weight of debris was assessed using a microbalance , and the data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and the post hoc Tukey 's test ( a = 0.05). All groups were associated with debris extrusion. EV was the irrigation system with less extruded debris ( p < 0.05). No differences were observed regarding the irrigant when EV was used. When CI was used , CHXg + SS were associated with lower debris extrusion ( p < 0.05). It was concluded that no irrigation protocol succeeded in preventing debris extrusion. EV resulted in lower levels of debris extrusion than CI. The use of CHXg + SS resulted in lower debris extrusion.
