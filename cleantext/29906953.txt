  The present paper is devoted to studying the thermophoresis of a nonspherical convex particle suspended in a gas with nonuniform temperature distribution in the free-molecule regime. Based on the gas kinetic theory and the assumption of a rigid-body collision for the gas-particle interaction , analytical expressions for the thermophoretic forces are obtained for several typical nonspherical bodies , including cylinders , spheroids , needles , disks , and cuboids. The orientation dependences of the thermophoretic forces and thermophoretic velocities are evaluated based on these expressions. It is found that the influence of the pitching effect of the nonspheres can be significant. The expressions for the orientation-averaged thermophoretic forces are also obtained under the assumption of a uniform particle orientation distribution.
