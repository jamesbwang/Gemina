  Metaphyseal dysplasia with maxillary hypoplasia and brachydactyly ( MDMHB) is an autosomal-dominant skeletal dysplasia characterised by metaphyseal flaring of the long bones , enlargement of the medial halves of the clavicles , maxillary hypoplasia , brachydactyly , dental anomalies and mild osteoporosis. To date , only one large French Canadian family and a Finnish woman have been reported with the condition. In both , intragenic duplication encompassing exons 3-5 of the RUNX2 gene was identified. We describe a new , three-generation family with clinical features of MDMHB and an intragenic tandem duplication of RUNX2 exons 3-6. Dental problems were the primary presenting feature in all four affected individuals. We compare the features in our family to those previously reported in MDMHB , review the natural history of this condition and highlight the importance of considering an underlying skeletal dysplasia in patients presenting with significant dental problems and other suggestive features , including disproportionate short stature and/or digital anomalies.
