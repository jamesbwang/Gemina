  Working memory is the ability to hold information `` online '' over a time delay in order to perform a task. This kind of memory is encoded in the brain by persistent neural activity that outlasts the presentation of a stimulus. Patients with schizophrenia perform poorly in working memory tasks that require the brief memory of a target location in space. This deficit indicates that persistent neural activity related to spatial locations may be impaired in the disease. At the circuit level , many studies have shown that NMDA receptors and the dopamine system are involved in both schizophrenia pathology and working memory-related persistent activity. In this Hypothesis and Theory article , we examine the possible connection between NMDA receptors , the dopamine system , and schizophrenia-linked working memory deficits. In particular , we focus on the dopamine breakdown product homocysteine ( HCY) , which is consistently elevated in schizophrenia patients. Our previous studies have shown that HCY strongly reduces the desensitization of NMDA currents. Here , we show that HCY likely affects NMDA receptors in brain regions that support working memory; this is because these areas favor dopamine breakdown over transport to clear dopamine from synapses. Finally , within the context of two NMDA-based computational models of working memory , we suggest a mechanism by which HCY could give rise to the working memory deficits observed in schizophrenia patients.
