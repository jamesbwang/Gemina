  BACKGROUND Periprocedural myocardial injury ( PMI) is known to be a predictor of postprocedural cardiovascular morbidity and mortality following a percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). However , the correlation between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and periprocedural myocardial injury in patients following elective PCI in southern China remains unclear. Therefore , we aimed to investigate the association of preoperative low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) levels with PMI in patients following elective PCI. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included 1942 consecutive patients who received elective PCI. Cardiac troponin I ( cTnI) was used to assess perioperative myocardial injury. The peak cTnI was measured within 24 h after PCI , and the correlation between the cTnI value and the preoperative LDL level was studied. RESULTS The data suggest that the PCI patients with preprocedural LDL-C < 100 mg/dl were strongly and independently correlated with less risk of PMI. Univariate logistic regression indicated that patients with preprocedural LDL-C of 70 ~ 99 mg/dl were correlated with lower risk of postprocedural cTnI elevation above 3 × ULN ( odds ratio ( OR): 0.762; 95 % ( CI): 0.603-0.965; P < 0.024) up to 20 × ULN ( OR: 0.730; 95 % CI: 0.576-0.924; P < 0.000) compared to those with preprocedural LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl. Moreover , patients with preprocedural LDL-C of < 70 mg/dl were more strongly correlated with lower risk of postprocedural cTnI elevation above 3 × ULN ( OR: 0.641; 95 % CI: 0.436-0.936; P < 0.021) up to 20 × ULN ( OR: 0.476; 95 % CI: 0.316-0.717; P < 0.000). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that PCI patients with lower preprocedural LDL-C were correlated with a lower risk of PMI in southern China.
