  Although increasing evidence has suggested the significant association between dysglycemia and hypertension , this association is less well described in prediabetes. Additionally , it is unclear how risk of hypertension varies according to the change of glycemic state. 5,413 non-diabetic Koreans were dichotomized into normoglycemia ( NG) and prediabetes group and followed-up for 10 years. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate hazard ratios ( HRs) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI) ( adjusted HRs ( 95 % CI)) for the development of hypertension. Subgroup analysis was conducted in subdivided glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) with < 5.7 % , 5.7-5.9 % and 6.0-6.4 % and 2 hour post-load glucose ( 2hr-PG) with < 140mg/dL , 140-169mg/ dL and 170-199mg/ dL. The glycemic states are NG , prediabetes and diabetes mellitus ( DM) , which are used in evaluating the change of glycemic state during follow-up in baseline NG ( NG → NG , NG → prediabetes , NG → DM) and baseline prediabetes ( prediabetes → prediabetes , prediabetes → DM). Compared to normoglycemia , prediabetes was not significantly associated with the risk of hypertension ( 1.11 ( 0.997- 1.23)). HbA1c ≥ 5.7 % ( 1.13 ( 1.02- 1.26)) and 2 hr PG ≥ 140mg/dL ( 1.15 ( 1.004- 1.31)) were marginally associated with the risk of hypertension. In subgroup analysis , only 2hr-PG of 170-199mg/ dL showed the significantly increased risk of hypertension ( 1.37 ( 1.09- 1.73)). Compared to the maintaining glycemic state , the progression of glycemic state had the significantly increased risk of hypertension ( NG → prediabetes; 1.41 ( 1.19- 1.67) , NG → DM; 1.77 ( 1.36- 2.30) and prediabetes → DM; 1.32 ( 1.13- 1.55)). The progression of glycemic state was a strong determinant on the development of hypertension.
