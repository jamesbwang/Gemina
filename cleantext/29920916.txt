  This study evaluated the optical properties of contemporary monolithic CAD-CAM materials with different chemical compositions. Totally , 210 rectangular-shaped , A2 shade specimens ( 12 × 14 mm) were fabricated from VITA Suprinity T , VITA Enamic T , VITA Mark II , GC Cerasmart LT , Lava Ultimate LT , IPS e.max CAD LT and Prettau Anterior blocks and polished to thicknesses of 0.5 ± 0.01 and 1.0 ± 0.01 mm ( n = 15 each material). A dental spectrophotometer ( VITA Easyshade Compact) was used to calculate the translucency parameter ( TP) and opalescence parameter ( OP) values of all tested materials. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance , multiple comparison Tukey 's test and independent samples t-test ( P = .05). In the 0.5-mm thickness group , GC Cerasmart and Prettau Anterior had the highest and lowest translucency values , respectively. VITA Suprinity had the highest OP value , whereas VITA Mark II and Prettau Anterior had the lowest OP values. In the 1.0-mm thickness group , GC Cerasmart and Lava Ultimate had the highest translucency , whereas Prettau Anterior had the lowest translucency. VITA Suprinity and Prettau Anterior had the highest and lowest OP values , respectively. The optical properties of monolithic restorative materials were influenced by the type and thickness of the material used. According to the results of this study , monolithic materials with different chemical compositions have revealed different optical properties. To obtain esthetic restorations and provide shade matching with natural dentition especially for anterior teeth , monolithic materials should be carefully chosen.
