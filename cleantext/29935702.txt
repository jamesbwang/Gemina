  There has been a shift from endotracheal intubation ( ETI) toward extraglottic devices ( EGDs) for prehospital airway management. A concern exists that this may lead to more frequent cases of aspiration. This was a retrospective study using a prehospital quality assurance database. Patients were assigned to groups based on the method that ultimately managed their airways ( EGD or ETI). Cases with documented blood/emesis obscuring the airway were considered inevitable aspiration cases and excluded. Aspiration was defined by the radiology report within 48 hours. A total of 104 EGD and 152 ETI patients were identified. Aspiration data were available for 67 EGD and 94 ETI cases. Of those , 8 EGD and 3 ETI cases had blood/emesis obscuring the airway and were excluded as planned. After exclusions , there were 5 EGD and 11 ETI cases in which aspiration was later diagnosed ( EGD aspiration rate = 8 % , ETI aspiration rate = 12 %; Ï‡ In this small quality assurance database , aspiration rates were not significantly different for prehospital patients managed with an EGD versus ETI.
