  Freshwater mussels ( order Unionoida) are one of the most imperiled groups of animals in the world. However , many ambient water quality criteria and other environmental guideline values do not include data for freshwater mussels , in part because mussel toxicity test methods are comparatively new and data may not have been available when criteria and guidelines were derived. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the acute toxicity of sodium chloride ( NaCl) and potassium chloride ( KCl) to larvae ( glochidia) and/or juveniles of a unionid mussel ( fatmucket , Lampsilis siliquoidea) and to determine the potential influences of water hardness ( 50 , 100 , 200 , and 300 mg/L as CaCO
