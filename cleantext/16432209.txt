  Cell-to-cell differences in protein expression in normal tissues and tumors are a common phenomenon , but the underlying principles that govern this heterogeneity are largely unknown. Here , we show that in monolayer cancer cell-line cultures , the expression of the five metabolic enzymes of serine-glycine synthesis ( SGS) , including its rate-limiting enzyme , phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase ( PHGDH) , displays stochastic cell-to-cell variation. By contrast , in cancer cell line-derived three-dimensional ( 3D) microtumors PHGDH expression is restricted to the outermost part of the microtumors ' outer proliferative cell layer , while the four other SGS enzymes display near uniform expression throughout the microtumor. A mathematical model suggests that metabolic stress in the microtumor core activates factors that restrict PHGDH expression. Thus , intracellular enzyme expression in growing cell ecosystems can shift to spatially ordered patterns in 3D structured environments due to emergent cell-cell communication , with potential implications for the design of effective anti-metabolic cancer therapies.
