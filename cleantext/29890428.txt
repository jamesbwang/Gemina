  In the mare , early pregnancy loss is common , but involvement of the maternal immune system in the pathogenesis of this condition has not been investigated in detail so far. In the present study , we assessed effects of exposure of the endometrium to semen or seminal plasma in oestrous mares on the response of regulatory T lymphocytes ( Tregs) in the peripheral circulation as well as in the endometrium. Raw semen , seminal plasma or PBS ( control) were introduced into the uterus of oestrous mares ( n = 12). Blood was collected immediately before insemination or PBS infusion ( time 0) , and 12 , 24 and 48 h thereafter. Endometrial biopsies were collected at 24 h. In peripheral blood , Treg ( CD4
