  The aim of the present study was to verify the effects of heavy metal coupling agents ( sodium citrate and EDTA) and antioxidants ( acetyl carnitine and lipoic acid) on the number of oocytes , as well as the ageing of mitochondria , chromosomes and spindles in mice. C57BL/6 female mice were randomly classified into four groups ( n = 12 per group): i) Heavy metal coupling agent; ii) antioxidant; iii) mixed group; and iv) the normal control group. For the treatments , heavy metal coupling agents and antioxidants were added to the drinking water provided to the mice. Following 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months of treatment , the number of oocytes and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined , and chromosome and spindle structures were observed. With increasing age , the experimental mice in the four groups showed significantly decreased numbers of oocytes , reduced mitochondrial activity , and increased rates of spindle and chromosome abnormalities , which indicated ageâ€‘induced ageing of mouse oocytes; thus , a mouse ageing oocyte model had been successfully established. For mice of the same age , more oocytes , higher mitochondrial activity , and lower spindle and chromosome malformation rates were detected in the antioxidant and mixed groups when compared with the normal control groups. Furthermore , no significant difference in the number of oocytes , mitochondrial activity or chromosome malformation rates was observed between the heavy metal coupling agent group and normal control group , which was possibly due to less metal being absorbed during the breeding process. Therefore , the results demonstrated that the antioxidants acetyl carnitine and lipoic acid may serve a role in delaying oocyte ageing.
