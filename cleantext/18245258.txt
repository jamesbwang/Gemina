  Lyme<disease> disease<disease> , a typical tick-borne disease , imposes increasing global public health challenges. A growing body of theoretical models have been proposed to better understand various factors determining the disease risk , which not only enrich our understanding on the ecological cycle of disease transmission but also promote new theoretical developments on model formulation , analysis and simulation. In this paper , we provide a review about the models and results we have obtained recently on modeling and analyzing Lyme<disease> disease<disease> transmission , with the purpose to highlight various aspects in the ecological cycle of disease transmission to be incorporated , including the growth of ticks with different stages in the life cycle , the seasonality , host diversity , spatial disease pattern due to host short distance movement and bird migration , co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens , and climate change impact.
