  In the field of sexually transmitted infections ( STI) , the cervicovaginal explant ( CVEx) model , not only provides the opportunity to study the different immunological arms present in these tissues under steady state conditions , but also their response against ex vivo infection with relevant pathogens. The methodology associated to the establishment of the HIV<pathogen> infection model in the cervicovaginal tissue was described in detail by Grivel et al. earlier ( Grivel and Margolis , 2009). With this model as a foundation , we illustrate different approaches to obtain a large number of immunological readouts from a single piece of tissue , thus maximizing the immunological output obtained. Additionally , we discuss several ideas to study some of the immunological subsets present in this mucosal tissue by enriching them with the addition of distinct chemokines or specifically inducing their activation. Importantly , most of the methodology and concepts proposed here can be applied to study the immune subsets resident in other tissues. In the field of mucosal immunology , the possibility of studying resident immune subsets from tissue explants offers a great opportunity to understand the real players against invading pathogens and localized pathologies. Furthermore , this model allows for addressing the therapeutic benefit of modulating the activity of certain molecules and immune subsets against invading pathogens , which may infer their contribution to pathogen control and direct novel therapeutic interventions.
