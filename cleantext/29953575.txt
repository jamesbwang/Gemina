  Significant fluid retention is common after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of hypertonic saline-hydroxyethyl starch ( HS-HES) solution on fluid accumulation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery ( CABG). Fifty adult male patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery were enrolled in this interventional , randomized , double-blinded study to compare HS-HES with saline solution. The study fluid ( 250 mL) was given into the venous reservoir of the CPB circuit at the time of aortic declamping. Body mass change from the baseline to the first postoperative morning was significantly less in the HS-HES group compared with the control group ( 3.3 ± 1.5 kg vs. 4.4 ± 1.5 kg , P = 0.022). In the extracellular water ( ECW) or ECW-balance , there were no significant differences between the groups. The need for fluids and diuretic medication did not differ between the groups during the perioperative period. Our study shows that 250 mL of HS-HES solution can reduce perioperative fluid accumulation to some degree in patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB.
