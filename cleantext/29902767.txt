  Thyroid cancer holds the first place of the malignant tumors of the endocrine system. One of the less common thyroid cancers is follicular thyroid carcinoma ( FTC) , which is very difficult to diagnose because it gives the same image as adenoma , which is benign. Certainty of the diagnosis is gained only when FTC gives metastases. Therefore , it was decided to compare normal and neoplastic ( FTC) thyroid tissues with Fourier Transform Infrared ( FTIR) spectroscopy. The obtained FTIR spectra and Principal Component Analysis ( PCA) allowed us to conclude that there are differences in the FTIR spectrum between normal tissues and those affected by cancer. In addition , the results indicate that there is a decrease in the number of functional groups that build cellular and tissue structures in tumoral tissues. The shifts of wave numbers corresponding to the protein and lipid function group vibrations , as well as the calculated second derivative of the FTIR spectra showed the structural changes in neoplastic tissues. Moreover , the deconvolution of the amide I massif indicates that in cancerous tissues the prevailing secondary structure is β-sheet structure , while in normal tissues it is α-helix. The obtained results allow us to conclude that infrared spectroscopy , in addition to providing information on the composition of tested samples , can be an excellent diagnostic tool contributing to understanding the FTC substrate.
