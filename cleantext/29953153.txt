  The enantioselective synthesis of spirocycles has long been pursued by organic chemists. Despite their unique 3D properties and presence in several natural products , the difficulty in their enantioselective synthesis makes them underrepresented in pharmaceutical libraries. Since the first pioneering reports of the enantioselective construction of spirosilanes by Tamao et al. , significant effort has been devoted towards the development of new promising asymmetric methodologies. Remarkably , with the advent of organocatalysis , particularly over six years , the reported methodologies for the synthesis of spirocycles have increased exponentially. The aim of this review is to summarize the latest trends and developments in the enantioselective synthesis of spirocompounds during these last six years.
