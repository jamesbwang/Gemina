  Maté is a beverage regularly consumed by Latin American populations. Upper<symptom> aerodigestive tract ( UADT) cancers are frequent in this region and are suspected to be associated with maté consumption. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to answer a focused question: `` Is there an association between maté consumption and occurrence of the UADT cancer? ''. Studies investigating any association between maté consumption and occurrence of UADT cancer were included. Out of the 569 studies , 18 met the inclusion criteria for qualitative and 15 for quantitative analysis. An increased odds was observed regarding maté consumption and overall occurrence of UADT cancer ( OR = 2.24; 95 % CI = 1.74-2.87). Consistent evidence of a positive association was found for all UADT subsites , oral , pharynx , esophagus and larynx. No differences in effect were found between consumption of cold/warm and hot/very hot mate ( OR = 1.08; 95 % CI = 0.83-1.41). Consumption of more than one liter of maté per day was associated with increased odds of having UADT cancer compared to an intake of less than one liter per day ( OR = 1.72; 95 % CI = 1.47-2.01). According to published data , regardless of the temperature , maté consumption significantly increased the odds of occurrence of UADT cancer.
