  Breast augmentation surgery is still 1 of the most popular procedures in plastic surgery. Like other surgical procedures , it has been traditionally handled with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics , which had many adverse effects; therefore , alternatives with the same effectiveness are being researched. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of ropivacaine breast pocket irrigation during primary breast augmentation surgery to control pain during the first postoperative hours. A multicenter , prospective , double-blind , randomized trial was performed on 52 primary breast augmentation procedures in which patients served as their own control: One breast received ropivacaine pocket irrigation and the other placebo. All patients received an oral analgesic. Pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale at 30 , 60 , 90 , and 120 minutes postoperatively. Pain was significantly less in ropivacaine breast at 90 and 120 minutes postoperatively ( Ropivacaine irrigation in breast pocket is able to diminish early postoperative pain safely , being an alternative to other analgesic methods.
