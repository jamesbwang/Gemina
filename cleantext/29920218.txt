  The role of dyslipidemia in the development of retinal dysfunction remains poorly understood. Using an animal model of diet-induced obesity/pre-type 2 diabetes , we investigated molecular defects in the retina arising from consumption of a diet high in saturated fats and sugars ( i.e. , a Western diet). We found that feeding mice a Western diet increased the abundance of retinal sphingolipids , attenuated protein kinase B ( Akt) phosphorylation , enhanced JNK activation , and increased retinal cell death. When we used palmitate or C6-ceramide ( Cer) to assess sphingolipid-mediated signaling in cultured murine and human cells , we observed similar effects on Akt , JNK , and cell death. Furthermore , both Western diet and C6-Cer exposure enhanced expression of the stress-response protein regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 ( REDD1) and loss of REDD1 increased C6-Cer-induced JNK activation and cell death. Exogenous REDD1 expression repressed JNK-mediated phosphorylation in cultured cells. We found that thioredoxin-interacting protein ( TXNIP) expression was elevated in REDD1-deficient cell lines and C6-Cer promoted TXNIP expression in both wild-type and REDD1-deficient cells. Likewise , TXNIP knockdown attenuated JNK activation and caspase 3 cleavage after either C6-Cer exposure or REDD1 deletion. The results support a model wherein Cer-induced REDD1 expression attenuates TXNIP-dependent JNK activation and retinal cell death.-Dai , W. , Miller , W. P. , Toro , A. L. , Black , A.
