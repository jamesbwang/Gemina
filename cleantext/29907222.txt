  Addition of en bloc segmental venous reconstruction ( VR) to pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD) for venous involvement of pancreatic tumors increases the complexity of the operation and may increase complications. The long-term mesenteric venous patency rate and oncologic outcome has not been well defined. Our prospective database was reviewed to assess 90-day postoperative outcomes for patients who underwent PD or PD + VR ( September 2004-June 2016). Two independent observers reviewed CT scans to determine long-term vein patency. In patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma , the impact of VR on 5-year overall survival was assessed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. Student 's t-test was used to evaluate continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Three hundred ninety-three patients underwent PD ( 51 PD + VR). Patients undergoing PD + VR had longer operations ( 561 ± 119 versus 433 ± 89 min , P < 0.00001) and greater blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 768 ± 812 versus 327 ± 423 cc , P < 0.00001). There was no difference in 90-day mortality , overall postoperative complication rates , complication severity grades , reoperation , readmission , or length of stay. 26.7 % experienced venous thrombosis. Most thromboses occurred in the first year after surgery , but we also observed late thrombosis in 1 patient after 89-month follow-up. Among 135 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma , survival was significantly longer in the PD-alone group ( 31.3 months ( 95 % confidence interval: 22.9-40.0) versus 17.0 ( 95 % confidence interval: 13.0-19.1) , p PD + VR does not increase short-term morbidity , but venous thrombosis is frequent and can occur long after surgery. Survival is inferior when VR is required especially in the absence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
