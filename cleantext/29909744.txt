  This paper discusses motivations for the use of MDMA among young adults in intimate relationships living in resource poor environments , where structural constraints limit potential for economic mobility and impact upon interpersonal relations. Drawing from in-depth interviews with men and women in intimate relationships with one or more partners , we report the range of motivations for MDMA use and their association with indicators of relationship quality , specifically trust and romantic exclusivity. Findings demonstrate that both men and women use MDMA primarily for the purpose of sexual enjoyment. However , men report the use of MDMA for sexual enjoyment more often , while women more frequently report the use of MDMA to compensate for psychological or physical displeasure , particularly in relationships characterised by distrust. We discuss how these motivations to use MDMA are shaped by gender norms and larger contextual and socio-economic factors and conclude with a call for more relational and sexual counselling opportunities for urban young adults to avoid MDMA use for self-medication.
