  Abnormality of dopamine D2 receptor ( D2R) function , often observed as D2R supersensitivity ( D2RSS) , is a commonality of schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders in humans. Moreover , virtually all psychotherapeutic agents for schizophrenia target D2R in brain. Permanent D2RSS as a feature of a new animal model of schizophrenia was first reported in 1991 , then behaviorally and biochemically characterized over the next 15-20 years. In this model of schizophrenia characterized by production of D2RSS in ontogeny , there are demonstrated alterations of signaling processes; as well as functional links between the biologic template of the animal model; and ability of pharmacotherapeutics to modulate or reverse biological and behavioral modalities towards normality. Another such animal model , featuring knockout of Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 ( TAAR1) , demonstrates D2RSS with an increase of the proportion of D2R in the high affinity state. Currently , TAAR1 agonists are being explored as a therapeutic option for schizophrenia. There is likewise an overlay of D2RSS with substance use disorder. The aspect of adenosine A2A-D2 heteroreceptor complexes in substance use disorder is highlighted , and the association of A2AR antagonists in discriminative and rewarding effects of psychostimulants is outlined. In summary , these new animal models of schizophrenia have face validity , construct validity and predictive validity , and with distinct advantages over earlier models. While the review summarizes elements of D2RSS in schizophrenia per se , and its interplay with substance use disorder , a major focus is on presumed new molecular targets attending D2RSS in schizophrenia and related clinical entities.
