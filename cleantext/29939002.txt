  Inspired by `` water ripples '' in nature and the flocculation phenomenon in colloid chemistry , a novel liquid drop/colloid flocculation approach is developed to fabricate an extremely flexible and compressible 3D macroscopic graphene-based architecture ( hydrogels or aerogels) , via a new coagulation-induced self-assembly mechanism. This facile and universal technique can be achieved in a neutral , acidic , or basic coagulation bath , producing microsized hydrogels with various structures , such as mushroom , circle , disc shapes , etc.. The method also allows us to introduce various guest materials in the graphene matrix using transition metal salts as the coagulating bath. A mushroom-shaped NiCo oxide/GS hybrid aerogel ( diameter: 3 mm) is prepared as an example , with ultrathin NiCo oxide nanosheets in situ grown onto the surface of graphene. By employing as binder-free electrodes , these hybrid aerogels exhibit a specific capacitance of 858.3 F g
