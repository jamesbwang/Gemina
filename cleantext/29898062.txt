  The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical , radiographic and histological outcomes of the dentin-pulp complex from primary molars after pulpotomy with mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA) and 15.5 % ferric sulfate ( FS). Thirty-one primary molars were randomly allocated into MTA or FS groups. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were recorded at 3- , 6- , 12- and 18-month follow-up. Teeth at the regular exfoliation period were extracted and processed for histological analysis. Clinical and radiographic data were tested by statistical analysis ( p â‰¤ 0.01). Histological outcomes were analyzed descriptively. All of the treated teeth presented clinical success over the experimental periods. Both groups exhibited 100 % of radiographic success at 3 , 6 and 12 months. At the 18-month follow-up , one tooth from FS group presented inter-radicular radiolucency ( p > 0.01). Histologically , the treated teeth presented pulp vitality and absence of inflammatory infiltrate into the connective tissue. Only MTA group showed hard tissue barrier surrounded by odontoblasts over the pulp stumps. Both MTA and 15.5 % FS are effective for pulpotomies of primary teeth. Although MTA is considered the first-choice material , FS may be a suitable alternative when treatment cost is an issue.
