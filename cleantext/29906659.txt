  The popular protocol used to study running motion suffers from problems that lead to a limited ability to generalize the obtained results. Inertial measurement units ( IMU) appear to be promising in increasing ecological validity of the collected data. However , quantifying running kinematics utilizing IMU signals is complex and potentially affected by several well-established and less well-known errors. The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of kinematic variables obtained from a single , shoe-mounted IMU using an opto-electronic motion analysis reference system. 51 recreational runners were analyzed , performing a single continuous run at three different speeds ( 10 , 12 , 15 km/h) on a treadmill. Descriptive statistics ( Bland & Altman analysis , box plots , scatter plots) were employed to analyze the agreement between the two instruments. The findings of this study revealed considerable systematic and large random disagreement , which , in turn , is characterized by substantial inter-individual differences in the error distribution. These discrepancies may partly be explained by differences in foot strike behavior , resulting in varying degrees of vibration impact acting on the IMU. Advances in IMU technology , as well as exploring new application approaches and signal processing strategies , might enhance the usability of IMUs in analyzing running kinematics.
