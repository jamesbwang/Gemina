  Magnesium lithospermate B ( MLB) is a new drug marketed in China to treat angina , but its low oral bioavailability limits its clinical application to the intravenous route. Paradoxically , orally administered low-dose MLB was found to alleviate kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy ( DN) rats , but its mechanism of action remains unknown. In recent years , the kidney-gut axis has been suspected to be involved in kidney damage pathogenesis , potentially representing a non-classical pathway for pharmacologic intervention.
