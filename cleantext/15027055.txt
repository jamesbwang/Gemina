  Botulinum<pathogen> toxin A is produced by anaerobic spore-forming bacteria and is used for various therapeutic and cosmetic purposes. Botulinum<pathogen> toxin A injections are the most popular nonsurgical procedure worldwide. Despite an increased demand for botulinum<pathogen> toxin A injections , the clinical pharmacology and differences in formulation of commonly available products are poorly understood. The various products available in the market are unique and vary in terms of units , chemical properties , biological activities , and weight , and are therefore not interchangeable. For safe clinical practice and to achieve optimal results , the practitioners need to understand the clinical issues of potency , conversion ratio , and safety issues ( toxin spread and immunogenicity). In this paper , the basic clinical pharmacology of botulinum<pathogen> toxin A and differences between onabotulinum toxin A , abobotulinum toxin A , and incobotulinum toxin A are discussed.
