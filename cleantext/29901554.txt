  Assessing the seroprevalence and the prevalence of definite Coeliac disease ( CD) in the German LIFE Child Health study cohort including IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase ( IgA-TTG) in addition to IgG antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides ( IgG-DGP) as well as HLA-DQ2/ 8 genotyping. Samples from children and adolescents were first screened for IgA-TTG and IgG-DGP. If IgA-TTG was above 0.5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN) and/or IgG-DGP was positive , IgA antibodies against endomysium ( IgA-EmA) were measured and HLA was genotyped. In patients with only IgG-DGP positivity , total IgA was assayed. Subjects with suspicious results were followed-up serologically and , in case of repeatedly positive antibody results , invited for a personal interview. Further diagnostic data were obtained independent from our study. We screened 2,363 children 's blood samples collected from 2011 to 2015. The seroprevalence , i.e. IgA-TTG and/or IgA-EmA positivity or IgG-DGP positivity with IgA < 0.05 g/l , was 1.57 % ( CI95 % 1.14-2.15). The prevalence of suspected CD , i.e. seroprevalence and compatible HLA genotype with hitherto unknown mucosal damage , was 1.35 % ( CI95 % 0.96-1.91). Definite CD , i.e. seropositivity accompanied by positive intestinal biopsy or IgA-TTG ≥ 10 × upper limit of normal , was found in 0.42 % ( CI95 % 0.22-0.80). Seven children claimed to have CD. However , the HLA haplotype matched in only four of them resulting in an overall CD prevalence of at least 0.59 % ( CI95 % 0.34-1.02). Thirteen unclear cases remained , therefore the prevalence might even be higher. The prevalence of definite CD in a population-representative German cohort is higher than previously described. HLA-DQ typing is helpful to identify false-positive IgA-TTG patients negative for IgA-EmA and/or IgG-DGP under screening conditions and unmasks possible misdiagnoses of CD.
