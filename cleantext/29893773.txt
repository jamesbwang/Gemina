  Anatomo-clinical evidence from motor-awareness disorders after brain-damages suggests that the premotor cortex ( PMC) is involved in motor-monitoring of voluntary actions. Indeed , PMC lesions<symptom> prevent patients from detecting the mismatch between intended , but not executed , movements with the paralyzed limb. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared , in healthy subjects , free movements against blocked movements , precluded by a cast. Cast-related corticospinal excitability changes were investigated by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Immediately after the immobilization , when the cast prevented the execution of left-hand movements , the contralateral right ( ventral) vPMC showed both increased hemodynamic activity and increased functional connectivity with the hand area in the right somatosensory cortex , suggesting a vPMC involvement in detecting the mismatch between planned and executed movements. Crucially , after 1 week of immobilization , when the motor system had likely learned that no movement could be executed and , therefore , predictions about motor consequences were changed , vPMC did not show the enhanced activity as if no incongruence has to be detected. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the plastic changes induced by long-lasting immobilization , as also proved by the cast-related corticospinal excitability modulation in our subjects. The present findings highlight the crucial role of vPMC in the anatomo-functional network generating the human motor-awareness.
