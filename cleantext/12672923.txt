  Until now , little research concerning the lipid-lowering and anti-obesity functions of garlic oil and onion oil has been performed. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of garlic oil and onion oil on serum lipid levels in hyperlipidemia model rats , to provide a scientific basis for the prevention of hyperlipidemia through a dietary approach , and to explore the potential health benefits of garlic and onion. Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into eight groups based on their body<symptom> weight and serum levels of triglycerides ( TG) and total cholesterol ( TC). The rats received repeated oral administration of volatile oils extracted from garlic and onion for 60 days. Serum lipids and parameters of obesity were examined. The volatile oils suppressed the HFD-induced body<symptom> weight gain and tended to decrease adipose tissue weight. The oils decreased the levels of TG , TC and LDL-C and increased the serum level of HDL-C compared with the rats in the hyperlipidemia model groups ( Our results implied that garlic oil and onion oil have anti-obesity properties that can counteract the effects of an HFD on body<symptom> weight , adipose tissue weight , and serum lipid profiles.
