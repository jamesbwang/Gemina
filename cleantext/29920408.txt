  Free chlorine sunlight photolysis ( sunlight/FC) markedly enhances the degradation rate of methadone , a synthetic opioid used medically , over that obtained using sunlight alone. The pseudo-first-order rate constants of methadone degradation under acidic conditions ( ( methadone) = 0.2 μM , ( free chlorine) = 4 μM , and pH = 4) for sunlight/FC and sunlight photolysis are 7.0 ± 1.1 × 10
