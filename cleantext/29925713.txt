  The castability , mechanical properties , and fracture characteristics of Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al alloy were compared with those of Ti-6Al-7Nb alloy and pure titanium ( CP Ti) for application of this Î²-type titanium alloy in cast dental prostheses. Cast specimens were prepared with a centrifugal casting machine. A tensile test was performed according to ISO standard 22674. The castability index for Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al was lower than those for Ti-6Al-7Nb and CP Ti. The tensile strength of Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al was 852 MPa , which was lower than that of Ti-6Al-7Nb and higher than that of CP Ti. The proof strength of Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al was 799 MPa , which was comparable to that of Ti-6Al-7Nb and higher than that of CP Ti. The elastic modulus of Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al was 81.0 GPa , which was lower than the values for Ti-6Al-7Nb and CP Ti. Elongation of Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al was 5.1 % , which was comparable to that of Ti-6Al-7Nb and less than that of CP Ti. The shape of the fractured segment was narrower for Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al than for Ti-6Al-7Nb and CP Ti. The deformation characteristics of Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al may result in decreased stress relative to increased strain during plastic deformation in the stress-strain diagram. In conclusion , Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al alloy has a low elastic modulus and exhibits limited ductile plastic deformation in cast dental prostheses.
