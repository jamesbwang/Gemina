  Recrystallization of bulk materials is a well-known phenomenon , which is widely used in commercial manufacturing. However , for low-dimensional materials like graphene , this process still remains an unresolved puzzle. Thus , the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the required conditions for recrystallization in low dimensions is essential for the elaboration of routes towards the inexpensive and reliable production of high-quality nanomaterials. Here , we unveil the details of the efficient recrystallization of one-atom-thick pure and boron-doped polycrystalline graphene layers on a Co ( 0001) surface. By applying photoemission and electron diffraction , we show how more than 90 % of the initially misoriented graphene grains can be reconstructed into a well-oriented and single-crystalline layer. The obtained recrystallized graphene/Co interface exhibits high structural quality with a pronounced sublattice asymmetry , which is important for achieving an unbalanced sublattice doping of graphene. By exploring the kinetics of recrystallization for native and B-doped graphene on Co , we were able to estimate the activation energy and propose a mechanism of this process.
