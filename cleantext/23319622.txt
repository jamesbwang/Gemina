  A growing number of studies implicate the brain 's reward circuitry in aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom>. However , the cellular and molecular mechanisms within brain reward regions that modulate the intensity of aggression as well as motivation for it have been underexplored. Here , we investigate the cell-type-specific influence of ΔFosB , a transcription factor known to regulate a range of reward and motivated behaviors , acting in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc) , a key reward region , in male aggression in mice. We show that ΔFosB is specifically increased in dopamine D1 receptor ( Drd1)- expressing medium spiny neurons ( D1-MSNs) in NAc after repeated aggressive encounters. Viral-mediated induction of ΔFosB selectively in D1-MSNs of NAc intensifies aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> without affecting the preference for the aggression-paired context in a conditioned place preference ( CPP) assay. In contrast , ΔFosB induction selectively in D2-MSNs reduces the time spent exploring the aggression-paired context during CPP without affecting the intensity of aggression per se. These data strongly support a dissociable cell-type-specific role for ΔFosB in the NAc in modulating aggression and aggression reward.
