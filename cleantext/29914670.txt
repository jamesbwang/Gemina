  Dietary supplementation of oats has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and gastrointestinal disorders. The role of oat extract as prophylactic in treating acute liver injury is not thoroughly established. We , therefore , hypothesized that oat extract would exert protective effect against alcohol-induced acute liver injury in a mouse model. To test this hypothesis , male C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with phenolic-enriched ethyl acetate ( EA) fraction of oats ( prepared by fractionating aqueous ethanolic extract with solvents of increasing polarity) at dosages of 125 and 250 mg kg
