  There is an ongoing debate on the relationship between depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> , but data on similarities and differences in their predictor profiles are scarce. The aim of our study was to compare family and personality predictors of these disorders among 220 `` emerging adults. '' As such , two clinical groups with noncomorbid depressive and anxiety<symptom> disorders , and one healthy control group were assessed by sociodemographic questionnaires , Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders and NEO Personality Inventory , Revised. We found significant overlap in family and personality risk profiles , with increasing effect size for predictors common to anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> when the categories `` no disorder-anxiety disorder-depressive disorder '' were considered as existing along a continuum. Among the contributing factors we assessed , family psychiatric history , family structure and conflicts with parents were more significant than personality traits. Our study indicates that emerging adults may be more vulnerable to depression<symptom> than anxiety<symptom> in the presence of family and personality risk factors.
