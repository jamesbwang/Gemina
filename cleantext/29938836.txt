  Antagonists of IL-17A and its receptor have proven to be highly effective in the treatment of psoriasis. However , many of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis are still to be determined. IκBζ ( encoded by the NFKBIZ gene) plays a key role in the development of psoriasis by mediating IL-17A- and IL-17F-driven effects. Both IL-17A and IL-17F expression are increased in lesional psoriatic skin. IL-17A/ A and IL-17F/ F homodimers as well as the IL-17A/ F heterodimer signal through the same receptors. The aim of this study was to characterize the role of the IL-17A/ F heterodimer in the regulation of NFKBIZ expression and in the regulation of selected psoriasis-associated genes. We demonstrated that IL-17A/ F stimulation of human keratinocytes significantly induced NFKBIZ expression. Moreover , silencing IκBζ by siRNA revealed that IκBζ is a key regulator of IL-17A/ F-inducible psoriasis-associated genes , including CCL20 , DEFB4 , IL-8 , CHI3L1 and S100A7. In addition , IL-17A/ F-induced NFKBIZ expression was mediated by a mechanism involving the p38 MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways. In conclusion , we present IκBζ as a novel key regulator of IL-17A/ F-driven effects in psoriasis. Thus , antagonists to IL-17A/ F or IκBζ may present a targeted approach for treating psoriasis.
