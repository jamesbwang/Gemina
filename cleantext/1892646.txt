  Pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> is a progressive and lethal disease characterized by damage to the lung parenchyma with excess extracellular matrix deposition. The involvement of endothelial cells in fibrosis<disease> development is unclear. We isolated pulmonary endothelial cells , using a magnetic-activated cell sorting system , from mice with pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> induced by intratracheal bleomycin. We characterized endothelial cells isolated at various times in the course of pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> development. Inflammatory cell infiltration was observed at 7 days after bleomycin administration , and fibrotic changes with increased collagen content were observed on day 21. Endothelial cells were isolated at these two timepoints. Levels of von Willebrand factor , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-12 were elevated in lung endothelial cells isolated from bleomycin-treated mice at days 7 and 21. This indicated that intratracheal bleomycin administration induced endothelium injury. Expression of fibrogenic mediators , transforming growth factor ( TGF)- β , connective tissue growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor-C was elevated in the cells from bleomycin-treated , compared with untreated , lungs. When endothelial cells were treated with TGF-β , α-smooth muscle actin ( SMA) expression and collagen production were increased only in those cells from bleomycin-treated mouse lungs. Thapsigargin-induced prostaglandin I Bleomycin administration induced functional changes in lung endothelial cells , indicating potential involvement of endothelium in pulmonary fibrogenesis.
