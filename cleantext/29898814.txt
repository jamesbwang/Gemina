  Although a traditional bull breeding soundness evaluation is designed to identify bulls that are grossly abnormal , bulls classified as satisfactory potential breeders still vary in fertility , implying submicroscopic differences in sperm characteristics. Testis-specific isozyme of angiotensin-converting enzyme ( tACE) is involved in the regulation of sperm function. Therefore , the aim of the present study was to determine tACE content , activity and localisation in bull spermatozoa and their associations with fertility. Semen from low-fertility ( LF) and high-fertility ( HF) Holstein bulls ( n = 20) with known FERTSOL rates , which represents the 56-day non-return rate , were used. There was greater tACE content ( P < 0.05) and tACE activity ( P < 0.01) in HF versus LF spermatozoa. Based on immunolocalisation , tACE was either in the acrosomal or postacrosomal region of the sperm head , with HF bulls having a higher proportion of spermatozoa with tACE in the acrosomal region than LF bulls ( P < 0.05). tACE content , activity , localisation to the acrosomal region and progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> were significantly correlated with fertility and , based on regression analysis , tACE content was predictive of fertility. tACE content and activity in semen were similar between yearling ( 10-13 months old) and mature ( 3-4 years old) bulls. Therefore , tACE has potential as a marker of field fertility in bulls at their earliest possible age.
