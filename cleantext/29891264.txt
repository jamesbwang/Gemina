  Medical meetings are a tool to help physicians advance and update their medical knowledge. Their quality is the responsibility of colleges and institutions. To assess and compare the academic level of four different annual rheumatology meetings. As a source of information , we used the abstracts published in the supplements of the journal Reumatología Clínica , SE1 Vol. 12 , issued in February 2016 , SE 1 Vol. 13 issued in February 2017 , the electronic application of the 2016 ACR/ARHP of the 2016 American Congress of Rheumatology , devoted to the works presented at the 44th Mexican Congress of Rheumatology ( CMR 44) , the 45th Mexican Congress of Rheumatology ( CMR 45) , and the 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting ( ACR 2016) , as well as the Web page on the files and abstracts of EULAR 2017 , respectively; from each work we compiled information on the major disease being referred to , the type of information provided and the type of report. We should point out that some were combined conditions or designs , from which we selected that which we considered to be the most important. In all , 275 , 340 , 3275 and 4129 studies were submitted to the XLIV Mexican Congress of Rheumatology , XLV Mexican Congress of Rheumatology , the 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting and EULAR 2017 , respectively. Rheumatoid arthritis<disease> was the most common disorder , dealt with in 23 % , 26 % , 21 % and 27 % in CMR 44 , CMR 45 , 2016 ACR and EULAR 2017 , respectively , followed by systemic lupus erythematosus; in third place , Mexican congresses reported trials related to systemic vasculitis , whereas spondylitis was the main subject of international congresses. In the case of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , clinical topics accounted for 30 % in the Mexican congresses and ACR , and nearly 20 % in EULAR. Observational studies accounted for 40 % in the Mexican congresses vs. 33 % in 2016 ACR and 55 % in EULAR 2017. Studies on basic science were minimal in the Mexican congress , whereas in 2016 ACR , they represented 21 % and 12 % in EULAR 2017. Rheumatology meetings constitute a tool to obtain adequate evidence-based medical knowledge in this important branch of medicine. For our Mexican Congress , we should encourage collaborative efforts between institutions , which will result in a greater number of controlled studies , clinical trials and basic studies that support the quality of the congress. We wish to emphasize that a greater diffusion of other musculoskeletal diseases is needed , not only autoimmune diseases , since the former represent an important percentage of the daily practice.
