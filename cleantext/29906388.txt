  The information in the literature concerned with lowering the critical aggregation concentration of anionic surfactants by macrocyclic compounds is scarce. This research develops an effective route for lowering the critical aggregation concentration of anionic gemini surfactants by the complexation of calixpyridinium. Furthermore , the size of complex self-assembled nanostructures can be well controlled by the different mixing ratio of the host and the guest.
