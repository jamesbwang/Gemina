  Guided bone regeneration ( GBR) often utilizes a combination of autologous bone grafts , deproteinized bovine bone mineral ( DBBM) , and collagen membranes<symptom>. DBBM and collagen membranes<symptom> pre-coated with bone-conditioned medium ( BCM) extracted from locally harvested autologous bone chips have shown great regenerative potential in GBR. However , the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here , we investigated the composition of BCM and its activity on the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells. We detected a fast and significant ( P < 0.001) release of transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1) from autologous bone within 10 min versus a delayed bone morphogenetic protein-2 ( BMP-2) release from 40 min onwards. BCMs harvested within short time periods ( 10 , 20 , or 40 min) , corresponding to the time of a typical surgical procedure , significantly increased the proliferative activity and collagen matrix production of BCM-treated cells. Long-term ( 1 , 3 , or 6 days)- extracted BCMs promoted the later stages of osteoblast differentiation and maturation. Short-term-extracted BCMs , in which TGF-β1 but no BMP-2 was detected , reduced the expression of the late differentiation marker osteocalcin. However , when both growth factors were present simultaneously in the BCM , no inhibitory effects on osteoblast differentiation were observed , suggesting a synergistic TGF-β1/ BMP-2 activity. Consequently , in cells that were co-stimulated with recombinant TGF-β1 and BMP-2 , we showed a significant stimulatory and dose-dependent effect of TGF-β1 on BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation due to prolonged BMP signaling and reduced expression of the BMP-2 antagonist noggin. Altogether , our data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the favorable outcome from GBR procedures using BCM , derived from autologous bone grafts.
