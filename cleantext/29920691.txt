  Legumes are the world 's primary source of dietary protein and are particularly important for those in developing economies. However , the biofortification potential of legumes remains underexploited. Legumes offer a diversity of micronutrients and amino acids , exceeding or complementing the profiles of cereals. As such , the enhancement of legume nutritional composition presents an appealing target for addressing the `` hidden hunger '' of global micronutrient malnutrition. Affecting ~ 2 billion people , micronutrient malnutrition causes severe health effects ranging from stunted growth to reduced life span. An increased availability of micronutrient-enriched legumes , particularly to those in socioeconomically deprived areas , would serve the dual functions of ameliorating hidden hunger and increasing the positive health effects associated with legumes. Here , we give an updated overview of breeding approaches for the nutritional improvement of legumes and crucially , we highlight the importance of considering nutritional improvement in a wider ecological context. Specifically , we review the potential of the legume microbiome for agronomic trait improvement and highlight the need for increased genetic , biochemical and environmental data resources. Finally , we state that such resources should be complemented by an international and multidisciplinary initiative that will drive crop improvement , and most importantly , ensure that research outcomes benefit those who need them most.
