  The purpose of this study is to reanalyze data from the original 2005 Pelvic Organ Support Study ( POSST) data set to define normal values for apical Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification ( POP-Q) points C and D and total vaginal length ( TVL) in an asymptomatic population of women. In this retrospective observational data-set review , patient were > 18 years presenting for annual gynecologic exams to six centers in the United States. Data included demographics , questions about prolapse symptoms , and POP-Q points. Means and standard deviations were determined for each POP-Q point in the total population. The data set comprised 1011 women; 59 were excluded because they met criteria for having POP or were missing data. This left 948 for study. Mean age of our study population was 42 ± 14 years , and 45.6 % were white , 25.1 % black , and 25.2 % Hispanic. One hundred fifty-six had a prior hysterectomy. Mean values with standard deviations ( SD) for POP-Q values are as following: point C ( vaginal cuff) -7.3 ± 1.5 cm , point C ( cervix) -5.9 ± 1.5 , point D -8.7 cm ± 1.5 cm , TVL ( no hysterectomy) 9.8 cm ± 1.3 cm , and TVL ( hysterectomy) 8.9 cm ± 1.5 cm. This data suggests normal values for POP-Q apical points in a population of patient with annual gynecological exams.
