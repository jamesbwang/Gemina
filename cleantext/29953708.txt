  Phylogenetic analyses of trait evolution can provide insight into the evolutionary processes that initiate and drive phenotypic diversification. However , recent phylogenomic studies have revealed extensive gene tree-species tree discordance , which can lead to incorrect inferences of trait evolution if only a single species tree is used for analysis. This phenomenon-dubbed `` hemiplasy ''- is particularly important to consider during analyses of character evolution in rapidly radiating groups , where discordance is widespread. Here , we generate whole-transcriptome data for a phylogenetic analysis of 14 species in the plant genus Jaltomata ( the sister clade to Solanum) , which has experienced rapid , recent trait evolution , including in fruit and nectar colour , and flower size and shape. Consistent with other radiations , we find evidence for rampant gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting ( ILS) and to introgression events among the well-supported subclades. As both ILS and introgression increase the probability of hemiplasy , we perform several analyses that take discordance into account while identifying genes that might contribute to phenotypic evolution. Despite discordance , the history of fruit colour evolution in Jaltomata can be inferred with high confidence , and we find evidence of de novo adaptive evolution at individual genes associated with fruit colour variation. In contrast , hemiplasy appears to strongly affect inferences about floral character transitions in Jaltomata , and we identify candidate loci that could arise either from multiple lineage-specific substitutions or standing ancestral polymorphisms. Our analysis provides a generalizable example of how to manage discordance when identifying loci associated with trait evolution in a radiating lineage.
