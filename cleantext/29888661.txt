  Modern information and communication tools have increasingly become an indispensable part of our everyday life. Research data demonstrate that it can be used effectively to preserve and restore health , not just among young people but also among the elderly , as for nowadays the use of the internet is widespread among the elderly , but healthcare applications are less well-known. This supports the significance of our project since it is important to develop and introduce disease-specific healthcare applications. Our preliminary results also indicated that men are less open to these new technologies , so in their case , specific methods are needed to facilitate the use of electronic devices. The high level of internet activity and the interest in information and communication technologies provide a reliable basis for applying these new technologies to the elderly. Thus , based on our research , we can develop a complex model of care based on the bio-psycho-social principles , which can be a significant advance in the prevention and early detection of age-related mental disorders and in alleviating the physical and psychological burdens of people with dementia and their families.
