  We analyzed the changes in absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count and its changes over time in 139 patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. The baseline absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count was defined as the median of absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count levels measured during 30 days before preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count at 1 month , 0.5 to 1 year , 1 to 2 years , and 2 to 3 years were determined by the median values of the absolute lymphocyte<symptom> counts during the respective periods. Absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count decreased after delivering preoperative chemoradiotherapy , reached minimum level at 1 month , and then gradually increased after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. Baseline absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count had significant correlations with the absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count of every period ( range of coefficient , 0.41-0.64 , P < .001). The overall survival of the group with high baseline absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count was significantly higher than that of the group with low baseline absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count ( 5-year overall survival: 82.4 % vs 62.9 % , P = .012). In multivariable analyses , the baseline absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count remained as a significant prognostic factor for overall survival , favoring the group with a high baseline absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count ( hazard ratio = 0.405 , P = .017). This study showed that the level of baseline absolute lymphocyte<symptom> count was an independent prognostic factor , and it correlated with the absolute lymphocyte<symptom> counts across varying periods of treatments and follow-up in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma.
