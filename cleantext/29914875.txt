  Long-term potentiation ( LTP) is commonly considered as the cellular correlate of learning and memory. In learning and memory<symptom> impairments<symptom> , LTP is invariably markedly diminished in the hippocampus , the brain region responsible for memory formation. LTP is measured electrophysiologically in various areas of the hippocampus. Two mechanistically distinct phases of LTP have been identified: early-phase LTP ( E-LTP; related to short-term memory) and late-phase LTP ( L-LTP; related to long-term memory). These two forms can be severely reduced in a variety of conditions and have been shown to be rescued by treatment with nicotine. This report reviews the literature on the beneficial effect of nicotine on LTP in conditions that compromise learning and memory.
