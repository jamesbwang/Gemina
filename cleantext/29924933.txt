  CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing requires delivery of a guide RNA sequence and donor DNA for targeted homologous recombination. Typically , single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide , serving as the donor template , and a plasmid encoding guide RNA are delivered as two separate components. However , in the multiplexed generation of single nucleotide variants , this two-component delivery system is limited by difficulty of delivering a matched pair of sgRNA and donor DNA to the target cell. Here , we describe a novel codelivery system called `` sgR-DNA '' that uses a linearized double-stranded DNA consisting of donor DNA component and a component encoding sgRNA. Our sgR-DNA-based method is simple to implement because it does not require cloning steps. We also report the potential of our delivery system to generate multiplex genomic substitutions in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and human cells.
