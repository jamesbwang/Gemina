  Longitudinally oriented microstructures are essential for a nerve scaffold to promote the significant regeneration of injured peripheral axons across nerve gaps. In the current study , we present a novel nerve-guiding collagen-chitosan ( CCH) scaffold that facilitated the repair of 30 mm-long sciatic nerve defects in beagles. The CCH scaffolds were observed with a scanning electron microscope. Eighteen beagles were equally divided into CCH group , autograft group and non-graft group. The posture<symptom> and gait of each dog was recorded at 12 and 24 weeks after surgery. Electrophysiological tests , Fluoro-Gold retrograde tracing test , Histological assessment of gastrocnemius and immunofluorescent staining of nerve regeneration were performed. Our investigation of regenerated sciatic nerves indicated that a CCH scaffold strongly supported directed axon regeneration in a manner similar to that achieved by autologous nerve transplantation. In vivo animal experiments showed that the CCH scaffold achieved nerve regeneration and functional recovery equivalent to that achieved by an autograft but without requiring the exogenous delivery of regenerative agents or cell transplantation. We conclude that CCH nerve guides show great promise as a method for repairing peripheral nerve defects.
