  This study aims to retrospectively analyze the salvage treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with early stage locoregionally recurrent ( LRR) extranodal natural killer ( NK)/ T-cell lymphoma , nasal type ( ENKTCL). Between January 1995 and December 2014 , 540 patients with stage IE-IIE ENKTCL received chemotherapy ( ChT) and/or radiotherapy ( RT) in our hospital , and among these , 56 patients who experienced LRR were included in this study. Salvage treatments included RT alone in 4 patients ( 7.1 %) , ChT alone in 30 patients ( 53.6 %) , and ChT combined with RT in 22 patients ( 39.3 %). Median RT dose was 50 Gy ( range 36-60 Gy). The effect of salvage treatment on overall survival ( OS) rate from start of initial treatment ( IT) as well as that after recurrence was analyzed. The overall median follow-up time from IT was 35.9 months , with a 3-year OS of 72.7 %. The median follow-up time after relapse was 14.8 months , and the 3-year OS after relapse was 57.8 %. Compared to ChT alone ( n = 30) , treatment with salvage RT ( n = 26) improved the OS from IT ( Salvage RT improved survival in patients with LRR stage IE-IIE ENKTCL , and the treatment toxicity was acceptable.
