  Cerebrospinal fluid cutaneous fistula<disease> is a rare but potentially serious complication of epidural analgesia. We report the case of a patient submitted to total knee arthroplasty under subarachnoid block and placement of lumbar epidural catheter for post-operative analgesia. The epidural catheter was found exteriorised on the fourth post-operative day , and the patient presented with a moderate fluid leak from the puncture site that was confirmed to be cerebrospinal fluid by cytological and chemical analysis. The initial therapeutic approach consisted of bed rest , hydration and prophylactic antibiotic therapy for 3 days , but it was ineffective as the leak persisted. A suture was placed at the epidural insertion site with immediate resolution of the leak. The suture was maintained for 5 days. The patient progressed satisfactorily without requiring further therapies.
