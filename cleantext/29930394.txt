  Malignant hyperthermia<symptom> ( MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder arising from uncontrolled muscle calcium release due to an abnormality in the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR) calcium-release mechanism triggered by halogenated inhalational anesthetics. However , the molecular mechanisms involved are still incomplete. We aimed to identify transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( TRPV1) variants within the entire coding sequence in patients who developed sensitivity to MH of unknown etiology. In vitro and in vivo functional studies were performed in heterologous expression system , trpv1 We identified TRPV1 variants in two patients and their heterologous expression in muscles of trpv1 We propose that TRPV1 contributes to MH and could represent an actionable therapeutic target for prevention of the pathology and also be responsible for MH sensitivity when mutated.
