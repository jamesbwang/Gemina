  This unit describes the application of `` synthetic genetics , '' i.e. , the replication of xeno nucleic acids ( XNAs) , artificial analogs of DNA and RNA bearing alternative backbone or sugar congeners , to the directed evolution of synthetic oligonucleotide ligands ( XNA aptamers) specific for target proteins or nucleic acid motifs , using a cross-chemistry selective exponential enrichment ( X-SELEX) approach. Protocols are described for synthesis of diverse-sequence XNA repertoires ( typically 10
