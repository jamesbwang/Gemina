  The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of an experimental moisturizing mouthwash versus water only in participants experiencing dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , including those with Sjögren syndrome<symptom> ( n = 28). Participants were randomized to the experimental mouthwash group ( n = 53) or the water-only group ( n = 47). For 8 days , the mouthwash group used 1 to 2 doses/day at home; both groups could sip water , as needed. Supervised treatment occurred on days 1 , 3 , and 8 , and during this treatment , before and after administration , participants completed the Product Performance and Attributes Questionnaire parts 1 through 4. Significant between-treatment differences on all Product Performance and Attributes Questionnaire questions were shown at most time points. On day 8 , at 120 minutes , there was a significant difference on Product Performance and Attributes Questionnaire 3-Question 1 ( `` Relieves the discomfort of dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> ''; the predefined primary efficacy variable) in favor of mouthwash versus water ( 0.63 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.17-1.10); P = .0084). Subgroup analysis found a significant difference that favored mouthwash in participants without Sjögren syndrome<symptom> ( 0.67 ( 0.11,1.23); P = .0203) but not with Sjögren syndrome<symptom> ( 0.52 ( -0.35,1.38; P = .2272). Eight , non-serious , oral treatment-related adverse events were reported by the mouthwash group. The findings of a subjective questionnaire showed that an experimental moisturizing mouthwash provided greater relief than water only from dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> symptoms<symptom> over 8 days.
