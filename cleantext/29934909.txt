  The assessment of acute toxicity of chemicals by in silico methods is actually done by two methodologies , read-across and QSAR. The two approaches are strongly based on the similarity between the chemical for which a risk assessment is required and the reference chemical ( s) for which the experimental data are known. Here , we describe the two methodologies with some main publications as illustrations and the in silico data associated with acute toxicity endpoints ( ECHA , REACH) accessible via eChemPortal.
