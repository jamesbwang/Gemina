  Pulmonary artery hypertension ( PAH) is characterized by remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries , leading to a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular failure. In this study , we aimed to share our 10 years of experience dealing with pulmonary hypertension ( PH) and provide information in real-life settings in terms of demographics , clinical course , PH subgroup distribution , and treatment patterns in patients with PAH in a tertiary center. In this retrospective , single-center , observational study , we screened the patients who applied to PH outpatient clinic of İstanbul University Institute of Cardiology due to the suspicion of PAH between 2008 and 2017. While group 1 , 4 , and 5 PH patients were included , group 2 and 3 PH patients were excluded from the study. Our study group comprised 162 patients ( 115 females , 71 %). The female: male ratio was 2.4. The mean age was 52 ± 16 years. Most ( 86.4 %) of the patients were in group 1 PH ( PAH). The rest ( 13.6 % , n = 22) of the patients were in group 4 PH ( chronic thromboembolic PH). In group 1 PH , 45.7 % of patients ( n = 64) were classified as having idiopathic PAH ( IPAH) after excluding the alternative diagnosis using PH diagnostic algorithm. The remaining 54.3 % of group 1 PH patients ( n = 76) had various diseases that caused PAH , which is called associated PAH ( APAH); APAH group included PAH associated with congenital heart diseases ( n = 70) , connective tissue disorders ( scleroderma , n = 4) and portal hypertension ( n = 2). Our data provides important information in real-life settings in terms of demographics , clinical course , PH subgroup distribution , and treatment patterns in patients with PAH in a reference tertiary center in Turkey.
