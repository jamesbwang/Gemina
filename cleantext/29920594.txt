  Epidemiologic studies have supported inverse associations between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D and cardiometabolic risk markers , but few randomized trials have investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on these markers in adolescents. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of winter-time cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3) supplementation on cardiometabolic risk markers in white , healthy 14- to 18-y-old adolescents in the UK ( 51 ° N) as part of the ODIN Project. In a dose-response trial , 110 adolescents ( mean ± SD age: 15.9 ± 1.4 y; 43 % male; 81 % normal weight) were randomly assigned to receive 0 , 10 or 20 μg/d vitamin D3 for 20 wk ( October-March). Cardiometabolic risk markers including BMI-for-age z score ( BMIz) , waist circumference , systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , fasting plasma triglycerides , cholesterol ( total , HDL , LDL , and total: HDL) , and glucose were measured at baseline and endpoint as secondary outcomes , together with serum 25 ( OH) D. Intervention effects were evaluated in linear regression models as between-group differences at endpoint , adjusted for the baseline value of the outcome variable and additionally for age , sex , Tanner stage , BMIz , and baseline serum 25 ( OH) D. Mean ± SD baseline serum 25 ( OH) D was 49.1 ± 12.3 nmol/L and differed between groups at endpoint with concentrations of 30.7 ± 8.6 , 56.6 ± 12.4 , and 63.9 ± 10.6 nmol/L in the 0 , 10 , and 20 μg/d groups , respectively ( P ≤ 0.001). Vitamin D3 supplementation had no effect on any of the cardiometabolic risk markers ( all P > 0.05) , except for lower HDL ( -0.12 mmol/L; 95 % CI: -0.21 , 0.04 mmol/L; P = 0.003) and total cholesterol ( -0.21 mmol/L; 95 % CI: -0.42 , 0.00 mmol/L; P = 0.05) in the 20 μg/d than in the 10 μg/d group , which disappeared in the fully adjusted analysis ( P = 0.27 and P = 0.30 , respectively). Supplementation with vitamin D3 at 10 and 20 μg/d , which increased serum 25 ( OH) D concentrations during the winter-time , had no effect on markers of cardiometabolic risk in healthy 14- to 18-y-old adolescents. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02150122.
