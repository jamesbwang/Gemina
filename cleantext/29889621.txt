  Residential care facilities operating without a state license are known to house vulnerable adults. Such unlicensed care homes ( UCHs) commonly operate illegally , making them difficult to investigate. We conducted an exploratory , multimethod qualitative study of UCHs , including 18 subject matter expert interviews and site visits to three states , including a total of 30 stakeholder interviews , to understand UCH operations , services provided , and residents served. Findings indicate that various vulnerable groups reside in UCHs; some UCHs offer unsafe living environments; and some residents are reportedly abused , neglected , and financially exploited. Regulations , policies and practices that might influence UCH prevalence are discussed.
