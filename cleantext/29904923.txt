  A plasma membrane receptor protein kinase , FERONIA ( FER) , regulates various aspects of plant reproductive and vegetative growth. In roots , binding of a peptide ligand to FER causes rapid suppression of cell elongation whereas in ovules , FER is involved in gametophyte interactions. Here , we examined the effect of a mutation that eliminates kinase activity , on both ovule fertilization and root growth , using the same batch of seeds containing a kinase-dead mutation. The kinase-dead mutation of FER reduced the ability to complement fer-4 knockout phenotypes , compared with wild-type sequence in root , but not in ovules. Our results support a model in which cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms , such as different interacting partners and/or downstream signaling events , lead to cell type-specific functions of FER.
