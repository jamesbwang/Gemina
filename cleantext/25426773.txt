  Brain radiation is associated with functional deficits in children. The purpose of this study was to examine white matter integrity as measured by diffusion tensor imaging and associations with region-specific radiation dose and neuropsychological functioning in children treated with cranial irradiation. A total of 20 patients and 55 age- and sex-matched controls were included in the present study. Diffusion tensor imaging and neuropsychological assessments were conducted at baseline and 6 , 15 , and 27 months after treatment. The neuropsychological assessment included motor dexterity , working memory , and processing speed. White matter regions were contoured , and the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) and fractional anisotropy ( FA) were recorded for each participant. Linear mixed effects regression models were used to prospectively compare the associations among ADC , FA , radiation dose to contoured structures , and performance on the neuropsychological assessments over time. The mean prescription dose was 44 Gy ( range 12-54). Across visits , compared with the controls , the patients showed a significantly increased ADC across all selected regions and alterations in FA in the dorsal midbrain and corpus callosum ( genu , splenium , body). An increased radiation dose to the genu and body of the corpus callosum was associated with alterations in ADC and FA and reduced neuropsychological performance , most notably motor speed and processing. These prospective data suggest that subcortical white matter , especially the genu and body of the corpus callosum , could be regions with increased susceptibility to radiation-induced injury , with implications for cognitive function.
