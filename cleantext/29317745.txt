  Favorable effects of sauna bathing on cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated. Hot water bathing is an alternative , and could also have similar effects. Information pertaining to hot water bathing frequency and water temperature was obtained from 873 subjects. Carotid mean and max intima-media thickness ( IMT) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity ( baPWV) were measured as indices of atherosclerosis. Central haemodynamics were evaluated using radial pulse waveform analyses. Plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP) were measured as an index for cardiac loading. The mean duration of a single hot bath was 12.4 ± 9.9 min. Subject bathing in hot water ≥ 5 times per week had significantly lower baPWV , central pulse pressure ( PP) , and BNP after correcting for possible confounding parameters. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that hot water temperature was negatively associated with baPWV , while bathing frequency was negatively related to central PP and BNP. A longitudinal follow-up in 164 subjects showed that hot water bathing ≥ 5 times per week was associated with significantly lower increase in BNP over time , while the temperature of the water tended to be related to lower increases in carotid max IMT and baPWV. Hot water bathing showed a favorable effect on atherosclerotic and central haemodynamic parameters.
