  Insect metamorphosis has been a classic model to understand the role of hormones in growth and timing of developmental transitions. In addition to hormones , transitions in some species are regulated by genetic programs , such as the heterochronic gene network discovered in C. elegans<pathogen>. However , the functional link between hormones and heterochronic genes is not clear. The heterochronic gene lin-28 is involved in the maintenance of stem cells , growth and developmental timing in vertebrates. In this work , we used gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments to study the role of Lin-28 in larval growth and the timing of metamorphosis of Drosophila melanogaster. During the late third instar stage , Lin-28 is mainly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system and in the intestine. Loss-of-function lin-28 mutant larvae are smaller and the larval-to-pupal transition is accelerated. This faster transition correlates with increased levels of ecdysone direct target genes such as Broad-Complex ( BR-C) and Ecdysone Receptor ( EcR). Overexpression of Lin-28 does not affect the timing of pupariation but most animals are not able to eclose , suggesting defects in metamorphosis. Overexpression of human Lin-28 results in delayed pupariation and the death of animals during metamorphosis. Altogether , these results suggest that Lin-28 is involved in the control of growth during larval development and in the timing and progression of metamorphosis.
