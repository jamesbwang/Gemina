  Antibiotic resistance and , accordingly , their pollution because of uncontrolled usage has emerged as a serious problem in recent years. Hence , there is an increased demand to develop robust , easy , and sensitive methods for rapid evaluation of antibiotics and their residues. Among different analytical methods , the aptamer-based biosensors ( aptasensors) have attracted considerable attention because of good selectivity , specificity , and sensitivity. This review gives an overview about recently-developed aptasensors for antibiotic detection. The use of various aptamer assays to determine different groups of antibiotics , like Î²-lactams , aminoglycosides , anthracyclines , chloramphenicol , ( fluoro) quinolones , lincosamide , tetracyclines , and sulfonamides are presented in this paper.
