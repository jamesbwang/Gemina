  Extracellular electron transfer ( EET) from electrochemically active bacteria ( EAB) plays a critical role in renewable bioelectricity harvesting through microbial fuel cells ( MFC). Comprehensive interpretation and interrogation of EET mechanisms can provide valuable information to enhance MFC performance , which however are still restricted by the intrinsic complexity of natural biofilm. Here , we design core/shell EAB-encapsulating cables as a one-dimensional model system to facilitate EET studies , where the local microenvironments can be rationally controlled to establish structure-function correlations with full biological relevance. In particular , our proof-of-concept studies with Shewanella<pathogen> loihica PV-4 ( S. loihica) encapsulating cables demonstrate the precise modulation of fiber diameters ( from 6.9 ± 1.1 to 25.1 ± 2.4 μm) and bacteria interactions , which are found to play important roles in programming the formation of different intercellular structures as revealed by in situ optical and ex situ electron microscopic studies. As-formed bacterial cables exhibit conductivity in the range of 2.5-16.2 mS · cm
