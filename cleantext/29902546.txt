  Although many dermatologic surgeons are aware of the risks of surgical smoke , many do not employ hazard reduction strategies. To identify the infectious , inhalational , chemical , and mutagenic risks of surgical smoke in dermatologic procedures and suggest evidence based hazard reduction strategies. A review of articles indexed for MEDLINE on PubMed using keywords `` surgical smoke '' , `` dermatology '' , `` surgical mask '' , `` respirator '' , `` smoke evacuator '' , and `` guidelines '' was performed in 13 combinations using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA) protocols. This review includes data from 45 manuscripts from the dermatology , surgery , infectious<disease> disease<disease> , obstetrics , and cancer biology literature. There are risks associated with surgical smoke , and although some dermatologists are aware of these risks , many are not using hazard reduction strategies such as smoke evacuators and surgical masks. Most of the data regarding surgical smoke hazards and methods for smoke safety is derived from in vitro and non-human in vivo studies , in addition to resources outside of the dermatology literature. Standardized guidelines for surgical smoke safety should be implemented in the dermatology community and residency curriculum.
