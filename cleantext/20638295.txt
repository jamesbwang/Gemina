  Patients with late-life depression<symptom> may be at the preclinical stage of dementia. However , the neurodegenerative processes in late-life depression<symptom> are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the distribution patterns of amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration in a depressive population without dementia. The study recruited 63 middle-aged and elderly patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD) and 22 control subjects. The MDD patients were further subdivided into those with mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) ( n = 24) and non-MCI ( n = 39) patients. We used the global standardized uptake value ratio of Most of the control subjects ( 81.8 %) were biomarker-negative , in contrast to the MCI MDD patients ( 37.5 %). A relatively high proportion of the MCI MDD patients ( 12.5 %) exhibited both amyloid positivity and hippocampal atrophy as compared to the control subjects ( 4.5 %) and non-MCI patients ( 5.1 %). However , a considerable proportion of the MCI MDD patients ( 29.2 %) were categorized into the group with hippocampal atrophy alone , and negative amyloid deposition , as compared to the control subjects ( 0 %) and non-MCI patients ( 5.1 %). This study highlights the expected heterogeneity of the processes of neurodegeneration in MDD patients. The diverse neurodegenerative processes may have important etiologic and therapeutic implications regarding neurodegenerative pathophysiology in late-life
