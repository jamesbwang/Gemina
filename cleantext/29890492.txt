  A hydroxyl radical ( OH) ballast water treatment system ( BWTS) was developed and applied to inactivate entrained organisms in a 10,000-ton oceanic ship , where OH was produced by a strong ionization discharge combined with a water jet cavitation effect. The calculated OH generation rate was 1373.4 Î¼M min
