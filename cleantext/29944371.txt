  Hormones of the neurotrophin family , nerve growth factor ( NGF) , brain derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) , neurotrophin 3 ( NT3) , and neurotrophin 4 ( NT4) , are known to activate the family of Tropomyosin receptor kinases ( TrkA , TrkB , and TrkC). Moreover , inhibition of the TrkA kinase pathway in pain has been clinically validated by the NGF antibody tanezumab , leading to significant interest in the development of small molecule inhibitors of TrkA. Furthermore , Trk inhibitors having an acceptable safety profile will require minimal brain availability. Herein , we discuss the discovery of two potent , selective , peripherally restricted , efficacious , and well-tolerated series of pan-Trk inhibitors which successfully delivered three candidate quality compounds 10b , 13b , and 19. All three compounds are predicted to possess low metabolic clearance in human that does not proceed via aldehyde oxidase-catalyzed reactions , thus addressing the potential clearance prediction liability associated with our current pan-Trk development candidate PF-06273340.
