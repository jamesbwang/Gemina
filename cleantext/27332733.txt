  Chemotherapy resistance and relapse remain significant sources of mortality for children and adults with acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). Further intensification of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy is likely not feasible due to the severity of acute and long-term side effects upon normal tissues commonly induced by these drugs. Successful development and implementation of new precision medicine treatment approaches for patients with AML , which may improve leukemia<disease> remission and diminish toxicity , is thus a major priority. Tumor antigen-redirected chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T-cell immunotherapies have induced remarkable responses in patients with relapsed or chemorefractory B-lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> , and similar strategies are now under early clinical study in adults with relapsed/refractory AML. However , potential on target/off tumor toxicity of AML CAR T-cell immunotherapies , notably aplasia of normal myeloid cells , may limit broader implementation of such approaches. Careful selection of optimal target antigens , consideration of toxicity mitigation strategies , and development of methodologies to circumvent potential CAR T-cell resistance are essential for successful implementation of cellular immunotherapies for patients with high-risk AML.
