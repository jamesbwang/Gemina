  To better identify the distinctive characteristics of space representation in the radial dimension , we have proposed a new paradigm: the landmarks alignment task where two parallel aluminum bars were radially presented. Children had to move a landmark along one bar and place it at the same location as the reference landmark placed by the examiner on the parallel bar. The major interest of this task was its capacity to assess space representation in the radial dimension when considering a spatial landmark that oriented the subject 's attention toward the orthogonal dimension. The most important result showed that in the radial dimension children with dyslexia exhibited a forward bias on the left bar , meaning a mental underrepresentation of the leftward peripersonal space and/or a mental overrepresentation of the rightward peripersonal space. Furthermore , reading discrepancies were correlated with radial forward bias on the left bar. The experiment was also conducted in the lateral axis , showing a pseudoneglect behavior in children without dyslexia. Our landmarks alignment task had the advantage of being able to assess space representation in a complex environment. The forward radial representational bias in children with dyslexia could have implications for spatial orientation in peripersonal workspace in school situations.
