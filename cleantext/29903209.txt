  To establish a high performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous determination of caffeine , benzoic acid , sorbic acid , acesulfame potassium , saccharin sodium and sodium cyclamate in drink. The sample was extracted by ASPEC using extraction column ( Pro Elut C _ ( 18) 500 mg/6 m L) , dried by Turbo<pathogen> VapⅡ and dissolved in mobile phase. The supernatant was separated on Agilent SB-C _ ( 18) column ( 2. 1 mm × 50 mm , 1. 8 μm) using 0. 02 mmol/L ammonium acetate/methyle alcohol as mobile phase and then detected by HPLC-MS/MS using multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM) in positive ionization and negative ionization mode. The average recoveries were from 72. 6 % to 100. 5 % and the relative standard deviations ( RSD) were from 0. 3 % to 3. 1 % ( n = 6). The calibration curves showed a good linearity with correlation coefficients r > 0. 9990. The linear range for saccharin sodium was 8-800 μg/L and others were 2-200 μg/L. The detection limits for caffeine , benzoic acid , sorbic acid , acesulfame potassium and sodium cyclamate were 0. 001 mg/kg and 0. 004 mg/kg for saccharin sodium. The method is specific , sensitive , easy , fast and suitable for the confirmation and quantification of caffeine , benzoic acid , sorbic acid , acesulfame potassium , saccharinsodium and sodium cyclamate in drink.
