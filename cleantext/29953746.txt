  Mohs micrographic surgery ( MMS) is the treatment of choice for high-risk primary basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) and recurrent BCC of the head and neck , showing fewer recurrences compared with surgical excision ( SE). The objectives of this study were to determine the recurrence rate of head and neck BCC after MMS and to develop a prediction model with significant risk factors for recurrence. A retrospective study of patient records. All BCCs treated with MMS between 1 January 1995 and 1 July 2013 at the University Medical Center Groningen ( UMCG) were selected retrospectively. Recorded parameters were patient characteristics , tumour size , tumour location , histopathological subtype , previous treatment , the number of stages until microscopic clearance , defect size , adverse events , follow-up time and recurrence after MMS. The study covered 1021 MMS operations conducted on primary BCCs ( 57.4 %) , residual BCCs ( 25.6 %) and recurrent BCCs ( 17.0 %). The median follow-up time was 54.0 months ( ranging from 1 to 221 months). The 5-year cumulative probability of recurrence was 3.3 %: 2.6 % for primary BCCs , 5.4 % for residual BCCs and 2.9 % for recurrent BCCs. An aggressive histopathological subtype , residual BCCs and recurrent BCCs were significant risk factors for predicting a higher risk of recurrence after MMS. This large-scale retrospective study showed low recurrence rates after MMS for primary and recurrent BCCs. Residual BCCs treated with MMS had relatively higher recurrence rates. The risk of recurrence for MMS-treated residual aggressive BCCs was more than four times higher than that for primary non-aggressive BCCs.
