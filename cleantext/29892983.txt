  Utilization of group transfer polymerization for the synthesis of poly ( diethyl vinylphosphonate) ( PDEVP) allows its controlled end-group functionalization. Thus , a new fluorescent chromophore/PDEVP conjugate is prepared and subjected to biocompatibility tests on two different human cell lines. In contrast to the previous studies , the tagged polymer is not absorbed by cells from the solution and has nearly no impact on cell mortality rate.
