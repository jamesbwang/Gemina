  The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the presence of hip osteoarthritis at the time of hip fracture increases treatment failure rates when using either a sliding hip screw ( SHS) or proximal femoral nail ( PFN) for fracture fixation. A retrospective study of a consecutive series of 455 women and 148 men ( median age , 83.8 years) treated with SHS or PFN was performed. Osteoarthritis was evaluated based on pre-operative radiographs using the Kellgren and Lawrence grading system. Treatment failure , which was defined as non-union , avascular necrosis<symptom> , backing out of the implant , cut out of the proximal screws , peri-prosthetic fracture , implant breakage , or conversion to hemi- or total hip arthroplasty , was evaluated for a follow-up period of four to seven years. Optimal placement of the implant ( tip-apex distance ( TAD) and 3-point fixation) and the effects of age , sex , the quality of reduction , implant type , fracture stability , fracture type , and time to failure were considered confounders of the relationship between failure and osteoarthritis ( OA). Among the 32 cases ( 5.3 %) of treatment failure , 12 ( 2 %) showed evidence of osteoarthritis. After controlling for age , sex , the quality of reduction , implant type , fracture stability , fracture type , and TAD , osteoarthritis was associated a greater than threefold increase in treatment failure compared with that of patients without pre-operative evidence of osteoarthritis ( OR , 3.26; 95 % CI , 1.4-7.65; P = 0.006). After adjusting for potential confounding factors , radiographic evidence of hip osteoarthritis at the time of hip fracture increases the incidence of treatment failure.
