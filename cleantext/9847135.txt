  In the late stage of anthocyanin biosynthesis , dihydroflavonol reductase ( DFR) and anthocyanidin synthase ( ANS) mediate a formal tautomerization. However , such oxidation/reduction process requires high energy and appears to be unnecessary , as the oxidation state does not change during the transformation. Thus , a non-enzymatic pathway of tautomerization has also been proposed. To resolve the long-standing issue of whether this non-enzymatic pathway is the main contributor for the biosynthesis , we carried out density functional theory ( DFT) calculations to examine this non-enzymatic pathway from dihydroflavonol to anthocyanidin. We show here that the activation barriers for the proposed non-enzymatic tautomerization are too high to enable the reaction to proceed under normal aqueous conditions in plants. The calculations also explain the experimentally observed requirement for acidic conditions during the final step of conversion of 2-flaven-3,4-diol to anthocyanidin; a thermodynamically and kinetically favorable concerted pathway can operate under these conditions.
