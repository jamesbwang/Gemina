  The aim was to determine the effect of various initiators on the thermal changes that occur during incisions performed in soft tissues using a diode laser. There are no studies that have assessed the effect of various initiators on the thermal changes that occur during incisions performed in soft tissues using a diode laser. Thermal changes were observed during standardized incisions in chicken breast ( without skin) via thermoelements over a 10-sec irradiation period. Incisions were created using a 975 nm diode laser with a 320 μ fiber tip diameter. Incisions ( 10 in each group) were performed with and without an initiator ( control group). Red/blue articulating paper , cork , and SureStep At 3 and 6 W without any initiator , the mean temperature increased by 5.7 °C versus 12.4 °C , respectively. Cork initiator at 3 and 6 W resulted in temperature increase by 4.88 °C versus 6.21 °C , respectively. Incisions made using the blue/red articulating paper-initiated tip resulted in temperature increase by 2.9/ 5.8 °C versus 8.2/ 7.6 °C at 3 and 6 W power settings , respectively. Initiation with SureStep resulted in temperature increase by 2.3 °C and at 6 W by 4.1 °C. No significant differences were recorded between the different groups , but higher temperatures were associated with higher power settings. The power settings of the diode laser and type of initiator used , both effect the degree to which the temperature of the soft tissue increases during incisions and have to be considered for the safety in soft tissue applications.
