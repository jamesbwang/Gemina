  Exposure of the suture after transscleral suture fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lenses is a known late complication that typically requires intervention. Patch grafts of sclera<symptom> , cornea , or pericardium have been described. We describe a novel autologous scleral flap to cover an exposed 10-0 polypropylene suture. This technique requires no exogenous graft material and avoids the risks of intraocular manipulation of the lens. Every effort should be made to avoid external exposure of the suture , but in cases that develop suture erosion , an autologous scleral flap may be a useful intervention.
