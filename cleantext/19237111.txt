  This study examined motor competence ( MC) behavior in 6- to 14-year-old children , and investigated the differences in health-related fitness ( HRF) between high and low MC groups , according to sex and age. A sample of 564 children ( 288 males) participated in this study , divided into three age groups ( 6 ⁻ 8 years; 9 ⁻ 11 years ; 12 ⁻ 14 years). Total MC and its three components ( stability , locomotor , and manipulative) were assessed with a quantitative instrument. HRF was evaluated using a maximal multistage 20-m shuttle-run test and the handgrip test. Participants were divided into tertiles according to their MC level and high and low MC groups were analyzed. Overall , MC increased across age groups for both sexes , but boys presented better results than girls. The high MC group outperformed their low MC peers in all HRF variables , independent of their age group. Although cardiovascular fitness increased with age for both the high and low MC groups , the differences between these groups were greater in older children compared to younger children , within the study age range. The findings suggest that MC interventions should be considered as an important strategy to enhance HRF , and girls at a young age should be a priority target.
