  This Letter describes a novel metamaterial design by employing off-resonance and in-resonance excitation for a high-transmission terahertz-wave quarter-wave plate ( QWP). The device is demonstrated with a thin film metamaterial with double-layer split ring resonators ( SRRs). Different from a usual resonant metamaterial device , here we design the work frequency off from the inductor-capacitor ( LC) resonance for the TE mode , while in a dipole resonance for the TM mode to obtain the artificial birefringence. Rectangular SRRs in this Letter provide a choice to optimize the off-resonance and in-resonance excitation , to assist the double-layer design for high transmission. Converting a linearly polarized wave to circular polarization with our QWP , the experiment confirms a transmittance of 0.8 and an ellipticity of 0.99 at 0.98 THz. The developed thin film device is flexible and has a thickness of 48 Î¼m ( sub-wavelength). This is an advantage for potential integration in systems where overall device compactness is required.
