  The precise role and value of incorporating nanoforms in biologically active matrices for medical applications is not known. In our current work , we incorporate two chitin nanoforms ( i.e. , nanocrystals or nanofibers) into Genipin-chitosan crosslinked matrices. These materials were studied as 2D films and 3D porous scaffolds to assess their potential as primary support and guidance for stem cells in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. The incorporation of either nanoforms in these 2D and 3D materials reveals significantly better swelling properties and robust mechanical performance in contrast to nanoform-free chitosan matrices. Furthermore , our data shows that these materials , in particular , incorporation of low concentration chitin nanoforms provide specific topological cues to guide the survival , adhesion , and proliferation of human adipose-derived stem cells. These findings demonstrate the potential of Genipin-chitosan crosslinked matrices impregnated with chitin nanoforms as value added materials for stem cell-based biomedical applications.
