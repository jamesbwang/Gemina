  Trans-eQTLs have been implicated in complex traits and common diseases , but many were initially identified on the basis of having an effect in cis , and there has been no assessment of the significance of the overlap in relation to chance expectations. Here , we investigated whether trans-expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL) associations identified in whole blood contribute to variance in complex traits by determining ( 1) whether genome-wide significant ( GWS) single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) were enriched for trans-eQTL ( including trans-only eQTL) , and ( 2) whether the genomic regions surrounding associated trans-genes were enriched for statistical associations in the relevant GWAS. On average for a given phenotype , we identify 4.8 % of GWS SNPs overlapping with trans-eQTL present in blood , and show that for the majority of these phenotypes , this observation does not exceed that expected by chance. Likewise , we observe no enrichment for genetic associations with the GWAS phenotype in the regions surrounding the linked trans-genes , with the exception of rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. Interestingly , the GWS SNPs for each phenotype were consistently more enriched for unique trans-eQTL SNPs than trans-eQTL SNP-probe pairs ( p = 4 Ã— 10
