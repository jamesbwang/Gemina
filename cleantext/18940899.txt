  Morphological characterization of leg arteries is of significant importance to detect vascular remodeling triggered by atherosclerotic changes. We determined reference values of vessel diameters and assessed prevalence of stenosis and arterial variations of the lower limb arteries in a healthy male population sample. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography at 1.5 Tesla was performed in 756 male participants ( median age = 52 years , range = 21-82 years) of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania. Vessel diameters were measured in 9 predefined segments of the pelvic and leg arteries and 95th percentiles were used for upper reference values of means of left and right side arteries. Reference values of vascular diameters decreased from proximal to distal arteries: common iliac = 1.18 cm; internal iliac = 0.75 cm; external iliac = 1.03 cm; proximal femoral = 1.02 cm; distal femoral = 0.77 cm; popliteal = 0.69 cm; anterior tibial = 0.42 cm; posterior tibial = 0.38 cm; fibular = 0.40 cm. Body-surface area indexed reference values increased with age in all segments. A number of 53 subjects ( 7.0 %) had at least one stenosis , mainly in the lower leg arteries anterior tibial ( n = 28 , 3.7 %) , posterior tibial ( n = 18 , 2.4 %) and fibular ( n = 20 , 2.6 %). The risk of stenosis increased considerably with age ( odds ratio = 1.08; p < 0.001). The most common arterial variant was type I-A in both legs ( n = 620 , 82 %). We present reference values for different pelvic and leg artery segment diameters in men that decrease from proximal to distal and increase with age. Stenoses were most prevalent in lower leg arteries and type I-A was the most common variant in the lower leg.
