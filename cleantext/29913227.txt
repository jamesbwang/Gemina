  Bright light ( BL) not only regulates human emotion and circadian physiology but can also directly modulate emotional memories. Impaired fear extinction and enhanced fear acquisition and consolidation are hallmarks of fear-circuitry disorders; thus , we tested whether BL facilitates fear extinction and inhibits fear acquisition. We randomly exposed 29 healthy humans to high- ( 9000 lx) or low-intensity light ( < 500 lx) for 15 min , near the nadir of the phase response to light , in a single-blind manner. Simultaneously with the light exposure , subjects performed fear extinction training and second fear acquisition , where a visual conditioned stimulus ( CS) , previously paired with an electric shock<symptom> unconditioned stimulus ( US) , was presented without the US , while another CS was newly paired with the US. Conditioned responses ( CRs) and changes in prefrontal cortex ( PFC) activity were determined during encoding and delayed recall sessions. BL-exposed subjects exhibited lower extinction-related PFC activity and marginally higher acquisition-related PFC activity during light exposure than subjects exposed to control light. Twenty-four hours later , BL reduced CRs to both the extinguished and non-extinguished CSs with marginally lower extinction-related PFC activation , suggesting that BL enhanced fear extinction , while suppressing fear acquisition. Further , BL sustained tolerance to fear re-conditioning. Our results demonstrate that a single and brief BL exposure , synchronized with fear extinction and acquisition , instantaneously influences prefrontal hemodynamic responses and alleviates fear expression after 24 h. Although the specificity of BL effects deems further investigation , our findings indicate the clinical relevance of adjunctive BL intervention in exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for fear-circuitry disorders.
