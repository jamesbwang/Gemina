  To evaluate the effects of adding Vibrotactile feedback ( VTF) in myoelectric prosthesis users during performance of a functional task when visual feedback is disturbed. A repeated-measures design with a counter-balanced order of three conditions. Laboratory setting. Transradial amputees using a myoelectric prosthesis with normal or corrected eyesight ( N = 12 , median age 65 Â± 13 years). Exclusion criteria were orthopaedic or neurologic problems. All subjects performed the Modified Box & Blocks test , grasping and manipulating 16 blocks over a partition using their myoelectric prosthesis. This was performed three times: In full light , in a dark room without VTF , and in a dark room with VTF. Performance time , i.e. the time needed to transfer one block , and accuracy during performance , measured by number of empty grips , empty transitions with no block and block drops from the hand. Significant differences were found in all outcome measures when VTF was added , with improved performance time ( 4.2 versus 5.3 seconds) and a reduced number of grasping errors ( 3.0 versus 6.5 empty grips; 1.5 versus 4 empty transitions; 2.0 versus 4.5 block drops). Adding VTF to myoelectric prosthesis users has positive effects on performance time and accuracy when visual feedback is disturbed.
