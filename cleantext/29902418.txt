  Propofol and remifentanil are 2 useful drugs used in induced hypotensive anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of these drugs on intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , transfusion requirements , and hemodynamic status during standardized orthognathic surgical procedures. In this double-blind randomized clinical trial , 50 consecutive healthy patients with Class III skeletal deformity were candidates for bimaxillary orthognathic surgery at Qaem Hospital , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences ( Mashhad , Iran) , from November 2016 until December 2017. These patients were randomly assigned to 2 equal-number groups to receive hypotensive anesthesia with propofol or remifentanil. Neither the surgeon nor the patients were aware of the study groups , whereas both the student and anesthesiologist were not blinded. Age and gender were recorded , and mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , mean arterial pressure , and mean heart rate , as well as duration of surgery and duration of general anesthesia , were monitored intraoperatively. The hypotensive anesthetic drugs were the primary predictor variables and the mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> volume was the main outcome in this research. The independent t test and χ In this study , 25 patients with a mean age of 22.25 ± 3.31 years were investigated in each group. The mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> volume was 578.26 ± 95.14 mL and 366.67 ± 64.92 mL in the propofol and remifentanil groups , respectively. The independent-samples t test showed that mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was significantly lower in the remifentanil group than in the propofol group ( P = .001). Furthermore , the mean arterial blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was significantly lower in the remifentanil group than in the propofol group ( 85 ± 20 mm Hg vs 95 ± 15 mm Hg , P < .001). Hypotensive anesthesia with remifentanil , in comparison with propofol , significantly reduces mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> during orthognathic surgery , which decreases the transfusion requirements and disadvantages of transfusion and
