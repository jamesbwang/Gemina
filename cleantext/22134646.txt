  Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA) gene is widely used to survey microbial communities. Specialized 16S rRNA databases have been developed to support this approach including Greengenes , RDP and SILVA. Most taxonomy annotations in these databases are predictions from sequence rather than authoritative assignments based on studies of type strains or isolates. In this work , I investigated the taxonomy annotations and guide trees provided by these databases. Using a blinded test , I estimated that the annotation error rate of the RDP database is ∼ 10 %. The branching orders of the Greengenes and SILVA guide trees were found to disagree at comparable rates with each other and with taxonomy annotations according to the training set ( authoritative reference) provided by RDP , indicating that the trees have comparable quality. Pervasive conflicts between tree branching order and type strain taxonomies strongly suggest that the guide trees are unreliable guides to phylogeny. I found 249,490 identical sequences with conflicting annotations in SILVA v128 and Greengenes v13 .5 at ranks up to phylum ( 7,804 conflicts) , indicating that the annotation error rate in these databases is ∼ 17 %.
