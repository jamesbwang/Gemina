  Accessing the data points in the crystal structure landscape of a molecule is a challenging task , either experimentally or computationally. We have charted the crystal structure landscape of 4-bromocinnamic acid ( 4BCA) experimentally and computationally: experimental doping is achieved with 4-methylcinnamic acid ( 4MCA) to obtain new crystal structures; computational doping is performed with 4-chlorocinnamic acid ( 4CCA) as a model system , because of the difficulties associated in parameterizing the Br atom. The landscape of 4CCA is explored experimentally in turn , also by doping it with 4MCA , and is found to bear a close resemblance to the landscape of 4BCA , justifying the ready miscibility of these two halogenated cinnamic acids to form solid solutions without any change in crystal structure. In effect , 4MCA , 4CCA and 4BCA form a commutable group of crystal structures , which may be realized experimentally or computationally , and constitute the landscape. Unlike the results obtained by Kitaigorodskii , all but two of the multiple solid solutions obtained in the methyl-doping experiments take structures that are different from the hitherto observed crystal forms of the parent compounds. Even granted that the latter might be inherently polymorphic , this unusual observation provokes the suggestion that solid solution formation may be used to probe the crystal structure landscape. The influence of π ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ π interactions , weak hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds in directing the formation of these new structures is also seen.
