  Since it was first postulated by Wigglesworth in 1934 , juvenile hormone ( JH) is considered a status quo hormone in insects because it prevents metamorphosis that is initiated by the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone ( 20E). During the last decade , significant advances have been made regarding JH signaling. First , the bHLH-PAS transcription factor Met/Gce was identified as the JH intracellular receptor. In the presence of JH , with the assistance of Hsp83 , and through physical association with a bHLH-PAS transcriptional co-activator , Met/Gce enters the nucleus and binds to E-box-like motifs in promoter regions of JH primary-response genes for inducing gene expression. Second , the zinc finger transcription factor Kr-h1 was identified as the anti-metamorphic factor which transduces JH signaling. Via Kr-h1 binding sites , Kr-h1 represses expression of 20E primary-response genes ( i.e. Br , E93 and E75) to prevent 20E-induced metamorphosis. Third , through the intracellular signaling , JH promotes different aspects of female reproduction. Nevertheless , this action varies greatly from species to species. Last , a hypothetical JH membrane receptor has been predicted to be either a GPCR or a tyrosine kinase receptor. In future , it will be a great challenge to understand how the JH intracellular receptor Met/Gce and the yet unidentified JH membrane receptor coordinate to regulate metamorphosis and reproduction in insects.
