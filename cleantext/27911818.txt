  Uterine glands are essential for pregnancy establishment. By employing forkhead box A2 ( FOXA2)- deficient mouse models coupled with leukemia<disease> inhibitory factor ( LIF) repletion , we reveal definitive roles of uterine glands in embryo implantation and stromal cell decidualization. Here we report that LIF from the uterine glands initiates embryo-uterine communication , leading to embryo attachment and stromal cell decidualization. Detailed histological and molecular analyses discovered that implantation crypt formation does not involve uterine glands , but removal of the luminal epithelium is delayed and subsequent decidualization fails in LIF-replaced glandless but not gland-containing FOXA2-deficient mice. Adverse ripple effects of those dysregulated events in the glandless uterus result in embryo resorption and pregnancy failure. These studies provide evidence that uterine glands synchronize embryo-endometrial interactions , coordinate on-time embryo implantation , and impact stromal cell decidualization , thereby ensuring embryo viability , placental growth , and pregnancy success.
