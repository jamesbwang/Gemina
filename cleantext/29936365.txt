  The aim of this study was to evaluate the modulatory effect of S-allyl cysteine against cyclophosphamide-induced changes in uroplakin IIIa , CCL11 and TNF-α. Mice were treated with cyclophosphamide ( 200 mg/kg × 7 d , ip). S-allyl cysteine ( 150 mg/kg × 7d , ip) , and comparator compound mesna ( 40 mg/kg × 7d , ip) were administered 1 h before and 4 h after each cyclophosphamide dose. The urinary bladder was analysed for mRNA and protein changes in uroplakin IIIa , CCL11 and TNF-α and histopathological findings. Cyclophosphamide caused hemorrhagic cystitis<disease> formation and downregulation of UPIIIa. These changes were accompanied by upregulation of CCL11 and TNF-α. S-allyl cysteine attenuated these changes including protection at histological level. Mesna which was used as a comparator drug also showed protection. However , relatively S-allyl cysteine showed a stronger protective effect than mesna. These findings highlight a correlation between downregulaion of UPIIIa and enhanced production of inflammatory biomarkers and protective effects of S-allyl cysteine which has been reported to be a potent uroprotective agent. The present study strengthens its role which could be clinically exploited in chemotherapy regimen.
