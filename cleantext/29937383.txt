  Transradial percutaneous coronary intervention ( TR-PCI) has been increasingly popular over the last decade in the US. Previous studies have shown that same-day ( SD) discharge after elective PCI is as safe as overnight ( ON) observation. Our study was performed to assess the clinical and financial impact of early discharge in patients undergoing TR-PCI. This is a single center registry of patients undergoing elective TR-PCI. Timing of discharge was determined by the treating physician. ( Groups: Same Day Discharge- SD-; Overnight Stay- ON-). Demographic data , procedural characteristics and adverse outcomes were recorded. Outcomes included 30 day-MACE and procedure- related complications , as well as total operative costs in patients from both groups. Propensity score matching for patient demographics , coronary symptoms and procedure indicators was used to compare both groups. The entire cohort included 852 patients ( 429 in SD group and 423 in ON group) and the propensity score matched groups of 245 patients in the SD group and 245 patients in the ON group. The two groups had no significant baseline clinical differences , and had similar clinical outcomes. Specifically , no significant difference was noted in procedural complications ( 3.7 % vs 2.5 % , p = 0.43) , re-hospitalization ( 4.1 % vs 4.1 % , p = 0.92) , re-intervention ( 2.5 % vs 2.1 % , p = 0.77) , myocardial infarction ( 0 % vs 0.08 % , p = 0.15) , stroke ( 0 % vs 0 % , p = 1.0) and all-cause mortality ( 0 % vs 0 % , p = 1.0). SD Group patients had a significant lower procedure-related cost compared to overnight stay patients ( $ 3,346.45 vs $ 4,681.99 , p < 0.0001) and lower 30-day post procedure-associated cumulative costs/total operating costs ( $ 4,493.22 vs $ 7,112.21 , p < 0.0001). In elective patients undergoing low risk TR-PCI , same-day discharge seems to be a safe and feasible clinical practice , with significant potential savings to the US healthcare system.
