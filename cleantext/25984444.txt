  Test a method of identifying , recruiting and collecting data from children and adolescents who consult their general practitioner about a musculoskeletal condition. Prospective cohort feasibility study. 13 general practices in West Midlands of England. Patients aged 8-19 years who consult their general practice about a musculoskeletal condition. Patients were identified via a relevant musculoskeletal Read code entered at the point of consultation. Feasibility was assessed in terms of From October 2016 to February 2017 , an eligible musculoskeletal Read code was entered on 343 occasions , 202 patients were excluded ( declined , n = 153; screened not suitable , n = 49) at the point of consultation. The remaining 141 patients were mailed an invitation to participate ( 41.1 %); 46 patients responded to the invitation ( response rate: 32.6 %) , of which 27 patients consented ( consent rate: 19.1 %). Participants mean age was 13.7 years ( SD 2.7) and current pain intensity was 2.8 ( SD 2.7). All participants completed the 6-week follow-up questionnaire. All participants found the interview questions to be acceptable and would consider participating in a similar study in the future. The majority of general practitioners/nurse practitioners , and all of the research nurses reported to be adequately informed about the study and found the study processes acceptable. The expected number of participants were identified and invited , but consent rate was low ( < 20 %) indicating that this method is not feasible ( eg , for use in a large prospective study). Recruiting children and adolescents with musculoskeletal conditions in a primary care setting currently presents a challenge for researchers. Further work is needed to identify alternative ways to conduct studies in this population in order to address the current knowledge gap in this field.
