  Cleaner shrimp<disease> and their reef fish clients are an interspecific mutualistic interaction that is thought to be mediated by signals , and a useful system for studying the dynamics of interspecific signalling. To demonstrate signalling , one must show that purported signals at minimum ( a) result in a consistent state change in the receiver and ( b) contain reliable information about the sender 's intrinsic state or future behaviour. Additionally , signals must be perceptible by receivers. Here , we document fundamental attributes of the signalling system between the cleaner
