  Coronary artery vasospasm ( CS) can be identified as either a diffuse type or focal type; however , the difference in endothelial characteristics between these spasm types remains unclear. The features of coronary intima associated with diffuse spasm and focal spasm using coronary angioscopy ( CAS) were evaluated and the optical coherence tomography ( OCT) findings were compared. CAS and/or OCT observational analysis was performed in 55 patients ( mean age: 61.4 years , 31 men) who had acetylcholine-provoked CS ( diffuse CS , 31 patients; focal CS , 24 patients). The yellowness of the intima , presence of thrombus in CAS , and intimal characteristics based on the OCT results were evaluated. CAS showed more atherosclerotic yellow plaques at the focal spasm segment than at the diffuse spasm segment ( p = 0.032). Moreover , there were more thrombi at the focal spasm segment ( p = 0.039). In addition , OCT results revealed that the intima area , maximum intima thickness , and lipid content in the focal CS group were larger than the diffuse CS group ( 4.22 Â± 1.67 mm These results indicate that the presence of atherosclerotic plaques at the spasm site is likely to be related to the occurrence of a focal vasospasm. This may support the difference of features between focal CS and diffuse CS and contribute to precise treatment for each spasm type.
