  Traffic safety essentially depends on the drivers ' alertness and vigilance , especially in monotonous or demanding driving situations. Brain oscillatory EEG activity offers insight into a drivers ' mental state and has therefore attracted much attention in the past. However , EEG measures do not only vary with internal factors like attentional engagement and vigilance but might also interact with external factors like time on task , task demands , or the degree to which a traffic situation is predictable. In order to identify EEG parameters for cognitive mechanisms involved in tasks of high and low controllability , the present study investigated the interaction of time on task , task load , and cognitive controllability in simulated driving scenarios , using an either re-active or pro-active driving task. Participants performed a lane-keeping task , half of them compensating varying levels of crosswind ( re-active task) , and the other half driving along a winding road ( pro-active task). Both driving tasks were adjusted with respect to difficulty. The analysis of oscillatory EEG parameters showed an increase in total power ( 1-30 Hz) with time on task , with decreasing task load , and in the re-active compared to the pro-active task. Furthermore , the relative power in Alpha band increased with decreasing task load and time on task , while relative Theta power showed the opposite pattern. Moreover , relative Alpha power was also higher in the re-active , than pro-active , driving situation , an effect that even increased with time on task. The results demonstrate that the controllability of a driving situation has a similar effect on oscillatory EEG activity like time on task and task load.
