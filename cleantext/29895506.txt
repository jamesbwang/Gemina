  Tributyltin ( TBT) is as an antifouling organotin compound used in boat paints. Although organotin-based antifouling agents have been banned on a global scale , the mode of action of TBT has been studied in numerous aquatic species because of its toxicity , persistence , bioaccumulation potential , and endocrine-disrupting characteristics. In this study , we conducted 96-h acute toxicity tests wherein we exposed juvenile and adult marine mysids to waterborne TBT. Over 4 weeks of exposure , mortality was dose-dependently increased in juveniles and adult mysids. To test sublethal effects of TBT on juvenile development , newborn juvenile mysids were exposed to 1 , 5 , or 10 ng L
