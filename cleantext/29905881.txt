  Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) occurs de novo or intensifies after sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG). Endoscopic radiofrequency ( Stretta) is a minimally invasive , effective tool to treat GERD. However , Stretta safety and efficacy are unknown in patients with GERD after LSG. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Stretta treatment post-LSG GERD , quality of life , and PPI dose up to 6 months. A retrospective review of all patients ' data who underwent Stretta procedure in our center. Demographics , pre-Stretta lower esophageal manometry , 24-h pH monitoring , endoscopic and radiological findings , GERD symptoms using Quality of Life ( HR-QoL) questionnaire , and PPI doses at 0 , 3 , and 6 months were reviewed. Fifteen patients had an initial BMI of 44.4 Â± 9 kg/m Stretta did not improve GERD symptoms in patients post-LSG at short-term follow-up , and about 6.7 % complication rate was reported. Patients were not satisfied despite the decrease in PPI dose.
