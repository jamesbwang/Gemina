  There is a need to better prepare radiation therapy ( RT) providers to safely operate within the health information technology ( IT) sociotechnical system. Simulation-based training has been preemptively used to yield meaningful improvements during providers ' interactions with health IT , including RT settings. Therefore , on the basis of the available literature and our experience , we propose principles for the effective design and use of simulated scenarios and describe a conceptual framework for a debriefing approach to foster successful training that is focused on safety mindfulness during RT professionals ' interactions with health IT.
