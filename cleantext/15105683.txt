  Traumatic nucleus pulposus sequestration ( TNPS) usually occurs concurrently with severe destruction of bone. TNPS combined with a slight thoracolumbar flexion- distraction fracture , triggering a disastrous nerve injury , has rarely been reported. Due to the atypical radiologic manifestations , such a patient can easily be overlooked. Hereby , we present a TNPS patient as well as a slight thoracolumbar flexion-distraction fracture and serious neurologic symptoms. T12 spinous process fracture , L1 flexion distraction fracture , thoracolumbar traumatic nucleus pulposuse sequestration and lower limbs incomplete paralysis INTERVENTIONS:: To avoid further neurologic compromise , an urgent laminectomy and exploration of the spinal canal was performed. After decompression OR and 4 months rehabilitation , the patient 's neurologic function improved remarkably. A slight flexion-distraction fracture following injury is liable to eclipse the concurrence of TPNS. For this patient , a high-resolution MRI was needed to make a definitive diagnosis and guide surgery. Once TPNS has been diagnosed , sufficient decompression and discectomy surgery should be performed without delay.
