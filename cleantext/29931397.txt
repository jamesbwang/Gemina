  The nearly complete genome sequence of a novel polyomavirus<pathogen> from blood samples of Akodon montensis and Calomys<pathogen> tener collected in Brazil was determined by high-throughput sequencing. This virus showed a typical polyomaviruses genome organization , and it was classified as a member of the genus Betapolyomavirus. Our results expand the host range and viral diversity of the family Polyomaviridae.
