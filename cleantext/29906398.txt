  The effect of light on the Ca2 + binding to mycelia and cell walls isolated from aerial mycelia of three strains of Trichoderma<pathogen> spp. was studied. Measurements of the total Ca2 + content in mycelium , and Ca2 + bound to cell walls isolated from aerial mycelium by two independent methods showed that the light-induced formation and maturation of conidia in Trichoderma spp. is accompanied by an increased Ca2 + deposition in mycelia and cell walls. Moreover , the cultivation of T. atroviride F-534 in the presence of 45Ca2 + under circadian illumination showed that radioactivity was exclusively localized in the light-induced conidial rings of aerial mycelium. The fluorescence microscopy of chlortetracycline-stained mycelia showed that the major fraction of Ca2 + was accumulated in conidia and fructification structures , or some intracellular compartments in T. atroviride F-534 grown under circadian illumination , while only a limited amount of Ca2 + was associated with hyphal surfaces. In addition , the study of 45Ca2 + binding on cell walls revealed that T. atroviride F-534 displays both increased 45Ca2 + binding capacity and elevated affinity to 45Ca2 + binding upon illumination. The results indicate that conidia formation and/or maturation is associated with changes in Ca2 + homeostasis.
