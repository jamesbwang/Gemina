  Colloidal inorganic nanoparticles have wide applications in the detection of analytes and in biological assays. A large number of these assays rely on the ability of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs , in the 20 nm diameter size range) to undergo a color<symptom> change<symptom> from red to blue upon aggregation. AuNP assays can be based on cross-linking , non-cross linking or unmodified charge-based aggregation. Nucleic acid-based probes , monoclonal antibodies , and molecular-affinity agents can be attached by covalent or non-covalent means. Surface plasmon resonance and SERS techniques can be utilized. Silver NPs also have attractive optical properties ( higher extinction coefficient). Combinations of AuNPs and AgNPs in nanocomposites can have additional advantages. Magnetic NPs and ZnO , TiO
