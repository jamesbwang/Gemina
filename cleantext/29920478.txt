  <br> Background: The effectiveness of current Tumor , Lymph node , Metastases ( TNM) staging system in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors ( SiNETs) is unsatisfactory. Current N classification only distinguishes between node-negative and node-positive status. We aim to refine the N classification for updated TNM stage. Patients with non-metastatic SiNETs between 1988 and 2012 were enrolled in the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER) database. Using the X-tile program , we calculated an optimal cut-off value for lymph node ratio ( LNR) and proposed a novel Nr category. Survival outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. Adjusted hazard ratio and cluster analysis were performed to differentiate TNrM stages. Patients with existing TNM stage I and II had equivalent survival prognosis ( P = 0.214). Current N classification was not a significant predictor of patient survival ( P = 0.372). Multivariate analyses identified the revised Nr classification , based on LNR of 0.6 optimal cut-off value , as an independent prognostic factor ( P = 0.020). By incorporating the Nr classification , a revised TNrM which categorized patients into three new stage was proposed: stage I ( T1-2Nr0-1) , stage II ( T3Nr0-1) and stage III ( TxNr2 or T4Nrx). TNrM stage had better stratification according to the survival outcome ( primary cohort: stage I: reference , II: HR 3.852 95 ％ CI 1.731-8.575; III HR 7.169 95 ％ CI 3.220-15.963 , P < 0.001; validation cohort: stage I: reference , II: HR 2.034; III: HR 3.815; P < 0.001). The Nr classification more accurately stratifies SiNET patients than current N classification. The new TNrM staging system could improve the ability to predict survival outcome of SiNET patients. <br>.
