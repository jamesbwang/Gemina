  The anti-cancer efficacy of methionine γ-lyase ( MGL) from Clostridium<pathogen> sporogenes<pathogen> ( C.<pathogen> sporogenes<pathogen>) is described. MGL was active against cancer models in vitro and in vivo. The calculated EC50 values for MGL were 4.4 U/ml for A549 , 7.5 U/ml for SK-BR3 , 2.4 U/ml for SKOV3 , and 0.4 U/ml for MCF7 cells. The combination of doxorubicin ( DOX) and MGL was more effective for A549 human lung cancer growth inhibition than either agent alone in vitro and in vivo. MGL reduced the EC50 of doxorubicin from 35.9 μg/mL to 0.01-0.265 μg/mL. The growth inhibitory effect of DOX + MGL on A549 xenografts in vivo was reflective of the results obtained in vitro. The inhibition rate of tumor growth in the combined arm was 57 % , significantly higher than that in the doxorubicin ( p = 0.033)- alone arm.
