  There are few data describing associations between dietary patterns and bone microarchitecture. This study investigated the relationship between diet quality and HRpQCT and pQCT measures in older adults. Data were available for 184 men and 166 women. Dietary data were collected at baseline ( 1998-2003) using an administered food frequency questionnaire. A ` prudent ' diet score ( PDS) was identified using principal component analysis and used as an indicator of dietary quality. HRpQCT and pQCT images were acquired at follow-up in 2012 , from the non-dominant distal radius and tibia using Scanco XtremeCT and Stratec XCT2000 instrument scanners , respectively. The mean ( SD) PDS was- 0.24 ( 1.23) for men and 0.62 ( 1.14) for women. In women , a significant positive relationship was found between baseline dietary pattern and total and trabecular area at both the radius and the tibia , measured by HRpQCT. Similar trends were observed with pQCT parameters. Positive associations were observed for tibia total area ( 38 % slice). At the radius , significant positive associations were found for total area ( 4 % slice) and polar strength strain index ( 33 % slice). All relationships remained robust to adjustment. For men , although patterns were similar , there were no significant associations for HRpQCT outcomes. Significant associations were observed for baseline PDS and polar strength strain and total area ( 66 % slice) at the radius , measured by pQCT. Our data suggest that diets high in fruit , vegetables , oily fish and whole grain cereals in early old age are associated with greater bone size but not volumetric bone density or microarchitecture in later life in women.
