  The FUT2 gene was considered as an important candidate for pathogenic infections , while the potential associations between this gene and the production and reproductive traits of pigs have not been explored. In this study , we detected the genetic variants of porcine FUT2 gene and analyzed the associations of the polymorphisms with FUT2 mRNA expression and production and reproductive traits ( age at 100 kg , backfat thickness at 100 kg , eye muscle thickness , the number of newborn piglets , the number of weaned piglets , and birth weight) in 100 Large White sows. One single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) ( rs345476947 , C â†’ T) in the intron of FUT2 and three genotypes ( TT , CT and CC) were determined. Association analysis revealed significant associations between this SNP with the number of newborn piglets and weaned piglets. Furthermore , individuals with the TT genotype had significantly higher numbers of newborn piglets and weaned piglets than those with the CC genotype ( P < 0.05). Quantitative PCR analysis showed that FUT2 expression in individuals with CC genotype was significantly higher than those with TT and CT genotypes in the liver and lymph<symptom> gland ( P < 0.05) and higher than that of CT in the spleen , kidney , and duodenum ( P < 0.05). These findings indicated that the TT genotype may be a favorable genotype for the reproductive traits of pigs. Our study revealed the genetic variants of the FUT2 gene and identified a promising candidate SNP ( rs345476947) associated with the reproductive traits , which has the potential to be applied in selective breeding of pigs.
