  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are important regulators of tumor formation , progression and metastasis. The present study characterized a novel miRNA ( miR) -888 , as a potent oncomiR in human colorectal cancer ( CRC). The clinicopathological investigation on 126 cases of CRC patients demonstrated that the expression level of miR-888 was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with adjacent healthy tissue , and was associated with tumor stage and histological differentiation. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test demonstrated that CRC patients with increased miR-888 expression exhibited a decreased overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS) compared with patients with low miR-888 expression. Further univariate and multivariate analyses identified miR-888 as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival outcome in CRC patients. To determine the biological role of miR-888 in human CRC ,
