  We conducted a randomized study to compare vaginal self-sampling with assisted sampling by medical personnel on the cervix for HPV testing in primary screening. The first aim was to determine if the HPV prevalence is independent of sampling location ( vagina versus cervix) and the person performing the sampling. The second aim was to evaluate if the two sampling strategies differed in the detection rate of CIN2 +. In total , 19,523 women were randomized into two groups , with 9926 invited to perform self-sampling ( SS arm) using the Rover VIBA-brush and 9597 offered assisted sampling using the cytobrush ( AS arm). All samples were applied to the indicating FTA elute card and analysed for high-risk HPV using the hpVIR real-time PCR assay. The outcome for the first aim was HPV prevalence and for the second aim the number of CIN2 + based on histology. In the SS arm , 52.7 % of invited women participated in the study , as compared to 34.2 % in the AS arm. All samples contained sufficient amount of nuclear DNA for a valid HPV result , with vaginal samples having a higher DNA amount than cervical samples ( p < 4.62 x10
