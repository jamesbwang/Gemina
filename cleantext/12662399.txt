  Taking into account the previously reported relationship between inflammation<symptom> and carcinogenesis , and the scant amount of data concerning the role of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs) in carcinogenesis , we decided to study the process of extracellular trap formation in patients with inflammation<symptom> as well as in patients with cancer occurring in the same location. For preliminary isolation of neutrophils ( PMNs) , we used Polymorphprep â„¢ , then sorted with Microbeads. The cells were recorded in the incubation chamber with a BD Pathway 855 microscope system. Flow cytometric data ( MPO + neutrophils) were acquired on FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Amounts of cfDNA were determined by Abcam 's Circulating DNA Quantification Kit. Neutrophils of patients with inflammation<symptom> and of subjects with stage I/II oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC) produce increased amounts of NETs , while stage III/IV OSCC were comparable with the control group. In all of the studied groups of cells stimulation with LPS and rhIL-17 produced more NETs in relation to unstimulated cells. Neutrophil supernatant of inflammation<symptom> patients and stage I/II cancer patients demonstrated the increased level of cfDNA , which decreased at stage III/IV. Patients with oral inflammations<symptom> showed an increased rate of MPO + neutrophils , which was lower than in stage I/II cancer patients and not significantly different than in Stage III/IV cancer patients and the control group. The direction of changes in NETs formation seems to be a new common element shared by inflammation<symptom> and early stage cancer. Changes in the formation of NETs observed in patients with advanced cancer , other than an early phase or inflammation<symptom> , indicate an alternative range of NETs involvement depending on different phases of this disease.
