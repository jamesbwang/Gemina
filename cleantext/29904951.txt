  Traditional magnifying glasses can give magnified virtual images with diffraction-limited resolution , that is , detailed information is lost. Here , a novel magnifying glass by transformation optics , referred to as a `` superresolution magnifying glass '' ( SMG) is designed , which can produce magnified virtual images with a predetermined magnification factor and resolve subwavelength details ( i.e. , light sources with subwavelength distances can be resolved). Based on theoretical calculations and reductions , a metallic plate structure to produce the reduced SMG in microwave frequencies , which gives good performance verified by both numerical simulations and experimental results , is proposed and realized. The function of SMG is to create a superresolution virtual image , unlike traditional superresolution imaging devices that create real images. The proposed SMG will create a new branch of superresolution imaging technology.
