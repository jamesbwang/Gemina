  To reach an evidence-based knowledge in the context of the temporal-spatial pattern of neuronal death and find appropriate time of intervention in order to preserve spared neurons and promote regeneration after traumatic spinal cord injury ( TSCI). The study design was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis ( PRISMA)- guided systematic review. PubMed and EMBASE were searched ( 24 October , 2015) with no temporal or linguistic restrictions. Hand-search was performed in the bibliographies of relevant articles. Non-interventional animal studies evaluating time-dependent neuronal death following acute mechanical trauma to the spinal cord were included. We separately evaluated the fate of various populations of neurons including propriospinal neurons , ventral motor neurons , Clarke 's column neurons , and supraspinal neurons. We found 11,557 non-duplicated studies. Screening through the titles and abstracts led to 549 articles , 49 of which met the inclusion criteria. Both necrotic and apoptotic neuronal deaths occur after TSCI , though necrosis<symptom> is the prominent mechanism. There are differences in the responses of intrinsic neurons of the spinal cord to the TSCI. Also , the extent of neuronal death in the supraspinal neurons depends on the anatomical location of their axons. In order to develop new therapies , selection of the injury model and time of intervention has a crucial role in the efficacy of therapy. In addition , examining the safety and efficacy of an intervention by reliable methods not confounded by the injury-related changes would promote translation of therapies to the clinical application.
