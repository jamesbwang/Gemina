  The concept of acute-on-chronic liver failure ( ACLF) covers acute deterioration of the liver function in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis ( ALC) caused by secondary or extra-hepatic provoking factors ( PF) leading to dysfunction of target organs. CLIF-C-ACLF score refers to the number of decompensated organs/systems and is recommended for predicting outcome in patients with ALC. Objective- to compare the diagnostic value of the Child-Pugh score and the CLIF-C-ACLF score for predicting short-term mortality in patients with ALC. The clinical data of 150 patients with ALC were retrospectively analyzed. Enrolled patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence/ absence of PF 3 months before the death: I group ( n = 83)- without PF ( CLF) , group II ( n = 67)- with PF ( ACLF). To assess the severity of ALC we used the Child-Pugh score and the CLIF-C-ACLF score. Infectious complications were considered as PF. The sensitivity of the STMP by Child-Pugh score in group 1 was 100 % ( 95 % CI 58.9-100) , specificity was 38.9 % ( 95 % CI 30.9-47.4). The sensitivity for the CLIF-C-ACLF score was 100 % ( 95 % CI 58.9-100) , specificity-93.75 % ( 95 % CI 88.5-97.1). A. The sensitivity of STMP by Child-Pugh score in group II was 100 % ( 95 % CI 54.1-100) , specificity was 29.5 % ( 95 % CI -42.6 to 18.5). The sensitivity of STMP by CLIF-C-ACLF in score II was 100 % ( 95 % CI 58.9-100) , specificity was 88.5 % ( 95 % CI 77.8-95.2). The CLIF-C-ACLF corresponded to the model of excellent quality in groups I ( 0.99) and II ( 0.97) and was higher than the Child-Pugh score in both groups ( p = 0.012 and p = 0.015 respectively). The diagnostic value of the CLIF-C-ACLF score for predicting short-term mortality in patients with ALC is higher than Child-Pugh , especially for acute decompensation of ALC caused by precipitating factors.
