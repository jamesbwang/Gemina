  Genetic variations in nucleotide excision repair genes can alter the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck ( SCCHN). The present study has genotyped 334 subjects from North Indian population for xeroderma pigmentosum complementation Group C ( XPC) rs2228001A > C , XPC rs77907221 polyadenylate ( PAT) deletion/insertion ( D/I) , xeroderma pigmentosum complementation Group D- rs13181A > C , and xeroderma pigmentosum complementation Type G rs17655 G > C polymorphisms with polymerase chain reaction ( PCR)- restriction-fragment length polymorphism or allele-specific PCR methods. Compared to D allele , I allele for XPC PAT D/I polymorphism was associated with significantly decreased the risk of SCCHN ( odds ratios = 0.67 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.48-0.94 , P = 0.03). Haplotype CI constituted from XPC polymorphisms was also associated with decreased risk of SCCHN ( P = 0.004). In contrast , haplotype Crohn 's disease significantly increased the risk for SCCHN ( P < 0.00). A significant early onset of SCCHN was observed in individuals with CC genotype for XPC A > C polymorphism ( P = 0.004). Our results suggest a possible risk modulation for SCCHN with XPC polymorphisms in North Indian population.
