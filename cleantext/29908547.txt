  Wheat is the most commonly grown cereal. Immunological reaction to wheat may be IgE or T-cell- mediated. Asthma could be induced by inhaled flour or by exposure to allergens present in bakery products. In patients with IgE-mediated allergy to wheat proteins there is no specific therapy , except oral immunotherapy ( OIT). There are few data regarding OIT with wheat protein in allergic patients. We present a case of a 32-yearold female patient , who worked for 5 years in wheat and bakery products industry , who developed an occupational asthma and chronic urticaria after flour inhalation or ingestion of foods that containit. The patient underwent wheat OIT , that was well-tolerated with no severe reaction during treatment. We may conclude that wheat OIT is a safe therapy and may induce symptoms improvement in allergic asthma and urticaria in patients with wheat allergy. Wheat OIT may induce tolerance to allergic patients.
