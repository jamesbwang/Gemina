  A need exists for pre-clinical large animal models of the spine to translate biomaterials capable of repairing intervertebral disc ( IVD) defects. This study characterized the effects of cervical spinal level , loading rate , injury and repair with genipin-crosslinked fibrin ( FibGen) on axial and torsional mechanics in an ovine cervical spine model. Cervical IVDs C2-C7 from nine animals were tested with cyclic tension-compression (- 240 to 100 N) and cyclic torsion ( ± 2 ° and ± 4 °) tests at three rates ( 0.1 , 1 and 2 Hz) in intact , injured and repaired conditions. Intact IVDs from upper cervical levels ( C2-C4) had significantly higher torque range and torsional stiffness and significantly lower axial range of motion ( ROM) and tensile compliance than IVDs from lower cervical levels ( C5-C7). A tenfold increase in loading rate significantly increased torque range and torsional stiffness 4-8 % ( depending on amplitude) ( p < 0.001). When normalized to intact , FibGen significantly restored torque range ( FibGen: 0.96 ± 0.14 , Injury: 0.88 ± 0.14 , p = 0.03) and axial ROM ( FibGen: 1.00 ± 0.05 , Injury: 1.04 ± 0.15 , p = 0.02) compared to Injury , with a values of 1 indicating full repair. Cervical spinal level must be considered for controlling biomechanical evaluations , and FibGen restored some torsional and axial biomechanical properties to intact levels.
