  Blood transfusion services are a vital and integral part of modern healthcare services. However , the risk of transfusion transmittable infections ( TTI) has been a major handicap. Therefore , this study was aimed at determining the prevalence of hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) , hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) , and human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) among blood donors. A retrospective study was conducted to collect data about the blood donors who consecutively donated blood from October 2011 to 2014. A three-year retrospective study was conducted in Mekelle Blood Bank. A data abstraction format was used to collect the sociodemographic and clinical data , and the prevalence of HBV , HCV<pathogen> , and HIV<pathogen> was determined. Data were analyzed using STATA version 10 analytical software. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant in all the analyses. A total of 10728 blood donors , median ( interquartile range) of age 30 ( 23-45) years and 3750 ( 34.9 %) males were enrolled in this study. Of the participants 407 ( 3.79 %) , 143 ( 1.33 %) , and 111 ( 1.03 %) blood donors were positive for HBV , HCV<pathogen> , and HIV<pathogen> , respectively. HBV-HIV coinfections were found 10 ( 1.93 %) blood donors , followed by HBV-HCV and HIV-HCV. A significant association between sex and marital status with HBV and HIV<pathogen> infection was found. However , significant association of HCV<pathogen> was observed among sex ( X
