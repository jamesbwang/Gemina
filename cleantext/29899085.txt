  LncRNAs are involved in many aspects of cellular processes , including antiviral immune response. To identify influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>)- related lncRNAs , we performed RNA-deep sequencing to compare the profiles of lncRNAs in A549 and 293T cells with or without IAV<pathogen> infection. We identified an IAV-upregulated lncRNA named lnc-ISG20 because it shares most of its sequence with ISG20. We found that lnc-ISG20 is an interferon-stimulated gene similar to ISG20. Overexpression of lnc-ISG20 inhibited IAV<pathogen> replication , while lnc-ISG20 knockdown favored viral replication , suggesting that ln-ISG20 is inhibitory to IAV<pathogen> replication. Further study indicated that overexpression of lnc-ISG20 enhances ISG20 protein levels , while knockdown of lnc-ISG20 reduced ISG20 protein levels in A549 cells induced with polyI: C and Sendai virus. We demonstrated that lnc-ISG20 inhibits IAV<pathogen> replication in an ISG20-dependent manner. As lnc-ISG20 did not affect the mRNA level of ISG20 , we postulated that lnc-ISG20 may function as competing endogenous RNA to ISG20 to enhance its translation. Indeed , we identified that miR-326 is a mutual miRNA for both ISG20 and lnc-ISG20 that targets the 3 ` UTR of ISG20 mRNA to inhibit its translation. We confirmed that lnc-ISG20 can bind miR-326 , which in turn decreased the amount of miR-326 bound to ISG20 mRNA. In conclusion , we identified that the IAV-upregulated lnc-ISG20 is a novel interferon-stimulating gene that elicits its inhibitory effect on IAV<pathogen> replication by enhancing ISG20 expression. We demonstrated that lnc-ISG20 functions as a ceRNA to bind miR-326 to reduce its inhibition on ISG20 translation. Our results revealed the mechanism by which lnc-ISG20 inhibits IAV<pathogen> replication.
