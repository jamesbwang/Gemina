  Emphasis has been placed on methods to enlarge monopolar radiofrequency ( RF) lesion<symptom> size for pain management. Ex vivo research has suggested that fluid modulation may be an effective method to enlarge lesion<symptom> zone. To date , these findings have not been confirmed in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of hypertonic saline on in vivo lesion<symptom> size through both histological and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) analysis. A secondary purpose was to validate in vivo characterization of RF lesions<symptom> using contrast-enhanced MRI. Monopolar RF was performed in an in vivo porcine model in 3 groups: ( 1) without fluid preinjection , ( 2) with preinjection of 1 % lidocaine , or ( 3) with preinjection of 1 % lidocaine and 8 % sodium chloride. Following lesioning , MRI processing with gadolinium-enhanced , T1-weighted imaging and histological analysis was performed. The addition of 8 % sodium chloride significantly increased the size of RF lesion<symptom> in comparison to the addition of 1 % lidocaine alone and to the absence of fluid injection , as assessed by histological and MRI analysis. Three distinct histological lesion<symptom> zones were identified. In comparison to the no-fluid group , the addition of hypertonic saline significantly altered the shape and histological composition of the lesion<symptom>. There was a significant correlation of lesion<symptom> volume as assessed by MRI and by histology measurements. Peak power and total energy delivery also correlated with lesion<symptom> size. This study validates the ability of hypertonic saline to increase in vivo RF lesion<symptom> size. With further refinement , MRI may be a viable method to assess RF lesion<symptom> size.
