  Advanced oxidation processes ( AOPs) that produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals are promising methods to destroy aqueous organic contaminants. Hydroxyl radicals react rapidly and nonselectively with organic contaminants and degrade them into intermediates and transformation byproducts. Past studies have indicated that peroxyl radical reactions are responsible for the formation of many intermediate radicals and transformation byproducts. However , complex peroxyl radical reactions that produce identical transformation products make it difficult to experimentally study the elementary reaction pathways and kinetics. In this study , we used ab initio quantum mechanical calculations to identify the thermodynamically preferable elementary reaction pathways of hydroxyl radical-induced acetone degradation by calculating the free energies of the reaction and predicting the corresponding reaction rate constants by calculating the free energies of activation. In addition , we solved the ordinary differential equations for each species participating in the elementary reactions to predict the concentration profiles for acetone and its transformation byproducts in an aqueous phase UV/hydrogen peroxide AOP. Our ab initio quantum mechanical calculations found an insignificant contribution of Russell reaction mechanisms of peroxyl radicals , but significant involvement of HO
