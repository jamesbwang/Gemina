  The aim of this study is to determine the impact of a motivational therapy ( MT) on the outcomes for individuals diagnosed with nocturnal enuresis ( NE). We enrolled 158 patients with NE referred to the Service of Pediatrics , Campus Bio-Medico University Hospital of Rome , from January 2013 to September 2017. Of these , 21 were excluded because they did n't meet the inclusion criteria. The study was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. A hundred and thirty seven enuretic patients ( 100 ( 72.9 %) male and 37 ( 27.1 %)) female patients with a median age of 8.8 years were included in the study. The patients were assigned to receive pharmacological therapy with desmopressin ( dDAVP) ( G1) ( n = 51) , MT ( G2) ( n = 33) and both of them ( G3) ( n = 53). The three groups were homogeneous , with no significant differences in gender , age and family history of NE. In G1 , 30/51 ( 58.82 %) children achieved response vs. 1/33 ( 3.0 %) children in G2 vs. 35/53 ( 66.04 %) children in G3. About these results , The differences between G2 vs. G1 ( p < 0.01) and vs. G3 ( p < 0.01) were statistically significant while the difference between G1 vs G3 was not statistically significant ( p = 0.45). Our study underlines the importance of MT in the management of NE and highlights the safety of treatment and the positive effect of MT on the compliance and the adherence to pharmacological therapy. Considering the importance of the impact of such evidence on children 's lifestyle , we expect that further study with a larger sample size may confirm our hypothesis.
