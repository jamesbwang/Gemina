  Low levels of endosulfan are known to stimulate mast cells to release allergic mediators , while imidacloprid can inhibit IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation. However , little information about the effects of both pesticides together on mast cell degranulation is available. To measure the effects , IgE-activated mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells ( BMMCs) were treated with imidacloprid and endosulfan , individually , and simultaneously at equi-molar concentrations in tenfold steps ranging from 10
