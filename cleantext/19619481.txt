  The diffusion dynamics in the cellular plasma membrane provide crucial insights into molecular interactions , organization , and bioactivity. Beam-scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy combined with super-resolution stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy ( scanning STED-FCS) measures such dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. It reveals nanoscale diffusion characteristics by measuring the molecular diffusion in conventional confocal mode and super-resolved STED mode sequentially for each pixel along the scanned line. However , to directly link the spatial and the temporal information , a method that simultaneously measures the diffusion in confocal and STED modes is needed. Here , to overcome this problem , we establish an advanced STED-FCS measurement method , line interleaved excitation scanning STED-FCS ( LIESS-FCS) , that discloses the molecular diffusion modes at different spatial positions with a single measurement. It relies on fast beam-scanning along a line with alternating laser illumination that yields , for each pixel , the apparent diffusion coefficients for two different observation spot sizes ( conventional confocal and super-resolved STED). We demonstrate the potential of the LIESS-FCS approach with simulations and experiments on lipid diffusion in model and live cell plasma membranes<symptom>. We also apply LIESS-FCS to investigate the spatiotemporal organization of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in the plasma membrane of live cells , which , interestingly , show multiple diffusion modes at different spatial positions.
