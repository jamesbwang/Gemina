  The femoropoliteal segment is a common target for endovascular intervention and the unique biomechanical forces on the arteries increase the risk of restenosis This large meta-analysis supports drug coated balloons as the initial endovascular strategy due to lower risk of target lesion<symptom> revascularization compared to other modalities Whether there are subgroups of patients or lesion<symptom> types that benefit from an alternative revascularization approach is unclear and warrants investigation.
