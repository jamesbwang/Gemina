  Evidence about the anti-inflammatory properties of antipsychotics has grown. However , no previous studies have compared the immunomodulatory effect of risperidone and aripiprazole. The main aim of the present work is to compare the anti-inflammatory effect of risperidone and aripiprazole on a large array of serum cytokines at 3 months following the onset of treatment. This is a prospective , randomized , open-label study. Patients were randomly assigned to risperidone or aripiprazole. From this randomization , 75 patients and 75 healthy volunteers that matched with the selected patients were picked for entry in this study. Serum concentrations of 21 cytokines/chemokines were measured at baseline and 3 months following the initiation of antipsychotic medication. Those patients who were randomly assigned to risperidone had higher levels of IL-8 ( p = 0.000) and MIP-1β ( p = 0.007) than healthy volunteers at baseline , whereas no differences were found between patients initially assigned to aripiprazole and healthy volunteers. Three months following the onset of medication several cytokines decreased significantly: IL-8 , MIP-1β , Fractalkine , TNF-α , IL-7 , IL-13 , IL-17α , IL-23 , IL-21 ( all ps < 0.01). No differences were found in the percentages of change between both treatments. The effect size of the two antipsychotics was similar , except for TNF-α , IL-13 , IL-17α and Fractalkine , in which aripiprazole seems to have a greater effect size than risperidone , whereas risperidone seems to have a greater effect size than aripiprazole on MIP-1β. This is the first study that has compared the immunomodulatory effect of risperidone and aripiprazole , finding that the anti-inflammatory effect of both treatments was similar.
