  Atrioventricular Septal Defect ( AVSD) is a rare congenital heart defect ( CHD) often associated with genetic syndromes<disease> , most commonly Down syndrome<disease> ( DS). Over the last four decades , surgical repair has increased survival and improved quality of life in these patients. The prevalence of bradyarrhythmias namely , atrioventricular block ( AVB) and sinus node dysfunction ( SND) in AVSD is partially known. 522 cases with both partial and complete AVSD ( 38.7 % with DS) , undergoing intracardiac repair from 1982 to 2016 at our institution , were reviewed from our system database. 38 ( 7.3 %) patients received permanent PM implantation for AVB ( early or late) or SND. On one hand , AVB requiring PM was found in 26 ( 4.98 %). This was further subdivided into early-onset 14 ( 2.6 %) and late-onset AVB 12 ( 2.2 %) ( median 4 ( IQR 1-7) years). On the other hand , 12 ( 2.3 %) experienced late SND requiring PM ( median 11 ( IQR 3.5-15.2) years). Early and late AVB were independent from the type of AVSD ( partial or complete) , whereas the late SND was remarkably observed in complete AVSD compared to partial AVSD ( p = 0.017). We classified the cohort into two main categories: DS ( 202 , 38.7 %) and non-DS ( 320 , 61.3 %). At Kaplan-Meier survival analysis , DS was significantly associated with late-onset bradyarrhythmias ( p = 0.024). At Cox regression analysis , we identified DS as an independent predictor of PM implantation ( HR 2.17). In conclusion , about 7 % of repaired AVSD patients need PM implantation during follow-up. There are no differences in early and late AVB occurrence according to the type of AVSD. There is a higher incidence of late SND in repaired complete AVSD , with a later timing onset in patients with associated DS. Moreover , DS seems to be an independent predictor of PM implantation.
