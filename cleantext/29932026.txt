  The development of materials , chemistry and genetics have created a great number of systems for delivering antibiotics , neuropeptides or other drugs to neurons in neuroscience research , and have also provided important and powerful tools in neuron-related applications. Although these drug delivery systems can facilitate the advancement of neuroscience studies , there are still limited applications due to various drawbacks , such as difficulty in controlling delivery molecules or drugs to the target region , and trouble of releasing them in predictable manners. The combination of optics and drug delivery systems has potential to address these issues and deliver molecules or drugs to the nervous system with extraordinary spatiotemporal selectivity triggered by light. In this review , we will introduce the development of photo-triggered drug delivery systems in neuroscience research and their neuron-related applications including regulating neural activities , treating neural diseases and nerve regenerations.
