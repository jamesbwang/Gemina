  Despite the common use of non-fasting measurements for lipid profile in children it remains unclear as to the extent non-fasting conditions have on laboratory results of lipids measurements. We aimed to assess the impact of non-fasting lipid profile on the occurrence of dyslipidemia in children. Basic lipid profile including: total cholesterol ( TC) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) and triglycerides ( TG) , as well as small , dense-LDL-C ( sd-LDL-C) , apolipoprotein AI ( ApoAI) , apolipoprotein B ( ApoB) and lipoprotein ( a) ( Lp ( a)) , were measured in 289 presumably healthy children aged 9-11 in both fasting and non-fasting condition. The clinical impact of non-fasting lipid profile was evaluated individually for each child with estimation of false positive ( FP) and false negative ( FN) results. The highest percentage of FP results in non-fasting condition was observed for TG ( 42.3 %) being significantly higher when compared to FN results ( p = 0.003). In contrast , the highest percentage of FN results in a non-fasting state were shown for LDL-C ( 14.3 %) , but the difference was statistically insignificant when compared to FP results. When comparing fasting and non-fasting lipid profile a number of significant differences was shown for: TG ( p < 0.001) , HDL-C ( p = 0.002) LDL-C ( p < 0.001) and ApoAI ( p < 0.001) , respectively. The occurrence of dyslipidemia , recognized on the basis of non-fasting lipids was significantly higher ( p = 0.010) when compared to fasting lipid profile. A higher occurrence of dyslipidemia , based on the measurement of non-fasting lipids in children , is suggestive of possible disorders in lipid metabolism. However , accurate identification of dyslipidemia by assessment of non-fasting lipids requires the establishment of appropriate cut-off values for children.
