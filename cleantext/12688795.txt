  Polydioxirane ( PDOX) was prepared by the treatment of polysalicylaldehyde with Oxone and was found as a selective , highly efficient and heterogeneous reagent for epoxidation of alkenes which can be successfully isolated. This work also introduced a simpler , safer and milder way for epoxidation of alkenes with dioxirane groups than before. PDOX can be simply recovered from the reaction mixture by plain filtration and reused for eight runs without significant reactivity loss.
