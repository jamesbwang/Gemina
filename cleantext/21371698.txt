  Traditional methods of computed tomographic angiography ( CTA) can be unreliable in detecting carotid artery pseudo-occlusions or in accurately locating the site of carotid artery occlusion. With these methods , lack of adequate distal runoff due to pseudo-occlusion or intracranial occlusion can result in the inaccurate diagnoses of complete occlusion or cervical carotid occlusion , respectively. The site of carotid occlusion has important therapeutic and interventional considerations. We present several cases in which 4D CTA was utilized to accurately and noninvasively diagnose carotid pseudo-occlusion and intracranial internal carotid artery ( ICA) occlusion. We identified five patients who presented to our institute with ischemic stroke symptoms and evaluated images from traditional CTA protocols and 4D CTA protocols in each of these patients , comparing diagnoses rendered by each imaging technique. In two patients , traditional CTA suggested the presence of complete ICA occlusion. However , 4D CTA demonstrated pseudo-occlusion. Similarly , in three patients , traditional CTA demonstrated cervical ICA occlusion , whereas the 4D CTA demonstrated intracranial ICA occlusion. 4D CTA may be a more effective noninvasive imaging technique than traditional CTA to detect intracranial carotid artery occlusions and carotid artery pseudo-occlusions. Accurate , rapid , and noninvasive diagnosis of carotid artery lesions<symptom> may help tailor and expedite endovascular intervention.
