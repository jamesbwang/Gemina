  To conduct an overview to summarize the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia. A literature search was performed in PubMed , the Cochrane Library , LILACS , and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination , for articles published until March 31 , 2017. We included systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy , and/or the safety of aripiprazole , for patients with schizophrenia. Two authors independently performed the study selection , data extraction , and quality assessment. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ( GRADE) approach and the Risk of Bias in Systematic Review ( ROBIS) tool were used to appraise the quality of evidence and the risk of bias in the reviews , respectively. Fourteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Aripiprazole showed efficacy similar to that of both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs ( except olanzapine and amisulpride). Aripiprazole caused significantly lower weight gain and alterations in glucose and cholesterol levels , as compared to clozapine , risperidone , and olanzapine. In addition , aripiprazole caused significantly fewer general extrapyramidal side effects , less use of antiparkinsonian drugs , and akathisia , compared with typical antipsychotic drugs and risperidone. The overall quality of evidence in the reviews ranged from `` very low '' to `` moderate , '' principally because of the risk of bias of original trials , inconsistency , and imprecision in the outcomes. According to the ROBIS tool , there are four reviews with `` high '' risk of bias and five with `` unclear '' risk of bias. Aripiprazole exhibited efficacy similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs and a better safety profile than that of typical ( i.e. , less some extrapyramidal side effects) and atypical ( i.e. , less metabolic changes) antipsychotic drugs.
