  Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) from human peripheral blood provides a convenient and low-invasive way to obtain patient-specific iPSCs. The episomal vector is one of the best approaches for reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotent status because of its simplicity and affordability. However , the efficiency of episomal vector reprogramming of adult peripheral blood cells is relatively low compared with cord blood and bone<disease> marrow cells. In the present study , integration-free human iPSCs derived from peripheral blood were established via episomal technology. We optimized mononuclear cell isolation and cultivation , episomal vector promoters , and a combination of transcriptional factors to improve reprogramming efficiency. Here , we improved the generation efficiency of integration-free iPSCs from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by optimizing the method of isolating mononuclear cells from peripheral blood , by modifying the integration of culture medium , and by adjusting the duration of culture time and the combination of different episomal vectors. With this optimized protocol , a valuable asset for banking patient-specific iPSCs has been established.
