  To assess the feasibility of ultra-low dose computed tomography colonography ( CTC) using knowledge-based iterative reconstruction ( IR) and to determine its effect on polyp detection. Forty-nine prospectively-enrolled patients underwent ultra-low dose CTC in the supine ( 100 kVp/20 mAs) and prone positions ( 80 kVp/20 mAs) , followed by same-day colonoscopy. Thereafter , images were reconstructed using filtered back projection ( FBP) and knowledge-based IR ( IMR; Philips Healthcare , Best , Netherlands) algorithms. Effective radiation dose of CTC was recorded. Pooled per-polyp sensitivity and positive predictive value of three radiologists was analysed and compared between FBP and IMR. Image quality was assessed on a five-point scale and image noise was recorded using standard deviations. Mean effective radiation dose of ultra-low dose CTC was 0.90 ± 0.06 mSv. Eighty-nine polyps were detected on colonoscopy ( mean , 8.5 ± 4.7 mm). The pooled per-polyp sensitivity for polyps 6.0-9.9 mm ( n = 22) on CTC reconstructed with IMR ( 36/66 , 54.5 %) was not significantly different with that using FBP algorithm ( 34/66 , 51.5 %) ( p = 0.414). For polyps ≥ 10 mm ( n = 35) , however , the pooled per-polyp sensitivity on CTC with IMR ( 73/105 , 69.5 %) was significantly higher than that with FBP ( 55/105 , 52.4 %) ( p < 0.001). In particular , the difference of per-polyp sensitivity was statistically significant in intermediate ( p = 0.014) and novice ( p = 0.003) reviewers. Furthermore , mean image noise of IMR ( 8.4 ± 6.2 HU) was significantly lower than that of FBP ( 37.5 ± 13.9 HU) ( p < 0.001) and image quality with IMR was significantly better than with FBP in all evaluated segments in all reviewers ( all ps < 0.001). Sub-mSv CTC reconstructed with IMR was feasible for the detection of clinically significant polyps , demonstrating 70 % per-polyp sensitivity of polyps ≥ 10 mm , while allowing significant noise reduction and improvement in image quality compared with FBP reconstruction. • Sub-mSv CTC using IMR demonstrated 70 % per-polyp sensitivity for polyps ≥ 10 mm. • CTC using IMR significantly outperformed CTC reconstructed with FBP. • IMR allows significantly more noise reduction and improvement in image quality than FBP.
