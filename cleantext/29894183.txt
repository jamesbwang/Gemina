  We present an implementation of range separated functionals utilizing the Slater function on grids in real space in the projector augmented waves method. The screened Poisson equation is solved to evaluate the necessary screened exchange integrals on Cartesian grids. The implementation is verified against existing literature and applied to the description of charge transfer excitations. We find very slow convergence for calculations within linear response time-dependent density functional theory and unoccupied orbitals of the canonical Fock operator. Convergence can be severely improved by using Huzinaga 's virtual orbitals instead. This combination furthermore enables an accurate determination of long-range charge transfer excitations by means of ground-state calculations.
