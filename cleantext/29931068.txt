  Activated vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D deficiency might contribute to subclinical interstitial lung disease ( ILD). We examined associations between serum 25 ( OH) D concentrations and subclinical ILD among middle-aged to older adults who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. We studied 6302 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( MESA) participants who had baseline serum 25 ( OH) D concentrations and computed tomography ( CT) imaging spanning ≤ 10 y. Baseline cardiac CT scans ( 2000-2002) included partial lung fields. Some participants had follow-up cardiac CT scans at exams 2-5 and a full-lung CT scan at exam 5 ( 2010-2012) , with a mean ± SD of 2.1 ± 1.0 scans. Subclinical ILD was defined quantitatively as high-attenuation areas ( HAAs) between -600 and -250 Hounsfield units. We assessed associations of 25 ( OH) D with adjusted HAA volumes and HAA progression. We also examined associations between baseline 25 ( OH) D and the presence of interstitial lung abnormalities ( ILAs) assessed qualitatively ( yes or no) from full-lung CT scans at exam 5. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics , lifestyle factors ( including smoking) , and lung volumes. The cohort 's mean ± SD characteristics were 62.2 ± 10 y for age , 25.8 ± 10.9 ng/mL for 25 ( OH) D concentrations , and 28.3 ± 5.4 for body mass index ( kg/m2); 53 % were women , with 39 % white , 27 % black , 22 % Hispanic , and 12 % Chinese race/ethnicities. Thirty-three percent had replete ( ≥ 30 ng/mL) , 35 % intermediate ( 20 to < 30 ng/mL) , and 32 % deficient ( < 20 ng/mL) 25 ( OH) D concentrations. Compared with those with replete concentrations , participants with 25 ( OH) D deficiency had greater adjusted HAA volume at baseline ( 2.7 cm3; 95 % CI: 0.9 , 4.5 cm3) and increased progression over a median of 4.3 y of follow-up ( 2.7 cm3; 95 % CI: 0.9 , 4.4 cm3) ( P < 0.05). 25 ( OH) D deficiency was also associated with increased prevalence of ILAs 10 y later ( OR: 1.5; 95 % CI: 1.1 , 2.2). Vitamin D deficiency is independently associated with subclinical ILD and its progression , based on both increased HAAs and ILAs , in a community-based population. Further studies are needed to examine whether vitamin D repletion can prevent ILD or slow its progression. The MESA cohort design is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00005487.
