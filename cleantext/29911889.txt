  Invasive mold diseases ( IMDs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Approved treatments include voriconazole ( VORI) , liposomal amphotericin B ( L-AMB) , posaconazole ( POSA) and isavuconazole ( ISAV). A UK-based economic model was developed to explore the cost of treating IMDs with ISAV versus L-AMB followed by POSA. As indirect comparisons have demonstrated similar efficacy between the comparators , a cost-minimization approach was taken. Drug acquisition , administration & monitoring , and hospitalization costs were evaluated from the healthcare system perspective. Per-patient costs were UK # 14,842 with ISAV versus UK # 18,612 with L-AMB followed by POSA. Savings were driven by drug acquisition , and administration & monitoring costs. ISAV has the potential to reduce IMD treatment costs relative to L-AMB followed by POSA.
