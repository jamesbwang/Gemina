  Psychosis is associated with abnormal structural changes in the brain including decreased regional brain volumes and abnormal brain morphology. However , the underlying causes of these structural abnormalities are less understood. The immune system , including microglial activation , has been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychosis. Although previous studies have suggested a connection between peripheral proinflammatory cytokines and structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia , no in-vivo studies have investigated whether microglial activation is also linked to brain structure alterations previously observed in schizophrenia and its putative prodrome. In this study , we investigated the link between mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein ( TSPO) and structural brain characteristics ( i.e. regional brain volume , cortical thickness , and hippocampal shape) in key brain regions such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of a large group of participants ( N = 90) including individuals at clinical high risk ( CHR) for psychosis , first-episode psychosis ( mostly antipsychotic-na√Øve) patients , and healthy volunteers. The participants underwent structural brain MRI scan and (
