  Cytokines are soluble factors that mediate cell-cell communications in multicellular organisms. Recently , another system of cell-cell communication was discovered , which is mediated by extracellular vesicles ( EVs). Here , we demonstrate that these two systems are not strictly separated , as many cytokines in vitro , ex vivo , and in vivo are released in EV-encapsulated forms and are capable of eliciting biological effects upon contact with sensitive cells. Association with EVs is not necessarily a property of a particular cytokine but rather of a biological system and can be changed upon system activation. EV-encapsulated cytokines were not detected by standard cytokine assays. Deciphering the regulatory mechanisms of EV-encapsulation will lead to a better understanding of cell-cell communications in health and disease.
