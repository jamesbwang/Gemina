  We report on the instabilities in the Freedericksz state of the twist-bend nematic ( NTB) liquid crystal 1 '' ,7 ''- bis ( 4-cyanobiphenyl-4 '- yl) heptane ( CB7CB). The quasi homeotropic NTB state , into which a planar ( untwisted or 90 Â°- twisted) nematic CB7CB layer transits under a strong electric field , is found to be unstable despite the material being dielectrically positive. Close to the NTB melting point , destabilization occurs through the formation of metastable toric focal conic domains ( TFCDs) that , in time , transform into parabolic focal conic domains ( PFCDs) with the confocal parabolae in vertical planes through the layer normal. This transformation occurs by a novel process of continued dissociation of TFCDs. We outline how the extended Volterra process could help in a general appreciation of focal conic defects in the NTB phase. At relatively lower temperatures , stripes develop competingly with TFCDs. Identifiable as oily streaks , they are both localized and polarity sensitive; they form close to the substrates; and in low frequency square wave fields , they get suppressed at the cathode and augmented at the anode at each polarity switch. The study also dwells on the N-NTB-N sandwich region , found between the N and NTB states under a small temperature gradient.
