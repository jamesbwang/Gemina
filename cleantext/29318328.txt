  To investigate the differences in the interactions of microbial communities in two regions in Taihu Lake with different nutrient loadings ( Meiliang Bay ( MLB) and Xukou Bay ( XKB)) , water samples were collected and both intra- and inter-kingdom microbial community interactions were examined with network analysis. It is demonstrated that all of the bacterioplankton , microeukaryotes and inter-kingdom communities networks in Taihu Lake were non-random. For the networks of bacterioplankton and inter-kingdom community in XKB , higher clustering coefficient and average degree but lower average path length indexes were observed , indicating the nodes in XKB were more clustered and closely connected with plenty edges than those of MLB. The bacterioplankton and inter-kingdom networks were considerably larger and more complex with more module hubs and connectors in XKB compared with those of MLB , whereas the microeukaryotes networks were comparable and had no module hubs or connectors in the two lake zones. The phyla of Acidobacteria , Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetes maintained greater cooperation with other phyla in XKB , rather than competition. The relationships between microbial communities and environmental factors in MLB were weaker. Compared with the microbial community networks of XKB , less modules in networks of MLB were significantly correlated with total phosphorous and total nitrogen.
