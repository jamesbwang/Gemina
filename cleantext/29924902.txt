  The imino-Nazarov cyclization of the polysubstituted pentan-1,4-diene-3-imines was realized. To this aim , a one-pot procedure involving reductive alkenyliminylation of α,β-unsaturated secondary amides with potassium organotrifluoroborates , followed by acid-catalyzed imino-Nazarov cyclization of the polysubstituted pentan-1,4-diene-3-imine intermediates , was studied systematically. This mild , operationally simple , flexible , and high-yielding protocol efficiently affords polysubstituted pentan-1,4-diene-3-imines , cyclopentenimines , and α-amino cyclopentenones , which are useful scaffolds in organic synthesis. The substituent effect at the C2 position of the polysubstituted pentan-1,4-diene-3-imines was studied by means of density-functional theory calculations. Results suggested that the electron-donating group facilitates the imino-Nazarov cyclization process.
