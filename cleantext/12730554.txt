  Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability globally , and its incidence is increasing. The only treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for acute ischemic stroke is thrombolytic treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. As an alternative , therapeutic hypothermia<symptom> has shown excellent potential in preclinical and small clinical studies , but it has largely failed in large clinical studies. This has led clinicians to explore the combination of therapeutic hypothermia<symptom> with other neuroprotective strategies. This review examines preclinical and clinical progress towards developing highly effective combination therapy involving hypothermia<symptom> for stroke patients.
