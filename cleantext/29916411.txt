  Suicide in international police is 2-3-fold that of the general population. Risk factors include suicidal ideation , diagnosis of mood or post-traumatic stress disorders , family/psychological problems , suffered abuse , alcohol use , service suspension , and stigma. A false stigma-related myth is to believe that suicide does not cause concern within military settings. We administered post-training to 6103 Italian Police workers a 30-item questionnaire to assess the perception of suicidal phenomena. We conducted descriptive statistics , principal component analysis , and analyses of variance of data. We identified seven factors , i.e. , health and environmental risk factors; need for new preventive interventions; emotional reaction to suicide; negation , indifference and minimization; utility of current preventive interventions; risk related to personal factors; intervention difficulties. The questionnaire showed content validity and consistency in investigating perceptions about suicide in the State Police. Data synthesis showed a mature approach and appropriate perception of the suicide problem on behalf of Italian State Police workers.
