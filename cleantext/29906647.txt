  This study aimed to investigate the potential of FT-NIR spectroscopy technique combined with chemometrics method , which employed to monitor time-related changes of alcohol concentration and residual glucose during solid state fermentation ( SSF) of ethanol. Characteristic wavelength variables were firstly selected by use of L1-norm regularization approach. Then , the partial least squares ( PLS) regression model was finally developed using the variables selected by L1-norm regularization method to quantitative determine alcohol concentration and residual glucose in SSF of ethanol. Compared with the best results of full-spectrum PLS , the L1-PLS model obtained better results as follows: RMSECV = 1.0392 g/L , R
