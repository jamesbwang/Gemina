  Surgical<disease> Site<disease> Infection<disease> ( SSI) after knee arthroplasty is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that increases the hospital stay , financial burden and mental anguish of the patient. Infection Control Unit at Aga Khan University Hospital ( AKUH) incorporated total knee arthroplasty in its surgical care surveillance program and started collecting data in June 2012. The purpose of this study is to review Surgical<disease> Site<disease> Infection<disease> ( SSI) rates in patients undergoing primary total knee replacement ( TKR) surgery. All patients from June 2012 to December 2013 undergoing knee arthroplasty at our hospital were included. Data was acquired from the hospital SSI database for knee arthroplasty surgery. Data was collected by SSI nurses for inpatients a well as post-discharge monitoring in clinics till 90 days post-op follow-up. The work has been reported in line with the PROCESS criteria. During this time period a total of 164 patients had primary TKR at AKUH. Out of these , 85 patients ( 52 %) had bilateral TKR while 79 ( 48 %) had unilateral TKR. The overall SSI was in 2 patients ( 1.2 %). Identifying SSIs is multidimensional. Since our 2 infected cases after TKR occurred after discharge , this highlights the importance of post-discharge surveillance and not limiting the surveillance for inpatients only. Furthermore , the SSI program may be effective in controlling postoperative
