J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The purpose of the study was to improve the understanding of the strength demands of a handball-specific jump through examining the associations between jump height in a jump throw jump ( JTJ) and measures of lower-body maximum strength and impulse in handball players. For comparison , whether the associations between jump height and strength differed between the JTJ and the customarily used countermovement jump ( CMJ) was also examined. Twenty women handball players from a Norwegian top division club participated in the study. Jump height was measured in the JTJ and in unilateral and bilateral CMJ. Lower-body strength ( maximum isometric force , one-repetition maximum ( 1RM) , impulse at ∼ 60 % and ∼ 35 % 1RM) was measured in seated leg press. The associations between jump height and strength were assessed with correlation analyses and t-tests of dependent r 's were performed to determine if correlations differed between jump tests. Only impulse at ∼ 35 % 1RM correlated significantly with JTJ height ( p < 0.05) , whereas all strength measures correlated significantly with CMJ heights ( p < 0.001). The associations between jump height and strength were significantly weaker in the JTJ than in both CMJ tests for all strength measures ( p = 0.001-0.044) except one. Maximum strength and impulse at ∼ 60 % 1RM did not seem to sufficiently capture the capabilities associated with JTJ height , highlighting the importance of employing tests targeting performance-relevant neuromuscular characteristics when assessing jump-related strength in handball players. Further , CMJ height seemed to represent a wider range of strength capabilities and care should be taken when using it as a proxy for handball-specific movements.
