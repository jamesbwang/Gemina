  Economic pressure highlights the critical need for appropriate diagnosis and treatment of various shoulder pathologies since under-diagnosis and under-treatment can result in increased costs to society in the form of disability and lost production. On the other hand , aggressive over-treatment can further inflate already burgeoning health-care costs and potentially harm the patient. Therefore , it is crucial to distinguish the indications between operative and nonoperative management , especially in common shoulder pathologies such as rotator cuff tears , anterior shoulder instability , biceps tendinitis , lesions<symptom> to the acromioclavicular joint , and proximal humeral fractures. As a result , a detailed analysis of individual risk factors for potential failures should be performed and treatment should be based on individualized care with consideration given to each patient 's particular injury pattern , functional demands , and long-term goals.
