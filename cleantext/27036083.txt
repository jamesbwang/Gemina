  Diabetes distress- commonly encountered as a part of life with diabetes mellitus- can be effectively managed by coping skills training. Systematic assessment and documentation of the existing coping skills ( and lack thereof) is a pre-requisite for planning such coping skills training. A six-item tool , the GlucoCoper- which assesses two negative ( resistance , blame) and four positive ( acceptance , optimism , planning and action) coping mechanisms- was administered to English-literate adult participants with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM) at an endocrine centre in India. Each item was graded on a 10-point Likert scale. The GlucoCoper was administered to 338 participants. The tool demonstrated high internal validity. Total score on the GlucoCoper correlated with fasting and postprandial glucose. The GlucoCoper is a valid tool which can be used to assess and rate coping in persons with T2DM. It has potential in helping plan , deliver and monitor coping skills training in persons with diabetes distress.
