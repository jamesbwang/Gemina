  Echinocandins represent the first-line treatment of candidaemia. Acquired echinocandin resistance is mainly observed among Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and Candida<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> and is associated with FKS hotspot mutations. The commercial Sensititre YeastOne ™ ( SYO) kit is widely used for antifungal susceptibility testing , but interpretive clinical breakpoints are not well defined. We determined echinocandins epidemiological cut-off values ( ECV) for C. albicans/glabrata tested by SYO and assessed their ability to identify FKS mutants in a national survey of candidaemia. Bloodstream isolates of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and C.<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> were collected in 25 Swiss hospitals from 2004 to 2013 and tested by SYO. FKS hotspot sequencing was performed for isolates with an MIC ≥ ECV for any echinocandin. In all , 1277 C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and 347 C.<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> were included. ECV 97.5 % of caspofungin , anidulafungin and micafungin were 0.12 , 0.06 and 0.03 μg/mL for C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , and 0.25 , 0.12 and 0.03 μg/mL for C.<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> , respectively. FKS hotspot sequencing was performed for 70 isolates. No mutation was found in the 52 ` limit wild-type ' isolates ( MIC = ECV for at least one echinocandin). Among the 18 ` non-wild-type ' isolates ( MIC > ECV for at least one echinocandin) , FKS mutations were recovered in the only two isolates with MIC > ECV for all three echinocandins , but not in those exhibiting a ` non-wild-type ' phenotype for only one or two echinocandins. This 10-year nationwide survey showed that the rate of echinocandin resistance among C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and C.<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> remains low in Switzerland despite increased echinocandin use. SYO-ECV could discriminate FKS mutants from wild-type isolates tested by SYO in this population.
