  Recently , a scoring system has been developed to predict which patients with biliary atresia ( BA) who underwent a Kasai procedure should be considered for liver transplant. Here , we applied the scoring system to predict the survival of BA patients following the Kasai procedure at Dr. Sardjito Hospital , Yogyakarta , Indonesia from January 2012 to January 2016. There were 26 patients , of whom 14 were males and 12 females. Outcomes of BA patients after the Kasai surgery were 15 survived and 11 died. There were significant associations between ascites and sepsis<disease> with the liver transplant score of ≥ 8 ( p value = 0.006 and 0.014 , respectively) , whereas post-operative bilirubin level , ALT level , prothrombin time , cirrhosis , esophageal varices , portal hypertension , and cholangitis did not significantly correlate to the score. The patients with a score ≥ 8 have a relatively greater risk by 3.5-fold to die compared with patients with a score < 8 , but it did not reach a significant level ( p value = 0.13). In conclusions , the incidence of ascites and sepsis<disease> might predict the poor prognosis of BA patients following the Kasai procedure. Moreover , patients with a score ≥ 8 are prone to die after the Kasai surgery if they do not undergo a liver transplant.
