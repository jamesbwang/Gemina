  Prophylactic levetiracetam is currently used in ~ 40 % of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> , and the potential impact of levetircetam on health-related quality of life is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that prophylactic levetiracetam is independently associated with differences in cognitive function health-related quality of life. Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. We performed mixed models for T-scores of health-related quality of life , referenced to the U.S. population at 50 Â± 10 , accounting for severity of injury and time to follow-up. Academic medical center. One-hundred forty-two survivors of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom>. None. T-scores of Neuro-Quality of Life Cognitive Function v2 .0 was the primary outcome , whereas Neuro-Quality of Life Mobility v1 .0 and modified Rankin Scale ( a global functional scale) were secondary measures. We prospectively documented if prophylactic levetiracetam was administered and retrieved administration data from the electronic health record. Patients who received prophylactic levetiracetam had worse cognitive function health-related quality of life ( T-score 5.1 points lower; p = 0.01) after adjustment for age ( p = 0.3) , National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( p < 0.000001) , lobar hematoma ( p = 0.9) , and time of assessment; statistical models controlling for prophylactic levetiracetam and the Intracerebral Hemorrhage Score , a global measure of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> severity , yielded similar results. Lower T-scores of cognitive function health-related quality of life at 3 months were correlated with more total levetiracetam dosage ( p = 0.01) and more administered doses of levetiracetam in the hospital ( p = 0.03). Patients who received prophylactic levetiracetam were more likely to have a lobar hematoma ( 27/38 vs 19/104; p < 0.001) , undergo electroencephalography monitoring ( 15/38 vs 21/104; p = 0.02) , but not more likely to have clinical seizures<symptom> ( 4/38 vs 7/104; p = 0.5). Levetiracetam was not independently associated with the modified Rankin Scale scores or mobility health-related quality of life ( p > 0.1). Prophylactic levetiracetam was independently associated with lower cognitive function health-related quality of life at follow-up after intracerebral
