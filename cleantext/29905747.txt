  Reaction of 8-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline with RuCl2 ( PPh3) 3 at room temperature affords the ruthenium ( ii) chelate ( 8-NH2-C9H10N) RuCl2 ( PPh3) 2 ( E) , in which the two triphenylphosphine ligands are disposed mutually cis. By contrast , when the reaction is performed at reflux ligand oxidation/dehydrogenation occurs along with cis-trans reorganization of the triphenylphosphines to form the 8-imino-5,6,7-trihydroquinoline-ruthenium ( ii) complex<pathogen> , ( 8-NH-C9H9N) RuCl2 ( PPh3) 2 ( F). Complex F can also be obtained in higher yield by heating a solution of E alone to reflux. Comparison of their molecular structures highlights the superior binding properties of the bidentate imine ligand in F over its amine-containing counterpart in E. Both complexes are highly effective in the transfer hydrogenation of a wide range of alkyl- , aryl- and cycloalkyl-containing ketones affording their corresponding secondary alcohols with loadings of as low as 0.1 mol %. Significantly , F can deliver excellent conversions even in bench quality 2-propanol in reaction vessels open to the air , whereas the catalytic efficiency of E is diminished by the presence of air but only operates efficiently under inert conditions.
