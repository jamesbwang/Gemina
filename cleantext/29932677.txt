  Second-order nonlinear optical interactions , including second-harmonic generation ( SHG) and sum-frequency generation ( SFG) , can reveal a wealth of information about chemical , electronic , and vibrational dynamics at the nanoscale. Here , we demonstrate a powerful and flexible new approach , called phase-modulated degenerate parametric amplification ( DPA). The technique , which allows for facile retrieval of both the amplitude and phase of the second-order nonlinear optical response , has many advantages over conventional or heterodyne-detected SHG , including the flexibility to detect the signal at either the second harmonic or fundamental field wavelength. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach by imaging multigrain flakes of single-layer MoS
