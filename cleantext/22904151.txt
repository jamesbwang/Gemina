  Fear and anxiety<symptom> about aging have increased amongst female university students and these personal aging concerns are associated with disturbed eating , also prevalent in this group. Evidence suggests concern about aging appearance could account for the link between aging anxiety<symptom> and problem eating in young women due to their belief in the thin- youth ideal. However , whether appearance concern is the strongest aging anxiety<symptom> predictor of global and specific disturbed eating behaviors is unclear. The study examines this in a sample of female students at a Midlands university in the United Kingdom ( N = 200 , 18- 39 years) who completed the Anxiety<symptom> about Aging Scale and the Eating Disorders Inventory-3. The findings show general and a model of four aging anxieties predicted significantly greater global disturbed eating with medium and large effects sizes respectively. However , greater anxiety<symptom> about the psychological challenges and interpersonal losses associated with aging best predicted global and specific disturbed eating behaviors and aging appearance concern was a weaker predictor. Implications for interventions targeting female students eating behavior are considered.
