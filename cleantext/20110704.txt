  Functional anorectal disorders such as faecal incontinence ( FI) , functional anorectal pain , and functional defecation disorders ( FDD) are highly prevalent and represent a high socioeconomic burden. Several tests of anorectal function exist in this setting; however , high-resolution anorectal manometry ( HR-ARM) is a new tool that depicts pressure all along the anal canal and can assess rectoanal coordination. HR-ARM is used in the diagnosis of FI and especially FDD although data in health is still sparse , and pressure phenomena seen during simulated defecation , such as dyssynergia , are highly prevalent in health.
