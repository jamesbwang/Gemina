  Relapse of haematological malignancies after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant is a major cause of mortality. The immunological mechanisms that may lead to disease relapse may include immunological immaturity prior to reconstitution of the allogeneic immune system , tumour antigen downregulation or promotion of T-cell exhaustion<symptom> by interactions with the tumour microenvironment. Current therapeutic strategies for post-transplant relapse are limited in their efficacy and alternative approaches are required. In this review , we discuss the mechanisms of T and NK-cell immune evasion that facilitate relapse of haematological malignancies after allogeneic stem cell transplantation , and explore emerging strategies to augment the allogeneic immune system in order to construct a more potent graft versus tumour response.
