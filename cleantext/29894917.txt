  Previous studies have suggested that GABARG2 ( Gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A Receptor Gamma 2 subunit) could be a gene of interest in genetic epilepsy; through possible associations with increased epilepsy susceptibility or resistance to antiepileptic drugs. The present study was designed to explore whether the GABARG2 C588 T ( rs211037) genetic variant predicts susceptibility to epilepsy and pharmacoresistance among Egyptian children with Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy ( IGE). A cohort of 210 Egyptian children was divided into two groups for this case-control study: group ( I) included 100 children with IGE , group ( II) comprised of 110 paediatric healthy controls. PCR-RFLP was used to amplify the C588 T polymorphism of the GABARG2 gene , which was digested with APOI<pathogen> restriction enzymes. There was a higher frequency of the TT genotype ( P = 0.004) and T allele ( P = 0.002) of the C588 T polymorphism of the GABARG2 gene in patients than controls. Besides , there was a substantial increase of the T allele among drug-resistant patients compared with those responding to antiepileptic drugs ( P = 0.00015). Children with the C allele were four times more likely to be responsive to antiepileptic drugs than non-C-allele-carriers. The C588 T polymorphism of GABARG2 is associated with an increased risk of developing childhood IGE and may modulate patients ' response to antiepileptic drugs.
