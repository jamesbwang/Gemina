  Herein , we describe the in vivo effects of doxorubicin ( DOX) encapsulated in ubiquitous protein apoferritin ( APO) and its efficiency and safety in anti-tumor treatment. APODOX is both passively ( through Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect) and actively targeted to tumors through prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA) via mouse antibodies conjugated to the surface of horse spleen APO. To achieve site-directed conjugation of the antibodies , a HWRGWVC heptapeptide linker was used. The prostate cancer-targeted and non-targeted nanocarriers were tested using subcutaneously implanted LNCaP cells in athymic mice models , and compared to free DOX. Prostate cancer-targeted APODOX retained the high potency of DOX in attenuation of tumors ( with 55 % decrease in tumor volume after 3 weeks of treatment). DOX and non-targeted APODOX treatment caused damage to liver , kidney and heart tissues. In contrast , no elevation in liver or kidney enzymes and negligible changes were revealed by histological assessment in prostate cancer-targeted APODOX-treated mice. Overall , we show that the APO nanocarrier provides an easy encapsulation protocol , reliable targeting , high therapeutic efficiency and very low off-target toxicity , and is thus a promising delivery system for translation into clinical use.
