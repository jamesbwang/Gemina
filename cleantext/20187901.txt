  We investigated the utility of PET/CT in cutaneous melanoma ( CM) patients with pathological negative sentinel lymph nodes ( SLN) , within the first year. The results of PET/CTs and SLN biopsy ( SLNB) in 65 patients ( 39 male and 26 female , mean age 53.8) with a PET/CT in the first postoperative year were evaluated. Within this cohort , the utility of early PET/CT imaging was assessed in patients with negative SLNB. McNemar test was used to compare PET/CT findings with SLNB results. Out of 43 patients with pathologically positive SLNs , 23 patients ( 53.5 %) had positive and 20 patients ( 46.5 %) had negative findings on PET/CT within the first postoperative year. On the other hand , PET/CT results of 22 patients with negative SLNBs were found to be negative in 19 patients ( 86.4 %) and positive in 3 patients ( 13.6 %). For the patients with negative SLNB results , the detection rate of distant metastasis with PET/CT was significantly lower ( p < 0.001) than that in patients with positive SLNBs. Our results showed that
