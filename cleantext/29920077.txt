  Microcystin-LR ( MC-LR) , an algal toxin ( cyanotoxin) common in sources of drinking water , poses a major human health hazard due to its high toxicity. In this study , UV/chlorine was evaluated as a potentially practical and effective process for the degradation of MC-LR. Via mass spectrometry analysis , fewer chlorinated-MC-LR products were detected with UV/chlorine treatment than with chlorination , and a transformation pathway for MC-LR by UV/chlorine was proposed. Different degrees of rapid degradation of MC-LR were observed with varying pH ( 6-10.4) , oxidant dosage ( 0.5-3 mg L
