  During the 3rd trimester , large-scale neural circuits are formed in the human brain , resulting in a highly efficient and segregated connectome at birth. Despite recent findings identifying important preterm human brain network properties such as rich-club organization , how the structural network develops differentially across brain regions and among different types of connections in this period is not yet known. Here , using high resolution diffusion MRI of 77 preterm-born and full-term neonates scanned at 31.9-41.7 postmenstrual weeks ( PMW) , we constructed structural connectivity matrices and performed graph-theory-based analyses. Faster increases of nodal efficiency were mainly located at the brain hubs distributed in primary sensorimotor regions , superior-middle frontal , and precuneus regions during 31.9-41.7 PMW. Higher rates of edge strength increases were found in the rich-club and within-module connections , compared to other connections. The edge strength of short-range connections increased faster than that of long-range connections. Nodal efficiencies of the hubs predicted individual postmenstrual ages more accurately than those of non-hubs. Collectively , these findings revealed more rapid efficiency increases of the hub and rich-club connections as well as higher developmental rates of edge strength in short-range and within-module connections. These jointly underlie network segregation and differentiated emergence of brain functions.
