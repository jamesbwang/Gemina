Also many of breast cancer patients have psychiatric morbidities such as depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom>. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> in breast cancer patients , in order to identify independent predictors of mental health disorders risk. Material and Methods: A cohort of 152 breast cancer patients who were attending an outpatient oncology department was recruited. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire consisted by social , clinical and demographic information and PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scales. Results: The mean age of the patients was 53.25 years ( SD = 12.10) , 69.7 % of the patients underwent mastectomy and 30.3 % ongectomy. Chemotherapy received 46.1 % of patients as adjuvant therapy , 15.8 % radiotherapy and 38.2 % received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A large percentage found to be classified as depressed ( 38.2 %) and anxious ( 32.2 %) and factors that found to be associated were age , marital status , educational level , stage of cancer from univariate analyses and place of residence , religion , symptoms burden from multivariate analysis ( for depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom>). Conclusions: Breast cancer patients are in high risk for developing psychiatric disorders such as depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom>. Being rural resident , non-Orthodox Christian and experiencing extend symptom burden can be predicting factors associated with depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> in breast cancer patients.
