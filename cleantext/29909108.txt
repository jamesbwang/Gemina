  The aim of this study was to study differences in progression of aortic stenosis ( AS) in patients with mediastinal radiotherapy ( XRT)- associated moderate AS versus a matched cohort during the same time frame , and to ascertain need for aortic valve replacement ( AVR) and longer-term survival. Rate of progression of XRT-associated moderate AS and its impact on outcomes is not well-described. We included 81 patients ( age 61 ± 13 years; 57 % female) with at least XRT-associated moderate AS ( aortic valve area ( AVA) 1.05 ± 0.3 cm A total of 100 % of patients had 1 , a total of 71 % had 2 , and 39 % had 3 follow-up TTEs. Before AVR , mean AVG and AVA were not significantly different between XRT and comparison groups. At 3.6 ± 2.0 years from baseline TTE , 146 ( 60 %) underwent AVR ( 16 % transcatheter) , with significantly more patients in the XRT group undergoing AVR ( 80 % vs. 50 %; p < 0.01) , at a much shorter time ( 2.9 ± 1.6 years vs. 4.1 ± 2.4 years; p < 0.01). At 6.6 ± 4.0 years from the initial TTE , 49 ( 20 %) patients died , with a significantly higher mortality in the XRT group ( 40 % vs. 11 %; p < 0.01) , with prior XRT associated with increased longer-term mortality , whereas AVR was associated with improved longer-term survival. In patients with moderate AS , those with prior XRT have a similar rate of progression of AS versus a comparison group. A higher proportion of patients in the XRT group were referred for AVR at a shorter time from baseline TTE. Despite that , the XRT patients had significantly higher longer-term mortality , and prior exposure to XRT was associated with significantly increased longer-term mortality.
