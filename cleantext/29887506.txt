  A theoretical discussion using categorisation theory to discuss the final analysis of findings from research which investigated midwives ' responses to the changed registration-renewal requirements in Australia after the introduction of national registration. In 2010 the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act introduced national registration to standardise the regulation of health professionals in Australia. Annual registration-renewal standards required all health professionals to meet the same standards of clear police check , insurance for scope of practice , Continuing Professional Development ( CPD) and Recency of Practice ( ROP). How did dual registered midwives respond to the changed registration-renewal requirements when national registration was introduced? A longitudinal single case study was conducted in two phases between 2011-2013 with a purposive sample of 24 midwives from five states of Australia to perform individual or group interviews. Participants used inclusion and exclusion criteria to create boundaries around practice to illustrate how they met the registration-renewal standards. Accentuation ( exaggeration) of practice helped them define their separate professional registrations. Boundaries included the type of person being cared for , practice activities. and place of practice. The theory of categorisation helped explain the dual registrants ' behaviour and rationalise their midwifery responses.
