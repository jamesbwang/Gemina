  Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) injury results in detrimental complications. However , little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the reperfusion stage. The aim of the present study was to identify a gene expression profile associated with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The GSE23160 dataset , which comprised data from sham control samples and post‑I/ R injury brain tissues that were obtained using a middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO) model at 2 , 8 and 24 h post‑reperfusion , was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) in the MCAO samples compared with controls were screened using the GEO2R web tool. Gene Ontology ( GO) analysis and Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) pathway analysis for DEGs was performed using the online tool DAVID. Furthermore , a protein‑protein interaction ( PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database and Cytoscape software. In total , 32 DEGs at 2 h post‑reperfusion , 39 DEGs at 8 h post‑reperfusion and 91 DEGs at 24 h post‑reperfusion were identified , while 15 DEGs were common among all three groups. GO analysis revealed that the DEGs at all three time‑points were enriched in ` chemotaxis ' and ` inflammatory response ' terms , while KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that DEGs were significantly enriched in the ` chemokine signaling pathway '. Furthermore , following PPI network construction , Cxcl1 was identified as the only hub gene that was common among all three time‑points. In conclusion , the present study has demonstrated a global view of the potential molecular differences following cerebral I/R injury and may contribute to an improved understanding of the reperfusion stage , which may ultimately aid in the development of future clinical strategies.
