  miR-30d has been shown to play pivotal roles in cancer development , and has the potential to act as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in breast cancer. However , the specific function and molecular mechanism of miR-30d in breast cancer cell growth and metastasis is still unknown. The present study seeks to shed light on the potential contribution of the MiR-30d-KLF-11-STAT3 pathway in breast cancer. The results revealed that miR-30d levels were markedly increased in the breast cancer cell lines BT474 , MDA-MB-231 , HCC197 , and MDA-MB-468 compared with the non-tumor mammary gland MCF10A cell line. Furthermore , the miR-30d mimic increased BT474 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell survival , inhibited apoptosis and increased Bcl-2 expression , whilst inhibited Bax protein levels. miR-30d mimics promote BT474 and MDA-MB-231 cell migration , invasion , and mediate the EMT phenotype. However , miR-30d inhibitors reverse all of the effects of miR-30d mimics on breast cancer cell biology. Also , we observed that KLF-11 is a direct target of miR-30d and KLF-11 and pSTAT3 expression are determined by miR-30d. Finally , the results suggest that miR-30d plays essential roles in breast cancer cells in a manner that is dependent on the levels of KLF-1 and pSTAT3. In summary , miR-30d appears to be a novel diagnostic biomarker and treatment target in breast cancer.
