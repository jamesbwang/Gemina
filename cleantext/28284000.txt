  Early automatic breast cancer detection from mammograms is based on the extraction of lesions<symptom> , known as microcalcifications ( MCs). This paper proposes a new and simple system for microcalcification detection to assist in early breast cancer detection. This work uses the two most recognized public mammogram databases , MIAS and DDSM. We are introducing a MC detection method based on ( 1) Beucher gradient for detection of regions of interest ( ROIs) , ( 2) an annulus model for extraction of few and effective features from candidates to MCs , and ( 3) one classification stage with two different classifiers , k Nearest Neighbor ( KNN) and Support Vector Machine ( SVM). For dense mammograms in the MIAS database , the performance metrics achieved are sensitivity of 0.9835 , false alarm rate of 0.0083 , accuracy of 0.9835 , and area under the ROC curve of 0.9980 with a KNN classifier. The proposed MC detection method , based on a KNN classifier , achieves , a sensitivity , false positive rate , accuracy and area under the ROC curve of 0.9813 , 0.0224 , 0.9795 and 0.9974 for the MIAS database; and 0.9035 , 0.0439 , 0.9298 and 0.9759 for the DDSM database. By slightly reducing the true positive rate the method achieves three instances with false positive rate of 0: 2 on fatty mammograms with KNN and SVM , and one on dense with SVM. The proposed method gives better results than those from state of the art literature , when the mammograms are classified in fatty , fatty-glandular , and dense.
