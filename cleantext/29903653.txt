  Recent changes within community pharmacy have seen a shift towards some pharmacies providing `` value-added '' services. However , providing high levels of service is resource intensive yet revenues from dispensing are declining. Of significance therefore , is how consumers perceive service quality ( SQ). However , at present there are no validated and reliable instruments to measure consumers ' perceptions of SQ in Australian community pharmacies. The aim of this study was to build a theory-grounded model of service quality ( SQ) in community pharmacies and to create a valid survey instrument to measure consumers ' perceptions of service quality. Stage 1 dealt with item generation using theory , prior research and qualitative interviews with pharmacy consumers. Selected items were then subjected to content validity and face validity. Stages 2 and 3 included psychometric testing among English-speaking adult consumers of Australian pharmacies. Exploratory factor analysis was used for item reduction and to explain the domains of SQ.. In stage 1 , item generation for SQ initially generated 113 items which were then refined , through content and face validity , down to 61 items. In stage 2 , after subjecting the questionnaire to psychometric testing on the data from the first pharmacy ( n = 374) , the use of the primary dimensions of SQ was abandoned leaving 32 items representing 5 domains of SQ.. In stage 3 , the questionnaire was subject to further testing and item reduction in 3 other pharmacies ( n = 320). SQ was best described using 23 items representing 6 domains: ` health and medicines advice ' , ` relationship quality ' , ` technical quality ' , ` environmental quality ' , ` non-prescription service ' , and ` health outcomes '. This research presents a theoretically-grounded and robust measurement scale developed for consumer perceptions of SQ in a community pharmacy.
