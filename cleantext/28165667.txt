  Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of statins in Korean and Asian patients. However , most previous studies only observed the percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) and did not consider the effects of various patient conditions simultaneously , such as abnormal test results , patient demographics , and prescribed drugs before taking a statin. Moreover , the characteristics of the patients whose percent reduction in LDL-C was higher than expected were not provided. Therefore , in this study , we aimed to derive meaningful phenotypes by using tensor factorization to observe the characteristics of the patients whose percent reduction in LDL-C was higher than expected among patients taking moderate-intensity statins. In addition , we used the derived phenotypes to predict how much the LDL-C levels of new patients decreased. We consequently identified eight phenotypes that represented the characteristics of the patients whose percent reduction in LDL-C was higher than expected. Moreover , the latent representations of the derived phenotypes achieved prediction performance similar to that obtained using the raw data. These results demonstrate that the derived phenotypes and latent representations are useful tools for observing the characteristics of patients and predicting LDL-C levels. Additionally , our findings provide direction on how to conduct clinical studies in the future.
