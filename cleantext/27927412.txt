  Early-onset scoliosis ( EOS) is defined as a spinal deformity occurring before the age of ten years.Untreated EOS or early spinal fusion resulting in a short spine is associated with increased mortality and cardiopulmonary compromise.EOS may progress rapidly , and therefore prompt clinical diagnosis and referral to a paediatric orthopaedic or spine unit is necessary.Casting under general anaesthesia can be effective and may prevent or delay the need for surgery in curves of less than 60 °. ` Growing ' rods ( traditional or magnetically-controlled) represent the standard surgical treatment in progressive curves of 45 ° or greater.Children with congenital scoliosis associated with fused ribs benefit from surgery with a vertical titanium prosthetic rib.Surgery with growth-friendly instrumentation is associated with a high risk of complications.
