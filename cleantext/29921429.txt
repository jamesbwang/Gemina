  Vaginal injury can result from entry of water into the vagina under high pressure. Previously reported cases describe water-jet vaginal injuries in women participating in water-related activities , including: water skiing , personal watercraft use , waterslides , water hose and fountains , with and without foreign body in situ. We describe the case of a severe vaginal laceration and hemorrhage<symptom> in a 44-year-old female from a high-pressure water-jet generated during a water-ski fall requiring operative repair. Timely management resulted in excellent patient outcome. A literature review demonstrated that , although uncommon , watersport-related gynaecologic injuries can be life-threatening , and women who regularly engage in watersports can be counselled regarding potential preventative measures. Physicians encountering patients with these injuries should rule out intraperitoneal injury and consider benefits of antibiotics.
