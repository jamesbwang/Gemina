  A meta-analysis was performed to observe whether a difference in miRNA-221/ 222 expression exists in thyroid cancer with normal thyroid or BTLs ( benign thyroid lesions<symptom>) and , under this premise , assess its diagnostic efficacy for thyroid cancer. Systematic electronic literature searches were conducted to include PubMed , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and Web of Science. The combined fold change ( FC) was calculated , and pooled estimates of sensitivity , specificity , diagnostic odds ratio ( DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic ( SROC) curves were calculated. Twenty-seven articles were included in this meta-analysis. The combined FC of miRNA-221/ 222 were 13.85 and 13.75 in thyroid cancer with normal control. For miRNA-221/ 222 , the pooled sensitivity was 0.79 ( 95 % CI = 0.73-0.85) , specificity was 0.84 ( 95 % CI = 0.76-0.90) and AUC ( area under the curve) value was 0.88 ( 0.85-0.91). For miRNA-221 , the pooled sensitivity was 0.82 ( 95 % CI = 0.76-0.86) and specificity was 0.84 ( 95 % CI = 0.74-0.91). For miRNA-222 , the pooled sensitivity was 0.78 ( 95 % CI = 0.68-0.85) and specificity was 0.83 ( 95 % CI = 0.70-0.92). Differences in expression levels of miRNA-221/ 222 can provide clues for exploring the etiology of thyroid cancer. In addition , miRNA-221/ 222 were promising molecular biomarkers that may significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid cancer.
