  Background & methods We investigated the in vitro antioxidant and antifungal activity by agar disc diffusion assay of leaf extract of some stinging plants namely , Urtica dioica L. , Tragia involucrate L. , Carduus nutans L. and Mucuna pruriens ( L.) DC. , against pathogenic fungi<pathogen> causing infections/diseases. Results M. pruriens ( Disc 4) , T. involucrate ( Disc 2) , U. dioica ( Disc 1) showed significant antifungal activity against all tested pathogens , while C. nutans ( Disc 3) showed intermediate activity against only Chaetomium<pathogen> globosum<pathogen> ( Cg). The leaf extract of M. Pruriens showed maximum total phenol content ( ~ 1004 µg g-1 dry wt) followed by T. involucrate , C. nutans and U. dioica. However , the ascorbate was observed highest in T. involucrate ( ~ 10.3 µg g-1 dry wt) followed by M. pruriens ( ~ 9.2 µg g-1 dry wt) but the difference was not significant ( p ≤ 0.05). Likewise , M. pruriens showed maximum anthocyanin content ( ~ 0.3 µg g-1 dry wt). The activity of antioxidant enzymes revealed that M. Pruriens showed maximum ascorbate peroxidase ( APX) activity , while the highest guaiacol peroxidase ( GPX) and catalase ( CAT) activities were observed in C. nutans and U. dioica , respectively. Conclusions M. Pruriens showed potential in vitro antioxidant and antifungal activity against studied pathogens that may be used for ethno-pharmacological uses.
