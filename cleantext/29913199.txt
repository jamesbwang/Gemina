  Deciphering the characteristics of dermal fibroblasts is critical to further understand skin ageing. We have conducted a genome-wide transcriptomic characterization of papillary ( Fp) and reticular ( Fr) fibroblasts extracted from human skin samples corresponding to younger and older adult ages. From this screen , biomarkers suitable for the assessment of chronological ageing were identified , and extrapolated to the context of photo-damaged skin. In particular , KANK4 , ACAN , Col<pathogen> XI Î±1 , and PSG1 , were expressed at an increased level in both chronologically-aged and photo-damaged skin. Notably , analysis focused on Fp identified significant transcriptional signatures associated with ageing , which included transcripts related to extracellular matrix , focal adhesion points , and cytoskeleton , thus suggesting functional consequences on tissue structure. At a cellular level , an increased contractility was identified as a property of aged Fp. Accordingly , further investigations were conducted on the KN motif and ankyrin repeat-containing protein 4 ( KANK4) to explore its possible function as an original effector involved in the acquisition of aged properties in Fp , notably their increased contractility. We show that KANK4 down-modulation using siRNA led to increased Rho pathway activity , thereby reducing their contractility. As a proof-of-principle , the present study shows that targeting KANK4 was efficient to attenuate aged Fp characteristics.
