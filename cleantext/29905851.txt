  Tissue macrophages comprise heterogeneous subsets that differ in localization , phenotype and ontogeny. They acquire tissue-specific phenotype in order to maintain normal tissue physiology. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the functions of CD169-positive macrophage subset residing in the lymphoid organs and intestinal tract. Strategically positioned at the interface between tissue and circulating fluid , CD169 + macrophages in the lymphoid organs capture blood- and lymph-borne particulate materials. Antigen information relayed by CD169 + macrophages to neighbouring immune cells is important for enhancement of antimicrobial and antitumour immunity as well as induction of tolerance. In the intestinal tract , CD169 + macrophages localize distantly from epithelial border. Following mucosal injury , they exacerbate inflammation<symptom> by producing CCL8 that recruits inflammatory monocytes. As such , a better understanding of CD169 + macrophage phenotypes may enable the design of tissue-specific therapies for both immunological and non-immunological diseases.
