  Microbial communities play important roles in the function and maintenance of various biosystems , ranging from the human body<symptom> to the environment. A major challenge in microbiome research is the classification of microbial communities of different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple , efficient and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine , agriculture and forensic science. We describe a reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub-samples. Deep learning methods as well as classical approaches were explored for predicting environments and host phenotypes. A k-mer distribution of shallow sub-samples outperformed Operational Taxonomic Unit ( OTU) features in the tasks of body-site identification and Crohn 's disease prediction. Aside from being more accurate , using k-mer features in shallow sub-samples allows ( i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required in OTU-picking and ( ii) provided a proof of concept for the sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for phenotype prediction. In addition , k-mer features predicted representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological environments , and 5 organismal environments with high macro-F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.87. For large datasets , deep learning outperformed classical methods such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The software and datasets are available at https://llp.berkeley.edu/micropheno.
