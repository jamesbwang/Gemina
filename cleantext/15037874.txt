  Hypertension can be found in up to 80 % of patients with acute stroke. Many factors have been related to this phenomenon such as age , history of hypertension , and stroke severity. The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between infarct volume and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , at admission , in young patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients younger than 55 years old admitted within 24 hours of ischemic stroke were included. Socio-demographic variables , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and infarct volume at admission were assessed. Statistical analysis: mean and SEM for quantitative variables , percentages for qualitative , and Spearman correlations ( Twenty-two patients ( 12 men) , mean age: 44.64 ± 1.62 years. The most frequent vascular risk factors were: hypertension , smoking , and overweight ( 40.9 %). Mean systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> on admission were: 143.27 ± 6.57 mmHg and 85.14 ± 3.62 mmHg , respectively. Infarct volume: 11.55 ± 4.74 ml. Spearman correlations: systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and infarct volume: In our series of young patients with acute ischemic stroke , large infarct volume was not associated with high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> at admission.
