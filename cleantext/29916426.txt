  Light chain myeloma ( LCM) is an unusual neoplasm accounting for about 1 8 % of all plasma cell myelomas. It is characterized by the absence of a detectable M protein in the serum and urine protein electrophoresis , altered free light chain ratio , bone<disease> marrow plasmacytosis and related organ or tissue damage. We report a 60-year-old man with LCM presenting with pancytopenia. Urine Bence Jones proteins were negative and serum protein electrophoresis did not reveal an M-band. However , bone<disease> marrow biopsy showed plasmablastic morphology. Subsequent immunohistochemistry showed lambda restriction and cells positive for CD138 and IgM.
