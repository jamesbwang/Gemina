  Wildland fire emissions cause adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes , yet controlled exposure studies to characterize health impacts of specific biomass sources have been complicated by the often latent effects of air pollution. The aim of this study was to determine if postprandial responses after a high fat challenge , long used clinically to predict cardiovascular risk , would unmask latent cardiometabolic responses in rats exposed to peat smoke , a key wildland fire air pollution source. Male Wistar Kyoto<pathogen> rats were exposed once ( 1 h) to filtered air ( FA) , or low ( 0.36 mg/m
