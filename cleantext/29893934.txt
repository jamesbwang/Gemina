  Onartuzumab is an engineered single arm , monovalent monoclonal antibody that targets the MET receptor and prevents HGF signaling. Knockout mice have clearly demonstrated that HGF/MET signaling is developmentally critical. A pre- and post-natal development ( PPND) study ( enhanced design) was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys to evaluate the potential developmental consequences following onartuzumab administration. Control or onartuzumab , at loading/maintenance doses of 75/50 mg/kg ( low) or 100/100 mg/kg ( high) , was administered intravenously once weekly to 12 confirmed pregnant female cynomolgus monkeys per group from gestation day ( GD) 20 through GD 174. Onartuzumab administration resulted in decreased gestation length , decreased birth weight , and increased fetal and perinatal mortality. A GD147 C-section was conducted for a subset of Control and High Dose monkeys , and identified placental infarcts with hemorrhage<symptom> in the chorionic plate , chorionic villus and/or decidual plate. These findings were limited to placentas from onartuzumab-treated animals. In addition , decreased cellularity of the hepatocytes with dilated hepatic sinusoids was inconsistently observed in the liver of a few fetal or infant monkeys that died in the perinatal period. Surviving offspring had some evidence of developmental delay compared to controls , but no overt teratogenicity. Overall , effects on the perinatal fetuses were consistent with those reported in knockout mice , but not as severe. Onartuzumab concentrations were low or below the level of detection in most offspring , with cord blood concentrations only 1-2 % of maternal levels on GD 147. Malperfusion secondary to onartuzumab-induced placental injury could explain the adverse pregnancy outcomes , fetal growth restriction and relatively low fetal exposures.
