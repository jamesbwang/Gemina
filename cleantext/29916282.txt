  Objective To develop a combinatorial panel of salivary cytokines that manifests the presence of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) that will eventually improve prognosis by facilitating the early diagnosis and management of this common cancer. Methods We performed a case-control study comparing salivary cytokine profiles of 35 adult subjects with NSCLC with those of 35 matched , healthy nonsmokers. Multiplex bead array assays were used to quantify 27 cytokines in saliva , serum , and oral mucosal transudate samples. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop an informative cytokine panel. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the discriminant ability of the panel. Results A combinatorial 12-cytokine panel ( interleukin receptor antagonist ( IL1RN) , IL1B , IL6 , IL7 , IL8 , IL10 , C-C motif chemokine ligand 11 ( CCL11) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor , C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 ( CXCL10) , C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 , C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 , and platelet-derived growth factor-BB) distinguished patients with NSCLC from healthy controls. Further , ROC analysis revealed that a cytokine panel comprising IL10 ( odds ratio , 1.156) and CXCL10 ( odds ratio , 1.000) discriminated NSCLC with a sensitivity of 60.6 % and specificity of 80.8 % ( area under the ROC curve , 0.701). Conclusion A combinatorial panel of select salivary cytokines indicates the presence of NSCLC.
