  The stellate ganglia are the predominant source of sympathetic innervation to the heart. Remodeling of the nerves projecting to the heart has been observed in several cardiovascular diseases , however studies of adult stellate ganglia are limited. A profile of the baseline transcriptomic and neurochemical characteristics of the stellate ganglia in adult C57Bl6j mice , a common model for the study of cardiovascular diseases , may aid future investigations. We have generated a dataset of baseline measurements of mouse stellate ganglia using RNAseq , HPLC and mass spectrometry. Expression differences between male and female mice were identified. These differences included physiologically important genes for growth factors , receptors and ion channels. While the neurochemical profiles of male and female stellate ganglia were not different , minor differences in neurotransmitter content were identified in heart tissue.
