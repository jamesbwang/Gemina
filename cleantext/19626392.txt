  Conditioned place preference ( CPP) tests in rodents have been well established to measure preference induced by secondary reinforcing properties , but conventional assays are not sensitive enough to measure innate , weak preference , or the primary reinforcing property of a conditioned stimulus. We designed a novel CPP assay with better sensitivity and efficiency in quantifying and ranking preference of particular sounds<symptom> among multiple alternatives. Each test tone was presented according to the location of free-moving rats in the arena , where assignment of location to each tone changed in every 20-s session. We demonstrated that our assay was able to rank tone preference among 4 alternatives within 12.5 min ( 125 s ( habituation) + 25 s/sessions Ã— 25 sessions). In order to measure and rank sound preference , we attempted to use sojourn times with each test sound<symptom> ( ( Formula: see text)) , and a preference index ( PI) based on transition matrices of initial and end sounds<symptom> in every session. Both ( Formula: see text) and PI revealed similar trends of innate preference in which rats preferred test conditions in the following order: silence , 40- , 20- , then 10-kHz tones<symptom>. Further , rats exhibited a change in preference after an classical conditioning of the 20-kHz tone with a rewarding microstimulation of the dopaminergic system. We also demonstrated that PI was a more robust and sensitive indicator than ( Formula: see text) when the locomotion activity level of rats became low due to habituation to the assay repeated over sessions. Thus , our assay offers a novel method of evaluating auditory preference that is superior to conventional CPP assays , offering promising prospects in the field of sensory neuroscience.
