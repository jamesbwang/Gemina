  Dental pulp stem cells constitute an attractive source of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells owing to their high proliferation rate and multilineage differentiation potential. Osteogenesis is initiated by osteoblasts , which originate from mesenchymal stem cells. These cells express specific surface antigens that disappear gradually during osteodifferentiation. In parallel , the appearance of characteristic markers , including alkaline phosphatase , collagen type I , osteocalcin and osteopontin characterize the osteoblastic phenotype of dental pulp stem cells. This review will shed the light on the osteogenic differentiation potential of dental pulp stem cells and explore the culture medium components , and markers associated with osteodifferentiation of these cells.
