  With the phasing out of long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( PFASs) , production of a wide variety of alternative PFASs has increased to meet market demand. However , little is known about the bioaccumulation potential of these replacement compounds. Here , we developed a modeling workflow that combines molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation techniques to estimate the relative binding affinity of a total of 15 legacy and replacement PFASs for human and rat liver-type fatty acid binding protein ( hLFABP and rLFABP). The predicted results were compared with experimental data extracted from three different studies. There was good correlation between predicted free energies of binding and measured binding affinities , with correlation coefficients of 0.97 , 0.79 , and 0.96 , respectively. With respect to replacement PFASs , our results suggest that EEA and ADONA are at least as strongly bound to rLFABP as perfluoroheptanoic acid ( PFHpA) , and as strongly bound to hLFABP as perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA). For F-53 and F-53B , both have similar or stronger binding affinities than perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS). Given that interactions of PFASs with proteins ( e.g. , LFABPs) are important determinants of bioaccumulation potential in organisms , these alternatives could be as bioaccumulative as legacy PFASs , and are therefore not necessarily safer alternatives to long-chain PFASs.
