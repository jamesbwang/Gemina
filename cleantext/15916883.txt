  There is a growing use of novel psychoactive substances containing synthetic cannabinoids. Synthetic cannabinoid products have effects similar to those of natural cannabis , yet , these drugs are more potent and dangerous , and have been associated with dangerous adverse effects. Here , we review current literature on the epidemiology , acute , and chronic effects of synthetic and natural cannabinoid-based drugs. Synthetic drugs contain a mixture of psychoactive compounds that mostly bind cannabinoid receptors with high potency. These synthetic drugs replicate the effects of natural cannabis and Î”9-tetrahydrocannabinol but they induce more severe adverse effects including respiratory difficulties , hypertension , tachycardia<symptom> , chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , muscle twitches , acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , agitation , psychosis , suicidal ideation , and cognitive impairment. Chronic use of synthetic cannabinoids has been associated with serious psychiatric and medical conditions and even death. Given the growing popularity in the use of cannabinoid-based drugs and their harmful potential , there is a need for further research in this field.
