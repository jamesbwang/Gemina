  Methanotrophic bacteria are widespread and use methane as a sole carbon and energy source. They also play a crucial role in marine ecosystems by preventing the escape of methane into the atmosphere from diverse methane sources , such as methane seeps and hydrothermal vents. Despite their importance for methane carbon cycling , relatively few marine methanotrophic bacteria have been isolated and studied at the genomic level. Herein , we report the genome of a marine methanotrophic member of the genus Methylomicrobium , metagenome-assembled genome ( MAG) wino1 , which was obtained through enrichment using methane as the sole carbon source. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences and comparison of pmoA genes supported the close relationship of MAG-wino1 to the genus Methylomicrobium and it possessed a genome of 5.06 Mb encoding many specialized methanotrophic genes. A comparison of MAG-wino1 with the genomes of other strains ( Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z
