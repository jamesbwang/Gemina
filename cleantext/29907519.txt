  Testing for Turkeys ( TFT) HIV/hepatitis C virus<pathogen> ( HCV) and sexually transmitted infection ( STI) testing initiative is a joint effort between Older Women Embracing Life ( OWEL) , Inc. , a nonprofit faith-based community HIV<pathogen> support and advocacy organization; the Johns Hopkins University Regional Partner MidAtlantic AIDS Education and Training Center ( MAAETC); and the University of Maryland , Baltimore JACQUES Initiative ( JI) , and is now in its 11th year of providing HIV<pathogen> outreach , testing , and linkage to care. Since 2008 , the annual TFT daylong community HIV<pathogen> testing and linkage to care initiative has been held 2 weeks before Thanksgiving at a faith-based center in Baltimore , Maryland , in a zip code where one in 26 adults and adolescents ages 13 years and older are living with HIV<pathogen> ( Maryland Department of Health , Center for HIV<pathogen> Surveillance , Epidemiology , and Evaluation , 2017). TFT includes a health fair with vendors that supply an abundance of education information ( handouts , videos , one-on-one counseling) and safer sex necessities , including male and female condoms , dental dams , and lube. Nutritious boxed lunches and beverages are provided to all attendees and volunteers. Everyone tested for HIV<pathogen> who stays to obtain their results is given a free frozen turkey as they exit. The Baltimore City Health Department is on hand with a confidential no-test list ( persons in the state already known to have HIV<pathogen>) to diminish retesting of individuals previously diagnosed with HIV<pathogen>. However , linkage to care is available to everyone: newly diagnosed individuals and those previously diagnosed and currently out of care.
