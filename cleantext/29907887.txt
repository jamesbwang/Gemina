  YH4808 is a potassium-competitive acid blocker , developed for the treatment of acid-related disorders. Two clinical studies in healthy male subjects were conducted to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of YH4808. The first study , a randomized , three-treatment , three-period , crossover study , compared pharmacokinetics of YH4808 ( 300 mg) after a single dose at fed state with a standard or a high-fat meal to those at fasted state. The second study , a randomized , two-treatment , two-period , crossover study , investigated pharmacokinetics at fasted or fed state with a standard meal after twice daily dose of YH4808 ( 100 mg) for 7 days. Bloods<symptom> for pharmacokinetic evaluation were sampled up to 48 h post-dose and 24 h post-dose at steady state , respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by non-compartmental method. After single dosing , the geometric means of maximum plasma concentration increased by 1.2 and 2.1 times in the fed states with a standard meal and a high-fat meal , respectively , of that in fasted state. Corresponding values of area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC) from time 0 to the last measurable time point increased by 1.8 and 2.8 times , respectively. After multiple dosing , the geometric mean for 24-h AUC at steady state slightly increased in fed state by 1.1 times of that in fasted state. As fat content of the food increased , the systemic exposure of YH4808 after single dosing increased. However , systemic exposures at steady state after multiple dosing between fasted and fed states were similar. ClinicalTrials.gov registry no.: NCT01520012.
