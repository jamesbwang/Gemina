  Tropical montane cloud forests ( TMCF) are ecosystems particularly sensitive to climate change; however , the effects of warmer and drier conditions on TMCF ecohydrology remain poorly understood. To investigate functional responses of TMCF trees to reduced water availability , we conducted a study during the 2014 dry season in the lower altitudinal limit of TMCF in central Veracruz , Mexico. Temporal variations of transpiration , depth of water uptake and tree water sources were examined for three dominant , brevi-deciduous species using micrometeorological , sap flow and soil moisture measurements , in combination with oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition of rainfall , tree xylem , soil and stream water. Over the course of the dry season , reductions in crown conductance and transpiration were observed in canopy species ( 43 and 34 % , respectively) and mid-story trees ( 23 and 8 %) , as atmospheric demand increased and soil moisture decreased. Canopy species consistently showed more depleted isotope values compared to mid-story trees. However , MixSIAR Bayesian model results showed that the evaporated ( enriched) soil water pool was the main source for trees despite reduced soil moisture. Additionally , while increases in tree water uptake from deeper to shallower soil water sources occurred , concomitant decreases in transpiration were observed as the dry season progressed. A larger reduction in deep soil water use was observed for canopy species ( from 79 ± 19 to 24 ± 20 %) compared to mid-story trees ( from 12 ± 17 to 10 ± 12 %). The increase in shallower soil water sources may reflect a trade-off between water and nutrient requirements in this
