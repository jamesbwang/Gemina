  Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM1) is one of the most common chronic<disease> diseases<disease> observed during childhood. The incidence of DM1 is increasing worldwide , and there is currently no way to prevent or delay the onset or to cure the disease. Most diseases , including diabetes , stem from abnormalities in the functioning of proteins , and some studies have reported the expression of protein variation to be involved in the development of DM1. Thus , the aim of this study was to investigate the differential expression of serum proteins in patients with DM1. Serum of patients with DM1 ( n = 30) and healthy controls ( n = 30) was collected. A proteomic approach was used with depletion of albumin and immunoglobulin G chromatography on serum samples followed by data-independent , label-free mass spectrometric analysis. A total of eight serum proteins were identified as being differentially expressed and involved in the immune system , lipid metabolism , and pathways of coagulation. DM1 was associated with the upregulation of six proteins: alpha-2-macroglobulin , apolipoprotein A-II , Î²2 glycoprotein I , Ig alpha-2 chain C region , alpha-1-microglobulin , and prothrombin. A total of two proteins were downregulated , including pregnancy zone protein and complement C4. To the best of our knowledge , these findings show differential expression of proteins revealing new proteins that may be involved in the development and progression of diabetes.
