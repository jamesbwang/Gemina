  Background: Telomeres are involved in chromosomal stability , cellular immortality and tumorigenesis. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( TERT) is essential for the maintenance of telomere DNA length. Recently , a variable tandem-repeats polymorphism , MNS16A , located in the downstream region of the TERT gene , was reported to have an effect on TERT expression and telomerase activity. Previous studies have linked both relative telomere length ( RTL) and TERT variants with cancer. Therefore , we evaluated associations between RTL , TERT gene polymorphisms ( hTERT , rs2735940 C/T and MNS16A Ins/Del) and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) in an Iranian population. Methods: RTL was determined by a multiplex quantitative PCR-based method , and variants of the hTERT , rs2735940 C/T and MNS16A Ins/Del , were genotyped by amplification refractory mutation system PCR ( ARMS-PCR) , and PCR , respectively. Results: Our results indicated that RTL was shorter in ALL patients ( 1.53 ± 0.12) compared to the control group ( 2.04 ± 0.19) ( P = 0.029). However , no associations between hTERT gene variants or haplotypes and the risk of childhood ALL were observed ( P > 0.05). Also hTERT polymorphisms were not associated with RTL or patient clinicopathological characteristics , including age ( P = 0.304) , sex ( P = 0.061) organomegally ( P = 0.212) CSF involvement ( P = 0.966) or response to treatment ( P = 0.58). Conclusions: We found that telomere attrition may be related to the pathogenesis of childhood ALL , irrespective to TERT variants.
