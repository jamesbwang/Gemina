  The hypothalamus determinates metabolic processes in liver through endocrine and autonomic control. Hypothalamic neuropeptides , such as thyrotropin releasing hormone or vasopressin , have been involved in liver metabolism. The thyroid status influences metabolic processes including liver metabolism in modulating those hypothalamic peptides whose functional status is regulated in part by aminopeptidase activities. In order to obtain data for a possible coordinated interaction between hypothalamus , plasma and liver , of some aminopeptidase activities that may partially reflect the hydrolysis of those peptides , pyroglutamyl- ( pGluAP) and cystinyl- ( CysAP) beta-naphthylamide hydrolyzing activities were determined fluorimetrically , both in their soluble and membrane-bound forms , in eu- hypo- and hyperthyroid adult male rats. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were induced with daily subcutaneous injections of tetraiodothyronine ( 300 Î¼g/kg/day) or with 0.03 % methimazole in drinking water for 6 weeks. Results demonstrated significant changes depending on the type of enzyme and the thyroid status. The most striking changes were observed for CysAP in liver where it was reduced in hypothyroidism and increased in hyperthyroidism. Significant intra- and inter-tissue correlations were observed. While there were positive inter-tissue correlations between liver , plasma and hypothalamus in eu-and hypothyroid rats , a negative correlation between hypothalamus and liver was observed in hyperthyroidism. These results suggest the influence of thyroid hormones and an interactive role for these activities in the control of liver metabolism. The present data also suggest a role for CysAP and pGluAP activities in liver function linked to their activities in hypothalamus.
