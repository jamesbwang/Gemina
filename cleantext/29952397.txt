  The objective of the current article is to present the main challenges for the implementation of the new recommendations for early detection of breast cancer in Brazil , and to reflect on the barriers and the strategies to overcome them. The implementation of evidence-based guidelines is a global challenge , and traditional strategies based only on disseminating their recommendations have proven insufficient for changing prevailing clinical practice. A major challenge for adherence to the new guidelines for early detection of breast cancer in Brazil is the current pattern in the use of mammographic screening in the country , which very often includes young women and a short interval between tests. Such practice , harmful to the population 's health , is reinforced by the logic of defensive medicine and the dissemination of erroneous information that overestimates the benefits of screening and underestimates or even omits its harms. In addition , there is a lack of policies and measures focused on early diagnosis of symptomatic cases. To overcome these barriers , changes in the regulation of care , financing , and implementation of shared decision-making in primary care are essential. Audit and feedback , academic detailing , and the incorporation of decision aids are some of the strategies that can facilitate implementation of the new recommendations.
