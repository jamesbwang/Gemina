  Selenium ( Se) is commonly recognized as a protective element with an antagonistic effect against mercury ( Hg) toxicity. However , the mechanisms of this Hg-Se antagonism are complex and remain controversial. To gain insight into the Hg-Se antagonism , a type of unicellular eukaryotic protozoa ( Tetrahymena malaccensis , T. malaccensis) was selected and individually or jointly exposed to two Hg and three Se species. We found that Se species showed different toxic effects on the proliferation of T. malaccensis with the toxicity following the order: selenite ( Se ( IV)) > selenomethionine ( SeMeth) > selenate ( Se ( VI)). The Hg-Se antagonism in Tetrahymena was observed because the joint toxicity significantly decreased under co-exposure to highly toxic dosages of Hg and Se versus individual toxicity. Unlike Se ( IV) and Se ( VI) , non-toxic dosage of SeMeth significantly decreased the Hg toxicity , revealing the influence of the Se species and dosages on the Hg-Se antagonism. Unexpectedly , inorganic divalent Hg ( Hg
