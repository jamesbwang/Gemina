  Dental age plays a significant role in forensic dentistry , orthodontics and paediatric dentistry , as well as in general diagnosis and treatment planning. Different methods have been developed to determine dental age.

The purpose of this study was to assess the dental age of Omani children using Demirjian 's method and evaluate the applicability of the method in dental age estimation for Omani children. The sample consisted of 485 digital panoramic radiographs of children ( 264 males , 221 females) aged between 4.6 years and 16.5 years , and obtained from the records of the Military Dental Centre in Oman.
