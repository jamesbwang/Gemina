  Within a natural scene it is not uncommon for an object 's shape to be revealed over time. We investigated whether the same integration of shape information that happens around a fully visible contour also happens when that information is distributed over time. In a two-interval forced-choice task , observers discriminated between a radial frequency ( RF) pattern and a circle that were revealed either using an implicit slit or traced out by a dot 's motion; and a line and a modulated line that were either contour-defined or motion-defined. First , with presentation times of approximately 1 s , we found no difference in the strength of integration when comparing a freely visible contour to one that ( a) moved behind a slit; ( b) was revealed by a moving slit; or ( c) revealed piecemeal by a slit appearing at random locations ( Experiment 1). Changing the duration of presentation ( 250-4,000 ms) had no effect on strength of integration or threshold for detection within the moving slit condition ( Experiment 2). Considering these results , Experiment 3 revisited integration for a dot tracing out an RF path ( Or , Thabet , Wilkinson , & Wilson , 2011) , finding removal of a change in speed cue increased the strength of integration to that found in Experiments 1 and 2 of the current study. The pattern of results for modulated lines was different from RF patterns; however , within these conditions , there was no difference in strength of integration between contour-defined and motion-defined stimuli. Our results suggest motion-defined patterns are processed as form from motion.
