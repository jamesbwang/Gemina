  Early detection and risk factor control prevent chronic kidney disease ( CKD) progression. Evaluation of peripheral autonomic dysfunction may detect incident cardiovascular-renal events in type 2 diabetes ( T2D). SUDOSCAN , a non-invasive tool , provides an age-adjusted electrochemical skin conductance ( ESC) composite score incorporating hands/feet ESC measurements , with a score ≤ 53 indicating sudomotor dysfunction. A consecutive cohort of 2833 Chinese adults underwent structured diabetes assessment in 2012-13; 2028 participants without preexisting cardiovascular disease ( CVD) and CKD were monitored for incident cardiovascular-renal events until 2015. In this prospective cohort ( mean age 57.0 ( standard deviation ( SD) 10.0) years; median T2D duration 7.0 ( interquartile range ( IQR) 3.0-13.0) years; 56.1 % men; 72.5 % never-smokers; baseline ESC composite score 60.7 ( SD 14.5)) , 163 ( 8.0 %) and 25 ( 1.2 %) participants developed incident CKD and CVD , respectively , after 2.3 years of follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratios ( aHRs) per 1-unit decrease in the ESC composite score for incident CKD , CVD and all-cause death were 1.02 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.01-1.04) , 1.04 ( 1.00-1.07) and 1.04 ( 1.00-1.08) , respectively. Compared with participants with an ESC composite score > 53 , those with a score ≤ 53 had an aHR of 1.56 ( 95 % CI 1.09-2.23) for CKD and 3.11 ( 95 % CI 1.27-7.62) for CVD , independent of common risk markers. When added to clinical variables ( sex and duration of diabetes) , the ESC composite score improved discrimination of all outcomes with appropriate reclassification of CKD risk. A low ESC composite score independently predicts incident cardiovascular-renal events and death in T2D , which may improve the screening strategy for early intervention.
