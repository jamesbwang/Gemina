  To study the effects of ursolic acid on liver injury in diabetic mice induced by high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin ( STZ) , and to explore its possible mechanisms. Diabetes mellitus was induced in twenty male ICR mice by a combination of high-fat diet for 6 weeks with low-dose streptozotocin ( 30 mg/kg , i. p.) for 5 consecutive days. After 9 days , fasting blood glucose levels were determined. Mice with fasting blood glucose levels exceeded 11. 1 mmol/L were diagnosed as diabetic mice and selected for further experiment. These mice were randomly divided into two groups ( each group of 10): diabetic group , ursolic acid group ( 100 mg/kg , i. g.) , and another 10 mice were set as control group. After continuous administration for 8 weeks , body<symptom> weight ( BW) were weighed , fasting blood glucose ( FBG) , total cholesterol ( TC) , triglyceride ( TG) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , aspartate transaminase ( AST) in serum and superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) in liver were measured. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes of liver tissue. Compared with the control group , the level of FBG , TC , TG , ALT , AST , MDA were dramatically increased ( Ursolic acid has a protective effect on liver injury in diabetic mice induced by high-fat diet combined with STZ by intraperitoneal ingector , and its mechanism may be associated with lowering blood glucose , regulating the lipid metabolism , reducing oxidative stress and enhancing the ability of anti-oxidation in liver.
