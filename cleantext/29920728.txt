  Rate-related left bundle branch block ( LBBB) is a well-studied phenomenon. Cardiac memory is another physiologic phenomenon in which T-wave abnormalities occur in the absence of ischemia. The association between these two phenomena has been described in several case reports. A literature review was performed through OVID and Pubmed , where at total of 93 cases of rate- related LBBB were identified. Cases were reviewed and data were collected on rates of appearance and disappearance as well as the presence or absence of cardiac memory. There is some overlap in the rate at which LBBB appear. Cardiac memory is associated with rate-related LBBB in several cases but its true prevalence is unknown. Cardiac memory is a phenomenon that is well described in the literature but is often under-recognized in clinical practice. As a consequence of overlooking this phenomenon and not including cardiac memory in the differential when T-wave abnormalities are observed , patients may be subjected to unnecessary invasive diagnostic testing.
