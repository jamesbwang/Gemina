  Continuous monitoring of natural human gait in real-life environments is essential in many applications including disease monitoring , rehabilitation , and professional sports. Wearable inertial measurement units are successfully used to measure body kinematics in real-life environments and to estimate total walking ground reaction forces GRF ( t) using equations of motion. However , for inverse dynamics and clinical gait analysis , the GRF ( t) of each foot is required separately. Using an experimental dataset of 1243 tri-axial separate-foot GRF ( t) time histories measured by the authors across eight years , this study proposes the ` Twin Polynomial Method ' ( TPM) to estimate the tri-axial left and right foot GRF ( t) signals from the total GRF ( t) signals. For each gait cycle , TPM fits polynomials of degree five , eight , and nine to the known single-support part of the left and right foot vertical , anterior-posterior , and medial-lateral GRF ( t) signals , respectively , to extrapolate the unknown double-support parts of the corresponding GRF ( t) signals. Validation of the proposed method both with force plate measurements ( gold standard) in the laboratory , and in real-life environment showed a peak-to-peak normalized root mean square error of less than 2.5 % , 6.5 % and 7.5 % for the estimated GRF ( t) signals in the vertical , anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions , respectively. These values show considerable improvement compared with the currently available GRF ( t) decomposition methods in the literature.
