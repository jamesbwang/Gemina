  Accurate early risk prediction for gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) would target intervention and prevention in women at the highest risk. We evaluated novel biomarker predictors to develop a first-trimester risk prediction model in a large multiethnic cohort. Maternal clinical , aneuploidy and pre-eclampsia screening markers ( PAPP-A , free hCGÎ² , mean arterial pressure , uterine artery pulsatility index) were measured prospectively at 11-13 +6 weeks ' gestation in 980 women ( 248 with GDM; 732 controls). Nonfasting glucose , lipids , adiponectin , leptin , lipocalin-2 , and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 were measured on banked serum. The relationship between marker multiples-of-the-median and GDM was examined with multivariate regression. Model predictive performance for early ( < 24 weeks ' gestation) and overall GDM diagnosis was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves. Glucose , triglycerides , leptin , and lipocalin-2 were higher , while adiponectin was lower , in GDM ( p < 0.05). Lipocalin-2 performed best in Caucasians , and triglycerides in South Asians with GDM. Family history of diabetes , previous GDM , South/East Asian ethnicity , parity , BMI , PAPP-A , triglycerides , and lipocalin-2 were significant independent GDM predictors ( all p < 0.01) , achieving an area under the curve of 0.91 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.89-0.94) overall , and 0.93 ( 95 % CI 0.89-0.96) for early GDM , in a combined multivariate prediction model. A first-trimester risk prediction model , which incorporates novel maternal lipid markers , accurately identifies women at high risk of GDM , including early GDM.
