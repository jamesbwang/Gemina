  The synthesis of a novel naphthalenediimide ( NDI)- bithiazole ( Tz2)- based polymer ( P ( NDI2OD-Tz2)) is reported , and structural , thin-film morphological , as well as charge transport and thermoelectric properties are compared to the parent and widely investigated NDI-bithiophene ( T2) polymer ( P ( NDI2OD-T2)). Since the steric repulsions in Tz2 are far lower than in T2 , P ( NDI2OD-Tz2) exhibits a more planar and rigid backbone , enhancing π-π chain stacking and intermolecular interactions. In addition , the electron-deficient nature of Tz2 enhances the polymer electron affinity , thus reducing the polymer donor-acceptor character. When n-doped with amines , P ( NDI2OD-Tz2) achieves electrical conductivity ( ≈ 0.1 S cm
