  A groin mass is an unusual presentation of hip-related problems. Paralabral cysts<symptom> are common radiographic findings that are often associated with intraarticular pathology. The authors describe a 57-year-old woman who presented with a left groin mass for 6 months. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an acetabular paralabral cyst<symptom> at the anterior aspect of the hip<symptom> joint. Arthroscopic paralabral cyst<symptom> decompression was performed. An associated degenerative anterosuperior labrum and partial tear of the ligamentum teres were also identified and treated with arthroscopic debridement. Postoperative imaging showed complete resolution of the cyst<symptom>. There was no recurrence at the 2-year follow-up. ( Orthopedics. 201x; xx ( x): xx-xx.).
