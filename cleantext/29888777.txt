  The pentapeptide Cys-Ala-Leu-Asn-Asn ( CALNN) could stabilize gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) , most of which serve as anchoring blocks for various bioanalyses by introducing recognition blocks. However , the typical conjugation strategy greatly suffers from excessive use of peptides , overnight incubation and consequently low efficiency. In this study , new design criteria for the efficacious anchor were established. In addition , a stable , instantaneous and effective modification of the anchoring peptide RRFPDD or its derivatives on AuNPs is first proposed for the first time. With low consumption of peptides ( 50 Î¼M) , the loading process could be realized in 100 seconds. The anchor RRFPDD also allowed for the quantitative adsorption of appended recognition blocks ( e.g. , peptides or DNAs) , thus adjusting their proportions for better performance. In particular , the biological characteristics of those recognition blocks were fully retained. Furthermore , the anchor RRFPDD contributed to a time-saving and high-efficiency ( 85 %) hydrolysis of peptide-capped AuNPs. Considering these advantages of the new anchor , a reliable assay for cardiac troponin I ( cTnI) was developed with a detection limit as low as 0.45 ng mL-1 , and also successfully applied in human serum samples.
