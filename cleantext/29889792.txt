  This study aimed to identify limitations and challenges associated with existing instruments and techniques used in totally endoscopic ear surgery ( TEES). Otologic instruments , traditionally developed for two-handed surgery with operating microscopes , are not necessarily optimized for the TEES environment. Better understanding of technical challenges and the limitations of current instrumentation may allow advances in instrument design for TEES surgery. This cross-sectional study employed a mixed-methods nine-question survey that was distributed internationally to surgeons with an interest in TEES. Respondents were asked to classify their TEES experience and instrumentation used , rate their need for better instrumentation to address six TEES-related challenges using visual analog scales , and comment on how to modify or develop new instrumentation. With 51 respondents , we quantified a need for better instruments to address the following 6 potential TEES challenges ordered from greatest to least need: 1) reaching structures visualized by the endoscope , 2) dissection and removal of cholesteatoma , 3) cutting and/or removing bone , 4) bleeding control , 5) keeping the endoscope lens clean , 6) moving and positioning a graft into the intended place. The majority of surgeons perceive a need for improved instrumentation to address each challenge. Challenges 1) and 2) were associated with significantly greater need than the others ( p < 0.05 , Wilcoxon method for nonparametric pairwise comparisons). In addition to highlighting and quantifying some of the common TEES challenges , these findings provide valuable insight into the design requirements for developing improved surgical instrumentation and techniques.
