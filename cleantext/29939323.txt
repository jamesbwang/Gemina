  Continuous Subcutaneous<disease> Insulin Infusion ( CSII) and Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems ( CGMS) have been proven very effective in diabetes management. This study evaluated the usefulness of these devices during prolonged , intense physical activity in an uncontrolled natural environment away from the clinical research center. Non-randomized , prospective , observational study. During the summer thirty-eight participants with Type 1 Diabetes crossed the Samaria gorge , the 2nd largest gorge in Europe ( 17 km). Twenty subjects on CSII combined with real-time CGMS and eighteen on Multiple Daily Injections ( MDI) combined with professional ( retrospective) CGMS participated in the program. All participants were unsupervised during the event. All 38 participants managed to reach the destination point safely. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia. The duration of the exercise ( mean ± SD) was 6.4 ± 1.3 hours. The CSII group exhibited significantly lower hypoglycemic episodes during exercise ( 0.1 ± 0.3 vs 0.4 ± 0.6; P = 0.047) as well as lower AUC below 70 mg/dl compared to the MDI , during the 24 hours ( 0.61 ± 0.78 vs1 .84 ± 1.55; P = 0.007). Individuals on CSII were significantly less likely to develop a hypoglycemic episode during exercise ( P = 0.038). Exercise induced nocturnal hypoglycemia was not prevented effectively in neither group. CSII combined with CGMS is effective in controlling blood glucose levels in Type 1 Diabetics who perform prolonged strenuous exercise. The use of insulin pump technology in regions with hot Mediterranean climates is safe and can provide protection against exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Development of precise instructions for T1DM who occasionally get involved in exercise activities , requires further studies.
