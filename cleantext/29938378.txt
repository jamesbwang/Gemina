  The immune responses , involved in recognition of cancer-specific antigens , are of particular interest as this may provide major leads towards developing new vaccines and antibody therapies against cancer. An effective treatment for cancer is still a challenge because there are many mechanisms through which the tumor cells can escape the host immune surveillance. Oxidative stress or respiratory burst which is host 's mechanism to kill the foreign particles is used as defense mechanism by the tumor cells. The tumor cells uses this oxidative stress to form neo-antigens which in turn makes them undetectable and can escape the host immune surveillance. The human lung carcinoma ( A549) cells were treated using 100 ÂµM H
