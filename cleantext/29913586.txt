  To date , studies on the mobility of arsenic ( As) in soil amended with biochar have primarily relied on broad empirical observations , resulting in a gap between the behavior of As in amended soil and the chemical mechanisms controlling that behavior. This study focuses on the influence of abiotic factors in As mobility in As-contaminated soils amended with biochar. In order to understand the leaching of DOC and phosphate across a range of biomass feedstock and pyrolysis temperature , rice straw and granular sludge from an anaerobic digester were pyrolyzed at 300 , 550 , and 700 Â°C , and subjected to leaching studies by mixing air dried soil with 10 wt % of biochar at a soil: water ratio of 1:1 ( w/v). The concentration of DOC in the presence of granular sludge biochar and rice straw biochar increased from 190 mg L
