  The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between the fracture-risk assessment tool ( FRAX 速)- based intervention strategy in Turkey and the recommendations published in the Healthcare Practices Statement ( HPS). This descriptive cross-sectional study included individuals aged 40 to 90 years who were previously diagnosed as having osteoporosis but had not received any treatment. The intervention thresholds recommended by the National Osteoporosis Foundation for treatment were used. The criteria necessary for the start of administration of pharmacological agents in osteoporosis treatment were evaluated on the basis of the HPS guidelines. Of the 1,255 patients evaluated , 161 ( 12.8 %) were male and 1,094 ( 87.2 %) were female. In the evaluation , according to HPS , treatment was recommended for 783 patients ( 62.4 %; HPS +) and not recommended for 472 ( 37.6 %; HPS-). Of the 783 HPS + patients , 391 ( 49.9 %) were FRAX + , and of the 472 HPS- patients , 449 ( 95.1 %) were FRAX-. A statistically significant difference was observed between the treatment recommendations of HPS and FRAX 速 ( The FRAX 速 model has different treatment recommendation rates from the HPS. The agreement between the two is at a minimal level. However , as age increased , so did the agreement between the FRAX 速 and the HPS treatment recommendations. In the recommendation to start pharmacological treatment primarily based on age , non-medical interventions that preserve bone density should be evaluated.
