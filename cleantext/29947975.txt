  We have been using a combination of fludarabine/busulfan plus low-dose total body irradiation ( TBI) as the reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC) regimen for patients age â‰¥ 60 years undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) for myeloid malignancies. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 116 older patients ( median age 64 years) who underwent HCT from 2006 to 2015 for myeloid malignancies , including acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) in first complete remission ( CR1). On univariate analysis , overall survival ( OS) for the cohort at 3 years was 33 % ( 95 % CI 25-42). Cumulative incidence of relapse ( CIR) and non-relapse mortality ( NRM) at 3 years were 24 % ( 95 % CI 16-32) and 43 % ( 95 % CI 34-52) , respectively. Multivariable analysis for OS demonstrated AML patients to have superior outcome ( HR 1.60 for other myeloid , 95 % CI 1.01-2.54 , p = 0.045) , as well as related donors ( HR 1.92 for unrelated , 95 % CI 1.22-3.03 , p = 0.005). For NRM , AML patients had superior outcome ( HR 1.76 for other myeloid , 95 % CI 1.03-3.01 , p = 0.038) , as well as patients with related donors ( HR 1.81 for unrelated , 95 % CI 1.07-3.07 , p = 0.028). We then demonstrated that AML patients with related donors ( n = 45) had superior 3-year OS of 51 % ( 95 % CI 36-65) , compared to 21 % ( 95 % CI 12-32) for all other patients ( p = 0.0003). We conclude that the RIC regimen used is effective for older patients , particularly AML patients in CR1 with matched related donors.
