  Low-grade gliomas ( LGG) are slow-growing primary brain tumors that typically affect young adults. Advanced age is widely recognized as a poor prognostic factor in LGG. The impact of age on postoperative outcome in this patient group has not been systemically studied. We performed a nationwide register-based study with data from the Swedish Brain Tumor Registry ( SBTR) for all adults diagnosed with a supratentorial LGG ( WHO grade II astrocytoma , oligoastrocytoma , or oligodendroglioma) during 2005-2015. Patient- and tumor-related characteristics , postoperative complications , and survival were compared between three different age groups ( 18-39 years , 40-59 years , and ≥ 60 years). We identified 548 patients; 204 patients ( 37.2 %) aged 18-39 years , 227 patients ( 41.4 %) aged 40-59 years , and 117 patients ( 21.4 %) ≥ 60 years of age. Unfavorable preoperative prognostic factors ( eg , functional status and neurological deficit) were more common with increased age ( P < .001). In addition , overall survival was significantly impaired in those 60 years and above ( P < .001). We observed a clear dose-response for age with separation of survival curves at 50 years. Biopsy was more common in patients ≥ 60 years ( P < .001). Subgroup analysis of patients with resection revealed a higher amount of postoperative neurological deficits in older patients ( P = .029). In general , older patients with LGG have several unfavorable prognostic factors compared with younger patients but seem to tolerate surgery in a comparable fashion. However , more neurological deficits were observed following resections in elderly. Our data further support a cutoff at 50 years rather than 40 years for selection of high-risk patients.
