  Greater physical activity is associated with a decrease in risk of colorectal cancer for the general population; however , little is known about its relationship with colorectal cancer risk for people with Lynch syndrome<disease> , carriers of inherited pathogenic mutations in genes affecting DNA mismatch repair ( MMR). We studied a cohort of 2,042 MMR gene mutations carriers ( n = 807 , diagnosed with colorectal cancer) , from the Colon Cancer Family Registry. Self-reported physical activity in three age-periods ( 20-29 , 30-49 , and ≥ 50 years) was summarized as average metabolic equivalent of task hours per week ( MET-h/week) during the age-period of cancer diagnosis or censoring ( near-term exposure) , and across all age-periods preceding cancer diagnosis or censoring ( long-term exposure). Weighted Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio ( HR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) for the association between physical activity and colorectal cancer risk. Near-term physical activity was associated with a small reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer ( HR ≥ 35 vs. < 3.5 MET-h/week , 0.71; 95 % CI , 0.53- 0.96). The strength and direction of associations were similar for long-term physical activity , although the associations were not nominally significant. Our results suggest that physical activity is inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer for people with Lynch syndrome<disease> , however , further confirmation is warranted. The potential modifying effect of physical activity on colorectal cancer risk for people with Lynch syndrome<disease> could be useful for risk prediction and support counseling advice for lifestyle modification to reduce cancer risk.
