  The aim of our study was to compare the characteristics and prognosis between right- and left-sided metastatic colorectal carcinomas. Data from 937 patients with stage IV colorectal carcinomas ( synchronous distant metastasis) who had a resection of the primary tumour between 1985 and 2014 were analysed. Carcinomas in the caecum to transverse colon were defined as right-sided ( n = 250; 26.7 %). They were compared to tumours located from the splenic flexure to the rectum categorised as left-sided ( n = 687; 73.3 %). In right-sided carcinomas , we observed significantly more female patients ( 50.8 vs 36.2 %; p < 0.001) , more unfavourable histological types ( 24.0 vs 8.6 %; p < 0.001) , more M1c carcinomas ( metastases to the peritoneum Â± others; 32.0 vs 14.4 %; p < 0.001) and more emergencies ( 11.6 vs 7.1 %; p = 0.029) , while multimodal treatment was utilised in fewer patients ( 51.6 vs 63.8 %; p = 0.001) and curative resections were less frequently ( 24.1 vs 35.4 %; p = 0.002). Prognosis was significantly worse in patients with right-sided carcinomas ( 2-year-survival 27.2 vs 44.6 % , p < 0.01). This difference was more pronounced after R2 resection ( 15.3 vs 29.7 %; p < 0.001) , than after macroscopic curative resection ( 2-year-survival 63.9 vs 71.9 %; p = 0.106). In multivariate Cox regression analysis , tumour site was found to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival ( HR 1.2; 95 % CI 1.0-1.5; p = 0.012). During the three 10-year periods , the prognosis improved equally in patients with right- and left-sided carcinomas , while the differences in survival remained identical. In a surgical patient cohort undergoing primary tumour resection , significant differences in prognosis were observed between patients with metastatic right- and left-sided colorectal carcinomas.
