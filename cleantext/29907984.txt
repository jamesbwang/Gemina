  Polη , a unique TLS DNA polymerase that promotes efficient bypass of UV-induced CPDs and cisplatin adducts , has not been explored in Candida species yet. Here we show that CaPolη plays a vital role in protecting Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> genome from diverse array of DNA damaging agents , not limited to UV and cisplatin. Polη deficient strain did not exhibit any hyphal development in the presence of UV and cisplatin while the wild type strain profusely developed DNA damage induced filamentation. The polarized growth induced by HU and MMS was found to be Polη independent. No common regulatory pathway of morphogenesis operates in C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> due to genomic stress , rather Polη branches away from RAD53 dependent pathway to be specific to UV/cisplatin. Interestingly , serum that does not inflict any DNA damage also induces hyphal growth in C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , and requires a functionally active Polη. Importantly , deletion of RAD30 sensitized the strain to amphotericin B; but its presence resulted in azole drug tolerance only in DNA damaging conditions. We suggest that the roles of CaPolη in genome stability and genotoxins induced filamentation are due to its TLS activities; whereas its TLS independent functions play a vital role in serum induced morphogenesis and amphotericin B resistance.
