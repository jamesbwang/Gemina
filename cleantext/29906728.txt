  The main aim of this research was to assess the effects of municipal solid waste compost ( MSWC) addition to a burnt and unburnt calcareous soil , on the distribution of soil P forms in particle-size and extractable fractions. Three MSWC doses ( 1 , 2 and 4 % w/w) were added to burnt and unburnt soil samples and were incubated for 92 days at 29 Â°C and 75 % of field capacity moisture. A particle-size fractionation followed by a sequential P extraction procedure was carried out. The burnt soil showed significantly lower concentrations of organic P forms ( P
