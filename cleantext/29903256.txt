  To explore the regulation mechanism of coal tar pitch smoke extracts ( CTPE) on tumor necrosis<symptom> factor receptor-associated factor 2 ( TRAF2) mRNA expression in co-cultured model of human monocytes ( THP-1) and BEAS-2B cells. The co-cultured THP-1 and BEAS-2B cells were simulated by 3 μg/m L CTPE. The cells at passage 9 were treated with tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) neutralization antibody and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK) inhibitors SP600125 , and continued toculture at passage 15 ( neutralizing antibody group) and established the BEAS-2B cells of same generation as control group. The expression of TRAF2 mRNA was detected by realtime fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of TRAF2 mRNA and c-Jun mRNA in different groups of TNF-α neutralization antibody and JNK kinase inhibitors SP600125 groups were decreased compared with CC10 , respectively the groups of 48h ( 0. 19 ± 0. 02) and 36h ( 0. 03 ± 0. 02) were lowest. The expression of TRAF2 mRNA in groups of TNF-α neutralization antibody and JNK kinase inhibitors SP600125 groups ( respectively 1. 73 ± 0. 04 and 1. 88 ± 0. 05) were both significantly increased compared with control group ( 1. 07 ± 0. 06) , and lower than CC15 ( 2. 23 ± 0. 09). THP-1 could up-regulate the expression of TRAF2 mRNA through TNF-α in the BEAS-2B cells stimulated by CTPE , and there maybe negative feedback effect between TRAF2 and AP-1.
