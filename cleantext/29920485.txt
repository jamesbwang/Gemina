  Squamous cell carcinoma of mucosal sites in the head and neck ( HNSCC) is the sixth most common cause of cancer worldwide , and despite advances in conventional management , it still has significant morbidity and mortality associated with both diagnosis and treatment. Advances in our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying this disease have demonstrated a significant difference between human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>)- associated , HPV<pathogen> and tobacco associated , and HPV-negative disease. It remains important to further elucidate the biologic and genetic differences between HPV-associated and tobacco-associated disease , with the aim of earlier diagnosis through screening , and advances in management including the development of novel therapeutic agents. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are small , non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression , and have effects on almost every cellular function , and have potentially important applications to diagnosis , management and prognosis in HNSCC. Establishing a cellular miRNA expression profile for HPV-associated disease may therefore have important implications for the screening and treatment of this disease. This review summarises the current findings regarding miRNA expression in mucosal HNSCC , and focuses particularly on miRNA expression in HPV-associated tumours.
