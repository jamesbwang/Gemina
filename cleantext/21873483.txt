  Microorganisms display diverse biogeographic patterns in the three-dimensional contiguous seawater. The distance-decay relationship , the change in species composition similarity between different communities over a geographic distance , is a commonly observed biogeographic pattern. To study biogeographic patterns and the corresponding driving forces , the bacterial distance-decay patterns along the horizontal and vertical dimensions in the South China Sea ( SCS) were investigated through the sequencing of partial 16 S rRNA gene regions. Along the horizontal geographical distances ( up to ~ 1000 km) , no significant distance-decay pattern in community compositions was observed in any of the tested seawater layers. However , vertical depths ( up to ~ 4 km) had strong effects on bacterial community variation , which was apparently governed by dispersal barriers due to limited water mass mixing. In addition , community variations in the vertical direction were strongly correlated with the prominent variation of environmental factors. Apparently , the changes in bacterial community compositions along vertical distances were much greater than those along horizontal distances. The results showed that the distance-decay relationship in bacterial communities at the medium spatial scale was associated with vertical depth rather than with horizontal distance , even though the horizontal distance is much larger than the vertical distance in the open SCS.
