  The magnitudes , spatial distributions and contributions to global carbon budget of the global carbonate carbon sink ( CCS) still remain uncertain , allowing the problem of national measurement of CCS remain unresolved which will directly influence the fairness of global carbon markets and emission trading. Here , based on high spatiotemporal resolution ecological , meteorological raster data and chemical field monitoring data , combining highly reliable machine learning algorithm with the thermodynamic dissolution equilibrium model , we estimated the new CCS of 0.89 Â± 0.23 petagrams of carbon per year ( Pg C yr
