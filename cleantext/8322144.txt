  Massive gastrointestinal bleeding after corrosive intake is a rare complication that generally mandates a surgical intervention for control. Angioembolization for control of gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of acute corrosive injury has not been described. Here , we present our experience of a case of acute corrosive injury presenting with massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the delayed phase which was successfully managed by angioembolization. We discuss the case in light of the literature available and describe markers which may serve to identify potential candidates for angioembolization.
