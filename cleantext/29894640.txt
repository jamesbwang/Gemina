  Phospholipids and sterols play multiple roles in cells. In addition to establishing barriers between compartments , they also provide the matrix for assembly and function of a large variety of catalytic processes. Lipid composition is a highly regulated feature of biological membranes<symptom> , yet its implications for membrane proteins are difficult problems to approach. One obstacle is the inherent complexity of observing and describing these interactions and their dynamics at a molecular and atomic level. However , lipid interactions are pivotal for membrane protein function and should be acknowledged. The enzymatic activity of several different P-type ATPases , one of the major families of ion pumping primary active transporters , has previously been shown to exhibit a strong dependence on phospholipids; however , distinguishing the effects of annular and specific lipid interactions is challenging. Here we show that the hydrolytic activity of a bacterial Cu ( I)- transporting P-type ATPase ( LpCopA) is stimulated by the bacterial , anionic phospholipid cardiolipin and to some extent by phosphatidylglycerol. Furthermore , multiscale molecular dynamics simulations pinpoint lipid hot spots on the membrane-spanning domain of LpCopA. Thus , using two independent methods , our study shows converging evidence that the lipid membrane composition plays an important role for LpCopA.
