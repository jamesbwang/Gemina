  Ultraviolet ( UV) irradiation damages skin and produces symptoms of photoaging , such as thickening , rough texture , wrinkles , and pigmentation. However , the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying photoaging induced by chronic UV irradiation are not yet fully understood. Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs) have been reported to be involved in the response to UV irradiation. In this study , we examined the effects of the sunscreen agent Octylmethoxycinnamate ( OMC) on photoaging of the skin induced by chronic UV exposure in hairless albino Crl: SKH1-
