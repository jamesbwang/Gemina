  Carbon nanotubes ( CNTs) have near unity infrared ( IR) absorption efficiency , making them extremely attractive in IR imaging devices. Since CNT growth occurs at elevated temperatures , integration of CNTs with IR imaging devices is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Here we show a strategy for implementing CNTs as IR absorbers using differential heating of thermally-isolated microbolometer membranes<symptom> in a C
