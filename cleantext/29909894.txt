  The aim of the study was to compare multifocal extracapsular dissection with complete parotidectomy in the treatment of unilateral multifocal cystadenolymphomas of the parotid<symptom> gland. The records from all patients treated for unilateral multifocal cystadenolymphomas of the parotid<symptom> gland at a tertiary referral center between 2000 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. 203 patients were included in the study. 96 patients were managed by multifocal extracapsular dissection , 107 patients underwent complete parotidectomy. Metachronous tumors were detected in 7 cases ( 3.4 %) with a significant difference in the occurrence rate between multifocal extracapsular dissection ( 7/96 , 7.3 %) and complete parotidectomy ( 0/107 , 0 %) ( p = 0.004). Permanent facial palsy was significantly more common after complete parotidectomy ( 21/107 , 19.6 %) than multifocal extracapsular dissection ( 2/96 , 2.1 %) ( p = 0.000). The functional benefit of multifocal extracapsular dissection was counterbalanced by the advantage of complete parotidectomy , in terms of recurrences. Extracapsular dissection is at its limit in cases of multifocal cystadenolymphomas and the indication for it should be thoroughly verified in each and every case.
