  We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) comparing patent foramen ovale<disease> ( PFO) closure , anticoagulation , and antiplatelet therapy to prevent stroke recurrence in patients with PFO-associated cryptogenic stroke. We searched Medline , Cochrane Library , and EMBASE through March 2018. The primary outcome was stroke recurrence. Pooled incidences , hazard ratios , and risk ratios ( RRs) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses. PFO closure was associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke compared with antithrombotic therapy ( antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation: 3560 patients from 6 RCTs; RR = 0.36 , 95 % CI: 0.17-0.79; I PFO closure is superior to antithrombotic therapy to prevent stroke recurrence after cryptogenic stroke. The annual absolute risk reduction of stroke was low , but it has to be tempered by a substantial time at risk ( at least 5 years) in young and middle-aged patients. PFO closure was associated with an increased risk of
