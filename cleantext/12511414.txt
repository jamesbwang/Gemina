  Hodgkin Lymphoma ( HL) is a unique disease entity both in its pathology and the young patient population that it primarily affects. Although cure rates are high , survivorship can be linked with significant recent long-term morbidity associated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The most significant advances have been with the use of the anti-CD30-drug conjugated antibody brentuximab vedotin ( BV) and inhibitors of program death 1 ( PD-1). HL is genetically wired to up-regulate program death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) in > 95 % of cases , creating a state of so-called & ldquo; T cell exhaustion<symptom> & rdquo; , which can be reversed with immune checkpoint-inhibitor blockade. The overall and complete response rates to PD-1 inhibitors in patients with relapsed or refractory HL are 70 % and 20 % , respectively , with a long median duration of response of ~ 16 months. In fact , PD-1 inhibitors can benefit a wide spectrum of relapsed HL patients , including some who have & ldquo; progressive disease & rdquo; by strict response criteria. We review the biology of HL , with a focus on the immune micro-environment and mechanisms of immune evasion. We also provide the rationale supporting the use of PD-1 inhibitors in HL and highlight some of the challenges of monitoring disease response in patients treated with this immunotherapy.
