  To facilitate selective and enhanced drug delivery to hepsin ( Hpn)- expressing cancer cells , RIPL peptide ( IPLVVPLRRRRRRRRC , 16-mer)- conjugated nanostructured lipid carriers ( RIPL-NLCs) were developed. NLCs were prepared using a solvent emulsification-evaporation method and the RIPL peptide was conjugated to the maleimide-derivatized NLCs via the thiol-maleimide reaction. Employing a fluorescent probe ( DiI) , in vitro target-selective intracellular uptake behaviors were observed using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Separately , docetaxel ( DTX) was encapsulated by pre-loading technique , then cytotoxicity and drug release were evaluated. In vivo antitumor efficacy was investigated in BALB/c nude mice with SKOV3 cell tumors after intratumoral injections of different DTX formulations at a dose equivalent to 10 mg/kg DTX. RIPL-NLCs showed positively charged nanodispersion , whereas NLCs were negatively charged. DTX was successfully encapsulated with an encapsulation efficiency and drug loading capacity of 95-98 % and 44-46 Âµg/mg , respectively. DTX release was diffusion-controlled , revealing the best fit to the Higuchi equation. Cellular uptake of DiI-loaded RIPL-NLCs was 8.3- and 6.2-fold higher than that of DiI-loaded NLCs , in Hpn ( +) SKOV3 and LNCaP cells , respectively. The translocation of RIPL-NLCs into SKOV3 cells was time-dependent with internalization within 1 h and distribution throughout the cytoplasm after 2 h. DTX-loaded RIPL-NLCs ( DTX-RIPL-NLCs) revealed dose-dependent in vitro cytotoxicity , while drug-free formulations were non-cytotoxic. In SKOV3-bearing xenograft mouse model , DTX-RIPL-NLCs significantly inhibited tumor growth: the inhibition ratios of the DTX solution-treated and DTX-RIPL-NLC-treated groups were 61.4 % and 91.2 % , respectively , compared to those of the saline-treated group ( control). RIPL-NLCs are good candidates for Hpn-selective drug targeting with a high loading capacity of hydrophobic drug molecules.
