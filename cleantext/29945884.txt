  Cell walls surround all plant cells , and their composition and structure are modified in a tightly controlled , adaptive manner to meet sometimes opposing functional requirements during growth and development. The plant cell wall integrity ( CWI) maintenance mechanism controls these functional modifications , as well as responses to cell wall damage ( CWD). We investigated how the CWI system mediates responses to CWD in
