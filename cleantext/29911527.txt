  Basal cell carcinoma of the buttock is rare , and only 28 patients have been described. An extensive literature search was performed on basal cell carcinoma and buttock using the PubMed database. The literature was evaluated , and the characteristics of individuals with basal cell carcinoma of the buttock were summarized. The calculated prevalence of basal cell carcinoma of the buttock was 0.35 %. The majority of patients had no obvious basal cell carcinoma-associated risk factors. Carcinomas were observed 1.2 times more often in women than in men , and more often on the right buttock. They frequently presented as an asymptomatic nodule<disease>. The buttock tumor was typically associated with a nodular histologic subtype of basal cell carcinoma. The prognosis for these patients was excellent after complete removal of the tumor. In conclusion , basal cell carcinoma of the buttock is a rare clinical variant of this type of skin cancer that usually presented as an asymptomatic nodule<disease> in an individual who did not have any traditional risk factors for this malignancy. The cancer was typically associated with a nonaggressive histologic subtype. Recurrence or metastasis was not observed after treatment of the primary tumor.
