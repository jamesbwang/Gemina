  Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities ( IDD) are at a high risk for engaging in self-injurious behavior ( SIB). Prognosis is poor when SIB emerges early. Limited research exists on interventions teaching parents how to manage their young child 's SIB. This investigation assessed the feasibility of adapting an applied behavior analytic parent training program with 11 parents of children 1-5 years of age with IDD and SIB. Quantitative and observational measures were used to assess outcomes; semi-structured interviews assessed caregiver satisfaction. Outcomes yielded preliminary data suggesting the adapted curriculum was feasible and acceptable to parents. Initial efficacy outcomes yielded decreases in SIB and observed negative parent-child interactions on pre- and post-measures. Qualitative data provided areas for further curriculum refinement.
