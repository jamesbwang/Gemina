  Anti-tumor immunity modulates the local effects of radiation therapy. High mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1) plays a pivotal role in activating antigen-specific T-cell responses. Here , we examined the relationship between linear energy transfer ( LET) and HMGB1 release. We assessed the proportions of KYSE-70 , HeLa and SiHa cells surviving after carbon-ion ( C-ion) beam irradiation with different LET values , using a clonogenic assay. The D10 , the dose at which 10 % of cells survived , was calculated using a linear-quadratic model. HMGB1 levels in the culture supernatants of C-ion beam-irradiated tumor cells were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The D10 doses for 13 keV/μm of C-ion irradiation in KYSE-70 , HeLa and SiHa cells were 2.8 , 3.9 and 4.1 Gy , respectively , whereas those for 70 keV/μm C-ion irradiation were 1.4 , 1.9 and 2.3 Gy , respectively. We found that 70 keV/μm of C-ion irradiation significantly increased HMGB1 levels in the culture supernatants of all cell lines 72 h after irradiation compared with non-irradiated controls. Furthermore , 70 keV/μm of C-ion irradiation significantly increased HMGB1 levels in the culture supernatants of all cell lines 72 h after irradiation compared with 13 keV/μm. The results suggest that HMGB1 release from several cancer cell lines increases with increased LET.
