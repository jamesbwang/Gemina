  To investigate the situation of dissuading smoking and related factors among the employees of public places. By using a purposive sampling method , six national non-communicable disease control and prevention demonstrationareas , including Chongan , Rushan , Hanyang , Shouyang , Beibei and Huzhu District ( County) , were selected as the study sites from different geographic locations of eastern , central or western China , and urban or rural resident places. Staff from three public places such as medical care settings , government agencies and restaurants were interviewed through face to face. Information about demographics , situation of smoking and secondhand smoke , smoking dissuading , and smoking sings and smoking policies of the selected public places were collected. Totally 1629 qualified questionnaires were collected from staff of medical care settings ( 1029) , government agencies ( 187) and restaurants ( 413). Of all the participants , 9. 39 % were current smokers , and 64. 97 % reported exposed to secondhand smoke in the past 30 days. Among the 1629 participants , 75. 57 % reported they would dissuade the smokers in their workplace , while 14. 30 % and10. 13 % of the participants indicated they would avoid the smokers or indifferent respectively. Univariate analysis showed that public place category , gender , age , education level , current smoking situation , smoking signs were statistically significantly associated with smoking dissuading ( P < 0. 05) , while geographic locations , place of residence , income level and knowledge score were not ( P > 0. 05). Logistic regression analysis showed that compared to workers from medical care settings , workers from government agencies were less likely to dissuade ( OR = 0. 212 , 95 % CI 0. 150 ~ 0. 301) , while workers from restaurants more likely to dissuade ( OR = 1. 842 , 95 % CI 1. 117-3. 038). Staff aged 35 years old or above more likely to dissuade ( OR = 1. 474 , 95 % CI1. 142-1. 903). Workers of present smokers were less likely to dissuade than those of nonsmokers ( OR = 0. 465 , 95 % CI 0. 309-0. 700). Workers of public places with smokefree policies more likely to dissuade than those from public places without ( OR = 1. 649 , 95 % CI 1. 160-2. 344). Most of the staff of public places reported they would dissuade smokers. Workers of nonsmokers , aged 35 years old or above and those from public places with smoke-free policy were positive factors to smoking dissuading.
