  To examine the feasibility of a new open-area body<symptom> weight support system ( BWSS) to act as both an `` assistive '' and a `` rehabilitative '' device within the home. A 5-year-old boy with spina bifida used the BWSS during self-selected activities for 10 weeks. Feasibility , behavioral , and clinical assessments provided a quantification of his activity in and out of the BWSS. On average , the child used the device on 2.7 days/week and for 67 minutes/day during intervention. When in the BWSS ( assistive role) , the child 's locomotor activity and engagement in adapted sports activities increased. When not in the BWSS ( rehabilitative role) , the child 's functional mobility and ambulatory ability increased. The use of the open-area in-home BWSS was feasible for regular home use and associated with an increase in functional mobility for a child with spina bifida.
