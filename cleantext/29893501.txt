  The deep origin and early evolution of seed plants ( spermatophytes) are poorly understood. Starting in the Early Devonian , euphyllophytes diversified rapidly into several groups. Two of these groups , progymnospems and Stenokoleales , along with satellite taxa , have been involved in discussions of seed plant origins. Because these early lineages are extinct , the key to the origin and early evolution of seed plants lies in the fossil record. Decades-long paleobotanical work has produced data on the diversity and anatomy of fossil species , which now provide a foundation for exploring seed plant origins in a phylogenetic context. We address phylogenetic relationships between early seed plants , aneurophytalean progymnosperms , Stenokoleales , and several Devonian species of uncertain affinities using parsimony analyses that include 28 anatomically preserved species ( the most comprehensive taxon sampling to date) and 49 morphoanatomical characters ( including nine continuous characters). Our analyses recover monophyletic seed plants , Stenokoleales , and aneurophytes , with the latter placed as sister to a clade ( termed the bilateral clade) that includes the former two. When added in the analysis , continuous characters based on anatomy improve phylogenetic resolution. Our results support the groups defined by traditional taxonomy , resolve Stenokoleales nested among the lignophytes , and indicate that seed plants may share a closer ancestor with Stenokoleales than with aneurophytes. Additionally , our trees suggest a Givetian minimum age for the seed plant ancestor , a late Emsian minimum age for the Stenokoleales , and early Emsian minimum ages for lignophytes , the bilateral clade , and the aneurophyte ancestor.
