  A growing body of evidence demonstrates that the brain can reorganize dramatically following sensory<symptom> loss<symptom>. Although the existence of such neuroplastic crossmodal changes is not in doubt , the functional significance of these changes remains unclear. The dominant belief is that reorganization is compensatory. However , results thus far do not unequivocally indicate that sensory deprivation results in markedly enhanced abilities in other senses. Here , we consider alternative reasons besides sensory compensation that might drive the brain to reorganize after sensory<symptom> loss<symptom>. One such possibility is that the cortex reorganizes not to confer functional benefits , but to avoid undesirable physiological consequences of sensory deafferentation. Empirical assessment of the validity of this and other possibilities defines a rich program for future research.
