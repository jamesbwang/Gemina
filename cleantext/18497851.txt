  Improving surface sensitivities of nanostructure-based plasmonic sensors is an important issue to be addressed. Among the SPR measurements , the wavelength interrogation is commonly utilized. We proposed using blue-shifted surface plasmon mode and Fano resonance , caused by the coupling of a cavity mode ( angle-independent) and the surface plasmon mode ( angle-dependent) in a long-periodicity silver nanoslit array , to increase surface ( wavelength) sensitivities of metallic nanostructures. It results in an improvement by at least a factor of 4 in the spectral shift as compared to sensors operated under normal incidence. The improved surface sensitivity was attributed to a high refractive index sensitivity and the decrease of plasmonic evanescent field caused by two effects , the Fano coupling and the blue-shifted resonance. These concepts can enhance the sensing capability and be applicable to various metallic nanostructures with periodicities.
