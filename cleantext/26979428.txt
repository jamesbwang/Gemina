  Succinylation is a post-translational protein acylation modification that converts the cationic lysine side chain to an anion with large potential impacts on protein structure and function. Here we characterize the epigenome-wide distribution of succinyllysine marks in chromatin using chromatin immuno-precipitation sequencing ( ChIP-seq). We estimate that more than one-third of all nucleosomes contain lysine succinylation marks and demonstrate a potential role of chromatin succinylation in modulating gene expression. We further demonstrate that defective tricarboxylic acid ( TCA) cycle metabolism perturbs the succinyllysine distribution in chromatin , correlating with transcriptional responses. This is consistent with previous observations linking nucleosome succinylation with enhanced
