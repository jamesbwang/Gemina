  Thyrotropin-secreting adenoma ( TSHoma) is rare. Even though the thyrotoxicosis is mild in patients with TSHoma , it is still a rare cause of arrhythmia , ignore of mild disfunction of thyroid function of TSHoma can lead to the delayed diagnosis of pituitary tumor or leading to recurring of complications. Graves ' disease is an auto-immue endocrinological disorder. Association of TSHoma and Graves 's disease is extremely rare. Coexistence of these two diseases made the diagnosis and treatment complicated. This patient was a 55-year-old man who had been referred to the department of endocrinology and metabolism of the West China Hospital due to recurrent atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) and thyroxicosis. Examinations revealed pituitary thyrotropin-secreting macroadenoma with Graves ' disease. We conducted transsphenoidal surgery. Thyrozol was used to treat the recurrence of Graves ' disease after pituitary surgery. The TSHoma was successfully cured , and recurrent Graves ' disease was controlled very well. The association of TSHoma and Graves ' disease is extremely rare. Even though the clinical features of thyrotoxicosis are milder in patients with TSHoma , thyroid function tests are still important clinical assessment of patients with AF , which is an arrhythmia associated with hyperthyroidism. TSHoma is a rare cause of thyrotoxicosis; however , ignoring of the mild disfunction caused by TSHoma can lead to the delayed diagnosis of pituitary tumors or to recurring of complications of TSHoma.
