  Spermatogenesis is a complex process controlled by a plethora of genes. Changes in expression and function of these genes may thus lead to spermatogenic deficiency and male infertility<symptom>. TEX11 , TEX12 , TEX14 and TEX15 are germ cell-specific genes expressed in the testis. TEX11 , involved in the initiation and maintenance of chromosome synapses in meiotic chromosomes , has been shown to be essential for meiosis and fertility in males. TEX14 , a component of intercellular bridges in germ cells , is required for spermatogenesis and fertility. TEX12 and TEX15 are essential for correct assembly of the synaptonemal complex and thus meiosis progression. In order to examine whether changes in expression of these genes is associated with impaired spermatogenesis , expression levels of these genes were quantified by RT-qPCR on samples retrieved from infertile patients submitted to diagnostic testicular biopsy at Royan institute. Samples were divided into two groups of 18 patients with non-obstructive azoospermia considered as case; nine patients with obstructive azoospermia were included in the control group. A significant down-regulation of these genes was observed in the SCOS group when compared to the control group. This result suggests that regular expression of TEX11 , TEX12 , TEX14 and TEX15 is essential for the early stages of spermatogenesis.
