  Exploring materials with regulated local structures and understanding how the atomic motifs govern the reactivity and durability of catalysts are a critical challenge for designing advanced catalysts. Herein we report the tuning of the local atomic structure of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides ( NiFe-LDHs) by partially substituting Ni
