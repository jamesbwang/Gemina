  To assess mid-term safety and efficacy of a modified Goel-Harms technique for the treatment of odontoid instabilities. Longitudinal prospective cohort study. Urban Level 1 Trauma Center in Southwest Germany. Orthopaedic and neurosurgical trauma patients older than 18 years admitted for â‰¤ 24 hours. The outcome was evaluated with respect to neurological outcome , radiological outcome and surgical complications. For the functional assessment the EQ-5D questionnaire was used. Furthermore the Neck Disability Index ( NDI) and Visual Analog Scale ( VAS) for neck<symptom> pain<symptom> were determined. A median follow-up of 39 months ( range 6- 97 months) was given. Of the total sample ( n = 56) , 26 patients with an acute traumatic odontoid fracture type II underwent posterior atlanto-axial instrumentation utilizing spinal navigation. Neck<symptom> pain<symptom> evaluated with VAS and NDI showed a significant decrease at final follow-up , compared to preoperative values ( p < 0.05). According to the EQ-5D , the valuation of quality of life after C1/C2 fusion showed an excellent outcome with complete recovery in the majority of cases ( 0.7- 1). Our results demonstrate satisfactory and maintained mid-term clinical and radiological results after a median follow-up of 39 months. With the use of intraoperative spinal navigation we demonstrate a modified C1/C2 posterior fusion technique , rendering accuracy , feasibility and overall safety. Therapeutic Level III.
