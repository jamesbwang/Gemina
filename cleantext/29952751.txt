  In this paper , we report the performance of 9-11-year-old children using a steady-state visual evoked potential ( SSVEP)- based brain-computer interface ( BCI) and provide control data collected from adults for comparison. Children in our study achieved a much higher performance ( 79 % accuracy; average age 9.64 years old) than the only previous investigation of children using an SSVEP-based BCI ( âˆ¼ 50 % accuracy; average age 9.86 years old). Experiments were conducted in two phases , a short calibration phase and a longer experimental phase. An offline analysis of the data collected during the calibration phase was used to set two parameters for a classifier and to screen participants who did not achieve a minimum accuracy of 85 %. Eleven of the 14 children and all 11 of the adults who completed the calibration phase met the minimum accuracy requirement. During the experimental phase , children selected targets with a similar accuracy ( 79 % for children versus 78 % for adults) , latency ( 2.1 s for children versus 1.9 s for adults) , and bitrate ( 0.50 bits s This study shows that children can use an SSVEP-based BCI with higher performance than previously believed and is the first to report the performance of children using an SSVEP-based BCI in terms of latency and bitrate. The results of this study imply that children with severe motor disabilities ( such as locked-in syndrome<disease>) may use an SSVEP-based BCI to restore/replace the ability to communicate.
