  A novel series of uridine glycoconjugates , derivatives of 4-aminophenyl 1-thioglycosides , was designed and synthesized. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antiviral activity against hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) and classical swine fever<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( CSFV) , two important human and animal viral pathogens for which new or improved therapeutic options are needed. The antiviral activity of all synthesized compounds was confirmed using pseudo-plaque reduction assays in which a significant arrest of CSFV and HCV<pathogen> growth was observed in the presence of these compounds. Two of the synthesized compounds ,
