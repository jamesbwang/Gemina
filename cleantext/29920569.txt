  Using biomacromolecule-based nanorods as a chiral source is a creative way to fabricate broadband chiroptically active nanoarchitectures. Herein , right-handedly twisted cellulose nanocrystal ( CNC) nanorods , serving simultaneously as a chiral template and a building block , were combined with CuO for constructing composite nanoflowers that showed broadband chiroptical activity. Through calcination , the CuO/CNC nanoflowers can transform into chiral CuO with a flower-like architecture. The established preparation technology is expected to provide various novel broadband chiroptically active nanoarchitectures originating from CNCs and metal oxides.
