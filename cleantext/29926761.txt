  The purpose of this integrative review was to explore the impact of prostate cancer ( PCa) on the quality of life ( QoL) and factors that contribute to the QoL for Black men with PCa. Prostate is recognized as the prevalent cancer among men in the United States. Compared to other men , Black men are diagnosed more frequently and with more advanced stages of PCa. Black men also experience disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality rates of PCa , among all racial and ethnic groups. The initial diagnosis of PCa is often associated with a barrage of concerns for one 's well-being including one 's QoL. As a result , men must contend with various psychosocial and physiological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> of PCa survivorship. Whittemore and Knafl 's integrative review method was utilized to examine empirical articles from the electronic databases of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL) , PsycINFO , PubMed , Project Muse , and Google Scholar. The time frame for the literature was January 2005 to December 2016. A synthesis of the literature yielded 18 studies that met the inclusion criteria for the integrative review. A conceptual framework that examined QoL among cancer survivors identified four domains that measured the QoL among Black PCa survivors: ( a) physical; ( b) psychological; ( c) social; and ( d) spiritual well-being. Social well-being was the dominant factor among the studies in the review , followed by physical , psychological , and spiritual. Results indicate the need for additional studies that examine the factors impacting the QoL among Black PCa survivors , using a theoretical framework so as to develop culturally appropriate interventions for Black PCa survivors.
