  Age-related changes in coordinated movement pattern of the thorax and pelvis may be one of the factors contributing to fall risk. This report describes the feasibility of using a new thoracopelvic assisted movement device to improve gait and balance<symptom> in an elderly population with increased risk for falls. In this case series , 19 older adults were recruited from an assisted living facility. All had gait difficulties ( gait speed < 1.0 m/s) and history of falls. Participants received 12 training sessions with the thoracopelvic assisted movement device. Functional performance was measured before , during ( after 6 sessions) , and after the 12 sessions. Outcomes measures were Timed Up and Go , Functional Reach Test , and the 10-meter Walk Test. Changes in outcomes were calculated for each participant in the context of minimal detectable change ( MDC) values. More than 25 % of participants showed changes > MDC in their clinical measures after 6 treatment sessions , and more than half improved > MDC after 12 sessions. Six subjects ( 32 %) improved their Timed Up and Go time by > 4 seconds after 6 sessions , and 10 ( 53 %) after 12 sessions. After the intervention , 4 subjects ( 21 %) improved their 10-meter Walk Test velocity from limited community ambulation ( 0.4-0.8 m/s) to functional community ambulation ( > 0.8 m/s). Thoracopelvic assisted movement training that mimics normal walking pattern may have clinical implications , by improving skills that enhance balance<symptom> and gait function. Additional randomized , controlled studies are required to examine the effects of this intervention on larger cohorts with a variety of subjects.
