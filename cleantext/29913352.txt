  The past few years of genetic research on primate quantitative trait variation have been notable in the diversity of phenotypes explored , ranging from classic skeletal measurements to behavior , through to levels of gene expression , and with observations from both captive and wild populations. These studies demonstrate the importance of captive pedigreed breeding colonies , populations that can be matched to their wild counterparts to enable comparison of genetic architectures. Non-human primate genotype: phenotype maps are essential for placing human variation within an evolutionary framework as well as for gaining insight to human biology. While the demographic history of most primates has been fairly stable since the Late Pleistocene , humans experienced a dramatic population expansion that increased the number of rare , mildly deleterious mutations. These rare genetic variants complicate the genotype: phenotype association because they account for a disproportionate amount of the genetic variance and are harder to detect. The similar physiologies of our closest living relatives may prove to be key for overcoming the hurdles posed by humans ' peculiar demographic explosion.
