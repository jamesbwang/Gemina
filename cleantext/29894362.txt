  A 72-year-old man with a dual-chamber implantable defibrillator was referred to our center for transvenous lead extraction because of pocket infection and presence of an abandoned lead. We decided to proceed with a video-assisted thoracoscopic approach because of patient history and documented complete occlusion of the right subclavian vein. During the use of excimer laser for persistent adhesions , the ventricular lead broke down at the level of cavoatrial junction. To successfully remove the remaining portion of lead , we decided to use the excimer laser by femoral route. A final angiography through the laser sheath showed the integrity of the myocardial wall. We report a case of laser-assisted transvenous lead extraction unconventionally performed by the femoral route. A preventive minimally invasive cardiac surgery was implemented to provide more safety in this high-risk procedure. This technique may avoid the need of a full sternotomy in case of major bleeding complications.
