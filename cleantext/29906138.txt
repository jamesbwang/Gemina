  We demonstrate an acoustical analog of a circuit quantum electrodynamics system that leverages acoustic properties to enable strong multimode coupling in the dispersive regime while suppressing spontaneous emission to unconfined modes. Specifically , we fabricate and characterize a device that comprises a flux tunable transmon coupled to a 300 Î¼m long surface acoustic wave resonator. For some modes , the qubit-cavity coupling reaches 6.5 MHz , exceeding the cavity loss rate ( 200 kHz) , qubit linewidth ( 1.1 MHz) , and the cavity free spectral range ( 4.8 MHz) , placing the device in both the strong coupling and strong multimode regimes. With the qubit detuned from the confined modes of the cavity , we observe that the qubit linewidth strongly depends on its frequency , as expected for spontaneous emission of phonons , and we identify operating frequencies where this emission rate is suppressed.
