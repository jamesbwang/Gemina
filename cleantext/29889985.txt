  Most microalgal species are geographically widespread , but little is known about how they are dispersed. One potential mechanism for long-distance dispersal is through birds , which may transport cells internally ( endozoochory) and deposit them during , or in-between , their migratory stopovers. We hypothesize that dinoflagellates , in particular resting stages , can tolerate bird digestion; that bird temperature , acidity , and retention time negatively affect dinoflagellate viability; and that recovered cysts<symptom> can germinate after passage through the birds ' gut , contributing to species-specific dispersal of the dinoflagellates across scales. Tolerance of two dinoflagellate species ( Peridiniopsis borgei , a warm-water species and Apocalathium malmogiense , a cold-water species) to Mallard gut passage was investigated using in vitro experiments simulating the gizzard and caeca conditions. The effect of in vitro digestion and retention time on cell integrity , cell viability , and germination capacity of the dinoflagellate species was examined targeting both their vegetative and resting stages. Resting stages ( cysts<symptom>) of both species were able to survive simulated bird gut passage , even if their survival rate and germination were negatively affected by exposure to acidic condition and bird internal temperature. Cysts<symptom> of A. malmogiense were more sensitive than P. borgei to treatments and to the presence of digestive enzymes. Vegetative cells did not survive conditions of bird internal temperature and formed pellicle cysts<symptom> when exposed to gizzard-like acid conditions. We show that dinoflagellate resting cysts<symptom> serve as dispersal propagules through migratory birds. Assuming a retention time of viable cysts<symptom> of 2-12 h to duck stomach conditions , cysts<symptom> could be dispersed 150-800 km and beyond.
