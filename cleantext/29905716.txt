  We present an integration of a single Ag nanowire ( NW) with a graphene photodetector and demonstrate an efficient and compact detection of long-range surface plasmon polaritons ( SPPs). Atomically thin graphene provides an ideal platform to detect the evanescent electric field of SPPs extremely bound at the interface of the Ag NW and glass substrate. Scanning photocurrent microscopy directly visualizes a polarization-dependent excitation and detects the SPPs. The SPP detection responsivity is readily controlled up to âˆ¼ 17 mA/W by the drain-source voltage. We believe that the graphene SPP detector will be a promising building block for highly integrated photonic and optoelectronic circuits.
