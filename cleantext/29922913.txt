  Epidemiological studies consistently report a 90 % prevalence of foot pain. Mechanical and other non-pharmacological interventions such as orthoses and footwear can play an important role in managing foot pathology in patients whose systemic<disease> disease<disease> is controlled. The effectiveness of treatment with insoles has been examined in various randomised controlled trials , which have reported immediate clinical improvements , with reduced foot pain and disability and enhanced functionality. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of foot orthoses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) , in comparison with other treatments , in terms of enhanced disability and reduced pain. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of a number of randomised controlled trials focusing on patients with RA. The search was conducted in Cochrane , CINAHL , PubMed , EMBASE , SCOPUS and Cuiden , by means of an independent peer review. The Mesh terms and fields used were foot , ankle , joint , RA , foot , orthosis , insole and foot orthosis. Of the initial 118 studies considered , 5 were included in the final systematic review and meta-analysis. These five studies had enrolled a total of 301 participants , with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 36 months. Although the use of orthoses seems to alleviate foot pain , our meta-analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences between control and intervention groups regarding long- and short-term pain relief and/or reduced disability. Foot orthoses can relieve pain and disability and enhance patients , but no significant differences were found between control and intervention groups.
