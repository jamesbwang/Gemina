  By using the commercially available ruthenium pincer complex ( Ru-MACHO-BH) as a catalyst , the challenging direct hydrogenation of lactams and analogues has been successfully accomplished to deliver corresponding value-added amino alcohols in good-to-excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Remarkably , in addition to N-protected lactams , unprotected ones could also be readily reduced in the presence of a catalytic amount of weak base or even under neutral reaction conditions , which further highlights the broad substrate scope and the protocol efficiency.
