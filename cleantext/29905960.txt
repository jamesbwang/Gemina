  Contents I. II. III. IV. V. References SUMMARY: Although the relationship between species diversity and biomass productivity has been extensively studied in grasslands , the impact of tree species diversity on forest<disease> productivity , as well as the main drivers of this relationship , are still under discussion. It is widely accepted that the magnitude of the relationship between tree diversity and forest<disease> stand productivity is context specific and depends on environmental conditions , but the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are still not fully understood. Competition reduction and facilitation have been identified as key mechanisms driving the diversity-productivity relationship. However , contrasting results have been reported with respect to the extent to which competition reduction and facilitation determine the diversity-productivity relationship. They appear to depend on regional climate , soil fertility , functional diversity of the tree species involved , and developmental stage of the forest<disease>. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge and to suggest a conceptual framework to explain the various processes leading to higher productivity of species-rich forests compared with average yields of their respective monocultures. This framework provides three pathways for possible development of the diversity-productivity relationship under a changing climate.
