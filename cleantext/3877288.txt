  We retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of propofol administration alone and in combination with midazolam for gag<symptom> reflex suppression during dental treatment under intravenous sedation. We included 56 patients with an overactive gag<symptom> reflex who were to undergo dental treatment under intravenous sedation. They were divided into propofol ( P group , n = 22) and midazolam with propofol ( MP group , n = 34) groups. The P group received propofol alone , while the MP group received midazolam ( 0.04 mg/kg) prior to target-controlled infusion ( TCI) of propofol ( titrated for adequate sedation). The patients ' anesthetic records were evaluated for vital sign changes , adverse cardiovascular or respiratory event frequency , the number of forced treatment interruptions , and the TCI-predicted cerebral propofol concentration at gag<symptom> reflex suppression ( posterior tongue stimulation with a dental mirror). No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups preoperatively. There were no cases of forced interruptions or significant respiratory compromise in either group. Cardiovascular adverse event frequency was lower in the MP group than in the P group ( all p < .05). Our results suggest that propofol , when combined with midazolam , minimized cardiovascular effects compared with propofol alone when used to suppress the gag<symptom> reflex in patients during dental treatment under intravenous sedation.
