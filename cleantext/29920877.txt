  The majority of studies included in recent reviews of impact for public and patient involvement ( PPI) in health research had a qualitative design. PPI in solely quantitative designs is underexplored , particularly its impact on statistical analysis. Statisticians in practice have a long history of working in both consultative ( indirect) and collaborative ( direct) roles in health research , yet their perspective on PPI in quantitative health research has never been explicitly examined. To explore the potential and challenges of PPI from a statistical perspective at distinct stages of quantitative research , that is sampling , measurement and statistical analysis , distinguishing between indirect and direct PPI. Statistical analysis is underpinned by having a representative sample , and a collaborative or direct approach to PPI may help achieve that by supporting access to and increasing participation of under-represented groups in the population. Acknowledging and valuing the role of lay knowledge of the context in statistical analysis and in deciding what variables to measure may support collective learning and advance scientific understanding , as evidenced by the use of participatory modelling in other disciplines. A recurring issue for quantitative researchers , which reflects quantitative sampling methods , is the selection and required number of PPI contributors , and this requires further methodological development. Direct approaches to PPI in quantitative health research may potentially increase its impact , but the facilitation and partnership skills required may require further training for all stakeholders , including statisticians.
