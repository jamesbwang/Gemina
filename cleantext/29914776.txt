  A French national study on infectious encephalitis<disease> enrolled 253 patients in 2007. Fifty-two per cent of patients had a proven etiological diagnosis; 16 % had bacterial encephalitis<disease>. We aimed to assess the predictive value of CSF lactate concentration to diagnose bacterial encephalitis<disease>. Patients from the 2007 cohort whose CSF lactate concentration was available were included. Clinical and biological features associated with a bacterial etiology were assessed using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. The ROC curve of CSF lactate concentration was used to define the most appropriate cut-off associated with bacterial etiology. Fifty-seven patients ( 37 men , 20 women) were included. Ten patients had bacterial encephalitis<disease> , 20 patients had viral encephalitis<disease>. The mean CSF white blood cells ( WBC) , protein , glucose , and lactate levels were respectively 92 cells/mm A high CSF lactate level seems to be a better predictor than WBC or proteins to differentiate bacterial encephalitis<disease> from other etiologies.
