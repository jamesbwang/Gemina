  There is international interest in how the availability of alcohol can be controlled to reduce harms. An objective of ` protecting and improving public health ' was introduced to alcohol premises licensing in Scotland in 2005 , resulting in public health actors engaging with licensing in new ways. We aimed to explore their experiences , including perceptions of the distribution of power , and constraints on their influence and that of the general public within the licensing system. In-depth , semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 public health actors who had recent and extensive experience of involvement in local licensing in 20 Scottish licensing jurisdictions. Interviews were audio-recorded and analysed using an inductive framework approach. Public health actors reported experiencing the licensing process as inherently unfair , with structures and traditions that were largely unhelpful to their efforts to support the public health objective. These included influence exerted by local officials , the formal and quasi-judicial conduct of licensing meetings , and the disparity in resources available to public health actors versus licence applicants-with many larger applicants engaging specialist lawyers to represent their interests. The influence of public opinion-through , for instance , elected representatives ' perceptions of public attitudes , consultation exercises and local ` licensing forums '- was seen as having a limited effect on decision-making. Changes to Scottish alcohol licensing ostensibly designed to enhance democratic engagement and promote public health , were as yet insufficient to change the system , or empower stakeholders , to fully achieve those goals.
