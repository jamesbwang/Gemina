  A series of concentrated aqueous solutions of ferric chloride with different chloride: iron ( III) ratios has been studied by means of EXAFS to determine the structure around the iron ( III) ion of the dominating species in such solutions. The dominating species in dilute acidic aqueous solution of ferric chloride , at less than 1 mmol Â· dm
