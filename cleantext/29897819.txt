  Lesions<symptom> of the anteroventral third ventricle ( AV3V region) are known to prevent many forms of experimental hypertension , including mineralocorticoid ( DOCA-salt) hypertension in the rat. However , AV3V lesions<symptom> include the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis ( OVLT) , portions of the median preoptic nucleus , as well as efferent fibers from the subfornical organ ( SFO) , thereby limiting the ability to define the individual contribution of these structures to the prevention of experimental hypertension. Having previously reported that the SFO does not play a significant role in the development of DOCA-salt hypertension , the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the OVLT is necessary for DOCA-salt hypertension in the rat. In uninephrectomized OVLT lesioned ( OVLTx; n = 6) and SHAM ( OVLTsham; n = 4) Sprague-Dawley rats consuming a 0.1 % NaCl diet and 0.9 % NaCl drinking solution , 24-hour mean arterial pressure ( MAP) was recorded telemetrically 5 days before and 21 days after DOCA implantation ( 100 mg/rat; SQ). No differences in control MAP were observed between groups. The chronic pressor response to DOCA was attenuated in OVLTx rats such that MAP increased to 133 ( plus minus) 3 mmHg in OVLTsham rats by Day 21 of DOCA compared to 120 ( plus minus) 4 mmHg in OVLTx rats. These results support the hypothesis that the OVLT is an important brain site of action for the pathogenesis of DOCA-salt hypertension in the rat.
