  To describe functional and histopathological findings after macular peeling using different dyes. Prospective , randomized , comparative , interventional , and immunohistochemical study. Forty-five eyes from 45 patients with idiopathic epiretinal membrane ( ERM) underwent pars plana chromovitrectomy with ERM and inner limiting membrane ( ILM) using trypan blue 0.15 % + brilliant blue 0.05 % + lutein 2 % in group 1 ( 15 eyes) , trypan blue 0.15 % + brilliant blue 0.025 % + polyethylene glycol 3350 4 % in group 2 ( 15 eyes) , and indocyanine green 0.05 % in group 3 ( 15 eyes). We evaluated visual acuity ( VA) and macular sensitivity ( MS) preoperatively , 1 , 3 , and 6 months after surgery. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP) and neurofilament protein ( NF) was assessed immunohistochemically on the ILMs peeled as markers of glial and neuronal cells. In group 1 , both mean VA and MS were significantly better at 1 and 3 months after surgery ( P < 0.05) , whereas no significant difference was found after 6 months. GFAP and NF expression was significantly lower in group 1 ( P < 0.05). The ERM/ILM peeling is thought to rip off the intraretinal tissue , based on the amounts of GFAP and NF in the specimens. The use of lutein dyes reduces iatrogenic stress to the retinal tissue and allows a faster functional recovery in the first 3 months after surgery , suggesting a less iatrogenic adhesion to the retinal tissue.
