  Introduction Hypoglycaemia is a clinical syndrome<disease> from various causes , which happens when the blood glucose concentration is too low. Many studies show that telemedicine intervention can improve glycemic control and has a positive impact on the management of diabetic patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of telemedicine intervention on hypoglycemic event occurrences and results on hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) and body mass index ( BMI). Methods We searched the Cochrane Library , PubMed , Web of Science , the EBSCO host , and OVID to identify relevant studies published from January 2006 to December 2017. The work of searching , selecting and assessing risk of bias was administrated by two independent reviewers. The primary outcomes were hypoglycemic event rate and HbA1c; the secondary outcome was BMI. Results From 1246 articles , we identified 14 eligible RCTs ( n = 1324). Compared to usual care , telemedicine was found to reduce the odds of hypoglycaemia ( odds ratio ( OR) = 0.42; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.29-0.59; I
