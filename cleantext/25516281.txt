  T cell receptor-major histocompatibility complex ( TCR-MHC) affinities span a wide range in a polyclonal T cell response , yet it is undefined how affinity shapes long-term properties of CD8 T cells during chronic<disease> infection<disease> with persistent antigen. Here , we investigate how the affinity of the TCR-MHC interaction shapes the phenotype of memory CD8 T cells in the chronically
