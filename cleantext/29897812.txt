  Hepatocellular death or ballooning distinguishes the transition of simple steatosis to irreversible nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH). However , the molecular mechanism of hepatocellular apoptosis in NASH is largely unclear , and discovery of endogenous mediators that could prevent or inhibit cell death is thereby critical in intercepting NASH progression. Here , we identified pigment epithelium-derived factor ( PEDF) , a secreted , moonlighting hepatokine as 1 hepatoprotective agent in mice with diet-induced NASH. Hepatic PEDF expression is induced by IL-1β , which is derived from inflammasome activation in liver-resident Kupffer cells , an effect that is negatively regulated by TNF-α and predominantly secreted by monocyte-derived , recruited , hepatic macrophages. Mechanistically , reciprocal and opposing roles for IL-1β and TNF-α in PEDF expression are mediated by differential activation of NF-κB. Although augmented TNF-α production leads to temporal reduction of PEDF expression in NASH , PEDF conversely abrogates TNF-α-mediated hepatocyte death by modulating the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Thus , our study highlights PEDF as a functionally important hepatokine in NASH progression by linking inflammasome activation and hepatocellular death.-Adak , M. , Das , D. , Niyogi , S. , Nagalakshmi , C. , Ray , D. , Chakrabarti , P.
