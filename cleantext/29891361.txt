  Insect cuticle acts as a primary protective barrier against environment stresses that may directly impact the insect body. Here , we report the mechanical defense function of a structural cuticular protein , BmorCPH24 , to environmental stresses using a silkworm Bamboo ( Bo) mutant with this gene mutation. Ultraviolet ( UV) irradiation and topical application of an acetone insecticide were used as environmental stresses to determine the differences in susceptibility between Bo and wild-type larvae. UV irradiation resulted in a sunburn phenotype in the Bo strains earlier than the wild-type indicating the sensitivity of Bo. Higher malondialdehyde ( MDA) content and a lower survival ratio were also observed in the Bo strains. Treatment with deltamethrin revealed that Bo larvae were more sensitive to insecticides than the wild-type. Furthermore , cuticle analysis by microsection revealed thinner cuticle and a significant decrease in the endocuticle layer ( âˆ¼ 64.0 %) in Bo. These results suggest that BmorCPH24 mutation can lead to deficiency in resources required to construct the cuticle in Bo resulting in thin cuticle and reduced resistance to UV and insecticides. These results provide us new insight into the role of structural cuticular proteins in insect cuticle against environment stresses.
