  Background/aim: To investigate the possible differences in endometrial leukocyte subtype distribution between women with unexplained infertility<symptom> and normal fertile women and to determine whether there is a correlation between endometrial leukocyte counts and plasma cytokine levels in unexplained infertility<symptom>. Materials and methods: This case-control study involved 79 infertile and 40 fertile women. Peripheral venous blood samples and endometrial samples were obtained on day 21 of the menstrual cycle. Plasma interleukin-4 ( IL4) , IL6 , IL10 , IL17 , IL35 , interferongamma ( IFN-g) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-a) , transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-b) , and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 ( SOCS3) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Endometrial CD8 , CD56 , and CD163 counts were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: CD8 and CD56 counts were significantly higher , while CD163 count was significantly lower in infertile women than in fertile women. Plasma SOCS3 , IL35 , and IL4 levels of the infertile group were significantly lower than those of the fertile group ( P < 0.01); the remaining cytokine levels were significantly higher in the infertile group than in the fertile group ( P < 0.01). Conclusion: We observed aberrant cytotoxic immune activity in infertile women. The interaction between plasma SOCS3 levels and staining degree of endometrial leukocytes may be either the reason for or result of infertility<symptom> leading to unavailability of the environment for implantation.
