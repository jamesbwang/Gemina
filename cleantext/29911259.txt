  Nowadays , using ionizing radiation ( IR) is necessary for clinical , agricultural , nuclear energy or industrial applications. Accidental exposure to IR after a radiation terror or disaster poses a threat to human. In contrast to the old dogma of radiation toxicity , several experiments during the last two recent decades have revealed that intercellular signaling and communications play a key role in this procedure. Elevated level of cytokines and other intercellular signals increase oxidative damage and inflammatory responses via reduction/oxidation interactions ( redox system). Intercellular signals induce production of free radicals and inflammatory mediators by some intermediate enzymes such as cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) , nitric oxide synthase ( NOS) , NADPH oxidase , and also via triggering mitochondrial ROS. Furthermore , these signals facilitate cell to cell contact and increasing cell toxicity via cohort effect. Nitric oxide is a free radical with ability to act as an intercellular signal that induce DNA damage and changes in some signaling pathways in irradiated as well as non-irradiated adjacent cells. Targeting of these mediators by some anti-inflammatory agents or via antioxidants such as mitochondrial ROS scavengers opens a window to mitigate radiation toxicity after an accidental exposure. Experiments which have been done so far suggests that some cytokines such as IL-1β , TNF-α , TGF-β , IL-4 and IL-13 are some interesting targets that depend on irradiated organs and may help mitigate radiation toxicity. Moreover , animal experiments in recent years indicated that targeting of toll like receptors ( TLRs) may be more useful for radioprotection and mitigation. In this review , we aimed to describe the role of intercellular interactions in oxidative injury , inflammation<symptom> , cell death and killing effects of IR. Moreover , we described evidence on potential mitigation of radiation injury via targeting of these mediators.
