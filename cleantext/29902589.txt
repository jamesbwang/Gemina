  Agenesis and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum ( ACC and HCC) are heterogeneous group with a large variation in published prevalence based on few population based studies. The aim of this work is to describe prevalence , associated factors and other malformations present in cases with either agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum , using a population-based database of all malformations diagnosed in Emilia-Romagna , Italy , ( the Emilia-Romagna Registry on Congenital Malformations , IMER). This registry links and integrates hospital discharge records , birth certificates with cases reported by referral clinicians to identify all structural malformations diagnosed within one year of life regarding live birth , fetal death or termination of pregnancy due to fetal malformations ( TOPFA). During the study period ( 1981-2015) the number of cases with ACC or HCC was 255 , in a reference population of 1,023,784 live births , giving an overall prevalence of 2.49 per 10,000 ( 1.47 per 10,000 only live birth). After 1996 , with the inclusion of TOPFA in IMER registry , the overall prevalence rate increase significantly from 1.42 to 3.03 cases per 10,000 birth ( p-value < 0.001). Prenatal diagnosis was made in 192 cases ( 75.3 %) , at a median gestational age of 20.7 ( IQR: 19.71-22.71). Termination of pregnancy occurred in 105 of the 255 cases ( 41,2 %). Where a prenatal diagnosis was available , 55 % of cases ended in TOPFA ( 105/192) , with higher prevalence of cases associated to central nervous system malformations and multiple birth defects , and median gestational age at diagnosis significantly less than in live birth cases ( 20.3 vs 29 weeks). Agenesis/hypoplasia ratio was 5.7 ( 217/38). The most frequently associated malformations were musculoskeletal. Trisomies were the most frequent chromosomal anomalies , in particularly trisomy18 and 13 ( respectively 9/32 and 4/32 cases). Our study showed an increased risk for male infants ( RR of 1.68 , RR 95 % CI 1.19-2.37). No differences were detected analyzing maternal age and ethnicity , and the increased risk associated to preterm birth disappeared when compared with other malformed infants. This is one of the few population based studies dealing with prevalence of agenesis and hypoplasia of corpus callosum. Prevalence is still debated , but this study adds comprehensive data , in particular inclusion of TOPFA cases. Early prenatal diagnosis , not always possible , could be crucial for decision making regarding continuation of pregnancy.
