  To compare the various Pentacam-measured K-readings with the clinical history method ( CHM) in eyes that have undergone myopic laser in situ keratomileusis ( LASIK). In this prospective study , Pentacam examination was performed in 71 eyes 1 month after myopic LASIK. The true net power ( TNP) 4 mm , total corneal refractive power ( TCRP) 4 mm , equivalent K-reading ( EKR) 4.0 mm , and EKR 4.5 mm obtained from the same scan were compared with the K derived from CHM. The average baseline spherical equivalence was -5.44 ± 2.38 D. After LASIK , the mean KCHM was 37.67 ± 2.13 D , TCRP4mm was 37.14 ± 1.79 D , TNP4mm was 36.88 ± 1.76 D , EKR4 .0 mm was 37.58 ± 1.94 D , and EKR4 .5 mm was 37.51 ± 1.94 D. TCRP4mm , TNP4mm , and EKR4 .5 mm showed a statistically significant deviation from the KCHM , with the mean error being 0.53 D , 0.79 D , and 0.16 D , respectively ( P < 0.05). Only the EKR4 .0 mm showed no statistically significant difference from the KCHM ( mean error 0.09 D , P = 0.23). The EKR4 .0 mm also had the narrowest 95 % limits of agreement ( LoA) ( -1.10 to +1.28 D) , whereas both TCRP4mm and TNP4mm had a wider LoA ( -0.88 to +1.95 D and -0.62 to +2.20 D , respectively). All four Pentacam K-readings had a strong and statistically significant correlation with the KCHM. Using the CHM as reference , the EKR4 .0 mm demonstrated the closest agreement when compared with the EKR4 .5 mm , TNP4mm , and TCRP4mm obtained from the same scan.
