  Considerable evidence has shown that prefrontal neurons expressing D1-type dopamine receptors ( D1DRs) are critical for working memory , flexibility , and timing. This line of work predicts that frontal neurons expressing D1DRs mediate cognitive processing. During timing tasks , one form this cognitive processing might take is time-dependent ramping activity-monotonic changes in firing rate over time. Thus , we hypothesized the prefrontal D1DR + neurons would strongly exhibit time-dependent ramping during interval timing. We tested this idea using an interval-timing task in which we used optogenetics to tag D1DR + neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex ( MFC). While 23 % of MFC D1DR + neurons exhibited ramping , this was significantly less than untagged MFC neurons. By contrast , MFC D1DR + neurons had strong delta-frequency ( 1-4 Hz) coherence with other MFC ramping neurons. This coherence was phase-locked to cue onset and was strongest early in the interval. To test the significance of these interactions , we optogenetically stimulated MFC D1DR + neurons early versus late in the interval. We found that 2-Hz stimulation early in the interval was particularly effective in rescuing timing-related behavioral performance deficits in dopamine-depleted animals. These findings provide insight into MFC networks and have relevance for disorders such as Parkinson 's disease and schizophrenia.
