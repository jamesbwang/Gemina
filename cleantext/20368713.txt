  Papillomavirus<pathogen> capsids are known to have the ability to package DNA plasmids and deliver them both in vitro and in vivo. Of all known papillomavirus<pathogen> types<pathogen> , human papillomaviruses ( HPVs) are by far the most intensely studied. Although HPVs work well as gene transfer vectors , their use is limited as most individuals are exposed to this virus either through a HPV<pathogen> vaccination or natural infection. To circumvent these constraints , we produced pseudovirions ( PsVs) of ten non-human papillomavirus<pathogen> types<pathogen> and tested their transduction efficiencies in vitro. PsVs based on Macaca fascicularis papillomavirus-11 and Puma concolor papillomavirus-1 were further tested in vivo. Intramuscular transduction by PsVs led to months-long expression of a reporter plasmid , indicating that PsVs have potential as gene delivery vectors.
