  It is still unclear how well the established attention deficit-hyperactive disorder ( ADHD)- specific rating scales can differentiate between ADHD symptoms and symptoms of other mental disorders. A total of 274 patients with suspected adult ADHD were extensively examined clinically and guideline-conform in an ADHD outpatient clinic. In 190 patients the diagnosis of ADHD could be made with certainty. The patients were also subsequently assessed according to the DSM IV criteria by self-rating scales on current ( ADHS-SB , ASRS , CAARS) and retrospective ( WURS-K) complaints. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed in order to extract from the questionnaires , which could best distinguish the diagnosis of ADHD from other mental disorders. The results showed that two self-rating scales ( WURS-K and ADHS-SB) were sufficient to correctly diagnose ADHD in 83 % of the patients examined with a sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 56 %. The ADHD-specific self-rating scales are additionally useful for the diagnostic differentiation between ADHD-specific and other psychiatric symptoms in the clinical practice and can improve the safety of the diagnosis.
