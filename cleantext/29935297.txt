  The pharmaceutical industry has entered in a new era , as there is a growing interest in increasing the quality standards of dosage forms , through the implementation of more structured development and manufacturing approaches. For many decades , the manufacturing of drug products was controlled by a regulatory framework to guarantee the quality of the final product through a fixed process and exhaustive testing. Limitations related to the Quality by Test system have been widely acknowledged. The emergence of Quality by Design ( QbD) as a systematic and risk-based approach introduced a new quality concept based on a good understanding of how raw materials and process parameters influence the final quality profile. Although the QbD system has been recognized as a revolutionary approach to product development and manufacturing , its full implementation in the pharmaceutical field is still limited. This is particularly evident in the case of semisolid complex formulation development. The present review aims at establishing a practical QbD framework to describe all stages comprised in the pharmaceutical development of a conventional cream in a comprehensible manner.
