The main outcome was a metabolic risk score ( mean of 5 sex-specific z-scores for waist circumference , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol scaled inversely , and log-transformed triglycerides and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) , for which higher scores indicate greater metabolic risk. Secondary outcomes included score components and dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry fat mass. We measured socioeconomic status , race and/or ethnicity , pubertal status , and obesity-related behaviors ( television-viewing and fast food and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption) using questionnaires. The sample was 51.5 % girls; mean ( SD) age 13.2 ( 0.9) years , median ( interquartile range) sleep duration was 441.1 ( 54.8) minutes per day and sleep efficiency was 84.0 % ( 6.3). Longer sleep duration was associated with lower metabolic risk scores ( -0.11 points; 95 % CI: -0.19 to -0.02 , per interquartile range). Associations with sleep efficiency were similar and persisted after adjustment for BMI Longer sleep duration and higher sleep efficiency were associated with a more favorable cardiometabolic profile in early adolescence , independent of other obesity-related behaviors. These results support the need to assess the role of sleep quantity and quality interventions as strategies for improving cardiovascular risk profiles of adolescents.
