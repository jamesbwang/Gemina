  Fetuin-A and leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 ( LECT-2) are liver-derived proteins. Fetuin-A is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes ( T2D) and obese patients with T2D have higher plasma fetuin-A levels than those without T2D. LECT-2 has positive correlation with the severity of both obesity and insulin resistance. The changes in plasma fetuin-A are not consistent after bariatric surgery and no studies have investigated the changes in LECT-2 on the obese patients with T2D after bariatric surgery. Overall , 18 patients undergoing gastric bypass ( GB) and 16 patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy ( SG) were enrolled. The fasting plasma fetuin-A and LECT-2 levels were measured at baseline , one week , three months , and one year after surgery. Both the GB and SG groups significantly decreased the body mass index ( BMI) , waist-to-hip ratio , a body shape index; the triglyceride , fasting blood sugar ( FBS) , hemoglobin A1c , C-peptide levels; and homeostatic model assessment ( HOMA-IR) one year after surgery. The SG group showed a decreasing trend in plasma fetuin-A levels one year after SG surgery. There are no significant changes in LECT-2 one year after either GB or SG. Fetuin-A had a near significant negative relationship with insulin ( Neither GB nor SG modifies plasma levels of plasma fetuin-A or LECT-2 in T2D patients after surgery. The changes in plasma fetuin-A have a positive correlation with those of the BMI and waist-to-hip ratio 12 months after GB.
