  To investigate if blood biomarkers could indicate early signs of lung damage or cardiovascular risk due to exposure to grain dust. Pneumoproteins and markers of inflammation<symptom> and platelet activation were analysed in blood samples of 102 grain elevator and compound feed mill workers. Differences between exposed ( n = 67) and controls ( n = 35) , and associations with exposure measurements and respiratory health were investigated by multiple linear regression analyses. Concentrations of CC-16 and IL-6 were higher in exposed workers compared with controls ( p < 0.001 for both) , whereas fibrinogen was lower ( p = 0.005). Concentrations of CRP , TNF-Î± , sCD40L and sP-selectin were similar in both groups. Serum CC-16 was significantly higher in workers with farm childhood , regardless of exposure. The impact of farm childhood on CC-16 interacted with smoking. None of the biomarkers were associated with exposure measurements or any of the tested respiratory health parameters. Dust exposure induced inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions , but did not induce systemic inflammation<symptom> and had no effect on platelet activation. No cause-effect relationship could be established in spite of relatively high exposure levels , particularly to endotoxin. Whether increased serum CC-16 is an early sign of lung damage or a reversible defense reaction remains unclear.
