  A comprehensive study on the preparation , hydrolytic stability , and the structural and spectrophotometric properties of 1,2,4,5-oxadiazaboroles is presented by way of a comparison between the NSAID drug valdecoxib ( 1) and its unprecedented B-N isostere , borazavaldecoxib ( 2). Knowledge gained from this study was employed in the design of oxadiazaborate salts , a novel class of tetrahedral boron heterocycles displaying good stability in aqueous conditions with promising antifungal and antibacterial properties.
