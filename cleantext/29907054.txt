  Predicting vapor liquid equilibria ( VLE) of molecules governed by weak van der Waals ( vdW) interactions using the first principles approach is a significant challenge. Due to the poor scaling of the post Hartree-Fock wave function theory with system size/basis functions , the Kohn-Sham density functional theory ( DFT) is preferred for systems with a large number of molecules. However , traditional DFT can not adequately account for medium to long range correlations which are necessary for modeling vdW interactions. Recent developments in DFT such as dispersion corrected models and nonlocal van der Waals functionals have attempted to address this weakness<symptom> with a varying degree of success. In this work , we predict the VLE of argon and assess the performance of several density functionals and the second order MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation theory ( MP2) by determining critical and structural properties via first principles Monte Carlo simulations. PBE-D3 , BLYP-D3 , and rVV10 functionals were used to compute vapor liquid coexistence curves , while PBE0-D3 , M06-2X-D3 , and MP2 were used for computing liquid density at a single state point. The performance of the PBE-D3 functional for VLE is superior to other functionals ( BLYP-D3 and rVV10). At T = 85 K and P = 1 bar , MP2 performs well for the density and structural features of the first solvation shell in the liquid phase.
