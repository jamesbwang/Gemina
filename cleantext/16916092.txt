  We assessed the impact of a common sleep disturbance , the social jetlag , on postural control during a period involving workdays and free days. The sleep habits of 30 healthy subjects were registered with a wrist actimeter for nine days ( starting on Friday) and they participated in a set of four postural control tests carried out on Friday and on Monday. In addition , the subjects filled questionnaires about their sleep conditions and preferences. Actimetry measurements were used to calculate the Mid Sleep Phase ( MSP). The difference between the MSP values on the workdays and free days measures the social jetlag. There were significant differences in sleep variables between workdays and free days. Postural control performance improved on Monday , after free sleep over the weekend , when compared with the tests performed on Friday. It seems that social jetlag affects brain areas involved in the control of posture<symptom> , such as thalamus and the prefrontal cortex as well as the cerebellum , resulting in a worse performance in postural control. The performance improvement in the posture<symptom> tests after the free days could be attributed to a lower sleep debt.
