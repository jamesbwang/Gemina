  To evaluate the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR) on exercise performance and quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) with different degrees of static lung hyperinflation ( LH). Retrospective cohort study. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Network. A cohort of 1981 patients with COPD ( 55 % males; age: 66.8 ± 9.3 y; FEV1 %: 50.7 ± 19.5; RV %: 163.0 ± 49.7). An interdisciplinary PR program for patients with COPD consisting of 40 sessions. Participants were stratified into five quintiles according to baseline RV and were evaluated on the basis of pre and post PR 6 minute walk distance ( 6MWD) , constant work rate test ( CWRT) and Saint George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ) , among other clinical parameters. With increasing RV quintile , patients were younger , more frequently female , had lower FEV1 % , lower body mass index and fat-free mass index , shorter 6MWD , shorter CWRT and worse SGRQ scores ( p < 0.01). All RV strata improved following PR in all three outcomes ( p < 0.001). Nevertheless , higher , compared to lower RV categories , had lower ΔCWRT ( p < 0.01) but similar Δ6MWD ( p = 0.948) and ΔSGRQ ( p = 0.086) after PR. LH in COPD is related to younger age , female gender , lower body<symptom> weight , worse exercise capacity and health status , but did not prevent patients from benefitting from PR. LH however influences walking and cycling response following PR differently.
