  To evaluate the impact of cancer upon a patient 's depletion of net worth and incursion of debt in the U.S.. This longitudinal study used the Health and Retirement Study ( HRS) from 1998-2014. Persons ≥ 50 years with newly-diagnosed malignancies were included , excluding minor skin cancers. Multivariable generalized linear models were employed to assess changes in net worth and debt ( consumer , mortgage , home equity) at two-and four-years following diagnosis ( Year Across 9.5 million total estimated new diagnoses of cancer from 2000-2012 , individuals averaged 68.6 ± 9.4 years with slight majorities being married ( 54.7 %) , not retired ( 51.1 %) , and Medicare beneficiaries ( 56.6 %). At Year Using nationally-representative data , this investigation of an estimated 9.5 million newly-diagnosed persons with cancer ≥ 50 years of age found a substantial proportion incurring financial toxicity. As large financial burdens have been found to adversely affect access to care and outcomes among cancer patients , the active development of approaches to mitigate these effects among already vulnerable groups remain of key importance.
