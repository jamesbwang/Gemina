  RNA interference ( RNAi) is currently the only method available in planaria for assessing the function of particular genes. We describe here a method for performing body-wide gene knockdown , relying on dsRNA production in bacteria and subsequent delivery to planaria by feeding a liver-bacteria mixture. This method is ideal for screening many genes in parallel , in a cost-effective and reliable manner. We also describe a ligation-independent cloning strategy , which is used to rapidly transfer single genes into an RNAi vector that is also appropriate for downstream applications such as in situ hybridizations. Together , these protocols represent useful components of the current planarian molecular tool kit.
