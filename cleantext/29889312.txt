  Hazardous chemicals in the environment and diet or their electrophilic metabolites can form adducts with genomic DNA , which can lead to mutations and the initiation of cancer. In addition , reactive intermediates can be generated in the body through oxidative stress and damage the genome. The identification and measurement of DNA adducts are required for understanding exposure and the causal role of a genotoxic chemical in cancer risk. Over the past three decades ,
