  In urban drainage systems , a sudden increase in the flow rate can cause the transition of the flow from open channel to pipe flow , and the entrapment of large air pockets in sewers , which might result in serious geysers and water-hammer like pressure events. This paper presents a numerical analysis of flow processes associated with the pressurization and release of an air pocket in order to study its influence on transient pressure in a horizontal pipe with an end orifice. The influence of the air pocket inside the pipe on the peak pressure can be described in two distinct regimes. In regime I for the pipe with a small orifice , the peak pressure is modulated by the pressurization and expansion of the air pocket and its subsequent damping. In regime II for the pipe with a large orifice , air can be quickly expelled , and the water column directly impinges on the pipe end wall and causes water-hammer like pressure. With the increase of the orifice size , the peak pressure decreases due to the change in the water velocity. In the study cases , the peak pressure in regime I is about two times the inlet pressure , while it can be more than forty times in regime II.
