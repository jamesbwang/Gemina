  An adult , wild-caught , female Florida scrub<disease> jay ( Aphelocoma coerulescens) was evaluated because of an observable mass on the ventral neck. Initial physical examination and diagnostic tests were performed , which revealed a subcutaneous mass. Surgical removal of the mass was attempted , but the bird died during surgery. Results of necropsy<disease> and histopathologic evaluation identified the mass as thymic lymphoma with proventricular metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for CD3 in the thymic mass and within the predominant lymphoid population in the serosal proventricular masses , which confirmed metastasis of T-cell lymphoma. To our knowledge , this is the first report of T-cell thymic lymphoma in a wild Florida scrub<disease> jay.
