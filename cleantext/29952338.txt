  Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency requires evaluation by dynamic stimulation tests. The insulin tolerance test ( ITT) is accepted as the gold-standard test for the evaluation of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis but the test is unpleasant and dangerous. Although it takes more time , glucagon stimulation test ( GST) is a good alternative to ITT. The primary aim of this study was to compare the ITT and GSTs in the evaluation of HPA axe in patients with pituitary disorders. We conducted a prospective study in which ITT and GST were performed within 7 days in 81 patients. Serum cortisol was measured. We divided our population in Group 1 ( G1): Adrenal Insufficiency ( Peak cortisol under ITT < 200 ng/mL) and Group 2 ( G2): normal response ( Peak cortisol under ITT > 200 ng/mL). Receiver-operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis was performed to identify the thresholds for GST. The mean peak of cortisol under GST was not significantly different from that obtained after ITT in the whole cohort ( 182.67 ± 89.07 ng/mL vs. 179.75 ± 79.01 ng/mL) , and it was significantly reduced in patients of G1 ( p < 10
