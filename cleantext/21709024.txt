  Retrospective case-control study of authors experience in the modified Bristow-Latarjet procedure for treatment of recurrent traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation with glenoid bone injury. Sample with 102 recurrent glenohumeral dislocation cases submitted to modified Bristow-Latarjet procedure. Indications included situations of recurrent traumatic anterior glenohumeral instability with more than two dislocation episodes and with glenoid bone attritional or fragmentary injuries , without possibility of reconstruction. Mean follow-up time was 5.33 ± 2.74 years ( minimum 1; range 1-13). The mean Walch-Duplay Score at the last evaluation was 91.23 ± 11.46 ( range 15-100). The functional score of patients with glenoid bone loss greater than 20 % did not show a significant difference in comparison with patients with glenoid bone loss lower than 20 % ( 90 The modified Bristow-Latarjet procedure is a very effective procedure with few complications in the medium-term , showing very satisfactory functional outcomes in the treatment of recurrent traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation associated with glenoid bone injury.
