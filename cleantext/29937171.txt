  Intravenous iron therapy has been shown to be advantageous in treating anaemia and reducing the need for blood transfusions. Iron treatment , however , may also be hazardous by supporting cancer growth. Present clinical study explores , for the first time , the effect of preoperative intravenous iron therapy on tumour prognosis in anaemic colorectal cancer patients. A retrospective cohort study was performed on consecutive patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer between 2010 and 2016 in a single teaching hospital. The primary outcomes were 5-year overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS). Survival estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and patients were matched based on propensity score. 320 ( 41.0 %) of all eligible patients were anaemic , of whom 102 patients received preoperative intravenous iron treatment ( 31.9 %). After propensity score matching 83 patients were included in both intravenous and non-intravenous iron group. The estimated 1- , 3- , and 5-year OS ( 91.6 % , 73.1 % , 64.3 % , respectively) and DFS ( 94.5 % , 86.7 % , 83.4 % , respectively) in the intravenous iron group were comparable with the non-intravenous iron group ( p = 0.456 and p = 0.240 , respectively). In comparing patients with an event ( death or recurrence) and no event in the intravenous iron group , a distinct trend was found for decreased transferrin in the event group ( median 2.53 g/L vs 2.83 g/L , p = 0.052). The present study illustrates that a dose of 1000-2000 mg preoperative intravenous iron therapy does not have a profound effect on long-term overall and disease-free survival in anaemic colorectal cancer patients. Future randomised trials with sufficient power are required to draw definite conclusions on the safety of intravenous iron therapy.
