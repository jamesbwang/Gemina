  The alteration of glucose metabolism is one of the first biochemical characteristics associated with cancer cells since most of these cells increase glucose consumption and glycolytic rates even in the presence of oxygen , which has been called & ldquo; aerobic glycolysis & rdquo; or the Warburg effect. Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) is associated with approximately 5 % of all human cancers worldwide , principally to cervical cancer. E6 and E7 are the main viral oncoproteins which are required to preserve the malignant phenotype. These viral proteins regulate the cell cycle through their interaction with tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRB , respectively. Together with the viral proteins E5 and E2 , E6 and E7 can favor the Warburg effect and contribute to radio- and chemoresistance through the increase in the activity of glycolytic enzymes , as well as the inhibition of the Krebs cycle and the respiratory chain. These processes lead to a fast production of ATP obtained by Warburg , which could help satisfy the high energy demands of cancer cells during proliferation. In this way HPV<pathogen> proteins could promote cancer hallmarks. However , it is also possible that during an early HPV<pathogen> infection , the Warburg effect could help in the achievement of an efficient viral replication.
