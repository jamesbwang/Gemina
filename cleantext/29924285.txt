 . To determine the connection between polymorphism IL-1B C ( +3953/ 4) T and chronic periodontitis<disease> in adults.. Case and control study. Individuals between 18 and 64 years of age were included; they were recruited through healthcare campaigns carried out in 2012 in different areas of the city of Lima with similar socio-economic characteristics. Dentists specialized in periodontics performed the diagnosis of the periodontal state of participants; genotyping was made through the PCR-RFLP technique. The data were analyzed by logistic regression.. The factors associated with chronic periodontitis<disease> were: age over 46 years ( OR: 7.50 , CI 95 %: 1.85-6.37) , higher education level achieved ( OR: 0.43 , CI 95 %: 0.27-0.98) , the presence of allele 2 in the polymorphism of IL-1B. The positive genotype ( 2-2) was associated with the presence of chronic periodontitis<disease> ( OR: 2.06 , CI 95 %: 1.01-4.21).. The presence of allele 2 in the polymorphism of IL-1B and the positive genotype ( 2-2) confers greater risk for the development of chronic periodontitis<disease> in the population of Peruvian adults under study.
