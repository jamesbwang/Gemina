  For sustainable crop cultivation in the face of global warming , it is important to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying plant adaptation to a warming climate and apply this information to breeding. Thermomorphogenesis and ambient temperature signaling pathways have been well studied in model plants , but little information is available for vegetable crops. Here , we investigated genes responsive to warming conditions from two
