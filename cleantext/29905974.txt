  Functionalized indoles are recurrent motifs in bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals. While transition metal-catalyzed carbene transfer has provided an attractive route to afford C3-functionalized indoles , these protocols are viable only in the presence of N-protected indoles , owing to competition from the more facile N-H insertion reaction. Herein , a biocatalytic strategy for enabling the direct C-H functionalization of unprotected indoles is reported. Engineered variants of myoglobin provide efficient biocatalysts for this reaction , which has no precedents in the biological world , enabling the transformation of a broad range of indoles in the presence of ethyl Î±-diazoacetate to give the corresponding C3-functionalized derivatives in high conversion yields and excellent chemoselectivity. This strategy could be exploited to develop a concise chemoenzymatic route to afford the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin.
