  PD0013 was a 6-month noninterventional study in clinical practice comparing effectiveness/tolerability of rotigotine + levodopa in younger ( < 70 years) vs. older ( ≥ 70 years) Parkinson 's disease ( PD) patients. Patients previously received levodopa for ≥ 6 months as monotherapy/in combination with another dopamine-agonist ( DA). Primary variable: Unified PD Rating Scale ( UPDRS) Part-II change from baseline to end-of-observation-period ( EOP). 91 younger/99 older patients started rotigotine; 68 younger/62 older patients completed the study. Most switched from levodopa + another DA. Addition of rotigotine as first DA was more common in older patients ( 20.2 % vs. 15.4 %). Mean ± SD rotigotine-exposure: 6.1 ± 3.4 mg/24h younger vs. 4.9 ± 2.4 mg/24h older. Eleven patients changed levodopa dose. At EOP , improvement in mean UPDRS-II was greater in younger patients ( p = 0.0289). UPDRS-II responder-rate ( ≥ 20 % decrease in UPDRS-II score) was higher in younger patients ( 42.3 % vs. 25.9 %). Improvement across age groups was similar on PD Sleep Scale-2 and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale. Adverse drug reactions ( ADRs) , and discontinuations because of ADRs , were more common among older patients. There were no new safety signals. Despite low rotigotine doses , when added to levodopa/switched from levodopa + another DA , rotigotine led to greater improvement in UPDRS-II in younger patients ( < 70 years). Individual patient data revealed clinically meaningful improvements in UPDRS-II in both groups.
