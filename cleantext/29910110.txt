  DNA replication introduces a dosage imbalance between early and late replicating genes. In budding yeast , buffering gene expression against this imbalance depends on marking replicated DNA by H3K56 acetylation ( H3K56ac). Whether additional processes are required for suppressing transcription from H3K56ac-labeled DNA remains unknown. Here , using a database-guided candidate screen , we find that COMPASS , the H3K4 methyltransferase , and its upstream effector , PAF1C , act downstream of H3K56ac to buffer expression. Replicated genes show reduced abundance of the transcription activating mark H3K4me3 and accumulate the transcription inhibitory mark H3K4me2 near transcription start sites. Notably , in hydroxyurea-exposed cells , the S phase checkpoint stabilizes H3K56ac and becomes essential for buffering. We suggest that H3K56ac suppresses transcription of replicated genes by interfering with post-replication recovery of epigenetic marks and assign a new function for the S phase checkpoint in stabilizing this mechanism during persistent dosage imbalance.
