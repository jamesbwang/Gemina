  Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is one of the fundamental pathological causes of brain disease such as vascular dementia. Exploration of effective treatments for this is of great interest. Histidine has been reported to be effective in anti-apoptosis , antioxidant , and against excitotoxicity. In the present study , we aim to investigate whether histidine could have a therapeutic effect on the impairments induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion model was established through bilateral common carotid arteries stenosis ( BCAS) operation in Tie2-GFP mice. Radial arm maze and Morris water maze revealed that histidine showed potential improvement of the tendency of cognitive impairments induced by hypoperfusion. The possible mechanisms were further investigated. After administration of histidine in hypoperfusion mice , immunofluorescent BrdU staining revealed more new-born nerve cells.
