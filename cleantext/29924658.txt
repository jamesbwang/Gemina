  I analyze the alternative tactics and logics of Las Fuertes , a feminist organization that has taken an `` alegal '' approach to realizing the human right to abortion<disease> in the conservative Mexican state of Guanajuato. Since a series of United Nations agreements throughout the 1990s enshrined reproductive rights as universal human rights , Mexican feminists have adopted the human rights platform as a lobbying tool to pressure the government to reform restrictive abortion<disease> laws. This strategy bore fruit in Mexico City , with passage of the historic 2007 abortion<disease> legalization. Las Fuertes has leveraged the human rights strategy differently- to justify the direct provision of local abortion<disease> accompaniment in a context of near-total abortion<disease> criminalization. By directly seizing abortion<disease> rights , rather than seeking to implement them through legalistic channels , Las Fuertes has effectively challenged Mexican reproductive governance in an adversarial political environment.
