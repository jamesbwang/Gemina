  Children adeptly use environmental boundaries to navigate. But how do they represent surfaces as boundaries , and how does this change over development? To investigate the effects of boundaries as visual and physical barriers , we tested spatial reorientation in 160 children ( 2-7 year-olds) in a transparent rectangular arena ( Condition 1). In contrast with their consistent success using opaque surfaces ( Condition 2) , children only succeeded at using transparent surfaces at 5-7 years of age. These results suggest a critical role of visually opaque surfaces in early spatial coding and a developmental change around the age of five in representing locations with respect to transparent surfaces. In application , these findings may inform our usage of windows and glass surfaces in designing and building environments occupied by young children.
