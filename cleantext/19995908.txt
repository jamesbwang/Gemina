  Mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC) are components of connective tissues and , in vitro , cell entities characterized by cell adhesion and immunophenotyping , although specific markers for their identification are lacking. Currently , MSC derived from either human bone<disease> marrow ( BM-MSC) or adipose tissue ( Ad-MSC) are considered the main sources of MSC for cell therapy. Eph receptors and their ligands , Ephrins , are molecules involved in cell adhesion and migration in several tissues and organs. In the current study , we analyze the pattern of Eph/Ephrin expression in MSC and evaluate the effects of blockade and stimulation of these receptor/ligand pairs on their biology. Eph/Ephrin expression was analyzed in both BM-MSC and Ad-MSC by qRT-PCR. Then , we supplied BM-MSC cultures with either blocking or activating compounds to evaluate their effects on MSC proliferation , survival , and cell cycle by FACS. Changes in cytoskeleton and integrin α5β1 expression were studied in stimulated BM-MSC by immunofluorescence microscopy and FACS , respectively. Higher numbers of Eph/Ephrin transcripts occurred in BM-MSC than in Ad-MSC. In addition , the blocking of Eph/Ephrin signaling correlated with decreased numbers of BM-MSC due to increased proportions of apoptotic cells in the cultures but without variations in the cycling cells. Unexpectedly , activation of Eph/Ephrin signaling by clustered Eph/Ephrin fusion proteins also resulted in increased proportions of apoptotic MSC. In this case , MSC underwent important morphological changes , associated with altered cytoskeleton and integrin α5β1 expression , which did not occur under the blocking conditions. Taken together , these results suggest that Eph/Ephrin activation affects cell survival through alterations in cell attachment to culture plates , affecting the biology of BM-MSC.
