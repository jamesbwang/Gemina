  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) play key roles in human cancers. Here , FEZF1-AS1 , a highly overexpressed lncRNA in colorectal cancer ( CRC) , was identified by lncRNA microarrays. We aimed to explore the roles and possible molecular mechanisms of FEZF1-AS1 in CRC. LncRNA expression in CRC tissues was measured by lncRNA microarray and qRT-PCR. The functional roles of FEZF1-AS1 in CRC were demonstrated by a series of We identified a series of differentially expressed lncRNAs in CRC using lncRNA microarrays , and revealed that FEZF1-AS1 is one of the most overexpressed. Further validation in two expanded CRC cohorts confirmed the upregulation of FEZF1-AS1 in CRC , and revealed that increased FEZF1-AS1 expression is associated with poor survival. Functional assays revealed that FEZF1-AS1 promotes CRC cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically , FEZF1-AS1 could bind and increase the stability of the pyruvate kinase 2 ( PKM2) protein , resulting in increased cytoplasmic and nuclear PKM2 levels. Increased cytoplasmic PKM2 promoted pyruvate kinase activity and lactate production ( aerobic glycolysis) , whereas FEZF1-AS1-induced nuclear PKM2 upregulation further activated STAT3 signaling. In addition , PKM2 was upregulated in CRC tissues and correlated with FEZF1-AS1 expression and patient survival. Together , these data provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of FEZF1-AS1 on both STAT3 signaling and glycolysis by binding PKM2 and increasing its stability.
