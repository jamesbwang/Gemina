  A substantial portion of We performed a retrospective review of all inpatients with CDI , in a 1300-bed tertiary-care hospital in Korea , from 2008 through 2015. CO-CDI was defined as CDI occurring within 48 h of admission. Poor<symptom> outcome was defined as follows: 1) all-cause 30-day mortality , 2) in-hospital mortality , or 3) surgery due to CDI. Of a total 1256 CDIs occurring over 8 years , 152 ( 12.1 %) cases were classified as CO-CDI and 23 ( 15.1 %) had a poor outcome , including 22 ( 14.5 %) cases of mortality and 2 ( 1.3 %) cases of surgery. Patients with a poor outcome had a higher mean age than those without a poor outcome ( 75.8 vs. 69.6 years , Clinicians should not only be aware of the possibility of CDI in the community setting but also pay more attention to PPI-using elderly patients with anemia<symptom> in consideration of a poor outcome.
