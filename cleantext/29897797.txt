  Nitrogen ( N) and phosphorus ( P) limit primary production in many aquatic ecosystems , with major implications for ecological interactions in plankton communities. Yet it remains unclear how evolution may affect the N ∶ P stoichiometry of phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions. Here , we address this issue by analyzing an eco-evolutionary model of phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions with explicit nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics. In our model , investment of phytoplankton in nitrogen versus phosphorus uptake is an evolving trait , and zooplankton display selectivity for phytoplankton with N ∶ P ratios matching their nutritional requirements. We use this model to explore implications of the contrasting N ∶ P requirements of copepods versus cladocerans. The model predicts that selective zooplankton strongly affect the N ∶ P ratio of phytoplankton , resulting in deviations from their optimum N ∶ P ratio. Specifically , selective grazing by nitrogen-demanding copepods favors dominance of phytoplankton with low N ∶ P ratios , whereas phosphorus-demanding cladocerans favor dominance of phytoplankton with high N ∶ P ratios. Interestingly , selective grazing by nutritionally balanced zooplankton leads to the occurrence of alternative stable states , where phytoplankton may evolve either low , optimum , or high N ∶ P ratios , depending on the initial conditions. These results offer a new perspective on commonly observed differences in N ∶ P stoichiometry between plankton of freshwater and those of marine ecosystems and indicate that selective grazing by zooplankton can have a major impact on the stoichiometric composition of phytoplankton.
