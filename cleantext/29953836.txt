  Poverty is a complex problem in the United States with far-reaching consequences , often leading to a lack of food or lack of access to food. Proper nutrition and food intake are foundational to health and well-being. This participatory action research ( PAR) project explored the challenges associated with living in poverty and managing food resources. Stakeholders engaged in a multiphase PAR process , which resulted in the development and implementation of a 7-wk occupation-based program. The program promotes graded learning of specific skills for managing food resources and emphasizes empowering each participant. Preliminary results indicate statistically significant improvements in participants ' ability to make meals with certain food items and in perceived satisfaction and performance in self-identified activities related to food resource management. These findings support the feasibility of the program and the need for participant-driven , occupation-based approaches to improving food security.
