  In recent times , daily , ordinary medical practices have incontrovertibly been developing under the condition of complexity. Complexity jeopardizes the moral core of practicing medicine: helping people , with their illnesses and suffering , in a medically competent way. Practical wisdom ( a modification of the Aristotelian phronèsis) has been proposed as part of the solution to navigate complexity , aiming at the provision of morally good care. Practical wisdom should help practitioners to maneuver in complexity , where the presupposed linear ways of operating prove to be insufficient. However , this solution is unsatisfactory , because the proposed versions of practical wisdom are too individualistic of nature , while physicians are continuously operating in varying teams , and dealing with complicated technologies and pressing structures. A second point of critique is , that these versions are theory based , and thus insufficiently attuned to the actual context of everyday medical practices. Now , our proposal is to use an approach of practical wisdom that enables medical practices to counter the complexity issue and to re-invent the moral core of medical practicing as well. This implies a practice oriented approach , as thematized by practice theory , qualitative empirical research from the inside , and abduction from actual performed practical wisdom towards an apt understanding of phronèsis.
