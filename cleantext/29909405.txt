  There is a compelling need for quality tools that enable effective control of the extra-analytical phase. In this regard , Six Sigma seems to offer a valid methodological and conceptual opportunity , and in recent times , the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine has adopted it for indicating the performance requirements for non-analytical laboratory processes. However , the Six Sigma implies a distinction between short-term and long-term quality that is based on the dynamics of the processes. These concepts are still not widespread and applied in the field of laboratory medicine although they are of fundamental importance to exploit the full potential of this methodology. This paper reviews the Six Sigma quality concepts and shows how they originated from Shewhart 's control charts , in respect of which they are not an alternative but a completion. It also discusses the dynamic nature of process and how it arises , concerning particularly the long-term dynamic mean variation , and explains why this leads to the fundamental distinction of quality we previously mentioned.
