  Management of combined endodontic-periodontal lesions<symptom> needs more clinical investigations. The aim of this prospective randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effect oftime interval between the non-surgical endodontic treatment ( ET) and open flap debridement ( OFD) on periodontal healing in combined endodontic periodontal lesions<symptom> with apical communication. Forty patients were randomly allocated to two treatment protocols. Group 1 ( immediate periodontal surgery): OFD was performed at 21 days of initiation of ET and SRP , and Group 2 ( delayed periodontal surgery): OFD was performed after 3 months of initiation of ET and SRP. The primary parameters included probing pocket depth ( PPD) , relative attachment level ( RAL) and bleeding on probing ( BOP) and tooth mobility ( TM). Significantly more reduction in PPD , TM and gain in RAL was observed in Group 1 at 3 months of OFD. ( P < 0.05) Whereas at 6 months follow up of OFD ( 6 and 9 months of ET in Group1 and Group 2 , respectively) , intergroup analysis showed statistically comparable reduction in BOP ( %) , PPD , TM and gain in RAL ( P > 0.05) in both the groups. Immediate periodontal surgery may not affect the outcome of the treatment of combined endo-perio lesions<symptom> with apical communication.
