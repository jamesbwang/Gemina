However , there are still no reports of a protocol for bichectomy surgeries ' postoperative period. This article presents six reports of clinical cases in which bichectomy surgery was performed. In the postoperative period , three patients were submitted to PBM with low-power lasers , while three patients did not receive it. Facial<symptom> edema<symptom> was evaluated using a millimeter tape. Pain was determined using the visual analog scale. Data of each clinical case were evaluated in a descriptive way and compared.
