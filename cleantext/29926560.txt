  To cope with overcrowding , a consequence of their constant growth , emergency departments have implemented operational strategies based on triage systems. Despite its interest , nurse triage has been limited by several hindrances , and new strategies are emerging. Among those , advanced nurse triage , allowing a nurse to initiate the diagnostic process just after categorization of the patient , seems to be promising. A study on advanced nurse triage for patients presenting with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> has been conducted in the emergency department of the CHU of Li√®ge. The encouraging results obtained following this new system demonstrate a reduction of the delay to management of patients , and a reduction of the total length of stay in the emergency unit mainly during overcrowding periods. Advanced nurse triage , in addition to a conventional triage during overcrowding periods , improves management of patients in terms of time and reduces the total time spent in the emergency department.
