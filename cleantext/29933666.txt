  The study is aimed to fully analyze antioxidant activty and stability of color-related components from Dendrobium officinale flower. The contents of anthocyanins , carotenoids and flavonoids of 10 varieties including whole flower and labellum of D.officinale flower were detected using UV visible spectroscopy technique and evaluated for their 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical ( DPPH ·) , superoxide anion radical ( · O ⁻₂) and hydroxy radical ( · OH) scavenging activty. And the effects of 4 kinds of metal ions ( Cu ² ⁺ , Mg ² ⁺ , Al ³ ⁺ , K ⁺) and 2 kinds of food additives were investigated on the stability of anthocyanins pigment from D.officinale flower. The results indicated that the flower of D.officinale contained anthocyanins , carotenoids and flavonoids , and their contents in different parts of different families varied. The content of anthocyanins ( 1 330.9 μg · g ⁻¹) in labellum was significantly higher than that in the whole flower ( 696.3 μg · g ⁻¹). The content of carotenoids was positively correlated with the content of anthocyanins , and there was significant positive correlation between the scavenging capacities of the three free radicals and the contents of anthocyanin , respectively ( 0.415,0.384,0.455). The Cu ² ⁺ , Mg ² ⁺ , Al ³ ⁺ , K ⁺ and glucose showed significant color-enhancing effect and could increase the stability of anthocyanin in D.officinale flower , while ascorbic acids showed remarkably degradation effect of anthocyanin in D.officinale flower.
