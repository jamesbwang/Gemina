  Magnetic resonance electrical property tomography ( MR-EPT) reconstructs electrical properties ( EPs) from measured magnetic fields in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) systems. In this study , an MR-EPT method was proposed that utilized a new finite difference approximation of the involved differential wave equation. Compared with existing MR-EPT approaches , the construction of the system matrix involves applying the first derivative twice based on a larger number of neighbouring finite-difference grids , which is different from a standard Laplacian operator on a regular grid structure , leading to a better conditioned linear inverse problem. With improved noise robustness , more faithful EPs can be obtained by the proposed method , particularly at tissue boundaries and regions with a poorly measured magnetic field ( low signal-to-noise ratio). Numerical simulations with a specially designed multi-slice phantom and an anatomically accurate head model ( Duke) have demonstrated that the proposed method can provide a more faithful reconstruction of EPs compared to existing methods , which usually offer unreliable solutions associated with traditional finite difference approximation of the central wave equation and unrealistic assumptions. Experiments on a 9.4 T MRI system have been conducted to validate the simulations.
