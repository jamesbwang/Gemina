  Phytochemical investigation of the lipophilic extract of the roots of Salvia leriifolia resulted in the isolation of the new rearranged abietane diterpenoids leriifoliol ( 1) and leriifolione ( 2) , together with 10 known diterpenoids. Structure elucidations were performed via extensive NMR and HRESIMS data , and the absolute configurations of compounds 1 and 3-5 were established by evaluation of experimental and calculated ECD spectra. The antiplasmodial activity of the new isolates was assayed against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense , T. cruzi , Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> , and Leishmania donovani and also toxicity against rat myoblast ( L6) cells. Compound 1 displayed antimalarial and low cytotoxic activity with IC
