  The clinical outcomes of post-mastectomy radiation therapy ( PMRT) without bolus remain to be fully examined , so that we evaluated clinical outcomes of PMRT without bolus and to measure the chest-wall dose surface histogram ( DSH) parameters. Fifty-two patients with breast cancer who received PMRT without bolus were retrospectively analyzed. DSH values of the percentage of maximum dose ( D All patients completed the treatment; the median follow-up period was 22.1 months. The 2-year overall survival and local control rates were 85 % and 95 %. Five patients developed grade 2 acute radiation dermatitis<disease> , and none developed grade 2 or higher late radiation dermatitis<disease>. The median D PMRT without bolus resulted in a low frequency of grade 2 or higher radiation dermatitis<disease> without increasing locoregional recurrences , and the D
