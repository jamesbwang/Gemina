  Hidradenitis Suppurativa ( HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by inflamed nodules<pathogen> , abscesses<pathogen> , sinus tracts<pathogen> , and scarring , which can occur in any skin containing folliculopilosebaceous units. We aim to identify the demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment modalities in patients with HS. A retrospective analysis involving records of patients diagnosed with HS in Hospital Kuala Lumpur from July 2009 to June 2016. Sixty-two patients were identified , with equal cases involving males and females. Majority of patients were Malays ( 41.9 %) , followed by Indians ( 35.5 %) , Chinese ( 17.7 %) , and other ethnicities ( 4.8 %). Median age at diagnosis was 25 ( IQR: 14) years. There is a delay in diagnosis with a median of 24 ( IQR: 52) months. Most of the patients had lesions<pathogen> on the axilla ( 85.5 %) , followed by groin ( 33.9 %) and gluteal region ( 29 %). Gluteal lesions<pathogen> were more common in males. Nodules<pathogen> ( 67.7 %) , sinuses ( 56.5 %) , and abscesses<pathogen> ( 33.9 %) were the main clinical features , with 43.5 % classified under Hurley stage 2. There was no difference in terms of symptoms and types of lesions<pathogen> among different ethnicities and genders. Majority received systemic antibiotics , more than half had retinoid , and third of the patients had surgical intervention. A prompt recognition of HS is imperative , to screen for comorbidities and to initiate early treatment to reduce physical and psychological complications.
