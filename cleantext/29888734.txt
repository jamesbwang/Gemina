  Atopic transverse myelitis is a rare disorder that is defined as a localized myelitis of an unknown cause in patients with either high immunoglobulin E ( IgE) level or mite-specific IgE or coexistent atopic disease. It is a cause of intramedullary cord lesions<symptom> , but its diagnosis does not need tissue confirmation. We report a case of a patient who presented with bladder and anal incontinence , paresthesia , and lower limb<symptom> weakness<symptom> Neither IgE level nor mite-specific IgE level could be determined due to lack of fund; however , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) of the thoracolumbar region showed hypotense-isotense lesion<symptom> within the spinal cord at T4 vertebral level , suggestive of transverse myelitis. Blood cell count showed hypereosinophilia. Therefore , a diagnosis of atopic transverse myelitis based on high eosinophil count and MRI was made. Patient was commenced on prednisolone and had good response to treatment. Complete blood count is a cheap simple diagnostic tool in resource-poor country to distinguish atopic transverse myelitis from other causes of intramedullary cord
