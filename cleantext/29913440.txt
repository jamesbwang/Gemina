  To test the performance of a new fixative for pap smear collection for liquid-based cervical cytology , CellPreserv ® and compare it with the commercially available , PreservCyt ® used in the diagnosis and detection of human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>). Seven hundred twenty five women participated in this study after signing an informed consent. The specimens were collected using a traditional device , agitated in PBS , and equally divided in both fixatives. The slides were prepared routinely , stained by Papanicolaou , examined blindly by 2 cytologists , and reviewed by one cytopathologist. To search for HPV<pathogen> , 1,000 μL from each fixative was taken and processed by polymerase chain reaction. Considering the adequacy of samples , both fixatives had similar results- 0.33 and 0.32 % of the cases unsatisfactory for PreservCyt ® and CellPreserv ® , respectively. Considering the 701 satisfactory cases and comparing the new fixative to the traditional fixative , there was 99.3 % concordance between both. The results regarding the HPV<pathogen> detection was 100 % concordant between the 2 fixatives. The new methanol-based fixative , CellPreserv ® , is cheaper and equally efficient for treating cervical cancer screening and for HPV<pathogen> detection , and can be safely used by the health system prevailing in low-income countries.
