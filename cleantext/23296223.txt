  To compare the abundance of vitreous proteins between the patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR) and idiopathic macular hole ( IMH). In this study , we performed mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics analysis of vitreous samples from type 2 diabetic patients with PDR ( n = 9) and IMH subjects ( n = 9) and identified the abundance of 610 proteins. Out of 610 proteins , 64 proteins ( Group A) were unique to PDR patients , while 212 proteins ( Group B) could be identified in IMH vitreous only. Among the other 334 proteins that could be detected in both PDR and IMH eyes , 62 proteins differed significantly ( p < 0.05 , fold change > 2) , which included 52 proteins ( Group C) and 10 proteins ( Group D) over- and under-expressed in PDR vitreous compared with the control. All proteins in these four groups were counted as significant proteins in our study. We identified and quantified 610 proteins in total , which included 338 significant proteins in our study. Protein distribution analysis demonstrated a clear separation of protein expression in PDR and IMH. The protein function analysis illustrated that immunity and transport related proteins might be associated with PDR.
