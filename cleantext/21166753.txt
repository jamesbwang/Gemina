  Transcriptome expression studies identified distinct muscle invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC) subtypes closely related with breast cancer subclasses. Here we developed a sensitive quantification method for MIBC subclassification ( luminal , basal , p53-like). In addition , the subtype specific expression of drug targets has been investigated. Absolute quantification ( nCounter) of a 64-gene panel was performed on MIBC patients ( n = 47) treated exclusively with radical cystectomy ( RC). In conjunction of 170 MIBCs from 3 independent cohorts , a minimal set of consensus genes has been established. Survival of the consensus subtypes has been assessed by multivariate analysis. Relevant drug targets were tested for their subtype specificity in a clustering independent assessment. A reduced 36-gene panel stably clustered into 3 subtypes throughout the cohorts ( luminal , basal , infiltrated). Patients treated by RC only , showed worst 8-year disease specific survival ( DSS) for the luminal subtype in contrast to the infiltrated subtype ( 17 % vs. 73 % , p = 0.011). In multivariate analyses , the risk stratification based on luminal versus not-luminal MIBC proved to be an independent predictor for DSS superior to the TNM system in patients with RC. Drug targets ( e.g.. This MIBC subtype screening predicted survival and allowed an analysis of subtype specific drug targets , thus being a powerful tool for the translation of personalized MIBC treatment concepts.
