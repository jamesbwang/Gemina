  The photoreactivity of 9-borafluorene-based , C,C-chelated organoborates was investigated. Unlike the related tetraarylborates , the charge-transfer transitions imparted by the biphenyl chelate lead to selective insertion of one aryl substituent into the endocyclic B-C bond of the 9-borafluorene moiety , resulting in the formation of boratanorcaradienes. This photoreaction likely proceeds according to a Zimmerman rearrangement , which is analogous to one of the initially proposed mechanisms for tetraarylborates and provides additional insight into these long-debated photochemical reactions.
