  Rotavirus<pathogen> ( RV) inner capsid VP6 protein is a potential non-live vaccine candidate due to high degree of conservation and immunogenicity , and ability to self-assemble into oligomeric structures , including nanotubes. These VP6 structures induce strong humoral and T cell immunity and protect mice against RV challenge. It has been suggested that intracellular neutralization by IgA antibody and VP6-specific CD4
