  The A hospital-based case-control study , including 1,121 cases and 1,056 controls was conducted to evaluate the association between eight selected single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) ( rs35514263 in Individuals with rs189037 A allele were found to have a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer , compared to those carrying G allele ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.23 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.02-1.47 in dominant model and OR = 1.14 , 95 % CI = 1.01-1.29 in additive model). And this risk is more pronounced in elder people ( > 69) , rectum , early stage and poorly grade. In addition , bioinformatic analysis showed that rs189037 may change the secondary structure. Our results provide the evidence that rs189037 in
