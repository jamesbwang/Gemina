  Primary small cell gastric carcinomas ( SCGC) are rare tumors with an aggressive nature , characterized by early , widespread metastases and poor overall prognosis. SCGC shares similar clinicopathological and molecular characteristics with small cell lung carcinoma and is usually treated in a similar manner. Here , two cases of SCGC in young Caucasian male patients are presented. One patient had metastatic and the other locoregional disease. Multimodal treatment was applied in each case; the resulting survival time was 20.2 months in the patient with initially locoregional disease whereas the remains alive and disease-free 20 months after initial diagnosis. A review of the literature is also presented.
