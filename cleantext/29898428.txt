  We examined whether patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) lacking risk factors are enrolled in therapeutic trials and assessed their clinical characteristics and outcomes. We performed a secondary analysis of patient-level data pooled from the ARMA , ALVEOLI , FACTT , ALTA and EDEN ARDSNet randomized controlled trials obtained from the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute. We compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes ( before and after adjustment using Poisson regression model) of ARDS patients with versus without risk factors. Of 3733 patients with ARDS , 81 ( 2.2 %) did not have an identifiable risk factor. Patients without risk factors were younger , had lower baseline severity of illness , were more likely to have the ARDS resolve rapidly ( i.e. , within 24 h) ( p < 0.001) and they had more ventilator-free days ( median 21; p = 0.003) , more intensive care unit-free days ( 18; p = 0.010) , and more non-pulmonary organ failure-free days ( 24; p < 0.001) than comparators ( 17 , 14 and 18 , respectively). Differences persisted after adjustment for potential confounders. Patients with ARDS without identifiable risk factors are enrolled in therapeutic trials and may have better outcomes , including a higher proportion of rapidly resolving ARDS , than those with risk factors.
