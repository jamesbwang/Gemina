  With the widespread use of endoscopy , small and low-grade type 3 gastric neuroendocrine tumours ( NETs) are increasingly being detected. The clinicopathological features , biological behaviour and appropriate treatment strategy for these NETs remain unclear. Patients with biopsy-proven gastric NET and a normal fasting serum gastrin level were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Clinicopathological features and long-term outcome of local resection for type 3 NETs were reviewed retrospectively and compared according to tumour grade. Some 32 patients with type 3 gastric NETs were included ( 25 patients with NET grade G1 , 5 with G2 and 2 with G3). Pathological tumour size was 2 路 0 cm or less in 30 patients. All tumours were well differentiated , even G3 lesions<symptom> , and all tumours but one were confined to the submucosal layer. G1 NETs were significantly smaller and had a significantly lower lymphovascular invasion rate than G2 and G3 NETs. Twenty-two patients with a G1 NET without lymphovascular invasion were treated with wedge or endoscopic resection. After a median follow-up of 59 ( range 6-102) months , no patient with a G1 NET of 1 路 5 cm or smaller developed recurrence and one patient with a G1 NET larger than 1 路 5 cm had recurrence in a perigastric lymph node. Among seven patients with a G2 or G3 NET , two had lymph node metastasis and one had liver metastases. Low-grade type 3 gastric NET has non-aggressive features and a favourable prognosis. Wedge or endoscopic resection may be a valid option for patients with type 3 gastric G1 NET no larger than 1 路 5 cm without lymphovascular invasion.
