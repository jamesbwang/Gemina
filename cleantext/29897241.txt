  Historical reconstruction of mercury ( Hg) accumulation in natural archives , especially lake sediments , has been essential to understanding human perturbation of the global Hg cycle. Here we present a high-resolution chronology of Hg accumulation between 1727 and 1996 in a varved sediment core from the Pettaquamscutt River Estuary ( PRE) , Rhode Island. Mercury accumulation is examined relative to ( 1) historic deposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) and lead ( Pb) and its isotopes (
