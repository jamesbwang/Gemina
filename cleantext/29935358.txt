  China is a major country producing and using hazardous chemicals. Unfortunately , the hazardous chemical industry is still one of the most high-risk industries in China. In recent years , especially after two devastating hazardous chemical accidents , namely `` Qingdao 11.2 Crude Oil Leaking and Explosion Accident '' and `` Tianjin Port 8.12 Fire and Explosion Accident '' which occurred in 2013 and 2015 respectively , China has attached great importance to hazardous chemical safety. The period between 2016 and 2017 is a crucial period for the future direction of hazardous chemical safety in China because China released a series of important government documents ( such as ` Thirteenth Five-Year ( 2016-2020) Plan for Hazardous Chemical Safety ' and ` Comprehensive Plan for Hazardous Chemical Safety Management ( December 2016-November 2019) ') to promote hazardous chemical safety in the future. What is the future development of China 's hazardous chemical safety? To answer this question , this paper attempts to briefly analyze and introduce the opportunities , problems , challenges and tasks of the future of safety with hazardous chemical industrial activities in China , according to the current situation of hazardous chemical safety in China and using the latest government documents and studies. Obviously , this study can provide useful evidence and suggestions for the future of safety management in the hazardous chemical industry both within China and in other countries.
