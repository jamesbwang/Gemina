  There are no reliable markers to assess brain injury in neonates following cardiac surgery. We examine ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1 ( UCHL1) and phosphorylated axonal neurofilament heavy chain ( pNF-H) , neuronal-specific biomarkers released following axonal and cortical injury , in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( DHCA). Twenty-six patients younger than three months were prospectively enrolled ( CPB only , n = 12 and DHCA , n = 14). Healthy newborns ( n = 22) served as the control. Blood samples were collected preoperatively and postoperatively upon intensive care unit admission ( hour 0) and subsequently at 12 , 24 , 36 , and 48 hours. Serum was tested for UCHL1 and pNF-H using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Concomitant arterial blood gas , lactate , and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS) monitoring were performed. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1 showed a significant rise at 0 hours in the DHCA group compared to baseline ( 74.9 ± 13.7 pg/mL vs 33.9 ± 37.3 pg/mL , P < .0001). Levels returned to baseline at 12 hours. There was an early rise in UCHL1 at 0 hours in the CPB group , P = .09. Phosphorylated axonal neurofilament heavy chain was decreased at 0 hours in both the CPB and DHCA groups compared to baseline , P = .06. There was no difference between control and baseline levels of UCHL1 ( P = .9) or pNF-H ( P = .77). Decreased NIRS was observed in the DHCA group at 0 hours ( 57.3 ± 10.5) versus baseline ( 64.2 ± 12.3) , but not significant ( P = .21). There was no correlation between biomarkers and NIRS at 0 hours. A rapid rise in UCHL1 levels was observed in the DHCA group , suggesting that it may be a marker for acute brain injury. Follow-up with neurodevelopmental studies is ongoing.
