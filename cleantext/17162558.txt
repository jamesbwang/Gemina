  Hypoxic cells dynamically translocate during tumor growth and after radiotherapy. The most desirable direction for therapy targeting hypoxic cells is combining imaging and therapy ( theranostics) , which may help realize personalized medicine. Here , we conducted cancer radiotheranostics targeting carbonic anhydrase-IX ( CA-IX) , which is overexpressed in many kinds of hypoxic cancer cells , using low-molecular-weight
