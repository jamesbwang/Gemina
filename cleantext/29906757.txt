  This study reports the transport characteristics of the organometallic anticancer compound oxaliplatin and its derivatives in natural soil-water environments. Although pharmaceuticals and their derivatives have for many years been detected in water resources , and linked to toxicological impacts on ecological systems , their transport in soil and groundwater is not fully understood. Specifically , studies that describe transport of organometallic pharmaceuticals in porous media are rare , and the transport characteristics of platinum complexes have received little attention. Oxaliplatin transport was studied in sand , as a function of two added natural chelators ( citrate and humic acid) , and in soil , under four continuously monitored , environmentally-relevant redox conditions: oxic , nitrate reducing , iron reducing and methanogenic. In sand , oxaliplatin species retention was about 7 % , and affected only mildly by added citrate , and by humic acid under buffered pH. Transport with unbuffered humic acid was affected significantly by pH variations , and exhibited strong retention at pH < 8. In soil , unexpectedly similar breakthrough patterns of oxaliplatin species were found for all redox conditions , exhibiting linear , reversible retention of 79-87 %. The strongest retention was observed under iron reducing conditions , whereas the weakest retention was under oxic conditions. Increased cation activity appears to promote weaker sorption. The results indicate that soil composition is the leading factor affecting oxaliplatin species mobility and fate in the soil-water environment , followed by the weaker factors of redox conditions and cation activities.
