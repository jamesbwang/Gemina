  Typha is a cosmopolitan aquatic plant genus that includes species with widespread distributions. It is a relatively ancient genus with an abundant fossil record dating back to the Paleogene. However , the details of its biogeographic history have remained unclear until now. In this study , we present a revised molecular phylogeny using sequences of seven chloroplast DNA markers from nine species sampled from various regions in order to infer the biogeographic history of the genus. Two clades were recovered with robust support. Typha minima and T. elephantina comprised one clade , and the other clade included the remaining seven species , which represented a polytomy of four robustly supported subclades. Two widespread species , T. angustifolia and T. domingensis , were revealed to be paraphyletic , indicating the need for taxonomic revision. Divergence time estimation suggested that Typha had a mid-Eocene crown origin , and its diversification occurred in the Middle and Late Miocene. Ancestral area reconstruction showed that Typha possibly originated from eastern Eurasia. Both dispersal via the Beringian Land Bridge and recent transoceanic dispersal may have influenced the intercontinental distribution of Typha species.
