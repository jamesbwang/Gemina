  We aimed to associate a coronary artery disease ( CAD) presence and severity with endothelial dysfunction ( ED) , carotid intima media thickness ( CIMT) and Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor ( TFPI). ED has a central role in atherosclerosis. CIMT and TFPI activity are also related with atherosclerosis and CAD. In our prospective observational study , 50 patients had CAD and 30 had normal coronary arteries. Endothelial function was evaluated by endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD) and nitroglycerine-mediated dilatation ( NMD) measurements. CIMT and Serum TFPI levels were also measured. TFPI was a statistically significant determinant between the two groups with an increased level in CAD ( +) group ( 84.9 ± 19.3 vs 70.2 ± 14.7 , p = 0.001). There was a positive correlation between CIMT and Gensini ( r = 0.34 , p = 0.014). There was a strong negative correlation between Gensini and FMD-NMD , statistically significant ( FMD: r = -0.715 , p < 0.001; NMD: r = -0.718 , p < 0.001). We observed that ED , increased CIMT and TFPI levels were associated with CAD. Additionally , increased CIMT measurements and decreased FMD and NMD values had a positive correlation with GSS ( Tab. 4 , Fig. 6 , Ref. 50).
