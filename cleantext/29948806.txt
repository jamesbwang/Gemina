  There is a lack of comprehensive view of the association between acute exacerbation of COPD ( AECOPD) and the risk of acute cardiovascular events. To determine the association of AECOPD with 30-day and 1-year incidences of acute cardiovascular event. Self-controlled case series analysis using population-based datasets from three US states from 2005 through 2011. Patients aged â‰¥ 40 years with AECOPD. The primary outcome was a composite of an ED visit or hospitalization for acute cardiovascular events , including acute myocardial infarction , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , pulmonary embolism , and stroke. We compared the incidence of each patient 's acute cardiovascular event during the first 30-day period before the index AECOPD ( 30-day reference period) in comparison with that during the 30-day period after the index AECOPD. Likewise , with the 1-year period before the index AECOPD as reference , we also estimated incidence rate ratios ( IRRs) for each patient 's outcomes during 1-year period after the index AECOPD. Overall , there were 362,867 patients with an ED visit or hospitalization for AECOPD. Compared with the 30-day reference period , the incidence of acute cardiovascular event in the 30-day period after the AECOPD was significantly higher ( IRR , 1.34; 95 % CI , 1.30-1.39; P < 0.001). Likewise , compared with the 1-year reference period , the incidence during the 1-year period after the AECOPD was also higher ( IRR , 1.20; 95 % CI , 1.18-1.22; P < 0.001). For each of acute cardiovascular conditions , the associations remained significant ( all P < 0.05). AECOPD was associated with increased 30-day and 1-year incidences of acute cardiovascular event.
