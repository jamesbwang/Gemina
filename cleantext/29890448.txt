  Documenting the implementation of effective real-world programmes is considered an important step to support the translation of evidence into practice. Thus , the aim of this study was to identify factors influencing the adoption , implementation and maintenance of the Svendborgproject ( SP)- an effective real-world programme comprising schools to implement triple the amount of physical education ( PE) in pre-school to sixth grade in six primary schools in the municipality of Svendborg , Denmark. SP has been maintained for ten years and scaled up to all municipal schools since it was initiated in 2008. The Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation and Maintenance framework ( RE-AIM) was applied as an analytic tool through a convergent mixed method triangulation design. Results show that SP has been implemented with high fidelity and become an established part of the municipality and school identity. The successful implementation and dissemination of the programme has been enabled through the introduction of a predominantly bottom-up approach combined with simple non-negotiable requirements. The results show that this combination has led to a better fit of programmes to the individual school context while still obtaining high implementation fidelity. Finally , the early integration of research has legitimated and benefitted the programme.
