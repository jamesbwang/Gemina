  Polyploidization always induces a series of changes in genome , transcriptome and epigenetics , of which changes in gene expression are the immediate causes of genotype alterations of polyploid plants. In our previous study on strawberry polyploidization , genes related to photosynthesis were found to undergo changes in gene expression and DNA methylation. Therefore , we chose 11 genes that were closely related to plant photosynthesis and analysed their expression during strawberry hybridization and chromosome doubling. Most genes of pentaploids showed expression levels between parents and were more similar to F. × ananassa. Gene expression levels of decaploids were higher than those of pentaploids and F. × ananassa. Different types of photosynthesis-related genes responded differently to hybridization and chromosome doubling. Chloroplast genes and regulatory genes showed complex responses. Structural genes of the photosynthetic system were expressed at a constant level and displayed a clear dosage effect. The methylation levels of one CG site on SIGE , which regulates expression of chloroplast genes , were negatively correlated with gene expression. In pentaploids and decaploids , more transcripts were from F. × ananassa than from F. viridis. The ratio of transcripts from from F. × ananassa to those from F. viridis was close to the ratio ( 4:1) of the genome of F. × ananassa to that of F. viridis in pentaploids and decaploids , but there were also some exceptions with obvious deviation.
