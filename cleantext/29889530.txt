  Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD) consists of a persistent obstruction of lower-extremity arteries further from the aortic bifurcation attributable to atherosclerosis. PAD is correlated with an elevated risk of morbidity and mortality as well as of deterioration of the quality of life with claudication and chronic leg ischemia being the most frequent complications. Therapeutic angiogenesis is a promising therapeutic strategy that aims to restore the blood flow to the ischemic limb. In this context , assessing the efficacy of pro-angiogenic treatment using a reliable noninvasive imaging technique would greatly benefit the implementation of this therapeutic approach. Herein , we describe the angiogenesis and perfusion recovery characteristics of a mouse model of PAD via in vivo positron emission tomography ( PET) imaging of CD146 expression. For that , ischemia was generated by ligation and excision of the right femoral artery of Balb/C mice and confirmed through laser Doppler imaging. The angiogenic process , induced by ischemia , was noninvasively monitored and quantified through PET imaging of CD146 expression in the injured leg using a
