  To determine whether quantitative methods could separate golfers with a possible dystonic cause of the `` yips '' from those that appear to be non-dystonic. 27 golfers completed 10 two-handed and 10 right hand only putts. Surface EMG assessed forearm muscle co-contraction and motion detectors monitored wrist and putter movements. Based on videotape review , golfers were grouped into those with yips of dystonic etiology , those with the yips non-dystonic , and those with no yips. On video review of two-handed putting , five golfers had yips that appeared to be dystonic , nine had yips that did not appear to be dystonic , and 13 had no yips. During two-handed putting co-occurrence of a yipped putt and wrist flexor/extensor and/or pronator/supinator co-contraction was significantly more frequent in those with dystonic yips. The dystonic group had no increase in the number of yipped putts or yips with co-contraction when putting right hand only , while the non-dystonic group had significantly more yipped putts and more yipped putts with co-contraction with right hand only. Quantitative methods were identified that appear to identify golfers with a dystonic etiology for the yips. It is not just the frequency of yips nor just specific motion patterns alone , rather it is also a combination of yips with co-occurring co-contraction when putting with two hands , and then right hand only , that distinguished this possible etiology. Despite being a small study , identifying a dystonic pattern , even in a non-pressure indoor setting , may aid in assessment and possible monitoring of treatment.
