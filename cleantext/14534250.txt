  Although a direct link has long been suspected between systemic immune responses and neuronal injuries after stroke , it is unclear which immune cells play an important role. A question remains as to whether the blood brain barrier ( BBB) is transiently disrupted after circulatory arrest to allow peripheral immune cells to enter brain parenchyma. Here , we developed a clinically relevant cardiac arrest and resuscitation model in mice to investigate the BBB integrity using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging. Changes in immune signals in the brain and periphery were assayed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Quantitative variance maps from T1-weighted difference images before and after blood-pool contrast clearance revealed BBB disruptions immediately after resuscitation and one day after reperfusion. Time profiles of hippocampal CA1 neuronal injuries correlated with the morphological changes of microglia activation. Cytotoxic T cells , CD11b
