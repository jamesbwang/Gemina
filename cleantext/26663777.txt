  Thyroid imaging reporting and data system ( TIRADS) is the assessment of a risk stratification of thyroid nodules<symptom> , usually using a score. However , there is no consensus as to the version of TIRADS for reporting the results of thyroid ultrasound in clinic. The objective of this study is to develop a practical TIRADS with which to categorize thyroid nodules<symptom> and stratify their malignant risk. A TIRADS scoring system was developed to provide more decision levels than standard scoring through the selection of the ultrasound features which include the calcification shape , margins , taller-than-wide , internal echo , blood flow quantization of features , setting of the weight , and calculation of the score. Ultimately , the accuracy of our TIRADS was evaluated by comparing with the results of current vision of TIRADS and thyroid radiologist in 153 patients who had US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Classification results showed that the total accuracy reached 97 % ( 100 % of malignant and 95 % of the benign) in 153 cases ( benign: 78 , malignant: 75). The percentages of malignancy is defined in our TIRADS were as follows: TIRADS 2 ( 0 % malignancy) , TIRADS 3 ( 3.6 % malignancy) , TIRADS 4 ( 17-75 % malignancy) , and TIRADS 5 ( 98 % malignancy). We established a novel TIRADS to predict the malignancy risk of the thyroid nodules<symptom> based on six categories US features by a scoring system , which included a standardized vocabulary and score and a quantified risk assessment. The results showed that objective quantitative classification of thyroid nodules<symptom> by our TIRADS can be useful in guiding management decisions.
