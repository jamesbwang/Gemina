  Sensorimotor research is currently challenging the dominant understanding of autism as a deficit in the cognitive ability to ` mindread '. This marks an emerging shift in autism research from a focus on the structure and processes of the mind to a focus on autistic behavior as grounded in the body. Contemporary researchers in sensorimotor differences in autism call for a reconciliation between the scientific understanding of autism and the first-person experience of autistic individuals. I argue that fulfilling this ambition requires a phenomenological understanding of the body as it presents itself in ordinary experience , namely as the subject of experience rather than a physical object. On this basis , I investigate how the phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty can be employed as a frame of understanding for bodily experience in autism. Through a phenomenological analysis of Tito Mukhopadhyay 's autobiographical work , How can I talk if my lips do n't move ( 2009) , I illustrate the relevance and potential of phenomenological philosophy in autism research , arguing that this approach enables a deeper understanding of bodily and subjective experiences related to autism.
