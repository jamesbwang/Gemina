  TCP proteins , the plant-specific transcription factors , are involved in the regulation of multiple aspects of plant development among different species , such as leaf development , branching , and flower symmetry. However , thus far , the roles of TCPs in legume , especially in nodulation are still not clear. In this study , a genome-wide analysis of
