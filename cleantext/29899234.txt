  Compound sinusoidal grid surface with nanometric finish plays a significant role in modern systems and precision calibrator , which can make the systems smaller , the system structure more simple , reduce the cost , and promote the performance of the systems , but it is difficult to design and fabricate by traditional methods. In this paper , a compound freeform surface constructed by a paraboloidal base surface and sinusoidal grid feature surface is designed and machined by slow tool servo ( STS) assisted with single point diamond turning ( SPDT). A novel combination of the constant angle and constant arc-length method is presented to optimize the cutting tool path. The machining error prediction model is analyzed for fabricating the compound sinusoidal grid surface. A compound sinusoidal grid surface with 0.03 mm amplitude and period of 4 is designed and cutting process is simulated by use of MATLAB software , machining experiment is done on ultra-precision machine tool , the surface profile and topography are measured by Taylor Hobson and Keyence VR-3200 , respectively. After dealing with the measurement data of compound freeform surface , form accuracy 4.25 & mu; m in Peak Village value ( PV) , and surface roughness 89 nm in Ra are obtained for the machined surface. From the theoretical analysis and experimental results , it can be seen that the proposed method is a reasonable choice for fabricating the compound sinusoidal grid surface.
