  This study examined the effects of treadmill exercise on the methadone withdrawal- induced locomotor sensitization , the ventral tegmental area ( VTA) and ventral pallidum<pathogen> ( VP) BDNF levels in morphine withdrawn rats receiving methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT). The rats were chronically treated with bi-daily doses ( 10 mg/kg , at 12 h intervals) of morphine for 14 days. The exercising rats receiving MMT were forced to run on a motorized treadmill for 30 days during morphine withdrawal. Then , rats were exposed to a 14-day methadone withdrawal period , without any exercise and then challenged with morphine ( 1 mg/kg , ip) and evaluated for locomotor activity. Also , the VTA-VP BDNF levels were assessed before and after receiving MMT. The sedentary morphine-dependent rats receiving MMT and morphine-dependent rats receiving saline challenged to morphine exhibited a higher level of locomotor activity compared to Sal/Sal/Sed group after withdrawal of drug. While , the level of locomotor activity was lower in the D/Meth/Sed than in D/Sal/Sed rats. The VP BDNF level and the locomotors response were higher and lower , respectively in the D/Meth/Sed and D/Sal/Exc than the D/Sal/Sed rats. Exercise had no effect on the locomotors response and the VP BDNF levels in morphine-dependent rats receiving MMT. Our results showed that the sedentary morphine-dependent rats challenged to morphine enhanced the morphine-induced hyperlocomotion , whereas decreased the VP BDNF levels. MMT resulted in a persistent of locomotor sensitization caused by morphine withdrawal , though milder. Exercise had no effect on the locomotors response and the VTA-VP BDNF levels in the D/Meth/Exc.
