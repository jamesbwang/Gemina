  This article examines the work of two authors who represent academic production on collective health from 1970 to 1980: Madel Luz and Emerson Merhy. Their theoretical production was based on Marxist studies and Michel Foucault , and centered on history. The object of this analysis was this particular aspect , which became important to the field of collective health , since the authors broke with previous positivist and evolutionist thinking on health. Although Luz and Merhy reiterated the ideas and methodological approaches of their predecessors , they were part of the group that launched a critical historiography in the field of health. Studying works like these builds understanding on the relevance of historicity in the relationship between collective health , politics , learning , and practice.
