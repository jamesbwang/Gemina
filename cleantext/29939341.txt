  With the rise of genome- scale datasets there has been a call for increased data scrutiny and careful selection of loci appropriate for attempting the resolution of a phylogenetic problem. Such loci are desired to maximize phylogenetic information content while minimizing the risk of homoplasy. Theory posits the existence of characters that evolve under such an optimum rate , and efforts to determine optimal rates of inference have been a cornerstone of phylogenetic experimental design for over two decades. However , both theoretical and empirical investigations of optimal rates have varied dramatically in their conclusions: spanning no relationship to a tight relationship between the rate of change and phylogenetic utility. Here we synthesize these apparently contradictory views , demonstrating both empirical and theoretical conditions under which each is correct. We find that optimal rates of characters-not genes-are generally robust to most experimental design decisions. Moreover , consideration of site rate heterogeneity within a given locus is critical to accurate predictions of utility. Factors such as taxon sampling or the targeted number of characters providing support for a topology are additionally critical to the predictions of phylogenetic utility based on the rate of character change. Further , optimality of rates and predictions of phylogenetic utility are not equivalent , demonstrating the need for further development of comprehensive theory of phylogenetic experimental design.
