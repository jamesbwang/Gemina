  Calcium channel blockers are among the first-line drugs for treatment of hypertension ( HTN). S-amlodipine ( S-AM) , an S-enantiomer of amlodipine , is available in India and in other countries like China , Korea , Russia , Ukraine , and Nepal. Being clinically researched for nearly two decades , we performed in-depth review of S-AM. This review discusses clinical evidence from total 42 studies ( 26 randomized controlled trials , 14 observational studies , and 2 meta-analyses) corroborating over 7400 patients treated with S-AM. Efficacy and safety of S-AM in HTN in comparison to racemic amlodipine , used as monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensives , efficacy in angina , and pleiotropic benefits with S-AM , are discussed in this review.
