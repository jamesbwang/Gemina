  Recombination hotspots in a genome are unevenly distributed. Hotspots are regions in a genome that show higher rates of meiotic recombinations. Computational methods for recombination hotspot prediction often use sophisticated features that are derived from physico-chemical or structure based properties of nucleotides. In this paper , we propose iRSpot-SF that uses sequence based features which are computationally cheap to generate. Four feature groups are used in our method: k-mer composition , gapped k-mer composition , TF-IDF of k-mers and reverse complement k-mer composition. We have used recursive feature elimination to select 17 top features for hotspot prediction. Our analysis shows the superiority of gapped k-mer composition and reverse complement k-mer composition features over others. We have used SVM with RBF kernel as a classification algorithm. We have tested our algorithm on standard benchmark datasets. Compared to other methods iRSpot-SF is able to produce significantly better results in terms of accuracy , Mathew 's Correlation Coefficient and sensitivity which are 84.58 % , 0.6941 and 84.57 %. We have made our method readily available to use as a python based tool and made the datasets and source codes available at: https://github.com/abdlmaruf/iRSpot-SF. An web application is developed based on iRSpot-SF and freely available to use at: http://irspot.pythonanywhere.com/server.html.
