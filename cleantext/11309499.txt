  Systematic study of the regulatory mechanisms of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Progenitor Cell ( HSPC) self-renewal is fundamentally important for understanding hematopoiesis and for manipulating HSPCs for therapeutic purposes. Previously , we have characterized gene expression and identified important transcription factors ( TFs) regulating the switch between self-renewal and differentiation in a multipotent Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell ( HPC) line , EML ( Erythroid , Myeloid , and Lymphoid) cells. Herein , we report binding maps for additional TFs ( SOX4 and STAT3) by using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP)- Sequencing , to address the underlying mechanisms regulating self-renewal properties of lineage-CD34 + subpopulation ( Lin-CD34 + EML cells). Furthermore , we applied the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin ( ATAC)- Sequencing to globally identify the open chromatin regions associated with TF binding in the self-renewing Lin-CD34 + EML cells. Mass spectrometry ( MS) was also used to quantify protein relative expression levels. Finally , by integrating the protein-protein interaction database , we built an expanded transcriptional regulatory and interaction network. We found that MAPK ( Mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway and TGF-Î²/SMAD signaling pathway components were highly enriched among the binding targets of these TFs in Lin-CD34 + EML cells. The present study integrates regulatory information at multiple levels to paint a more comprehensive picture of the HSPC self-renewal mechanisms.
