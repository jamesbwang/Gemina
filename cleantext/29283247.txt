  Photoacoustic imaging combines the merits of ultrasound imaging and optical imaging that allows a fascinating imaging paradigm with deeper tissue penetration than optical imaging and higher spatial resolution than ultrasound imaging. Herein , we develop a supramolecular hybrid material composed of graphene oxide ( GO) and a pillar ( 6) arene-based host-guest complex ( CP6 âŠƒ PyN) , which can be used as a ultrasound ( US) and photoacoustic ( PA) signal nanoamplifier. Triggered by the near-infrared ( NIR) light mediated photothermal effect , CO
