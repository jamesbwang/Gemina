  Gene regulatory networks underlie biological function and cellular physiology. Alternative splicing ( AS) is a fundamental step in gene regulatory networks and plays a key role in development and disease. In addition to the identification of aberrant AS events , an increasing number of studies are focusing on molecular determinants of AS , including genetic and epigenetic regulators. We review here recent efforts to identify various deregulated AS events as well as their molecular determinants that alter biological functions , and discuss clinical features of AS and their druggable potential.
