  Suicidal thinking ( ST) is common in people with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. It is relevant as it can be associated with suicidal attempts , and typically reflects significant suffering. While little is known about the psychological processes that contribute to ST , current psychological models , such as the Psychological Flexibility ( PF) model , could help guide further investigation. This study investigates relations between ST and components of PF in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Participants were 424 adults attending treatment for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in the UK. Included in measures administered before treatment were standardized measures of depression<symptom> , pain , pain-related interference , and measures of PF , including acceptance , cognitive defusion , committed action , and self-as-context. An item from the measure of depression<symptom> was used to reflect ST. A large proportion of the sample reported ST , 45.7 %. ST was uncorrelated with participant background characteristic , medications taken , or pain intensity. However , it was correlated with the presence of widespread pain , pain-related interference , and depression<symptom> Each component of PF was found to be significantly negatively associated with ST , as predicted. General acceptance correlated with ST at a level equal to that achieved by the depression<symptom> score. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression general acceptance and committed action remained significantly uniquely associated with it. This preliminary study suggests for the first time that components of PF are associated with part of a pattern of suicidal behaviour in people with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. They may be relevant for reducing avoidance in general and providing more positive behavioural options. This study provides evidence that components of psychological flexibility are associated with a reduced frequency of suicidal thinking in people with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Treatments targeting psychological flexibility may help mitigate the impact of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> on suicidal thinking.
