  Swimming is a popular activity in Aotearoa-New Zealand ( NZ). Two variables that strongly influence swimming suitability of waters are faecal contamination , as indicated by the bacterium<pathogen> Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , and visual clarity as it affects aesthetics and safety with respect to submerged hazards. We show that E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and visual clarity are inversely related overall in NZ rivers ( R = -0.54) , and more strongly related in many individual rivers , while similar ( but positive) correlations apply also to turbidity. This finding , apparently reflecting co-mobilisation of faecal contamination and fine sediment , suggests that visual clarity , measured or estimated from appearance of submerged features , should be a valuable indicator of faecal contamination status and ( more generally) swimming suitability. If swimmers were to avoid river waters < 1.6 m black disc visibility ( a long-established NZ guideline for swimming) they would also avoid microbial hazards ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> < 550 cfu/100 mL about 99 % of the time in NZ rivers). However , urban-affected rivers might sometimes be microbially contaminated when still clear. Water management agencies should measure visual clarity together with E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in river surveillance. Real-time information on swimming suitability could then be based on continuous monitoring of turbidity locally calibrated to both visual clarity and
