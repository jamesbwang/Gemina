  Endothelial cell senescence is regarded as a vital characteristic of cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs). Elevated palmitate ( PA) is an independent risk factor of CVDs , but its role in the endothelial cell senescence is currently unknown. During the course of studying pro-senescent role of PA , we discovered a key role of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR in endothelial senescence. Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) to PA induced cell senescence , characterized by increased levels of senescence-associated β-galactose glucosidase ( SA-β-gal) activity , excessive reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production , impaired cellular proliferation , and G1 phase arrest. This phenomenon is associated with increase of PKR autophosphorylation and the decreased activity of silent information regulator 1 ( Sirt1) , a pivotal anti-senescent factor. PKR inactivation by PKR small interfering RNA ( si-PKR) or its phosphorylation inhibitor 2-AP significantly attenuated PA induced HUVEC senescence via reversing Sirt1 activity and its downstream signaling. Moreover , to study the regulatory mechanism between PKR and Sirt1 , we found PKR promotes JNK activation to inhibit Sirt1 activity and this effect could be reversed by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. These findings , for the first time , provide evidences that PKR mediates PA-induced HUVEC senescence through inhibiting Sirt1 signaling. Our study provides a novel insight into the actions and mechanisms of PKR in endothelial senescence.
