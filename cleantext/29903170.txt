  To explore the association of silent information regulator 1 ( SIRT1) rs12778366 and apolipoprotein C3 ( APOC3) rs2854116 gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). One hundred and thirty two NAFLD patients and 252 healthy controls were enrolled in our present study according to the ultrasound diagnosis and physical examination. Venousblood samples were obtained in the morning after an overnight fast , and the samples were used to analyze the biochemical index , relating to hepatic enzymes , blood lipid and blood glucose metabolism. DNA was extracted from whole blood , and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) and mass ARRAY were used to determine the genotypes of target genes. Compared with TT genotype carriers , the SIRT1 genotype rs12778366 increased the risk of NAFLD , with OR = 1. 126 ( 95 % CI 0. 673-1. 886) ( P > 0. 05). The APOC3rs2854116 TC + TT genotype increased the risk of NAFLD compared with CC genotype ( OR = 1. 044 , 95 % CI 0. 601-1. 814 , P > 0. 05). The adjusted odds ratios had no significant changes after adjusting for gender , age and BMI. Logistic regression showed that TG , body mass index ( BMI) , FPG , WC and UA were the independent risk factors for NAFLD ( P < 0. 05) , but the polymorphisms of SIRT1 rs12778366 and APOC3 rs2854116 had no significant relationship with the risk of NAFLD. SIRT1 rs12778366 and APOC3 rs2854116 polymorphisms were not associated with NAFLD susceptibility.
