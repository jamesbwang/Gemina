  Although evidence exists for the efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation programmes to reduce morbidity and mortality among patients with cardiovascular disease , cardiac rehabilitation programmes are underused. We aimed systematically to review the evidence from prospective cohort studies on factors associated with non-participation in and/or dropping out from cardiac rehabilitation programmes. MedLine , Embase , Scopus , Open Grey and Cochrane Database were searched for relevant publications from inception to February 2018. Search terms included ( a) coronary heart disease and other cardiac conditions; ( b) cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention; and ( c) non-participation in and/or dropout. Databases were searched following the PRISMA statement. Study selection , data extraction and the assessment of study quality were performed in duplicate. We selected 43 studies with a total of 63,425 patients from 10 different countries that met the inclusion criteria. Factors associated with non-participation in and dropout from cardiac rehabilitation were grouped into six broad categories: intrapersonal factors , clinical factors , interpersonal factors , logistical factors , cardiac rehabilitation programme factors and health system factors. We found that clinical factors , logistical factors and health system factors were the main factors assessed for non-participation in cardiac rehabilitation. We also found differences between the factors associated with non-participation and dropout. Several factors were determinant for non-participation in and dropout from cardiac rehabilitation. These findings could be useful to clinicians and policymakers for developing interventions aimed at improving participation and completion of cardiac rehabilitation , such as E-health or home-based delivery programmes.
