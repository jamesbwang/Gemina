  In recent years , an increasing number of studies have reported the presence of plant miRNAs in human samples , which resulted in a hypothesis asserting the existence of plant-derived exogenous microRNA ( xenomiR). However , this hypothesis is not widely accepted in the scientific community due to possible sample contamination and the small sample size with lack of rigorous statistical analysis. This study provides a systematic statistical test that can validate ( or invalidate) the plant-derived xenomiR hypothesis by analyzing 388 small RNA sequencing data from human samples in 11 types of body fluids/tissues. A total of 166 types of plant miRNAs were found in at least one human sample , of which 14 plant miRNAs represented more than 80 % of the total plant miRNAs abundance in human samples. Plant miRNA profiles were characterized to be tissue-specific in different human samples. Meanwhile , the plant miRNAs identified from microbiome have an insignificant abundance compared to those from humans , while plant miRNA profiles in human samples were significantly different from those in plants , suggesting that sample contamination is an unlikely reason for all the plant miRNAs detected in human samples. This study also provides a set of testable synthetic miRNAs with isotopes that can be detected in situ after being fed to animals.
