  The aim of the study was to determine the impact of an interdisciplinary exercise-based rehabilitation intervention on fatigue<symptom> and quality of life ( QOL) in patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs). At the Danish Knowledge Centre for Rehabilitation and Palliative Care , a 5-day interdisciplinary exercise-based rehabilitation intervention was carried out on 48 patients with MPN. It was followed by 12 weeks of self-exercising prior to follow-up. Initially and at follow-up , participants filled out validated questionnaires; Brief Fatigue<symptom> Inventory , Multidimensional Fatigue<symptom> Inventory , European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life questionnaire , Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form and Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale. Maximal oxygen uptake and muscular strength were tested as well. Paired t test was used to compare scores between baseline and follow-up. In total , 45 participants ( 94 %) completed the follow-up. No significant differences were observed on fatigue<symptom> or QOL when comparing baseline and follow-up. Mean maximal oxygen uptake increased from 27.2 to 33.6 ml O
