  Great gains were achieved with the introduction of the United Nations ' Millennium Development Goals , including improved child survival. Transition to the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs) focused on surviving , thriving , and transforming , representing an important shift to a broader public health goal , the achievement of which holds the promise of longer-term individual and societal benefits. A similar shift is needed with respect to outcomes for infants born to women living with HIV<pathogen> ( WLHIV). Programming to prevent vertical HIV<pathogen> transmission has been successful in increasingly achieving a goal of HIV-free survival for infants born to WLHIV. Unfortunately , HIV-exposed uninfected ( HEU) children are not achieving comparable health and developmental outcomes compared with children born to HIV-uninfected women under similar socioeconomic circumstances. The 3rd HEU Child Workshop , held as a satellite session of the International AIDS Society 's 9th IAS Conference in Paris in July 2017 , provided a venue to discuss HEU child health and development disparities. A summary of the Workshop proceedings follows , providing current scientific findings , emphasizing the gap in systems for long-term monitoring , and highlighting the public health need to establish a strategic plan to better quantify the short and longer-term health and developmental outcomes of HEU children.
