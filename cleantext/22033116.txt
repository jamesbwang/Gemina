  Night shift work is associated with many problems such as sleep deprivation , sleepiness , decreased cognitive performance , increased human errors , and fatigue<symptom>. This study set out to measure cognitive performance , melatonin rhythms , and sleep after different consecutive night shifts ( 7 vs. 4) among control room operators ( CORs). The participants included 60 CORs with a mean age of 30.2 years ( standard deviation , 2.0) from a petrochemical complex located in Southern Iran. Cognitive performance was assessed using the n-back task and continuous performance test. To evaluate melatonin , saliva was collected and tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To assess sleep and sleepiness , the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale were used , respectively. Individuals who worked 7 consecutive night shifts had a significantly better cognitive performance and sleep quality than those who worked 4 consecutive night shifts. However , salivary melatonin profile and sleepiness trend were not affected by shift type. The main duty of CORs working night shifts at the studied industry included managing safety-critical processes through complex displays; a responsibility that demands good cognitive performance and alertness. It is suggested that an appropriate number of consecutive night shifts in a rotating shift system should be planned with the ultimate aim of improving CROs performance/alertness and enhancing safety.
