J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Mixed martial arts ( MMA) fighters typically use rapid<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( RWL) as a strategy to make competition weight. The aim of the present study was to compare body<symptom> weight and mood changes in professional male MMA athletes who used strategies to rapidly lose weight ( n = 9) and with MMA athletes who did not ( n = 3). Body mass and mood states of anger , confusion<symptom> , depression<symptom> , fatigue<symptom> , tension , and vigor and total mood disturbance were assessed ( a) 30 days before competition , ( b) at the official weigh-in 1 day before competition , ( c) 10 minutes before competition , and ( d) 10 minutes postcompetition. Results indicated that RWL associated with reporting higher confusion<symptom> and greater total mood disturbance at each assessment point. Rapid<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> also associated with high anger at the official weigh-in. However , in performance , RWL did not have deleterious effects on performance. The RWL group also reported greater total mood disturbance at all assessment points with a moderate difference effect size. Research supports the notion that RWL associates with potentially dysfunctional mood states.
