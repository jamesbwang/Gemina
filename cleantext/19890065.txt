  The goal of this study was to assess the ability of quercetin ( Qu) to protect against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Cardiac injury was assessed in the context of global ischemia of isolated hearts , coronary artery ligated rats , and H9C2 cells. Qu was shown to significantly inhibit inflammatory cytokine production in coronary artery occlusion-induced rats , isolated hearts , and H9C2 cells. Electrocardiographic analysis revealed a restoration of the ST segment to normal levels following treatment of Qu. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride ( TTC) staining and pathological analysis showed that Qu could significantly alleviate myocardial injury in vivo. Furthermore , ex vivo analyses showed improved recovery of heart function in response to Qu , characterized by enhanced myocardial contractility and coronary flow in isolated hearts. From a mechanistic standpoint , these effects appeared to be mediated through the HMGB1-related pathway , with expression of downstream targets significantly downregulated in rats , isolated hearts , and H9C2 cells following Qu treatment. Taken together , these data demonstrate the protective effects of Qu against myocardial injury via inhibition of the HMGB1 pathway in a myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury ( I/R) model.
