  Berry consumption is associated with colorectal-cancer chemoprevention , but digestive conditions can affect this property. The bioaccessibility and apparent permeability coefficients of bioactive compounds from Andean Berry Juice ( ABJ) after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation were analyzed. The antiproliferative effect of the fermented nondigestible fraction was evaluated against SW480 colon-adenocarcinoma cells. Gallic acid displayed the highest bioaccessibility in the mouth<symptom> , stomach , small intestine , and colon. However , chlorogenic acid exhibited the highest apparent permeability coefficients ( up to 1.98 Ã— 10
