  Murine leprosy<disease> , caused by Mycobacterium<disease> lepraemurium ( MLM) , is a chronic<disease> disease<disease> that closely resembles human leprosy<disease> Even though this disease does not directly involve the nervous system , we investigated a possible effect on working memory during this chronic<disease> infection<disease> in Balb/c mice. We evaluated alterations in the dorsal region of the hippocampus and measured peripheral levels of cytokines at 40 , 80 , and 120 days post-infection. To evaluate working memory , we used the T-maze while a morphometric analysis was conducted in the hippocampus regions CA1 , CA2 , CA3 , and dentate gyrus ( DG) to measure morphological changes. In addition , a neurochemical analysis was performed by HPLC. Our results show that , at 40 days post-infection , there was an increase in the bacillary load in the liver and spleen associated to increased levels of IL-4 , working memory deterioration , and changes in hippocampal morphology , including degeneration in the four subregions analyzed. Also , we found a decrease in neurotransmitter levels at the same time of infection. Although MLM does not directly infect the nervous system , these findings suggest a possible functional link between the immune system and the central nervous system.
