  Phosphorus oxide modified graphene was prepared by one-step electrochemical anodic exfoliation method and utilized as electrode in a redox supercapacitor that contained potassium iodide in electrolytes. The whole preparation process was completed in a few minutes and the yield was about 37.2 %. The prepared sample has better electrocatalysis activity for I
