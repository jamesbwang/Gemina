  Reliable reference intervals for serum progastrin-releasing peptide ( ProGRP) in healthy Chinese adults with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ( ECLIA) are still lacking in the Chinese population. The study aims to establish reference intervals for ProGRP with ECLIA in apparently healthy Chinese adults. A total of 384 apparently healthy individuals from six representative geographical regions in China were enrolled: 200 males and 184 females with a mean age of 43.4 ± 12.2 years , and an age range from 21 to 85 years. Serum ProGRP levels were analyzed on Cobas e601 automatic immunoassay analyzer with ECLIA. Reference intervals for serum ProGRP with ECLIA were determined following CLSI C28-A3 guidelines using a nonparametric method. In an apparently healthy Chinese population , the reference intervals for serum ProGRP with ECLIA were ⩽ 53.92 ng/L for adults aged 21-70 years and ⩽ 75.69 ng/L for adults aged > 70 years , respectively. The reference values for serum ProGRP with ECLIA in an apparently healthy Chinese population were established according to the CLSI C28-A3 document , providing a reference for the clinical work.
