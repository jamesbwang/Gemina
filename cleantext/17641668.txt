  While cannabis is perceived as a relatively safe drug by the public , accumulating clinical data suggest detrimental cardiovascular effects of cannabinoids. Cannabis has been legalized in several countries and jurisdictions recently. Experimental studies specifically targeting cannabinoids ' effects on the cerebral vasculature are rare. There is evidence for transient vasoconstrictive effects of cannabinoids in the peripheral and cerebral vasculature in a complex interplay of vasodilation and vasoconstriction. Vasoreactivity to cannabinoids is dependent on the specific molecules , their metabolites and dose , baseline vascular tone , and vessel characteristics as well as experimental conditions and animal species. We systematically review the currently available literature of experimental results in
