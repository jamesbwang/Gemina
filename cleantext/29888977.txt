  Pain is prevalent and affects functioning and quality of life of children with cerebral palsy ( CP). However , pain in CP is under recognized. The International Classification of Functioning , Disabiity and Health ( ICF) guides the selection of comprehensive chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> assessment tools. Our objectives were to identify measures addressing pain in children with CP , characterize the content of each measure using the ICF , and identify gaps and overlaps. Measures were identified from: ( 1) a systematic review of outcome measures ( 1998-2012) and ( 2) a scan of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> measures ( 2013-2015). Included measures were those published in English , used in children and youth with CP , and contained an item/domain addressing pain. Constructs of the measures were linked to the ICF. Overall , 31 measures addressing chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in CP were included. Considerable variability was found in the degree to which their content represented the ICF. Most of pain measures address pain intensity and pain location ( body functions) as opposed to functional impact of pain ( activities and participation). Functional dimensions are poorly represented in pain measures. Our findings may guide the selection of measures for research and clinical needs for comprehensive chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> management in children with CP. Implications for Rehabilitation Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is prevalent among children with cerebral palsy and significantly interfere with functional activities. To effectively manage chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in children with cerebral palsy , measures capturing functional-based information need to be part of routine chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> assessment.
