  To investigate the effect of miR-524 on the proliferation of thyroid cancer and its underlying mechanism. MiR-524 expression levels in thyroid cancer samples and para-cancer tissues were tested by quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR). Cells proliferative ability and apoptosis were evaluated through methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT) and apoptosis assays , respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the regulatory mechanism. MiR-524 expression was reduced in thyroid cancer specimen ( p < 0.05). Up-regulated miR-524 expression inhibited the proliferative ability and enhanced cell apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells. SPAG9 was a target gene of miR-524 , and was reversely regulated by miR-524. MiR-524 represses thyroid cancer cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis via targeting SPAG9.
