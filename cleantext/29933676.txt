  Nineteen compounds were isolated from the roots of Isatis indigotica through silica gel , Sephadex LH-20 , ODS and pre-HPLC chromatography technique. Their structures were elucidated by the MS and NMR spectra as 7-hydroxydeoxyvasicinone ( 1) , ( 1H-indol-3-yl) oxoacetamide ( 2) , 1-methoxy-1H-indole-3-acetonitrile ( 3) , arvelexin ( 4) , 1H-indole-3-acetonitrile ( 5) , 1H-indole-3-aldehyde ( 6) , 1H-indole-3-acetic acid ( 7) , 2,3-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-indole-3-acetonitrile ( 8) , deoxyvasicinone ( 9) , indigotiisocoumarin A ( 10) , cycloanthranilylproline ( 11) , quinazoline-2,4 ( 1H ,3 H)- diones ( 12) , indirubin ( 13) , ( +)- pinoresinol ( 14) , ( +)- epipinoresinol ( 15) , burselignan ( 16) , ( +)- isolariciresinol ( 17) , vanillic acid ( 18) and 5-hydroxymaltol ( 19). Among them , compound 1 is a new natural product , and compound 2 , 14 , 15 , 18 and 19 were isolated from the title plant for the first time.
