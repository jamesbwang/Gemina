  Ovarian reserve evaluation has been the focus of substantial clinical research for several years. This study aimed to examine the associations between markers of ovarian reserve and ovarian response. This prospective study included 132 infertile women aged 24-48 years undergoing routine exploration during unstimulated cycles prior to the start of assisted reproductive technology ( ART) treatments at our center from July 2015 to January 2017. Descriptive parameters and patient characteristics were reported as mean ( SD) or median ( range) values depending on the data distribution pattern. Student 's t-test was performed for continuous variables; the Wilcoxon and Pearson 's test were used for data not following a normal distribution; and Fisher 's test was used for categorical variables. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. At the time of the study , the patients had a mean age of 35.7 ± 3.84 years. On day 3 of the cycle , the mean anti-Müllerian hormone ( AMH) serum level was 2.84 ± 1.57 ng/mL and the patients had 14.68 ± 4.2 antral follicles ( AFC). A significant correlation was observed between AMH and age ( r = -0.34 p < .01) , follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH) serum levels ( r = -0.32 , p < .01) , AFC ( r = 0.81 , p < .00001) , total dose of medication during ovarian stimulation ( r = -0.28 , p < .0003) , and ongoing pregnancy rate ( p < .05). Age was significantly correlated with FSH ( r = 0.46 , p < .01) , AFC ( r = -0.34 , p < .00001) , total dose of medication during ovarian stimulation ( r = 0.43 , p < .0003) , and ongoing pregnancy rate ( p < .04). Serum AMH and age are independent predictors of ovarian reserve and ovarian stimulation outcome in infertile women. Age and serum AMH level may be used to advise subfertile couples of their pregnancy prospects.
