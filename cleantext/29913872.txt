  Introduction Chronic musculoskeletal pain represents a significant health problem among adults in Norway. The prevalence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> can be up to 50 % in both genders. However , the prevalence of chronic widespread pain is significantly higher in females than in males. Chronic widespread pain is seen as the end of a continuum of pain. There is rather sparse knowledge about the incidence of pain in initially pain free individuals and the course of self-reported pain over time. Moreover , little is known about risk factors for incidence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> or prognostic factors for the course of self-reported pain. We believe that such knowledge may contribute to develop strategies for treatment at an early stadium of the pain condition and thereby reduce the prevalence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> included chronic widespread pain. Aims of the study The aims of this study were threefold: ( 1) to calculate the incidence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in a female cohort , ( 2) to describe the course of pain and ( 3) to investigate whether or not health complaints and sleep problems are predictive factors for onset of pain or prognostic factors for the course of pain. Methods This is a prospective population-based study of all women between 20 and 50 years who were registered in Arendal , Norway , in 1989 ( N = 2498 individuals). A questionnaire about chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ( pain > 3 months duration in muscles , joints , back or the whole body) , modulating factors for pain , sleep problems and seven non-specific health complaints was mailed to all traceable women , in 1990 ( N = 2498) , 1995 ( n = 2435) and 2007 ( n = 2261). Of these , 1338 responded on all three occasions. Outcome measures were presence and extent of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Results The prevalence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> was 57 % in 1990 and 61 % in 2007. From 1990 to 2007 , 53 % of the subjects changed pain category. The incidence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in initially pain free individuals during follow-up was 44 % , whereas the recovery rate was 25 %. Impaired sleep quality predicted onset of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. There was a linear association between the number of health complaints and the incidence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in initially pain free individuals. Equivalent results were found for persistence of pain and worsening of pain. Conclusion The prevalence of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> was rather stable throughout the follow-up period , but the prevalence of chronic widespread pain increased. Individual changes in pain extent occurred frequently. The presence of sleep disturbances and number of health complaints predicted onset , persistence and worsening of pain. Implications Sleep problems must be thoroughly addressed as a possible risk factor for onset or worsening of pain. Elimination of sleep problems in an early phase is an interesting approach in treating chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. More research is needed to illuminate the possible pathogenetic relations between pain , non-specific health complaints , sleep problems and also
