  Iron is essential for many cellular processes , but can generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals in the presence of oxygen. Therefore , intracellular iron accumulation must be tightly regulated , by balancing uptake with storage or export. Iron uptake in Leishmania is mediated by the coordinated action of two plasma membrane proteins , the ferric iron reductase LFR1 and the ferrous iron transporter LIT1. However , how these parasites regulate their cytosolic iron concentration to prevent toxicity remains unknown. Here we characterize Leishmania<pathogen> Iron Regulator 1 ( LIR1) , an iron responsive protein with similarity to membrane transporters of the major facilitator superfamily ( MFS) and plant nodulin-like proteins. LIR1 localizes on the plasma membrane of L. amazonensis promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. After heterologous expression in Arabidopsis thaliana , LIR1 decreases the iron content of leaves and worsens the chlorotic phenotype of plants lacking the iron importer IRT1. Consistent with a role in iron efflux , LIR1 deficiency does not affect iron uptake by L. amazonensis but significantly increases the amount of iron retained intracellularly in the parasites. LIR1 null parasites are more sensitive to iron toxicity and have drastically impaired infectivity , phenotypes that are reversed by LIR1 complementation. We conclude that LIR1 functions as a plasma membrane iron exporter with a critical role in maintaining iron homeostasis and promoting infectivity in L. amazonensis.
