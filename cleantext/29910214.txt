  Here , we describe a simplified procedure for embryo production in the Japanese black cow that uses a single caudal epidural injection of follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH). First , we compared the efficiency of superovulation for in vivo embryo production between conventional multiple FSH treatment ( control , n = 10) and single epidural administration ( epidural , n = 5). The number of transferable blastocysts was similar between control and epidural groups ( 4.7 ± 3.5 and 9.0 ± 6.0 , respectively). Next , we compared in vitro embryo production by ovum pick-up and in vitro fertilization ( OPU-IVF) between control ( n = 12) and epidural groups ( n = 12). The rate of development to transferable blastocysts was higher in the epidural group than in the control ( 23.3 vs. 10.5 % , P < 0.001). In conclusion , a single epidural administration of FSH can induce follicular development comparable to that of the conventional superovulation protocol and may improve the productivity of OPU-IVF.
