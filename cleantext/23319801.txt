  While screening and treatment have sharply reduced breast cancer mortality in the past 50 years , more targeted diagnostic testing may improve the accuracy and efficiency of care. Our retrospective , age-matched , case-control study evaluated the differential value of mammography and genetic variants to predict breast cancer depending on patient age. We developed predictive models using logistic regression with group lasso comparing ( 1) diagnostic mammography findings , ( 2) selected genetic variants , and ( 3) a combination of both. For women older than 60 , mammography features were most predictive of breast cancer risk ( imaging AUC = 0.74 , genetic variants AUC = 0.54 , combined AUC = 0.71). For women younger than 60 there is additional benefit to obtaining genetic testing ( imaging AUC = 0.69 , genetic variants AUC = 0.70 , combined AUC = 0.72). In summary , genetic testing supplements mammography in younger women while mammography appears sufficient in older women for breast cancer risk prediction.
