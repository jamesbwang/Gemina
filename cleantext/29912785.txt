  This cross-sectional study assessed international rehabilitation practitioners ' views of mental health assessment ( MHA) , related specifically to assessment tools and needs in the field. We delivered an anonymous web-based survey capturing rehabilitation practioners ' perspectives on MHA practices , assessment tools , and needs through the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine in the USA and through national rehabilitation networks in Finland and Norway. Altogether , 355 rehabilitation professionals answered the survey. Unmet MHA needs , most often attributed to insufficient time ( 112/269 responders) , were recognized among rehabilitation professionals irrespective of the country of practice. When professional experience was weighed against barriers to conducting MHA , cost was statistically significantly linked to professional experience , with those with less experience viewing cost more as a barrier ( P = 0.019). Rehabilitation professionals from different professions , in different countries , and working with a variety of clinical populations recognize defined barriers to MHA in rehabilitation.
