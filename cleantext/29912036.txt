  Some individuals show little or no increase in maximal oxygen consumption ( VË™O2max) in response to training programs consistent with public health guidelines. However , results from studies using more intense programs challenge the concept that some humans have limited trainability. We explore the implications of these divergent observations on the biology of trainability and propose a new set of twin studies to explore them.
