  Invertases are used for several purposes; one among these is the production of fructooligosaccharides. The aim of this study was to biochemically characterize invertase from industrial Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> CAT-1 and Rhodotorula<pathogen> mucilaginosa<pathogen> isolated from Cerrado soil. The optimum pH and temperature were 4.0 and 70 °C for Rhodotorula<pathogen> mucilaginosa<pathogen> invertase and 4.5 and 50 °C for Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> invertase. The pH and thermal stability from 3.0 to 10.5 and 75 °C for R.<pathogen> mucilaginosa<pathogen> invertase , respectively. The pH and thermal stability for S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> CAT-1 invertase from 3.0 to 7.0 , and 50 °C , respectively. Both enzymes showed good catalytic activity with 10 % of ethanol in reaction mixture. The hydrolysis by invertases occurs predominantly when sucrose concentrations are ≤ 5 %. On the other hand , the increase in the concentration of sucrose to levels above 10 % results in the highest transferase activity , reaching about 13.3 g/L of nystose by S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> invertase and 12.6 g/L by R.<pathogen> mucilaginosa<pathogen> invertase. The results demonstrate the high structural stability of the enzyme produced by R.<pathogen> mucilaginosa<pathogen> , which is an extremely interesting feature that would enable the application of this enzyme in industrial processes.
