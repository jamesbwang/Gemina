  A common cavity deformity ( CCD) is a deformed inner ear in which the cochlea and vestibule are confluent forming a common rudimentary cystic cavity that results in profound hearing loss. There are few studies paying attention to common cavity. Our group is engrossed in observing the improvement of auditory and verbal abilities in children who have received cochlear implantation ( CI) , and comparing these targets between children with common cavity and normal inner ear structure. A retrospective study was conducted in 12 patients with profound hearing loss that were divided into a common cavity group and a control group , six in each group matched in sex , age and time of implantation , based on inner ear structure. Categories of Auditory Performance ( CAP) and speech intelligibility rating ( SIR) scores and aided hearing thresholds were collected and compared between the two groups. All patients wore CI for more than 1 year at the Cochlear Center of Anhui Medical University from 2011 to 2015. Postoperative CAP and SIR scores were higher than before operation in both groups ( p < 0.05) , although the scores were lower in the CCD group than in the control group ( p < 0.05). The aided threshold was also lower in the control group than in the CCD group ( p < 0.05). Even though audiological improvement in children with CCD was not as good as in those without CCD , CI provides benefits in auditory perception and communication skills in these children.
