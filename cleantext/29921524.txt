  Sideways falls impose high stress on the thin superolateral cortical bone of the femoral neck , the region regarded as a fracture-prone region of the hip. Exercise training is a natural mode of mechanical loading to make bone more robust. Exercise-induced adaptation of cortical bone along the femoral neck has been previously demonstrated. However , it is unknown whether this adaption modulates hip fracture behavior. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of specific exercise loading history on fall-induced hip fracture behavior by estimating fracture load and location with proximal femur finite element ( FE) models created from magnetic resonance images ( MRI) of 111 women with distinct exercise histories: 91 athletes ( aged 24.7 ± 6.1 years , > 8 years competitive career) and 20 women as controls ( aged 23.7 ± 3.8 years). The athletes were divided into five groups based on typical loading patterns of their sports: high-impact ( H-I: 9 triple-jumpers and 10 high jumpers) , odd-impact ( O-I: 9 soccer and 10 squash players) , high-magnitude ( H-M: 17 power-lifters) , repetitive-impact ( R-I: 18 endurance runners) , and repetitive non-impact ( R-NI: 18 swimmers). Compared to the controls , the H-I , O-I , and R-I groups had significantly higher ( 11-26 % , p < 0.05) fracture loads. Also , the fracture location in the H-I and O-I groups was significantly more proximal ( 7-10 %) compared to the controls. These results suggest that an exercise loading history of high impacts , impacts from unusual directions , or repetitive impacts increases the fracture load and may lower the risk of fall-induced hip fracture.
