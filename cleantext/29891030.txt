  Innovation in medicine is often driven by the observations of imaginative physicians who are blessed with insatiable curiosity , coupled with the inability to accept technical boundaries , the status quo of patient care , or the acceptance of procedural morbidity. Few examples illustrate this truism better than the physician-originated clinical research that transformed the safety of carotid stent angioplasty over the last 2 decades. Initial clinical application of carotid stenting suggested that proximal protection may be a better approach to prevent embolic stroke during the angioplasty procedure. The history of how this innovation was developed is particularly relevant as vascular surgeons adopt new endovascular therapies. It has been more than 15 years since Dr Juan Parodi put together a multidisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians to test the `` proximal protection '' hypothesis. The goal of this overview was to provide Dr Parodi team 's perspective on the development of the proximal protection and flow reversal concept to minimize plaque embolization during carotid stent angioplasty procedures.
