  Inhibition of more than one pathway in a cancer cell with a single molecule could result in better therapies with less complex dosing regimens. In this work multi-component ligands have been prepared by joining together key pharmacophores of two different enzyme inhibitors in a way which increases potency against the individual pathways. Selective JAK1/2 inhibitor , ruxolitinib ( 3) , and pan-HDAC inhibitor vorinostat ( 4) were linked together by a single nitrogen atom to create a new series of compounds with very potent JAK2 and HDAC6 inhibition with selectivity against HDAC1. A preferred compound , 13b , had unprecedented sub-nanomolar JAK2 potency with an IC
