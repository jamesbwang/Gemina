  Vitamin D deficiency affects > 60 % of the Korean population. Recent reports in Caucasian , African American , and Chinese populations indicate an association between vitamin D status and related single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) , but specific associations differ among study populations. We investigated the relationship between five SNPs involved in the vitamin D metabolic pathway ( DHCR7 rs12785878 , GC rs2282679 , CYP2R1 rs12794714 , CYP2R1 rs10741657 , and CYP24A1 rs6013897) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D status in Koreans using the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , a nationwide database. Whether the association was modified by demographic and lifestyle factors , including sex , body mass index ( BMI) , smoking status , drinking status , physical activity , and sun exposure , were also investigated. The results showed the serum level of 25 ( OH) D was associated with rs12785878 , rs2282679 , and rs12794714 genotypes , but not with rs10741657 or rs6013897. The genetic risk score ( GRS) calculated by summing the number of alleles of these 5 SNPs was associated with low circulating levels of 25 ( OH) D. However , the negative association between 25 ( OH) D and GRS was modified by obesity and sun exposure. Specifically , negative associations between 25 ( OH) D and GRS were present in adults with lower BMI ( < 25 kg/m
