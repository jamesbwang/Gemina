  Isohydry ( maintenance of plant water potential at the cost of carbon gain) and anisohydry ( gas exchange maintenance at the cost of declining plant water status) make up two ends of a stomatal drought response strategy continuum. However , few studies have merged measures of stomatal regulation with xylem hydraulic safety strategies based on in situ field measurements. The goal of this study was to characterize the stomatal and xylem hydraulic safety strategies of woody species in the biodiverse Mediterranean-type ecosystem region of California. Measurements were conducted in situ when California was experiencing the most severe drought conditions in the past 1200 years. We found coordination among stomatal , hydraulic , and standard leaf functional traits. For example , stem xylem vulnerability to cavitation ( P
