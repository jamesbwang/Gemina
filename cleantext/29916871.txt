  To compare the quality of surgical resection of transanal total mesorectal excision ( TA-TME) and robotic total mesorectal excision ( R-TME). Both TA-TME and R-TME have been advocated to improve the quality of surgery for rectal cancer below 10 cm from the anal verge , but there are little data comparing TA-TME and R-TME. Data of patients undergoing TA-TME or R-TME for rectal cancer below 10 cm from the anal verge and a sphincter-saving procedure from 5 high-volume rectal cancer referral centers between 2011 and 2017 were obtained. Coarsened exact matching was used to create balanced cohorts of TA-TME and R-TME. The main outcome was the incidence of poor-quality surgical resection , defined as a composite measure including incomplete quality of TME , or positive circumferential resection margin ( CRM) or distal resection margin ( DRM). Out of a total of 730 patients ( 277 TA-TME , 453 R-TME) , matched groups of 226 TA-TME and 370 R-TME patients were created. These groups were well-balanced. The mean tumor height from the anal verge was 5.6 cm ( SD 2.5) , and 70 % received preoperative radiotherapy. The incidence of poor-quality resection was similar in both groups ( TA-TME 6.9 % vs R-TME 6.8 %; P = 0.954). There were no differences in TME specimen quality ( complete or near-complete TA-TME 99.1 % vs R-TME 99.2 %; P = 0.923) and CRM ( 5.6 % vs 6.0 %; P = 0.839). DRM involvement may be higher after TA-TME ( 1.8 % vs 0.3 %; P = 0.051). High-quality TME for patients with rectal adenocarcinoma of the mid and low rectum can be equally achieved by transanal or robotic approaches in skilled hands , but attention should be paid to the distal margin.
