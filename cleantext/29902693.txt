  Amphotericin B ( AMB) is a polyene macrolide antibiotic used for treating invasive fungal infections. Liposomal AMB ( L-AMB) is a lipid dosage form which reduces the side effects and toxicity of the drug. The quantitation of free AMB ( F-AMB) and L-AMB in vivo is important to monitor quality control of the liposomal formulation and to ensure its safety during clinical use. In this study , an original strategy was developed to separately determine F-AMB and L-AMB in rat plasma using LC-MS/MS. F-AMB was analyzed after separation by solid phase extraction , total AMB ( T-AMB) was determined after protein precipitation and L-AMB was determined by difference. The method was fully validated. Calibration curves were linear in the ranges 0.7-120 μg/mL for T-AMB and 0.2-20 μg/mL for F-AMB. Accuracy and precision results were within acceptable variability limits , recoveries were consistent and reproducible , matrix effects were insignificant and analytes were stable under all the storage conditions tested. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats administered a single intravenous 6 mg/kg dose of L-AMB. The method will allow further clinical studies of L-AMB and provide useful technical support for the assay of other liposomal drug formulations.
