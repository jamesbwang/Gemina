  Interleukin-5 ( IL-5) is best known as key regulator in eosinophil-associated diseases such as asthma. While a connection to vascular changes in eosinophil-associated lung diseases is still elusive , recent evidence suggests that IL-5 may have an atheroprotective role. Here , we report an unexpected anti-angiogenic potential of IL-5 on vascular endothelial cells in vitro. IL-5 significantly inhibited fundamental functions of human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( HMVEC-L) in vessel formation including VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation , migration and tube formation. Knockdown ( KD) of STAT5 abolished the direct anti-angiogenic effect of IL-5 on VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation , migration and tube formation.
