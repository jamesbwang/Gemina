  Nowadays , in many countries , stress is becoming a problem that increasingly affects the health of people. Suffering stress continuously can lead to serious behavioral disorders such as anxiety<symptom> or depression<symptom> Every person , in his daily routine , can face many factors which can contribute to increase his stress level. This paper describes a flexible and distributed model to monitor environmental variables associated with stress , which provides adaptability to any environment in an agile way. This model was designed to transform stress environmental variables in value added information ( key stress indicator) and to provide it to external systems , in both proactive and reactive mode. Thus , this value-added information will assist organizations and users in a personalized way helping in the detection and prevention of acute stress cases. Our proposed model is supported by an architecture that achieves the features above mentioned , in addition to interoperability , robustness , scalability , autonomy , efficient , low cost and consumption , and information availability in real time. Finally , a prototype of the system was implemented , allowing the validation of the proposal in different environments at the University of Alicante.
