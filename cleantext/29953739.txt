  To explore the associations between microvascular abnormalities assessed by nailfold capillaroscopy ( NFC) and pulmonary and cardiac involvement in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis ( DM) assessed after medium- to long-term follow-up. Fifty-eight juvenile DM patients were examined mean 17.0 ( SD 10.6) years after symptom onset. Nailfold capillary density ( NCD) and neovascular pattern ( defined as scleroderma active or late pattern) were analysed blinded to clinical data. Pulmonary involvement was assessed by pulmonary function tests ( PFT) including spirometry , diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide ( DLCO) and body plethysmography; also high-resolution computed tomography ( HRCT) was performed. Cardiac involvement was assessed by electrocardiography , Holter monitoring ( heart rate variability) and echocardiography. Patients with low NCD ( < 6 capillaries/mm) ( n = 21) , compared to patients with normal NCD ( â‰¥ 6 capillaries/mm) ( n = 37) , presented lower forced vital capacity ( 89.7 vs 98.5 % of predicted) , total lung capacity ( 87.8 vs 94.5 % of predicted) and more often low DLCO ( 15/21 ( 71 %) vs 14/37 ( 38 %)); all p 's < 0.05. HRCT assessed airways disease was more frequent in the low NCD group ( 6/21 ( 30 %) vs 3/37 ( 8 %); p = 0.034). No associations were found between i) NCD and cardiac parameters or ii) neovascular pattern and pulmonary or cardiac parameters. In juvenile DM patients , low NCD was associated with lung involvement , which was mostly subclinical. No significant associations with cardiac involvement were found. These results shed light on possible mechanisms underlying organ involvement , but further and preferably larger studies are needed to identify NCD as a potential biomarker for lung and cardiac involvement in juvenile DM.
