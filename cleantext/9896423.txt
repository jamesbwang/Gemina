  We propose an effective scheme to implement fast and robust population transfer with a Josephson qutrit via shortcut to adiabaticity. Facilitated by the level-transition rule , a Î›-configuration resonant interaction can be realized between microwave drivings and the qutrit with sufficient level anharmonicity , from which we perform the reversible population transfers via invariant-based shortcut. Compared with the detuned drivings , the utilized resonant drivings shorten the transfer times significantly. Further analysis of the dependence of transfer time on Rabi couplings is helpful to experimental investigations. Thanks to the accelerated process , transfer operation is highly insensitive to noise effects. Thus the protocol could provide a promising avenue to experimentally perform fast and robust quantum operations on Josephson artificial atoms.
