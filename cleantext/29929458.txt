  Ribonucleases of T2 family are ubiquitous cellular components which have played several biological functions in molecular and pharmaceutical fields. Therefore , a soluble and highly active RNase belonging to T2 family was screened from Bacillus<pathogen> megaterium<pathogen> NRRL 3712. Various cultivation strategies were applied to enhance the production of RNase and bacterial cell density. A monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 45 kDa , was purified to homogeneity using acetone precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. Enzyme was optimally activity at 45 °C and pH 7.0 , and it displayed a half-life of 26 min at 64 °C. It was quite stable up to 60 min at 40-50 °C temperature and over a broad range of pH 4.5-8.0. It showed great substrate specificity with yeast RNA , poly ( A) , poly ( G) , poly ( C) , and poly ( U). Kinetic parameters such as Km , Vmax , kcat and kcat Km-1 values against yeast RNA as substrate , were 71.67 mg mL-1 , 7866.4 µmol mg-1min-1 , 17669.4 sec-1 , and 246.53 , respectively. RNase exhibited great resistance against various organic solvents , detergents and metal ions , whereas its activity was stimulated up to 142 % by adding 5 mM EDTA. Hence , dictates its applicability as therapeutic agent and in various other biotechnological fields.
