  To examine the clinical utility of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-3 ( SCAT3) in university athletes with concussion in the absence and presence of baseline data over time. Athletes with concussion ( n = 23) and uninjured controls ( n = 22) were prospectively evaluated at three time-points ( baseline , 3-5 days , 3 weeks post-injury) with the SCAT3 components: ( 1) Post-Concussion Symptom Scale ( PCSS); ( 2) Standardized Assessment of Concussion ( SAC); and ( 3) modified Balance<symptom> Error Scoring System ( m-BESS). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using reliable change indices and normative data from 458 athletes who completed baseline testing. The PCSS total symptom score yielded highest sensitivity ( 47.4-72.2 %) and specificity ( 78.6-91.7 %) 3-5 days post-injury , with the SAC and m-BESS demonstrating little discriminative ability when used more than 3 days post-concussion. The utility of the SCAT3 was comparable when baseline or normative data was used for predicting concussion. The SCAT is a clinically useful tool for assessing concussion in the absence or presence of baseline data within the first 3-5 days post-injury. Clinical utility of the SCAT3 was driven by symptoms , which remains consistent in the SCAT5. Future research should explore whether additional cognitive elements in the SCAT5 improve utility beyond this timeframe.
