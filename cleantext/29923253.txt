  We compared transplant outcomes between donor types and stem cell sources for childhood acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). The medical records of children with AML in the Yeungnam region of Korea from January 2000 to June 2017 were reviewed. In all , 76 children with AML ( male-to-female ratio = 46:30) received allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT). In total , 29 patients received HSCT from either a matched-related donor or a mismatched-related donor , 32 patients received an unrelated donor , and 15 patients received umbilical cord blood. In term of stem cell sources , bone<disease> marrow was used in 15 patients and peripheral blood in 46 patients. For all HSCT cases , the 5-year overall survival ( OS) was 73.1 % ( 95 % CI: 62.7-83.5) and the 5-year event-free survival ( EFS) was 66.1 % ( 95 % CI: 54.5-77.7). There was no statistical difference in 5-year OS according to the donor types or stem cell sources ( P = .869 and P = .911). There was no statistical difference in 5-year EFS between donor types or stem cell sources ( P = .526 and P = .478). For all HSCT cases , the 5-year relapse rate was 16.1 % ( 95 % CI: 7.3-24.9) and the 5-year non-relapse mortality ( NRM) was 13.3 % ( 95 % CI: 5.1-21.5). There was no statistical difference in the 5-year relapse rate according to the donor types or stem cell sources ( P = .971 and P = .965). There was no statistical difference in the 5-year NRM between donor types or stem cell sources ( P = .461 and P = .470).
