  In recent years , simulations based on phantom models have become increasingly popular in the medical field. In the field of functional and stereotactic neurosurgery , a cranial phantom would be useful to train operative techniques , such as stereo-electroencephalography ( SEEG) , to establish new methods as well as to develop and modify radiological techniques. In this study , we describe the construction of a cranial phantom and show examples for it in stereotactic and functional neurosurgery and its applicability with different radiological modalities. We prepared a plaster skull filled with agar. A complete operation for deep brain stimulation ( DBS) was simulated using directional leads. Moreover , a complete SEEG operation including planning , implantation of the electrodes , and intraoperative and postoperative imaging was simulated. An optimally customized cranial phantom is filled with 10 % agar. At 7 Â°C , it can be stored for approximately 4 months. A DBS and an SEEG procedure could be realistically simulated. Lead artifacts can be studied in CT , X-ray , rotational fluoroscopy , and MRI. This cranial phantom is a simple and effective model to simulate functional and stereotactic neurosurgical operations. This might be useful for teaching and training of neurosurgeons , establishing operations in a new center and for optimization of radiological examinations.
