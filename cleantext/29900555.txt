  Human T-cell<disease> leukemia<disease> virus type I ( HTLV-1) infection is endemic in Japan , particularly clustered in the southwestern district , Kyushu-Okinawa , which consists of eight prefectures that further consist of 274 municipalities. However , no information is available about the fine-scale distribution of HTLV-1 infection within Kyushu-Okinawa. To assess the municipal-level distribution of people with HTLV-1 infection in Kyushu-Okinawa , we performed a cross-sectional study using a fine-scale geographic information system map based on HTLV-1 screening test results from the Japanese Red Cross database from September 2012 to February 2014. Of the 881 871 ( 646 914 male , 234 957 female) screened blood donors , 981 were seropositive for HTLV-1 by confirmatory test. The seroprevalence was 0.11 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.10 % -0.12 %) for all , 0.094 % ( 95 % CI , 0.09 % -0.10 %) for male , and 0.16 % ( 95 % CI , 0.14 % -0.18 %) for female individuals. The sex- and age-specific HTLV-1 seroprevalence varied significantly across municipalities; particularly , the seroprevalence among women aged 50 years was significantly higher than that of men in both the mainland of Kyushu-Okinawa and the satellite island<disease> , in all of which the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 was more than 1.2 %. These results show that , even in the Kyushu-Okinawa district , there are endemic clusters of HTLV-1 in small areas. This suggests that public health education programs are needed to eliminate new HTLV-1 infection in these areas.
