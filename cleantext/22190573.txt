  In the early phases of multiple sclerosis ( MS) , patients exhibit slight neuropsychiatric deficits that can only be detected using reliable tools. The present investigation aimed to examine neuropsychological performance in 35 patients with incipient MS. For the MS group , the inclusion criteria included time of disease < 3 years and low disability. The neuropsychological battery consisted of Rey Auditory Learning Test , Controlled Oral Word Association Test , Hooper Visual Organization Test , and Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( SDMT). After correction for the educational level , no significant effect of MS on performance was found for all the tests except for the number of errors of the SDMT ( NE-SDMT). Higher levels of education were associated with better performances in all tests , except for the NE-SDMT. MS patients made more errors than the controls. The effect on the NE-SDMT may reflect difficulties in the ability to inhibit inadequate responses. Patients may exhibit impulsive control disorders in incipient MS , independent of their educational level.
