  Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced pan-negative non-squamous ( non-Sq) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). However , it is unknown which chemotherapy regimen confers the greatest benefit in such patients. This study explored which chemotherapy regimens were advantageous in non-Sq NSCLC patients. A retrospective study was conducted on 114 patients with advanced non-Sq NSCLC using platinum-based chemotherapy in a first-line setting between January 2013 and December 2015. The study evaluated the most common first-line regimens including pemetrexed/platinum ( PP) , paclitaxel/carboplatin , gemcitabine/platinum , and vinorelbine/cisplatin. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS) , and secondary endpoints were the objective response rate and disease control rate ( DCR). Univariate and multivariate logistic analysis was carried out. Sixty of the 114 patients were administered PP regimens and 54 non-pemetrexed plus platinum ( NPP) regimens. The median PFS was significantly longer in the PP than in the NPP group ( 7.2 months , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 5.3-9.1 vs. 4.9 months , 95 % CI 3.2-6.6; P = 0.031). The DCR of the PP regimen was better than that of the NPP regimen ( 90.0 % vs. 74.1 %; P = 0.026). Smoking status was an independent predictor of PFS ( hazard ratio 2.1 , 95 % CI 1.4-3.3; P = 0.001) in a final multivariate Cox regression model. A PP regimen tends to be more beneficial than an NPP regimen for patients with pan-negative advanced non-Sq NSCLC. Smoking status may be a valuable predictor for the selection of a chemotherapy regimen in such patients.
