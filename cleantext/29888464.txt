  To estimate and investigate the global lifetime prevalence and correlates of skin bleaching. A meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis was performed based on a systematic and comprehensive literature search conducted in Google Scholar , ISI Web of Science , ProQuest , PsycNET , PubMed , and other relevant websites and reference lists. A total of 68 studies ( 67,665 participants) providing original data on the lifetime prevalence of skin bleaching were included. Publication bias was corrected using the trim and fill procedure. The pooled ( imputed) lifetime prevalence of skin bleaching was 27.7 % ( 95 % CI: 19.6-37.5 , I Despite some limitations , our results indicate that the practice of skin bleaching is a serious global public health issue that should be addressed through appropriate public health interventions.
