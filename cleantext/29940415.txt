  Filoviruses , including ebolaviruses and marburgviruses , are the causative agents of highly lethal disease outbreaks. The 2013-2016 Ebola<disease> virus outbreak was responsible for > 28000 infections and > 11000 deaths. Although there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for any filovirus-induced disease , monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) are among the most promising options for therapeutic development. Hundreds of mAbs have been isolated from human survivors of filovirus infections that target the viral spike glycoprotein ( GP). The binding , neutralization , and cross-reactivity of many of these mAbs has been determined. Several mAbs have been characterized structurally , and this information has been crucial for strategizing therapeutic and vaccine design. Here we present an overview of the structural features of the neutralizing/protective epitopes on filovirus glycoproteins.
