  This study aimed to study the osteo-preservative effects of captopril , an inhibitor on angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) , on bone mass , micro-architecture and histomorphology as well as the modulation of captopril on skeletal renin-angiotensin system ( RAS) and regulators for bone metabolism in mice with bilateral orchidectomy. The orchidectomized ( ORX) mice were orally administered with vehicle or captopril at low dose ( 10 mg/kg) and high dose ( 50 mg/kg) for six weeks. The distal femoral end , the proximal tibial head and the lumbar vertebra ( LV) were stained by hematoxylin and eosin , Safranin O/Fast Green and masson-trichrome. Micro-computed tomography was performed to measure bone mineral density ( BMD). Treatment with captopril increased trabecular bone area at distal metaphysis of femur , proximal metaphysis of tibia and LV-4 , moreover , high dose of captopril significantly elevated trabecular BMD of LV-2 and LV-5. The mRNA expressions of renin receptor , angiotensinogen , carbonic anhydrase II , matrix metalloproteinase-9 , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha were significantly decreased in tibia of ORX mice following treatment with captopril. The administration with captopril enhanced the ratio of OPG/RANKL mRNA expression , the mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-beta and the protein expression of bradykinin receptor-1. The inhibition on ACE by captopril exerts beneficial effects on trabecular bone of ORX mice. The therapeutic efficacy may be attributed to the regulation of captopril on local RAS and cytokines in bone.
