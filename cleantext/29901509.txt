  This study aimed to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) features and interobserver agreement of endometrial polyps. After institutional review board approval , our database was searched for women older than 18 years who underwent MRI pelvis and pelvic surgical intervention from 2012 to 2016. Seventy-two patients with polyps and 75 controls composed the study cohort. Two radiologists evaluated the MRIs retrospectively for polyps. Polyp characteristics and enhancement were assessed. Sensitivity and specificity of readers 1 and 2 were 59.7 % and 88.0 % , and 44.4 and 96.0 % , respectively. There was moderate agreement for presence of polyps ( κ = 0.556 , P ≤ 0001) , T2 fibrous core , and intratumoral cysts<symptom> , with slight agreement for T2 signal and enhancement. Polyp size moderately correlated with pathology ( κ = 0.465 ( P = 0.025) for reader 1 , κ = 0.562 ( P = 0.029) for reader 2). The most common enhancement was same as myometrium. Magnetic resonance imaging is moderately sensitive for detecting endometrial polyps , demonstrating features that are not sensitive but can be specific , with moderate interobserver agreement.
