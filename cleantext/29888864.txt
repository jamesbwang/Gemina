  The dermal compartment of skin is primarily composed of collagen-rich extracellular matrix ( ECM) , which is produced by dermal fibroblasts. In Young skin , fibroblasts attach to the ECM through integrins. During ageing , fragmentation of the dermal ECM limits fibroblast attachment. This reduced attachment is associated with decreased collagen production , a major cause of skin thinning and fragility , in the elderly. Fibroblast attachment promotes assembly of the cellular actin cytoskeleton , which generates mechanical forces needed for structural support. The mechanism ( s) linking reduced assembly of the actin cytoskeleton to decreased collagen production remains unclear. Here , we report that disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton results in impairment of TGF-β pathway , which controls collagen production , in dermal fibroblasts. Cytoskeleton disassembly rapidly down-regulates TGF-β type II receptor ( TβRII) levels. This down-regulation leads to reduced activation of downstream effectors Smad2/Smad3 and CCN2 , resulting in decreased collagen production. These responses are fully reversible; restoration of actin cytoskeleton assembly up-regulates TβRII , Smad2/Smad3 , CCN2 and collagen expression. Finally , actin cytoskeleton-dependent reduction of TβRII is mediated by induction of microRNA 21 , a potent inhibitor of TβRII protein expression. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism that links actin cytoskeleton assembly and collagen expression in dermal fibroblasts. This mechanism likely contributes to loss of TβRII and collagen production , which are observed in aged human skin.
