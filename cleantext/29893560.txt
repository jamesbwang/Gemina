  Biotransformation of neoruscogenin ( NR , 1 , spirosta-5,25 ( 27)- diene-1β ,3 β-diol) , the major bioactive sapogenin of Ruscus preparations , was carried out with the endophytic fungus Alternaria eureka. Fourteen new biotransformation products ( 2-15) were isolated , and their structures were elucidated by NMR and HRESIMS data analyses. A. eureka affected mainly oxygenation , oxidation , and epoxidation reactions on the B and C rings of the sapogenin to afford compounds 8-15. In addition to these , cleavage of the spiroketal system as in compounds 2-7 and subsequent transformations provided unusual metabolites. This is the first study reporting conversion of the spirostanol skeleton to cholestane-type metabolites 2-5. Additionally , the cleavage of the C-22/ C-26 oxygen bridge yielding a furostanol-type steroidal framework and subsequent formation of the epoxy bridge between C-18 and C-22 in 7 was encountered for the first time in steroid chemistry.
