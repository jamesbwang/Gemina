  Real-time deformability ( RT-DC) is a method for high-throughput mechanical and morphological phenotyping of cells in suspension. While analysis rates exceeding 1000 cells per second allow for a label-free characterization of complex biological samples , e.g. , whole blood , data evaluation has so far been limited to a few geometrical and material parameters such as cell size , deformation , and elastic Young 's modulus. But as a microscopy-based technology , RT-DC actually generates and yields multidimensional datasets that require automated and unbiased tools to obtain morphological and rheological cell information. Here , we present a statistical framework to shed light on this complex parameter space and to extract quantitative results under various experimental conditions. As model systems , we apply cell lines as well as primary cells and highlight more than 11 parameters that can be obtained from RT-DC data. These parameters are used to identify sub-populations in heterogeneous samples using Gaussian mixture models , to perform a dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis , and to quantify the statistical significance applying linear mixed models to datasets of multiple replicates.
