  CD73 is an ectoenzyme involved in the production of adenosine. It exerts immunosuppressive and protumoral roles and has emerged as a potential immuno-oncology target. CD73 expression was detected in TC in 54 % of melanoma metastases , involving < 50 % TC in the majority of the cases , with variable intensity. CD73 expression was significantly associated with a lower Breslow 's depth of the primary lesion<symptom> and was more frequent in patients having received prior non-surgical therapies. In an adjusted analysis , CD73 expression in TC ( H-score > 37.5 or intensity > 1) significantly correlated to decreased overall survival ( OS) from biopsy. Of the samples containing TIMC , 35 % presented CD73 + TIMC. Highly infiltrated tumors were more likely to contain CD73 + TIMC. CD73 expression in TIMC ( percentage â‰¥ 1 %) significantly correlated with improved OS from biopsy. Immunohistochemistry detected CD73 expression in more than half of metastatic melanomas. While CD73 expression in TC significantly correlated with decreased OS , CD73 expression in TIMC significantly associated with improved OS. These results encourage the study of anti-CD73 therapies for metastatic melanoma patients. CD73 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in metastatic melanomas from 114 patients. Immunostainings were evaluated in tumor cells ( TC) ( percentage , intensity ( 1-3) and H-score) and in tumor-infiltrating mononuclear cells ( TIMC) ( percentage).
