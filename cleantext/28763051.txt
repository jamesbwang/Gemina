  Ancestral state reconstruction is an important tool to study morphological evolution and often involves estimating transition rates among character states. However , various factors , including taxonomic scale and sampling density , may impact transition rate estimation and indirectly also the probability of the state at a given node. Here , we test the influence of rate heterogeneity using maximum likelihood methods on five binary perianth characters , optimized on a phylogenetic tree of angiosperms including 1230 species sampled from all families. We compare the states reconstructed by an equal-rate ( Mk1) and a two-rate model ( Mk2) fitted either with a single set of rates for the whole tree or as a partitioned model , allowing for different rates on five partitions of the tree. We find strong signal for rate heterogeneity among the five subdivisions for all five characters , but little overall impact of the choice of model on reconstructed ancestral states , which indicates that most of our inferred ancestral states are the same whether heterogeneity is accounted for or not.
