  This study evaluated the biopsychosocial characteristics of adults undergoing substance abuse evaluation with potential schizophrenia/psychotic disorder , or possible schizophrenia/psychosis-like symptoms , compared with those with no schizophrenia/psychosis-like symptoms. A cross-sectional , observational study examined 170,201 adults , aged 18 to 30 , who completed the Addiction Severity Index-Multimedia Version ( ASI-MV). Approximately 10 % were classified as having possible schizophrenia/psychosis-like symptoms or potential schizophrenia/psychotic disorder. These patients were more likely to exhibit moderate to extreme severity on employment , medical , legal , substance use , social , and psychiatric status than nonsymptomatic patients. The potential schizophrenia or psychotic disorder cohort was also more likely to have ever experienced physical abuse ( odds ratio ( OR) = 4.30 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 4.12-4.48) and/or sexual abuse ( OR = 4.32 , 95 % CI = 4.15-4.51) versus the no schizophrenia/psychosis-like symptoms cohort. Findings support a recommendation for routine screening for mental health issues , particularly schizophrenia/psychosis-like symptoms , for adults entering substance use disorder treatment settings. This may increase the likelihood of appropriate and earlier intervention.
