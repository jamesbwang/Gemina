  Production of triacylglycerols ( TAGs) through microbial fermentation is an emerging alternative to plant and animal-derived sources. The yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> is a preferred organism for industrial use but has natively a very poor capacity of TAG production and storage. Here , we engineered S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> for accumulation of high TAG levels through the use of structural and physiological factors that influence assembly and biogenesis of lipid droplets. First , human and fungal perilipin genes were expressed , increasing TAG content by up to 36 % when expressing the human perilipin gene PLIN3. Secondly , expression of the FIT2 homologue YFT2 resulted in a 26 % increase in TAG content. Lastly , the genes ERD1 and PMR1 were deleted in order to induce an endoplasmic reticulum stress response and stimulate lipid droplet formation , increasing TAG content by 72 % for Î”erd1. These new approaches were implemented in previously engineered strains that carry high flux of fatty acid biosynthesis and conversion of acyl-CoA into TAGs , resulting in improvements of up to 138 % over those high-producing strains without any substantial growth effects or abnormal cell morphology. We find that these approaches not only represent a significant improvement of S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> for TAG production , but also highlight the importance of lipid droplet dynamics for high lipid accumulation in yeast.
