  Partner notification services ( PNS) remain the backbone of syphilis<disease> control. The popularity of internet-based apps to meet sex partners among early syphilis<disease> ( ES) patients may hinder the success of PNS if partners can not be located. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between male ES patients indicating sex with men ( MSM) and reported in North Carolina between 2013 and 2016 by reported use of an internet-based app to meet sex partners ( app user). We used multivariable log-binomial regression to assess the association between app usage and ES exposure notification of ≥ 1 sex partner. Among 3,414 MSM ES patients , 58.6 % were app users. App users were more frequently white ( 33.2 % vs. 27.3 %; p = 0.003) , younger ( median: 28 vs. 30 years; p = 0.0002) and less frequently HIV co-infected ( 54.1 % vs. 58.2 %; p = 0.02) compared to non-app users. Overall , 94.9 % of app users and 89.6 % of non-app users reported ≥ 1 sex partner. App users reported 2.5-times more locatable and 2.7-times more unlocatable sex partners than non-app users. Similar proportions of app ( 23.6 %) and non-app users ( 25.0 %) reported only unlocatable partners ( p = 0.4). App usage was not associated with ES exposure notification of ≥ 1 sex partner ( adjusted risk ratio: 0.99; 95 % confidence interval: 0.87-1.13). We observed no difference in the proportion of locatable partners or likelihood of notifying ≥ 1 sex partner of exposure among MSM ES patients , by reported use of internet-based apps to meet sex partners. PNS continues to be an important mechanism to locate and assure treatment for sex partners in this population.
