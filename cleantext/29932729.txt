  Black phosphorus ( BP) , an elemental semiconductor , has attracted tremendous interest because it exhibits a wealth of interesting electronic and optoelectronic properties in equilibrium condition. The nonequilibrium electronic structures of bulk BP under a periodic field of laser remain unexplored , but can lead to intriguing topological optoelectronic properties. Here we show that , under the irradiation of circularly polarized light ( CPL) , BP exhibits a photon-dressed Floquet-Dirac semimetal state , which can be continuously tuned by changing the direction , intensity , and frequency of the incident laser. The topological phase transition from type-I to type-II Floquet-Dirac fermions manifests a new form of type-III phase , which exists in a wide range of intensities and frequencies of the incident laser. Furthermore , topological surface states exhibit nonequilibrium electron transport in a direction locked by the helicity of CPL. Our findings not only deepen our understanding of fundamental properties of BP in relation to topology but also extend optoelectronic device applications of BP to the nonequilibrium regime.
