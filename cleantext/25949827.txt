  Plasma untargeted metabolomics is a common method for evaluation of the mechanisms underlying human pathologies and identification of novel biomarkers. The plasma proteins provide the environment for transport of hydrophobic metabolites. The current sample preparation protocol relies on the immediate precipitation of proteins and thus leads to co-precipitation of a significant fraction of hydrophobic metabolites. Here we present a new simple procedure that overcomes the co-precipitation problem and improves metabolome coverage. Introducing an additional step preceding the protein precipitation , namely limited digestion with proteinase K , allows release of associated metabolites through the relaxation of the native proteins tertiary structure. The modified protocol allows clear detection of hydrophobic metabolites including fatty acids and phospholipids. Considering the potential involvement of the hydrophobic metabolites in human cardiovascular and cancer diseases , the method may constitute a novel approach in plasma untargeted metabolomics.
