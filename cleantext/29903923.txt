  Anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma , which has been recently defined as a distinct entity in the 2016 World Health Organization classification , may exhibit aggressive clinical behavior and relatively worse prognosis than pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. This study aimed to investigate whether there were any differences in MR imaging characteristics between these 2 tumors. This retrospective study included 9 patients with anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and 10 patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma who underwent MR imaging before an operation. DWI was performed in 17 patients ( 8 with anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma , 9 with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma); and DSC-PWI , in 9 patients ( 5 with anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma , 4 with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma). Demographics , conventional imaging characteristics ( location , size , cystic degeneration , enhancement , peritumoral edema<symptom> , and leptomeningeal contact) , minimum relative ADC ratio , and maximum relative CBV ratio were evaluated between the anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma groups. Anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma was more likely to demonstrate high-grade features than pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma , including greater maximum tumor diameter ( 4.7 ± 0.6 cm versus 3.1 ± 1.1 cm , Anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas often have more aggressive MR imaging features mimicking high-grade astrocytomas than pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas. DWI and DSC-PWI might be useful in the characterization and differentiation of anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.
