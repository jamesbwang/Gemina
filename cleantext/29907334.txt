  Over 80 % of the global burden of childhood deaths occur in Low- and Middle-Income Countries ( LMIC). Of the leading causes of death , respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> is common to the top three. Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( bCPAP) is a standard therapy considered safe and cost effective in high resource settings. Although high-quality trials from LMIC are few , pooled available trial data considered alongside studies from high-income countries suggest that bCPAP: ( i) reduces mortality; ( ii) reduces the need for mechanical ventilation; and ( iii) prevents extubation failure. Wider availability and optimal use at all levels of the health care system in LMIC are important steps to improve childhood survival. Studies aimed at effectively implementing , and sustaining safe use of bCPAP in the resource limited setting of LMIC are required.
