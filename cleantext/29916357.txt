  Classical aphasia<symptom> evaluation scales are too long to use in the context of acute stroke or as a monitoring tool. The Aphasia<symptom> Rapid<symptom> Test is a 26-point scale developed as a bedside assessment to rate aphasia<symptom> severity in acute stroke patients in less than 3 minutes. We aimed to adapt and validate this scale for European Portuguese. We evaluated 56 acute stroke patients in the first and in the seventh days post-stroke. In the seventh day , patients were evaluated by two independent raters , to evaluate inter-rater agreement. To study concurrent validity , the Lisbon Aphasia<symptom> Examination Battery was applied to a subset of 20 patients. The predictive ability of the Aphasia<symptom> Rapid<symptom> Test was assessed at six months , by the aphasia<symptom> subscale of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Translation to European Portuguese was based in the French and English versions , considering the words ' utilization frequency. The Chronbach 's alpha was 0.796. The concordance coefficient between the two raters was excellent ( 0.985). Correlation between Aphasia<symptom> Rapid<symptom> Test and the Lisbon Aphasia<symptom> Examination Battery was strong ( r = -0.958 , p < 0.001). The study through Bland-Altman graphs corroborated the good inter-rater agreement and concurrent validity of the test. The Aphasia<symptom> Rapid<symptom> Test score in the first day is an independent predictor of long-term outcome. This study provides reliable results for European Portuguese , with adequate internal consistency , inter-rater agreement and concurrent validity. The Aphasia<symptom> Rapid<symptom> Test is a good tool for the evaluation and monitoring of aphasia<symptom> in stroke patients.
