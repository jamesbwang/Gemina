  The activity of arthropods on corpses has been largely investigated , since they can produce information to reconstruct the peri-mortem events. However , the feeding/movement activity of insects around the crime scene , among the clothes and on the body , can also cause some alterations that can lead to wrong reconstruction and misinterpretations. This article summarises all the post-mortem arthropods artefacts related to the scene ( i.e. fly artefacts and floor stripes) and the body ( i.e. skin and other soft tissue alterations , bone alterations and hair alterations) that can mislead the forensic pathologist , discussing macroscopic and microscopic findings derived from forensic casework and from experimental laboratory studies , in order to provide a useful instrument to avoid misinterpretations and evaluation errors. Finally , some procedural notes for the documentation and the interpretation of findings are proposed.
