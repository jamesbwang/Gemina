  Cytosine-phosphate-guanosine ( CpG-ODN) has been described as a potent immunostimulatory agent in different species. No study reported the effect of a P-class CpG when administered systemically in healthy horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerance and the effect of an intramuscularly administered P-class CpG-ODN on hematology and on plasma cytokines ( IFN-α , IL-10 , TNF-α , IFN-γ) in 8 healthy horses. Intra-muscular CpG-ODN or placebo ( PBS) was administered twice at a 7 days-interval. Groups were inversed after 2 months of washout period. A physical examination , complete blood count ( CBC) and plasma cytokine measurements were performed from 2 days before injection up to 21 days after injection. P-class CpG-ODN injection was well tolerated with minor side effects. After the first injection a significant transient drop in circulating total leukocytes , lymphocytes and an increase in monocytes were observed. A transient drop in eosinophils was also noted after each CpG injection. P-class CpG-ODN at a dose of 5 mg did not create major side effects in 7 horses , one horse showed transient pyrexia. A redistribution of white blood cells was observed in horses receiving CpG , but no change in plasma cytokines was observed at the indicated dose , route of administration and sampling times.
