  Climate change policy confronts with many challenges and opportunities. Thus the aim of this study was to analyse the impact of gross domestic product ( hereinafter GDP) , trade , foreign direct investment ( hereinafter FDI) , energy efficiency ( hereinafter EF) and renewable energy ( hereinafter RE) consumption on greenhouse gas ( hereinafter GHG) emissions in 1990-2013 and reveal the main challenges and opportunities of climate policy for which policy makers should take the most attention under different stages of economic development. The results showed that the economic growth significantly contributed to the increase of GHG emissions and remains the main challenge in all groups of countries. Analysing the trade impact on pollution , the results revealed that the growth of export ( hereinafter EX) significantly reduced GHG emissions only in high income countries. However , the export remains a challenge in low income countries. FDI insignificantly determined the changes in GHG emissions in all groups of countries. Meanwhile , energy efficiency and share of renewable energy consumption are the main opportunities of climate change policy because they reduce the GHG emissions in all groups of countries. Thus , technological processes , the increase of energy efficiency and the shift from carbon to renewable energy sources are the main tools implementing the climate change policy in all countries despite the different stage of economic development.
