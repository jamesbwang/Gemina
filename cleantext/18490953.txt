  The strain Y1 , with a notably high production of neutral protease , was isolated from naturally fermented broad beans and subsequently identified as Aspergillus<pathogen> oryzae<pathogen> , through the analysis of its morphology characteristics and 18S rDNA sequence. Naturally fermented broad beans are the main raw material in Sichuan broad-bean sauce. The neutral protease from Aspergillus<pathogen> oryzae<pathogen> Y1 was purified using ammonium sulphate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography , which resulted in a 10.0-fold increase in the specific activity ( 2264.3 U/mg) and a recovery rate of 21 %. The estimated molecular mass of the purified protease was approximately 45 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified protease were 7.0 and 55 Â°C , respectively. The heat resistance of the purified protease was significantly higher than the commercial protease. The effect of metal ions on the activity of the purified protease approximated that of commercial neutral protease. Furthermore , the maximum hydrolysis rate ( V
