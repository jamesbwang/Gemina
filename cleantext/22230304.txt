  To evaluate audiological and vestibular functions via basic audiological evaluation , otoacoustic emissions and videonystagmography ( VNG) in vitiligo patients. 30 vitiligo patients ( 8 acrofacial and 22 mixed types) as the study group and 30 normal healthy adults as the control group were included in the study. All participants were submitted to basic audiological evaluation , transient and distortion product otoacoustic emmisions ( TEOAEs and DPOAEs) , vestibular assessment including history taking , office tests and videonystagmography ( VNG) and dermatological assessment to determine type , percent of body surface area involvement and duration of vitiligo. This study showed statistically significant difference between control and study groups in pure tone audiometry ( PTA) and otoacoustic emissions results. Fifty percent of vitiligo patients had peripheral vestibular disorders ( 10 vestibular neuritis and 5 posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo<symptom>. The results in this study showed that 50 % of vitiligo patients suffered from peripheral vestibular disorders in addition to auditory affection. Vitiligo patients require routine monitoring for auditory and vestibular functions for early identification and monitoring of changes as the disease progress.
