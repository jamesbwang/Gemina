  Many oncogenes , including chimeric oncoproteins , require insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF1R) for promoting cell transformation. The ETS variant 6 ( ETV6)- neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 ( NTRK3) ( EN) chimeric tyrosine kinase is expressed in mesenchymal , epithelial , and hematopoietic cancers and requires the IGF1R axis for transformation. However , current models of IGF1R-mediated EN activation are lacking mechanistic detail. We demonstrate here that IGF-mediated IGF1R stimulation enhances EN tyrosine phosphorylation and that blocking IGF1R activity or decreasing protein levels of the adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate 1/2 ( IRS1/2) results in rapid EN degradation. This was observed both in vitro and in vivo in fibroblast and breast epithelial cell line models and in MO91 , an EN expressing human leukemia<disease> cell line. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC)- based MS analysis identified the E3 ligase RING-finger protein 123 ( Rnf123 , more commonly known as KPC1) as an EN interactor upon IGF1R/insulin receptor ( INSR) inhibitor treatment. KPC1/Rnf123 ubiquitylated EN in vitro , and its overexpression decreased EN protein levels. In contrast , KPC1/Rnf123 knockdown rendered EN resistant to IGF1R inhibitor-mediated degradation. These results support a critical function for IGF1R in protecting EN from KPC1/Rnf123-mediated proteasomal degradation. Attempts to therapeutically target oncogenic chimeric tyrosine kinases have traditionally focused on blocking kinase activity to restrict downstream activation of essential signaling pathways. In this study , we demonstrate that IGF1R inhibition results in rapid ubiquitylation and degradation of the EN oncoprotein through a proteasome-dependent mechanism that is reversible , highlighting a potential strategy for targeting chimeric tyrosine kinases in cancer.
