  Hypokalemia is a serious and life-threatening clinical condition. We present a case of a 45-year-old male , with known hyperthyroidism presenting with profound tremor<symptom> , irritability<symptom> , quadriparesis , and labored breathing since morning , on the day of admission. Arterial blood gas analysis showed severe hypokalemia. Patient 's vital was stabilized and patient 's oxygen saturation was maintained on oxygen inhalation.

Thyroid function testing showed high free T3 ( tri-iodothyronine) and free T4 ( thyroxine) with low thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration in the serum , indicating thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Treatment with antithyroid drug carbimazole resulted in an improvement during the follow-up visit. Hypokalemia is believed to be a consequence of a massive shift due to increased sodium-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase ( Na
