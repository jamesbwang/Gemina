  To investigate whether the 2-devices-in-1-channel method is useful for selective biliary cannulation in patients with parapapillary diverticulum or intradiverticular papilla , where the papilla can not be seen from the front. Biliary cannulation using the 2-devices-in-1-channel method was performed in 28 patients who presented difficulty due to parapapillary diverticulum or intradiverticular papilla. There were 15 men and 13 women whose mean age was 68.8 ( 58 to 88) years. There were 22 patients with common bile duct stones , 5 with pancreatic cancer , and 1 with gallbladder cancer. Selective biliary cannulation was successful in all 28 patients. Common bile duct stones could be removed in all 22 patients after endoscopic sphincterotomy or endoscopic balloon dilation , and all 5 patients with pancreatic cancer as well as the patient with gallbladder cancer were successfully drained. There were no procedure-related complications. From these results , we consider the 2-devices-in-1-channel method is useful and safe to perform selective biliary cannulation when the papilla can not be seen from the front due to parapapillary diverticulum , or intradiverticular papilla.
