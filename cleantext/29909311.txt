  Iodine doped carbon quantum dots ( I-CQDs) have been synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method using citric acid and iohexol as precursors. The morphology and chemical structures of I-CQDs are investigated by TEM , XRD , XPS , and FTIR spectroscopy. The as-prepared I-CQDs exhibit excitation-dependent PL behavior with the emission quantum yield of 18 %. The presence of iodine ions in I-CQDs is confirmed by XPS spectrum , which endows the composite with CT imaging performance. Thus , they could be used as efficient probes for fluorescence/CT bimodal imaging. To realize a precise diagnosis of tumor lesions<symptom> , the surface of I-CQDs is conjugated with a targeting molecular ( cetuximab) to afford I-CQDs-C225. The MTT assay against three kinds of human cell lines verifies the low cytotoxicity of I-CQDs-C225. The targeting ability of I-CQDs-C225 are evaluated in vitro using HCC827 cells ( lung cancer cell line , over-expression of EGFR) , H23 ( lung cancer cell line , low expression of EGFR) and HLF cells ( lung normal cell line , low expression of EGFR) via a confocal laser scanning microscope. The results show that HCC827 cells exhibited strong fluorescence , indicating the cetuximab-conjugated I-CQDs could target specifically the cancer cells with over-expression of EGFR via EGFR mediated endocytosis.
