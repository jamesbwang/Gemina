  Physicians estimate the frailty in elderly patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) to aid in the decision making with respect to oral anticoagulant ( OAC) therapy. There are limited data on the safety of OAC therapy in non-severe frail elderly patients. We evaluated the risk factors of bleeding among non-severe frail octogenarians with AF taking OACs. Among 430 consecutive AF patients aged 80 years and over with non-severe frailty , we enrolled 346 patients ( 167 men , 83.7 ( 81.0-85.0) years) who were newly initiated on OACs: dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , edoxaban , or warfarin. To measure the frailty , the clinical frailty scale ( CFS) was used. Non-severe frailty was defined as a CFS score of < 7. The clinical factors were compared between the patients with and without bleeding during the OAC therapy. Out of the 346 patients enrolled , 266 ( 76.9 %) received direct OACs ( DOACs) and 80 ( 23.1 %) warfarin. Of the 266 patients receiving DOACs , there were 204 ( 76.7 %) prescribed appropriately adjusted-dose DOACs based on the approved Japanese recommendations. Of the 80 warfarin-treated patients , 52 ( 65.0 %) were prescribed appropriately adjusted-dose warfarin. During a follow-up of 32.7 ( 14.0-51.0) months , bleeding events were detected in 59 patients ( 17.1 %). Among the clinical factors , a multivariate analysis found that having a low body mass index ( BMI) ( < 18.5 kg/m In non-severe frail octogenarians with AF taking OACs , having a low BMI was the most significant factor associated with the development of bleeding.
