  Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) is the predominant type of esophageal cancer and most clinically curable patients are diagnosed with locally advanced disease. While the efficacy of preoperative treatment is relatively clear and well characterized , the effect of postoperative treatment , especially postoperative chemotherapy , remains controversial , and its role in the treatment strategy is obscure. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to include recent developments. A comprehensive search in the PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane databases was performed to identify studies published from the inception of each database to February 2018. The overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS) rates of patients treated with and without postoperative chemotherapy were analyzed and compared. Hazard ratios ( HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were used to assess the associations between postoperative chemotherapy and patient survival. Potential publication bias was assessed using Egger 's line regression test. A total of nine studies , including three randomized controlled trials and six retrospective studies , were retrieved from the databases , comprising a total of 1684 cases. The results showed that postoperative chemotherapy could improve OS ( HR 0.78 , 95 % CI 0.66-0.91; P = 0.002) and DFS ( HR 0.72 , 95 % CI 0.6-0.86; P < 0.001). The current meta-analysis supports postoperative chemotherapy as an independent favorable prognostic factor for ESCC , which could improve both OS and DFS.
