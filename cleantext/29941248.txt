  Previous studies on environmental antibiotics resistance genes ( ARGs) have focused on the pollution sources such as wastewater treatment plants , aquaculture and livestock farms , etc.. Few of them had addressed this issue in a regional scale such as river catchment. Hence , the occurrence and abundances of 23 ARGs were investigated in surface water samples collected from 38 sites which located from the river source to estuary of the Beijiang River. Among them , 11 ARGs were frequently detected in this region and 5 ARGs ( sulI , sulII , tetB , tetC , and tetW) were selected for their distribution pattern analysis. The abundances of the selected ARGs were higher in the upstream ( 8.70 Ã— 10
