  We studied the regularities of Cu stabilization in Haplic Chernozem contaminated with easily soluble ( acetates , nitrates , sulfates , chlorides) and poorly soluble ( acetates , nitrates , sulfates , chlorides) metal compounds in a five-year model experiment were studied. A low contents of Cu loosely bound compounds ( LBC) ( no > 5 % of total content) unchanging over time were revealed in the uncontaminated soil , which is indicative of the stability of soil processes. The Cu LBC content decreased over time in the soils contaminated with easily soluble compounds and increased in the soils contaminated with poorly soluble compounds. In both cases , the contents of Cu LBCs after 5 years of incubation remained higher than in the original uncontaminated soil. The effect of the attendant anions on the Cu LBC content was more apparent under the Cu application of 2000 mg kg
