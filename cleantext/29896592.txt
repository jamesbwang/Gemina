  A novel rectangular-ambulatory-plane TiO2 plate with exposed ( 001) facets was developed for the first time via a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach in the presence of HF solution. Solid evidence demonstrated that HF plays dual roles in the hydrothermal process , both as a stabilizer for the ( 001) facet growth and as an etching reagent selectively destroying the ( 001) facets.
