  To evaluate the effectiveness of internal auditing in hospital care focussed on improving patient safety. A before-and-after mixed-method evaluation study was carried out in eight departments of a university medical center in the Netherlands. Internal auditing and feedback focussed on improving patient safety. The effect of internal auditing was assessed 15 months after the audit , using linear mixed models , on the patient , professional , team and departmental levels. The measurement methods were patient record review on adverse events ( AEs) , surveys regarding patient experiences , safety culture and team climate , analysis of administrative hospital data ( standardized mortality rate , SMR) and safety walk rounds ( SWRs) to observe frontline care processes on safety. The AE rate decreased from 36.1 % to 31.3 % and the preventable AE rate from 5.5 % to 3.6 %; however , the differences before and after auditing were not statistically significant. The patient-reported experience measures regarding patient safety improved slightly over time ( P < 0.001). The SMR , patient safety culture and team climate remained unchanged after the internal audit. The SWRs showed that medication safety and information security were improved ( P < 0.05). Internal auditing was associated with improved patient experiences and observed safety on wards. No effects were found on adverse outcomes , safety culture and team climate 15 months after the internal audit.
