  Weak relationships result in feelings of belonging to a social neighborhood , as can be found in retirement communities. This article analyzes spatial arrangements and the registered rules for furnishings with respect to their potential to facilitate communitization processes and explain their modes of action as potential third places. The study took place in an American Continuing Care Retirement Community ( CCRC). The analysis combined biographical narrations with inhabitants , interview material with staff as well as field notes. The interviewed persons predominantly talked about the dining hall regarding their first steps in the community of the CCRC. The community table , situated in the dining hall , is equipped with rules to ensure participation in communitization processes. The rules are monitored by a committee of volunteers and staff members. The professionally supported processes result in feelings of belonging. Deviant behavior , e. g. refusing participation , results in an increased effort of staff to support communitization. Spatial structures create places for interaction , positively influence communitization and in their representation are reminiscent of third places in natural neighborhoods; however , due to class barriers and rules they can not be described as third places.
