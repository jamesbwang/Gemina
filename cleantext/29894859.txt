  The relation between water status and expression profiles of desiccation- related genes has been studied in the desiccation tolerant ( DT) aeroterrestrial green microalga Trebouxia gelatinosa , a common lichen photobiont. Algal colonies were desiccated in controlled conditions and during desiccation water content ( WC) and water potential ( Ψ) were measured to find the turgor loss point ( Ψ
