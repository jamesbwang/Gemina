  Effects of word length on where and for how long readers fixate within text are preserved in older age for alphabetic languages like English that use spaces to demarcate word boundaries. However , word length effects for older readers of naturally unspaced , character-based languages like Chinese are unknown. Accordingly , we examined age differences in eye movements<symptom> for short ( 2-character) and long ( 4-character) words during Chinese reading. Word length effects on eye-fixation times were greater for older than younger adults. We suggest this age difference is due to older adults ' saccades landing more rarely at optimal intraword locations , especially in longer words. ( PsycINFO Database Record
