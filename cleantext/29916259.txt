  The activity of the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR) determines homocysteine ( Hcy) levels , and polymorphisms in its gene affect the activity of the enzyme. Changes in the enzyme 's activity may lead to a higher susceptibility to develop arterial and venous thromboembolic disease. The aim was to analyze the relationship between the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of MTHFR , Hcy levels , and prothrombotic biomarkers in pulmonary embolism ( PE) and acute myocardial ischemia ( AMI). Clinical files of patients with thromboembolic diseases having complete data and whose doctor had requested an assay to determine the polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene , Hcy levels , and prothrombotic biomarkers were studied to search for the correlation between mutations of the MTHFR gene and Hcy levels in the different diseases. We included 334 files: 158 were from women and 176 from men ( 51 ( 19 SD) years). Sixty-three percent have had thrombosis , 8 % AMI , and 31 % PE. Patients with thrombosis had elevated frequency of the C677T polymorphism. The CC genotype was higher than the TT genotype ( P = .003) and CT versus the TT ( P = .009). In patients with PE , the CC genotype was higher than the TT genotype ( P = .038). Pulmonary embolism with massive and submassive events had predominant genotypes 677 TT ( P = .003) and the AA 1298 ( P = .017). Elevated Hcy levels in the presence of the T allele in the C677T gene and of the A allele in the A1298C gene are associated with AMI and massive and submassive PE.
