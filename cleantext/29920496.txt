  <br> Background: The notion that exposure to chronic stress predisposes individuals to develop Type 2 diabetes ( T2D) has gained much attention in recent decades. Long-term stress induces neuroadaptation in the amygdala and increases corticosterone levels. Corticosterone , the major stress hormone in rodents , induces insulin resistance and obesity in mice. However , little is known whether the stress-induced amygdalar neuroadaptation could promote the risk of T2D. We used an 11-week high-fat-diet ( HFD) feeding paradigm to induce insulin dysfunction in mice , followed by implementing a 10-day social defeat ( SD) stress protocol. Mice receiving SD at the beginning of the HFD feeding aggravated the HFD-induced insulin resistance and white adipose tissue expansion. HFD mice had higher levels of plasma corticosterone , which was not affected by the SD. The SD stress upregulated the expression of TrkB and synaptotagmin-IV in the amygdala of HFD mice. Bilateral lesions<symptom> of the central amygdalae before SD stress inhibited the stress-induced aggravating effect without affecting the HFD-induced elevation of plasma corticosterone. Stress aggravates HFD-induced insulin resistance and neuroadaptation in the amygdala. The HFD-induced insulin resistance is amygdala-dependent. Understanding the role of stress-induced amygdalar adaptation in the development of T2D could inform therapies aimed at reducing chronic stressors to decrease the risk for T2D. <br>.
