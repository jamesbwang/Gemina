  A high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of dextromepromazine , levomepromazine sulfoxide and 2-methoxyphenothiazine in levomepromazine samples was developed. The separation of the analytes was achieved within 10 min on a stationary phase containing cellulose tris ( 4-methylbenzoate) as chiral selector. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 % diethylamine in methanol with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The method was validated according to the International Council for Harmonization guideline Q2 ( R1). The detection limits based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 were in the range of 0.002 to 0.005 Î¼g/mL. The method proved to be precise and accurate in the concentration range of 0.025-1.0 % for levomepromazine sulfoxide and 2-methoxyphenothiazine and 0.025 % to 3.0 % for dextromepromazine relative to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL of levomepromazine , with the exception of levomepromazine sulfoxide at the 0.1 % level. The method was subsequently applied to the analysis of finished pharmaceutical products as well as of reference substances of the European Pharmacopoeia.
