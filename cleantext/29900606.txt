  Symbiosis plays a fundamental role in nature. Lichens are among the best known , globally distributed symbiotic systems whose ecology is shaped by the requirements of all symbionts forming the holobiont. The widespread lichen-forming fungal genus Stereocaulon provides a suitable model to study the ecology of microscopic green algal symbionts ( i.e. , phycobionts) within the lichen symbiosis. We analysed 282 Stereocaulon specimens , collected in diverse habitats worldwide , using the algal ITS rDNA and actin gene sequences and fungal ITS rDNA sequences. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a great diversity among the predominant phycobionts. The algal genus Asterochloris ( Trebouxiophyceae) was recovered in most sampled thalli , but two additional genera , Vulcanochloris and Chloroidium , were also found. We used variation-partitioning analyses to investigate the effects of climatic conditions , substrate/habitat characteristic , spatial distribution and mycobionts on phycobiont distribution. Based on an analogy , we examined the effects of climate , substrate/habitat , spatial distribution and phycobionts on mycobiont distribution. According to our analyses , the distribution of phycobionts is primarily driven by mycobionts and vice versa. Specificity and selectivity of both partners , as well as their ecological requirements and the width of their niches , vary significantly among the species-level lineages. We demonstrated that species-level lineages , which accept more symbiotic partners , have wider climatic niches , overlapping with the niches of their partners. Furthermore , the survival of lichens on substrates with high concentrations of heavy metals appears to be supported by their association with toxicity-tolerant phycobionts. In general , low specificity towards phycobionts allows the host to associate with ecologically diversified algae<pathogen> , thereby broadening its ecological amplitude.
