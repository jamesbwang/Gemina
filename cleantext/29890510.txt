  The Hippo signaling pathway ( HSP) has been identified as an essential and complex signaling pathway for tumor suppression that coordinates proliferation , differentiation , cell death , cell growth and stemness. In the present study , we conducted a genome-scale co-expression analysis to reconstruct the HSP in colorectal cancer ( CRC). Five key modules were detected through network clustering , and a detailed discussion of two modules containing respectively 18 and 13 over and down-regulated members of HSP was provided. Our results suggest new potential regulatory factors in the HSP. The detected modules also suggest novel genes contributing to CRC. Moreover , differential expression analysis confirmed the differential expression pattern of HSP members and new suggested regulatory factors between tumor and normal samples. These findings can further reveal the importance of HSP in CRC.
