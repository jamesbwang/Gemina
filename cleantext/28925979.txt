  The cubature Kalman filter ( CKF) is widely used in the application of GPS/INS integrated navigation systems. However , its performance may decline in accuracy and even diverge in the presence of process uncertainties. To solve the problem , a new algorithm named improved strong tracking seventh-degree spherical simplex-radial cubature Kalman filter ( IST-7thSSRCKF) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed algorithm , the effect of process uncertainty is mitigated by using the improved strong tracking Kalman filter technique , in which the hypothesis testing method is adopted to identify the process uncertainty and the prior state estimate covariance in the CKF is further modified online according to the change in vehicle dynamics. In addition , a new seventh-degree spherical simplex-radial rule is employed to further improve the estimation accuracy of the strong tracking cubature Kalman filter. In this way , the proposed comprehensive algorithm integrates the advantage of 7thSSRCKF & rsquo; s high accuracy and strong tracking filter & rsquo; s strong robustness against process uncertainties. The GPS/INS integrated navigation problem with significant dynamic model errors is utilized to validate the performance of proposed IST-7thSSRCKF. Results demonstrate that the improved strong tracking cubature Kalman filter can achieve higher accuracy than the existing CKF and ST-CKF , and is more robust for the GPS/INS integrated navigation system.
