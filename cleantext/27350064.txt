  This study explores the hypothesis that dominant molecular oncogenes in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) are associated with metastatic spread to the brain. NSCLC patient groups with no evidence of metastasis , with metastatic disease to a non-CNS site , who developed brain metastasis after diagnosis , and patients with simultaneous diagnosis of NSCLC and metastatic brain lesions<symptom> were studied using targeted sequencing. In patients with brain metastasis versus those without , only 2 variants ( one each in BCL6 and NOTHC2) were identified that occurred in ≥ 4 NSCLC of patients with brain metastases but ≤ 1 of the NSCLC samples without brain metastases. At the gene level , 20 genes were found to have unique variants in more than 33 % of the patients with brain metastases. When analyzed at the patient level , these 20 genes formed the basis of a predictive test to discriminate those with brain metastasis. Further analysis showed that PI3K/AKT signaling is altered in both the primary and metastases of NSCLC patients with brain lesions<symptom>. While no single variant was associated with brain metastasis , this study describes a potential gene panel for the identification of patients at risk and implicates PI3K/AKT signaling as a therapeutic target.
