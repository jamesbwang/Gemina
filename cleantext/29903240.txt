  To analysis the vitamin A nutritional status of 6-to 17-year-old children and adolescents between 2010-2012 in rural China. Based on the China Health and Nutrition Survey 2010-2012 project , the serum vitamin A samples of children and adolescents from survey sites of rural area were selected by random sampling method , and 5888 cases of samples were detected using the high performance liquid chromatography method to evaluate their vitamin A nutritional status. The serum retinol concentration of children and adolescents in rural area was ( 1. 44 ± 0. 58) μmol/L , and were ( 1. 40 ± 0. 56) μmol/L in general rural areas and ( 1. 46 ± 0. 60) μmol/L in poverty rural areas respectively ( t = 1. 88 , P < 0. 05). The serum retinol concentration of6-to 11-year-old were ( 1. 31 ± 0. 53) μmol/L and ( 1. 37 ± 0. 60) μmol/L , and serumretinol concentration of 12-to 17-year-old were ( 1. 52 ± 0. 57) μmol/L and ( 1. 52 ± 0. 60) μmol/L ( t = 11. 90 and t = 5. 54 , P < 0. 05). The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was 5. 53 % , and were 6. 14 % in general rural areas and 4. 55 % in poverty rural areas , respectively ( P > 0. 05). The prevalence of marginal vitamin A deficiency were 18. 75 % , and were 19. 17 % in general rural areas and 18. 07 % in poverty rural areas , respectively ( P > 0. 05). The situation of vitamin A deficiency in rural China are still widespread , the high prevalence of marginal vitamin A deficiency is more prominent.
