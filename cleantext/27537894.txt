  This paper proposes two novel , event-triggered fault-tolerant control strategies for a class of stochastic systems with state delays. The plant is disturbed by a Gaussian process , actuator faults , and unknown disturbances. First , a special case about fault signals that are coupled to the unknown disturbances is discussed , and then a fault-tolerant strategy is designed based on an event condition on system states. Subsequently , a send-on-delta transmission framework is established to deal with the problem of fault-tolerant control strategy against fault signals separated from the external disturbances. Two criteria are provided to design feedback controllers in order to guarantee that the systems are exponentially mean-square stable , and the corresponding H & infin;- norm disturbance attenuation levels are achieved. Two theorems were obtained by synthesizing the feedback control gains and the desired event conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities ( LMIs). Finally , two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.
