  It has been proved that hyperuricemia is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). The xanthine oxidase ( XO) inhibitor , febuxostat , decreases free fatty acids-induced fat accumulation in HFDT-fed mice. Here , it is shown that febuxostat attenuates fat accumulation and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in HepG2 cells. It was further found that the underlying mechanism is related to the reduction in expression of NLRP3/caspase -1/ IL-18/ IL-1beta and improved insulin resistance ( IR). This finding highlights the possible molecular pathways involving NLRP3 activation for management of ROS and insulin IR. In conclusion , febuxostat may be a promising potential treatment for patients with NAFLD.
