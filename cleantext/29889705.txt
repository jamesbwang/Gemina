  To be successful in their courses , nursing students must possess and routinely practice a wide range of self-regulated learning skills. Self-monitoring and regulation of cognition , metacognition , and behaviors influence learning for nursing practice. As reading and studying for comprehension , effective note taking , and taking tests successfully are challenging for many students , faculty at a rural community college created five self-regulated e-learning modules to equip prenursing students with evidence-based techniques to facilitate learning. This article describes the framework of self-regulated learning , the learning modules , student feedback , and implications for nurse educators.
