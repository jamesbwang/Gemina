  Obesity is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and its prevalence is increasing in all age groups , with the biggest impact observed in middle-aged and older adults. A critical mechanism by which obesity promotes vascular pathologies in these patients involves impairment of endothelial function. While endothelial dysfunction in large vessels promotes atherogenesis , obesity-induced microvascular endothelial dysfunction impairs organ perfusion and thereby is causally related to the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease , chronic kidney disease , intermittent claudication , exercise intolerance , and exacerbates cognitive decline in aging. Reduction of weight via calorie-based diet and exercise in animal models of obesity results in significant improvement of endothelial function both in large vessels and in the microcirculation , primarily due to attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom>. Clinical data on the protective effects of weight<symptom> loss<symptom> on endothelial function is limited to studies of flow-mediated dilation assessed in brachial arteries. Currently , there is no guideline on testing the effects of different weight management strategies on microvascular endothelial function in obese patients. Here , we provide proof-of-concept that weight loss-induced improvement of microvascular endothelial function can be reliably assessed in the setting of a geriatric outpatient clinic using a fast , reproducible , non-invasive method: laser speckle contrast imaging-based measurement of endothelium-dependent microvascular responses during post-occlusive reactive hyperemia<symptom> tests. Our study also provides initial evidence that short-term weight<symptom> loss<symptom> induced by consumption of a low-carbohydrate low-calorie diet can reverse microvascular endothelial dysfunction associated with obesity.
