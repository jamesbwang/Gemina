  Diced electrophoresis gel ( DEG) assay is a methodology to identify enzymes with a specified activity in complex cell or tissue lysates by means of two-dimensional separation using isoelectric focusing and native PAGE , followed by dicing of the gel into small pieces that are assayed separately , and digestion and peptide fingerprinting to identify the protein ( s) of interest in positive wells. The existing hand-made system has some disadvantages , and here we describe the development and validation of an improved cutter-plate system that enables simple , reliable and reproducible DEG assay in a 384-well plate-based format with signal readout using fluorometric or LC-MS-based reaction monitoring. To illustrate the usefulness of this system , we describe its application to profile esterase activities in ovarian adenocarcinoma SKOV3 cell lysate and mouse liver lysate that activate a fluorogenic substrate , fluorescein dibutyrate ( FDBu) , as well as esterase activities in mouse liver lysate that activate S-bromobenzylglutathione dicyclopentyl ester ( BBGDC) , a prodrug of anti-tumor agent S-bromobenzylglutathione. The activity spot patterns detected for FDBu and BBGDC were completely different , indicating that different metabolic systems are involved in hydrolysis of these substrates. The major detected spot in each case was identified. The developed system provides a highly reproducible general assay platform that should be useful for characterizing novel protein functions in complex bio-samples , as well as enzymomics studies.
