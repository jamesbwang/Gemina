  Thymidylate synthase ( TS) is a homodimeric enzyme with evidence for negative regulation of one protomer while the other protomer acts on substrate , so called half-the-sites reactivity. The mechanisms by which multisubunit allosteric proteins communicate between protomers is not well understood , and the simplicity of dimeric systems has advantages for observing conformational and dynamic processes that functionally connect distance-separated active sites. This review considers progress in overcoming the inherent challenges of accurate thermodynamic and atomic-resolution characterization of interprotomer communication mechanisms in symmetric protein dimers , with TS used as an example. Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC) is used to measure ligand binding cooperativity , even in cases where the two binding enthalpies are similar , and NMR spectroscopy is used to detect site-specific changes occurring in the two protomers. The NMR approach makes use of mixed-labeled dimers , enabling protomer-specific detection of signals in the singly ligated state. The rich informational content of the NMR signals from the singly ligated state , relative to the apo and saturated states , requires new considerations that do not arise in simple cases of 1:1 protein-ligand interactions.
