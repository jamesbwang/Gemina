  Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors ( ADGRs) encompass 33 human transmembrane proteins with long N termini involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We show the ADGRB1 gene , which encodes Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 ( BAI1) , is epigenetically silenced in medulloblastomas ( MBs) through a methyl-CpG binding protein MBD2-dependent mechanism. Knockout of Adgrb1 in mice augments proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors , and leads to accelerated tumor growth in the Ptch1
