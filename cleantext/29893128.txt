  Cell-penetrating peptides ( CPPs) can enter cells as a variety of biologically active conjugates and have various biomedical applications. To offset the cost and effort of designing novel CPPs in laboratories , computational methods are necessitated to identify candidate CPPs before in vitro experimental studies. We developed a two-layer prediction framework called machine-learning-based prediction of cell-penetrating peptides ( MLCPPs). The first-layer predicts whether a given peptide is a CPP or non-CPP , whereas the second-layer predicts the uptake efficiency of the predicted CPPs. To construct a two-layer prediction framework , we employed four different machine-learning methods and five different compositions including amino acid composition ( AAC) , dipeptide composition , amino acid index , composition-transition-distribution , and physicochemical properties ( PCPs). In the first layer , hybrid features ( combination of AAC and PCP) and extremely randomized tree outperformed state-of-the-art predictors in CPP prediction with an accuracy of 0.896 when tested on independent data sets , whereas in the second layer , hybrid features obtained through feature selection protocol and random forest<disease> produced an accuracy of 0.725 that is better than state-of-the-art predictors. We anticipate that our method MLCPP will become a valuable tool for predicting CPPs and their uptake efficiency and might facilitate hypothesis-driven experimental design.
