  The intrinsic near-infrared photoluminescence observed in long single-walled carbon nanotubes is known to be quenched in ultrashort nanotubes due to their tiny size as compared to the exciton diffusion length in these materials ( > 100 nm). Here , we show that intense photoluminescence can be created in ultrashort nanotubes ( âˆ¼ 40 nm length) upon incorporation of exciton-trapping sp
