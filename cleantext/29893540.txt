  P-type lead telluride ( PbTe) emerged as a promising thermoelectric material for intermediate-temperature waste-heat-energy harvesting. However , n-type PbTe still confronted with a considerable challenge owing to its relatively low figure of merit ZT and conversion efficiency η , limiting widespread thermoelectric applications. Here , we report that Ga-doping in n-type PbTe can optimize carrier concentration and thus improve the power factor. Moreover , further experimental and theoretical evidence reveals that Ga-doping-induced multiphase structures with nano- to micrometer size can simultaneously modulate phonon transport , leading to dramatic reduction of lattice thermal conductivity. As a consequence , a tremendous enhancement of ZT value at 823 K reaches ∼ 1.3 for n-type Pb
