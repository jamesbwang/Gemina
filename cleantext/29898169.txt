  To evaluate the effects of using a flipchart ( serial album<pathogen>) on maternal self-efficacy in breastfeeding and its effects on exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF) in children 's first two months of life. Clinical trial in Recife , Northeastern Brazil , with 112 women in the third trimester of gestation , randomly distributed in intervention group ( IG) and control group ( CG). The intervention was the use of the flipchart in IG. Data collection was performed through interviews in the prenatal period , and telephone contact at second , fourth and eighth weeks postpartum. The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short-Form ( BSES-SF) was used to measure self-efficacy scores. In the analysis , was used descriptive , bivariate statistics through tests of comparisons of proportions and means , and relative risk assessment. There was a statistically significant difference in mean values of self-efficacy scores between women in the IG and CG ( p < 0.001) and in EBF rates ( p < 0.001). The probability of exclusively breastfeeding in IG was twice as high than in CG ( RR 2.2 , CI 1.51-3.21). The use of a flipchart as an educational tool had positive effects on self-efficacy scores for breastfeeding and in maintenance of EBF in the IG. Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials: RBR-5N7K99.
