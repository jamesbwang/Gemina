  To study the long-term outcome following seizure<symptom> recurrence on antiepileptic drug ( AED) withdrawal after anterior temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We retrospectively studied the AED profile of patients who had a minimum of 5 years of postoperative follow-up after anterior temporal lobectomy for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Only those patients with hippocampal sclerosis or normal MRI were included. AED withdrawal was initiated at 3 months in patients on â‰¥ 2 drugs and at 1 year for patients on a single drug. Three hundred eighty-four patients with median postoperative follow-up of 12 years ( range , 7-17 years) were included. Of them , 316 patients ( 82.3 %) were seizure-free during the terminal 1 year. AED withdrawal was attempted in 326 patients ( 84.9 %). At last follow-up , AEDs were discontinued in 207 patients ( 53.9 %). Seizure<symptom> recurrence occurred in 92 patients ( 28.2 %) on attempted withdrawal. After a median postrecurrence follow-up of 7 years , 79 ( 86 %) of them were seizure-free during the terminal 2 years. AEDs could be stopped in 17 patients ( 18.5 %) and doses were reduced in another 57 patients ( 62 %). Patients with febrile seizures<symptom> , normal postoperative EEG at 1 year , and duration of epilepsy of < 20 years ( FND20 score) had 17 % risk of seizure<symptom> recurrence on attempted AED withdrawal. We also formulated a score to predict the chances of AED freedom for the whole cohort. Patients with seizure<symptom> recurrence on AED withdrawal have good outcome with 86 % becoming seizure-free and 18 % becoming drug-free after initial recurrence. A FND20 score helps in predicting recurrence on AED withdrawal.
