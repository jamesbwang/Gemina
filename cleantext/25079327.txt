  Hematopoietic stem cells require MLL1 , which is one of six Set1/Trithorax-type histone 3 lysine 4 ( H3K4) methyltransferases in mammals and clinically the most important leukemia<disease> gene. Here , we add to emerging evidence that all six H3K4 methyltransferases play essential roles in the hematopoietic system by showing that conditional mutagenesis of Setd1b in adult mice provoked aberrant homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs). Using both ubiquitous and hematopoietic-specific deletion strategies , the loss of Setd1b resulted in peripheral thrombo- and lymphocytopenia , multilineage dysplasia , myeloid-biased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen , and lethality. By transplantation experiments and expression profiling , we determined that Setd1b is autonomously required in the hematopoietic lineages where it regulates key lineage specification components , including
