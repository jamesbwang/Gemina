  The field of sports cardiology has advanced significantly over recent times. It has incorporated clinical and research advances in cardiac imaging , electrophysiology and exercise physiology to enable better diagnostic and therapeutic management of our patients. One important endeavour has been to try and better differentiate athletic cardiac remodelling from inherited cardiomyopathies and other pathologies. Whilst our diagnostic tools have improved , there have also been errors resulting from assumptions that the pathological traits observed in the general population would be generalisable to athletic populations. However , we have learnt that athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , for example , have many unique features when compared with non-athletic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We are learning the limitations of cross-sectional observations and a greater number of prospective studies have been initiated which should enable us to more confidently interrogate the associations between exercise , cardiac remodelling and clinical outcomes. This review of the field enables some of the world 's experts in sports cardiology to reflect on where there is a need for research focus to advance knowledge and clinical care in sports cardiology.
