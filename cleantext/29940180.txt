  In the current study , the interaction between phenobarbital and activated carbons which is driven by hydrophobic bonding was evaluated. The Two-Mechanism Langmuir-Like Equation ( TMLLE) was proposed to describe the isotherms for phenobarbital adsorbing to activated carbons. The parameters in the TMLLE obtained from the non-linear fitting of isotherms were used in the calculations of the differential Gibbs free energy for the hydrophobic bonding-driven interaction. Two thermodynamic models , the Modified Crisp Model and the va n't Hoff Equation , were adopted to estimate the differential Gibbs free energy. And , comparing the differential Gibbs free energy obtained from the two thermodynamic relationships , it can be determined that an adsorbing phenobarbital molecule displaces 12 water molecules on the hydrocarbon surfaces of the activated carbons ( hydrophobic bonding case). The difference between the estimates of the differential Gibbs free energy obtained by the Modified Crisp Model and by the va n't Hoff Equation provides a new experimental method to calculate the number of solvent molecules displaced by an adsorbing solute molecule. This is a completely general technique for the hydrophobic bonding-driven interaction , and is not limited to the systems studied. The calculated positive differential entropy confirmed that the adsorption process was entropy driven.
