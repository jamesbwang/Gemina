  Experiences during a stay in the intensive care unit ( ICU) , including pain , delirium<symptom> , physical deterioration , and the critical illness itself , may all influence survivors ' health-related quality of life ( HRQOL). However , few studies have examined the influence of social support , comorbidity , and pain interference on ICU survivors ' HRQOL. To investigate possible associations between social support , number of comorbidities , and pain interference on HRQOL in ICU survivors. ICU survivors responded to a survey 3 months ( n = 118) and 1 year ( n = 89) after ICU discharge. HRQOL was measured using the Short Form Health Survey-12 ( v1) , social support using the revised Social Provision Scale , pain interference using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form , and comorbidities using the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire. Physical and mental HRQOL were reduced at both 3 months and 1 year in ICU survivors compared with the general population. This reduction was more pronounced at 3 months for physical HRQOL , while a small reduction in mental HRQOL was not clinically relevant. Social support was statistical significantly positively associated with mental HRQOL at 3 months , while number of comorbidities was statistical significantly associated with a reduction in physical HRQOL at 3 months and 1 year and mental HRQOL at 1 year. Lastly pain interference was significantly associated with a reduction in physical HRQOL at 3 months and 1 year. ICU survivors primarily report reduced physical HRQOL. Social support was positively associated with mental HRQOL , while number of comorbidities , and pain interference were all significantly associated with a reduction in HRQOL. Pain interference was associated with the largest reduction in HRQOL.
