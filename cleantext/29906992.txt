  It is well recognized that there exist additional cubic terms of velocity in the lattice Boltzmann ( LB) model based on the standard lattice. In this work , elimination of these cubic terms in the pseudopotential LB model for multiphase flow is investigated , where the force term and density gradient are considered. By retaining high-order ( â‰¥ 3) Hermite terms in the equilibrium distribution function and the discrete force term , as well as introducing correction terms in the LB equation , the additional cubic terms of velocity are entirely eliminated. With this technique , the computational simplicity of the pseudopotential LB model is well maintained. Numerical tests , including stationary and moving flat and circular interface problems , are carried out to show the effects of such cubic terms on the simulation of multiphase flow. It is found that the elimination of additional cubic terms is beneficial to reduce the numerical error , especially when the velocity is relatively large. Numerical results also suggest that these cubic terms mainly take effect in the interfacial region and that the density-gradient-related cubic terms are more important than the other cubic terms for multiphase flow.
