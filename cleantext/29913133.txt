  Variants in IRF6 can lead to Van der Woude Syndrome<disease> and Popliteal Pterygium syndrome<disease>. Furthermore , genes upstream and downstream of IRF6 , including GRHL3 and TP63 , are also associated with orofacial clefting. Additionally , a variant in an enhancer ( MCS9 .7) that regulates IRF6 is associated with risk for isolated orofacial clefting. This variant ( rs642961) abrogates AP2A protein binding at MCS9 .7. Here , we found that AP2A protein regulates MCS9 .7 enhancer activity in vivo and IRF6 protein expression in epidermal development. In addition , loss of IRF6 leads to supra-basal expression of AP2A protein. Finally , using an IRF6 allelic series , we found that either increasing or decreasing IRF6 protein expression can destabilize AP2A protein expression in vivo. These data suggest that IRF6 regulates AP2A protein level in epidermal development. Therefore , we conclude that IRF6 and TFAP2A are part of a genetic regulatory network that is critical in epithelial development , with implications for both orofacial and cutaneous tissues. Our work provides in vivo , functional data to explain the relationship between AP2A protein binding and the MCS9 .7 enhancer in orofacial clefting. This work is important because the MCS9 .7 enhancer element contains a variant that abrogates AP2A protein binding and increases risk for orofacial clefting world-wide.
