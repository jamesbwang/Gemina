  γ-Al2O3 is an important catalyst and catalyst support of industrial interest. Its acid/base characteristics are correlated to the surface structure , which has always been an issue of concern. In this work , the complex ( sub-) surface oxygen species on surface-selectively labelled γ-Al2O3 were probed by 17O dynamic nuclear polarization surface-enhanced NMR spectroscopy ( DNP-SENS). Direct 17O MAS and indirect 1H-17O cross-polarization ( CP)/ MAS DNP experiments enable observation of the ( sub-) surface bare oxygen species and hydroxyl groups. In particular , a two-dimensional ( 2D) 17O 3QMAS DNP spectrum was for the first time achieved for γ-Al2O3 , in which two O ( Al) 4 and one O ( Al) 3 bare oxygen species were identified. The 17O isotropic chemical shifts ( δcs) vary from 56.7 to 81.0 ppm and the quadrupolar coupling constants ( CQ) range from 0.6 to 2.5 MHz for the three oxygen species. The coordinatively unsaturated O ( Al) 3 species is characterized by a higher field chemical shift ( 56.7 ppm) and the largest CQ value ( 2.5 MHz) among these oxygen sites. 2D 1H → 17O HETCOR DNP experiments allow us to discriminate three bridging ( Aln)- μ2-OH and two terminal ( Aln)- μ1-OH hydroxyl groups. The structural features of the bare oxygen species and hydroxyl groups are similar for the γ-Al2O3 samples isotopically labelled by 17O2 gas or H217O. The results presented here show that the combination of surface-selective labelling and DNP-SENS is an effective approach for characterizing oxides with complex surface species.
