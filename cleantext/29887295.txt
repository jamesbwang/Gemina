  This article investigates the relations among the tip-of-the-tongue ( TOT) state , event related potentials ( ERPs) to correct feedback to questions , and subsequent memory. ERPs were used to investigate neurocognitive responses to feedback to general information questions for which participants had expressed either being or not being in a TOT state. For questions in which participants were unable to answer within 3 s , they indicated whether they were experiencing a TOT state and then were immediately provided with the correct answer. Feedback during a TOT state , as opposed to not knowing the answer , was associated with enhanced positivity over centro-parietal electrodes 250-700 ms post-feedback , and this enhanced positivity mediated a positive relationship between TOTs and later recall. Although effects of increased semantic access during TOT states can not be ruled out , these results suggest that information received during TOT states elicits enhanced processing-suggestive of curiosity-leading to enhanced learning of studied material.
