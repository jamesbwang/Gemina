  Ubiquitylation is one of the most versatile protein post-translational modifications and is frequently altered during virus infections. Here we employed a functional proteomics screen to identify host proteins that are differentially ubiquitylated upon dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) infection. Among the several differentially modified proteins identified in infected cells was AUP1 , a lipid droplet-localized type-III membrane protein , which exists predominantly in the mono-ubiquitylated form. AUP1 associated with DENV<pathogen> NS4A and relocalized from lipid droplets to autophagosomes upon infection. Virus production was abolished in cells deleted for AUP1 or expressing an AUP1 acyltransferase domain mutant. Ubiquitylation disrupted the AUP1-NS4A interaction , resulting in inhibited acyltransferase activity , defective lipophagy , and attenuated virus production. Our results show that DENV-NS4A exploits the acyltransferase activity of AUP1 to trigger lipophagy , a process regulated by ubiquitylation. This mechanism appears to be a general phenomenon in biogenesis of flaviviruses and underscores the critical role of post-translational modifications in virus infections.
