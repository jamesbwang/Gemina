  Palmitate in breast milk is predominantly located in the triacylglycerol sn-2 position , while infant formulae contain palmitate predominantly in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions. During digestion , palmitate in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions is hydrolyzed to free palmitic acid that can subsequently complex with calcium to form insoluble soaps; this may partially explain why formula-fed infants have harder stools<symptom> than breast-fed infants. This large ( n = 488) randomized , double-blind , multicentre trial investigated whether increasing the sn-2 palmitate content of infant formula improves stool<symptom> consistency and bone mineral content ( measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) , without affecting growth or health. From ∼ 1 week to 4 months of age , infants were exclusively fed one of three formulae: i) control formula ( CF; 16 % of total palmitate at sn-2; n = 162) , ( ii) experimental formula 1 ( EF1; 43 % of total palmitate at sn-2; n = 166) or ( iii) experimental formula 2 ( EF2; 51 % of total palmitate at sn-2; n = 160). Intention-to-treat analysis showed softer stools<symptom> in both EF groups ( vs. CF) at ages 2 weeks and 1 and 2 months ( p ≤ 0.01) , but not 3 and 4 months. At 4 months , all groups had similar growth outcomes while bone mineral content was significantly higher in EF1 ( p = 0.0012) and EF2 ( p = 0.0002) compared with CF. Comparison of reported adverse events up to 12 months revealed no differences among groups. All 3 infant formulae exhibited equally good digestive tolerance. Formulae enriched in sn-2 palmitate fed in early infancy are safe , improve stool<symptom> consistency ( from 2 weeks to 2 months) and increase bone mineral content ( at 4 months).
