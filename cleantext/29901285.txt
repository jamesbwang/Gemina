  This study investigated the mediating role of sleeping problems in the relationship between workload and outcomes ( emotional exhaustion<symptom> , presenteeism , job satisfaction , and performance) , and overcommitment was examined as a moderator in the relationship between workload and sleeping problems. We conducted an empirical study using a sample of 884 teachers. Consistent with our predictions , results revealed that the positive indirect effects of workload on emotional exhaustion<symptom> and presenteeism , and the negative indirect effects of workload on job satisfaction and performance , through sleeping problems , were only significant among overcommitted teachers. Workload and overcommitment were also directly related to all four outcomes , precisely , they both positively related to emotional exhaustion<symptom> and presenteeism and negatively related to job satisfaction and performance. Theoretical contributions and perspectives and implications for practice are discussed.
