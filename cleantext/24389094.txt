  Fruit trees , such as apricot trees , are constantly exposed to the attack of viruses. As they are propagated in a vegetative way , this risk is present not only in the field , where they remain for decades , but also during their propagation. Metagenomic diagnostic methods , based on next generation sequencing ( NGS) , offer unique possibilities to reveal all the present pathogens in the investigated sample. Using NGS of small RNAs , a special field of these techniques , we tested leaf samples of different varieties of apricot originating from an isolator house or open field stock nursery. As a result , we identified Cherry virus A ( CVA) and little cherry virus 1 ( LChV-1) for the first time in Hungary. The NGS results were validated by RT-PCR and also by Northern blot in the case of CVA. Cloned and Sanger sequenced viral-specific PCR products enabled us to investigate their phylogenetic relationships. However , since these pathogens have not been described in our country before , their role in symptom development and modification during co-infection with other viruses requires further investigation.
