  Hypoperfusion plays a central role in shock<symptom> states , and has been proposed as a coagulopathy trigger. The study of the rotational thromboelastometry ( ROTEM) profile during cardiac arrest could offer new insights to the role of hypoperfusion in coagulation during shock<symptom> states. To describe the ROTEM profile in a cohort of asystole donors and elucidate the incidence of hyperfibrinolysis. A prospective observational study was carried out in 18 patients consecutively admitted to the ICU after out-of-hospital non-recovered cardiac arrest ( CA). Initial rhythm and time between CA and admission were recorded. Conventional coagulation and ROTEM ( EXTEM , APTEM , FIBTEM) tests were performed within 30minutes after blood sample collection. An asystole donor reference hospital. Patients admitted to the ICU after out-of-hospital non-recovered CA. The median age was 50 years , and 14 of the patients were men ( 77.8 %). The time from CA to hospital admission expressed as the median ( interquartile range) was 91minutes ( 75-104). The results of the routine tests were: INR 1.25 ( 1.19-1.34) , aPTT 55s ( 45-73) and fibrinogen 161mg/dl ( 95-295). For the ROTEM APTEM assay the results were: CT 126s ( 104-191) , CFT 247s ( 203-694). Hyperfibrinolysis criteria were recorded in 15 patients ( 83.3 %). In addition , MCF improved in APTEM versus EXTEM. Prolonged CA times were associated to lower fibrinogen levels and lower values for MCF FIBTEM ( P < .05). The ROTEM assays revealed severe alterations of the clot formation parameters and a high incidence of hyperfibrinolysis.
