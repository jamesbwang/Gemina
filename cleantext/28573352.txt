  Chlorination , the basic treatment utilized for drinking water sources , is widely used for water disinfection and pathogen elimination in water distribution networks. Thereafter , the proper prediction of chlorine consumption is of great importance in water distribution network performance. In this respect , data mining techniques-which have the ability to discover the relationship between dependent variable ( s) and independent variables-can be considered as alternative approaches in comparison to conventional methods ( e.g. , numerical methods). This study examines the applicability of three key methods , based on the data mining approach , for predicting chlorine levels in four water distribution networks. ANNs ( artificial neural networks , including the multi-layer perceptron neural network , MLPNN , and radial basis function neural network , RBFNN) , SVM ( support vector machine) , and CART ( classification and regression tree) methods were used to estimate the concentration of residual chlorine in distribution networks for three villages in Kerman Province , Iran. Produced water ( flow) , chlorine consumption , and residual chlorine were collected daily for 3 years. An assessment of the studied models using several statistical criteria ( NSC , RMSE , R
