  The purpose of this study was to determine whether combining a structural measure with contrast sensitivity perimetry ( CSP) , which has lower test-retest variability than static automated perimetry ( SAP) , reduces prediction error with two models of glaucoma progression. In this retrospective analysis , eyes with 5 visits with rim area ( RA) , SAP and CSP measures were selected from two datasets. Twenty-six eyes with open-angle glaucoma were included in the analyses. For CSP and SAP , mean sensitivity ( MS) was obtained by converting the sensitivity values at each location from decibel ( SAP) or log units ( CSP) to linear units , and then averaging all values. MS and RA values were expressed as percent of mean normal based on independent normative data. Data from the first 3 and 4 visits were used to calculate errors in prediction for the 4 and 5 visits , respectively. Prediction errors were obtained for simple linear regression and the dynamic structure-function ( DSF) model. With linear regression , the median prediction errors ranged from 6 % to 17 % when SAP MS and RA were used and from 9 % to 17 % when CSP MS and RA were used. With the DSF model , the median prediction errors ranged from 6 % to 11 % when SAP MS and RA were used and from 7 % to 16 % when CSP MS and RA were used. The DSF model had consistently lower prediction errors than simple linear regression. The lower test-retest variability of CSP in glaucomatous defects did not , however , result in lower prediction error.
