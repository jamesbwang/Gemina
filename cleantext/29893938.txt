  SSc is a rare CTD that affects multiple organ systems , resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. Evidence of interstitial lung disease ( ILD) is seen in âˆ¼ 80 % of patients with SSc. Currently there is no approved disease-modifying treatment for ILD and few effective treatment options are available. CYC is included in treatment guidelines , but it has limited efficacy and is associated with toxicity. MMF is becoming the most commonly used medication in clinical practice in North<pathogen> America and the UK , but its use is not universal. Newer agents targeting the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SSc-ILD , including fibrotic and inflammatory pathways , lymphocytes , cell-cell and cell-extracellular membrane interactions , hold promise for better treatment outcomes , including improved lung function , patient-related outcomes and quality of life. Here we review ongoing trials of established and novel agents that are currently recruiting patients with SSc-ILD.
