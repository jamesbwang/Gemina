  To evaluate the technical performance of the turbidimetric ACL-TOP CTS 300 coagulation analyzer ( IL) in dogs and cats and to create reference intervals for standard and novel parameters. Coagulation testing results from dogs and cats generated by the IL were prospectively compared with another mechanical clot detection system. Precision was documented and reference intervals were created for prothrombin time , activated partial thromboplastin time , and Clauss fibrinogen and D-dimer values , as well as for the quantitative clot curve parameters ( high and low amplitude , delta , and first and second derivative curves). Clot curve signatures containing common artifacts due to lipemia , hemolysis<symptom> , or preactivation were demonstrated. Residual frozen plasma from 20 dogs and 10 cats was used for method comparison; prospectively recruited healthy dogs ( n = 48) and cats ( n = 45) were used for reference interval and precision studies. Bland-Altman analysis showed a proportional positive bias in the IL compared with mechanical clot detection in dogs and a suggestion of a similar pattern in cats. Precision was good and met manufacturer 's recommendations for all assays. Reference intervals are reported. Clot curve artifacts were similar in animals to those reported in people. The turbidimetric system had a slight high proportional positive bias compared with mechanical clot detection. Thus , new reference intervals were generated including for novel parameters generated by clot curve analysis. Some preanalytical errors can be identified by inspection of clot curves. This robust novel technology compares favorably with mechanical endpoint detection methods and can be used in dogs and cats.
