  We investigate active electrolytes within the mean-field level of description. The focus is on how the double-layer structure of passive , thermalized charges is affected by active dynamics of constituting ions. One feature of active dynamics is that particles adhere to hard surfaces , regardless of chemical properties of a surface and specifically in complete absence of any chemisorption or physisorption. To carry out the mean-field analysis of the system that is out of equilibrium , we develop the `` mean-field simulation '' technique , where the simulated system consists of charged parallel sheets moving on a line and obeying active dynamics , with the interaction strength rescaled by the number of sheets. The mean-field limit becomes exact in the limit of an infinite number of movable sheets.
