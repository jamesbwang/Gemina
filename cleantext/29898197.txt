  There is a lack of studies on negative mood states and sexual risk behavior in men of all sexual orientations who seek treatment for excessive sexual behavior ( ESB). We aim to examine sexual compulsivity ( SC) , anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , and sexual risk behavior in a treatment-seeking sample of men and controls. We enrolled 88 ( 37 ( 42 %) gay or bisexual and 51 ( 58 %) heterosexual) ESB outpatients and 64 controls. Assessments included the Sexual Compulsivity Scale ( SCS) , the Beck Anxiety<symptom> Inventory ( BAI) , the Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory ( BDI) , and sexual risk behaviors. Compared to controls , ESB outpatients showed increased SC , anxiety<symptom> , and depression<symptom> , which were correlated. Regarding sex with casual partners , ESB outpatients reported more sexual intercourse , a greater number of partners , more anal intercourse , and unprotected anal intercourse. Anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , and SC were associated with protected vaginal intercourse with a main partner , whereas they were associated with unprotected anal intercourse with a casual partner. Depression<symptom> was associated with unprotected vaginal intercourse with a casual partner. Condomless anal intercourse was predicted by SC and was also reported by the heterosexual ESB outpatients ( 36 %). The data contribute to the field by providing information on men of all sexual orientations who are searching for mental healthcare. The connections among these psychopathological factors and sexual risk behavior have implications for public health , clinicians , and research.
