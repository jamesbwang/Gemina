  To investigate caprylic acid ( C8 ∶ 0) , capric acid ( C10 ∶ 0) or stearic acid ( C18 ∶ 0) on the absorption of exogenous cholesterol in mice. ApoE-/- mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: 2 % caprylic acid ( C8 ∶ 0) , capric acid ( C10 ∶ 0) or stearic acid ( C18 ∶ 0) were fed with high cholesterol diet for 16 weeks. Serum lipids and lipoproteins were measured at the beginning of the experiment , the 8 th week and the 16 th week. At 16 th weeks of intervention , 1 h and 4 h after ~ 3H-cholesterol intragastric administration , the contents of ~ 3H-cholesterol in the jejunum<symptom> , ileum and colon contents of mice were intragastric measured. Also the levels of ~ 3H-cholesterol in blood of0. 5 h , 1 h , 2 h and 4 h after administration were measured. Serum TC and LDL-c in the C8 ∶ 0 group were significantly lower than those in the C18: 0 group at the 8 th week of intervention ( P < 0. 01). Serum TC and LDL-c levels of the both C8 ∶ 0 group and C10 ∶ 0 group were significantly lower than those in the C18 ∶ 0 group at the 16 th week ( P < 0. 01). The contents of ~ 3H-cholesterol in the jejunum<symptom> of mice in C8 ∶ 0 group were significantly lower than those in C18 ∶ 0 group after 1 h of ~ 3H-cholesterol intragastric administration ( P < 0. 05). The contents of ~ 3H-cholesterol in the colon contents of mice in C8 ∶ 0 group were significantly higher than those in C18 ∶ 0 group after 1 h ( P < 0. 05) and4 h ( P < 0. 01) of ~ 3H-cholesterol intragastric administration. The ~ 3H-cholesterol content in blood in C8 ∶ 0 group were significantly lower than those in C18 ∶ 0 group after 0. 5 h and 2 h of intragastric administration ( P < 0. 01). And the area under the curve ( AUC) of ~ 3H-cholesterol in blood after 4 h of intragastric administration in C8 ∶ 0 group were significantly lower than those in C18 ∶ 0 group ( P < 0. 05). Caprylic acid could reduce the absorption of exogenous cholesterol in the intestinal tract and improve blood cholesterol metabolism of mice.
