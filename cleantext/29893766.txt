  previous cross-sectional studies have reported bidirectional associations between sexual activity and cognitive function among older people. However , the temporal associations have not been studied. community-dwelling men aged 70 + from the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project were assessed. This study was based on 986 men at baseline , 829 men at 2 year and 595 men at 5-year follow-up. Sexual function using a standardised questionnaire ( erectile function , sexual activity , sexual satisfaction , sexual desire) was analysed by generalised estimating equations to examine associations between changes in sexual function and changes in mini-mental state examination ( MMSE) across three time points over 5 years. Age , BMI , comorbidity , self-rated health , smoking , number of medications , country of birth , education , marital status , depression<symptom> and reproductive hormones were also measured at all time points. in unadjusted models , declines in erectile function ( β = -0.317) and sexual activity ( β = -0.575) over time were statistically significantly associated with a decline in MMSE over time. The associations observed in the unadjusted models remained after adjusting for a range of covariables. Declines in sexual satisfaction and sexual desire over time were not associated with changes in MMSE. our findings provide evidence of a longitudinal temporal relationship between sexual activity and cognitive function. Further studies are warranted to examine whether maintaining a healthy sexual life has a positive effect on cognitive function in older men.
