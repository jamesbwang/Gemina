  Age-related hearing decline typically includes threshold shifts as well as reduced wave I auditory brainstem response ( ABR) amplitudes due to cochlear synaptopathy/neuropathy , which may compromise precise coding of suprathreshold speech envelopes. This is supported by findings with older listeners , who have difficulties in envelope and speech processing , especially in noise. However , separating the effects of threshold elevation , synaptopathy , and degradation by noise on physiological representations may be difficult. In the present study , the effects of notched , low- and high-pass noise on envelope-following responses ( EFRs) in aging were compared when sound levels ( aged: 85-dB SPL; young: 60- to 80-dB SPL) were matched between groups peripherally , by matching wave I ABR amplitudes , or centrally by matching EFR amplitudes. Low-level notched noise reduced EFRs to sinusoidally amplitude-modulated ( SAM) tones<symptom> in young animals for notch widths up to 2 octaves. High-pass noise above the carrier frequency reduced EFRs. Young animals showed EFR reductions at lower noise levels. Low-pass noise did not reduce EFRs in either young or aged animals. High-pass noise may affect EFR amplitudes in young animals more than aged by reducing the contributions of high-frequency-sensitive inputs. EFRs to SAM tones<symptom> in modulated noise ( NAM) suggest that neurons of young animals can synchronize to NAM at lower sound<symptom> levels and maintain dual AM representations better than older animals. The overall results show that EFR amplitudes are strongly influenced by aging and the presence of a competing sound<symptom> that likely reduces or shifts the pool of responsive neurons.
