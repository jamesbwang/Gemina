  Transverse abdominis plane ( TAP) block is a peripheral nerve block designed to anaesthetise the nerves supplying the anterolateral abdominal wall ( T6 to L1). We introduced laparoscopic TAP block at Ninewells Hospital in 2014 and present a retrospective study assessing its efficacy. To our knowledge , there is limited study done on laparoscopic-guided TAP block whilst there are abundant literatures available on ultrasound-guided TAP block. To evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic-guided TAP block as postoperative analgesia following total laparoscopic hysterectomy ( TLH). A retrospective study was done between November 2014 to October 2016 ( 24 months) comparing patients who had TLH with TAP block ( Group 1; n = 45) and patients who had TLH without TAP block ( Group 2; n = 31) in our gynaecology unit. Patients were identified from theatre database. Data was collected from clinical portal and medical notes. The data included demographic information , BMI , METS score , intra-operative opiates use , post-operative pain scores , opiate requirements and use of patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA) , total dose of opiates used and day of discharge. The outcomes were analysed using means , odds ratios ( OR) , Mann-Whitney U-test and Fisher 's exact or Chi-square test with 95 % confidence interval ( CI). Patients in Group 1 were older ( mean age of 64.4 , range 38-87) when compared to Group 2 ( mean age of 49.3 , range 37-81). Group 1 and 2 had comparable mean BMI ( 30.34 vs. 30.02) and METS score ( 6.77 vs. 7.76). Mean post-operative pain scores were lower in Group 1 within 4 hours , in periods of 4-12 hours , 12-24 hours and 24-48 hours post-op. Smaller proportion of patients in Group 1 required opiates post-operatively in all periods as compared to Group 2. This was statistically significant in the periods of 12-24 hours post-op ( OR 0.31 , 95 % CI 0.11-0.82; p = .01). PCA use was significantly lower in Group 1 ( OR 0.02 , 95 % CI 0.0014-0.46; p = .01). Group 1 had lower mean total dose of opiates used ( 27.182 mg , range 0-102 mg) than Group 2 ( 59.452 mg , range 0-240 mg) , which was statistically significant ( p < .0001). Average post-op hospital stay was 1.3 and 1.8 days in Group 1 and 2 , respectively. Laparoscopic-guided TAP block delivered as post-operative analgesia following TLH results in reduced opiate requirement at post-operative period 12-24 hours , reduced PCA use and lower total dose of opiates used.
