  Fractures of talar body are uncommon injuries often associated with fractures of other long bones and in polytraumatized patients. The integrity of the talus is essential for the normal function of the ankle , subtalar , and midtarsal joints. The relative infrequency of this injury limits the number of studies available to guide treatment. They occur as a result of high-velocity trauma and are therefore associated with considerable soft tissue damage. Axial compression with supination or pronation is the common mechanism of injury. Great care is necessary for diagnosing and treating these injuries. Clinically , talar body fractures present with soft tissue swelling , hematoma , deformity , and restriction of motion. Associated neurovascular injury of the foot should be carefully examined. The initial evaluation should be done with foot , and ankle radiographs and computed tomography is often done to analyze the extent of the fracture , displacement , intraarticular extension , comminution , and associated fractures. Differentiating talar neck from body fractures is important. Optimal treatment relies on an accurate understanding of the injury and the goals of treatment are the restoration of articular surface and axial alignment. Indications for nonoperative management are seldom indicated and are few as in nonambulatory patients , or in with multiple comorbidities who are not able to tolerate surgery. Splinting , followed by short leg casting for 6 weeks until fracture union should be undertaken. Surgery is indicated in most of the cases , and different approaches have been described. Sometimes , a dual approach with a malleolar osteotomy is necessary for articular restoration. Clinical outcomes depend on the severity of the initial injury and the quality of reduction and internal fixation. The various complications are avascular necrosis<symptom> , malunion , infections , late osteoarthritis , and ankylosis of subtalar joint.
