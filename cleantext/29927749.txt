  Molecular graphics systems are visualization tools which , upon integration into a 3D immersive environment , provide a unique virtual reality experience for research and teaching of biomolecular structure , function and interactions. We have developed a molecular structure and dynamics application , the Molecular Dynamics Visualization tool , that uses the Unity game engine combined with large scale , multi-user , stereoscopic visualization systems to deliver an immersive display experience , particularly with a large cylindrical projection display. The application is structured to separate the biomolecular modeling and visualization systems. The biomolecular model loading and analysis system was developed as a stand-alone C# library and provides the foundation for the custom visualization system built in Unity. All visual models displayed within the tool are generated using Unity-based procedural mesh building routines. A 3D user interface was built to allow seamless dynamic interaction with the model while being viewed in 3D space. Biomolecular structure analysis and display capabilities are exemplified with a range of complex systems involving cell membranes<symptom> , protein folding and lipid droplets.
