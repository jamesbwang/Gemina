  Vibrio<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> is an important foodborne pathogen that is generally transmitted via raw or undercooked seafood. Endolysins originating from bacteriophages offer a new way to control bacterial pathogens. The objectives of this study were to sequence a novel lytic V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> phage VPp1 and determine the antibacterial activities of the recombinant endolysin ( LysVPp1) derived from this phage. The complete VPp1 genome contained a double-stranded DNA of 50,431 bp with a total G+C content of 41.35 %. The genome was predicted to encode 67 open reading frames ( ORFs) , which were organized as nucleotide metabolism , replication , structure , packaging , lysis , and some additional functions. Two tRNAs were encoded to carry anticodons UGG and CCA. Among the functional proteins , ORF33 was deduced to encode endolysin , whereas no holin/antiholin or Rz/Rz1 lysis gene equivalents were found in the VPp1 genome. ORF33 was cloned and expressed. The endolysin LysVPp1 could lyse 9 of 12 V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> strains , showing its relatively broader host spectrum than phage VPp1 , which lysed only 3 of 12 V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> strains. Furthermore , for EDTA-pretreated bacterial cells , the optical density of the LysVPp1 treatment group decreased by 0.4 at 450 nm , compared with less than 0.1 in control groups , demonstrating enhanced hydrolytic properties. These results contribute to the potential for development of novel enzybiotics for controlling
