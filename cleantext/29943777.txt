  In this work we present the results of photocurrent excitation spectroscopy ( PCE) of Gd3Al2Ga3O12: Ce3 + ( GAGG: Ce3 +) and Gd3Ga5O12: Ce3 + ( GGG: Ce3 +) performed at temperatures ranging from 100 to 500 K supplemented by spectroscopic measurements ( steady state and time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy) performed at temperatures ranging from 10 to 500 K and at high pressure up to 300 kbar. The PCE spectra contain bands related to transitions from the ground state 2F5/2 of the 4f1 electronic configuration to the crystal field split states related to the 5d1 electronic configuration of Ce3 +. This implicates the presence of the autoionization process- transfer of electrons from the localized , excited states of Ce3 + to the conduction band ( CB) , directly linked to luminescence quenching of Ce3 +. The mechanism of autoionization of GAGG: Ce3 + and GGG: Ce3 + was determined to be different on the grounds of differences in temperature dependence of photocurrent intensity. The latter system exhibits autoionization , which occurs when all of the 5d excited states are degenerated with the CB , whereas in the former system , the autoionization process is thermally assisted with an activation energy barrier ( distance to the edge of the CB) of approximately 1600 cm-1. In GGG: Ce3 + the degeneracy of 5d1 states of Ce3 + was lifted by application of high pressure , shifting the edge of the CB up and exposing Ce3 + luminescence at 20 kbar. Further spectroscopic analyses of the pressure-temperature dependence of the luminescence decay time as well as the temperature dependence of photocurrent intensity of GGG: Ce3 + have independently shown existence of a luminescence quenching state located approximately 600 cm-1 below the CB , attributed to the impurity trapped exciton.
