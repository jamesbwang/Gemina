  El Niño Southern Oscillation ( ENSO) is the most determining climate pattern in the tropics of the Pacific coast of America that regulate flood and drought periods. Over the last decades , Ecuador has incurred in significant economic losses due to drought events , around 4 % of the GDP , mainly in the agricultural and livestock sectors and the hydropower generation. The use of Drought Indicators and the Early Drought Detection can contribute to reduce the impacts of these events. A drought forecasting system , based on ENSO and Drought Indicators , is presented to determine the possibility of appearance of drought events in Manabí River Basin District ( MRBD). This system can help to the decision makers , in December ( short-term drought , seasonal) and in May ( long-term drought , annual) , to activate the drought measures in the following months. Six climate indices are used for ENSO: Oceanic Niño Index ( ONI) , Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI) , and Sea Surface Temperature ( SST) for Niño regions: 4 , 3.4 , 3 and 1 + 2. On the other hand , two drought indices are used: spatially distributed Standardized Precipitation Index ( SPI) -1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months- , and a modified Palmer Drought Severity Index ( PDSI) , derived from a calibrated water balance<symptom> model. This system allows early drought detection , assessing SST 1 + 2 ( lag -7) , 3 ( lag -9) and 3.4 ( lag -9) anomalies and drought indices , in December for a season drought and May for an annual drought. These analyses demonstrates that , drought may forecasting up to 7-9 months before their occurrence , through SST regions observations , based on strong relationship between ENSO and droughts occurrence.
