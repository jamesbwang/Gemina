  Circular RNAs ( circRNAs) , which were recently discovered as a special class of endogenous non-coding RNAs , have recently shown huge capabilities as gene regulators in different species in a wide variety of organisms including viruses , plants , archaea and animals. These circRNAs mainly arise from exons or introns in different combinations by special selective splicing and are enriched in cytoplasm. Apart from that , circRNAs usually display patterns of cell-type , tissue-type and developmental-stage specific expression in eukaryotic transcriptome. These findings hint at the vital function of circRNAs in development and diseases. Hereinafter , we summarize the current understanding of the molecular characteristics of circRNAs and discuss their proposed functions and mechanism-of-action in human<disease> diseases<disease> , animals as well as botanics.
