  The reactive oxygen metabolites ( d-ROMs) test has recently been explored as a novel marker of oxidative stress A total of 428 elderly outpatients with CHF with no history of HF hospitalization ( 108 males , 320 females; mean age , 75 ± 7 years) were enrolled. Based on the median value of d-ROMs test levels ( 303 U.CARR) , the patients were divided into the following two groups: group L ( low d-ROMs test levels) and group H ( high d-ROMs test levels). The utility of the d-ROMs test as a predictor of initial HF hospitalization was evaluated. During the 88.1-month follow-up period , 58 HF cases were hospitalized ( group L , 17 cases; group H , 41 cases; P < 0.001 , log-rank test). Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that group H exhibited a significantly higher risk for HF hospitalization than did group L ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 2.35; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.37- 4.43; P < 0.01). Furthermore , the HR ( vs. group L with low brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP) levels ( < 200 pg/mL) , HR , 9.18; 95 % CI , 4.78- 22.94; P < 0.001) for the incidence of HF hospitalization increased in group H with high BNP levels ( ≥ 200 pg/mL). The present study demonstrates that high d-ROMs test levels predict initial HF hospitalization in elderly patients with CHF. In addition , the predictive value for the incidence of HF hospitalization increases by using a combination of two biomarkers as d-ROMs test and BNP levels.
