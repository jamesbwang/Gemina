  Surface-specific nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy , combined with bulk solution measurements and imaging , is used to study the surface conditions during the growth of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. As a result of the silica high surface charge density , the water structure at the silica-aqueous interface is known to be especially sensitive to pH and ionic strength , and surface concentration profiles develop that can be appreciably different from the bulk solution conditions. We illustrate that , in the presence of growing cells , a unique surface micro-environment is established as a result of metabolites accumulating on the silica surface. Even in the subsequent absence of the cells , this surface layer works to reduce the interfacial ionic strength as revealed by the enhanced signal from surface water molecules. In the presence of growing cells , an additional boost in surface water signal is attributed to a local pH that is higher than that of the bulk solution.
