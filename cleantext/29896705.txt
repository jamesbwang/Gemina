  The Agilent Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer can be used to measure the oxygen consumption rate ( OCR) and extra cellular acidification rate ( ECAR) , from which mitochondrial bioenergetics measurements can be determined including basal respiration<symptom> , respiration<symptom> due to ATP turnover , uncoupled respiration/proton leak , and maximum respiration<symptom>. This novel method demonstrates how to use a Seahorse XF 24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer to measure the bioenergetic flux of zebrafish embryos in vivo during development. This provides a tool that enables characterization of metabolic parameters in a living organism , utilizing Agilent Islet Capture Microplates where respiration<symptom> parameters can be compared between controls and genetically altered/pharmacologically treated embryos in real time. This method can be used to analyze and identify novel pharmaceuticals and genes that influence respiration<symptom> , mitochondrial function , and metabolism.
