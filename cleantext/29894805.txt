  Cardiovascular diseases are a prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality especially in industrialized countries. The human phosphatase and actin regulator 1 ( PHACTR1) may be involved in such diseases , but its precise regulatory function remains unclear due to the large number of potential interaction partners. The same phenomenon makes this protein difficult to express in mammalian cells , but it is also an intrinsically disordered protein that likely aggregates when expressed in bacteria due to the absence of chaperones. We therefore used a design of experiments approach to test the suitability of three plant-based systems for the expression of satisfactory quantities of recombinant PHACTR1 , namely transient expression in tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 plant cell packs ( PCPs) , whole N. benthamiana leaves and BY-2 cell lysate ( BYL). The highest yield was achieved using the BYL: up to 120 mg product kg
