  Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP) for HIV<pathogen> prevention with daily TDF/FTC is effective when taken consistently. Currently , there is no objective way to monitor PrEP adherence. Urine has been shown to be highly correlated with plasma tenofovir levels , with urine tenofovir levels > 1000ng/mL demonstrating recent ( 1-2 days) adherence to PrEP. The present study was conducted at an urban community health center in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania. PrEP was administered to 50 young men who have sex with men and transgender women of color using weekly , biweekly , and/or monthly dispensation schedules. Primary objectives were retention at 48 weeks ( in care at week 48 and completing â‰¥ 50 % of medication pick-ups) and adherence assessed by urine tenofovir levels. Risk behaviors and sexually transmitted infections ( STIs) diagnoses were also collected. 70 % of participants were retained in care at 48 weeks. The proportion of subjects with urine tenofovir consistent with recent adherence was 80 % , 74.4 % , 82.4 % , 82.4 % and 69.7 % at weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , and 48 respectively. 61 STIs were diagnosed over 231 screenings throughout 48 weeks , with no significant change between the first and second 24-week periods ( p = 0.43; 0 seroconversions). At week 48 , more than half of subjects reported an increase or no change in condom use , an increase in their ability to discuss HIV<pathogen> with partners , and no change in number of sexual partners from baseline. These data demonstrate PrEP can be successfully delivered to a high-risk population with high program retention and medication adherence measured by urine tenofovir levels.
