  Previous studies have shown that chronic stress and chronic stress hormone treatment induce oxidative damage in rodents. Thioredoxin ( Trx) is a small redox protein that plays an important role in regulation of oxidative protein cysteine modification. A Trx reduced state is maintained by thioredoxin reductase ( TrxR) , and the thioredoxin-interacting protein ( Txnip) is an endogenous inhibitor of Trx. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic treatment with stress hormone corticosterone on Trx , TrxR and Txnip in cultured neuronal cells. Using immunoblotting analysis we found that although chronic corticosterone treatment had no effect on Trx and TrxR protein levels , this treatment significantly increased Txnip protein levels. Using immunocytochemistry we also found that chronic corticosterone treatment increased Txnip in both nucleus and cytosol , while glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor RU486 can block corticosterone-increased Txnip protein levels. Using biotin switch , dimedone conjugation and CRISPR/Cas9 methods we found that chronic corticosterone treatment increased protein nitrosylation and sulfenylation , while knocking out Txnip blocked corticosterone-induced protein nitrosylation and sulfenylation. Since Trx can reduce cysteine oxidative protein modification such as nitrosylation and sulfenylation , our findings suggest that chronic corticosterone treatment may upregulate Txnip by targeting glucocorticoid receptor , subsequently inhibiting Trx activity and enhancing oxidative protein cysteine modification , which contributes to corticosterone-caused oxidative damage.
