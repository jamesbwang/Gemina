  The treatment of focal epilepsies is largely predicated on the concept that there is a `` focus '' from which the seizure<symptom> emanates. Yet , the physiological context that determines if and how ictal activity starts and propagates remains poorly understood. To delineate these phenomena more completely , we studied activity outside the seizure-onset zone prior to and during seizure<symptom> initiation. Stereotactic depth electrodes were implanted in 17 patients with longstanding pharmacoresistant epilepsy for lateralization and localization of the seizure-onset zone. Only seizures<symptom> with focal onset in mesial temporal structures were used for analysis. Spectral analyses were used to quantify changes in delta , theta , alpha , beta , gamma , and high gamma frequency power , in regions inside and outside the area of seizure<symptom> onset during both preictal and seizure<symptom> initiation periods. In the 78 seizures<symptom> examined , an average of 9.26 % of the electrode contacts outside of the seizure<symptom> focus demonstrated changes in power at seizure<symptom> onset. Of interest , seizures<symptom> that were secondarily generalized , on average , showed power changes in a greater number of extrafocus electrode contacts at seizure<symptom> onset ( 16.7 %) compared to seizures<symptom> that remained focal ( 3.8 %). The majority of these extrafocus changes occupied the delta and theta bands in electrodes placed in the ipsilateral , lateral temporal lobe. Preictally , we observed extrafocal high-frequency power decrements , which also correlated with seizure<symptom> spread. This widespread activity at and prior to the seizure-onset time further extends the notion of the ictogenic focus and its relationship to seizure<symptom> spread. Further understanding of these extrafocus , periictal changes might help identify the neuronal dynamics underlying the initiation of seizures<symptom> and how therapies can be devised to control seizure<symptom> activity.
