  To determine whether differences in birth outcomes among assisted reproductive technology ( ART)- treated , subfertile , and fertile women exist in primiparous women with , singleton , vaginal deliveries. Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System ( SART CORS) data were linked to Massachusetts vital records and hospital discharges for deliveries between July 2004 and December 2010. Primiparous women with in-state vaginal deliveries , adequate prenatal care , and singleton birth at ≥ 20 weeks ( n = 117,779) were classified as ART-treated ( linked to ART data from SART CORS , n = 3138); subfertile ( not ART-treated but with indicators of subfertility , n = 1507); or fertile ( neither ART-treated nor subfertile , n = 113,134). Outcomes of prematurity ( < 37 weeks) , low birthweight ( < 2500 g) , perinatal death ( death at ≥ 20 weeks to ≤ 7 days) , and maternal prolonged length of hospital stay ( LOS > 3 days) were compared using multivariable logistic regression. Compared to fertile , higher odds were found for prematurity among ART-treated ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) 1.40 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.25-1.50) and subfertile ( AOR 1.25 , 95 % CI 1.03-1.50) women , low birthweight among ART-treated ( AOR 1.41 , 95 % CI 1.23-1.62) and subfertile ( AOR 1.40 , 95 % CI 1.15-1.71) women , perinatal death among subfertile ( AOR 2.64 , 95 % CI 1.72-4.05) , and prolonged LOS among ART-treated ( AOR 1.33 , 95 % CI 1.19-1.48) women. Differences remained despite stratification by young age and absence of pregnancy/delivery complications. Greater odds of prematurity and low birthweight in ART-treated and subfertile , and perinatal death in subfertile deliveries are evident among singleton vaginal deliveries. The data suggest that even low-risk pregnancies to ART-treated and subfertile women be managed for adverse outcomes.
