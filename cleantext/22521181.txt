  Muscle Dysmorphia ( MD) is a psychological disorder characterized by the preoccupation with the idea that one 's body is not lean and muscular. The current study aimed to explore MD behaviours and symptoms in three groups of recreational athletes: bodybuilders ( BB; n = 42) , strength athletes ( SA; n = 61) , and fitness practitioners ( FP; n = 22). Furthermore , we assessed MD-related psychological features as well as possible psychological predictors of MD among groups. Results highlighted that the BB group reported more beliefs about being smaller and weaker than desired compared to the other groups , whereas individuals in the SA group reported setting higher standards for themselves than the FP group. Lastly , orthorexia nervosa and social anxiety<symptom> symptoms emerged as predictors of MD symptoms in the BB group. Taken together , our findings suggest that individuals in the BB group are characterized by more MD general symptomatology than those in the other groups; furthermore , only orthorexia nervosa and social anxiety<symptom> may play a specific role in predicting MD general symptoms in bodybuilders.
