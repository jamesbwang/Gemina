  This study evaluated the effects of topically applied axitinib , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , in an experimental model of corneal neovascularization ( CNV). A total of 48 New Zealand rabbits were used. CNV was induced by placing five silk sutures in the upper cornea of one eye per rabbit. Rabbits were randomized into four groups ( 12 rabbits each): 0.9 % saline ( control group) , 0.02 mg/mL axitinib , 0.35 mg/mL axitinib and 0.5 mg/mL axitinib groups. All treatments were administered three times daily for 14 days. Photographs were taken using a slit lamp on days 7 and 14. The area of neovascularization was measured in mm On day 14 , the CNV area in the control group ( 31.50 Â± 7.47 mm Topical administration of the three axitinib concentrations inhibited CNV in rabbits , blocking both vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor pathways. Axitinib at 0.5 mg/mL induced profound inhibition of corneal angiogenesis.
