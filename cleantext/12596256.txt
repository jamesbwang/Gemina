  A population of descending neurons connect the brain and thoracic motor center , playing a critical role in controlling behavior. We examined the anatomical organization of descending neurons ( DNs) in the brain of the silkmoth Bombyx mori. Moth pheromone orientation is a good model to investigate neuronal mechanisms of behavior. Based on mass staining and single-cell staining , we evaluated the anatomical organization of neurite distribution by DNs in the brain. Dense innervation was observed in the posterior-ventral part of the brain called the posterior slope ( PS). We analyzed the morphology of DNs innervating the lateral accessory lobe ( LAL) , which is considered important for moth olfactory behavior. We observed that all LAL DNs also innervate the PS , suggesting the integration of signals from the LAL and PS. We also identified a set of DNs innervating the PS but not the LAL. These DNs were sensitive to the sex pheromone , suggesting a role of the PS in motor control for pheromone processing. Here we discuss the organization of descending pathways for pheromone orientation.
