  Genetic resource banks ( GRB) are a valuable tool for maintaining genetic variability and preserving breeds from pathogens or catastrophe , enabling us to assess and correct breeding schemes , minimizing the impact of genetic drift and facilitating diffusion. This study tests their efficiency in re-establishing two extinct populations of a synthetic rabbit line selected for daily weight gain , using vitrified embryos from two generations ( 18th and 36th) separated by 15 years of genetic selection. The effect of long-term storage of vitrified embryos in liquid nitrogen was also evaluated. A total of 516 vitrified embryos using the same protocol were transferred into 54 recipients. The embryos had been maintained in liquid nitrogen during 2 different periods , ( i) 1 year ( 301 embryos and 26 transfers , 36th generation) and ( ii) 15 years ( 259 embryos and 28 transfers , 18th generation). A total of 80.0 % ( 8/10 to 18th) and 60.0 % ( 9/15 to 36th) of the foundational sire families were eventually re-established. Over approximately one year , animals within each population were crossed to produce the next generation and re-establish the original population size. Our study demonstrated that our GRB of embryos vitrified 15 years ago is a successful strategy to re-establish rabbit populations to continue the breeding programme.
