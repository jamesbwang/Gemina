  Segmental Le Fort I osteotomy , a complex procedure with many mobile parts , has traditionally required presurgical orthodontics with conventional braces , composed of metal brackets , bands , and archwires. These appliances are not always accepted by patients , particularly older teenagers and professional adults who previously endured traditional orthodontia during adolescence , and now require retreatment because of jaw growth differences necessitating orthognathic surgery. Less obtrusive orthodontic therapies , involving clear aligners ( e.g. , Invisalign) , are becoming increasingly popular , as they are less noticeable and less aesthetically objectionable. They are typically indicated for milder occlusal discrepancies , such as crowding and minor rotations , without significant vertical or transverse problems. Clear aligners in conjunction with orthognathic surgery for severe dentofacial problems are progressive and not widely used. Moreover , the most complicated of orthognathic sequences , segmental double-jaw surgery , has never before been described to be performed using Invisalign. Several potential challenges exist when performing segmental double-jaw surgery with Invisalign ( i.e. , no bonded or banded appliances , and no archwire). The purpose of this article is to review the feasibility of segmental double-jaw surgery without orthodontia ( Invisalign only) , report a series of cases , and review the technical steps involved.
