  Research on Faster R-CNN has recently witnessed the progress in both accuracy and execution efficiency in detecting objects such as faces , hands or pedestrians in photograph or video. However , constrained by the size of its convolution feature map output , it is unable to clearly detect small or tiny objects. Therefore , we presented a fast , deep convolutional neural network based on a modified Faster R-CNN. Multiple strategies , such as fast multi-level combination , context cues , and a new anchor generating method were employed for small object detection in this paper. We demonstrated performance of our algorithm both on the KITTI-ROAD dataset and our own traffic scene lane markings dataset. Experiments demonstrated that our algorithm obtained better accuracy than Faster R-CNN in small object detection.
