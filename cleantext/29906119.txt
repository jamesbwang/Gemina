  Hydrogen bonds to metal-ligands in proteins play a vital role in biological function. They help to stabilize/protect the metal complex and enhance metal-binding affinity/specificity , enzyme-substrate recognition , and enzyme activation. Yet , knowledge of the preferred hydrogen-bonding partners of metal ligands in different metalloproteins is lacking. Using well-calibrated methods , we have determined the preferred hydrogen-bonding partners of Cys
