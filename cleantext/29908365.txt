  Two eye-movement experiments were conducted to examine the effects of font type on the recognition of words presented in central vision , using a variable-viewing-position technique. Two main questions were addressed: ( 1) Is the optimal viewing position ( OVP) for word recognition modulated by font type? ( 2) Is the cursive font more appropriate than the printed font in word recognition in children who exclusively write using a cursive script? In order to disentangle the role of perceptual difficulty associated with the cursive font and the impact of writing habits , we tested French adults ( Experiment 1) and second-grade French children , the latter having exclusively learned to write in cursive ( Experiment 2). Results revealed that the printed font is more appropriate than the cursive for recognizing words in both adults and children: adults were slightly less accurate in cursive than in printed stimuli recognition and children were slower to identify cursive stimuli than printed stimuli. Eye-movement measures also revealed that the OVP curves were flattened in cursive font in both adults and children. We concluded that the perceptual difficulty of the cursive font degrades word recognition by impacting the OVP stability.
