  Health problems are substantially increased in homeless populations who have higher prevalence 's of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> than do general population. They have relatively earlier onset of sexual activity , and due to lack of information , many facilities for the practice of unprotected sex and low level of condom usage increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs). This study aims to identify the knowledge and prevention of STIs among homeless people. An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted in a Tbilisi municipal shelter. Within the framework of the quantitative research , the beneficiaries were interviewed with a self-administered questionnaire. Most of the respondents ( 98 %) have heard about STIs , but their health literacy is low. Although respondents knew the risk factors for STIs , they had a high degree of risk-taking sexual behavior evidenced by the very low percentage using condoms ( 15.2 %) and a large proportion having multiple partners ( 54.3 %). It is necessary to raise awareness about STIs and promote sexual education of respondents at the municipal shelter.
