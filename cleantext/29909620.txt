  The absorption spectrum of quinoline was measured in the gas phase between 3.5 and 10.7 eV using a synchrotron photon source. A large number of sharp and broad spectral features were observed , some of which have plasmon-type collective π-electron modes contributing to their intensities. Eight valence electronic transitions were assigned , considerably extending the number of π-π * transitions previously observed mainly in solution. The principal factor in solution red-shifts is found to be the Lorentz-Lorenz polarizability parameter. Rydberg bands , observed for the first time , are analyzed into eight different series , converging to the D
