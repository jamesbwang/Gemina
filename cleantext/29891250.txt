  To determine whether nicorandil administration distal to the thrombus in the coronary artery during percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) patients reduced the incidence of no-reflow phenomenon , reperfusion injury , and adverse events. This randomised controlled trial involved 170 STEMI patients who underwent PCI. All patients underwent thrombectomy and tirofiban injection ( 10Î¼g/kg) distal to the vascular lesion<symptom> via a suction catheter , followed by nicorandil ( 84 patients; 2 mg) or saline injection ( 86 patients; 2mL) at the same site. The primary endpoint ( major adverse cardiac events , MACEs) was 6-month cardiovascular mortality or unplanned readmission rate due to worsening congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The secondary endpoints were thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ( TIMI) grade , TIMI myocardial perfusion grade ( TMPG) , resolution of ST-segment elevation ( defined as > 50 % decrease in ST elevation); and ventricular arrhythmias. Upon Kaplan-Meier analysis , freedom from MACEs was 92.9 % in the nicorandil group and 81.4 % in the placebo ( p = 0.026). The numbers of patients achieving TIMI grade 3 ( 95.24 % vs. 86.05 %; p = 0.040) and TMPG 3 ( 94.05 % vs. 83.72 %; p = 0.033) were greater in the nicorandil group than in the control group. Resolution of ST-segment elevation occurred in 84.52 % and 68.60 % patients in the nicorandil and control groups , respectively ( p = 0.014). Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 5.95 % and 16.28 % patients in the nicorandil and control groups , respectively ( p = 0.032). Early administration of nicorandil distal to the vascular lesion<symptom> during PCI in STEMI patients may reduce the incidence of reperfusion injury , and improve short-term clinical outcomes.
