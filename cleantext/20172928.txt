  Transient<symptom> loss<symptom> of consciousness<symptom> represents one of the most frequent reasons for patients to present in the emergency room. Already at the very beginning , the diagnostic work-up is faced with fundamental questions: ( 1) Was it really a loss of consciousness<symptom>? ( 2) Which department ( neurology , cardiology , or others) should check the patient? ( 3) Is an in-hospital diagnostic work-up required? These questions can be answered from a meticulous patient history which needs to be adjusted to the individual case but also has to systematically go through a list of questions. Patient history has to clarify whether syncope was present. Nonsyncopal events such as falls , transient global amnesia , epilepsy , psychogenic pseudosyncope , transient ischemic attack and drop attacks should be distinguished. In a second step , the four groups of causes of syncope can be assessed. Neurocardiogenic reflex syncope usually occurs with typical prodromes in typical situations in ( younger) patients without heart disease. Orthostasis always occurs in upright position , typically associated with standing up and in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs. Arrhythmogenic syncope frequently shows an abrupt onset without prodromes , associated with injury and with palpitations or fast heart beat before the attack , in older patients frequently associated with known heart disease , in young patients without heart disease frequently with a family history positive for arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. A positive history of structural cardiovascular disease should be considered as a cause of syncope , particularly if it occurs during exercise or in supine position , or is associated with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> or dyspnea<symptom>. This review summarizes the most important questions that can elucidate the cause of syncope.
