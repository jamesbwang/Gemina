  Artificial intelligence and the underlying methods of machine learning and neuronal networks ( NN) have made dramatic progress in recent years and have allowed computers to reach superhuman performance in domains that used to be thought of as uniquely human. In this overview , the underlying methodological developments that made this possible are briefly delineated and then the applications to psychiatry in three domains are discussed: precision medicine and biomarkers , natural language processing and artificial intelligence-based psychotherapeutic interventions. In conclusion , some of the risks of this new technology are mentioned.
