  Attentional impairments are among the earliest identifiable features of autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs). Three attention networks have been extensively studied using the attention network test ( ANT) , but this long and repetitive task may pose challenges for individuals with ASDs. The AttentionTrip was developed as a more engaging measure of attention network efficiency. In 20 adults with ASDs and 20 typically developing controls , both tasks produced typical network scores ( all p < .003 , all Cohen 's d > 0.78). Reaction time was less variable in the AttentionTrip than the ANT , possibly reflecting improved task engagement. Although the AttentionTrip elicited more consistent responses throughout an experimental session , anomalously low split-half reliability for its executive control network suggests that some changes may be needed.
