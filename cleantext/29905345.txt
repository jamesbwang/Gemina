  We report the selective functionalization of an edge of graphene via the electrografting of 4-nitrobenzene diazonium tetrafluoroborate. The edge- a single line of carbon atoms- forms during the process of cutting a graphene monolayer with an atomically sharp microtome knife. Embedded in a polymeric matrix , the just cut bare graphene edge efficiently transfers electrons to a ferricyanide probe in solution. By monitoring the electron exchange reactions of the edge upon functionalization , we observe an annihilation of the reduction and oxidation peaks of the ferricyanide probe , characteristic of the formation of a nitroaryl passivation layer on the edge of graphene. For the first time , the chemical state of a single line of carbon atoms is influenced and monitored using an electrochemical cell , therefore bypassing the usual requirements of atomic resolution characterization techniques , which often demand very clean graphene samples and vacuum processing.
