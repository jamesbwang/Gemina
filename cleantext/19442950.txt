  The purpose of this study is to elucidate the impact of out-stent plaque characteristics on vascular response after implantation of second generation drug-eluting stent ( G2-DES). Enrolled were 37 patients with 39 coronary artery lesions<symptom> into which three types of G2-DES were successfully implanted ( 9 Nobori biolimus- , BES; 15 Xience everolimus- , EES; 15 Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents; R-ZES). Immediately after ( baseline) and one year after the implantation ( follow-up) , iMAP-intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS) was performed to measure out-stent plaque volume ( OSPV) and its components. Percent OSPV and vulnerable plaque index ( VPI) were defined as percentile of OSPV to vessel volume and as percentile of lipidic plus necrotic volume to OSPV. Coronary angioscopy at follow-up rated the degree of arterial repair by neointimal stent coverage ( NSC). Poor<symptom> NSC was found in approximately 60 % of each G2-DES. In BES , % OSPV at baseline was significantly greater in poor NSC than in good NSC ( 36.2 ± 3.9 vs. 27.3 ± 4.0 % , P = 0.01). In EES , % OSPV was significantly greater in poor NSC than in good NSC ( 41.0 ± 4.1 vs. 32.6 ± 2.7 % , P < 0.01). In R-ZES implantation , there was no significant difference with regards to % OSPV between poor and good NSC. In BES , VPI at baseline was significantly greater in poor NSC than good NSC ( 54.0 ± 5.8 vs. 42.2 ± 5.1 % , P = 0.02). There was no significant difference with regards to VPI between poor and good NCS in EES and R-ZES. Impact of out-stent plaque characteristics on vascular response was different among the three types of G2-DES.
