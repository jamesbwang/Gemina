  Tricalcium citrate ( TCC) was characterized as a tableting excipient for direct compression ( DC) and dry granulation ( DG). Brittle materials usually lead to tablets of inferior mechanical strength compared to plastic deforming materials. A brittle material exhibiting a high tabletability with the ability to retain that behavior during recompression would represent a valuable alternative to the commonly used microcrystalline cellulose. Tablets of TCC and other common fillers were directly compressed for the purpose of compression analysis including Heckel analysis , speed dependency , and lubricant sensitivity. DG by roller compaction of TCC was first simulated via briquetting and experiments were subsequently repeated on a roller compactor. TCC appears as an excellent flowing powder of large agglomerates consisting of lower micron to submicron platelets. Despite the brittle deformation mechanism identified in the Heckel analysis , TCC demonstrated a very high mechanical strength up to 11 MPa in conjunction with an astonishingly low solid fraction of 0.85 at a compression pressure of 400 MPa. This was seen along with hardly any speed and lubricant sensitivity. Nevertheless , disintegration time was very short. TCC tablets suffered only a little from the re-compression: a slight loss in tensile strength of 1-2 MPa was observed for granules produced via roller compaction. TCC was found to be suitable for DC as a predominantly brittle deforming filler , nevertheless demonstrating an enormous hardness yield while being independent of lubrication and tableting speed. TCC furthermore retained enough bonding capacity after DG to maintain this pronounced tabletability.
