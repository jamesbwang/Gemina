  Cardiac tumors are exceptional cardiac conditions , since they have a minimal occurrence , according to statistics. The cardiac myxoma cases are the most dominant for the representative examples for these clinical situations. Those tumors being benign , the patients enjoy a reasonable life expectancy provided they receive an early diagnosis. In the absence of potential complications , the symptoms can vary very much and they may often be non-specific , a fact which makes it more difficult to establish a proper diagnosis and to quickly tailor the optimal therapeutic solutions. Surgery is , in the most cases , a comfortable solution , allowing the cases to be permanently healed. Nowadays , cardiac surgery provides all the needed facilities to diagnose cases at an early stage , when diagnosis is quick and accurate. This paper illustrates , by the means of two suggestive cases , how difficult it is to establish a quick positive diagnosis , which is vital for healing this condition with an evolutionary risk frequently worsen by major complications.
