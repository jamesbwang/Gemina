  Federal regulations governing access to levonorgestrel ( LNG) emergency contraception ( EC) have evolved since its introduction in the 1990s. LNG EC was initially available by prescription only , but is now available over-the-counter to consumers of all ages. Nonetheless , consumers seeking EC in their communities may face ongoing barriers to access including low stock and inaccurate information provided by pharmacy staff. We conducted a review of LNG EC secret shopper studies to describe changes in EC access and barriers over time. EC access was compared across all applicable studies , which were published during 2003-2016. When possible , reasons for EC unavailability , helpfulness of pharmacy staff when EC was not in stock , and accuracy of EC information provided by pharmacy staff were described. Overall , access to EC appeared to be improving. However , EC was unavailable during 31 % of encounters. Pharmacy staff attributed this to `` low demand '' ( 30 %) or EC being `` out of stock '' ( 21 %). Personal objections ( 9 %) and store policy ( 10 %) were also cited in studies from earlier years. Inaccurate information provided by pharmacy staff persists regarding federal EC regulations , mechanism of action , and drug administration. Pharmacy staff should remain informed about EC and its regulations in order to reduce remaining access barriers.
