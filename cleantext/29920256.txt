  The growing world population is placing an increasing demand on food production. In addition , abuse and misuse of chemical insecticides has led to the evolution of resistance in insect pests as well as environmental damage. Together , these developments have created a demand for new insecticidal compounds to facilitate global food production. Arachnid venom peptides provide an environmentally-friendly alternative as potential bioinsecticides given their advantages of being fully biodegradable , highly potent , and phyletically selective. However , the use of arachnid venom peptides as bioinsecticides has been questioned due to their presumed lack of oral toxicity. Thus , the aim of this work was to develop screens for oral insecticidal activity. Based on the high susceptibility of dipterans to venom peptides , fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster) and sheep blowflies ( Lucilia cuprina) were selected for screening 56 arachnid venoms. 71.4 % of these venoms caused 50 % or higher mortality in Drosophila , whereas 30.4 % were lethal to blowflies at oral doses of 1 or 30 Î¼g/fly , respectively. We used these assays to compare the oral and injection activity of four well-known spider venom peptides ( Hv1a , Hv1c , Dc1a and Ta1a). Hv1c and Ta1a only showed weak or no oral activity in both species , while Hv1a and Dc1a showed higher oral activity in blowflies than Drosophila. Overall , we have established screens for oral toxicity in two dipteran insects. Our results indicate that oral insecticidal activity is more widespread in arachnid venoms than expected , and that some arachnid venoms and venom peptides exhibit phyletic differences in oral toxicity.
