  Sepsis<disease> is one of the major contributor of morbidity and mortality in pediatric cardiac surgeries. The aim of this study was to compare the predictive efficacy of total leukocyte counts ( TC) , platelet count ( PC) , and procalcitonin ( PCT) for sepsis<disease> in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries who are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. This prospective , single-center study included 300 neonates , infants , and pediatric patients who had undergone various open heart surgeries at our center from September 2014 to November 2015. Overall , the incidence of sepsis<disease> was 14 % in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgeries. TC of postoperative 48 h were significantly lower ( 11889.19 ± 5092.86 vs. 14583.22 ± 6562.96; We may conclude that in Indian pediatric population platelet levels are highly associated with sepsis<disease> as compared to any other hematological parameter. The immediate postoperative level of platelet is the strongest predictor of sepsis<disease> and could be effectively used in the clinical settings.
