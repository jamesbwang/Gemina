  To evaluate patients diagnosed with posterior four-part fracture-dislocations of the proximal humerus , that were surgically treated with osteosynthesis , regarding their clinical and functional outcomes. A prospective observational study of eight patients from the same hospital institution in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo State ( Brazil) , through individual interviews using the UCLA , DASH , and Constant international scores. The active movements included in the scores plus the range of motion of the affected and non-affected limb were measured. The affected shoulder 's radiographs were requested to verify bone conditions and the fixation of the osteosynthesis. The rating of eight patients by the international scores indicated that seven of the eight patients presented good clinical and functional evolution of the affected limb; this represents 87.5 % of the evaluated individuals. Surgical treatment with osteosynthesis performed during the acute period ( < four weeks) leads to good results in most cases.
