  On-site sample preparation is highly desired because it avoids the transportation of large-volume samples and ensures the accuracy of the analytical results. In this work , a portable prototype of tip microextraction device ( TMD) was designed and developed for on-site sample pretreatment. The assembly procedure of TMD is quite simple. Firstly , polymeric ionic liquid ( PIL)- based adsorbent was in-situ prepared in a pipette tip. After that , the tip was connected with a syringe which was driven by a bidirectional motor. The flow rates in adsorption and desorption steps were controlled accurately by the motor. To evaluate the practicability of the developed device , the TMD was used to on-site sample preparation of waters and combined with high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection to measure trace estrogens in water samples. Under the most favorable conditions , the limits of detection ( LODs , S/N = 3) for the target analytes were in the range of 4.9-22 ng/L , with good coefficients of determination. Confirmatory study well evidences that the extraction performance of TMD is comparable to that of the traditional laboratory solid-phase extraction process , but the proposed TMD is more simple and convenient. At the same time , the TMD avoids complicated sampling and transferring steps of large-volume water samples.
