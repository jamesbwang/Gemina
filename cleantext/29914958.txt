  Tribendimidine is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic available in China , which is currently being pursued for US Food and Drug Administration approval for soil-transmitted helminth infections. Pharmacokinetic ( PK) studies with tribendimidine in children , the main target group for treatment programs , have not been conducted to date. In the framework of a dose-ranging study in hookworm infected school-aged children in CÃ´te d'Ivoire , children were either treated with 100 mg , 200 mg , or 400 mg tribendimidine. Dried blood spot samples were collected up to 22 hours after treatment. The active metabolite , deacetylated amidantel ( dADT) and its metabolite acylated dADT ( adADT) were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. PK parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental model and univariate logistic regression was applied using maximal blood concentrations ( C
