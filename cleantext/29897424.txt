  An isotope dilution selective and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-ESI-MS/MS) method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ) and ramipril in human plasma through a new concept of periodical polarity switching. Extraction of HCTZ , ramipril and their deuterated analogs as internal standards ( ISs) was carried out from 150 μL of human plasma by solid-phase extraction method. Chromatographic separation of analytes was performed on Hypurity C18 ( 150 mm × 4.6 mm , 5 μ) column under gradient conditions with methanol: 0.2 % ( v/v) formic acid in water as the mobile phase. The method was validated over a concentration range of 0.750-300 ng/mL for HCTZ and 0.125-80.0 ng/mL for ramipril. The mean extraction recovery for analytes and ISs were > ( 86.0 %) , consistent across all four QC levels. The challenges to evaluate matrix effect and continuous reproducibility of method during long analytical run was studied and resolved. Processed samples , freeze-thaw , long-term and whole blood stability were evaluated for both the analytes. The method was applied to support a bioequivalence study of 25 mg of HCTZ and 5 mg of ramipril tablet formulation in nine healthy Indian subjects. Assay reproducibility was demonstrated by reanalysis of 42 incurred samples.
