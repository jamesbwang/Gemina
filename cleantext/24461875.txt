  Growing evidence demonstrates that L-arginine/NO/cGMP/ K Rats were pretreated intraplantarly ( IPL) or intracerebroventricularly ( ICV) with L-arginine ( the NO precursor) , l-NAME ( an NO synthase inhibitor) , SNAP ( an NO donor) , methylene blue ( a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) , glibenclamide ( the blocker of K Local ipsilateral ( 20 and 40 μg , IPL) but not contralateral and ICV ( 4 and 8 μg) administration of thymoquinone caused a dose-dependent and significant antinociception in both early and late phases of the formalin test. Pretreatment of rats with L-arginine ( 100 μg , IPL or ICV) and SNAP ( 200 μg , IPL or ICV) increased while l-NAME ( 100 μg , IPL or 1 μg , ICV) and methylene blue ( 400 μg , IPL or ICV) decreased the antinociceptive effects of thymoquinone in the formalin test. The administration of TEA ( IPL or ICV) did not modify but glibenclamide ( 50 μg , IPL or ICV) significantly abolished the peripheral and central antinociceptive effects of thymoquinone in both phases of the formalin test. The results of the present study indicate that L-arginine/NO/cGMP/ K
