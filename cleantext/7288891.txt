  The investigation of genetic clusters in natural populations is an ubiquitous problem in a range of fields relying on the analysis of genetic data , such as molecular ecology , conservation biology and microbiology. Typically , genetic clusters are defined as distinct panmictic populations , or parental groups in the context of hybridisation. Two types of methods have been developed for identifying such clusters: model-based methods , which are usually computer-intensive but yield results which can be interpreted in the light of an explicit population genetic model , and geometric approaches , which are less interpretable but remarkably faster.Here , we introduce
