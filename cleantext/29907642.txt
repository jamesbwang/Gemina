  Telomerase and its core component , telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT) , are critical for stem cell compartment integrity. Normal adult stem cells have the longest telomeres in a given tissue , a property mediated by high hTERT expression and high telomerase enzymatic activity. In contrast , cancer stem cells ( CSCs) have short telomeres despite high expression of hTERT , indicating that the role of hTERT in CSCs is not limited to telomere elongation and/or maintenance. The function of hTERT in CSCs remains poorly understood. Here , we knocked down hTERT expression in CSCs and observed a morphological shift to a more epithelial phenotype , suggesting a role for hTERT in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) of CSCs. Therefore , in this study , we systematically explored the relationship between hTERT and EMT and identified a reciprocal , bi-directional feedback loop between hTERT and EMT in CSCs. We found that hTERT expression is mutually exclusive to the mesenchymal phenotype and that , reciprocally , loss of the mesenchymal phenotype represses hTERT expression. We also showed that hTERT plays a critical role in the expression of key CSC markers and nuclear Î²-catenin localization , increases the percentage of cells with side-population properties , and upregulates the CD133 expression. hTERT also promotes chemoresistance properties , tumorsphere formation and other important functional CSC properties. Subsequently , hTERT knockdown leads to the loss of the above advantages , indicating a loss of CSC properties. Our findings suggest that targeting hTERT might improve CSCs elimination by transitioning them from the aggressive mesenchymal state to a more steady epithelial state , thereby preventing cancer progression.
