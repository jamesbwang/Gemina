  To evaluate the effect of a single preoperative dose of 125 mg methylprednisolone ( MP) on glycemic homeostasis early after fast-track total hip and knee arthroplasty. One-hundred thirty-four patients undergoing elective unilateral total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty were randomized ( 1:1) to preoperative intravenous MP 125 mg ( group MP) or isotonic saline intravenous ( group C). All procedures were performed under spinal anesthesia , using a standardized multimodal analgesic regime. The primary outcome was the change in plasma glucose 2 hours postoperatively , and secondary outcomes included plasma C-peptide concentrations , homeostatic model assessment ( HOMA) , HOMA-IR ( insulin resistance) , and HOMA-B ( β-cell function). Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and 2 , 6 ( nonfasting) , 24 , and 48 hours after surgery with complete samples from 122 patients ( group MP = 62 , group C = 60) for analyses. MP patients had increased plasma glucose levels at 2 hours ( adjusted mean ( 95 % CI) , 7.4 mmol · L ( 7.2-7.5) vs 6.0 mmol · L ( 5.9-6.2); P = .023) and 6 hours ( 13.9 mmol · L ( 13.3-14.5) vs 8.4 mmol · L ( 7.8-9.0); P < .001) , and in plasma C-peptide 24 hours postoperatively ( 1675 pmol · L ( 1573-1778) vs 1248 pmol · L ( 1145-1351); P < .001). An impaired insulin response was also observed in group MP as reflected by HOMA-B ( P < .001). Additionally , HOMA-IR increased 24 hours postoperatively in group MP compared to group C ( P < .001). Parameters were normalized 48 hours postoperatively. Preoperative administration of MP 125 mg resulted in a transient postoperative increase in plasma glucose and insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion in response to hyperglycemia.
