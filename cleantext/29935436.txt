  The capacity of B lymphocytes to produce specific antibodies , particularly broadly neutralizing antibodies that provide immunity to viral pathogens has positioned them as valuable therapeutic targets for immunomodulation. To become competent as antibody secreting cells , B cells undergo a series of activation steps , which are triggered by the recognition of antigens frequently displayed on the surface of other presenting cells. Such antigens elicit the formation of an immune synapse ( IS) , where local cytoskeleton rearrangements coupled to mechanical forces and membrane trafficking orchestrate the extraction and processing of antigens in B cells. In this review , we discuss the molecular mechanisms that regulate polarized membrane trafficking and mechanical properties of the immune synapse , as well as the potential extracellular cues from the environment , which may impact the ability of B cells to sense and acquire antigens at the immune synapse. An integrated view of the diverse cellular mechanisms that shape the immune synapse will provide a better understanding on how B cells are efficiently activated.
