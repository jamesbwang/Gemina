  The labile iron pool ( LIP) is a pool of chelatable and redox-active iron , not only essential for a wide variety of metabolic process , but also as a catalyst in the Fenton reaction , causing the release of hazardous reactive oxygen species ( ROS) with potential for inducing oxidative stress and cell damage. The cellular LIP represents the entirety of every heterogenous sub-pool of iron , not only present in the cytosol , but also in mitochondria , lysosomes and the nucleus , which have all been detected and characterized by various fluorescent methods. Accumulated evidence indicates that alterations in the intracellular LIP can substantially contribute to a variety of injurious processes and initiate pathological development. Herein , we present our understanding of the role of the cellular LIP. To fully review the LIP , firstly , the significance of cellular labile iron in different subcellular compartments is presented. And then , the trafficking processes of cellular labile iron between/in cytosol , mitochondria and lysosomes are discussed in detail. Then , the recent progress in uncovering and assessing the cellular LIP by fluorescent methods have been noted. Overall , this summary may help to comprehensively envision the important physiological and pathological roles of the LIP and shed light on profiling the LIP in a real-time and nondestructive manner with fluorescent methods. Undoubtedly , with the advent and development of iron biology , a better understanding of iron , especially the LIP , may also enhance treatments for iron-related diseases.
