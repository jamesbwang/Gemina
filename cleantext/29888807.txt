  Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLD) has the highest incidence following intestinal transplantation ( ITx). Our center has seen a recent increase in PTLD. Our aim was to review a single-center PTLD experience with a focus on clinical characteristics and outcomes. We completed a retrospective review of biopsy-proven PTLD cases using a prospectively maintained database of 115 ITx recipients transplanted between 1991 and 2014. Nineteen ( 17 %) ITx recipients developed 25 PTLD cases during a median follow-up time of 6.4 ( 1.6-14.6) years. The incidence of early PTLD was 6 % ( n = 7). There was a trend toward increased risk of PTLD in children compared with adults ( P = .11) and a significantly increased risk of PTLD in re-ITx compared with primary ITx recipients ( P = .03). Most PTLD cases were diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 ( n = 14). All early PTLD cases were EBV + on in situ hybridization. Overall graft and patient survival are 68 % and 74 % , respectively. Second episodes of PTLD were diagnosed in 43 % of surviving pediatric patients. Our program has a low incidence of early PTLD with overall excellent graft and patient survival following diagnosis. However , we have also seen a rising incidence of late PTLD. The cause of the increase is unknown as no major changes in immunosuppression protocols have occurred since 1999.
