  Chronic neuroinflammation is a characteristic of Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Previous investigations have shown that Parkin gene mutations are related to the early-onset recessive form of PD and isolated juvenile-onset PD. Further , Parkin plays important roles in mitochondrial quality control and cytokine-induced cell death. However , whether Parkin regulates other cellular events is still largely unknown. In this study , we performed overexpression and knockout experiments , and found that Parkin negatively regulates antiviral immune responses against RNA and DNA viruses. Mechanistically , we show that Parkin interacts with tumor necrosis<symptom> factor receptor-associated factor 3 ( TRAF3) to regulate stability of TRAF3 protein by promoting K48-linked ubiquitination. Our findings suggest that Parkin plays a novel role in innate immune signaling by targeting TRAF3 for degradation , and maintaining the balance<symptom> of innate antiviral immunity.
