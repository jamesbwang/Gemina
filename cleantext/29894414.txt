  Posttransplant liver steatosis occurs frequently and can affect patient outcome. Our aim was to clarify the risk factors for steatosis or steatohepatitis after living donor liver transplantation ( LT) through a retrospective examination of recent 100 living donor LT recipients and their liver donors. Liver biopsy was performed at 1-year after LT and each year , thereafter , or as needed due to abnormal liver enzyme levels , with a median follow-up of 4 ( 2 ~ 10) years. Liver steatosis ( ≥ 5 %) was identified in 33 cases , with steatohepatitis identified in 9 of 33 patients with liver steatosis. Recipients with liver steatosis were younger than those without steatosis ( 53.4 ± 9.5 years versus 57.6 ± 9.9 years , respectively; p = 0.045). Of note , the prevalence of steatosis was significantly higher among LT recipients who received a graft from a donor with steatosis than without ( 60 % versus 23 % , respectively; p = 0.001). Donor steatosis was also associated with steatohepatitis in recipients after LT ( steatohepatitis: simple steatosis; 88 %: 50 %). On multivariate analysis , younger recipient age ( p = 0.023) and donor steatosis ( p = 0.005) were independent risk factors of liver steatosis after LT. Among the 33 recipients in our study group , 26 were assessed by serial liver biopsies , with 6 showing progression of the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score ( NAS). An increase in body<symptom> weight was predictive of steatosis progression after LT ( p = 0.005). Age and donor steatosis influence the risk of liver steatosis and steatohepatitis in recipients after LT. The clinical course of steatosis is relatively benign , with only 19 % developing NAS and 7.6 % significant
