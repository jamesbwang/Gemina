  The promise of gene therapy for the treatment of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> has yet to be fully clinically realized despite years of effort toward correcting the underlying genetic defect in the cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR). mRNA therapy via nanoparticle delivery represents a powerful technology for the transfer of genetic material to cells with large , widespread populations , such as airway epithelia. We deployed a clinically relevant lipid-based nanoparticle ( LNP) for packaging and delivery of large chemically modified CFTR mRNA ( cmCFTR) to patient-derived bronchial epithelial cells , resulting in an increase in membrane-localized CFTR and rescue of its primary function as a chloride channel. Furthermore , nasal application of LNP-cmCFTR restored CFTR-mediated chloride secretion to conductive airway epithelia in CFTR knockout mice for at least 14 days. On day 3 post-transfection , CFTR activity peaked , recovering up to 55 % of the net chloride efflux characteristic of healthy mice. This magnitude of response is superior to liposomal CFTR DNA delivery and is comparable with outcomes observed in the currently approved drug ivacaftor. LNP-cmRNA-based systems represent a powerful platform technology for correction of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> and other monogenic disorders.
