  AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) functions as a cellular energy sensor by monitoring the cellular AMP: ATP ratio and plays a central role in cellular and whole-body energy homeostasis. Recent studies have suggested that AMPK also contribute to cell cycle regulation , but its role in this field remains almost elusive. In the present study , we report that AMPKÎ±1 was transiently activated during G
