  Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 ( SGLT-2) inhibitor that reduces blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) by promoting glycosuria via inhibiting urinary glucose reabsorption. In addition to improving blood glucose control , treatment with dapagliflozin results in glucose-induced osmotic diuresis , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> lowering. Previous trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors showed reductions in cardiovascular ( CV) events , including CV death and hospitalization for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and ischemic events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD). DECLARE-TIMI 58 ( NCT01730534) is a phase 3b randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the CV safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin that has completed randomization of 17,160 patients with T2DM and a history of either established ASCVD ( n = 6,971) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD ( n = 10,189). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo. The primary safety outcome is the time to the first event of the composite of CV death , myocardial infarction , or ischemic stroke ( major adverse cardiovascular events; MACEs). The co-primary efficacy outcomes are the composite of CV death , myocardial infarction , or ischemic stroke and the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. This event-driven trial will continue until at least 1,390 subjects have a MACE outcome , thereby providing > 99 % power to test for the primary outcome of safety of dapagliflozin measured by rejecting the hypothesis that the upper bound of the CI > 1.3 for the primary outcome of MACE , as well as 85 % power to detect a 15 % relative risk reduction in MACE and an estimated 87 % power to detect a 20 % reduction in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> at a 1-sided Î± level of .0231. The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial is testing the hypotheses that dapagliflozin is safe ( does not increase) and may reduce the occurrence of major CV events. DECLARE-TIMI 58 is the largest study to address this question with an SGLT-2 inhibitor in patients with T2DM and with established CV disease and without CV disease but with multiple risk factors.
