  Pixantrone is a first-in-class aza-anthracenedione approved as monotherapy for treatment of relapsed or refractory aggressive diffuse B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL) , a patient group which is notoriously difficult to treat. It has a unique chemical structure and pharmacologic properties distinguishing it from anthracyclines and anthracenediones. Areas covered: The chemical structure and mode of action of pixantrone versus doxorubicin and mitoxantrone; preclinical evidence for pixantrone 's therapeutic effect and cardiac tolerability; efficacy and safety of pixantrone in clinical trials; ongoing and completed trials of pixantrone alone or as combination therapy; and the risk of cardiotoxicity of pixantrone versus doxorubicin and mitoxantrone. Expert commentary: Currently , pixantrone is the only approved therapy for multiply relapsed or refractory NHL , an area with few available effective treatment options. Pixantrone is currently being investigated as combination therapy with other drugs including several targeted therapies , with the ultimate goal of improved survival in heavily pretreated patients. In order for pixantrone to be acknowledged in the treatment of aggressive NHL , the perception of pixantrone as an anthracycline-like agent that has anthracycline-like activity and cardiotoxicity needs to be changed. Further data from ongoing clinical trials will help in confirming pixantrone as an effective and safe option.
