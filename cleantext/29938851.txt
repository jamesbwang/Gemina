  The proteomic analysis of complex body fluids by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) analysis requires the selection of suitable sample preparation techniques and optimal parameter settings in data analysis software packages to obtain reliable results. Proteomic analysis of follicular fluid , as a representative of a complex body fluid similar to serum or plasma , is difficult as it contains a vast amount of high abundant proteins and a variety of proteins with different concentrations. However , the accessibility of this complex body fluid for LC-MS/MS analysis is an opportunity to gain insights into the status , the composition of fertility-relevant proteins including immunological factors or for the discovery of new diagnostic and prognostic markers for , for example , the treatment of infertility<symptom>. In this study , we compared different sample preparation methods ( FASP , eFASP and in-solution digestion) and three different data analysis software packages ( Proteome Discoverer with SEQUEST , Mascot and MaxQuant with Andromeda) combined with semi- and full-tryptic databank search options to obtain a maximum coverage of the follicular fluid proteome. We found that the most comprehensive proteome coverage is achieved by the eFASP sample preparation method using SDS in the initial denaturing step and the SEQUEST-based semi-tryptic data analysis. In conclusion , we have developed a fractionation-free methodical workflow for in depth LC-MS/MS-based analysis for the standardized investigation of human follicle fluid as an important representative of a complex body fluid. Taken together , we were able to identify a total of 1392 proteins in follicular fluid.
