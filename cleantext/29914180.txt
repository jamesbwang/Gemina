  The system architecture for an adaptive multiple input multiple output ( MIMO) radar-communication transceiver is proposed. A waveform design approach for communication data embedding into MIMO radar pulse using M-ary position phase shift keying ( MPPSK) waveforms is introduced. A waveform optimization algorithm for the adaptive system is presented. The algorithm aims to improve the target detection performance by maximizing the relative entropy ( RE) between the distributions under existence and absence of the target , and minimizing the mutual information ( MI) between the current received signals and the estimated signals in the next time instant. The proposed system adapts its MPPSK modulated inter-pulse duration to suit the time-varying environment. With subsequent iterations of the algorithm , simulation results show an improvement in target impulse response ( TIR) estimation and target detection probability. Meanwhile , the system is able to transmit data of several Mbps with low symbol error rates.
