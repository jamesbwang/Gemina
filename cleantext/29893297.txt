  Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disorder associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. To evaluate the utility of ( This was a randomized , double-blind pilot study conducted in a tertiary care center. Baseline standardized uptake value score was estimated by A total of 16 patients were randomized to different treatment groups. Significant increase in mean SUVmax was observed in the ascending aorta in psoriasis patients as compared to historical controls ( 2.03 ± 0.53 vs 1.51 ± 0.36 , P < 0.03). There was no difference in composite standardized uptake value score after 12 weeks of treatment in any of the treatment groups ( P = 0.82) , although an improvement in Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index score in the methotrexate arm was observed. No correlation was found between mean SUVmax and Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index scores in various aortic segments ( r = 0.3-0.7). Small sample size , short follow-up , historical controls , exclusion of patients with comorbid conditions and lack of surrogate markers of systemic inflammation<symptom>. None
