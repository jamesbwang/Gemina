  Gastric duplication cysts<symptom> are rare congenital anomalies , and malignant transformation has only been reported in 11 cases. A healthy 57-year-old woman presented with abdominal<symptom> discomfort<symptom> , and computed tomography revealed a 5.8 × 6.6 × 8.2 cm mass at the gastric fundus. On endoscopic ultrasound , the mass was mostly hypoechoic with anechoic cystic cavities arising from the submucosal layer. Fine-needle aspiration was suspicious for adenocarcinoma. Surgical pathology confirmed high-grade adenocarcinoma , clear cell cytology arising from a foregut duplication cyst<symptom>. Endoscopic ultrasound is underutilized in the evaluation duplication cysts<symptom> and should be considered in routine workup.
