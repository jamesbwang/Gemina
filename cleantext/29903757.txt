  Accumulating clinical evidence implicates a suppressive effect on hematopoiesis in myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> patients with iron overload. However , how iron overload influences hematopoiesis in myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> remains unknown. Here , the RUNX1S291fs-transduced bone<disease> marrow mononuclear cells were yielded and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice together with radioprotective bone<disease> marrow cells to generate myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> mice. Eight weeks post transplantation , the recipient mice were administered intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml iron dextran at a concentration of 25mg/ml once every other day for 8 times to establish iron overload model. At the present study , we show that iron overload impairs the frequency and colony-forming capacity of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells , especially in erythroid , in myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> mice , which at least in part , due to growth differentiation factor 11 induced reactive oxygen species and shortening survival of myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> mice. Given that we are the first to construct iron overload model in myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> mice , we hope this model will be helpful for further exploring the influence and mechanism of iron overload on myelodysplastic
