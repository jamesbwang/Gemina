  The potential impact of the 2016 United States Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF) guidelines on statins for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD) warrants further analysis. We studied participants from MESA ( Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) aged 40 to 75 years and not on statins. We compared statin eligibility at baseline ( 2000-2002) and over follow-up between USPSTF and the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA) guidelines. Coronary artery calcium ( CAC) was measured at baseline. Absolute ASCVD event rates were calculated according to eligibility categories for each guideline. Among 4962 MESA participants ( aged 59.3 Â± 8.8 years , 47.2 % female) , compared with ACC/AHA guidelines , baseline statin eligibility by USPSTF was significantly lower ( 34.4 % versus 49.1 %) and increased less over time ( 39.1 % versus 59.1 %) at examination 5 ( years 2010-2012)). Compared with ACC/AHA , participants eligible by USPSTF were less likely to have zero CAC at baseline ( 36.6 % versus 41.2 %) and had higher rates of hard ASCVD events per 1000 person-years ( 11.6 ( 95 % confidence interval , 10.2-13.3) versus 10.0 ( 8.9-11.3)). The hard ASCVD event rate in those eligible by ACC/AHA but not USPSTF was 6.5 ( 4.9-8.5) events per 1000 person-years , with the rate varying significantly according to baseline CAC ( 4.2 ( 2.7-6.7) events in those with CAC = 0 , 12.8 ( 8.3-19.9) events in those with CAC > 100). In MESA , compared with ACC/AHA , the USPSTF statin guidelines resulted in a 15 % absolute decrease in eligibility. Participants with discordant eligibility had ASCVD rates that varied significantly according to baseline CAC , suggesting CAC could aid clinical decision making for statins in these individuals.
