  Dendritic cell ( DC) trafficking from lung to the draining mediastinal lymph nodes ( MLNs) is a key step for initiation of T cell responses in allergic asthma. In the present study , we investigate the role of DC-mediated airway inflammation<symptom> after inhibition of p21-activated kinase-1 ( PAK1) , an effector of Rac and Cdc42 small GTPases , in the allergen-induced mouse models of asthma. Systemic administration of PAK1 specific inhibitor IPA-3 significantly attenuates not only the airway inflammation<symptom> but also the airway hyperresponsiveness in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced asthma. Specifically , intratracheal administration of low dosage of IPA-3 consistently decreases not only the airway inflammation<symptom> but also the DC trafficking from lung to the MLNs. Importantly , intratracheal instillation of IPA-3-treated and ovalbumin-pulsed DCs behaves largely the same as that of either Rac inhibitor-treated and ovalbumin-pulsed DCs or Cdc42 inhibitor-treated and ovalbumin-pulsed DCs in attenuation of the airway inflammation<symptom> in ovalbumin-challenged mice. Mechanistically , PAK1 is not involved in the maturation , apoptosis , antigen uptake , and T cell activation of cultured DCs , but PAK1 dose lie on the downstream of Rac and Cdc42 to regulate the DC migration toward the chemokine C-C motif chemokine ligand 19. Taken together , this study demonstrates that inhibition of PAK1 attenuates the cardinal features of asthma through suppressing the DC trafficking from lung to the MLN , and that interfere with DC trafficking by a PAK1 inhibitor thus holds great promise for the therapeutic intervention of allergic diseases.
