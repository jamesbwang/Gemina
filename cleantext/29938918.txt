  The irradiation of concentrated feeds of carbohydrates in alcoholic solution by high-frequency ultrasound ( 550 kHz) induces the formation of alkylpolyglycosides ( APGs). This work is distinct from previous reports in that it does not involve any ( bio) catalyst or activating agent , it takes place at only 40 Â°C , thus avoiding degradation of carbohydrates , and it selectively yields APGs with a degree of polymerization in a window of 2-7 , an important limitation of the popular Fischer glycosylation. This ultrasound-based technology proved successful with a range of different valuable carbohydrates and alkyl alcohols. The elucidation of the structure of all the produced glycosides strongly suggests that 1,6-anhydrosugars formed in situ are key intermediate species.
