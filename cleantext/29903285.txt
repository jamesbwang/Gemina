  To study the edible safety of recombinant human lactoferrin ( rh LF) expressed from transgenic cow mammary gland bioreactor. According to the food additive safety toxicology evaluation procedures and method , acute oral toxicity in rats and 90 day subchronic toxicity test in mice were done to evaluate the edible safety of rh LF. Acute oral toxicity test indicated that rh LF was no toxic effect during the observation period , mouse acute oral LD50 of recombinant human lactoferrin was greater than 20 000 mg/kg. 90 days feeding test indicated that there was no-observedadverse-effect-level after givening 300 times rh LF recommended dose of animals body , toxicological parameters NOAEL was 10. 00 g/ ( kg Â· d). According to the acute toxic dose graduation standard , rh LF was nonpoisonous. Rh LF was no-observedadverse-effect-level and no subchronic toxicity after givening 300 times rh LF recommended dose of animals body. According to the result , rh LF was no potential food safety risk.
