  Powdery mildew ( PM , caused by Golovinomyces orontii) is one of the major diseases on sunflower that causes severe yield losses in the tropics. Sources of resistance to PM are reported in an exotic accession and some wild Helianthus species. The present study aims at quantitative proteomic analysis of susceptible , resistant and immune genotypes of sunflower in response to PM infection at 3 , 7 , 10 days post infection. The majority of differentially expressed proteins in the resistant genotype belonged to oxidative stress ( catalase , ATP-sulfurylase and formate dehydrogenase) , defense ( HSP-70 , heat shock<symptom> transcription factors) and photosynthesis ( LHCB3). In case of immune genotype , 50 % of proteins were related to photosynthesis , which play a key role in plant immunity. Whereas , a few similar proteins were also expressed in the susceptible genotype , but in their reduced abundance besides being inadequate in timing of expression probably leading to its susceptibility to PM. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that carbon metabolism ( 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase , pyruvate dehydrogenase , glutamine synthetase) , photosynthesis and plant pathogen protein pathways are key pathways governing the resistance. The transcriptional expression of 8 of 9 differentially expressed proteins were in agreement with the expression of proteins at the corresponding time. The present study has provided information on the key proteins that are upregulated in resistant and immune genotypes which restrict the disease progression and constitutes the first quantitative preoteomic data of sunflower-PM infection process.
