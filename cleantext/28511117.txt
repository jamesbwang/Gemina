  The therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases still represent a vast research field because of the lack of targeted , effective and resolutive treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. The use of stem cell-based therapy is an alternative approach that could lead to the replacement of damaged neuronal tissue. For this purpose , adult mesenchymal stem cells ( MSC) , including periodontal ligament stem cells ( PDLSCs) , could be very useful for their differentiation capacity , easy isolation and the ability to perform an autologous implant. The aim of this work was to test whether the Moringin ( 4- ( Î±-L-rhamnosyloxy) benzyl isothiocyanate; GMG-ITC) , an isothiocyanate extracted from Moringa oleifera seeds , was able to induce PDLSCs toward neural progenitor differentiation. Next-generation transcriptomics sequencing showed that moringin treatment increased the expression of genes involved in neuron cortical development and in particular in neuron belonging to upper and deep cortical layers. Moreover , moringin treatment upregulated genes involved in osteogenesis and adipogenesis although with a lower fold change compared to upregulated genes involved in neuronal differentiation. Finally , moringin did not induce the expression of oncogenes resulting in a safe treatment.
