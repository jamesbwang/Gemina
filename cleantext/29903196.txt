  To verify the mutagenicity of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate ( 2-EHA) using in vivo Pig-a gene mutation assay integrated system. The SPF-grade male SD rats ( n = 30) were randomized to six treatment groups , i. e. 4 treatment groups ( 100 , 200 , 400 and 800 mg/kg) , a control group ( vegetable oil) and a positive groups ( Nethyl-N-nitrosourea , 10 mg/kg). All treatments were administrated by gavage for continuous 28 days. Tail vein blood specimens for Pig-a gene mutation assay were collected on days 0 , 15 and 29. The number of mutant erythrocytes and reticulocytes was acquired by flow cytometer. Tail vein blood for comet assay was collected at 6 h after the final administration , followed by the bone<disease> marrow micronucleus test after animal sacrifice. Later in the study , signs of mild poisoning<disease> were observed in the animals treated with 400 and 800 mg/kg BW 2-EHA. There was no significant difference among the groups in mutant cell frequency of erythrocytes and reticulocytes at all 3 timepoint in Piga gene mutation assay , and no significant difference among the groups in tail length and Olive tail moment in comet assay. There was likewise no significant difference among groups in micronucleus test. In present experiment conditions , 2-EHA did not show genotoxicity in Pig-a gene mutation assay , comet assay and micronucleus test , which indicated that 2-EHA probably is not mutagenic in vivo.
