  Sensitized upconversion is explored in three metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) constructed from the anthracene dicarboxylate ( ADC) derivatives and zirconium nodes , 9,10-ADC ( 9,10-MOF) , 2,6-ADC ( 2,6-MOF) and 1,4-ADC ( 1,4-MOF). Selective excitation of surface-bound Pd ( ii) mesoporphyrin IX ( PdMP) gives rise to delayed fluorescence ( τ = 370 ± 30 ns) from anthracene in the 9,10-MOF. The overall upconversion efficiency of the Pd @ 9,10-MOF is 0.46 ± 0.05 % with a threshold intensity of 104 ± 26 mW cm-2.
