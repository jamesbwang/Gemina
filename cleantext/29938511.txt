  The proteomes of Russell 's viper venom ( RVV) from Burdwan ( RVV B) and Nadia ( RVV N) , the two districts of West Bengal , eastern India ( EI) , were investigated by gel-filtration chromatography ( GFC) followed by tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments of the fractions. A total of 73 and 69 proteins belonging to 15 snake venom protein families were identified in RVV B and RVV N , respectively , by MS/MS search against Viperidae ( taxid 8689) protein entries of the nonredundant NCBI database. The minor differences in venom composition of both the EI RV were established unequivocally by their biochemical and pharmacological properties and by SDS-PAGE , gel filtration chromatography , and LC-MS/MS analyses. The composition of EI RVVs was well correlated with published reports on the pathophysiology of RV-envenomed patients from this part of the country. Venom-antivenom cross-reactivity determined by ELISA , Western blotting , and antivenomics approaches demonstrated poor recognition of low molecular mass ( < 20 kDa) RVV proteins by commercial polyvalent antivenoms , which was substantiated by neutralization of RVV enzymes by antivenom.
