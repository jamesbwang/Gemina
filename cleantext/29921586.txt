  Regulation of autophagy by proteolytically-cleaved fragments of heparan sulfate proteoglycans is a novel and current research focus in tumor biology. Endorepellin , is the C-terminal angiostatic fragment of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan and , induces autophagy in endothelial cells. To further investigate this property , we used NanoString , a digital PCR platform for measuring pre-defined transcripts in biological samples to analyze a custom subset of 95 autophagy-related genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with ultrapure human recombinant endorepellin. We discovered an endorepellin-evoked pro-autophagic and pro-mitophagic gene expression signature , which included two coordinately up-regulated mitochondrial-associated genes encoding the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase Parkin and the tumor suppressor mitostatin. Induction of both proteins required the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2). Further , we discovered that endorepellin evoked mitochondrial depolarization in endothelial cells via a specific interaction between its two proximal LG1/2 domains and VEGFR2. We also found that following loss of membrane potential , mitostatin and parkin interact and that mitostatin associates with the established parkin receptor mitofusin-2. In conclusion , we have identified a critical role for endorepellin in remodeling the autophagic transcriptome and influencing mitochondrial homeostasis.
