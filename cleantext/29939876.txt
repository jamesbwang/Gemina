  Systemic melanoma therapies have the potential to affect basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cuSCC) development. In this study , we aim to compare the incidence of BCC and cuSCC in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with antiprogrammed cell death-1 ( anti-PD1) , BRAF inhibitor ( BRAFi) monotherapy or dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy ( CombiDT) with a group of control patients having similar risk factors. We reviewed the records of melanoma patients on anti-PD1 , BRAFi , or CombiDT , and patients from the High-Risk Melanoma Clinic , Westmead Hospital. We also performed an immunohistochemical analysis of BCCs under anti-PD1 compared with controls using PD1 , PD-L1 , CD3 , CD8 , and CD20 stains. For the results , in all , 340 patients were included; 82 on anti-PD1 , 134 on BRAFi , 69 on CombiDT , and 55 controls. BRAFi had the highest incidence of BCC ( 12.7 %) , followed by CombiDT ( 10.1 %) and anti-PD1 ( 2.4 %). The incidence of BCC was significantly lower in patients on anti-PD1 ( 2.4 % vs. 19.4 %; P < 0.001) compared with controls. Patients on anti-PD1 were 8.54 times less likely to develop BCC than the controls ( hazard ratio , 0.117 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.026-0.526) , P = 0.005). BRAFi and CombiDT showed no significant differences in BCC incidence compared with controls. BRAFi had the highest cuSCC incidence ( 23.9 %) , followed by anti-PD1 ( 7.3 %) and CombiDT ( 2.9 %). The incidence of cuSCC was significantly higher in patients on BRAFi ( 23.9 % vs. 3.5 %; P < 0.001) compared with controls , but anti-PD1 and CombiDT showed no differences in cuSCC incidence compared with controls. Immunohistochemistry analysis of 10 BCC from under anti-PD1 and 8 BCC from controls patients showed that while all BCC had negative PD-L1 staining , the percentage of PD1 staining in anti-PD1 group is significantly lower than that of the control group ( independent t test , 8 % vs. 26 %; P < 0.001). In conclusion , our study suggests that anti-PD1 therapy decreases the incidence of BCC , as a result of the PD1/PD-L 1 blockade. Future studies investigating the role of anti-PD1 in suppressing or treating BCC may be warranted.
