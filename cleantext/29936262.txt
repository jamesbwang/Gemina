  Previous studies have shown that miR-200a is markedly deregulated in various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , Multiple Sclerosis ( MS) and PD. Furthermore , studies have shown the key role of miR-200a on expression of SIRT1 and apoptosis. Therefore , we hypothesized that miR-200a/ SIRT1 axis should have a crucial role in apoptosis of DA neurons. In this study , human SH-SY5Y cells were treated with MPP + and expression of miR-200a , SIRT1 and its target genes were assessed. Our results confirmed that expression of miR-200a significantly up-regulated during treating of human SH-SY5Y cells with MPP
