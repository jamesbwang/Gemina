  Distinct chromatin organization features , such as centromeres and heterochromatin domains , are inherited epigenetically. However , the mechanisms that modulate the accuracy of epigenetic inheritance , especially at the individual nucleosome level , are not well understood. Here , using ChIP and next-generation sequencing ( ChIP-Seq) , we characterized Ccp1 , a homolog of the histone chaperone Vps75 in budding yeast that functions in centromere chromatin duplication and heterochromatin maintenance in fission yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe). We show that Ccp1 is enriched at the central core regions of the centromeres. Of note , among all histone chaperones characterized , deletion of the
