  To investigate the degree to which lung ventilation and gas exchange are regionally correlated , using the emerging technology of hyperpolarized ( HP)- Hyperpolarized- The correlation of ventilation and RBC transfer was ρ = 0.39 ± 0.15 in healthy volunteers. For the RT patients , this correlation was ρ = 0.53 ± 0.02 before treatment and ρ = 0.39 ± 0.07 after treatment; for the emphysema patient it was ρ = 0.24. Comparing functional ROIs , ventilation and RBC transfer demonstrated poor spatial agreement: Dice similarity coefficient = 0.50 ± 0.07 and 0.26 ± 0.12 for the highest-33 %- and highest-10 %- function ROIs in healthy volunteers , and in RT patients ( before treatment) these were 0.58 ± 0.04 and 0.40 ± 0.04. The average magnitude of the differences between RBC- and ventilation-derived functional effective uniform dose , fV20Gy , fV10Gy , and fV5Gy were 1.5 ± 1.4 Gy , 4.1 % ± 3.8 % , 5.0 % ± 3.8 % , and 5.3 % ± 3.9 % , respectively. Ventilation may not be an effective surrogate for true regional lung function for all patients.
