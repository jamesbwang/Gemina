  Wild-type transthyretin ( ATTRwt) cardiac amyloidosis has emerged as an important cause of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in the elderly. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) commonly affects older adults with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and is associated with reduced survival , but its role in ATTRwt is unclear. We sought to explore the clinical impact of AF in ATTRwt. Patients with biopsy-proven ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis ( n = 146) were retrospectively identified , and clinical , echocardiographic , and biochemical data were collected. Patients were classified as AF or non-AF and followed for survival for a median of 41.4 ± 27.1 months. Means testing , univariable , and multivariable regression models were employed. A systematic review was performed. AF was observed in 70 % ( n = 102). Mean age was similar ( AF , 75 ± 6 vs. non-AF , 74 ± 5 years , P = 0.22). Anticoagulant treatment of patients with AF was as follows: 78 % warfarin , 17 % novel anticoagulant , and 6 % no anticoagulation. Amiodarone was prescribed to 24 %. There were no differences in left ventricular ejection fraction ( P = 0.09) or left atrial volume ( P = 0.87); however , mean diastolic dysfunction grade was higher in AF ( mean 2.7 ± 0.5 vs. 2.4 ± 0.5 , P = 0.01). While creatinine ( P = 0.52) and B-type natriuretic peptide ( P = 0.48) were similar , patients with AF had lower serum transthyretin concentrations ( 221 ± 51 vs. 250 ± 52 μg/mL , P < 0.01). Survival between groups was similar ( P = 0.46). These data provide an evidence basis for clinical management and demonstrate that AF in ATTRwt does not negatively impact survival. Further analysis of the relationship between transthyretin concentration and AF development is warranted.
