  A 72-year-old woman with symptomatic and drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA). She had a history of a total right lung excision. Her chest X-ray and computed tomography ( CT) revealed a severely sight-sided dislocation of the heart. Thus , the procedure was carefully performed under guidance of a CT , intracardiac echogram , atriography , and 3D mapping system. Finally , the AF was successfully treated by RFCA without any complications.
