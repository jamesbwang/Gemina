  Background Headache<symptom> is disabling and prevalent in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Therapeutic lumbar punctures may be considered to manage headache<symptom> This study evaluated the acute effect of lumbar punctures on headache<symptom> severity. Additionally , the effect of lumbar puncture pressure on post-lumbar puncture headache<symptom> was evaluated. Methods Active idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients were prospectively recruited to a cohort study , lumbar puncture pressure and papilloedema grade were noted. Headache<symptom> severity was recorded using a numeric rating scale ( NRS) 0-10 , pre-lumbar puncture and following lumbar puncture at 1 , 4 and 6 hours and daily for 7 days. Results Fifty two patients were recruited ( mean lumbar puncture opening pressure 32 ( 28-37 cmCSF). At any point in the week post-lumbar puncture , headache<symptom> severity improved in 71 % ( but a small reduction of -1.1 ± 2.6 numeric rating scale) and exacerbated in 64 % , with 30 % experiencing a severe exacerbation ≥ 4 numeric rating scale. Therapeutic lumbar punctures are typically considered in idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients with severe<symptom> headaches<symptom> ( numeric rating scale ≥ 7). In this cohort , the likelihood of improvement was 92 % ( a modest reduction of headache<symptom> pain<symptom> by -3.0 ± 2.8 numeric rating scale , p = 0.012 , day 7) , while 33 % deteriorated. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients with mild ( numeric rating scale 1-3) or no headache<symptom> ( on the day of lumbar puncture , prior to lumbar puncture) had a high risk of post- lumbar puncture headache<symptom> exacerbation ( 81 % and 67 % respectively). Importantly , there was no relationship between lumbar puncture opening pressure and headache<symptom> response<symptom> after lumbar puncture. Conclusion Following lumbar puncture , the majority of idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients experience some improvement , but the benefit is small and post-lumbar puncture headache<symptom> exacerbation is common , and in some prolonged and severe. Lumbar puncture pressure does not influence the post-lumbar puncture
