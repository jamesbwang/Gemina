  Through-bond conjugated molecules are the major frameworks for traditional molecular wires , while through-space conjugated units are rarely utilized and studied although they have shown unique conducting potential. Herein , we present novel single-molecule wires built on through-space conjugated hexaphenylbenzene. Their conductance , measured by the scanning tunneling microscopy based break-junction technique , increases with the improvement of through-space conjugation and finally reaches a remarkable value ( 12.28 nS) which greatly exceeds that of conventional through-bond conjugated counterpart ( 2.45 nS). The multichannel conducting model by integrating through-space and through-bond conjugations could be a promising strategy for the further design of robust single-molecule wires with advanced conductance and stability.
