  The Notch receptor is an evolutionarily highly conserved transmembrane protein essential to a wide spectrum of cellular systems , and its deregulation has been linked to a vast number of developmental disorders and malignancies. Regulated Notch function is critical for the generation of T-cells , in which abnormal Notch signaling results in leukemia<disease>. Notch activation through
