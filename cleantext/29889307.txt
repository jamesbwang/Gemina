  Schizochytrium mangrovei strain PQ6 was investigated for coproduction of docosahexaenoic acid ( C22: 6ω-3 , DHA) and squalene using a 30-L bioreactor with a working volume of 15 L under various batch and fed-batch fermentation process regimes. The fed-batch process was a more efficient cultivation strategy for achieving higher biomass production rich in DHA and squalene. The final biomass , total lipid , unsaponifiable lipid content , and DHA productivity were 105.25 g · L
