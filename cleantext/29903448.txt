  This chapter is concerned with ideas on the function , structure , and pathology that shaped our present knowledge of the cerebellum. One of the main themes in its early history is its localization subtentorially , leading to misattributions due to clinical observations in trauma and lesion<symptom> experiments that caused collateral damage to the brainstem. Improvement of techniques led to the insight that it plays a role in movement control ( Rolando) or coordination ( Flourens). Purkinje initiated the histology of the cerebellar cortex in 1837. Luciani 's experiments in 1891 led him to conclude that the cerebellum has a tonic facilitating effect on central structures. Cajal identified the elements of the cortex and their circuitry ( 1888-1891). The inhibitory nature of the interneurons and the Purkinje cells , and the excitatory connections of the mossy and climbing afferents and the granule cells were established much later by Eccles and Ito. A functional localization for the coordinating action of the cerebellum of the motor system , based on local expansion of the folial chains , was devised by Bolk in 1906. Babinski and Holmes contributed to anatomoclinical insights. Magnus and coworkers showed the cerebellum does not play an essential role in body posture<symptom>. The heterogeneity of the Purkinje cells with respect to their connections and histochemistry found its expression in the zonal organization of the cerebellar cortex. The roots of modern developments , like cerebellar learning and its involvement in cognition and emotion , can be traced to the theories of Marr and Albus and the pioneering work of the Leiners and Dow.
