 : We aimed to present our clinical experience with maxillomandibular advancement ( MMA) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) syndrome<disease> and to compare our results with literature data.: The patients who were operated for OSA in the last 10 years were included in the study. A detailed patient 's charts review was retrospectively performed. Inclusion criteria were to be available with preoperative and postoperative polysomnography data.: There were totally 7 cases who underwent MMA procedure for OSA in our clinic. The mean age was 38.6 ± 8.1 years. Surgical success was achieved in all cases ( 100 %). The mean preoperative and postoperative apnea-hypopnea indexes were 63.3 ± 35.2 and 7.5 ± 3.4 , respectively ( P < 0.05). The most common complication was inferior alveolar nerve deficit following bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. The facial numbness was temporary in 4 ( 57.1 %) , and permanent in one case ( 14.3 %). Our surgical results in MMA is compatible with literature data. MMA is the choice of treatment in severe OSA in case of positive airway pressure therapy intolerance.
