  In February 2012 , a serious accident which resulted in five fatalities happened during a TBM-tunnel construction under the seabed in Japan. The cause of the accident appeared to be due to the Key-segment slipping out of the segment ring by the thrusting tailskin ( wire brushes) of the TBM into the segment ring. This resulted in the collapse of the rings , causing the seabed ground and seawater to flow into the tunnel. We investigated how thin and thick segments without any circumferential joints behave under isotropic and anisotropic pressures using small-scale physical model. In the model tests , pressures were applied to the surroundings of the segment rings and the strains at each segment were measured in order to evaluate the damage. In addition , cases where lubrication on the contact area between the K- and B-segments was present or not were investigated and their discrete element simulations were also conducted.
