  Trait emotional intelligence has recently emerged as a negative predictor of work-related distress. However , research that considers the mechanisms underlying the relationship between trait emotional intelligence and distress is lacking , in particular among workers with emotionally intensive occupations. The purpose of this study was to analyze the mediating pathway of coping behaviors in the relations between trait emotional intelligence , and work-related distress outcomes , namely secondary traumatic stress and job burnout in a sample of refugee resettlement workers. Participants were 210 resettlement workers from six organizations in the United States who completed a questionnaire. Questions included self-reported measures of secondary traumatic stress , burnout , trait emotional intelligence , coping behaviors , and history of trauma. The majority of participants identified as White ( 64.9 %) and female ( 73.6 %). The average participant was 32.96 years old ( SD = 10.22) and was employed in the same position for 2.64 years ( SD = 4.67). Unhealthy coping ( e.g. , substance use and denial) , emerged as a significant mediator of the relations between trait emotional intelligence and the outcomes , with 43 % and 64 % of the total effects for secondary traumatic stress and burnout mediated. Specifically , trait emotional intelligence negatively related to secondary traumatic stress and burnout via a reduction in unhealthy coping behaviors , rather than an increase in healthy coping ones. Training programs promoting the psychological well-being of employees often focus on the promotion of healthy coping practices. These results suggest the potential value of including trait emotional intelligence training in the development of such programs. ( PsycINFO Database Record
