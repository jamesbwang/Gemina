  Since 2013 , approximately 4400 women have been murdered by their partners in South Africa. This is five times higher than the per capita global average. Domestic violence is known to be cyclical , endemic and frequently involves multiple victims. It also becomes progressively more dangerous over time and may lead to fatalities. In 2012 , the Health Professions Council of South Africa released a domestic violence protocol for emergency service providers. This protocol , or screening guidelines , includes assessing future risk to domestic violence , providing physical and psychosocial care , documentation of evidence of abuse and informing patients of their rights and the services available to them. The extent to which these guidelines have been circulated and implemented , particularly by general health care practitioners ( HCPs) , is unknown. We review international treaties to which South Africa is a signatory , as well as national legislation and policies that reinforce the right to care for victims of domestic violence , to delineate the implication of these laws and policies for HCPs. We reviewed literature and analysed national and international legislation and policies. The ` norms ' contained in existing guidelines and currently practiced in an ad hoc manner are not only compatible with existing statutory duties of HCPs but are in fact a natural extension of them. Proactive interventions such as the use of guidelines for working with victims of domestic violence enable suspected cases of domestic violence to be systematically identified , appropriately managed , properly referred , and should be adopted by all South African HCPs.
