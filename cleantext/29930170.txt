  Abdominal compartment syndrome<disease> ( ACS) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality requiring prompt treatment. We report a rare case of a 57-year-old man who developed acute lower limb ischaemia , severe metabolic acidosis and renal impairment from massive faecal impaction of unknown aetiology resulting in ACS causing occlusion of the right common iliac artery. This was treated with faecal disimpaction , which eventually resulted in slow but full recovery.
