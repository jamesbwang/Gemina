  In earlier work , we laid out the foundation for explaining the quantum-like behavior of neural systems in the basic kinematic case of clusters of neuron-like units. Here we extend this approach to networks and begin developing a dynamical theory for them. Our approach provides a novel mathematical foundation for neural dynamics and computation which abstracts away from lower-level biophysical details in favor of information-processing features of neural activity. The theory makes predictions concerning such pathologies as schizophrenia , dementias , and epilepsy , for which some evidence has accrued. It also suggests a model of memory retrieval mechanisms. As further proof of principle , we analyze certain energy-like eigenstates of the 13 three-neuron motif classes according to our theory and argue that their quantum-like superpositional nature has a bearing on their observed structural integrity.
