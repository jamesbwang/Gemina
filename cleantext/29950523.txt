  Under fasting conditions , activation of several hepatic genes sets the stage for gluconeogenesis in the liver. cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB) , CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 ( CRTC2) , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-alpha ( PGC-1α) are essential for this transcriptional induction of gluconeogenic genes. PGC-1α induction is mediated by activation of a CREB/CRCT2 signaling complex , and recent findings have revealed that small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper protein ( SMILE) , a member of the CREB/ATF family of basic region-leucine zipper ( bZIP) transcription factors , is an insulin-inducible corepressor that decreases PGC-1α expression and abrogates its stimulatory effect on hepatic gluconeogenesis. However , the molecular mechanism whereby SMILE suppresses PGC-1α expression is unknown. Here , we investigated SMILE 's effects on the CREB/CRCT2 signaling pathway and glucose metabolism. We found that SMILE significantly inhibits CREB/CRTC2-induced PGC-1α expression by interacting with and disrupting the CREB/CRTC2 complex. Consequently , SMILE decreased PGC-1α-induced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Furthermore , SMILE inhibited CREB/CRTC2-induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase ( G6Pase) gene expression by directly repressing the expression of these genes and by indirectly inhibiting the expression of PGC-1α via CREB/CRTC2 repression. Indeed , enhanced gluconeogenesis and circulating blood glucose levels in mice injected with an adenovirus<pathogen> construct containing a constitutively active CRTC2 variant ( CRTC2-S171A) were significantly reduced by wild type SMILE , but not by leucine zipper mutated SMILE. These results reveal that SMILE represses CREB/CRTC2-induced PGC-1α expression , an insight that may help inform potential therapeutic approaches targeting PGC-1α-mediated regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism.
