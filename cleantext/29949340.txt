  The dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin ( DHP) from the terebellid polychaete Amphitrite ornata is a multifunctional hemoprotein that catalyzes the oxidation of a wide variety of substrates , including halo/nitrophenols , haloindoles , and pyrroles , via peroxidase and/or peroxygenase mechanisms. To probe whether substrate substituent effects can modulate enzyme activity in DHP , we investigated its reactiviy against a panel of o-guaiacol substrates given their presence ( from native/halogenated and non-native/anthropogenic sources) in the benthic environment that A. ornata inhabits. Using biochemical assays supported by spectroscopic , spectrometric , and structural studies , DHP was found to catalyze the H
