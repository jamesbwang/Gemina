  Seven new pimarane-type diterpene derivatives , libertellenones O-S ( 1-5) and eutypellenones A and B ( 6 and 7) , together with two known compounds ( 8 and 9) , were isolated from the culture of Eutypella sp.. D-1 obtained from high-latitude soil of the Arctic. Their structures were elucidated from spectroscopic data , as well as experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism ( ECD) analysis. Structurally , compounds 1-5 possess a cyclopropyl-fused pimarane diterpene moiety , whereas compounds 6 and 7 share an unusual cyclobutyl-fused pimarane diterpene skeleton. Compounds 1-9 exhibited cytotoxicities against HeLa , MCF-7 , HCT-116 , PANC-1 , and SW1990 cells , with IC
