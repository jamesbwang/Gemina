  The productive infection of influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) depends on host factors. However , the involvement of long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) in IAV<pathogen> infection remains largely uninvestigated. In this work , we have discovered a human lncRNA , named lncRNA-PAAN ( PA-associated noncoding RNA) that enhances IAV<pathogen> replication. The level of lncRNA-PAAN increases upon infection of IAV<pathogen> , but not other viruses , nor interferon treatment , suggesting specific up-regulation of lncRNA-PAAN expression by IAV<pathogen>. Silencing lncRNA-PAAN significantly decreases IAV<pathogen> replication through impairing the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp). This function of lncRNA-PAAN is a result of its association with viral PA protein , a key component of IAV<pathogen> RNA polymerase complex. Consequently , depletion of lncRNA-PAAN prevents the formation of functional RdRp. Together , these results suggest that lncRNA-PAAN promotes the assembly of viral RNA polymerase , thus warranting efficient viral RNA synthesis. Elucidating the functions of lncRNAs in IAV<pathogen> infection is expected to advance our understanding of IAV<pathogen> pathogenesis and open new avenues to the development of novel anti-IAV therapeutics.
