  In Spain , a comparative research study between those patients treated for suicide attempt and others treated by any other reason has n't been found. The aim of this study is to describe the differences between both types of patients in relation to sociodemographic and clinic variables together with the adverse vital events and the suicidal ideation. A descriptive , multicentric and case-controlled study carried out in psychiatric hospital emergencies where 207 patients had been evaluated for a suicidal attempt ( cases) and 233 were also evaluated by any other reasons ( checkings). The cases presented a larger percentage of previous suicide attempts ( 45.4 % vs. 30.0 %; p = 0.001) and a lower rates of prior emergency care ( 55.6 % vs. 65.7 %; p = 0.030) of a history of mental disorder ( 77.8 % vs. 86.7 %; p = 0.014) and follow-up in mental health. The 31.8 % ( n = 74) exhibited suicidal ideation at the time of care and the 61.4 % ( n = 143) expressed their desire to die when questioned. Neither a specific sociodemographic nor clinic profile of those who try to commit suicide has been found. But a high percentage of patients with suicidal ideation were identified in people treated for other reasons. The results emphasize the need to consider and evaluate the ideation of death and the risk of suicide in all the patients treated in psychiatric hospital emergencies.
