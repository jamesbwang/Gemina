  Multiple deadenylases are known in vertebrates , the PAN2-PAN3 ( PAN2/3) and CCR4-NOT ( CNOT) complexes , and PARN , yet their differential functions remain ambiguous. Moreover , the role of poly ( A) binding protein ( PABP) is obscure , limiting our understanding of the deadenylation mechanism. Here , we show that CNOT serves as a predominant nonspecific deadenylase for cytoplasmic poly ( A)
