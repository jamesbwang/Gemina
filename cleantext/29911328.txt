  Serine proteases have been re suggested as important mediators of visceral pain. We investigated their effect by using newly developed serine protease inhibitors with a well-characterized inhibitory profile in a rat model of post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS). Colitis<disease> was induced in rats receiving intrarectal trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid; controls received 0.9 % NaCl. Colonoscopies were performed on day 3 , to confirm colitis<disease> , and later until mucosal healing. Visceral hypersensitivity<disease> was quantified by visceromotor responses ( VMRs) to colorectal distension , 30 min after i.p. injection of the serine protease inhibitors nafamostat , UAMC-00050 or UAMC-01162. Serine proteases , protease-activated receptors ( PARs) and TRP channels were quantified by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Proteolytic activity was characterized using fluorogenic substrates. VMR was significantly elevated in post-colitis rats. Nafamostat normalized VMRs at the lowest dose tested. UAMC-00050 and UAMC-01162 significantly decreased VMR dose-dependently. Expression of mRNA for tryptase-αβ-1and PAR4 , and tryptase immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the colon of post-colitis animals. Trypsin-like activity was also significantly increased in the colon but not in the faeces. PAR2 and TRPA1 immunoreactivity co-localized with CGRP-positive nerve fibres in control and post-colitis animals. Increased expression of serine proteases and activity together with increased expression of downstream molecules at the colonic and DRG level and in CGRP-positive sensory nerve fibres imply a role for serine proteases in post-inflammatory visceral hypersensitivity<disease>. Our results support further investigation of serine protease inhibitors as an interesting treatment strategy for IBS-related visceral pain.
