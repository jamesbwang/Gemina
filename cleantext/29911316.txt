  Palmitoylation of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors ( AMPARs) subunits or their `` scaffold '' proteins produce opposite effects on AMPAR surface delivery. Considering AMPARs have long been identified as suitable drug targets for central nervous system ( CNS) disorders , targeting palmitoylation signaling to regulate AMPAR function emerges as a novel therapeutic strategy. However , until now , much less is known about the effect of palmitoylation-deficient state on AMPAR function. Herein , we set out to determine the effect of global de-palmitoylation on AMPAR surface expression and its function , using a special chemical tool , N- ( tert-Butyl) hydroxylamine ( NtBuHA). BS Bath application of NtBuHA ( 1.0 mM) reduced global palmitoylated proteins in the hippocampus of mice. Although NtBuHA ( 1.0 mM) did not affect the expression of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits , it preferentially decreased the surface expression of AMPARs , not N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors ( NMDARs). Notably , NtBuHA ( 1.0 mM) reduces AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents ( mEPSCs) in the hippocampus. This effect may be largely due to the de-palmitoylation of postsynaptic density protein 95 ( PSD95) and protein kinase A-anchoring proteins , both of which stabilized AMPAR synaptic delivery. Furthermore , we found that changing PSD95 palmitoylation by NtBuHA altered the association of PSD95 with stargazin , which interacted directly with AMPARs , but not NMDARs. Our data suggest that the palmitoylation-deficient state initiated by NtBuHA preferentially reduces AMPAR function , which may potentially be used for the treatment of CNS disorders , especially infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( Batten disease).
