  Neutrophil extracellular trap ( NET) formation requires chromatin decondensation before nuclear swelling and eventual extracellular release of DNA , which occurs together with nuclear and cytoplasmic antimicrobial proteins. A key mediator of chromatin decondensation is protein deiminase 4 ( PAD4) , which catalyzes histone citrullination. In the current study , we examined the role of PAD4 and NETosis following activation of neutrophils by
