  This article contains data on the synthesis and mechanical characterization of polysiloxane-based urea-elastomers ( PSUs) and is related to the research article entitled `` Influence of PDMS molecular weight on transparency and mechanical properties of soft polysiloxane-urea-elastomers for intraocular lens application '' ( Riehle et al. , 2018) ( 1). These elastomers were prepared by a two-step polyaddition using the aliphatic diisocyanate 4,4 '- Methylenbis ( cyclohexylisocyanate) ( H
