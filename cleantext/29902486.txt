  Healthcare-associated infection ( HCAI) affects millions of patients worldwide. HCAI is associated with increased healthcare costs , owing primarily to increased hospital length of stay ( LOS) but calculating these costs is complicated due to time-dependent bias. Accurate estimation of excess LOS due to HCAI is essential to ensure that we invest in cost-effective infection prevention and control ( IPC) measures. To identify and review the main statistical methods that have been employed to estimate differential LOS between patients with , and without , HCAI; to highlight and discuss potential biases of all statistical approaches. A systematic review from 1997 to April 2017 was conducted in PubMed , CINAHL , ProQuest and EconLit databases. Studies were quality-assessed using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale ( NOS). Methods were categorized as time-fixed or time-varying , with the former exhibiting time-dependent bias. Two examples of meta-analysis were used to illustrate how estimates of excess LOS differ between different studies. Ninety-two studies with estimates on excess LOS were identified. The majority of articles employed time-fixed methods ( 75 %). Studies using time-varying methods are of higher quality according to NOS. Studies using time-fixed methods overestimate additional LOS attributable to HCAI. Undertaking meta-analysis is challenging due to a variety of study designs and reporting styles. Study differences are further magnified by heterogeneous populations , case definitions , causative organisms , and susceptibilities. Methodologies have evolved over the last 20 years but there is still a significant body of evidence reliant upon time-fixed methods. Robust estimates are required to inform investment in cost-effective IPC interventions.
