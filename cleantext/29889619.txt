  Filamentous fungi<pathogen> from the genus Aspergillus<pathogen> are of high importance for the production of organic acids. Itaconic acid ( IA) is considered as an important component for the production of synthetic fibers , resin , plastics , rubber , paints , coatings , adhesives , thickeners and binders. Aspergillus niveus MG183809 was isolated from the soil sample ( wastewater unit) which was collected from Avadi , Chennai , India. In the present study , itaconic acid was successfully produced by isolated A. niveus by submerged batch fermentation. In the fermentation process , various low-cost substrates like corn starch , wheat flour and sweet potato were used for itaconic acid production. Further , the factor influencing parameters such as substrate concentration and incubation period were optimized. Maximum yield of itaconic acid ( 15.65 ± 1.75 g/L) was achieved by using A. niveus from corn starch at a concentration of 120 g/L after 168 hr ( pH 3.0). And also extraction of itaconic acid from the fermentation was performed with 91.96 ± 1.57 degree of extraction.
