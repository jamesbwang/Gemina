  The dependence of the activity of acetylcholinesterase from electric eel at a pH value range of 4.8-9.8 ( phosphate buffer) , regarding acetylcholine and acetylthiocholine hydrolysis , was determined at 25 Â°C , ionic strength of 0.11 M , and initial substrate concentration of 4 mM. At a pH range of 4.8-9.8 , the dependences A ( pH) form a sigmoid increasing curve with the maximum catalytic activity at a pH range 8-9.5. For acetylcholine hydrolysis , the kinetic reason for such an increase in A consists mainly of an increase in the rate constant k2 ( Michaelis-Menten) model with increasing pH of the reaction mixture. For acetylthiocholine hydrolysis , the kinetic explication of the determined dependence A ( pH) is more complicated.
