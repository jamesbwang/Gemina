  The present physical activity guidelines suggest that when the overall activity energy expenditure is held constant , moderate and vigorous intensity activities ( MVPA) provide equivalent health benefits. We explored associations between vigorous physical activity on body mass index whilst controlling for volume of MVPA. In a longitudinal study with 7 years follow-up ( n = 4770; aged 7 years old at baseline) , physical activity was measured objectively at baseline. Body mass index ( BMI) was measured at baseline and follow-up. Vigorous activity was expressed as the percentage of total MVPA. Participants in the highest vigorous activity tertile at baseline were at lower odds ( odds ratio = 0.70; 95 % CI: 0.55 , 0.88) of overweight/ obesity at follow-up compared with those in the lowest vigorous activity tertile after adjustment for total volume of MVPA , BMI at baseline , sex , ethnicity and social status. The results suggest vigorous activity , regardless of volume , is important in preventing excessive weight gain in young people.
