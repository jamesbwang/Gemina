  To evaluate the long-term effects of preventive measures against denture fracture using clinical surveys of denture fracture cases from 1984 and 2009. This study included 128 patients who presented with a chief complaint of denture fracture and received denture repair treatment in 2009. The following data were collected: denture repair procedure; location of denture base fracture ( with or without reinforcement); and period of denture use from insertion to repair. Significant differences in characteristics between patients treated in 1984 and 2009 were determined using the chi-square test ( P < .05). In 2009 , denture fractures comprised 55.5 % of all repair cases. The most frequent location of denture fracture was around the clasp and metal in the denture base. Approximately 45 % of all dentures were reinforced. The mean period from denture insertion to repair was 37 months. The number of denture fractures significantly decreased between 1984 and 2009 ( P < .05) , and the number of dentures with reinforcement significantly increased ( P < .05). The mean period from denture insertion to repair also increased. These findings suggest that denture reinforcement as a preventive measure is effective against denture fracture , allowing patients to use their dentures more effectively.
