  This article reports a new process for creating polymer-based nanocomposites with enhanced dispersion of ceramic nanoparticles without using any surfactants , and the resulted changes in their optical and biological properties. Specifically , dispersion of two different ceramic nanoparticles , i.e , hydroxyapatite ( nHA) and magnesium oxide ( nMgO) nanoparticles , in a model biodegradable polymer , namely poly ( lactic-co-glycolic acid) ( PLGA) , was studied. High-power sonication was integrated with dual asymmetric centrifugal ( DAC) mixing to improve dispersion of nanoparticles during solvent casting. The polymer/solvent ratio was optimized to improve nanoparticle dispersion in the multistep processing , including enhancing the efficacy of sonication and DAC mixing and reducing nanoparticle sedimentation during solvent-casting. Microstructural characterization confirmed that this new process improved nanoparticle dispersion in nMgO/PLGA and nHA/PLGA nanocomposites. Improved nanoparticle dispersion increased the optical transparency visually and optical transmission quantitatively for both nHA/PLGA and nMgO/PLGA nanocomposites. Improved dispersion of nanoparticles improved the adhesion of bone<disease> marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) on nHA/PLGA but decreased BMSC viability on nMgO/PLGA. This difference is likely because the chemistry of nHA and nMgO had different effects on BMSCs. This study provided a new process for enhancing dispersion of ceramic nanoparticles in a polymer matrix and revealed the effects of dispersion on optical properties and cell responses , which are valuable for engineering optimal ceramic/polymer nanocomposites for different biomedical applications.
