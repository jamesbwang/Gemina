  Scanning electron microscopes have longer focal depths than transmission electron microscopes and enable visualization of the three-dimensional ( 3D) surface structures of specimens. While scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) in biological research was generally used for the analysis of bulk specimens until around the year 2000 , more recent instrumental advances have broadened the application of SEM; for example , backscattered electron ( BSE) signals under low accelerating voltages allow block-face and section-face images of tissues embedded in resin to be acquired. This technical breakthrough has led to the development of novel 3D imaging techniques including focused ion beam SEM , serial-block face SEM and serial section SEM. Using these new techniques , the 3D shapes of cells and cell organelles have been revealed clearly through reconstruction of serial tomographic images. In this review , we address two modern SEM techniques: section-face imaging of resin-embedded tissue samples based on BSE observations , and serial section SEM for reconstruction of the 3D structures of cells and organelles from BSE-mode SEM images of consecutive ultrathin sections on solid substrates.
