  Family and friends play a pivotal role in caring for patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF); however , evidence of the impact of caregiving is limited. The objectives of this study were to describe the burden of caregiving on informal caregivers of patients with chronic HF in China. A cross-sectional survey of cardiologists , their patients with HF , and those patients ' caregivers was conducted. Patient record forms were completed by 150 cardiologists for 10 consecutive patients. Caregivers of these patients were invited to complete a questionnaire. Overall , 458 caregivers completed a questionnaire ( mean ± standard deviation age 60.1 ± 10.6 years; 60 % female; 77 % spouses; 74 % retired). Caregivers spent a mean of 24.5 ( 16.9) hours caregiving per week , and a third reported a reduction in their social activity , time for themselves , or time for family. Caregivers in employment took several days off work in the past 3 months owing to caregiving , sometimes resulting in reduced income. Up to 79 % of caregivers reported an impact on their physical or emotional well-being , and 57 % reported deterioration in their objective health status. Inconsistencies stemming from differences in the three-level five-dimension EuroQol questionnaire and HF Caregiver Questionnaire were observed for the impact of caregiving on caregivers ' health-related quality of life. Assisting patients with HF is associated with caregiver burden. Addressing the needs of caregivers may help to promote their continued support and improve patient outcomes.
