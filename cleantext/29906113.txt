  Four tridentate europium ( III) complexes containing a diphenylphosphoryl group are prepared with strong bonding between the ligands and centered ion , convinced by crystal structures. Compared to their parent bidentate complexes , the tridentate complexes display improved and exceptionally high photoluminescence quantum yields ( PLQYs) in powder ( all over 80 % , best 91 %) , as well as in a CH
