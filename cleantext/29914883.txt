  Those living in rural areas have poorer cancer outcomes , but current evidence on how rurality impacts melanoma care and survival is contradictory. To investigate the impact of rurality on setting of melanoma excision and mortality in a whole-nation cohort. Analysis of linked routine healthcare data comprising every individual in Scotland diagnosed with melanoma , January 2005-December 2013 , in primary and secondary care. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between rurality and setting of melanoma excision; Cox proportional hazards regression between rurality and mortality was used , with adjustments for key confounders. In total 9519 patients were included ( 54.3 % ( Patients in Scottish rural locations were more likely to have a melanoma excised in primary care. However , those in rural areas did not have significantly increased mortality from melanoma. Together these findings suggest that current UK melanoma management guidelines could be revised to be more realistic by recognising the role of primary care in the prompt diagnosis and treatment of those in rural locations.
