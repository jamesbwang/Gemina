  To analyze the prevalence of ultra-processed food intake among children under one year of age and to identify associated factors. A cross-sectional design was employed. We interviewed 198 mothers of children aged between 6 and 12 months in primary healthcare units located in a city of the metropolitan region of SÃ£o Paulo , Brazil. Specific foods consumed in the previous 24h of the interview were considered to evaluate the consumption of ultra-processed foods. Variables related to mothers ' and children 's characteristics as well as primary healthcare units were grouped into three blocks of increasingly proximal influence on the outcome. A Poisson regression analysis was performed following a statistical hierarchical modeling to determine factors associated with ultra-processed food intake. The prevalence of ultra-processed food intake was 43.1 %. Infants that were not being breastfed had a higher prevalence of ultra-processed food intake but no statistical significance was found. Lower maternal education ( prevalence ratio 1.55 ( 1.08-2.24)) and the child 's first appointment at the primary healthcare unit having happened after the first week of life ( prevalence ratio 1.51 ( 1.01-2.27)) were factors associated with the consumption of ultra-processed foods. High consumption of ultra-processed foods among children under 1 year of age was found. Both maternal socioeconomic status and time until the child 's first appointment at the primary healthcare unit were associated with the prevalence of ultra-processed food intake.
