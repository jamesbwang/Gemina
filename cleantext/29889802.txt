  Hepatoblastoma ( HB) is the most common liver malignancy in children. The prognosis changes according to the histologic subtypes of HB. In the present study , we aimed to characterize the expression level of selected microRNAs ( miRNAs) in HB as well as in histologic subtypes , and to consider the association with the prognosis. A total of 22 HB tumor samples , subtyped as fetal ( n = 16) and embryonal ( n = 6) , and 10 nontumorous surrounding liver samples were evaluated in this study. Expressions of miR-17 , miR-146a , miR-302d , and miR-19b were analyzed in 22 HB tumor samples and 10 nontumorous surrounding liver samples by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Lower miRNA-17 expression levels were obtained in tumor samples in comparison with nontumorous surrounding liver samples ( P = 0.028). Lower miRNA-17 expression was significant for predicting prognosis in HB patients ( area under receiver-operator characteristic curve = 0.875 , P = 0.044). A higher-level of miR-19b was found in embryonal samples ( P = 0.008). Overall and event-free survival was not found to correlate with miRNA expression levels ( P > 0.05). This research finds miRNA-17 and miRNA-19b expression levels can provide important data on diagnosis and prognosis in HB showing different clinical behaviors.
