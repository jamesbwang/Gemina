  Venous thromboembolic events ( VTE) are a common complication of total knee arthroplasty ( TKA). Prior studies have discussed the utility of mechanical VTE prophylaxis as a monotherapy for low-risk TKA patients. We assess the incidence of clinically significant deep venous thrombosis ( DVT) or pulmonary embolism ( PE) in low-risk TKA patients who receive mechanical VTE prophylaxis and undergo spinal , epidural , or general anesthesia for their surgery. A retrospective study was performed on consecutive low-risk patients who received a TKA between July 2002 and June 2015 with spinal anesthesia ( No clinically symptomatic DVT or PE was diagnosed. Patient demographics were equivocal. A statistically significant decrease in prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times were noted in the general anesthesia group , but all measurements were within the normal range. A short course of mechanical VTE prophylaxis may be appropriate for low-risk patients who can immediately mobilize.
