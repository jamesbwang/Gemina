  β-Amyloid peptide ( Aβ) is a potent neurotoxic protein associated with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) which causes oxidative damage to neurons. Incensole acetate ( IA) is a major constituent of Boswellia carterii resin , which has anti-inflammatory and protective properties against damage of a large verity of neural subtypes. However , this neuroprotective effect was not studied on human olfactory bulb neural stem cells ( hOBNSCs). Herein , we evaluated this effect and studied the underlying mechanisms. Exposure to Aβ
