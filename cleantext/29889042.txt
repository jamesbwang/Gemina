  Urolithiasis prevalence is 2-20 % according to different geographic characteristics in different populations. In this study , we aimed to present the distribution of operation numbers for both percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery ( RIRS) in terms of age and stone size in order to reveal the changes over the years. Between January 2010 and March 2016 , 1814 patients were operated for the treatment of renal stones. Patients were directed to the two different operations according to the surgeons ' choices: RIRS or PCNL. Prospectively collected data was retrospectively reviewed. In the years 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 , the number of RIRS applied for the treatment of renal stones was 25 , 87 , 96 , 147 , 166 , 174 , and 66 , respectively. RIRS was significantly preferred more than PCNL for stones < 1.5 cm. Examining the ages , there was no different data described as above for stone sizes. Despite RIRS is the new trend for treating stone disease , PCNL remains its important role for especially the larger stone sizes. RIRS is the raising trend for small sizes.
