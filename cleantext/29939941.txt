  X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency<disease> disease<disease> ( SCID) is caused by mutations in the interleukin ( IL) -2 receptor Î³ ( IL2RG) gene and patients usually present with a TBNK SCID phenotype. Nevertheless , a minority of these patients present with a TBNK phenotype , similar to the IL-7R-deficient patients. We report a patient with a novel missense p.Glu297Gly mutation in the IL2RG gene presenting with a leaky TBNK SCID with delayed onset , moderate susceptibility to infections , and nodular regenerative hyperplasia<disease>. He presents with preserved STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-15 stimulation but not in response to IL-2 and IL-7 , resulting in the NK phenotype.
