  Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPS) placement using the same-diameter covered stents can lead to differed declines of portal venous pressure declines ( PVDs). This study aimed to compare the long-term shunt patency and clinical efficacy of TIPS placement that caused low PVDs ( ≤ 9 mmHg) and high PVDs ( > 9 mmHg). A total of 129 patients treated by TIPS placement with 8 mm-diameter polytetrafluoroethylene covered stents were included and analyzed retrospectively. They were stratified into group A with low PVDs ( n = 69) and group B with high PVDs ( n = 60). The 6-year actuarial probabilities of remaining free of shunt dysfunction ( 47.2 % vs 64.6 %; p = 0.007) and variceal rebleeding ( 48.3 % vs 63.9 %; p = 0.038) were significantly lower in group A than in group B. The 6-year actuarial probability of remaining free of hepatic encephalopathy was significantly higher in group A than in group B ( 44.5 % vs 32.5 %; p = 0.010) , though the 6-year cumulative survival rate was similar in both groups ( A vs B: 65.5 % vs 56.0 %; p = 0.240). The baseline portal vein thrombosis ( hazard ratio ( HR): 6.045 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 2.762-13.233; p = 0.000) and stent type ( HR: 4.447 , 95 % CI: 1.711-11.559 , p = 0.002) were associated with shunt dysfunction , whereas only ascites was associated with mortality ( HR: 1.373 , 95 % CI: 1.114-3.215; p = 0.024). High PVDs ( > 9 mmHg) were associated with higher shunt patency , lower incidence of variceal rebleeding , but higher frequency of hepatic encephalopathy and similar survival rate than low PVDs ( ≤ 9 mmHg) after TIPS placement.
