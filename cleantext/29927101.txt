  We read with great interest the article by Liu et al ( 1) recently published in the last issue of Arthritis<disease> & Rheumatology , in which the authors reported that blood T follicular regulatory ( Tfr) cells are increased in untreated rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) patients , especially in those in stable remission , where the Tfr/T follicular helper ( Tfh) ratio is also increased. However , in our own RA cohort we observed a significant number of discrepant findings from those reported by Liu et al.. We have recently defined the phenotype and function of human circulating Tfr cells ( 2). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
