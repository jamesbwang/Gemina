  Little is known about the role of lincRNA-p21 in the development of diabetic nephropathy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the level of lincRNA-p21 in diabetic nephropathy , and explore its underlying mechanism. The current study revealed that down-regulation of lincRNA-p21 could alleviate pathological changes of diabetic nephropathy in mice. LincRNA-p21 expression was significantly up-regulated in MMCs under high glucose condition in
