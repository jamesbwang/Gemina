  To identify the incidence of orthopaedic injuries secondary to dog bites , determine the responsible breeds and assess the severity of injury by dog breed. Retrospective. Single Level 1 trauma center. Ninety-five patients treated for a dog bite that resulted in an orthopaedic injury between January 2010 and July 2016. Patients were treated according to their specific orthopaedic injury. Dog breed and type of orthopaedic injury. Thirty-nine percent of all dog-bite related emergency department visits resulted in an orthopaedic injury requiring specialist treatment. Of the 95 patients , 50 % were the result of a pit bull terrier bite and 22 % by a law enforcement dog. A total of 32 % were attacked by multiple dogs. There was a 51 % incidence of severe injury ( amputation or fracture) with a significant association to breed. Thirty-nine percent of all dog-bite related emergency department visits at our facility resulted in an injury requiring orthopaedic treatment. Pit bull terrier bites were responsible for a significantly higher number of orthopaedic injuries and resulted in an amputation and/or bony injury in 66 % of patients treated , while bites from law enforcement dogs and other breeds were less associated with severe injuries. Prognostic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
