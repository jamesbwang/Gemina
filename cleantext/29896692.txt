  In vivo pregnant study protocols covering preconceptional exposure as well as prenatal and postnatal development including the lactation period to screen the toxic effects on specific elements of the highly complicated reproductive cycle are time-consuming and expensive. Morphology-based whole embryo culture is the most common alternative in vitro embryotoxicity method to evaluate the early developmental toxicity of drugs. Here we share our procedures and experience in the whole embryo culture for drug embryotoxicity assessments.
