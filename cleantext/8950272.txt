  Palmoplantar keratoderma ( PPK) is a rare group of excessive skin disorder characterized by thickness over the palms and soles. The striate palmoplantar keratoderma ( PPKS) is a form in which hyperkeratotic lesions<symptom> are restricted to the pressure regions extending longitudinally in the length of each finger to the palm. Dominantly inherited mutations in genes including desmoglein 1 , desmoplakin and keratin 1 have been suggested as genetic causes of PPKS. In this study , we investigated a three-generation Pakistani family segregating PPKS phenotype in autosomal dominant fashion to identify genetic cause in this family. We have performed whole-exome and Sanger sequencing followed by in silico bioinformatics analysis to pinpoint candidate mutation associated with PPK. Revealed a novel heterozygous mutation ( NM_020882.2 , COL20A1 c. 392C > G; p.Ser131Cys) in the loop region close to fibronectin type III-1 domain of the c ollagen 20 α1. This variant was not found in our in-house 219 ethnically matched Pakistani unaffected controls and showed minor allele frequency of 3.4 × 10
