  Malignant tumours consist of biologically heterogeneous components; identifying and stratifying those various subregions is an important research topic. We aimed to show the effectiveness of an intratumour partitioning method using clustering to identify highly aggressive tumour subregions , determining prognosis based on pre-treatment PET and DWI in stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. Eighteen patients who underwent both baseline PET and DWI were recruited. Pre-treatment imaging of SUV and ADC values were used to form intensity vectors within manually specified ROIs. We applied k-means clustering to intensity vectors to yield distinct subregions , then chose the subregion that best matched the criteria for high SUV and low ADC to identify tumour subregions with high aggressiveness. We stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups based on subregion volume with high aggressiveness and conducted survival analyses. This approach is referred to as the partitioning approach. For comparison , we computed tumour subregions with high aggressiveness without clustering and repeated the described procedure; this is referred to as the voxel-wise approach. The partitioning approach led to high-risk ( median SUVmax = 14.25 and median ADC = 1.26 x10 Our partitioning approach identified intratumour subregions that were predictors of survival. • Multimodal imaging of PET and DWI is useful for assessing intratumour heterogeneity. • Data-driven clustering identified subregions which might be highly aggressive for lung adenocarcinoma. • The data-driven partitioning results might be predictors of survival.
