  To explore , in a general practice setting , the concerns , beliefs and attitudes about intrauterine contraception ( IUC) reported by women , who had never used the methods. We used a sequential mixed-method ( QUAL/quant) approach. A pragmatic , self-selecting sample of 30 women , aged 18-46 years , who had never used IUC) , was recruited through seven general practices in South East England. Themes arising from qualitative interviews were used to construct a quantitative survey , completed by a pragmatic sample of 1195 women , aged 18-49 years , attending 32 general practices in the same region , between February and August 2015. Qualitative themes were concerns about the long-acting nature of IUC , concerns about body boundaries , and informal knowledge of IUC , especially ` friend of a friend ' stories. Women were not sure if the devices can be removed before their full 5- or 10-year duration of use , and felt that these timeframes did not fit with their reproductive intentions. Quantitative survey data showed that the most commonly endorsed concerns among never-users were painful fitting ( 55.8 %) , unpleasant removal of the device ( 60.1 %) , and concern about having a device ` inside me ' ( 60.2 %). To facilitate fully informed contraceptive choice , information provided to women considering IUC should be tailored to more fully address the concerns expressed by never-users , particularly around the details of insertion and removal , and concerns about the adverse , long-term effects of the device. Women need to be reassured that IUC can be removed and fertility restored at any time following insertion. Trial registration NIHR CRN portfolio; 15912.
