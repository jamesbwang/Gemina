  Melanoma antigen family A4 ( MAGEA4) , a cancer/testis antigen , is overexpressed and is thus an immunotherapy target in various malignant tumors , including non-small cell lung cancer. However , whether MAGEA4 induces or inhibits the apoptosis of lung cancer cells remains controversial , as is its prognostic significance , particularly since there is no reliable method with which to detect MAGEA4 specifically. In this study , we optimized assay conditions to detect MAGEA4 based on cells transiently transfected with MAGEA genes , and found that MAGEA4 was expressed in four of eight non-small cell lung cancer cell lines , and in 25.4 % of clinical lung cancer specimens. We also found that MAGEA4 overexpression decreased apoptosis , as measured by the levels of cleaved caspase-3 in stably transfected 293F cells. Notably , patients with nuclear MAGEA4 , but not p53 expression exhibited a significantly poorer survival than those expressing both nuclear MAGEA4 and p53. Indeed , multivariate analysis identified nuclear MAGEA4 as an independent prognostic factor ( P = 0.0042) , albeit only in the absence of p53. In this study , to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to demonstrate that the function and prognostic value of MAGEA4 depends on its subcellular localization and on the p53 status.
