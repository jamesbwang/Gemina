  Chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) patients in sustained `` deep molecular response '' may stop TKI treatment without disease recurrence; however , half of them lose molecular response shortly after TKI withdrawing. Well-defined eligibility criteria to predict a safe discontinuation up-front are still missing. Relapse is probably due to residual quiescent TKI-resistant leukemic stem cells ( LSCs) supposedly transcriptionally low/silent and not easily detectable by BCR-ABL1 qRT-PCR.
