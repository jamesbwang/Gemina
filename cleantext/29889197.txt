  Vanadium dioxide is a material that has a reversible metal-insulator phase change near 68 °C. To grow VO2 on a wide variety of substrates , with wafer-scale uniformity and angstrom level control of thickness , the method of atomic-layer deposition was chosen. This ALD process enables high-quality , low-temperature ( ≤ 150 °C) growth of ultrathin films ( 100-1000 Å) of VO2. For this demonstration , the VO2 films were grown on sapphire substrates. This low temperature growth technique produces mostly amorphous VO2 films. A subsequent anneal in an ultra-high vacuum chamber with a pressure of 7x10
