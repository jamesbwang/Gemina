  All members of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily encode a serine/threonine kinase , designated Us3 , which is not conserved in the other subfamilies. Us3 is a significant virulence factor for herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus type 1 ( HSV-1) , which is one of the best-characterized members of the Alphaherpesvirinae family. Accumulating evidence indicates that HSV-1 Us3 is a multifunctional protein that plays various roles in the viral life cycle by phosphorylating a number of viral and cellular substrates. Therefore , the identification of Us3 substrates is directly connected to understanding Us3 functions and mechanisms. To date , more than 23 phosphorylation events upregulated by HSV-1 Us3 have been reported. However , few of these have been shown to be both physiological substrates of Us3 in infected cells and directly linked with Us3 functions in infected cells. In this chapter , we summarize the 12 physiological substrates of Us3 and the Us3-mediated functions. Furthermore , based on the identified phosphorylation sites of Us3 or Us3 homolog physiological substrates , we reverified consensus phosphorylation target sequences on the physiological substrates of Us3 and Us3 homologs in vitro and in infected cells. This information might aid the further identification of novel Us3 substrates and as yet unidentified Us3 functions.
