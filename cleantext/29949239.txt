  Sphingolipids and sterols are major components of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. A recent study provides new insight into the intricate but fundamental relationship between Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> membrane lipid composition and membrane biophysical properties , by showing that sphingolipids and sterols co-ordinately regulate cell wall integrity.
