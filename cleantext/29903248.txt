  To explore if inhibiting the expression of wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 ( WIP1) could enhance the sensitivity of A549 cells to arsenic. To inhibit expression of WIP1 , WIP1 siRNA was transferred into A549 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000. Then the protein expression levels of P53 phosphorylation proteins and their downstream effectors were detected by western-blot analysis. Cell apoptosis were assessed by Annexin V-FITC stain assay. The sensitivity of transferred cells to arsenic was detected by using MTT assay. The mRNA and protein expression level of WIP1 were all decreased by 70 % in A549 cells transferred with WIP1 siRNA. Western-blot analysis indicated that P53 phosphorylation process was much accelerated in WIP1-inhibited cells after arsenic treatment. For example , compared to control cells , an significant decrease in P53 ser15 expression and an increase in P53 ser46 expression was found in WIP1-inhibited cells when treated with As_2O_3 ( 5-40 μmol/L). In addition , compared to control group , the expression of P21 decreased whereas PUMA increased in WIP1-inhibited cells when treated with As_2O_3 ( 10-40 μmol/L). Cell viability of WIP1-inhibited cells after As_2O_3 treatment ( 5-40 μmol/L) was significantly higher than that of the control group , which may be due to a high apoptosis rate in WIP1-inhibited cells. WIP1 could be used as a new target in arsenic-base anticancer therapies.
