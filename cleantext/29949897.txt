  It is widely known that rapid population growth and income improvement in some developing countries , and growing health consciousness<symptom> in some developed countries , are the main factors that have contributed to the global increase in the consumption of fishery products in the past few decades. While a detailed analysis of fish consumption behavior is being conducted in several countries , there are other countries where changes in fish consumption desire and their social and psychological factors are not fully clarified. This study investigates the changes in fish consumption desire and its associated factors in the United Kingdom ( UK) and Singapore. Primary data were gathered from 1200 participants through a web questionnaire survey in the UK and Singapore. The results show that approximately five times as many respondents stated that the desire to purchase fish had increased in both the UK and Singapore compared to those that believed it had not 10 years ago. Second , the increase in fish consumption in the UK is positively associated with younger age , cheaper price , the health benefits of fish , concern over the health of meat , and religion. Third , the increase in fish consumption in Singapore is positively associated with cheaper prices and is negatively associated with concerns over sustainability.
