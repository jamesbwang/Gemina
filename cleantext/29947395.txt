  Three novel fluorescent aminophosphine ligands have been synthesised that incorporate napthyl ( L1) , pyrenyl ( L2) and anthraquinone ( L3) chromophores into their structures. The ligands react with ( AuCl ( tht)) ( tht = tetrahydrothiophene) to give neutral complexes of the form ( AuCl ( L1-3)). Solid state , X-ray crystallographic data was obtained for the anthraquinone derivative , ( AuCl ( L3)) , and showed a distorted linear coordination geometry at Au ( i). The packing structure also revealed a number of intermolecular π-π interactions that involve the anthraquinone and phenyl units of the aminophosphine ligand. 31P NMR spectroscopic data revealed δP values of +42.2 ( L1) , +42.1 ( L2) and +26.1 ( L3) ppm , which shifted downfield upon coordination to Au ( i) to +64.6 , +64.7 , and +55.8 ppm , respectively. Supporting TD-DFT studies were able to reproduce the structure and 31P NMR chemical shifts of ( AuCl ( L3)) as well as rationalise the HOMO-LUMO compositions. Photophysical studies showed that the appended fluorophore dominates the absorption and emission properties for the ligands and complexes , with the anthraquinone derivatives showing visible emission at ca. 570 nm which was attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer character of the phosphinoaminoanthraquinone fragment.
