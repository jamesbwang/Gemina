  Temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE) , the most common pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy disorder , remains a major unmet medical need. Propofol is used as short-acting medication for general anesthesia and refractory status epilepticus with issues of decreased consciousness<symptom> and memory<symptom> loss<symptom>. Dipropofol , a derivative of propofol , has been reported to exert antioxidative and antibacterial activities. Here we report that dipropofol exerted anticonvulsant activity in mouse model of kainic acid-induced seizures<symptom>. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of brain slices from the medial entorhinal cortex ( mEC) revealed that dipropofol hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential and reduced the number of action potential firings , resulting in suppression of cortical neuronal excitability. Furthermore , dipropofol activated native tonic GABA
