  The purpose of this study was to assess and analyze the radiation doses during head pediatric CT from different CT units within six Tunisian hospitals representing different geographic regions in order to optimize the dose given and minimize the radiology risk to this category of patients and towards the derivation of national diagnostic reference levels. Patient data and exposure parameters were collected for four age groups ( < 1 , 1-5 , 5-10 and 10-15 y). Clinical protocols and exposure settings were analyzed. Doses were collected in terms of CTDIvol and DLP values. Effective and Organ doses to specific radiosensitive organs were estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation software ` Impact CTDosimetry '. Results showed large variations in CT protocols and doses between different radiology departments. CTDIvol and DLP values demonstrated a broad range between the CT units and between the axial and helical scan techniques in the same unit. CTDI vol values were estimated to be 24.9 , 31.7 , 45.5 and 47.8 mGy for < 1 , 1-5 , 5-10 and 10-15 y age groups , respectively. In term of DLP , median values were ~ 346 , 528 , 824 , 897 mGy cm for the same age groups , respectively. Effective dose ranged from 1.4 to 5 mSv. Dose values were comparable with those reported in the literature. The study shows an evident need for continuous training of staff in radiation protection concepts , especially within the regional hospitals , emphasizes the importance of the production and the update of recommendations and good practice guidelines using interdisciplinary working groups and opens the way for the establishment of national DRLs.
