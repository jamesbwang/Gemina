  Hederagenin is an effective constituent of many medical plants , such as Clematidis<pathogen> Radix , and has a wide range of applications in anti-tumor , anti-inflammatory , antidepressant , hepatoprotective antibacterial , et al.. In order to obtain the efficient production of yeast cells for hederagenin , we successfully cloned and screened out a P450 gene MdMA02 from Malus × domestica which can catalyze oleanolic acid C-23 oxidation with our developed plug and play platform. Its amino acid homology is only 32 % as compared to characterized CYP72A68v2. By transforming MdMA02 to the oleanolic acid-producing strain BY-OA , a hederagenin-producing strain was constructed and hederagenin 's titer could achieve 101 mg · L ⁻¹ using high cell density fermentation , which was 337 times higher than in shake flasks culturing. This study provides a basis for further research on promoting the creation of oleanane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids biosynthetic pathway analysis and relative cell factories construction.
