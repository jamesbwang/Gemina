  This study aimed at ( 1) deriving Bayesian methods to predict breeding values for ratio ( i.e. feed conversion ratio; FCR) or linear ( i.e. residual feed intake; RFI) traits; ( 2) estimating genetic parameters for average daily feed consumption ( ADFI) , average daily weight gain ( ADG) , lean meat percentage ( LMP) along with the derived traits of RFI and FCR; and ( 3) deriving Bayesian estimates of direct and correlated responses to selection on RFI , FCR , ADG , ADFI , and LMP. Response to selection was defined as the difference in additive genetic mean of the selected top individuals , expected to be parents of the next generation , and the total population after integrating genetic trends out of the posterior distribution of selection responses. Inferences were based on marginal posterior distributions obtained from the Bayesian method for integration over unknown population parameters and `` fixed '' environmental effects and for appropriate handling of ratio traits. Terminal line pigs ( n = 3724) were used for a multi-variate model for ADFI , ADG , and LMP. RFI was estimated from the conditional distribution of ADFI given ADG and LMP , using either genetic ( RFI Posterior means of heritability were 0.32 , 0.26 , 0.56 , 0.20 , and 0.15 for ADFI , ADG , LMP , RFI The Bayesian methodology developed here enables prediction of breeding values for FCR and RFI from a single multi-variate model. In addition , we derived posterior distributions of direct and correlated responses to selection. Genetic parameter estimates indicated a genetic basis for the studied traits and that genetic improvement through selection was possible. Direct selection against FCR or RFI
