  Previous studies have demonstrated that cochlear implant ( CI) patients are more efficient at performing sound categorisation than sound identification. However , it remains unclear how this categorisation capacity develops with time during the rehabilitation period after implantation. To investigate the role of the post-implantation auditory experience in the broad sound<symptom> categorisation in CI patients , we recruited CI patients with different durations of CI experience: Newly implanted CI patients ( less than six months) , Intermediate CI patients ( 6-14 months) and Experienced CI patients with a duration of implantation greater than 14 months. The patients completed a Free Sorting Task ( FST) , which allowed them to categorise 16 natural sounds<symptom> based on their own criteria. We found an early deficit in categorisation , especially for vocal sounds<symptom>; the categorisation started to improve after approximately six months post-implantation with a change of categorisation strategy which relied on different acoustic cues as a function of time after CI. The separation of the category of vocal sounds<symptom> from other sounds<symptom> significantly increased between the Newly implanted and Intermediate groups , i.e. as experience with the cochlear implant was acquired. The categorisation accuracy of vocal sounds<symptom> was significantly correlated with the post-implantation period only in the group of newly implanted CI patients. This is the first study to show that the categorisation of vocal sounds<symptom> with respect to non-vocal sounds<symptom> improves during the rehabilitation period post-implantation. The first six-month post-implantation period appears to be crucial in this process. Our results demonstrate that patients in different rehabilitation periods use different acoustic cues , which increase their complexity with the CI experience.
