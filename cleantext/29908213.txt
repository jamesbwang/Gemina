  We studied HLA class I ( HLA-A ,- B) and class II ( HLA-DRB1 ,- DQB1) alleles by PCR-SSP based typing in a total of 1101 Ecuadorian individuals from three regions of the country , the Coastal region , the Andean region , and the Amazonian region , to obtain information regarding allelic and haplotypic frequencies and their linkage disequilibrium. We find that the most frequent HLA haplotypes with significant linkage disequilibrium in those populations are HLA-A ∗ 24 ∼ B ∗ 35 ∼ DRB1 ∗ 04 ∼ DQB1 ∗ 03:02 , A ∗ 02 ∼ B ∗ 35 ∼ DRB1 ∗ 04 ∼ DQB1 ∗ 03:02 , A ∗ 24 ∼ B ∗ 35 ∼ DRB1 ∗ 14 ∼ DQB1 ∗ 03:01 , A ∗ 02 ∼ B ∗ 35 ∼ DRB1 ∗ 14 ∼ DQB1 ∗ 03:01 and A ∗ 02 ∼ B ∗ 40:02 ∼ DRB1 ∗ 04 ∼ DQB1 ∗ 03:02. The only non-Native American haplotype with frequency > 1 % shared by all groups was A ∗ 29 ∼ B ∗ 44 ∼ DRB1 ∗ 07 ∼ DQB1 ∗ 02. Admixture estimates obtained by a maximum likelihood method using HLA-B as genetic estimator revealed that the main genetic components for this sample of mixed-ancestry Ecuadorians are Native American ( ranging from 52.86 % to 63.83 %) and European ( from 28.95 % to 46.54 %) , while an African genetic component was only apparent in the Coastal region ( 18.19 %). Our findings provide a starting point for the study of population immunogenetics of Ecuadorian populations.
