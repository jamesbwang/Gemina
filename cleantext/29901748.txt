  Binding reactions of HgII and AgI to pyrimidine-pyrimidine mismatches in duplex DNA were characterized using fluorescent nucleobase analogs , thermal denaturation and 1H NMR. Unlike AgI , HgII exhibited stoichiometric , site-specific binding of C-T mismatches. The on- and off-rates of HgII binding were approximately 10-fold faster to C-T mismatches ( kon ≈ 105 M-1 s-1 , koff ≈ 10-3 s-1) as compared to T-T mismatches ( kon ≈ 104 M-1 s-1 , koff ≈ 10-4 s-1) , resulting in very similar equilibrium binding affinities for both types of ` all natural ' metallo base pairs ( Kd ≈ 10-150 nM). These results are in contrast to thermal denaturation analyses , where duplexes containing T-T mismatches exhibited much larger increases in thermal stability upon addition of HgII ( ΔTm = 6-19 °C) , as compared to those containing C-T mismatches ( ΔTm = 1-4 °C). In addition to revealing the high thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of C-HgII-T base pairs , our results demonstrate that fluorescent nucleobase analogs enable highly sensitive detection and characterization of metal-mediated base pairs- even in situations where metal binding has little or no impact on the thermal stability of the duplex.
