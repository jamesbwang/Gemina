That is a problem , because the lack of a consensus definition makes it difficult to compare studies of reproducibility , and thus to have even a broad overview of the state of the issue in natural language processing.

We show that three dimensions of reproducibility , corresponding to three kinds of claims in natural language processing papers , can account for a variety of types of research reports. These dimensions are reproducibility of a
