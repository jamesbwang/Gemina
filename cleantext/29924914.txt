  To determine the efficacy of the addition of an ultrasound of the groins in routine follow-up of patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) after a negative sentinel lymph node ( SLN). Prospective single center study. A tertiary expert oncology center for the treatment of vulvar cancer. All vulvar SCC patients with a negative SLN , treated between 2006 and 2014. We prospectively collected data of 139 vulvar SCC patients treated with a SLN procedure. We analyzed data of 76 patients with a negative SLN. Three-monthly follow-up visits consisted of physical examination combined with an ultrasound of the groins by a radiologist. The diagnostic value of ultrasound in the follow-up of vulvar SCC patients with a negative SLN during the first two years after treatment. During a routine visit , two asymptomatic isolated groin recurrences were detected. Both patients were treated by inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy , and are alive without evidence of disease 39 and 120 months after diagnosis. In total , 348 ultrasounds and 29 fine needle aspirations were performed. The sensitivity of ultrasound to detect a groin metastasis was 100 % ( 95 % CI 16 % -100 %) and specificity 92 % ( 95 % CI 89 % -95 %). Routine follow-up including ultrasound of the groin led to early detection of asymptomatic isolated groin recurrences. Further research is necessary to determine the exact role of ultrasound in the follow-up of vulvar SCC patients with a negative SLN. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
