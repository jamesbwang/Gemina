  Although high-risk human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HR‑HPV) infection has a prominent role in the aetiology of cervical cancer ( CC) , sex steroid hormones may also be involved in this process; however , the cooperation between oestrogen and HR‑HPV in the early stages of cervical carcinogenesis is poorly understood. Since 17β-oestradiol ( E2) and the HPV<pathogen> type 16‑E7 oncoprotein induce CC in transgenic mice , a microarray analysis was performed in the present study to generate global gene expression profiles from 2‑month‑old FVB ( non‑transgenic) and K14E7 ( transgenic) mice who were left untreated or were treated for 1 month with E2. Upregulation of cancer-related genes that have not been previously reported in the context of CC , including glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 3 , interleukin 1 receptor type II , natriuretic peptide type C , MGAT4 family member C , lecithin-retinol acyltransferase ( phosphatidylcholine-retinol-O-acyltransferase) and glucoside xylosyltransferase 2 , was observed. Notably , upregulation of the serine ( or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor clade B member 9 gene and downregulation of the Granzyme gene family were observed; the repression of the Granzyme B pathway may be a novel mechanism of immune evasion by cancer cells. The present results provide the basis for further studies on early biomarkers of CC risk and synergistic interactions between HR‑HPV and oestrogen.
