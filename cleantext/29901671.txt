  The reaction of bisphenol A ( BPA) using laboratory synthesized ( Syn-MnOx) and commercially available ( Com-MnOx) MnOx ( s) media<pathogen> was investigated using spectroscopic and aqueous chemistry methods. The surface area of Syn-MnOx ( 128 m2 g-1) and Com-MnOx ( 13.6 m2 g-1) differed by an order of magnitude. The impurities were less than 1 % by weight for Syn-MnOx while Com-MnOx contained 29 % impurity by weight , mainly Al , Si and Fe. The removal of 99.7 % BPA was observed applying Syn-MnOx , while 71.2 % BPA removal was observed applying Com-MnOx after 44 hours of reaction of 10 mM MnOx ( s) media<pathogen> with 1 mM BPA at pH 5.5. The reduction of Mn was detected in the surface of both BPA reacted media , but a higher content of reduced Mn was observed in Syn-MnOx ( 52 % in Syn-MnOx compared to 29 % in Com-MnOx). The release of soluble Mn was an order of magnitude higher in batch experiments reacting BPA with Syn-MnOx compared with Com-MnOx. The C 1s and O 1s XPS high resolution spectral analyses identified the presence of functional groups that likely correspond to BPA oxidation products , such as dimers and quinones associated with MnOx ( s) surfaces on both reacted media. The reaction of BPA with Syn-MnOx fit the electron transfer-limited model ( R2 = 0.96) , while the reaction of BPA with Com-MnOx had a better fit for surface complex formation-limited model ( R2 = 0.95). These results suggest that BPA removal and the reactivity of MnOx ( s) are affected by the differences in surface area and impurities present in these media. Thus , this study has relevant implications for the reaction of MnOx ( s) with emerging organic contaminants in natural biogeochemical processes and water treatment applications.
