  Recent discussions of aetiological overlap between ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD) require comparative studying of these disorders. We examined performance of ASD patients with ( ASD +) and without ( ASD-) comorbid ADHD , ADHD patients , and controls for selected putative endophenotypes of ADHD: Intrasubject Variability ( ISV) of reaction times , working memory ( WM) , inhibition , and temporal processing. We found that patients with ADHD or ASD + , but not ASD- , had elevated ISV across the entire task battery and temporal processing deficits , and that none of the groups were impaired in WM or inhibition. High levels of ISV and generally poor performance in ASD + patients were only partially due to additive effects of the pure disorders. Overall , we conclude that , within our limited but heterogeneous task battery , ISV and temporal processing deficits are most sensitive to ADHD symptomatology and that controlling for ADHD comorbidity is mandatory when assessing ISV in autism.
