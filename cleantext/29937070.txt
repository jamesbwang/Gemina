  Base excision repair ( BER) is the main mechanism to repair endogenous DNA lesions<symptom> caused by reactive oxygen species. BER deficiency is linked with cancer susceptibility and premature aging. Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) within BER genes have been implicated in various human malignancies. Nevertheless , a comprehensive investigation of their association with Wilms tumor susceptibility is lacking. In this study , 145 cases and 531 sex and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. We systematically genotyped 18 potentially functional SNPs in six core BER pathway genes , using a candidate SNP approach. Logistic regression was employed to evaluate odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) adjusted for age and gender. Several SNPs showed protective effects against Wilms tumor. Significant associations with Wilms tumor susceptibility were shown for hOGG1 rs1052133 ( dominant: adjusted OR = 0.66 , 95 % CI = 0.45-0.96 , P = .030) , FEN1 rs174538 ( dominant: adjusted OR = 0.66 , 95 % CI = 0.45-0.95 , P = .027; recessive: adjusted OR = 0.54 , 95 % CI = 0.32-0.93 P = .027) , and FEN1 rs4246215 ( dominant: adjusted OR = 0.55 , 95 % CI = 0.38-0.80 , P = .002) polymorphisms. Stratified analysis was performed by age , gender , and clinical stage. Moreover , there was evidence of functional implication of these significant SNPs suggested by online expression quantitative trait locus ( eQTL) analysis. Our findings indicate that common SNPs in BER genes modify susceptibility to Wilms tumor.
