  Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies. It is necessary to identify new markers for predicting tumor progression and therapeutic molecular targets. It has been reported that CD147 is one of the most commonly expressed proteins in primary tumors and in metastatic cells. In this study , we investigated the role of CD147 in human breast cancer metastasis and invasion , and examined its underlying molecular mechanisms. Immunohistochemistry results revealed high expression of CD147 in human breast tumor tissues , which was positively correlated with the malignancy of breast cancer. MCF-7 cells were transfected with CD147 siRNA eukaryotic expression vector , which resulted in significant knockdown of CD147. We found that CD147 siRNA dramatically inhibited cell proliferation , metastasis , and invasion. Furthermore , our results demonstrated that CD147 siRNA inhibited the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9) but had no significant effect on matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP-2). In addition , CD147 siRNA significantly inhibited the production of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF). Taken together , these data indicate that CD147 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation , metastasis , and invasion by modulating MMP-9 and VEGF expression. Thus , CD147 may be used as an important indicator for the judgment of malignant behavior of breast cancer , and may be a potential novel target for breast cancer therapy.
