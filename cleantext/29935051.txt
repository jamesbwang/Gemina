  The impact of donor quality on post-kidney transplant ( KT) survival may vary by candidate condition. Characterizing this variation would increase access to KT without sacrificing outcomes. We developed a tool to estimate post-KT survival for combinations of donor quality and candidate condition. We studied deceased donor KT recipients ( n = 120 818) and waitlisted candidates ( n = 376 272) between 2005 and 2016 by using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Donor quality and candidate condition were measured by using the Kidney Donor Profile Index ( KDPI) and the Estimated Post Transplant Survival ( EPTS) score. We estimated 5-year post-KT survival based on combinations of KDPI and EPTS score using random forest<disease> algorithms and waitlist survival by EPTS score using Weibull regressions. Survival benefit was defined as absolute reduction in mortality risk with KT. For candidates with an EPTS score of 80 , 5-year waitlist survival was 47.6 % , and 5-year post-KT survival was 78.9 % after receiving kidneys with a KDPI of 20 and was 70.7 % after receiving kidneys with a KDPI of 80. The impact of KDPI on survival benefit varied greatly by EPTS score. For candidates with low EPTS scores ( eg , < 40) , the KDPI had limited impact on survival benefit. For candidates with middle or high EPTS scores ( eg , > 40) , survival benefit decreased with higher KDPI but was still substantial even with a KDPI of 100 ( > 16 percentage points). Our prediction tool ( www.transplantmodels.com/kdpi-epts) can support individualized decision-making on kidney offers in clinical practice.
