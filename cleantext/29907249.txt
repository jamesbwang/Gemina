  Decreased muscle mass is known to be associated with several serious medical conditions. We analyzed the Fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( KNHANES V , 2010-2011) to estimate the heritability of muscle mass in Korean parent-offspring pairs. Cross-sectional. A total of 1233 parents ( average age 57.67 ± 8.50 years) and 917 offspring ( average age 29.10 ± 7.57 years) from 743 families were included in the analysis. Muscle mass was estimated based on three different indices: appendicular skeletal muscle mass ( ASM) measured with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) , weight-adjusted ASM ( SMI) , and height-adjusted ASM ( RASM). The heritability was estimated by employing the maximum-likelihood variance components implemented in Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines ( SOLAR). The best-fitting model was determined out of four polygenic models. Pearson 's partial correlation coefficient was also calculated using the muscle mass indices to further study the association between father or mother and son or daughter pairs. The heritability estimates of the muscle mass indices ranged from 55 % to 80 % ( all p < 0.01). The correlation coefficient of father and offspring ranged from 0.11 to 0.40 , while that of mother and offspring ranged from 0.23 to 0.43 ( all p < 0.01). The heritability estimates of muscle mass in Koreans are large and significant , suggesting that parental muscle mass is an important predictor of the offspring 's muscle mass. The result implies that there may be a genetic factor partly determining muscle mass.
