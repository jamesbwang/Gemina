  The present protocol describes the Conditioned Place Preference ( CPP) as a model of relapse in drug addiction. In this model , animals are first trained to acquire a conditioned place preference in a drug-paired compartment , and after the post-conditioning test , they perform several sessions to extinguish the established preference. The CPP permits the evaluation of the conditioned rewarding effects of drugs related to environmental cues. Then , the extinguished CPP can be robustly reinstated by the non-contingent administration of a priming dose of the drug , and by exposure to stressful stimuli. Both methods will be explained here. When the animal reinitiates the behavioral response , a reinstatement of the conditioned reward is considered to have taken place. The main advantages of this protocol are that it is non-invasive , inexpensive , and simple with good validity criteria. In addition , it allows the study of different environmental manipulations , such as stress or diet , which can modulate relapse into drug seeking behaviors. However , one limitation is that if the researcher aims to explore the motivation and primary reinforcing effects of the drug , it should be complemented with self-administration procedures , as they involve operant responses of animals.
