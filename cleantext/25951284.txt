  Conventional transistor electronics are reaching their limits in terms of scalability , power dissipation , and the underlying Boolean system architecture. To overcome this obstacle neuromorphic analogue systems are recently highly investigated. Particularly , the use of memristive devices in VLSI analogue concepts provides a promising pathway to realize novel bio-inspired computing architectures , which are able to unravel the foreseen difficulties of traditional electronics. Currently , a variety of materials and device structures are being studied along with novel computing schemes to make use of the attractive features of memristive devices for neuromorphic computing. However , a number of obstacles still have to be overcome to cast memristive devices into hardware systems. Most important is a physical implementation of memristive devices , which can cope with the high complexity of neural networks. This includes the integration of analogue and electroforming-free memristive devices into crossbar structures with no additional electronic components , such as selector devices. Here , an unsupervised , bio-motivated Hebbian based learning platform for visual pattern recognition is presented. The heart of the system is a crossbar array ( 16 Ã— 16) which consists of selector-free and forming-free ( non-filamentary) memristive devices , which exhibit analogue I-V characteristics.
