  The public view on antibiotics as reliable medicine has changed when reports about `` resistant superbugs '' shattered the news. While reasons for this development are easily spotted , solutions for re-establishing effective antibiotics are still in their infancy. This review encompasses several aspects of the antibiotic development pipeline from very early strategies to mature drugs. We provide an interdisciplinary overview of methods suitable for mining novel antibiotics and discuss strategies to unravel their modes of action. Select examples of antibiotics recently identified using these platforms not only illustrate the efficiency of these measures , but also highlight promising clinical candidates with therapeutic potential. Furthermore , the concept of molecules that disarm pathogens by addressing gatekeepers of virulence will be covered. We conclude with an evaluation of antibacterials currently in clinical development. Overall , this review aims to connect select innovative antimicrobial approaches to stimulate interdisciplinary partnerships between chemists from academia and industry.
