  Inorganic and organic phosphate controls both primary and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces<pathogen> genus. Metabolism regulation by phosphate in Streptomyces<pathogen> species is mediated by the PhoR-PhoP two-component system. Response regulator PhoP binds to conserved sequences of 11 nucleotides called direct repeat units ( DRus) , whose organization and conservation determine the binding of PhoP to distinct promoters. Streptomyces<pathogen> tsukubaensis is the industrial producer of the clinical immunosuppressant tacrolimus ( FK506). A bioinformatic genome analysis detected several genes with conserved PHO boxes involved in phosphate scavenging and transport , nitrogen regulation , and secondary metabolite production. In this article , the PhoP regulation has been confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA) of the most relevant members of the traditional pho regulon such as the two-component system PhoR-P or genes involved in high-affinity phosphate transport ( pstSCAB) and low-affinity phosphate transport ( pit). However , the PhoP control over phosphatase genes in S. tsukubaensis is significantly different from the pattern reported in the model bacteria Streptomyces coelicolor. Thus , neither the alkaline phosphatase PhoA nor PhoD is regulated by PhoP. On the contrary , the binding of PhoP to the promoter of a novel putative phosphatase PhoX was confirmed. A crosstalk of the PhoP and GlnR regulators , which balances phosphate and nitrogen utilization , also occurs in S. tsukubaensis but slightly modified. Finally , PhoP regulates genes , like afsS , that link phosphate control and secondary metabolite production in S. tsukubaensis. In summary , there are notable differences between the regulation of specific genes of the pho regulon in S. tsukubaensis and the model organism S. coelicolor.
