  In teleost , the structural characteristics of fertilized egg and egg envelope are very important for classification of genus or species. The structures of fertilized egg and egg envelope from Corydoras adolfoi and Corydoras sterbai , Callichthyidae , Siluriformes in teleost were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopes to confirm whether these morphological structures have specificities of species and family or not. The fertilized eggs of C. adolfoi and C. sterbai were non-transparent , spherical , demersal , and strong adhesive. There were no structural differences between two species through the light microscope. The size of the fertilized eggs of C. adolfoi was 1.95 ± 0.03 mm ( n = 20) , and that of C. sterbai was 1.92 ± 0.03 mm ( n = 20). The perivitelline space was almost not developed in both species. In both species , the adhesive protuberances structures were on the outer surface of egg envelope. And fibrous structures were specially located at attachment part of spawning bed. And the egg envelope consisted of two layers , an inner lamellae layer and an outer strong adhesive layer with high electron dense protuberances structures in cross section. Consequentially , the fertilized eggs , outer surface on the egg envelope and cross section of egg envelope have identical structure. So , these structural characteristics of fertilized eggs and egg envelope show genus Corydoras specificity.
