  The widespread use of engineered nanomaterials or nanotechnology makes the characterization of biological responses to nanomaterials an important area of research. The application of omics approaches , such as mass spectrometry-based proteomics , has revealed new insights into the cellular responses of exposure to nanomaterials , including how nanomaterials interact and alter cellular pathways. In addition , exposure to engineered nanomaterials often leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species and cellular oxidative stress , which implicates a redox-dependent regulation of cellular responses under such conditions. In this review , we discuss quantitative proteomics-based approaches , with an emphasis on redox proteomics , as a tool for system-level characterization of the biological responses induced by engineered nanomaterials.
