  Corn appears to be an uncommon food source of allergens in dogs and cats. There is limited information on the nature of the corn allergens in dogs and cats and their presence in the various foodstuffs used in commercial pet foods. The aim of this study was to determine if serum IgE from corn-sensitized dogs and cats recognized proteins in corn flour and cornstarch , which are common sources of carbohydrates in pet foods. We selected archived sera from allergy-suspected dogs ( 40) and cats ( 40) with either undetectable , low , medium or high serum levels of corn-specific IgE. These sera were tested then by ELISA on plates coated with extracts made from corn kernels , corn flour , cornstarch and the starch used in the commercially-available extensively-hydrolyzed pet food Anallergenic ( Royal Canin). Immunoblotting was then performed on the same extracts with some of the sera from moderate-to-high corn-sensitized dogs and cats. Using ELISA , it is mostly the dogs and cats with moderate and high corn-specific IgE levels that also had IgE identifying allergens in the flour ( dogs: 20/30 sera , 67 %- cats: 20/29 , 69 %). In contrast , none of the tested sera had measurable IgE against proteins isolated from the cornstarch. Immunoblotting confirmed the existence of numerous major corn allergens in the corn kernel extract , fewer in that of the corn flour , while such allergens were not detectable using this technique in the two cornstarch extracts. In this study , ELISA and immunoblotting results suggest that IgE from corn-sensitized dogs are less likely to recognize allergens in cornstarch than in kernel and flour extracts. As corn is not a common allergen source in dogs and cats , and as its starch seems to be less allergenic than its flour , pet foods containing cornstarch as a carbohydrate source are preferable for dogs and cats suspected of suffering from corn allergy.
