  An impaired cell-cycle control and genetic material organization are crucial elements of carcinogenesis. p16 is a tumor suppressor protein which decelerates promotion of the cells from G The study was performed on 130 samples of archived invasive ductal breast cancers. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed on freshly prepared tissue microarrays and subsequently scanned by a histologic scanner. Reactions were evaluated separately in the cytoplasm ( p16c , SATB1c) and nucleus ( p16n , SATB1n , Ki-67) with use of a quantification software under researcher supervision. Expression was observed for Ki-67 in 100 % , p16c in 90 % , p16n in 89.2 % , SATB1c in 98.5 % and SATB1n in 87.7 % of cancer cases. Statistical analysis showed strong positive correlations: p16c vs. p16n and SATB1c vs. SATB1n ( p < 0.001 for both) and weak positive correlations: p16c vs. SATB1c and p16c vs. SATB1n ( p = 0.008 , p = 0.027; respectively). Expression of p16n was stronger in G A weak association between immunohistochemical expression of p16 and SATB1 indicated limited possibility of their independent usage. Further studies concerning determination of a wider panel of proteins controlling cell cycle should be considered.
