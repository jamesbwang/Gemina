  The reduction of major lower-extremity amputations ( LEAs) is one of the main goals in diabetes care. Our aim was to estimate annual LEA rates in individuals with and without diabetes in Belgium , and corresponding time trends. Data for 2009-2013 were provided by the Belgian national health insurance funds , covering more than 99 % of the Belgian population ( about 11 million people). We estimated the age-sex standardised annual amputation rate ( first per year) in the populations with and without diabetes for major and minor LEAs , and the corresponding relative risks. To test for time trends , Poisson regression models were fitted. A total of 5438 individuals ( 52.1 % with diabetes) underwent a major LEA , 2884 people with above- and 3070 with below-the-knee major amputations. A significant decline in the major amputation rate was observed in people with diabetes ( 2009: 42.3; 2013: 29.9 per 100,000 person-years , 8 % annual reduction , p < 0.001) , which was particularly evident for major amputations above the knee. The annual major amputation rate remained stable in individuals without diabetes ( 2009: 6.1 per 100,000 person-years; 2013: 6.0 per 100,000 person-years , p = 0.324) and thus the relative risk reduced from 6.9 to 5.0 ( p < 0.001). A significant but weaker decrease was observed for minor amputation in individuals with and without diabetes ( 5 % and 3 % annual reduction , respectively , p < 0.001). In this nationwide study , the risk of undergoing a major LEA in Belgium gradually declined for individuals with diabetes between 2009 and 2013. However , continued efforts should be made to further reduce the number of unnecessary amputations.
