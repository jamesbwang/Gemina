  Infiltration of treated wastewater ( TWW) to recharge depleted aquifers , often referred to as managed aquifer recharge , is a solution to replenish groundwater resources in regions facing water scarcity. We present a mass balance<symptom> approach to infer the amounts of five pharmaceuticals ( carbamazepine , diclofenac , fenoprofen , gemfibrozil , and naproxen) degraded in column experiments based on concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aqueous and solid ( sorbed) phases. Column experiments were conducted under three different conditions: continuous infiltration , wetting and drying cycles , and wetting and drying cycles with elevated concentrations of antibiotics ( which may reduce microbially aided degradation of other compounds). A mass balance<symptom> comparing pharmaceutical mass in the water phase over the 16-month duration of the experiments to mass sorbed to the soil was used to infer the mass of pharmaceuticals degraded. Results show sorption as the main attenuation mechanism for carbamazepine. About half of the mass of diclofenac was degraded with wetting and drying cycles , but no significant degradation was found for continuous infiltration , while 32 % of infiltrated mass sorbed. Fenoprofen was degraded in the shallow and aerobic part of the soil , but degradation appeared to cease beyond 27 cm depth. Gemfibrozil attenuated through a combination of degradation and sorption , with slight increases in attenuation with depth from both mechanisms. Naproxen degraded progressively with depth , resulting in attenuation of > 90 % of the mass. In the column with elevated concentrations of antibiotics , the antibiotics attenuated to about 50 % or less of inflow concentrations by 27 cm depth and within this zone , less degradation of the other compounds was observed.
