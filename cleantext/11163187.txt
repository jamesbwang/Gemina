  The nonsense-mediated messenger RNA ( mRNA) decay ( NMD) pathway is a cellular quality control and post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism and is essential for viability in most multicellular organisms. A complex of proteins has been identified to be required for NMD function to occur; however , there is an incomplete understanding of the individual contributions of each of these factors to the NMD process. Central to the NMD process are three proteins , Upf1 ( SMG-2) , Upf2 ( SMG-3) , and Upf3 ( SMG-4) , which are found in all eukaryotes , with Upf1 and Upf2 being absolutely required for NMD in all organisms in which their functions have been examined. The other known NMD factors , Smg1 , Smg5 , Smg6 , and Smg7 , are more variable in their presence in different orders of organisms and are thought to have a more regulatory role. Here we present the first genetic analysis of the NMD factor
