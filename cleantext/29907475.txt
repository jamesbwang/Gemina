  Langerhans cell histiocytosis ( LCH) is a clonal disease with focal or disseminated lesions<symptom> that may compress the surrounding tissues , including the spinal cord. Because few reports have described the spinal symptoms as the first manifestation of pediatric LCH , the long-term neurological outcomes remain unclear. We report a 21-month-old boy who presented with sudden-onset paraplegia<symptom>. Imaging analyses revealed that osteolytic lesions<symptom> and epidural tumors compressing the spinal cord at the T7-9 vertebrae. Twelve days after he developed leg<symptom> weakness<symptom> , emergency radiotherapy was started after a tumor biopsy. During the course of radiotherapy , paralysis steadily ameliorated. After we excluded infections and determined the pathological diagnosis of LCH , multi-drug chemotherapy was started. Apparent improvement in his complete paraplegia<symptom> was observed after a total 15 Gy of radiotherapy and subsequent chemotherapy , leaving no neurological sequelae at 4 years of age. Through a literature search of studies published from 1980 to 2017 , we found that children with LCH showed a generally favorable recovery from neurological<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> after the acute phase of spinal symptoms. This report underscores the utility of emergency radiotherapy for the neurological recovery of spinal LCH in infants. Our long-term observation further denotes the value of this treatment in terms of the intact survival with preserved motor functions and physical growth.
