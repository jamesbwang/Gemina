  Neonates with congenital heart disease ( CHD) are at high risk of punctate white matter injury ( WMI) and impaired brain development. We hypothesized that WMI in CHD neonates occurs in a characteristic distribution that shares topology with preterm WMI and that lower birth gestational age ( GA) is associated with larger WMI volume. ( 1) To quantitatively assess the volume and location of WMI in CHD neonates across three centres. ( 2) To compare the volume and spatial distribution of WMI between term CHD neonates and preterm neonates using lesion<symptom> mapping. In 216 term born CHD neonates from three prospective cohorts ( mean birth GA: 39 weeks) , WMI was identified in 86 neonates ( UBC: 29; UCSF: 43; UCZ: 14) on pre- and/or post-operative T1 weighted MRI. WMI was manually segmented and volumes were calculated. A standard brain template was generated. Probabilistic WMI maps ( total , pre- and post-operative) were developed in this common space. Using these maps , WMI in the term CHD neonates was compared with that in preterm neonates: 58 at early-in-life ( mean postmenstrual age at scan 32.2 weeks); 41 at term-equivalent age ( mean postmenstrual age at scan 40.1 weeks). The total WMI volumes of CHD neonates across centres did not differ ( p = 0.068): UBC ( median = 84.6 mm WMI in term neonates with CHD occurs in a characteristic topology. The spatial distribution of WMI in term neonates with CHD reflects the expected maturation of pre-oligodendrocytes such that the central regions are less vulnerable than in the preterm neonates.
