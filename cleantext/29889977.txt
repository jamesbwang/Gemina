  The objective of this narrative review was to suggest a rational order of treatment choices in anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) , for whom a multitude of treatment options exist. In obese/overweight women with PCOS the importance of weight reduction should be stressed. Inositol , a dietary supplement with a documented effect on ovulation and without adverse effects in the doses recommended , may be suggested. Additional first-line medical alternatives include insulin sensitizers , selective estrogen receptor modulators , and aromatase inhibitors. Of these , the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and the combination of clomiphene citrate and metformin have the highest rates of ovulation and live birth. Second-line treatments are ovarian electrocautery and low-dose follicle-stimulating hormone stimulation. Controlled ovarian stimulation with in vitro fertilization , should be considered the last option as it carries a significant risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome<disease> in patients with PCOS.
