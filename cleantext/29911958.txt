  This paper investigates the trajectories of depression<symptom> symptoms in adolescents and young adults , and explores factors associated with their depression<symptom> For each respondent , three waves of data were collected in 2006 , 2009 and 2013 from adolescents and young adults aged 10 to 24 years. The modified Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression<symptom> Scale was used to interview participants , while the generalised estimating equation ( GEE) model was used to identify whether certain factors were associated with depression<symptom> The mean depression<symptom> scores in 2006 , 2009 and 2013 were 29.76 , 30.80 and 30.51 respectively. Compared to boys , girls reported higher initial levels of depressive symptoms. The depression<symptom> score was found to be highest among adolescents aged 15 to 17 years. Depression<symptom> among young people was associated with age , gender , marital status , education levels , general health and living location. Using longitudinal design , this research demonstrated the different trajectories of depression<symptom> scores between boys and girls over time and provided evidence for interventions improving adolescent mental health in a semi-urban area of Vietnam.
