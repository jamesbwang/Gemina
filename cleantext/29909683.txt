  Endometrial carcinoma is the fourth most common cancer affecting women in the UK. Its most frequent sites of spread are to the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes , vagina and peritoneum. We report a case of a 63-year-old woman with known endometrial cancer who presented with left facial swelling and eye displacement. Investigations revealed an expansile soft-tissue density mass arising within the bone , centred on the left zygoma , with exophytic extension into the left maxillary antrum , infratemporal fossa and inferiorly into the orbit. Endoscopic biopsies were taken and histology confirmed metastatic deposits of endometrial cancer. Clinicians should be aware that distant spread of endometrial cancer is linked with advanced disseminated disease and palliative treatments should be considered.
