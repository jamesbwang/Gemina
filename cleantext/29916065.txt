  Growth and replication of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> within host cell entail the production of several effector proteins , which the parasite exploits for counteracting the host 's immune response. Despite considerable research to define the host signaling pathways manipulated by T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> and their effectors , there has been limited progress into understanding how individual members of the dense granule proteins ( GRAs) modulate gene expression within host cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> GRA15 protein plays any role in regulating host gene expression. Baby hamster kidney cells ( BHK-21) were transfected with plasmids encoding GRA15 genes of either type I GT1 strain ( GRA15
