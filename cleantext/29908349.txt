  To perform a meta-analysis for assessing the accuracy of diffusion kurtosis imaging ( DKI)- derived quantitative parameters ( kurtosis values , K; and corrected diffusion coefficients non-Gaussian bias , D) in separating malignant cancers from benign lesions<symptom>. Relevant studies were searched in PubMed and Cochrane Library databases and were analyzed by Meta-DiSc software. Fourteen eligible studies involving 1847 lesions<symptom> in 1107 patients ( 895 were benign and 952 were malignant) were included. Pooled analysis showed the sensitivity , specificity , positive likelihood ratio ( LR) , and negative LR were respectively 0.83 ( 95 % CI , 0.79-0.85) , 0.83 ( 95 % CI , 0.80-0.86) , 4.61 ( 95 % CI , 2.98-7.14) , and 0.22 ( 95 % CI , 0.18-0.28) for K , with the overall area under curve ( AUC) of 0.89. The sensitivity , specificity , positive LR , and negative LR were 0.85 ( 95 % CI , 0.80-0.88) , 0.85 ( 95 % CI , 0.79-0.89) , 6.39 ( 95 % CI , 3.14-12.99) , and 0.18 ( 95 % CI , 0.14-0.23) for D , with the overall AUC of 0.92. The sensitivity , specificity , positive LR , and negative LR for apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) derived from standard diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI) were 0.82 ( 95 % CI , 0.79-0.84) , 0.85 ( 95 % CI , 0.82-0.88) , 4.75 ( 95 % CI , 3.38-6.68) , and 0.24 ( 95 % CI , 0.19-0.29) , with the overall AUC of 0.89. The superiority of D to K and ADC was also confirmed by the subgroup analysis of prostate cancer. Our findings suggest that DKI should be added to the routine imaging protocol for screening cancer , with the highest diagnostic accuracy of diffusion coefficients.
