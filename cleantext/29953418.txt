  Facial photoaging has become a major cosmetic concern , and the microneedle fractional radiofrequency system ( MFRS) is a novel method for rejuvenation that combines radiofrequency and microneedles. This study prospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of an MFRS in the treatment of facial photoaged skin in Chinese patients. Twenty-seven patients with moderate facial photoaging were recruited and received 3 treatments at 4-week intervals. Blinded clinical assessment was performed by 2 independent dermatologists on a 5-point global photoaging scale ( GPS). Patients were also questioned on the extent of improvement of rhytides , skin tightening , and complexion with a 4-point global aesthetic improvement scale ( GAIS) and satisfaction based on a 5-point scale. Adverse events and pain scores were also evaluated. Compared with the baseline , there was a significant improvement in facial photoaged skin after 3 treatments , and these positive outcomes were maintained up to the 6-month follow-up , according to the GPS and GAIS scores. Most patients were satisfied with the treatment and reported mild to moderate<symptom> pain<symptom> and adverse effects. This MFRS is effective for facial skin rejuvenation in Chinese patients. The therapy also seems safe and well tolerated.
