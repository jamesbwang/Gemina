  Scattering structure factors provide essential insight into material properties and are routinely obtained in experiments , computer simulations , and theoretical analyses. Different approaches favor different geometries of the material. In case of lipid bilayers , scattering experiments can be performed on spherical vesicles , while simulations and theory often consider planar membrane patches. We derive an approximate relationship between the structure functions of such a material in planar and spherical geometries. We illustrate the usefulness of this relationship in a case study of a Gaussian material that supports both homogeneous and microemulsion phases. Within its range of applicability , this relationship enables a model-free comparison of structure factors of the same material in different geometries.
