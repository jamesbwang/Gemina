  In-plane heterojuctions formed from two monolayer semiconductors represent the finest control of electrons in condensed matter and have attracted significant interest. Various device studies have shown the effectiveness of such structures to control electronic processes , illustrating their potentials for electronic and optoelectronic applications. However , information about the physical mechanisms of charge carrier transfer across the junctions is still rare , mainly due to the lack of adequate experimental techniques. Here we show that transient absorption measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution can be used to directly monitor such transfer processes. We studied MoS
