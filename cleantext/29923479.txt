  ABSTRACTObjectives: To understand pathways to suicide by investigating the association between personality and suicidal motivations in mid- and late-life attempts. In a two-study approach , we measured different components of suicidal motivations using an existing self-report investigating reasons for suicide and a semi-qualitative assessment of motivational states preceding attempts. Inpatient and outpatient psychiatric services in Pittsburgh , PA.. Study 1 ( n = 50 , mean age at attempt = 60.4) was a smaller sample of suicide attempters included in Study 2 ( n = 69 , mean age at attempt = 60.9). Non-psychiatric healthy controls ( n = 50 , mean age = 67.1) were used as benchmarks for dispositional measures. Motives for suicide were measured by the Reasons for Attempting Suicide Questionnaire ( RASQ). Participants ' written descriptions of the thoughts and feelings preceding their attempt captured motivational states. Measures of personality for both studies included assessments of impulsivity , five-factor model , interpersonal dysfunction , and borderline traits. In study 1 , escape/self-punishment motives on the RASQ were associated with multiple attempts and borderline pathology , while interpersonal motives were less frequently endorsed and associated with poorly planned attempts. In study 2 , experiences of defeat ( i.e. powerlessness , poor coping to threats to autonomy/status) were more frequently endorsed by men and associated with disagreeableness. Study 1 revealed that attempters high in dysfunctional psychopathology were more likely to report self-oriented escape motives for suicide , while study 2 identified a putative pathway to suicide in men involving antagonism and the experience of defeat.
