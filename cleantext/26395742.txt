  The present study aimed to investigate whether microRNA-27a ( miRNA27a) is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy , and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of any potential association. In retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE) cells treated with high glucose , miRNA27a expression , determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis , was decreased. Caspase-3/ 9 activity and B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X ( Bax) protein expression was increased in RPE cells subjected to high glucose. Inhibition of miRNA27a suppressed the viability , and increased the caspase-3/ 9 activity and Bax protein expression of RPE cells treated with high glucose. Inhibition of miRNA27a expression also increased the expression of interleukin ( IL) -6 , IL-1β , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α and Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) in RPE cells treated with high glucose. Treatment with immunostimulatory ( is) RNA directed against TLR4 was observed to inhibit caspase-3/ 9 activity , decrease the expression of TLR4 , Bax , IL-6 , IL-1β and TNF-α , and increase the viability of RPE cells subjected to high glucose following the inhibition miRNA27a. In conclusion , the results of the present study suggest that miRNA27a protects RPE cells subjected to high glucose via inhibiting inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis through targeting TLR4.
