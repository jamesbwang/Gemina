  We aimed to investigate the effect of smoking on the risk of intracranial aneurysm<disease> ( IA) rupture ( IAR) , specifically relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day ( CPD) or smoking index and the risk of IAR. We performed a single-center case-control study of consecutive patients evaluated or treated for IA at our institution from June 2015 to July 2016. Cases were patients with a ruptured IA. Two age- and sex-matched controls with an unruptured IA were included per case. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between both the CPD and smoking index ( CPD Ã— years of smoking) and IAR. The study population included 127 cases of IAR and 254 controls. The higher IAR risk was associated with cigarette smoking ( both current and former) ( OR , 2.3; 95 % CI , 1.1-4.8; A dose-response relationship has been noted for intensity and duration of smoking consumption and increased risk of IAR. As smoking is modifiable , this finding is important to managing patients with IAs to quit or reduce smoking prior to life-threatening subarachnoid
