  Patient navigation is a practice strategy to address barriers to timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of varying intensities of patient navigation and timely diagnostic resolution after abnormal mammography. This is a secondary analysis of a subset of women with an abnormal screening or diagnostic mammogram who participated in the `` patient navigation in medically underserved areas '' 5-year randomized trial. We compared timely diagnostic resolution in women assigned to different intensities of patient navigation including , full navigation intervention , no contact with navigators , or limited contact with navigators. The sample included 1,725 women with abnormal mammogram results. Women who interacted with patient navigators had significantly fewer days to diagnostic resolution after abnormal mammography compared with women who did not interact with patient navigators. Results from our study suggest that even limited contact with navigators encourages women to seek more timely diagnostic resolution after an abnormal mammogram , which may offer a low-cost practice strategy to improve timely diagnosis for disadvantaged and underserved women.
