  We introduce individual component maps of rotatory strength ( ICM-RS) and rotatory strength density ( RSD) plots as analysis tools of chiro-optical linear response spectra deriving from time-dependent density functional theory ( TDDFT) simulations. ICM-RS and RSD allow one to visualize the origin of chiro-optical response in momentum or real space , including signed contributions and therefore highlighting cancellation terms that are ubiquitous in chirality phenomena , and should be especially useful in analyzing the spectra of complex systems. As test cases , we use ICM-RS and RSD to analyze circular dichroism spectra of selected ( Ag-Au)
