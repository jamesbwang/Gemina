  This study aimed to evaluate the effect on oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL) of two treatment protocols for dental fluorosis in individuals enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. Seventy volunteers , who lived in a fluorosis endemic area in Brazil , and had at least four maxillary anterior teeth showing fluorosis with a Thylstrup and Fejerskov index from 1 to 7 , were randomized into two treatment groups ( n = 35): GI- enamel microabrasion; or GII- microabrasion associated with at-home bleaching. Microabrasion was performed using 37 % phosphoric acid and pumice , and at-home tooth bleaching with 10 % carbamide peroxide in a tray. Volunteers completed a questionnaire at baseline and 1-month post treatment to assess changes in OHRQoL , using the Oral Impact on Daily Performance ( OIDP). Differences in overall impact scores between and within treatment groups were analyzed with Wilcoxon ( within) and Mann-Whitney ( between) tests. Changes in performance scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon tests ( a < 0.05). One month after treatment , subjects reported improvement in OHRQoL. Both groups showed lower OIDP scores ( p < 0.001) , but there was no difference between them. Eating , cleaning teeth , smiling and emotional state performance scores were lower after treatment for the whole sample. In conclusion , the treatment with microabrasion improved the OHRQoL in this sample of individuals living in a fluorosis endemic area regardless of the addition of at-home bleaching.
