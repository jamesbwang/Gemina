  Recent studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphisms in the mechanisms contributing to the development of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Here we tested the hypothesis that microglia might preferentially regulate hyperalgesic priming in male mice. We based this hypothesis on evidence that microglia preferentially contribute to neuropathic pain in male mice via ionotropic purinergic receptor ( P2XR) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38) signaling. Mice given a single-priming injection of the soluble human interleukin-6 receptor ( IL-6r) and then a second injection of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE
