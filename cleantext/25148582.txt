  Emerging opportunities based on two-dimensional ( 2D) layered structures can utilize a variety of complex geometric architectures. Herein , we report the synthesis and properties of a 2D +0 D unique ternary platform-core-shell nanostructure , termed Ag@Cu ₂ O-rGO , where the reduced graphene oxide ( rGO) 2D acting as a platform is uniformly decorated by Ag@Cu ₂ O core-shell nanoparticles. Cu ₂ O nanoparticles occupy the defect positions on the surface of the rGO platform and restore the conjugation of the rGO structure , which contributes to the significant decrease of the
