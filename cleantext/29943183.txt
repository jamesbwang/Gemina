  To evaluate the correlation between tumour differentiation or stage of gallbladder cancer ( GBC) and the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) , as well as to assess whether ADC value can predict long-term disease-free survival ( DFS) after surgery. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Between March 2008 and June 2016 , 79 patients who underwent magnetic resonance ( MR) imaging with diffusion-weighted image and subsequent surgery for GBC were included in this study. Correlations between quantitative ADC values and tumour differentiation or stage based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC) were assessed using Spearman 's correlation analysis. Prognostic factors for DFS were identified with multivariate Cox regression analysis using imaging and clinical characteristics. All patients were classified as having well- ( n = 18) , moderately ( n = 35) or poorly differentiated GBCs ( n = 26). The ADC value of GBCs was significantly correlated with tumour differentiation and AJCC stage ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , respectively). Sixty-nine patients were followed up for 2.0-92.4 months ( median , 23.5 months). On multivariate analysis , the significant prognostic factor for DFS was not tumour differentiation or AJCC stage but a binary tumour ADC value ( hazard ratio , 4.29; p = 0.009). DFS rates were significantly different according to the classification of tumour ADC value ( cut-off value = 1.04 × 10 The ADC value of GBCs was significantly correlated with tumour differentiation as well as AJCC stage. In addition , it predicted long-term outcomes after surgery in patients with GBC. • ADC values of GBC and tumour differentiation were negatively correlated. • Lower<symptom> ADC values of GBC were significantly correlated with higher tumour stage. • Tumour ADC value could be useful for risk stratification of GBC patients.
