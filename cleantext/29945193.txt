  The emergence of robust single-cell ` omics techniques enables studies of uncultivable species , allowing for the ( re) discovery of diverse genomic features. In this study , we combine single-cell genomics and transcriptomics to explore genome evolution in ciliates , a > 1 billion year old clade. Analysis of the data resulting from these single-cell ` omics approaches show: 1) the description of the ciliates in the class Karyorelictea as ` primitive ' is inaccurate because their somatic macronuclei contain loci of varying copy number ( i.e. they have been processed by genome rearrangements from the zygotic nucleus); 2) gene-sized somatic chromosomes exist in the class Litostomatea , consistent with Balbiani 's 1890 observation of giant chromosomes in this lineage; and 3) gene scrambling exists in the underexplored Postciliodesmatophora ( the classes Heterotrichea and Karyorelictea , abbreviated here as the Po-clade) , one of two major clades of ciliates. Together these data highlight the complex evolutionary patterns underlying germline genome architectures in ciliates and provide a basis for further exploration of principles of genome evolution in diverse microbial lineages.
