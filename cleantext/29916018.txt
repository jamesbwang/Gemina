  Ribonucleic acid ( RNA) homeostasis is dynamically modulated in response to changing physiological conditions. Tight regulation of RNA abundance through both transcription and degradation determines the amount , timing , and location of protein translation. This balance<symptom> is of particular importance in neurons , which are among the most metabolically active and morphologically complex cells in the body. As a result , any disruptions in RNA degradation can have dramatic consequences for neuronal health. In this chapter , we will first discuss mechanisms of RNA stabilization and decay. We will then explore how the disruption of these pathways can lead to neurodegenerative disease.
