  Domino liver transplantation ( DLT) utilizes the explanted liver of one liver transplant recipient as a donor graft in another patient. While there may be unique risks associated with DLT , it is unclear if DLT has less favorable long-term outcomes than deceased donor liver transplantation ( DDLT). We used a propensity score matching approach to compare the outcomes of DLT recipients to DDLT recipients. The United Network for Organ Sharing ( UNOS) registry was queried for patients undergoing DLT or DDLT in 2002-2016. Each DLT recipient was matched to a unique DDLT recipient to compare mortality and graft failure. There were 126 DLT and 62 835 DDLT recipients meeting inclusion criteria. After propensity score matching on recipient pre-transplant characteristics , 123 DLT cases were matched to DDLT controls from the same UNOS region. On stratified Cox proportional hazards regression , DLT incurred no increase in the hazard of mortality ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.4; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.8 , 2.7; P = 0.265) or graft failure ( HR = 1.2; 95 % CI: 0.7 , 2.1; P = 0.556) compared to DDLT. Using a large national registry , a propensity-matched analysis found no increased risk of mortality or graft failure associated with DLT compared to DDLT.
