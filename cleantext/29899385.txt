  To describe rates of prediabetes among youth in Canada and the associated social and biological characteristics. We analyzed the cross-sectional data from the first ( 2007-2009) and second ( 2009-2011) cycles of the Canadian Health Measures Survey ( CHMS) for youth aged 6-19 years. Prediabetes was defined using the glycated hemoglobin ( A1C) guidelines set out by the American Diabetes Association ( ADA) and the Canadian Diabetes Association ( CDA) of A1C ranges 5.7-6.4 % ( 38.8-46.4 mmol/mol) and 6.0-6.4 % ( 42.1-46.4 mmol/mol) , respectively. An elevated A1C was observed in 22.8 % of our sample ( n = 3449) based on the ADA definition and 5.2 % of youth using the CDA definition. Independent predictors in a fully adjusted model for prediabetes were non-White ( odds ratio ( OR) 2.62: 95 % Confidence intervals 2.05-3.35) , obese ( OR 1.53: 1.19-1.96) , less physically active youth ( 0.97: 0.95-0.99) , and parents with high school education or less ( 1.34: 1.02-1.74). Moreover , significant regional variations were noted with higher rates for all regions except Ontario. Prediabetes is relatively common in Canada and associated with common biologic and socioeconomic factors. Importantly , regular physical activity was significantly associated with reduced odds of prediabetes. Targeted screening and continued emphasis on physical activity may help curb the increasing rates of prediabetes.
