  To examine whether falls are associated with the subsequent ability to work among workers 65 years and older. This longitudinal cohort study followed older workers enrolled in the Health and Retirement Study. Outcomes included time to health-related work limitation and to labor force exit. After adjustment multiple falls with or without a medically-treated injury were associated with time to limitation ( HR = 1.77 , 95 % CI: 1.30-2.40; HR = 1.48 , 95 % CI: 1.26-1.73 , respectively). Adjustment mitigated a crude relationship between falls and time to exit. Significant interactions suggest the relationship between falls and labor force exit depends on age , race and job demands. Falls , both non-injurious and injurious , are associated with subsequent health-related work limitation among workers 65 and older. Fall prevention activities would benefit workers who want or need to keep working past age 65.
