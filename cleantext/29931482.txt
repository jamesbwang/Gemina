  Obesity is related to increased cardiovascular risk. It is unknown whether increasing levels of obesity also increase levels of cardiovascular risk factors and systemic inflammation<symptom>. This study describes the relationship between classic cardiovascular risk factors and inflammatory markers with BMI in a group of obese and non-obese subjects. Obese subjects ( BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m The obese group included more women and subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and current smoking behavior. In obese subjects , HDL-C and triglycerides decreased with increasing BMI. Systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , total cholesterol , LDL-C , and apoB were not related to BMI in the obese group , in contrast to the non-obese group. Inflammatory markers CRP , leukocyte count , and serum complement C3 increased with increasing BMI in the obese group , while these relations were less clear in the non-obese group. The subcutaneous adipose tissue surface was positively correlated to BMI , while no correlation was observed between BMI and visceral adipose tissue. Markers of inflammation<symptom> are strongest related to BMI in obese subjects , most likely due to increased adipose tissue mass , while cardiovascular risk factors do not seem to deteriorate above a certain BMI level. Limited expansion capacity of visceral adipose tissue may explain these findings.
