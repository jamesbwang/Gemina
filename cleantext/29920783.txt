  Overweight and obesity are multifactorial diseases caused by an imbalance in energy metabolism. An underlying genetic predisposition is often a factor in these conditions. In the cat breeding family of the Institute of Animal Nutrition at the Vetsuisse Faculty , University of Zurich , a segregating overweight phenotype with a genetic contribution was observed. From this breeding family , 26 kittens were followed from birth up to 8 months of age. During this time , food intake was measured using an automatic feeding station , and energy expenditure was investigated using indirect calorimetry at the ages of 4 and 6 months. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA) was performed and blood glucose , leptin and insulin were measured at the ages of 4 , 6 and 8 months. The kittens were also weighed daily for the first 2 weeks of life , every second day until weaning and once per week until 8 months of age. The body condition score ( BCS) was evaluated monthly between 2 and 8 months of age. The main finding of this study is that a predisposition to overweight is connected to a higher food intake early in life , with no significant alterations in energy expenditure. The leptin blood levels were related to body fat percentage , and insulin sensitivity did not seem to be affected.
