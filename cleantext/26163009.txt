  The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the limbal stem cells in corneal epithelial homeostasis in patients with peripheral corneal disease who received corneal transplantation surgery. This retrospective study enrolled 85 patients ( 85 eyes) with peripheral corneal lesion<symptom> who underwent corneal transplantation at Department of Ophthalmology in First Hospital of Jilin University , Jilin , China. All patients during each follow-up period were examined for best corrected visual acuity , corneal reconstruction ( assessed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy) , anterior segment optical coherence tomography , and confocal microscopy. Patients were followed up for 3.5 Â± 2.4 years. All patients had improved postoperative best corrected visual acuity. Neither vascularization nor conjunctivalization of the graft occurred. Scanning of the graft was covered by normal corneal epithelium as confirmed on the laser scanning
