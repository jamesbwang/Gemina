  In this report , we designed and synthesized polyacrylonitrile/silver ( PAN/AgNPs) nanofibers via an in-situ method to obtain a washable with high-dispersed silver nanoparticles membrane to form the hierarchically organized antibacterial mask to prevent the two-way effect of bacteria from person to environment and environment to person. For this objective , the electrospun PAN nanofibers were stabilized via the heating method. Different amounts of AgNPs were loaded into the PAN nanofibers by using silver nitrate and sodium hydroxide solutions. The basic results showed that AgNPs was homogenously loaded in PAN nanofiber matrixes. Furthermore , the release profile based on two-stage release theory showed that when the negligible amount of AgNPs was loaded into the nanofibers , the release significantly decreased , whereas antibacterial activity increased. The greatest potential antibacterial activity of the lowest amount of AgNPs showed controllable AgNPs release from PAN nanofibers that has a direct relationship with the washability and could promote the application of the produced product.
