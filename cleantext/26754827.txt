  In this paper , we propose , design and test a new dual-nuclei RF-coil inspired by wire metamaterial structures. The coil operates as a result of resonant excitation of hybridized eigenmodes in multimode flat periodic structures comprising several coupled thin metal strips. It was shown that the field distribution of the coil ( i.e. penetration depth) can be controlled independently at two different Larmor frequencies by selecting a proper eigenmode in each of two mutually orthogonal periodic structures. The proposed coil requires no lumped capacitors to be tuned and matched. In order to demonstrate the performance of the new design , an experimental preclinical coil for
