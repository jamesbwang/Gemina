  Both insufficiency and excess of one-carbon nutrients ( folate , choline , vitamins B6 and B12) during pregnancy have been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM). However , the precise nature of this association has not been clearly established. We hypothesized that GDM may affect one-carbon nutrients concentrations in the fetus , thus possibly participating in epigenetic programing of the offspring. Maternal blood was collected at recruitment ( 12-16 weeks). At delivery ( 28-42 weeks) , both maternal and cord blood were collected. Blood concentrations of one-carbon nutrients and their metabolites were compared between the two groups. A total of 368 women were included in the study , of whom 19 ( 5.6 %) were later diagnosed with GDM. No significant differences were found in maternal blood concentrations of one-carbon nutrients and their metabolites between the GDM and control groups at recruitment or at delivery. In cord blood , however , serum folate ( 87.7 ( IQR 70.4-103.9) vs 66.6 ( IQR 45.5-80.3) nmol/L , P = .025) and plasma TMAO ( 2.82 ( IQR 1.3-3.2) vs 1.35 ( IQR 1.0-2.0) μmol/L , P = .017) concentrations were higher , while plasma betaine concentrations were lower ( 17.5 ( IQR 16.3-19.4) vs 21.1 ( IQR 18.0-24.1) μmol/L , P = .019) in infants born to mothers with GDM compared with control. Our data suggest that while maternal blood concentrations of one-carbon nutrients and their metabolites may not affect the risk of GDM , GDM may alter concentrations of serum folate , plasma betaine and TMAO in cord blood. These alterations in one-carbon nutrient concentrations in fetal circulation may impact epigenetic programing , thereby contributing to physiologic changes and disease susceptibility in adulthood associated with GDM offspring.
