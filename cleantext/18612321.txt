  Animal mitochondrial genomes typically encode 37 genes: 13 proteins , 22 tRNAs and two rRNAs. However , many species represent exceptions to that rule. Bivalvia along with Nematoda and Platyhelminthes are often suspected to fully or partially lack the ATP synthase subunit 8 ( Here we demonstrate that Many organisms ( e.g. , Bivalvia along with Nematoda and Platyhelminthes) are considered to be lacking certain mitochondrial genes often only based on poor similarity between protein coding gene sequences in genetically closed species. In some situations , this may lead to the inference that the ATP8 gene is absent , when it is in fact present , but highly divergent. This shows how important complementary role protein-based approaches , such as those in the present study , can provide to bioinformatic , genomic studies ( i.e. , ability to confirm the presence of a gene).
