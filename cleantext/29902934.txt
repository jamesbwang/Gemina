  At the center of Alzheimer 's disease pathogenesis is the aberrant aggregation of amyloid-β ( Aβ) into oligomers , fibrils and plaques. Effective monitoring of Aβ deposition directly in patients is essential to assist anti-Aβ therapeutics in target engagement and participant selection. In the advent of approved anti-Aβ therapeutics , biomarkers will become of fundamental importance in initiating treatments having disease modifying effects at the earliest stage. Two well-established Aβ biomarkers are widely utilized: Aβ-binding ligands for positron emission tomography and immunoassays to measure Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid. In this review , we will discuss the current clinical , diagnostic and research state of biomarkers for Aβ pathology. Furthermore , we will explore the current application of blood-based markers to assess Aβ pathology.
