  Renin-angiotensin system blockade ( RAB) is the cornerstone in the management of patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , the benefit of RAB in patients with accompanying severe renal impairment is not clear. We aimed to examine the effect of RAB and the differential effect of RAB depending on renal replacement ( RR) in patients with severe renal insufficiency and acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Among 5625 patients from the Korean Acute<symptom> Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> registry , 673 in-hospital survivors ( 70.9 Â± 12.8 years , 376 men) who had left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % and estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1 .73 m Early RAB treatment in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and severe renal insufficiency was related to better prognosis. The benefit of RAB was particularly prominent in patients receiving RR therapy.
