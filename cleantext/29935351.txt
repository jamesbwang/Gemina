  Chagas ' disease and leishmaniasis<disease> are parasitic infections enrolled among the neglected tropical diseases , which urge for new treatments. In the search for new chemical entities as prototypes , gibbilimbols A/B have shown antiparasitic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum , and then a set of analogues ( LINS03 series) of this natural product were synthesized and evaluated in vitro against the parasites. In the present paper we reported five new compounds with activity against these protozoan parasites , and quite low cytotoxicity. Moreover , the interference of plasma membrane permeability of these analogues were also evaluated. We found that ( ( 4-methoxyphenyl) methyl) octylamine ( 4) was noteworthy due to its high activity against the amastigote form of both parasites ( IC
