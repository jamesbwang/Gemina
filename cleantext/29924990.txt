  Pancreatitis<disease> is an inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> of the exocrine pancreas and ranks among the most common gastrointestinal disorders. Inflamed tissues frequently experience conditions of insufficient oxygen availability , or hypoxia. Here , we demonstrate that hypoxia and consequent stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ( HIF1α) transcription factor occur in murine and human pancreatitis<disease> Mice lacking pancreas-specific HIF1α expression display markedly impaired pancreatic regeneration following cerulein-induced pancreatitis<disease> , which is associated with excessive intrapancreatic B cell accumulation. Notably , B cell depletion in mice with established pancreatitis<disease> significantly enhances tissue regeneration. Our study reveals a crosstalk between pancreatic HIF1α expression and B cell trafficking that regulates tissue regeneration , and identifies plausible molecular targets for treating pancreatitis<disease> patients.
