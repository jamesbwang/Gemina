  Osimertinib is efficacious in lung cancer patients with epidermal growth factor receptor ( Serum/plasma from Thirteen patients were included. Median time on osimertinib treatment was 10.6 months with a median progression-free survival of 13.6 months. Best response to osimertinib was partial response ( PR) , stable disease ( SD) or progression ( PD) in 46.1 % , 30.8 % and 23.1 % of patients , respectively.Most of the patients were paucisymptomatic at baseline. Symptom improvement was reported in 66.6 % of responder patients; while symptoms remained stable in 75 % of patients with SD , and 66 % of patients with PD had clinical deterioration.Three patterns of T790M changes during osimertinib treatment were identified. T790 remained detectable with PD or a short-lasting SD in 15.4 % of the patients. T790M disappeared in 69.2 % of patients with PR or SD. T790M disappeared , despite clinical and/or radiographic progression in 15.4 % of the patients. Changes of T790M in serum/plasma in
