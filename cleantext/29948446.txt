  Peritoneal dialysis ( PD) and hemodialysis ( HD) are options for the treatment of acute kidney injury ( AKI) patients. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of PD and daily HD on respiratory mechanics of AKI patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation ( IMV). A prospective cohort study evaluated 154 patients , 37 on continuous PD and 94 on HD. Respiratory mechanics parameters such as pulmonary static compliance ( Psc) and resistance of the respiratory system ( Rsr) and oxygenation index ( OI) were assessed for 3 days. Patients were evaluated at moments 1 , 2 and 3 ( pre- and post-dialysis). The initial clinical parameters were similar in the two groups , except the age that was higher in continuous PD group ( 70.8 ± 11.6 vs. 60 ± 15.8; p < 0.0001). In both groups , Psc increased significantly , with no difference between the two groups-pre-dialysis ( continuous PD 40 ± 17.4 , 42.8 ± 17.2 , 48 ± 19; HD 39.1 ± 21.3 , 39. 5 ± 18.9 , 45.2 ± 21) and post-dialysis ( continuous PD 42.8 ± 7.2 , 48 ± 19 , 57.1 ± 18.3; HD 42 ± 19 , 45 ± 18.5 , 56 ± 24.8). Rsr remained stable among patients on continuous PD ( pre-dialysis 10.4 ± 5.1 , 13.3 ± 7.7 , 13.5 ± 10.3 , post-dialysis 13.3 ± 7.7 , 13.5 ± 10.3 , 11.1 ± 5.9) and decreased among HD patients ( pre-dialysis 10.4 ± 5.1 , 10.4 ± 5.1 , 10.4 ± 5 , 1 , post-dialysis 10.5 ± 6.8 , 10 ± 4.9 , 8.9 ± 4.2). There was difference in Rsr between the two groups at the post-dialysis moments 1 and 2 ( p = 0.03). OI increased in both groups ( continuous PD 260.7 ± 119 , 252.7 ± 87.1 , 287.3 ± 88.4; HD 228 ± 85 , 257 ± 84 , 312.1 ± 111.5 , p > 0.05) , although there was no difference between them. AKI patients undergoing IMV and HD or PD had improvement in the mechanical ventilation and oxygenation , with no difference between the two groups.
