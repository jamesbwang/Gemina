  To assess antenatal care ( ANC) coverage and analyse constraining factors for service delivery to rural settled and mobile populations in two districts in Chad. Data from cross-sectional household and health facility surveys in the two Chadian rural health districts were analysed. First , contact coverage of ANC services in the study area was estimated from household data as the proportion of women who visited health facilities to obtain ANC during their last pregnancy. Second , bottlenecks in the provision of this service were explored by calibrating a multiplicative model of ANC contact coverage to household and health facility data. The model allowed quantification of the magnitude by which coverage decreased as it progressed through the health system. Sensitivity analysis was applied to account for uncertainty around the estimated coverage factors. Direct estimates revealed that ANC contact coverage decreased as the number of required visits increased: 79 % of rural settled mothers and 46 % of mobile pastoralist mothers visited a health facility to obtain ANC at least once ( ANC 1). Among mobile pastoralists , only 20 % of pregnant women attended ANC at least three times compared to 63 % of rural settled women. Availability , accessibility , affordability and acceptability contributed to reductions in service coverage in both populations. For mobile pastoralists , acceptability was clearly the most important factor. ANC 1 contact coverage resulting from the model is 50 % for rural settled and 30 % for mobile pastoralists. Antenatal care coverage was low in rural districts of Chad , particularly for mobile pastoralists. Acceptability largely explained the prevailing difference between the two population groups.
