  Tubercular gummas and splenic tuberculomas are rare forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis<disease> , usually occurring in immunocompromised individuals. We hereby report a rare combination of multiple tubercular gummas and splenic tuberculoma secondary to TB lymphadenitis<disease> in an immunocompetent individual. The patient responded to antitubercular therapy. Thus , in a developing country like ours , tuberculosis<disease> can present in a wide clinical spectrum even in an immunocompetent individual.
