  Bio-cellulose is the microbial extracellular cellulose that is produced by growing several microorganisms on agriculture by-products , and it is used in several food applications. This study aims to utilize sago by-product , coconut water , and the standard medium Hestrin-Schramm as the carbon sources in the culture medium for bio-cellulose production. The bacteria Beijerinkia fluminensis WAUPM53 and Gluconacetobacter xylinus 0416 were selected based on their bio-cellulose production activity. The structure was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy , while the toxicity safety was evaluated by brine shrimp<disease> lethality test. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the bio-cellulose produced by B. fluminensis cultivated in sago by-products was of high quality. The bio-cellulose production by B. fluminensis in the sago by-product medium was slightly higher than that in the coconut water medium and was comparable with the production in the Hestrin-Schramm medium. Brine shrimp<disease> lethality test confirmed that the bio-cellulose produced by B. fluminensis in the sago by-product medium has no toxicity , which is safe for applications in the food industry. This is the first study to determine the high potential of sago by-product to be used as a new carbon source for the bio-cellulose production.
