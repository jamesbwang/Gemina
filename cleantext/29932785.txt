  Myasthenia gravis ( MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder with no cure and conventional treatments limited by significant adverse effects and variable benefit. In the last decade , therapeutic development has expanded based on improved understanding of autoimmunity and financial incentives for drug development in rare disease. Clinical subtypes exist based on age , gender , thymic pathology , autoantibody profile , and other poorly defined factors , such as genetics , complicate development of specific therapies. Areas covered: Clinical presentation and pathology vary considerably among patients with some having weakness<symptom> limited to the ocular muscles and others having profound generalized weakness<symptom> leading to respiratory insufficiency. MG is an antibody-mediated disorder dependent on autoreactive B cells which require T-cell support. Treatments focus on elimination of circulating autoantibodies or inhibition of effector mechanisms by a broad spectrum of approaches from plasmapheresis to B-cell elimination to complement inhibition. Expert commentary: Standard therapies and those under development are disease modifying and not curative. As a rare disease , clinical trials are challenged in patient recruitment. The great interest in development of treatments specific for MG is welcome , but decisions will need to be made to focus on those that offer significant benefits to patients.
