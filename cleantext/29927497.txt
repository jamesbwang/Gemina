  The development of new tools to improve the quality of NMR spectra is a challenging task. The concept of `` perfect NMR '' includes the design of robust pulse sequences that allow an investigator to obtain undistorted pure in-phase signals , with pure absorption lineshapes that are free of phase anomalies derived from undesired J modulations. The spin-echo is a fundamental tool in NMR spectroscopy allowing J evolution while Î´ effects are refocused and , therefore , potentially contributing to these phase distortions. Here , a series of alternative NMR building blocks to the spin-echo that are based on a general double spin-echo module , known as a perfect-echo , are reviewed. Several implementations to minimize/remove unwanted dispersive contributions in homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR experiments are described and illustrated with some examples of broad interest for small molecules.
