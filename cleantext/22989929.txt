  Radiation exposure severely damages the hematopoietic system. Although several radio-protectors have been proposed to prevent radiation-induced damage , most agents have limited efficacy. In the present study , we investigated whether mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) could contribute to the expansion of hematopoietic cells and mitigate radiation-induced hematopoietic injury in vitro and in vivo. We found that co-culture with MSCs promoted hematopoietic progenitor/stem cell ( HPSCs) maintenance by providing a bone marrow-like microenvironment. In addition , we showed that MSCs prevented radiation-induced damage to HPSCs , as evidenced by the lack of DNA damage and apoptosis. Intravenously injected MSCs rapidly migrated to the bone<disease> marrow ( BM) and prevented loss of BM cellularity , which reduced lethality and ameliorated pancytopenia in the BM of whole body-irradiated mice. We demonstrated that MSC-derived Jagged1 attenuated radiation-induced cytotoxicity of HPSCs , and that this was mediated by Notch signaling and expression of downstream proteins Bcl2 and p63 in HPSCs. In addition , Notch2 depletion significantly reduced the MSC-mediated radio-protective effect in human- and mouse-derived HPSCs. Collectively , our data show that activation of Notch and its associated downstream signaling pathways prevent radiation-induced hematopoietic injury. Therefore , enhancing Jagged1-Notch2 signaling could provide therapeutic benefit by protecting the hematopoietic system against damage after radiation.
