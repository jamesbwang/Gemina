  Cd1d is a member of the cluster of differentiation 1 ( CD1) family of glycoproteins expressed on the surface of various antigen-presenting cells , which is recognized by natural killer T ( NKT) cells. CD1d-dependent NKT cells play an important role in immune-mediated diseases; but the role of these cells in regulating cardiac remodeling remains unknown. Cardiac remodeling was induced by angiotensin ( Ang) II infusion for 2 weeks. Ang II-induced increase in hypertension , cardiac performance , hypertrophy and fibrosis<disease> , inflammatory response and activation of the NF-kB and TGF-β1/ Smad2/3 pathways was significantly aggravated in CD1d knockout ( CD1dko) mice compared with wild type ( WT) mice , but these effects were markedly abrogated in WT mice treated with α-galactosylceramide ( αGC) , a specific activator of NKT cells. Adoptive transfer of CD1dko bone<disease> marrow cells to WT mice further confirmed the deleterious effect of CD1d knockout. Moreover , IL-10 expression was significantly decreased in CD1dko hearts but increased in αGC-treated mice. Co-culture experiments revealed that CD1dko dentritic cells ( DCs) significantly reduced IL-10 mRNA expression from NKT cells. Administration of recombinant murine IL-10 to CD1dko mice improved hypertension , cardiac performance and adverse cardiac remodeling induced by Ang II , and its cardioprotective effect was possibly associated with activation of STAT3 , and inhibition of the TGF-β1 and NF-kB pathways. These findings revealed a previously undefined role for CD1d-dependent NKT cells in Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling , hence activation of NKT cells may be a novel therapeutic target for hypertensive cardiac disease.
