  Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Background Decreased psychological readiness for sport contributes to poor return to sport rates after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR). Advanced ACLR rehabilitation is used to improve functional readiness for sport , but the effect on psychological readiness is unknown. Objective To examine changes in psychological and functional measures , and readiness for sport based on these measures , in patients with ACLR following advanced group training. Methods Patients with primary ACLR enrolled in a 5-week group training program after completing traditional physical therapy. Data collection pre- and post-training included demographic information , Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sports after Injury ( ACL-RSI) questionnaire , and single leg hop testing ( single , triple , crossover triple , and timed hops). Readiness for sport was based on criteria for ACL-RSI score ( low threshold: ≥ 56 points , high threshold: ≥ 75 points) and hop tests ( ≥ 90 % limb symmetry). Results Fifty-eight patients ( 21 males) participated. Mean ACL-RSI scores , mean hop test limb symmetry , and the proportion of patients meeting ACL-RSI and hop test readiness for sport criteria significantly improved pre- to post-training. Post-training ACL-RSI scores were correlated with single hop ( r = .269) and triple hop ( r = .275) limb symmetry , yet changes in the measures were not significantly correlated. Post-training , only 53.4 % ( lower ACL-RSI threshold) or 37.9 % ( higher ACL-RSI threshold) of the sample met both psychological and functional readiness criteria. Conclusions Advanced group training following ACLR improved psychological and functional outcomes; however , further , individualized intervention may be needed to address residual deficiencies is some patients.
