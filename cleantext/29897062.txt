  The performance of novel two-dimensional nitrides in carbon capture and storage ( CCS) is analyzed for a broad range of pressures and temperatures. Employing an integrated theoretical framework where CO2 adsorption/desorption rates on the M2N ( M = Ti , Zr , Hf , V , Nb , Ta , Cr , Mo , and W) surfaces are derived from transition state theory and density functional theory based calculations , the present theoretical simulations consistently predict that , depending on the particular composition , CO2 can be strongly adsorbed and even activated at temperatures above 1000 K. For practical purposes , Ti2N , Zr2N , Hf2N , V2N , Nb2N , and Ta2N are predicted as the best suited materials for CO2 activation. Moreover , the estimated CO2 uptake of 2.32-7.96 mol CO2 kg-1 reinforces the potential of these materials for CO2 abatement.
