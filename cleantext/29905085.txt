  Following radioiodine ( RI) therapy , oxidative stress is a putative damage mechanism resulting in salivary gland ( SG) dysfunction. Since ginseng is a known anti-oxidative herb , we examined the SG radioprotective effects of Korea red ginseng ( KRG) in a mouse model , when administered prior to RI. Four-week-old mice ( n = 60) were divided into four groups: ( 1) normal control , ( 2) RI only treated ( 0.01 mCi/g , orally) , ( 3) KRG administered ( 0.2 mg/g , intraperitoneal injection) 0.5 and 24 hours before RI , and ( 4) amifostine-treated group ( 0.2 mg/g , intraperitoneally) 0.5 hour before RI. The salivary lag times and flow rates were assessed , and sampled tissues were subjected to histologic examinations including hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining. Apoptosis was examined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUDP nick end labeling ( TUNEL) assay , and excretion changes in salivary The body<symptom> weight of the KRG group was similar to the control group. Salivary lag times and flow rates in the RI + KRG group were faster than in the RI only group. There was no significant intergroup difference in the SG weight. The RI + KRG group exhibited more mucin-containing parenchyma and less fibrotic tissues than the RI only group. Salivary epithelial ( aquaporin 5) and myoepithelial ( smooth muscle actin) cells of the RI + KRG group were protected from radiation damage. Low 8-OhdG ( oxidative stress biomarker) and high superoxide dismutase 2 ( reactive oxygen species scavenger) immunostaining reactivity was detected in the RI + KRG group when compared with the RI only group. Fewer apoptotic cells were observed in the RI + KRG or amifostine group compared to the RI only group in the TUNEL assay. The Pretreatment with KRG before RI therapy is potentially beneficial in protecting against RI-induced salivary dysfunction.
