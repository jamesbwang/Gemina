  Electrocardiographic mapping ( ECM) expresses electrical substrate through magnitude and direction of the activation delay vector ( ADV). We investigated to what extent the response to cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) is determined by baseline ADV and by ADV modification through CRT and optimization of left ventricular ( LV) pacing site. ECM was performed in 79 heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients ( 4 RBBB , 12 QRS < 120 ms , 23 non-specific conduction delay ( NICD) and 40 left bundle branch block ( LBBB)). 67 patients ( QRS ≥ 120 ms) underwent CRT implantation and in 26 patients multiple LV pacing site optimization was performed. ADV was calculated from locations/depolarization times of 2000 virtual epicardial electrodes derived from ECM. Acute response was defined as ≥ 10 % LVdP/dt During intrinsic conduction , ADV direction was similar in patients with QRS < 120 ms , NICD and LBBB , pointing towards the LV free wall , while ADV magnitude was larger in LBBB ( 117 ± 25 ms) than in NICD ( 70 ± 29 ms , P < 0.05) and QRS < 120 ms ( 52 ± 14 ms , P < 0.05). Intrinsic ADV accurately predicted the acute ( AUC = 0.93) and chronic ( AUC = 0.90) response to CRT. ADV change by CRT only moderately predicted response ( highest AUC = 0.76). LV pacing site optimization had limited effects: +3 ± 4 % LVdP/dt The baseline electrical substrate , adequately measured by ADV amplitude , strongly determines acute and chronic CRT response , while the extent of its modification by conventional CRT or by varying LV pacing sites has limited effects.
