  To describe the mean of systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP) , and the prevalence of hypertension among 6-17 years old children and adolescents in China in 2010-2012. Data was from the China Nutrition and Health Surveillance in 2010-2012. The total number was 35 657 which selected through the method of multi-stage stratified cluster randomization sampling and probability proportion to size ( PPS). The study objects were 6-17 years old childrenand adolescents in 31 Provinces and 150 sites in China Mainland. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was measured by mercury sphygmomanometer. Hypertension was defined using Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> reference standards for Chinese children and adolescents ( 2010). Age-standardized result were calculated incorporating a sample weighting using the national census from the National Bureau of Statistics in 2009. The overall mean SBP was 101 mmHg. It was 102 mmHg for boys and 99 mmHg for girls. It showed 94 mmHg and 105 mmHg in 6-11 and 12-17 age groups. The mean DBP was 65 mmHg. Both boys and girls were 65 mmHg. It was 61 mmHg and 68 mmHg in 6-11 and 12-17 age groups. The prevalence of hypertension was 12. 4 % in children and adolescents in China. It was 12. 4 % in boys and 12. 3 % in girls. It showed 7. 3 % in 6-11 age group and 15. 6 % in 12-17 group. The SBP , DBP and prevalence of hypertension were increased with age. The mean SBP of poor rural area was lowest and there was no difference in SBP and hypertensive prevalence. The government should pay more attention on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and hypertension in 6-17 years old children and adolescents. It is important to strengthen the surveillance and early detection and prevention.
