  In the United States , diabetes has increased rapidly , exceeding prior predictions. Projections of the future diabetes burden need to reflect changes in incidence , mortality , and demographics. We applied the most recent data available to develop an updated projection through 2060. A dynamic Markov model was used to project prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among US adults by age , sex , and race ( white , black , other). Incidence and current prevalence were from the National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS) 1985-2014. Relative mortality was from NHIS 2000-2011 follow-up data linked to the National Death Index. Future population estimates including birth , death , and migration were from the 2014 Census projection. The projected number and percent of adults with diagnosed diabetes would increase from 22.3 million ( 9.1 %) in 2014 to 39.7 million ( 13.9 %) in 2030 , and to 60.6 million ( 17.9 %) in 2060. The number of people with diabetes aged 65 years or older would increase from 9.2 million in 2014 to 21.0 million in 2030 , and to 35.2 million in 2060. The percent prevalence would increase in all race-sex groups , with black women and men continuing to have the highest diabetes percent prevalence , and black women and women of other race having the largest relative increases. By 2060 , the number of US adults with diagnosed diabetes is projected to nearly triple , and the percent prevalence double. Our estimates are essential to predict health services needs and plan public health programs aimed to reduce the future burden of diabetes.
