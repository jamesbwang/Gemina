  The behaviour of ionic solutions confined in nanoscale gaps is central to countless processes , from biomolecular function to electrochemistry , energy storage and lubrication. However , no clear link exists between the molecular-level behaviour of the liquid and macroscopic observations. The problem mainly comes from the difficulty to interrogate a small number of liquid molecules. Here , we use atomic force microscopy to investigate the viscoelastic behaviour of pure water and ionic solutions down to the single ion level. The results show a glassy-like behaviour for pure water , with single metal ions acting as lubricants by reducing the elasticity of the nano-confined solution and the magnitude of the hydrodynamic friction. At small ionic concentration ( < 20 mM) the results can be quantitatively explained by the ions moving via a thermally-activated process resisted by the ion 's hydration water ( Prandtl-Tomlinson model). The model breaks down at higher salt concentrations due to ion-ion interaction effects that can no longer be neglected. The correlations are confirmed by direct sub-nanometre imaging of the interface at equilibrium. The results provide a molecular-level basis for explaining the tribological properties of aqueous solutions and suggest that ion-ion interactions create mesoscale effects that prevent a direct link between nanoscale and macroscopic measurements.
