  Avian blood parasites , including Plasmodium<pathogen> spp. and Haemoproteus spp. , are found worldwide but only limited information of their occurrence is available in the Republic of Korea ( ROK). We determined the prevalence of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus and their phylogenetic characteristics in wild birds in ROK. Blood samples were collected from 118 wild birds of 27 species in the Chonbuk Province , ROK. While 43 ( 36 %) were positive for avian haemosporidia on microscopic examination of blood smears , 53 ( 45 %) were positive by PCR targeting the cytochrome b gene. By direct sequencing of PCR amplicons , 47 ( 89 %) were identified as Haemoproteus spp. and 6 ( 11 %) as Plasmodium<pathogen> spp.. Phylogenetic analysis using the cytochrome b gene revealed that resident and migrant birds have very similar genetic lineages of both parasites in ROK , suggesting the possibility that migrant birds may act as a mediator for the parasite among Asian countries.
