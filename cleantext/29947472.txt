  Long-standing research has shown that increased lipid content in donor livers is associated with inferior graft outcomes posttransplant. The global epidemic that is obesity has increased the prevalence of steatosis in organ donors , to the extent that it has become one of the main reasons for declining livers for transplantation. Consequently , it is one of the major culprits behind the discrepancy between the number of donor livers offered for transplantation and those that go on to be transplanted. Steatotic livers are characterized by poor microcirculation , depleted energy stores because of an impaired capacity for mitochondrial recovery , and a propensity for an exaggerated inflammatory response following reperfusion injury culminating in poorer graft function postoperatively. Ex situ machine perfusion , currently a novel method in graft preservation , is showing great promise in providing a tool for the recovery and reconditioning of marginal livers. Hence , reconditioning these steatotic livers using machine perfusion has the potential to increase the number of liver transplants performed. In this review , we consider the problematic issues associated with fatty livers in the realm of transplantation and discuss pharmacological and nonpharmacological options that are being developed to enhance recovery of these organs using machine perfusion and defatting strategies.
