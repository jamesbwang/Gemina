  Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD) is an important manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis , with diabetes being one of its most significant risk factors. Owing to medial arterial calcification ( MAC) , the ankle-brachial index ( ABI) is not always a reliable tool for detecting PAD. Arterial Doppler flow parameters , such as systolic maximal acceleration ( ACCmax) and relative pulse slope index ( RPSI) , may serve as effective surrogates to detect stenosis-induced flow alteration. In the present study , ACCmax and RPSI were prospectively evaluated in 166 patients ( 304 arteries) with clinical suspicion of PAD , including 76 patients with and 90 patients without diabetes. In the overall sample , the sensitivity of ACCmax ( 69 %) was superior to that of ABI ( 58 %) and RPSI ( 56 %). In patients with diabetes , the sensitivity of ACCmax ( 57 %) , ABI ( 56 %) and RPSI ( 57 %) were similar , though a parallel test taking both ACCmax and RPSI into account further increased sensitivity to 68 %. The specificity ( 98 %) and accuracy ( 78 %) of ACCmax were superior to those of ABI ( 83 % and 70 % , respectively) , as were the specificity ( 95 %) and accuracy ( 77 %) of RPSI in patients with diabetes. The diagnostic properties of ACCmax and RPSI were superior to those of ABI for detecting PAD in patients with diabetes. Our acceleration algorithm ( Gefäßtachometer ®) provides a rapid , safe , noninvasive tool for identifying PAD in patients with diabetes.
