  Attention has been paid to the environmental distribution and fate of nanomedicines. However , their effects on the toxicity of environmental pollutants are lack of knowledge. In this study , the negatively charged poly ( ethylene glycol)- b-poly ( L-lactide-co-glycolide) ( mPEG-PLA) and positively charged polyethyleneimine-palmitate ( PEI-PA) nanomicelles were synthesized and served as model drug carriers to study the interaction and combined toxicity with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT). DDT exerted limited effect on the biointerfacial behavior of mPEG-PLA nanomicelles , whereas it significantly mitigated the attachment of PEI-PA nanomicelles on the model cell membrane as monitored by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation ( QCM-D). The cytotoxicity of DDT towards NIH 3T3 cells was greatly decreased by either co-treatment or pre-treatment with the nanomicelles according to the results of real-time cell analysis ( RTCA). The cell viability of NIH 3T3 exposed to DDT was increased up to 90 % by the co-treatment with mPEG-PLA nanomicelles. Three possible reasons were proposed: ( 1) decreased amount of free DDT in the cell culture medium due to the partitioning of DDT into nanomicelles; ( 2) mitigated cellular uptake of nanomicelle-DDT complexes due to the complex agglomeration or electrostatic repulsion between complexes and cell membrane; ( 3) detoxification effect in the lysosome upon endocytosis of nanomicelle-DDT complexes.
