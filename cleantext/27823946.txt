  Clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion<pathogen> of the corpus callosum ( MERS) is a recently identified clinically and radiologically distinct syndrome.<pathogen> Clinical symptoms and lesions<pathogen> on the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) often disappear in 1 week or a few weeks. However , MERS manifesting as a severe clinical course with significant sequela has not yet been reported. A 42-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of headache<pathogen> , fever<pathogen> , and irrational speech. Physical examination showed a body temperature of 39.5 Â°C , dysarthria<pathogen> , dyscalculia , recent memory disturbance , and otherwise normal vital signs. The patient developed status epilepticus and progressive consciousness<pathogen> disturbance. MRI showed abnormal patchy signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The clinical feature and the characteristic of MRI are mostly consistent with MERS. At the same time , we made a differential diagnosis by testing the NMDARAb , AMPA1Ab , AMPA2Ab , LG1Ab , CASPR2Ab , GABABRAb in CSF and serum. The subject was treated with ganciclovir , antiepileptic , and antipyretic therapy. The subject was living a virtually normal life with persistent mild memory disturbance. MRI showed that the abnormal signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum had disappeared , but hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR imaging was noted in the centrum semiovale. MERS is a rare clinicoradiological syndrome<pathogen> , which can manifest as severe<pathogen> symptoms<pathogen> as well. Early diagnosis and treatment should be emphasized , and the diagnostic value of MRI is highlighted. Clinicians should be alert to the potential sequela.
