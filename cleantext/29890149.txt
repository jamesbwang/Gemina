  A combination of hypoplasia of the left side of the heart , a hypoplastic aortic arch , a large patent ductus arteriosus , and valvular pulmonary stenosis is very rare. The severity of the valvular pulmonary stenosis in this setting is difficult to judge preoperatively. Here , we describe a newborn with borderline hypoplasia of the left side of the heart , a hypoplastic aortic arch , a large patent ductus arteriosus , and valvular pulmonary stenosis , who underwent the Norwood procedure successfully. The purpose of this report is to share the perioperative course of the patient and our decision-making process that was not straightforward.
