  Objective The study aimed to investigate the role of high Kr√ºppel-like factor 5 ( KLF5) expression on the pathogenesis of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lungs ( CCAML) in mice. Methods A mouse model of high KLF5 expression in the lungs was established. KLF5 expression and the pulmonary lumen diameter were examined by immunohistochemistry to determine a successful model. Basement membrane damage and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9) were examined. After an adenovirus<pathogen> carrying KLF5 gene transfection in lung adenocarcinoma ( H441) was created , changes in expression and activity of MMP-9 were determined. Results In a mouse model with high KLF5 expression , the pulmonary lumen was markedly enlarged , indicating establishment of CCAML. The basement membrane was degraded , and MMP-9 activity was significantly higher in the model group compared with the control group. Moreover , mice in a cellular model after transfection also showed higher MMP-9 activity than did controls. Conclusion High KLF5 expression may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CCAML , partly through regulating the activity of MMP-9.
