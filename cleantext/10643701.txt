  DNA vaccines have recently emerged as a therapeutic agent for treating autoimmune diseases , such as multiple sclerosis. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome<disease> ( APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by β2-glycoprotein I ( β2-GPI)- targeting antiphospholipid antibodies ( APAs) and vascular thrombosis or obstetrical complications. To examine the therapeutic potential of a β2-GPI DNA vaccine , we administered a vaccine mixed with FK506 as an adjuvant to a mouse model of obstetric APS. First , the pCMV3-β2-GPI DNA vaccine , which encodes the full-length human β2-GPI gene , was constructed. Then , we administered the β2-GPI DNA vaccine in 0.1 ml of saline , mixed with or without 100 μg of FK506 , intramuscularly to the mice on days 28 , 35 and 42. Blood titers of the anti-β2-GPI antibody , platelet counts , activated partial thromboplastin times ( aPTTs) , and the percentage of fetal loss were measured. We also stimulated murine splenic T cells ex vivo with β2-GPI and determined the T helper cell proportion and cytokine secretion. The administration of the β2-GPI DNA vaccine mixed with FK506 reduced the blood IgG anti-β2-GPI antibody titers and suppressed APS manifestations in mice. The combination also suppressed interferon-γ and interleukin ( IL) -17 A secretion but increased the Treg cell proportion and IL-10 secretion in murine splenic T cells following ex vivo stimulation with β2-GPI. Our results demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of a β2-GPI DNA vaccine and FK506 as an adjuvant in a murine model of obstetric APS. Possible mechanisms include the inhibition of Th1 and Th17 responses and the up-regulation of Treg cells.
