  The growing use of crowdsourced geographic information ( CGI) has prompted the employment of several methods for assessing information quality , which are aimed at addressing concerns on the lack of quality of the information provided by non-experts. In this work , we propose a taxonomy of methods for assessing the quality of CGI when no reference data are available , which is likely to be the most common situation in practice. Our taxonomy includes 11 quality assessment methods that were identified by means of a systematic literature review. These methods are described in detail , including their main characteristics and limitations. This taxonomy not only provides a systematic and comprehensive account of the existing set of methods for CGI quality assessment , but also enables researchers working on the quality of CGI in various sources ( e.g. , social media , crowd sensing , collaborative mapping) to learn from each other , thus opening up avenues for future work that combines and extends existing methods into new application areas and domains.
