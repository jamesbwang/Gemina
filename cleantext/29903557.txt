  Three-dimensional ( 3D) volume-rendered images allow 3D insight into the anatomy , facilitating surgical treatment planning and teaching. 3D printing , additive manufacturing , and rapid prototyping techniques are being used with satisfactory accuracy , mostly for diagnosis and surgical planning , followed by direct manufacture of implantable devices. The major limitation is the time and money spent generating 3D objects. Printer type , material , and build thickness are known to influence the accuracy of printed models. In implant dentistry , the use of 3D-printed surgical guides is strongly recommended to facilitate planning and reduce risk of operative complications.
