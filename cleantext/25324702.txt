  The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of additional canals in the first permanent molars of the participants of Saudi , Jordanian , and Egyptian population using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT). In this retrospective study , CBCT scans of 139 patients were collected who were implant treated at College of Dentistry , Al Jouf University , Saudi Arabia , from October 2016 to March 2017. The images were analyzed using On-Demand 3D software. A pilot study was done to prevent intra-examiner error , and two calibrated examiners independently assessed 20 % randomly selected CBCT images. Gender and racial disparities were analyzed using Chi-square test. The prevalence of additional canal in U16 , U26 , L36 , and L46 of Saudi population was 41.80 % , 41.80 % , 17.30 % , and 19.10 % , respectively. In Jordanian participants , no additional canals were found in both mandibular first molars whereas only one participant from Egypt had additional canal in both mandibular first molars. Moreover , significant associations were found between L36 ( In conclusion , the results of this study provide the information about the prevalence of additional canal in the first permanent molars , which will help and guide the clinicians while performing root canal treatment and also may help them increase the success rate of root canal treatment of the first permanent molars.
