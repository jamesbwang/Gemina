  The rupture of oil gland reservoirs housed near the outer surface of the citrus exocarp is a common experience to the discerning citrus consumer and bartenders the world over. These reservoirs often rupture outwardly in response to bending the peel , which compresses the soft material surrounding the reservoirs , the albedo , increasing fluid pressure in the reservoir. Ultimately , fluid pressure exceeds the failure strength of the outermost membrane , the flavedo. The ensuing high-velocity discharge of oil and exhaustive emptying of oil gland reservoirs creates a method for jetting small quantities of the aromatic oil. We compare this jetting behavior across five citrus hybrids through high-speed videography. The jetting oil undergoes an extreme acceleration to reach velocities in excess of 10 m/s. Through material characterization and finite element simulations , we rationalize the combination of tuned material properties and geometries enabling the internal reservoir pressures that produce explosive dispersal , finding the composite structure of the citrus peel is critical for microjet production.
