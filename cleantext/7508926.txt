  We previously identified novel bioactive polysaccharides from Bactrocera cucurbitae and Antheraea yamamai that activate innate immunity in RAW264 murine macrophages. However , in terms of potential applications in the cultivation of prawns<disease> , there were problems with the availability of these insects. However , we have now identified a polysaccharide from Bombyx mori that activates innate immunity in RAW264 cells and penaeid prawns<disease>. This purified polysaccharide , termed silkrose of B. mori ( silkrose-BM) , has a molecular weight of 1,150,000 and produces a single symmetrical peak on HPLC. Eight of nine constitutive monosaccharides of silkrose-BM are concomitant with dipterose of B. cucurbitae ( dipterose-BC) and silkrose of A. yamamai ( silkrose-AY). The major differences are found in the molar ratios of the monosaccharides. Silkrose-BM is approximately 500-fold less potent than silkrose-AY ( EC
