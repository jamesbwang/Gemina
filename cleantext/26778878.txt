  Real-time visualization of fine details ranging to 100 um or less in neuro-vascular imaging guided interventions is important. A separate high-resolution detector mounted on a standard flat panel detector ( FPD) was previously reported. This device had to be rotated mechanically into position over the FPD for high resolution imaging. Now , the new detector reported here has a high definition ( Hi-Def) zoom capability along with the FPD built into one unified housing. The new detector enables rapid switching , by the operator between Hi-Def and FPD modes. Standard physical metrics comparing the new Hi-Def modes with those of the FPD are reported , demonstrating improved imaging resolution and noise capability at patient doses similar to those used for the FPD. Semi-quantitative subjective studies involving qualitative clinician feedback on images of interventional devices such as a Pipeline Embolization Device ( PED) acquired in both Hi-Def and FPD modes are presented. The PED is deployed in a patient specific 3D printed neuro-vascular phantom embedded inside realistic bone and with tissue attenuating material. Field-of-view ( FOV) , exposure and magnification were kept constant for FPD and Hi-Def modes. Static image comparisons of the same view of the PED within the phantom were rated by expert interventionalists who chose from the following ratings: Similar , Better , or Superior. Generally , the Hi-Def zoomed images were much preferred over the FPD , indicating the potential to improve endovascular procedures and hence outcomes using such a Hi-Def feature.
