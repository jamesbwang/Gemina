  To present the histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of pituitary lactotroph adenomas ( PLAs) resistant to dopamine agonist treatment. The investigators examined paraffin-embedded blocks and histological sections obtained from 19 patients ( 13 women , 6 men) , whose median age was 29 ( 19 , 38) years , after surgical treatment ( adenomectomy) for PLAs resistant to dopamine agonist treatment. Immunohistological examination was performed using antibodies against prolactin ( PRL) , growth hormone ( GH) , thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH) , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH) , luteinizing hormone ( LH) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH) , type 2 dopamine receptors ( DR The expression of PRL by adenoma cells was revealed in all the patients. The coexpression of PRL and GH without clinical and laboratory signs of acromegaly was established in 3 cases. No expression of TSH , ACTH , LH , or FSH was revealed in any cases. Positive immunoreaction using antibodies against DR PLAs resistant to dopamine agonists in addition to PRL ( 100 %) can express GH in 16 % of cases are characterized by the immunoexpression of DR
