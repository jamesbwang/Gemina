  Fluid overload ( FO) is associated with unfavorable outcomes in critically ill children. Clinicians are encouraged to avoid FO; however , strategies to avoid FO are not well-described in pediatrics. Our aim was to implement a bundle strategy to prevent FO in children with sepsis<disease> and pARDS and to compare the outcomes with a historical cohort. A quality improvement initiative , known as preemptive fluid strategy ( PFS) was implemented to prevent early FO , in a 12-bed general PICU. Infants on mechanical ventilation ( MV) fulfilling pARDS and sepsis<disease> criteria were prospectively recruited. For comparison , data from a historical cohort from 2015 , with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria , was retrospectively reviewed. The PFS bundle consisted of 1. maintenance of intravenous fluids ( MIVF) at 50 % of requirements; 2. drug volume reduction; 3. dynamic monitoring of preload markers to determine the need for fluid bolus administration; 4. early use of diuretics; and 5. early initiation of enteral feeds. The historical cohort treatment , the standard fluid strategy ( SFS) , were based on physician preferences. Peak fluid overload ( PFO) was the primary outcome. PFO was defined as the highest FO during the first 72 h. FO was calculated as ( cumulative fluid input- cumulative output)/ kg * 100. Fluid input/output were registered every 12 h for 72 h. Thirty-seven patients were included in the PFS group ( 54 % male , 6 mo ( IQR 2,11)) and 39 with SFS ( 64 % male , 3 mo ( IQR1 ,7)). PFO was lower in PFS ( 6.31 % ( IQR4.4-10)) compared to SFS ( 12 % ( IQR8.4-15.8)). FO was lower in PFS compared to CFS as early as 12 h after admission ( 2.4 ( 1.4,3.7) v/s 4.3 ( 1.5,5.5) , p < 0.01) and maintained during the study. These differences were due to less fluid input ( MIVF and fluid boluses). There were no differences in the renal function test. PRBC requirements were lower during the first 24 h in the PFS ( 5 %) compared to SFS ( 28 % , p < 0.05). MV duration was 81 h ( 58,98) in PFS and 118 h ( 85154) in SFS ( p < 0.05). PICU LOS in PFS was 5 ( 4 , 7) and in SFS was 8 ( 6 , 10) days. Implementation of a bundle to prevent FO in children on MV with pARDS and sepsis<disease> resulted in less PFO. We observed a decrease in MV duration and PICU LOS. Future studies are needed to address if PFS might have a positive impact on health outcomes.
