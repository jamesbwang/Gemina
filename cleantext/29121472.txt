  This work investigates the influence of ammonium ions and the organic load ( chemical oxygen demand ( COD)) on the UV/chlorine AOP regarding the maintenance of free available chlorine ( FAC) and elimination of 16 emerging contaminants ( ECs) from wastewater treatment plant effluent ( WWTE) at pilot scale ( UV chamber at 0.4 kW). COD inhibited the FAC maintenance in the UV chamber influent at a ratio of 0.16 mg FAC per mg COD (
