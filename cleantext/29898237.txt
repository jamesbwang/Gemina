  Eating disorders are prevalent in the pediatric population yet underdiagnosed by pediatric health care professionals. The gold standard of care consists of a multidisciplinary team approach including a therapist , registered dietitian nutritionist ( RDN) , and psychiatrist , combined with family-centered treatment. Although families do not cause eating disorders , they are essential to a child 's recovery from an eating disorder. Psychoeducation , supportive limit setting , processing relational dynamics , and externalizing the eating disorder are therapeutic interventions used in the treatment of an eating disorder. The RDN provides assessment , education , and guidance with food and nutrition , as well as establishing goal weight and implementing meal plans. Over time , the RDN assists with integrating the patient and family into their normal lifestyle , including guiding adjustments in the meal plan for weight maintenance , increasing activity , dining out , and increasing the variety of foods consumed. Psychopharmacological interventions help target comorbid psychiatric conditions but should be used in conjunction with other therapeutic interventions to effectively treat pediatric eating disorders.
