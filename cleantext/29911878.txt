  Although some literature reviews cited mixed results for group-based social competence interventions in schools , existing descriptions of intervention efficacy often lack attention on important factors that may moderate differential response. Some studies suggest that individual characteristics such as diagnosis ( i.e. , specific deficit clusters) or behavioral profiles may be important social outcome moderators. Given the interactive nature of group-based interventions , understanding how individual characteristics combine to influence outcomes for the group as a whole is an important next step. By using a multisite cluster randomized control trial ( n = 274) , the current study explores the impact that varying student characteristics have on outcomes of the Social Competence Intervention for Adolescents ( SCI-A; Stichter , Herzog , Owens , & Malugen , 2016; Stichter et al. , 2010) compared to outcomes of business-as-usual ( BAU) practices. Researchers hypothesized that ( a) SCI-A would be more effective than BAU in improving ratings of students ' social functioning when students within groups were more similar to each other on relevant diagnostic and behavioral indicators , and ( b) that within SCI-A only , more versus less homogenous groups would demonstrate greater social outcome gains. Results offer some support for these hypotheses: SCI-A was more effective in improving social communication and motivation when groups were diagnostically similar ( ds > 0.55). Considering changes in social awareness and communication , SCI-A was more effective when groups were heterogeneous on socially competent behavior ( ds > 1.32) and less effective when groups were heterogeneous on antisocial behavior ( ds > 1.00). The authors discuss the implications and importance of research exploring factors such as group composition that may moderate intervention response in applied settings. ( PsycINFO Database Record
