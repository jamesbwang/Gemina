  Pancreatic lipidosis ( nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease , NAFPD) causes insulin resistance and dysfunction of pancreatic Î²-cells , with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). However , the prevalence and pathogenic factors associated with NAFPD are not clear. The aim of the study was to explore the prevalence of NAFPD in a Chinese adult population , and investigate factors associated with NAFPD aggravation.This was a cross-sectional study; 4419 subjects were enrolled for NAFPD screening and were divided into NAFPD ( n = 488) and without NAFPD ( n = 3930) groups. The sex , age , related concomitant diseases , general physical parameters , and serum glucose and lipid metabolism were compared between the 2 groups.The overall NAFPD prevalence was 11.05 % , but increased with age. In those < 55 years NAFPD prevalence was lower in females than males ( P < .05) , but prevalence was similar > 55 years. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) , T2DM , homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index , total cholesterol , triglyceride , lipoprotein , adiponectin , and glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1) were the independent risk factors for NAFPD ( P < .05). Analaysis of mild NAFPD ( MN) and severe NAFPD ( SN) subgroups , according to the extent of fat deposition , suggested that NAFLD , triglyceride , lipoprotein , and adiponectin were independent risk factors for NAFPD aggravation ( P < .05). The NAFPD prevalence was about 11 % in Chinese adults. Its development and progression was related to NAFLD , T2DM , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , and GLP-1 levels. Severe NAFPD was associated with NAFLD and dyslipidemia.
