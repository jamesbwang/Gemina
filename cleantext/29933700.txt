  To synthesize evidence of the effectiveness of socio-ecological resilience rehabilitation programs on returning to work ( RTW) , self-efficacy , and stress mitigation following traumatic physical injuries. PubMed , Scopus , Proquest , Cinahl , Web of Science , Clinical Trials Database , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro tool. Randomized interventions aimed at promoting resilience. Twenty one studies were reviewed ( 11,904 participants). Data from 19 studies of high methodological quality were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for binary outcomes were calculated. Resilience rehabilitation programs significantly increased the likelihood of ever RTW ( OR 2.09 , 95 % CI 0.99-4.44 , p = 0.05) , decreased the number of days taken to return to work ( mean difference -7.80 , 95 % CI -13.16 to -2.45 , p â‰¤ 0.001) , and increased total self-efficacy scores ( mean difference 5.19 , 95 % CI 3.12-7.26 , p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses found that favorable return to work outcomes resulted from programs involving workplace support ( p < 0.001) and for people with musculoskeletal or orthopedic injuries ( p = 0.02). Compared to rehabilitation programs providing standard care following injuries , programs aimed at developing resilience could improve reemployment outcomes and self-efficacy. Implications for rehabilitation Individual resilience may be an important factor promoting functional recovery after traumatic injury. Resilience rehabilitation programs are effective in enabling patients ' return to work and increasing their self efficacy. In particular , programs involving the workplace are important components for enabling optimal work participation outcomes.
