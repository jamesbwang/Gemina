  Robotic surgery has been successfully used for many surgical indications in head and neck surgery. Robotic thyroidectomy is getting accepted worldwide , but the majority of the literature is from South Korea. The purpose of the paper is to review and give a personal perspective on how a robotic thyroidectomy program was initiated in a tertiary care academic medical institution in India. Advantages of robotic approaches are the three-dimensional visualization , precision , dexterity , and surgeon ergonomics. Cost is an important concern. Training includes basic robotics skill training , cadaveric training , observership , and hands-on training. Sufficient preclinical and clinical training is essential before embarking onto the newer surgical modality. Surgeon credentialing , though institution dependent , has specific guidelines. Case selection is the key , especially in the initial learning curve. The authors prefer the retroauricular approach for robotic thyroidectomy , and our initial experience in the first ten cases of total thyroidectomy was encouraging.
