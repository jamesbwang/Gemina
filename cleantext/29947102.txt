  Implantable medical devices provide an effective therapeutic approach for neurological and cardiovascular diseases. With the development of transient electronics , a new power source with biocompatibility , controllability , and bioabsorbability becomes an urgent demand for medical sciences. Here , various fully bioabsorbable natural-materials-based triboelectric nanogenerators ( BN-TENGs) , in vivo , are developed. The `` triboelectric series '' of five natural materials is first ranked , it provides a basic knowledge for materials selection and device design of the TENGs and other energy harvesters. Various triboelectric outputs of these natural materials are achieved by a single material and their pairwise combinations. The maximum voltage , current , and power density reach up to 55 V , 0.6 ÂµA , and 21.6 mW m
