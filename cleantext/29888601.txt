  Recent studies have suggested positive benefits of coffee consumption on inflammation-related diseases , such as liver diseases and diabetes , where activated lymphocytes and TNF-α are critically implicated. Interestingly , some reports suggested that javamide-II found in coffee may have anti-inflammatory activity greater than that of caffeine , but there is limited information about its effect on TNF-α production by activated lymphocytes. Therefore , the inhibitory effect of javamide-II on TNF-α was investigated in PMA/PHA-treated lymphocytic Jurkat cells. At 5 μM , javamide-II , not caffeine , inhibited TNF-α production in the cells ( 45 ± 4 % , P < 0.001). To elucidate the underlying mechanism , the phosphorylation of MAP kinases ( ERK , p38 , and JNK) was investigated in the Jurkat cells. Javamide-II had little effect on JNK or p38 phosphorylation , but javamide-II ( < 20 μM) decreased ERK phosphorylation , consequently reducing TNF-α mRNA expression in the cells ( P < 0.001). The involvement of ERK phosphorylation was also confirmed by an ERK1/2 inhibitor ( SCH772984). Furthermore , javamide-II was also found to inhibit IL-2 production , which is up-regulated by ERK phosphorylation in cells ( P < 0.001). These data suggested that javamide-II may be a potent compound to suppress TNF-α production more efficiently than caffeine by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation in Jurkat cells.
