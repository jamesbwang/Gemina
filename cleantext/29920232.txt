  To assess the feasibility of measuring ventilatory threshold ( VT) in higher-level , motor-complete spinal cord injury ( SCI) using four different analysis methods based on non-invasive gas exchange. Observational. Laboratory testing. Individuals with C4-T6 motor-complete SCI ( 16 paraplegia<symptom> , 22 tetraplegia; American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A/B; 42 ± 10 years of age). Not applicable. Ventilatory threshold from a graded arm cycling test to volitional exhaustion<symptom> using four methods: ventilatory equivalents , excess CO VT could be identified in all individuals with paraplegia<symptom> , but in only 68 % of individuals with tetraplegia. Individuals without observable VT completed the graded exercise test with lower ventilatory rate , peak power output , and V̇O The assessment of VT is a feasible alternative to peak exercise testing for aerobic fitness in individuals with higher-level , motor-complete SCI , although care should be taken when interpreting VT in individuals with tetraplegia who have lower cardiorespiratory fitness and lower peak power outputs.
