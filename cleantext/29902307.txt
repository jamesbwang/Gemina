  Portable music player use may have harmful effects on hearing. The magnitude and effect of frequent music exposure , especially at younger ages , on hearing are unclear. To examine the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss in a 9- to 11-year-old population and associations with portable music player use and sociodemographic factors. A cross-sectional study within an ongoing , prospective , birth cohort study within Rotterdam , the Netherlands was conducted. Between ages 9 and 11 years , 5355 children underwent their first audiometric evaluation. Children were excluded if they had missing or failed tympanometry results. The study was conducted from April 16 , 2012 , to October 25 , 2015. Portable music player ( PMP) use and sociodemographic factors assessed via parental questionnaires. Hearing acuity measured by pure-tone audiometry at 0.5 to 8 kHz. Possible noise-induced hearing loss was contingent on a high-frequency notch and/or high-frequency hearing loss in the audiogram , or reported hearing-related symptoms. The final sample included 3116 participants who were a mean ( interquartile range) age of 9.7 ( 9.6-9.9) years and equally distributed between boys ( 1550 ( 49.7 %)) and girls ( 1566 ( 50.3 %)). Of these , 1244 ( 39.9 %) reported no PMP use , 577 ( 18.5 %) reported use 1 or 2 days per week , 254 ( 8.2 %) reported use 3 or more days per week , and for 1041 ( 33.4 %) , PMP use was not reported. Audiometric notches and high-frequency hearing loss were present in 443 ( 14.2 %) of all children; 140 ( 4.5 %) fulfilled the criteria of a notch , 238 ( 7.6 %) of high-frequency hearing loss , and 65 ( 2.1 %) of both. Of the cohort , 52 ( 1.7 %) showed bilateral impairment. Hearing-related symptoms were reported for 232 ( 11.3 %) of the respondents , and 831 ( 40.0 %) of the respondents used portable music players. Portable music player use was associated with high-frequency hearing loss ( odds ratio ( OR) , 2.88; 95 % CI , 1.36-6.980 for 1 or 2 days per week and OR , 2.74; 95 % CI , 1.22-6.96 for â‰¥ 3 days per week) , but listening time and duration were not. There was no association of music exposure with high-frequency notches. In this study , 14.2 % of school-aged children showed audiometric notches or high-frequency hearing loss. This hearing impairment is already present prior to exposure to known noise hazards , such as club and concert attendance , and may have lifelong consequences. Repeated measurements are needed to confirm the association of portable music player use with hearing impairment in children.
