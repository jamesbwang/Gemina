Numerous peer-reviewed studies have shown orthokeratology ( OrthoK) is effective in slowing myopic progression. This review article covers the development of OrthoK , its mechanism of action , its evolution , and refinement from a refractive option to its use as a mean of slowing myopic progression. After detailing patterns of myopia progression , a description of theories and studies as to how OrthoK slows myopia progression in children is also explained. The review will focus on progression of myopia and the use of OrthoK to slow myopia progression after myopia has been diagnosed.
