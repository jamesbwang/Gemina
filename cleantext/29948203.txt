  Captive rearing of wild brown kiwi ( Apteryx mantelli) is widely carried out to assist in the recovery of this declining species. As a consequence , high densities of immunologically na√Øve kiwi are commonly housed in semi-captive conditions , with the potential to result in substantial morbidity and mortality from coccidiosis caused by multiple species of Eimeria. Previous research has described circadian variation in oocyst shedding across multiple avian host species. The aim of this research was to describe any circadian variation in oocyst shedding in brown kiwi. Droppings were collected from brown kiwi ( n = 4) at a single captive rearing facility using video surveillance to determine the time of excretion , and oocyst counts were undertaken. Results show that two of the Eimeria spp. affecting brown kiwi exhibit a peak in oocyst shedding between 03.00 and 07.00 with few or no oocysts shed between 08.00 and midnight. These results are not able to be explained by the current hypotheses theorising the evolutionary forces behind the development of this adaptive trait. Our findings increase the current understanding of the biology of the Eimeria spp. affecting brown kiwi and have important implications for the management of captive-reared kiwi , in particular for the accurate interpretation of faecal oocyst counts.
