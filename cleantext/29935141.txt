  Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection might increase risk of dementia , but available evidence is inconsistent , and longitudinal studies are sparse. We investigated the association between H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> serology and dementia risk in a population-based cohort. Between 1997 and 2002 , we measured H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> serum IgG titers in 4215 nondemented participants of the Rotterdam Study with a mean age of 69 years. We determined the association between H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> at baseline and dementia incidence until 2015 , per natural log ( U/mL) increase in titer , and for seropositive/seronegative , using Cox models adjusting for cohort , sex , age , education , and cardiovascular risk factors. During a median follow-up of 13.3 years , 529 participants developed dementia , of which 463 had Alzheimer 's disease. H pylori was not associated with risk of dementia ( hazard ratio ( 95 % confidence interval) for antibody titer: 1.04 ( 0.90-1.21); for seropositivity 1.03 ( 0.86-1.22)) , or Alzheimer 's disease. In this community-dwelling population , H pylori was not associated with dementia risk.
