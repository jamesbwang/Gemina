  Crowding is the substantial interference of neighboring items on target identification. Crowding with letter stimuli has been studied primarily in the visual periphery , with conflicting results for foveal stimuli. While a cortical locus for peripheral crowding is well established ( with a large spatial extent up to half of the target eccentricity) , disentangling the contributing factors in the fovea is more challenging due to optical limitations. Here , we used adaptive optics ( AO) to overcome ocular aberrations and employed high-resolution stimuli to precisely characterize foveal lateral interactions with high-contrast letters flanked by letters. Crowding was present , with a maximal edge-to-edge interference zone of 0.75-1.3 minutes at typical unflanked performance levels. In agreement with earlier foveal contour interaction studies , performance was non-monotonic , revealing a recovery effect with proximal flankers. Modeling revealed that the deleterious effects of flankers can be described by a single function across stimulus sizes when the degradation is expressed as a reduction in sensitivity ( expressed in Z-score units). The recovery , however , did not follow this pattern , likely reflecting a separate mechanism. Additional analysis reconciles multiple results from the literature , including the observed scale invariance of center-to-center spacing , as well as the size independence of edge-to-edge spacing.
