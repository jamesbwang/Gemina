  To study excitability of single motor units ( MUs<pathogen>) using high-density surface-EMG. Motor unit action potentials ( MUAPs) were evoked by submaximal stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist and recorded with a 9 Ã— 14 electrode grid on the skin overlying the thenar muscles. For excitability tests of single MUs<pathogen> , the most optimal specific single-channel surface-EMG signal was selected based on the spatiotemporal profile of single MUs<pathogen>. Axonal excitability measures were successfully obtained from 14 single MUs<pathogen> derived from ten healthy subjects. Selecting the optimal single-channel surface-EMG signals minimized interference from other single MUs<pathogen> and improved signal-to-noise ratio. The muscle fiber conduction velocity ( MFCV) could also be derived from the unique spatiotemporal profile of single MUs<pathogen>. High-density surface-EMG helps to isolate single MUAP responses , making it a suitable technique for assessing excitability in multiple single motor axons per nerve. Our method enables the reliable study of ion-channel dysfunction in single motor axons of nerves without any requirement for specific conditions , such as prominent MU loss or enlarged MUAPs due to collateral sprouting.
