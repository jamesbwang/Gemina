  The efficacy of treatments in vineyards largely depends on the necessary balance<symptom> between leaf coverage and spray drift and , therefore , knowledge about droplet size is of major importance , but scarce scientific information is available on pneumatic spraying , often adopted in this crop. The objective of this work was to obtain the relationships between the droplet size spectra characterization parameters and the main affecting factors in pneumatic nozzles. Three liquid flow rates ( LFR) and four air speeds ( AS) were combined in laboratory conditions to assess their influence on the droplet size spectra ( D10 , D50 and D90) , homogeneity ( Relative Span Factor , RSF) and driftability ( V The findings obtained can help vineyard farmers and technicians to effectively increase the efficiency and , therefore , the efficacy of the pesticide treatments reducing at the same time the spray drift risk by appropriate selection of the pneumatic spraying operational parameters , namely LFR and AS.
