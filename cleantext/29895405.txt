  Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ( SSADHD) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of GABA catabolism. SSADH is a mitochondrial homotetrameric enzyme encoded by ALDH5A1 gene. We report the molecular characterization of ALDH5A1 gene in an Italian SSADHD patient , showing heterozygosity for four missense mutations: c. 526G > A ( p.G176R) , c. 538C > T ( p.H180Y) , c. 709G > T ( p.A237S) and c. 1267A > T ( p.T423S) , the latter never described so far. The patient inherited c. 526A in cis with c. 538T from the mother and c. 709T in cis with c. 1267T from the father. To explore the effects of the two allelic arrangements on SSADH activity and protein level , wild type , single or double mutated cDNA constructs were expressed in a cell system. The p.G176R change , alone or in combination with p.H180Y , causes the abolishment of enzyme activity. Western blot analysis showed a strongly reduced amount of the p.176R-p.180 Y double mutant protein , suggesting increased degradation. Indeed , in silico analyses confirmed high instability of this mutant homotetramer. Enzyme activity relative to the other p.423S-p.237 S double mutant is around 30 % of wt. Further in silico analyses on all the possible combinations of mutant monomers suggest the lowest stability for the tetramer constituted by p.176R-p.180 Y monomers and the highest stability for that constituted by p.237S-p.423 S monomers. The present study shows that when a common SNP , associated with a slight reduction of SSADH activity , is inherited in cis with a mutation showing no consequences on the enzyme function , the activity is strongly affected. In conclusion , the peculiar arrangement of four missense mutations occurring in this patient is responsible for the SSADHD phenotype.
