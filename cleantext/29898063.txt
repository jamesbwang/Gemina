  The aim of this study was to evaluate by three-dimensional finite element analysis ( 3D-FEA) the biomechanics involved in bar-framework system for overdentures. The studied factors were latero-lateral angulation in the right implant ( -10 , -5 , 0 , 5 and 10 degrees) , and different bar cross-sections ( circular , Hader and oval) presenting horizontal misfits ( 50 or 150 Âµm) on the opposite implant. Positive angulation ( 5 and 10 degrees) for implant inclination to mesial position , negative angulation ( -5 and -10 degrees) for distal position , and zero degree for parallel implants. The von Mises stresses evaluated the bar , screw and the implant; maximum principal , minimum principal and shear stress analyses evaluated the peri-implant bone tissue. Parallel implants provide lower stress in alveolar bone tissue; mesial inclined bars showed the most negative effect on prosthetic structures and implants. In conclusion , bar cross-section showed no influence on stress distribution for peri-implant bone tissue , and circular bar provided better behavior to the prosthetic system. Higher stress concentration is provided to all system as the misfit increases.
