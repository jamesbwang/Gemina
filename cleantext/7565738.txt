  Several nuclear receptor family members have been associated with schizophrenia and inflammation<symptom>. Vitamins A and D exert anti-inflammatory actions , but their receptors ( mainly nuclear receptors) have not been extensively studied in either schizophrenia brains or in association with neuroinflammation. We examined the expression of vitamin A ( RARs and RXRs) and vitamin D and protein disulphide-isomerase A3 ( PDIA3) receptors , as well as nuclear orphan receptors ( NR4As) , in the context of elevated cytokine expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC). mRNA levels of nuclear receptors were measured in DLPFC tissues via RT-qPCR. ANCOVAs comparing high inflammation<symptom> schizophrenia , low<symptom> inflammation<symptom> schizophrenia and low<symptom> inflammation<symptom> control groups were performed. RARG , RXRB , NR4A1 and NR4A3 transcripts showed significant differential expression across the three groups ( ANCOVA p = 0.02-0.001). Post hoc testing revealed significant reductions in RARG expression in schizophrenia with low<symptom> inflammation<symptom> compared to schizophrenia with high inflammation<symptom> and to controls , and RXRB mRNA was significantly reduced in schizophrenia with low<symptom> inflammation<symptom> compared to controls. NR4A1 and NR4A3 mRNAs were decreased in schizophrenia with high inflammation<symptom> compared to schizophrenia with low<symptom> inflammation<symptom> , with NR4A1 also significantly different to controls. In schizophrenia , changes in nuclear receptor mRNA levels involved with mediating actions of vitamin A derivatives vary according to the inflammatory state of brains.
