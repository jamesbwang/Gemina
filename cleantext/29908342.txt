  Pathological angiogenesis is driven by uncontrolled growth of endothelial cells ( ECs) , which could lead to retinopathy , tumor and rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , etc.. ECs must experience multiple cell division process to grow , and cytokinesis is the final step. The present study shows that PEGylated GNRs ( PEG-GNRs) specifically target ECs cytokinesis process which results in high ratio of binucleated cells , and these binucleated ECs lose the ability to proliferate. Further data show that PEG-GNRs do not induce toxicity in vitro and in vivo. PEG-GNRs could inhibit ECs proliferation , migration , tube formation and inhibit angiogenesis in ex vivo model. Oxygen induced retinopathy and tumor angiogenesis model further show that PEG-GNRs can inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. Gene expression profiles reveal that PEG-GNRs mainly affect ECs cell division process , and PEG-GNRs treated ECs are arrested in G2/M phase. The mechanism is that PEG-GNRs could disrupt TGFÎ² pathway , and subsequently suppress the assembly of actin filaments in contractile ring site. These findings indicate that PEG-GNR is a novel cytokinesis inhibitor which can be used to interfere with retinal angiogenesis and tumor.
