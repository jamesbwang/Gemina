  We have investigated the effect of adding a pressurized metered dose inhaler ( pMDI) training device to verbal counselling on pulmonary function and inhalation technique. A total of 304 adult asthmatic subjects ( > 18 years old) were enrolled in a 3-month study of assessment and education. They were divided into an investigation group ( Trainhaler plus Flo-Tone and verbal counselling , n = 261 , mean age 49.2 years) and a control group ( verbal counselling only , n = 43 , mean age 48.7 years). Pulmonary function and inhalation technique were evaluated , mistakes noted , and the correct technique advised at three consecutive monthly visits. Visits also included verbal pMDI counselling ( both groups) and training device coaching ( investigation group). By visit 2 , the mean number of technique errors decreased significantly ( p < 0.05) in both groups ( investigation group p < 0.001). The investigation group demonstrated a marked decrease in the frequency of the critical error of maintaining a slow inhalation rate until the lungs are full-a technique difficult to learn via verbal counselling alone. The improvement in pulmonary function was significant from the second clinic visit in the investigation group ( p < 0.05) and from the third visit in both groups ( p < 0.001). Use of a training device combined with verbal counselling improved inhalation technique. An earlier , significant improvement was also noted in pulmonary function.
