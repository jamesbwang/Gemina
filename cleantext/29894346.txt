  We present an approach to airway management in a patient with machete injuries culminating in near-complete cricotracheal transection , in addition to a gunshot wound<disease> to the neck. Initial airway was established by direct intubation through the cricotracheal wound<disease>. Once the airway was secured , a bronchoscopy-guided orotracheal intubation was performed with simultaneous retraction of the cricotracheal airway to optimize the surgical field. This case offers insight into a rarely performed approach to airway management. Furthermore , our case report demonstrates that , in select airway injuries , performing through-the-wound intubation engenders a multitude of benefits.
