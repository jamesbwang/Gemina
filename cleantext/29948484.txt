  Reproductive isolation is essential for the process of speciation. In order to understand speciation , it is necessary to compare one mating group with other phylogenetically related but reproductively isolated groups. The Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale ( C. psl.) complex<pathogen> is a unicellular isogamous zygnematophycean alga , which is believed to share a close phylogenetic relationship with the land plants. In this study , we identified a new mating group , named group G , of C. psl. complex and compared its physiological and biochemical characteristics with the mating group I-E , which was closely related to the mating group G. Zygospores are typically formed as a result of conjugation between mating-type plus ( mt
