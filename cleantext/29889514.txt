  A triple-layer QM/sQM/MM method was developed for accurately describing the excited-state molecular interactions between chromophore and the molecular environment ( Hasegawa , J.; Yanai , K.; Ishimura , K. ChemPhysChem 2015 , 16 , 305). A first-order-interaction space ( FOIS) was defined for the interactions between QM and secondary QM ( sQM) regions. Moreover , configuration interaction singles ( CIS) and its second-order perturbation theory ( PT2) calculations were performed within this space. In this study , numerical implementation of this FOISPT2 method significantly reduced the computing time , which realized application to solvatochromic systems , p-coumaric acid in neutral ( p-CA) and anionic forms in aqueous solution , retinal Schiff base in methanol ( MeOH) solution , and bacteriorhodopsin ( bR). The results were consistent with the experimentally observed absorption spectra of the applied systems. The QM/sQM/MM result for the opsin shift was in better agreement to the experimental result than that of the ordinary QM/MM. A decomposition analysis was performed for the excited-state molecular interactions. Among the electronic interactions , charge-transfer ( CT) effect , excitonic interaction , and dispersion interaction showed significant large contributions , while the electronic polarization effect presented only minor contribution. Furthermore , the result was analyzed to determine the contributions from each environmental molecule and was interpreted based on the distance of the molecules from the Ï€ system in the chromophores.
