  Previous studies have reported slightly higher stroke rates in Takotsubo Syndrome<disease> compared to acute myocardial infarction. Our goal was to evaluate the temporal course of stroke rates and left ventricular recovery in patients with Takotsubo Syndrome<disease>. We retrospectively examined the clinical and imaging data of 72 patients with Takotsubo Syndrome<disease>. The data collected came from January 2005 to March 2017. Left ventricular performance was evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) in all patients during the acute phase of Takotsubo Syndrome<disease> and in a follow-up scan 2 months later. Acute stroke and major adverse clinical events , such as myocardial infarction or recurrence of Takotsubo Syndrome<disease> and death , were also determined for each patient at 30 days and 12 months after initial presentation. The MRI scans performed during the acute phase of Takotsubo Syndrome<disease> demonstrated apical ballooning with anterior wall motion dysfunction in 65 ( 90 %) patients. Imaging performed 2 months later demonstrated resolution of this in 97 % of those patients. Median left ventricular ejection fraction also significantly increased between both scans ( 49.5 % vs. 64.0 % , P < 0.001). We observed 9 ( 12 %) events in the study population within 12 months of the initial diagnosis of Takotsubo Syndrome<disease>. Stroke had an event rate of 2.8 % after 30 days and 4.2 % after 12 months. Apical ballooning was found in the majority of our Takotsubo Syndrome<disease> patients on the MRI scans performed at presentation. This finding was subsequently associated with higher than expected stroke rates within 30 days of diagnosis and with rapid recovery of left ventricular function within 2 months of diagnosis. This suggests that rapid improvement in left ventricular morphology and function may facilitate the formation of cardiac emboli and consequently increase stroke rates in Takotsubo Syndrome. Although no guidelines currently exist for the treatment of Takotsubo Syndrome<disease> , these results may point to a potential role for temporary oral anticoagulation in high-risk patients. Future studies should examine if stroke rates after Takotsubo Syndrome<disease> have been underestimated.
