  This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of screw placement and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing occipitocervical fusion. Patients who underwent occipitocervical fusion with O-arm-based navigation were retrospectively reviewed between January 2015 and December 2017. The patients ' characteristics , clinical and radiographic outcomes , and surgical complications were recorded and analyzed. Cervical screw insertion accuracy was evaluated using the Richter scale. Thirty consecutive patients ( 11 male and 19 female) with an average treatment age of 40.03 ± 15.19 years were studied. The most common cause was atlantoaxial instability combined with Chiari malformation ( 63.33 %). Weakness<symptom> ( 76.67 %) and paresthesia ( 70.00 %) were the most common symptoms. Eighty-six occipital and 139 cervical screws were placed using an O-arm-assisted navigation system. In total , 130 ( 93.53 %) cervical screws were graded as group A and 9 ( 6.47 %) as group B. The optimal accuracy rate was 88.41 % ( 61 of 69 screws) in the first 15 patients and 98.57 % ( 69 of 70 screws) in the subsequent 15 patients. The mean follow-up time was 7.50 ± 5.70 months. The mean Japanese Orthopedic Association scores were 13.30 ± 2.41 preoperatively and 15.30 ± 1.60 at final follow-up ( P < 0.001) , and the mean recovery rate in the Japanese Orthopedic Association score was 53.26 ± 33.82 %. Clinical improvement was seen in 25 patients ( 83.33 %) , whereas no change was observed in 5 patients ( 16.67 %). The overall complication rate was 6.67 % ( 2/30) , with 1 intraoperative vertebral artery injury and 1 postoperative screw loosening. Occipitocervical fusion with O-arm-based navigation is effective and safe for treating instability of the craniovertebral junction. Intraoperative navigation can help surgeons insert screws accurately.
