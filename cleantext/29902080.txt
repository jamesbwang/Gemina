  Carrageenan ( CGN) is a common food additive that has been widely used for decades as a gelling , thickening and stabilizing agent. Carrageenan has been proven safe for human consumption; however , there has been significant confusion<symptom> in the literature between CGN and the products of intentional acid-hydrolysis of CGN , which are degraded CGN ( d-CGN) and poligeenan ( PGN). In part , this confusion<symptom> was due to the nomenclature used in early studies on CGN , where poligeenan was referred to as `` degraded carrageenan '' ( d-CGN) and `` degraded carrageenan '' was simply referred to as carrageenan. Although this nomenclature has been corrected , confusion<symptom> still exists resulting in misinterpretation of data and the subsequent dissemination of incorrect information regarding the safe dietary use of CGN. The lack of understanding of the molecular weight distribution of CGN has further exacerbated the issue. The significant differences in chemistry , manufacture , and protein reactivity of CGN versus d-CGN and PGN are reviewed , in addition to the in vivo toxicological profiles of CGN , d-CGN , and PGN. As CGN can not be hydrolyzed to PGN in vivo , concerns over the use of CGN as a food additive are unfounded , particularly since current studies support the lack of oncogenic and tumorigenic activity of CGN in humans.
