  Advanced biliary tract cancer ( ABC) has a poor prognosis. Cediranib , in addition to cisplatin/gemcitabine ( CisGem) , improved the response rate , but did not improve the progression-free survival ( PFS) in the ABC-03 study. Minimally invasive biomarkers predictive of cediranib benefit may improve patient outcomes. Changes in 15 circulating plasma angiogenesis or inflammatory-related proteins and cytokeratin-18 ( CK18) , measured at baseline and during therapy until disease progression , were correlated with overall survival ( OS) using time-varying covariate Cox models ( TVC). Samples were available from n = 117/124 ( 94 %) patients. Circulating Ang1 & 2 , FGFb , PDGFbb , VEGFC , VEGFR1 and CK18 decreased as a result of the therapy , independent of treatment with cediranib. Circulating VEGFR2 and Tie2 were preferentially reduced by cediranib. Patients with increasing levels of VEGFA at any time had a worse PFS and OS; this detrimental effect was attenuated in patients receiving cediranib. TVC analysis revealed CK18 and VEGFR2 increases correlated with poorer OS in all patients ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.02 , respectively). Rising circulating VEGFA levels in patients with ABC , treated with CisGem , are associated with worse PFS and OS , not seen in patients receiving cediranib. Rising levels of markers of tumour burden ( CK18) and potential resistance ( VEGFR2) are associated with worse outcomes and warrant validation.
