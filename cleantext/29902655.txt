  Response surface methodology was used to optimise pyrolysis conditions to produce biochar from maize residues ( cobs , husks , leaves and stalks). The aim was to obtain biochar with good potential as an additive for composting. Mathematical models were developed to explain the experimental responses of volatile matter content ( VM) , ash content ( AC) , pH and electrical conductivity ( EC) to the operating parameters such as temperature , heating rate and holding time. The temperature had the most significant influence on biochar properties. AC , pH and EC significantly increased ( p < 0.05) with increasing temperature , while the VM decreased. The holding time showed less effect on the responses , while the heating rate had insubstantial effect. Under the optimal conditions , the husk and leaf biochar had higher AC ( 11.42 and 26.55 %) , pH ( 10.96 and 11.51) , and EC ( 12.37 and 6.79 mS/cm) , but lower VM ( 7.38 and 8.39 %) than those of cob and stalk biochar.
