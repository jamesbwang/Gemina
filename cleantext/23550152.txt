  As a consequence of exposure to environmental toxicants , a `` field cancerization '' effect occurs in the lung , resulting in the development of a field of initiated , but morphologically normal appearing cells within a damaged epithelium containing mutations in oncogene or tumor suppressor genes. Unlike humans , whose airway field of injury associated with lung cancer has long been investigated with airway brushings obtained via bronchoscopy , no methods are available for similar studies in the mouse due to the small size of the murine airways. In this protocol , we describe a detailed method for performing airway brushing from a live mouse , which enables repeated sampling from the same mouse and thus , mimicking the bronchoscopy protocol used in humans. Using this approach in the N-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea ( NTCU)- induced mouse lung squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) model , we isolated airway epithelial cells with intact cell membrane structure and then performed transcriptome sequencing ( RNA-Seq). We found activation of the PI3K signaling network to be the most significant in cytologically normal bronchial airway epithelial cells of mice with preneoplastic lung SCC lesions<symptom>. Prolonged exposure to NTCU also induced activation of NF-kappaB ( NFƙB) , the downstream pathway of PI3K; this NTCU-induced lung SCC progression can be reversed by blocking the NFƙB pathway.
