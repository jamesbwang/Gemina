  We investigate the properties of static and axisymmetric vacuum solutions of Einstein equations which generalize the Schwarzschild spherically symmetric solution to include a quadrupole parameter. We test all the solutions with respect to elementary and asymptotic flatness and curvature regularity. Analysing their multipole structure , according to the relativistic invariant Geroch definition , we show that all of them are equivalent up to the level of the quadrupole. We conclude that the
