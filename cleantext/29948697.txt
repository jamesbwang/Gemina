  The feasibility of biomarkers to accurately detect pollution in estuaries and coastal areas appears to be overestimated in the scientific literature , and is likely stemming from a bias towards publishing only positive results. Herein , we test the applicability of antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation to detect potential in situ sewage impacts on a subtropical estuary. We experimentally assessed variation in malondialdehyde ( MDA , an indicator of lipid peroxidation) and total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals ( ACAP) through transplantations of the worm Laeonereis culveri from control to sewage-polluted areas. Variations in biomarkers were more related to natural environmental variability and small-scale heterogeneity among areas than to experimental exposure to sewage. Use of oxidative stress biomarkers is promising but further experimental work under real-life conditions is necessary to further validate and establish their accuracy and feasibility for practical purposes.
