  Assessment of the interactions between a drug and its protein target in a physiologically relevant cellular environment constitutes a major challenge in the pre-clinical drug discovery space. The Cellular Thermal Shift Assay ( CETSA) enables such an assessment by quantifying the changes in the thermal stability of proteins upon ligand binding in intact cells. Here , we present the development and validation of a homogeneous , standardized , target-independent , and high-throughput ( 384- and 1536-well formats) CETSA platform that uses a split Nano Luciferase approach ( SplitLuc CETSA). The broad applicability of the assay was demonstrated for diverse targets , and its performance was compared with independent biochemical and cell-based readouts using a set of well-characterized inhibitors. Moreover , we investigated the utility of the platform as a primary assay for high-throughput screening. The SplitLuc CETSA presented here enables target engagement studies for medium and high-throughput applications. Additionally , it provides a rapid assay development and screening platform for targets where phenotypic or other cell-based assays are not readily available.
