  Highly catalytic electrodes play a vital role in exploiting the capability of vanadium redox flow batteries ( VRFBs) , but they suffer from a tedious synthesis process and ambiguous interaction mechanisms for catalytic sites. Herein , a facile urea pyrolysis process was applied to prepare graphitic carbon nitride-modified graphite felt ( GF@CN) , and by the virtue of a density functional theory-assisted calculation , the electron-rich pyridinic nitrogen atom of CN granules is demonstrated as the adsorption center for redox species and plays the key role in improving the performance of VRFBs , with 800 cycles and an energy efficiency of 75 % at 150 mA cm
