  In total , 80 % -90 % of Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL) patients are curable with combination chemoradiotherapy. Due to improvements in therapeutic strategies , 50 % of all relapsed/refractory patients may undergo complete clinical responses and have long-term survival. Treatment options for HL are effective , but may have a negative impact on post-chemotherapy fertility. Thus , cryopreservation of semen prior to treatment is recommended for male patients. For female patients , assisted reproductive techniques ( ART) consult and fertility preservation should be offered as a therapeutical option. In the last years , new targeted molecules have been available for HL treatment. These new drugs showed a high rate of overall responses in the setting of heavily pretreated patients , most of them in relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation , a group previously considered very poor risk. Up to 50 % of patients have a complete response and an improved overall survival. Future studies will address the usefulness of novel molecules as a frontline therapy. Considering the high response and survival rates with monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics , fertility has become a concerning issue for long-term HL survivors. As progress has been made regarding ART , with the rigorous steps planned for HL patients , more survivors will become parents.
