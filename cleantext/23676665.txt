  Tandem fluorescent protein timers are elegant tools to determine proteolytic stabilities of cytosolic proteins with high spatial and temporal resolution. In a new study published in BMC Biology , Kowalski et al. fused timers to precursors of proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space and found that they are under surveillance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination at lysine residues of these precursors directly inhibits their translocation into the intermembrane space and targets them for proteasomal degradation.
