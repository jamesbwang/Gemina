  Stevens-Johnson syndrome<disease> ( SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN) are rare , type IV hypersensitivity<disease> reactions of the skin and mucosa. These reactions ( SJS/TEN) are frequently managed in burn units; however , no standardized guidelines exist for the treatment and management of SJS/TEN. To gain insight into current SJS/TEN management practices , a survey on admission , diagnosis , and management , was conducted across accredited burn units in the United States. A 28-item question survey on SJS/TEN management , diagnosis , and treatment practices was distributed among medical directors and co-directors of American Burn Association-verified burn centers. Responses were collected over a 6-week period. In total , 31 ( 48 % response rate) burn unit medical directors/co-directors participated in the survey. The majority of responders indicate that acceptance to their burn unit is based on clinical suspicion of SJS/TEN ( 74 %) , and biopsy or dermatological evaluation is not required ( 67 and 87 % , respectively). More than half ( 61 %) of the burn units have their own SJS/TEN protocol in place. No consensus was observed on different treatment aspects , such as infection control , systemic treatment , and wound<disease> care. Most directors reported their burn units to consult ophthalmology ( 77 %) and dermatology ( 54 %) for the management of patients with SJS/TEN. Large variability in procedures of admission , treatment , and management of SJS/TEN was identified across burn centers. This study demonstrates the urgent need for SJS/TEN standardized guidelines in the United States.
