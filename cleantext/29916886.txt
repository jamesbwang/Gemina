  The aim of this study was to determine whether molar incisor hypomineralization ( MIH) is greater in patients with cleft lip and palate ( CLP) who underwent primary alveolar grafting ( PAG) as compared with CLP waiting for secondary alveolar grafting ( SAG) and with controls. A retrospective analysis of intraoral photographs of 13 CLP patients who underwent a PAG , 28 CLP prior to SAG , and 60 controls without CLP was performed. Mantel-Haenszel Ï‡ tests were used to compare the 3 groups for differences in MIH scores , and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare the groups for differences in average MIH scores. A 5 % significance level was used for all tests. Molar incisor hypomineralization scores were significantly higher for the PAG and SAG groups compared with the control group ( P < 0.001). The PAG group had significantly higher incisor MIH ( P = 0.016) compared with the SAG group. Molar incisor hypomineralization average scores were significantly higher for the 2 graft groups compared with the controls ( P < 0.0001). The PAG group had significantly higher average MIH score and average MIH score for incisors compared with the SAG group ( P = 0.03). Cleft lip and palate patients have significantly greater MIH compared with controls , and CLP patients with PAGs have significantly greater MIH in the incisor region compared with CLP patients with SAGs , indicating that subjects with PAGs have more severely affected dentition.
