  We aim to determine if Pseudomonas<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> is a viable biological control for Erwinia<pathogen> tracheiphila within the insect vector , Acalymma vittatum. Pseudomonas<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> secreted fluorescein and inhibited growth of E. tracheiphila in disc diffusion assays. To determine if this antagonism was conserved within the insect vector , we performed in vivo assays by orally injecting beetles with bacterial treatments and fluorescent in situ hybridization to determine bacterial presence within the alimentary canal. Pseudomonas<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> inhibited the growth of E. tracheiphila on a nutrient-limiting medium. In situ experiments demonstrated that P.<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> is maintained within the alimentary canal of the beetle for at least 4 days , and co-occurred with E. tracheiphila. When beetles were first presented with Pseudomonas and then challenged with E. tracheiphila , E. tracheiphila was not recovered via FISH after 4 days. These data suggest that P.<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> has potential as a biological control agent to limit E. tracheiphila within the insect vector. This is a novel approach for controlling E. tracheiphila that has the potential to decrease reliance on insecticides , providing a safer environment for pollinators and growers.
