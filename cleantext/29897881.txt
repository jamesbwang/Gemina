  Objective Previous studies have shown that high socioeconomic status ( SES) is significantly associated with inhibitory control , working memory , verbal comprehension and IQ. However , in the Asian setting , with its prevailing poverty , information about the influence of SES on cognitive development of female adolescents is limited. This study was aimed to investigate the association between SES and neurocognitive performance of early female adolescents in Sri Lanka. Methods Female adolescents aged 11-14 years ( n = 200) of low and middle SES were studied to assess neurocognitive function. After obtaining baseline data , eight subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ( WISC- IV) , Test Of Nonverbal Intelligence ( TONI-3) and two computer-based executive function tests ( inhibition and visuo-spatial working memory) were administered to assess neurocognitive measures of the above adolescents. The results were compiled into a data base and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. Results Higher SES was associated with higher performance in all neurocognitive tests. Low SES adolescents obtained significantly poor test scores for executive function test ( inhibitory control: p < 0.0001) and for WISC ( verbal comprehension index ( VCI): p < 0.0001) , working memory index ( WMI): p < 0.0001 and estimated full scale IQ ( EFSIQ): p < 0.0001)) when compared with middle SES adolescents. Maternal education alone significantly predicts VCI and EFSIQ than the combined influence of parental education , occupation and income. Psychosocial adversities of adolescents were inversely correlated with VCI ( r = -0.30; p < 0.001) and EFSIQ ( r = -0.20; p < 0.001) of WISC and mathematics performance ( r = -0.34; p < 0.001) at examination in school. Conclusion Findings of the study revealed the importance of upliftment of SES of the society to improve the cognitive and academic outcomes of low SES individuals.
