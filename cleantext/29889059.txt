  The aim of this study was to examine the effect of Mulligan ankle taping on center of pressure ( COP) parameters during performance of a functional upper limb task in patients with chronic ankle instability ( CAI). A clinical controlled trial study designed between 4 ankle conditions: untapped and taped , CAI and healthy subjects. Fifteen subjects with CAI and 15 healthy controls were asked to grasp an object at their waist level and release it above shoulder level in an oblique pattern during performance of singleleg stance balance<symptom> test. All the subjects performed 3 trials of single-leg stance with eyes opened before and after Mulligan taping on a force plate during performance of functional upper limb task The mean displacement ( mdCOP) , range of COP excursion ( rangeCOP) and average speed of COP ( velCOP) in anteroposterior ( AP) and mediolateral ( ML) directions were analysed for differences between groups. mdCOP and rangeCOP in AP direction were significantly increased ( P = 0.04 and 0.03 , respectively) in the CAI group. Mulligan taping significantly reduced velCOP in AP and ML directions ( P = 0.02). In CAI patients Mulligan ankle taping can improve postural control by decreasing velCOP , therefore Mulligan taping can have immediate positive effects on postural parameters and maintenance of dynamic postural control.
