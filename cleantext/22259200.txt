  Fungi<pathogen> , usually present as commensals , are a major cause of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. Such infections , if not diagnosed or treated properly , can prove fatal. However , in most cases healthy individuals are able to avert the fungal attacks by mounting proper antifungal immune responses. Among the pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs) , C-type lectin receptors ( CLRs) are the major players in antifungal immunity. CLRs can recognize carbohydrate ligands , such as Î²-glucans and mannans , which are mainly found on fungal cell surfaces. They induce proinflammatory immune reactions , including phagocytosis , oxidative burst , cytokine , and chemokine production from innate effector cells , as well as activation of adaptive immunity
