  This article explores the development of retinal imaging , with particular emphasis on ultra-widefield imaging and the key concept of field of view. Two ultra-widefield imaging platforms are examined in detail-Optomap and Spectralis-noncontact imaging systems that include protocols for performing angiography in infants. Applications of ultra-widefield imaging are illustrated using case studies , including diagnosis , monitoring , and screening.
