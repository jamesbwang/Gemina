  Palladium , the building block of white gold , has been found to exhibit extraordinary properties in nanotechnological products produced in recent years. The most prominent feature of palladium is adsorbing and storing high levels of hydrogen. Therefore , the demand for palladium in the world increased excessively in the 2000s. In the present study , palladium nanoparticles ( PdNPs) were biosynthesized by the extract of Diospyros kaki leaves as bio-stimulator. D. kaki , also called persimmon , was collected in a local area in Istanbul Turkey. PdNP formation was screened by analyzing UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 250-550 nm. The nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscope which revealed that the biosynthesized PdNPs were in sizes ranging from 50 to 120 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy applied on both D. kaki leaf extract and PdNPs was used to decide on the reactive groups managing the reduction of the biosynthesized nanoparticles. Also , the PdNPs showed reasonably proficient antibacterial efficacy for both Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and the zones of inhibition were found as 18 and 10.5 mm , respectively.
