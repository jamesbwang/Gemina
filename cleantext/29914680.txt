  The purpose of this pilot study was to use a multiplexed assay to measure cytokines in normal stimulated canine tears. 25 healthy dogs were included in the study. Stimulated tears were collected in capillary tubes from the right ( OD) and left ( OS) eyes and stored at -80 °C until batch sample analysis was performed. The samples were analyzed utilizing Luminex Diluting the samples 1:10 rendered all analytes undetectable except IL-8. A repeat analysis of eight randomly selected undiluted samples still demonstrated very low cytokine levels except for IL-8 ( 16/16 eyes; 2254 ± 1677 pg/ml OD , 1095 ± 786.8 pg/ml OS); and IFN-γ ( 15/16 eyes; 13.37 ± 13.08 pg/ml OD ,16.08 ± 19.4 pg/ml OS). This pilot study is the first to analyze cytokines in canine tears. This study demonstrated that IL-8 is consistently detected in both diluted and undiluted samples , but undiluted samples may be superior to 1:10 diluted samples for evaluation of other cytokines in canine tears.
