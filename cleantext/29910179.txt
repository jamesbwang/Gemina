  Patients with residual chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) following initial purine analog-based chemoimmunotherapy exhibit a shorter duration of response and may benefit from novel therapeutic strategies. We and others have previously described the safety and efficacy of autologous T cells modified to express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptors ( CARs) in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> and CLL. Here we report the use of CD19-targeted CAR T cells incorporating the intracellular signaling domain of CD28 ( 19-28z) as a consolidative therapy in 8 patients with residual CLL following first-line chemoimmunotherapy with pentostatin , cyclophosphamide , and rituximab. Outpatients received low-dose conditioning therapy with cyclophosphamide ( 600 mg/m
