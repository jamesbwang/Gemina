  The panniculus carnosus is a thin striated muscular layer intimately attached to the skin and fascia of most mammals , where it provides skin twitching<symptom> and contraction functions. In humans , the panniculus carnosus is conserved at sparse anatomical locations with high interindividual variability , and it is considered of no functional significance ( most possibly being a remnant of evolution). Diverse research fields ( such as anatomy , dermatology , myology , neuroscience , surgery , veterinary science) use this unique muscle as a model , but several unknowns and misconceptions remain in the literature. In this article , we review what is currently known about panniculus carnosus structure , development , anatomical location , response to environmental stimuli and potential function ( s) , with the aim of putting together the evidence arising from the different research communities and raising interest in this unique muscle , which we postulate as an ideal model for both vascular and muscular research.
