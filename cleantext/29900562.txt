  To assess the feasibility of producing artificial teeth for endodontic training using 3D printing technology , to analyse the accuracy of the printing process , and to evaluate the teeth by students when used during training. Sound<symptom> extracted human teeth were selected , digitalized by cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT) and appropriate software and finally reproduced by a stereolithographic printer. The printed teeth were scanned and compared with the original ones ( trueness) and to one another ( precision). Undergraduate dental students in the third and fourth years performed root canal treatment on printed molars and were subsequently asked to evaluate their experience with these compared to real teeth. The workflow was feasible for manufacturing 3D printed tooth replicas. The absolute deviation after printing ( trueness) ranged from 50.9 to 104.3 μm. The values for precision ranged from 43.5 to 68.2 μm. Students reported great benefits in the use of the replicated teeth for training purposes. The presented workflow is feasible for any dental educational institution who has access to a CBCT unit and a stereolithographic printer. The accuracy of the printing process is suitable for the production of tooth replicas for endodontic training. Undergraduate students favoured the availability of these replicas and the fairness they ensured in training due to standardization.
