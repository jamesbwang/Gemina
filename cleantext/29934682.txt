  Breast milk is the optimal nutrition for babies in their first six months of life and provides health benefits for both children and mothers. As part of the Robert Koch Institute 's health monitoring , the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents ( KiGGS) regularly collects population-based data on the health situation of children and adolescents living in Germany , including information on breastfeeding. This article describes breastfeeding behaviour based on the results of KiGGS Wave 2 ( 2014-2017). The prevalence of breastfeeding and the duration of breastfeeding in the birth cohorts 2009-2016 as well as information on intention to breastfeed and reasons for weaning are described. The results from KiGGS Wave 2 show that breastfeeding proportions for any type of breastfeeding tended to increase between the birth cohorts 2009/2010 and 2013/2014 , while the prevalence for full and exclusive breastfeeding show no change. The average duration of breastfeeding has remained constant. Almost 90 % of mothers intended to breastfeed their baby after birth and 97 % of these mothers actually started breastfeeding. Having insufficient breast milk has often been mentioned as a problem , both by mothers who intended to breastfeed but did not start breastfeeding and by mothers who have been breastfeeding their infants for less than six months. Despite some limitations , the KiGGS study is an important part of breastfeeding monitoring. Regular data collection and the largely consistent study design make it possible to map trends in time and to measure the impact of breastfeeding promotion on the population. KiGGS Wave 2 shows that breastfeeding promotion measures are still necessary.
