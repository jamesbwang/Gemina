  Systemic involvement in autoimmune diseases is often unclear and organ changes are confounding , thus making it difficult to have an early accurate diagnosis. In those situations , both clinical and paraclinical findings might orientate the diagnosis , but only histological or immunohistochemistry changes might be accurate enough. The skin histological changes are relevant and sometimes might have a tremendous role in the accurate diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases , due to the correlation with the clinical systemic manifestations of the diseases and through the accessibility of biopsy. In the same time , muscle biopsy can provide important support for physicians improving diagnosis and optimizing management of connective tissue diseases.
