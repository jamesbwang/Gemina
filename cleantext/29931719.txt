  The aim of this randomized four-way cross-over study was to examine the effect of added protein and/or fat in standard meals with a fixed carbohydrate content on postprandial glucose control with closed-loop insulin delivery in adults with type 1 diabetes. Participants ( n = 15) consumed breakfast meals with a fixed carbohydrate content ( 75 ± 1 g) and added protein and/or fat ( 35 ± 2 g): ( 1) carbohydrate-only ( standard) , ( 2) high protein ( HP) , ( 3) high fat ( HF) and ( 4) high fat + protein ( HFHP). The closed-loop insulin delivery algorithm generated insulin bolus and infusion rates. The addition of fat , protein or both did not impact 5-hour post-meal sensor glucose area under the curve ( AUC) ( main outcome) , mean sensor glucose or glycaemic peak as compared with a standard meal ( P > 0.05). However , time to glycaemic peak was delayed by 40 minutes ( P = 0.03) and 5-hour post-meal basal insulin requirements were 39 % higher ( P = 0.04) with an HFHP meal compared with a standard meal. In conclusion , in the context of closed-loop insulin delivery , protein and/or fat meal content affects the timing of postprandial glycaemic peak , insulin requirements and late glycaemic excursion , without impacting overall 5-hour AUC.
