  Sleep and metabolism are physiologically and behaviorally intertwined; however , the molecular basis for their interaction remains poorly understood. Here , we identified a serine metabolic pathway as a key mediator for starvation-induced sleep suppression. Transcriptome analyses revealed that enzymes involved in serine biosynthesis were induced upon starvation in
