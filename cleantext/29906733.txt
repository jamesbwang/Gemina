  Time series remote sensing vegetation indices derived from SPOT 5 data are compared with vegetation structure and eddy covariance flux data at 15 dry to wet reclamation and reference sites within the Oil Sands region of Alberta , Canada. This comprehensive analysis examines the linkages between indicators of ecosystem function and change trajectories observed both at the plot level and within pixels. Using SPOT imagery , we find that higher spatial resolution datasets ( e.g. 10 m) improves the relationship between vegetation indices and structural measurements compared with interpolated ( lower resolution) pixels. The simple ratio ( SR) vegetation index performs best when compared with stem density-based indicators ( R
