  Preliminary evidence suggests that premature immunosenescence is involved in bipolar disorder ( BD) pathophysiology. The cellular marker CD69 is expressed in T lymphocyte<symptom> surface during their activation and its expression is negatively correlated with age. The objective of this study was to assess the moderating effects of obesity on the reduction of expression of CD69 , a marker of immunosenescence. Forty euthymic patients with BD type I , aged 18-65 years , were included in this study. The healthy comparison group consisted of 39 volunteers who had no current or lifetime history of mental disorders , no use of psychotropic medications , and no known family history of mood disorders or psychosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BD patients and healthy controls were collected and isolated. The cells were allowed to grow in culture and stimulated for 3 days. CD69 was marked and read in flow cytometry. We found that the lower expression of CD69 in BD patients was moderated by body mass index ( BMI) in both CD4 + ( RR = 0.977 , 95 % CI 0.960-0.995 ,
