  We report here the first complete genome sequence of a Japanese isolate of lychnis mottle virus ( LycMoV-J). The genome segments of LycMoV-J have a unique structure in their 3 ' untranslated regions , and the encoded proteins have the same structure as that of an isolate reported from South Korea.
