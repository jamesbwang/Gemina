  With an attempt to economically and efficiently improve the water resistance of defatted soya bean flour ( DSF)- based wood adhesives , DSF was subjected to thermal treatment at various temperatures ( 65 °C , 80 °C , 95 °C , 110 °C and 125 °C) for 30 min. The effects of thermal treatment temperature onto the chemical structure , crystalline degree , water-insoluble content and acetaldehyde value of the thermally treated DSF ( T-DSF) were investigated. The thermal stabilities and bonding properties of soya bean adhesives prepared from T-DSF and cross-linker epichlorohydrin-modified polyamide ( EMPA) were also investigated. Test results indicated that both the water-insoluble content and the acetaldehyde value of T-DSF increased after thermal treatment , reaching the highest values of 27.28 % and 26.81 mg g
