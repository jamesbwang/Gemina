  Iron overload due to environmental or genetic causes have been associated diabetes. We hypothesized that prenatal iron exposure is associated with higher risk of childhood type 1 diabetes. In the Norwegian Mother and Child cohort study ( n = 94,209 pregnancies , n = 373 developed type 1 diabetes) the incidence of type 1 diabetes was higher in children exposed to maternal iron supplementation than unexposed ( 36.8/ 100,000/ year compared to 28.6/ 100,000/ year , adjusted hazard ratio 1.33 , 95 % CI: 1.06-1.67). Cord plasma biomarkers of high iron status were non-significantly associated with higher risk of type 1 diabetes ( ferritin OR = 1.05 ( 95 % CI: 0.99-1.13) per 50 mg/L increase; soluble transferrin receptor: OR = 0.91 ( 95 % CI: 0.81-1.01) per 0.5 mg/L increase). Maternal but not fetal HFE genotypes causing high/intermediate iron stores were associated with offspring diabetes ( odds ratio: 1.45 , 95 % CI: 1.04 , 2.02). Maternal anaemia or non-iron dietary supplements did not significantly predict type 1 diabetes. Perinatal iron exposures were not associated with cord blood DNA genome-wide methylation , but fetal HFE genotype was associated with differential fetal methylation near HFE. Maternal cytokines in mid-pregnancy of the pro-inflammatory M1 pathway differed by maternal iron supplements and HFE genotype. Our results suggest that exposure to iron during pregnancy may be a risk factor for type 1 diabetes in the offspring.
