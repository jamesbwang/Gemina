  Substance P ( SP) causes vasodilation and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) reduction. However , the involvement of tachykinin receptors ( NKRs) within baroreflex afferent pathway in SP-mediated BP regulation is largely unknown. Under control and hypertensive condition , NKRs ' expressions were evaluated in nodose ( NG) and nucleus of tractus solitary ( NTS) of male , female , and ovariectomized ( OVX) rats; BP was recorded after microinjection of SP and NKRs agonists into NG; Baroreceptor sensitivity ( BRS) was tested as well. Immunostaining and immunoblotting data showed that NK1R and NK2R were estrogen-dependently expressed on myelinated and unmyelinated afferents in NG. A functional study showed that BP was reduced dose-dependently by SP microinjection , which was more dramatic in males and can be mimicked by NK1R and NK2R agonists. Notably , further BP elevation and BRS dysfunction were confirmed in desoxycorticosterone acetate ( DOCA)- salt model in OVX compared with DOCA-salt model in intact female rats. Additionally , similar changes in NKRs ' expression in NG were also detected using DOCA-salt and SHR. Compared with NG , inversed expression profiles of NKRs were also found in NTS with either gender. The estrogen-dependent NKRs ' expression in baroreflex afferent pathway participates at least partially in sexual-dimorphic and SP-mediated BP regulation under physiological and hypertensive conditions.
