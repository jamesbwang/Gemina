  Gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms ( NENs) are very heterogeneous , ranging from mostly indolent , atrophic gastritis-associated , type I neuroendocrine tumors ( NETs) , through highly malignant , poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas ( pdNECs) , to sporadic type III NETs with intermediate prognosis , and various rare tumor types. Histologic differentiation , proliferative grade , size , level of gastric wall invasion , and local or distant metastases are used as prognostic markers. However , their value remains to be tailored to specific gastric NENs. Series of type I NETs ( n = 123 cases) , type III NETs ( n = 34 cases) , and pdNECs ( n = 43 cases) were retrospectively collected from four pathology centers specializing in endocrine pathology. All cases were characterized clinically and histopathologically. During follow-up ( median 93 months) data were recorded to assess disease-specific patient survival. Type I NETs , type III NETs , and pdNECs differed markedly in terms of tumor size , grade , invasive and metastatic power , as well as patient outcome. Size was used to stratify type I NETs into subgroups with significantly different invasive and metastatic behavior. All 70 type I NETs < 0.5 cm ( micro-NETs) were uneventful. Ki67-based grading proved efficient for the prognostic stratification of type III NETs; however , grade 2 ( G2) was not associated with tumor behavior in type I NETs. Although G3 NETs ( 2 type I and 9 type III) had a very poor prognosis , it was found that patient survival was longer with type III G3 NETs compared to pdNECs. Given the marked , tumor type-related behavior differences , evaluation of gastric NEN prognostic parameters should be tailored to the type of neoplastic disease.
