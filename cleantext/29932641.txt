  Melatonin is an important hormone whose functions span from regulating circadian rhythm in the brain to providing anti-inflammatory properties in the immune system. Melatonin secretion from the pineal gland is known; however , the mechanism of melatonin signaling in the immune system is not well understood. The lymph node is the hub of the immune system , and melatonin secretion from lymphocytes was proposed to be an important source specifically for regulating cytokine secretion. Methods exist to quantify the concentration of melatonin within biological samples; however , they often suffer from either a lack of selectivity for melatonin over common biological interferences or temporal resolution , which is not amenable to measuring real-time signaling dynamics. Here , we have characterized an electrochemical method for optimal melatonin detection with subsecond resolution using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes. The oxidation peaks detected for melatonin were at 1.0 , 1.1 , and 0.6 V. Evidence for electrode fouling of the tertiary peak was present; therefore , an optimized waveform was developed scanning from 0.2 to 1.3 V at 600 V/s. The optimized waveform eliminated the detection of fouling products on the electrode with a 24 Â± 10 nM limit of detection. Melatonin was distinguished between biological interferences , and codetection with the major synthetic precursor , serotonin , was possible. This method was used to detect melatonin in live lymph node slices and provides the first real-time measurements within the lymph node using FSCV. Real-time detection of melatonin dynamics could provide useful information on the mechanism of immunomodulation during
