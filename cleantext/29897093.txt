  Despite their high power conversion efficiency , the commercial applications of hybrid organic-inorganic lead ( Pb) halide perovskite based solar cells are still hampered by concerns about the toxicity of Pb and the structural stability in open air. Herein , based on density-functional theory computation , we show that lead-free tin ( Sn) and germanium ( Ge) based two-dimensional ( 2D) Ruddlesden-Popper hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with a thickness of a few unit-cells , BA2MAn-1MnI3n +1 ( M = Sn or Ge , n = 2-4) , possess desirable electronic , excitonic and light absorption properties , thereby showing promise for photovoltaic and/or photoelectronic applications. In particular , we show that by increasing the layer thickness of the Sn-based 2D perovskites , the bandgap can be lowered towards the optimal range ( 0.9-1.6 eV) for solar cells. Meanwhile , the exciton binding energy is reduced to a more optimal value. In addition , theoretical assessment indicates that the thermodynamic stability of Sn-/ Ge-based 2D perovskites is notably enhanced compared to that of their 3D analogues. These features render the Sn-/ Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites with a thickness of a few tens of unit cells promising lead-free perovskites with much improved structural stabilities for photovoltaic and/or photoelectronic applications.
