  To quantitatively assess changes in cartilage matrix after acute anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) rupture using T2- and T2 Twenty-three patients and 23 healthy controls were enrolled and underwent quantitative MRI examination. The knee cartilage was segmented into six compartments , including lateral femur ( LF) , lateral tibia ( LT) , medial femur ( MF) , medial tibia ( MT) , trochlea ( Tr) , and patella ( Pa). T2 and T2 ACL-ruptured patients showed higher T2 and T2 The early degeneration could occur in various knee cartilage compartments after acute ACL rupture , especially in the superficial layer of LT.
