  Limited availability of allele-level HLA genotypes prompts their imputation from allele-group genotypes to estimate epitope mismatches. We evaluated the accuracy of epitope load and repertoire assignment when imputing allele-level HLA genotypes. Analyses were conducted on 175 hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC) donors from the Héma-Québec registry ( HQR) and 57 HSC donor-recipient pairs from McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC) , Québec , Canada , genotyped for HLA-A ,- B ,- C ,- DRB1 and- DQB1. Multi-locus allele-level imputation was performed using HaploStats. Disagreement in B- and T-cell epitope assignment and epitope mismatches were ascertained for imputed vs. measured allele-level HLA genotypes in HSC donors and donor-recipient pairs , respectively. Imputation resulted in no differences in overall eplet mismatches and PIRCHE-II for HLA-A ,- B , and- C in 83.4 % and 93.7 % of HQR donors and 87.7 % and 87.7 % of MUHC donors , respectively. HLA-DRB1- and- DQB1-derived eplet mismatches and PIRCHE-II were correctly assigned in 72.0 % and 85.1 % of HQR donors and 70.2 % and 71.9 % of MUHC donors , respectively. No discrepancies in eplet load or PIRCHE-II were observed in 96.5 % and 86.0 % of HSC donor-recipient pairs and in 70.2 % and 70.1 % of pairs for HLA-A ,- B and- C and- DRB1 and- DQB1 , respectively. Kappa statistics of 0.9708 and 0.9725 , 0.8724 and 0.8177 , 0.9827 and 0.9022 , 0.5644 and 0.4939 , 0.5085 and 0.6361 were demonstrated when assessing agreement between eplet mismatches and PIRCHE-II of imputed vs. measured HLA-A ,- B ,- C ,- DRB1 and- DQB1 types , respectively. To avoid inaccuracies in epitope compatibility estimation , mainly for class II HLA , multi-locus allele-level genotype measurement is recommended. This article is protected by copyright.
