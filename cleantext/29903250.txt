  To analyze the changing trend of children 's malnutrition and anemia<symptom> rate in Taicang City , Jiangsu Province from 2009 to 2015. Data of medical examination on children under 3 was retrived from Electronic Health Care Records in Taicang , Jiangsu , and children 's malnutrition and anemia<symptom> rates were assessed based on WHO children 's growth standard in 2006 and anemia<symptom> diagnosis standard in 2001. The differences of children 's malnutrition and anemia<symptom> rates from 2009 to 2015 were analyzed based on the data. The Mantel-Haenszel Estimation Method was used to standardize themalnutrition rate and the anemia<symptom> rate. Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square test was used to compare the differences of count data. The average WAZ , HAZ and WHZ scores were 0. 51 , 0. 23 and 0. 56 , and the average rates of low weight , stunting , wasting , overweight and obesity were 0. 65 % , 1. 54 % , 0. 56 % , 6. 37 % and 1. 03 % , respectively. The rates of low weight , wasting , overweight and obesity remained stable from 2009 to 2015. The overweight rate increased from 5. 84 % in 2009 to 6. 99 % in2012 , and dropped to 6. 12 % in 2015 ( MH Ï‡ ~ 2 = 5. 41 , P < 0. 05). The boys had a higher malnutrition rate than the girls , and the migrant children had worse conditions in stunting , overweight and obesity than local children. The anemia<symptom> rate in children under 3 declined from 24. 02 % in 2009 to 9. 25 % in 2015 ( Cochran-Armitage Z = 29. 41 , P < 0. 05). The boys had a higher anemia<symptom> rate than the girls , and the local children had a higher anemia<symptom> rate than the migrant children. The growth status of children under 3 in Taicang from 2009 to 2015 is better than the WHO reference standards. The overweight rates increase from 2009 to 2012 and decline from 2012 to 2015. The anemia<symptom> rate in children decline from 2009 to 2015. This study indicates that controlling the high overweight rate and high anemia<symptom> rate in young children under 3 are two predominating working directions in Taicang , Jiangsu.
