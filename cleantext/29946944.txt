  Venous thromboembolism ( VTE) is a major public health issue; deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) affects about 1/1000 patients. Each year , VTE kills more patients in Western Europe than breast cancer , prostate cancer , acquired immune deficiency syndrome<disease> ( AIDS) and road traffic accidents combined and is responsible for the deaths of approximately 370,000 European citizens ( Cohen et al. in Thromb Haemost 98:756-764 , 2007; Bĕlohlávek et al. in Exp Clin Cardiol 18 ( 2): 129-138 , 2013). The recently published ATTRACT trial ( Acute Venous Thrombosis Thrombus Removal with Adjunctive Catheter-directed Thrombolysis) ( Vedantham et al. in N Engl J Med 377:2240-2252 , 2017) concluded that the addition of catheter-directed thrombolysis to standard therapy with anticoagulation and compression stockings offers no significant clinical benefit over standard therapy in terms of reduction in the rate of post-thrombotic syndrome<disease> ( PTS) at 2 years. It is the largest , prospective , multi-centre , randomised controlled trial ( RCT) and represents the culmination over a decade of planning , execution and analysis. In this opinion article , we analyse why it was needed , what it demonstrated , some limitations , and the directions in which this important publication will take us.
