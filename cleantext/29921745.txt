  This is the first reported case of severe hand hematoma after cardiac catheterization through the distal radial artery , with the hematoma extending distally to the sheath insertion site. The distribution of the hematoma in our case is completely different compared to the hematomas observed after traditional radial catheterization , which used to extend to the forearm. Therefore , the traditional EASY classification may not apply to hematomas after catheterization through the distal radial artery.
