  Recently , the direct intratumoral ( i.t.) injection of anticancer agents has been investigated. A newly synthesized Antineoplaston A10 analog 3- ( 4-methoxybenzoylamino) -2,6-piperidinedione ( MPD) showed an antitumor activity in human breast cancer cell line. Unfortunately , MPD suffered from poor water solubility. Pseudoternary phase diagram of oil ( isopropyl myristate) , surfactant ( Tween 80) , cosurfactant ( ethanol) , and water was plotted. MPD microemulsion ( MPDME) was developed and characterized for particle size ( PS) , polydispersity index ( PDI) , zeta potential ( ZP) , and morphology ( transmission electron microscopy). MPDME and MPD solution ( MPDS) were radiolabeled with technetium 99m (
