  Additive manufacturing also known as 3D printing is being utilised in electrochemistry to reproducibly develop complex geometries with conductive properties. In this study , we explored if the electrochemical behavior of 3D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS)/ carbon black electrodes was influenced by printing direction. The electrodes were printed in both horizontal and vertical directions. The horizsontal direction resulted in a smooth surface ( HPSS electrode) and a comparatively rougher surface ( HPRS electrode) surface. Electrodes were characterized using cyclic voltammetry , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. For various redox couples , the vertical printed ( VP) electrode showed enhanced current response when compared the two electrode surfaces generated by horizontal print direction. No differences in the capacitive response was observed , indicating that the conductive surface area of all types of electrodes were identical. The VP electrode had reduced charge transfer resistance and uncompensated solution resistance when compared to the HPSS and HPRS electrodes. Overall , electrodes printed in a vertical direction provide enhanced electrochemical performance and our study indicates that print orientation is a key factor that can be used to enhance sensor performance.
