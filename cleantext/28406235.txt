  Melittin , the main active peptide ingredient of bee venom , can cause severe cell membrane lysis due to its robust interaction with negatively charged phospholipids. So far , no effective anti-melittin vaccine has been developed to protect people from undesired melittin intoxication. Herein , we prepared a polydiacetylene ( PDA) nanoparticle with cell membrane-mimic surface to complex melittin , forming an anti-melittin vaccine ( PDA-melittin). PDA nanoparticles could effectively combine with melittin and neutralize its toxicity. PDA-melittin nanocomplex is demonstrated to enhance melittin uptake by DCs and stimulate strong melittin-specific immunity. Mice immunized with PDA-melittin nanocomplex showed higher survival rate after exposion to melittin than untreated mice. The PDA-melittin nanocomplex can efficiently and safely generate a specific immunity against melittin to protect body from melittin intoxication , providing a new method with potential clinical application for the treatment of melittin intoxication.
