  Spatial pattern formation is a critical issue in developmental biology. Gene expression boundary sharpening has been observed from both experiments and modeling simulations. However , the mechanism to determine the sharpness of the boundary is not fully elucidated. We investigated the boundary sharpening resulted by three biological motifs , interacting with morphogens , and uncovered their probabilistic landscapes. The landscape view , along with calculated average switching time between attractors , provides a natural explanation for the boundary sharpening behavior relying on the noise induced gene state switchings. To possess boundary sharpening potential , a gene network needs to generate an asymmetric bistable state , i.e. one of the two stable states is less stable than the other. We found that the mutual repressed self-activation model displays more robust boundary sharpening ability against parameter perturbation , compared to the mutual repression or the self-activation model. This is supported by the results of switching time calculated from the landscape , which indicate that the mutual repressed self-activation model has shortest switching time , among three models. Additionally , introducing cross gradients of morphogens provides a more stable mechanism for the boundary sharpening of gene expression , due to a two-way switching mechanism. Our results reveal the underlying principle for the gene expression boundary sharpening , and pave the way for the mechanistic understanding of cell fate decisions in the pattern formation processes of development.
