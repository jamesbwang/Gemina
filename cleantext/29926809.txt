  In order to facilitate the broad applications of molecular recognition materials in biomedical areas , it is critical to enhance their adsorption capacity while maintaining their excellent recognition performance. In this work , we designed and synthesized well-defined peptide-imprinted mesoporous silica ( PIMS) for specific recognition of an immunostimulating hexapeptide from human casein ( IHHC) by using amphiphilic ionic liquid as the surfactant to anchor IHHC via a combination of one-step sol-gel method and docking oriented imprinting approach. Thereinto , theoretical calculation was employed to reveal the multiple binding interactions and dual-template configuration between amphiphilic ionic liquid and IHHC. The fabricated PIMS was characterized and an in-depth analysis of specific recognition mechanism was conducted. Results revealed that both adsorption and recognition capabilities of PIMS far exceeded that of the NIMS 's. More significantly , the PIMS exhibited a superior binding capacity ( 60.5 mg g
