  This study aims to determine the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in prosthetists/orthotists working in Australia. Secondary to this , the relationship between work-related hazards and work-related musculoskeletal disorders will be examined. In 2012 a self-report survey was conducted with the prosthetist/orthotist workforce in Australia ( N = 139 , 56 % response rate). Data on workplace physical and psychosocial hazards , job satisfaction , work life balance<symptom> and musculoskeletal discomfort were collected. Predictors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders was 80 %. Gender ( β = 1.31 , p = 0.03) , total weekly hours ( β = 0.9 , p < 0.01) , Physical ( β = 1.91 , p < 0.01) and Psychosocial ( β = 1.28 , p < 0.01) hazards were all associated with reporting of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Females reported higher levels of work-related musculoskeletal disorder discomfort than males in all body areas. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders prevalence is high in prosthetists/orthotists. This suggests that focus on work place injury prevention is required. Targeted prevention requires systematic identification and then control of all relevant workplace hazards.
