  Data found in this article include the structures of the orphan tear lipids and their analogs that are binding candidates to tear lipocalin , the mass spectrum of products of collision induced dissociation of putative synthesized compounds of synthesized ( O-oleoyl) -16 hydroxypalmitic acid. These data and analyses support the research article `` Interaction of ceramides and tear lipocalin '' Glasgow et al. ( 2018) ( 1).
