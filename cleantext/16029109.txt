  The challenge for those treating or witnessing pain is to find a way of crossing the chasm of meaning between them and the person living with pain. This paper proposes that images can strengthen agency in the person with pain , particularly but not only in the clinical setting , and can create a shared space within which to negotiate meaning. It draws on multidisciplinary analyses of unique material resulting from two fine art/medical collaborations in London , UK , in which the invisible experience of pain was made visible in the form of co-created photographic images , which were then made available to other patients as a resource to use in specialist consultations. In parallel with the pain encounters it describes , the paper weaves together the insights of specialists from a range of disciplines whose methodologies and priorities sometimes conflict and sometimes intersect to make sense of each other 's findings. A short section of video footage where images were used in a pain consultation is examined in fine detail from the perspective of each discipline. The analysis shows how the images function as ` transactional objects ' and how their use coincides with an increase in the amount of talk and emotional disclosure on the part of the patient and greater non-verbal affiliative behaviour on the part of the doctor. These findings are interpreted from the different disciplinary perspectives , to build a complex picture of the multifaceted , contradictory and paradoxical nature of pain experience , the drive to communicate it and the potential role of visual images in clinical settings.
