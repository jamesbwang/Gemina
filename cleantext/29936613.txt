  Ultraviolet A ( UVA) , the major component of solar UV irradiation , is an important environmental factor inducing damage to insects including cell death , photoreceptor damage , and oxidative stress. In order to improve understanding of the adaptation mechanisms of insect after UVA exposure , a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out to reveal differential protein expression in Ostrinia furnacalis. Three-day-old adults were treated with UVA for 1 h. Total proteins of control and UVA-treated insects were examined using two-dimensional electrophoresis ( 2-DE). 2-DE analysis demonstrated that 19 proteins were increased and 18 proteins were decreased significantly in O. furnacalis after UVA exposure , respectively. Thirty differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified by mass spectrometry. The identified proteins were involved in diverse biological processes , such as signal transduction , transport processing , cellular stress , metabolisms , and cytoskeleton organization. Our results reveal that the response patterns of O. furnacalis to UVA irradiation are complex and provide novel insights into the adaptation response to UVA irradiation stress.
