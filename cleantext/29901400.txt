  A highly efficient copper ( I)- catalyzed asymmetric 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides with 3-silyl unsaturated esters has been developed , providing elegant access to chiral 3-silylpyrrolidine derivatives bearing contiguous stereogenic centers in moderate-to-excellent yields ( up to 99 %) with high diastereo- and enantioselectivities ( dr up to > 99:1; ee up to 96 %). Notably , the 3-silylpyrrolidines can easily be converted to pyrrolidine azasugar derivatives with potential biological activities by the reduction of two ester groups and carbon-silicon bond oxidation.
