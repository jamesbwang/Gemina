  Transitioning from a metabolically quiescent naive B cell to an antibody-secreting plasmablast requires division-dependent cellular differentiation. Though cell division demands significant ATP and metabolites , the metabolic processes used for ATP synthesis during plasmablast formation are not well described. Here , the metabolic requirements for plasmablast formation were determined. Following T-independent stimulation with lipopolysaccharide , B cells increased expression of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery in a stepwise manner. Such activated B cells have increased capacity to perform oxidative phosphorylation but showed dependency on glycolysis. Plasmablasts displayed higher oxidative metabolism to support antibody secretion , as inhibiting oxidative ATP production resulted in decreased antibody titers. Differentiation by Blimp1 was required for this increase in oxidative metabolism , as Blimp1-deficient cells proliferate but do not upregulate oxidative phosphorylation. Together , these findings identify a shift in metabolic pathways as B cells differentiate , as well as the requirement for increased metabolic potential to support antibody production.
