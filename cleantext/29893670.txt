  Our objective is to summarize our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of Lambl 's excrescence ( LE) on the aortic valve. Methods: The clinical data of 25 patients with LE admitted to our hospital from January 2010 to December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 17 males and 8 females , with the mean age of 55.7 ± 11.43 years ( range: 30 to 70 years). Among the patients analyzed , eight also had cerebral embolism. All of the patients were diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE). In seven cases , surgical treatment to remove the excrescence was successfully performed. Results: All 25 patients were cured and discharged. There were no complications or operative mortalities in the seven patients that underwent surgical treatment. Follow-ups were performed for all patients for an average of 2.9 ± 1.5 years. During this time , none had a new cerebrovascular accident ( CVA). Conclusions: Most patients with LE are asymptomatic , though some patients showed repeated episodes of stroke. We recommend TEE as the main diagnostic means of the disease. Patients with LE that have experienced two or more CVAs or combined other heart disease and need open heart surgery should be offered surgical excision of the excrescences. Other patients should be treated conservatively with anticoagulation , or monitored closely.
