  Psychiatric disorders entail maladaptive processes impairing individuals ' ability to appropriately interface with environment. Among them , depression<symptom> is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms including hopelessness and anhedonia , dramatically impacting the propensity to live a social and active life and seriously affecting working capability. Relevantly , besides genetic predisposition , foremost risk factors are stress-related , such as experiencing chronic psychosocial stress-including bullying , mobbing and abuse- , and undergoing economic crisis or chronic illnesses. In the last few years the field of epigenetics promised to understand core mechanisms of gene-environment crosstalk , contributing to get into pathogenic processes of many disorders highly influenced by stressful life conditions. However , still very little is known about mechanisms that tune gene expression to adapt to the external milieu. In this Perspective article , we discuss a set of protective , functionally convergent epigenetic processes induced by acute stress in the rodent hippocampus and devoted to the negative modulation of stress-induced immediate early genes ( IEGs) transcription , hindering stress-driven morphostructural modifications of corticolimbic circuitry. We also suggest that chronic stress damaging protective epigenetic mechanisms , could bias the functional trajectory of stress-induced neuronal morphostructural modification from adaptive to maladaptive , contributing to the onset of depression<symptom> in vulnerable individuals. A better understanding of the epigenetic response to stress will be pivotal to new avenues of therapeutic intervention to treat depression<symptom> , especially in light of limited efficacy of available antidepressant drugs.
