  Virtual Reality ( VR) has been rapidly recognized and implemented in construction engineering education and training ( CEET) in recent years due to its benefits of providing an engaging and immersive environment. The objective of this review is to critically collect and analyze the VR applications in CEET , aiming at all VR-related journal papers published from 1997 to 2017. The review follows a three-stage analysis on VR technologies , applications and future directions through a systematic analysis. It is found that the VR technologies adopted for CEET evolve over time , from desktop-based VR , immersive VR , 3D game-based VR , to Building Information Modelling ( BIM)- enabled VR. A sibling technology , Augmented Reality ( AR) , for CEET adoptions has also emerged in recent years. These technologies have been applied in architecture and design visualization , construction health and safety training , equipment and operational task training , as well as structural analysis. Future research directions , including the integration of VR with emerging education paradigms and visualization technologies , have also been provided. The findings are useful for both researchers and educators to usefully integrate VR in their education and training programs to improve the training performance.
