  Introduction: In Head and Neck ( HN) cancer , the High-Risk Human<pathogen> Papillomavirus<pathogen> ( hr HPV<pathogen>) infection has been associated in about 40 % of these tumors. The hr HPV<pathogen> infection is one of the etiological factors of several epithelial tumors; however , its association with the prognosis has not yet been established for patients with Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( LSCC). On the other hand , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR) is a molecular marker widely studied in cancer and its overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis in some types of cancer , including the HN cancer. In the present study , we analyzed EGFR expression and HPV<pathogen> detection in a cohort of Mexican patients with LSCC and define their association with clinical-pathological and survival parameters. Methods: EGFR expression analysis was performed by immunohistochemistry assay. A tissue array was constructed based on 30 paraffin-embedded tissue samples. HPV<pathogen> detection was performed by PCR. The results were then compared with the clinical-pathological variables and outcome measures ( Kaplan Meier and Cox analysis). Results: High expression of EGFR was observed in 43 % of the samples and 20 % of HPV<pathogen> detection. The statistical analyses provided evidence of disassociation between clinical-pathological parameters and EGFR expression , but there was an association with poor prognosis. Interestingly , HPV<pathogen> detection is slightly associated with good prognosis. Conclusion: Both , EGFR overexpression and HPV<pathogen> presence could be associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with LSCC , independently of other clinical-pathological factors.
