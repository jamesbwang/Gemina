  We set out to review the current state of science in neuroprediction , using biological measures of brain function , with task based fMRI to prospectively predict response to a variety of treatments. Task-based fMRI neuroprediction studies are balanced between whole brain and ROI specific analyses. The predominant tasks are emotion processing , with ROIs based upon amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate gyrus , both within the salience and emotion network. A rapidly emerging new area of neuroprediction is of disease course and illness recurrence. Concerns include use of open-label and single arm studies , lack of consideration of placebo effects , unbalanced adjustments for multiple comparisons ( over focus on type I error) , small sample sizes , unreported effect sizes , overreliance on ROI studies. There is a need to adjust neuroprediction study reporting so that greater coherence can facilitate meta analyses , and increased funding for more multiarm studies in neuroprediction.
