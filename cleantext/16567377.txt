  Functional disability is defined as the need for assistance with self-care tasks. To document changes in functional status over time among older prevalent renal transplant recipients. Single center , prospective , follow-up study. Single center , tertiary care transplant center. Patients , with a functioning kidney transplant , aged 65 years or older who underwent assessment of functional status approximately 12 months previously. Validated tools used included Barthel Index , the Lawton-Brody Scale of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living , the Timed Up and Go test , the Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire , the Mini-Cog , and dynamometer handgrip strength. Outpatient assessment by a trained observer. Of the 82 patients previously studied , 64 ( 78 %) patients participated in the follow-up study ( mean age 70.5 Â± 4.4 years , 58 % male , 55 % diabetic). Among those completing functional status measures , 32 ( 50 %) had functional disability at baseline. Over the 1-year period , 11 ( 17 %) of these patients experienced progressive functional decline , 6 ( 9 %) exhibited no change , and 15 ( 23 %) had functional recovery. Eleven patients ( 17 %) initially independent , developed new-onset disability. One of the strongest predictors of progressive functional decline was having 1 or more falls in the previous year. Assessments were performed only on 2 occasions separated by approximately 1 year. Fluctuations in disability states are common among older adults living with renal transplants. Episodes of functional disability may place individuals at higher risk of persistent and/or progressive disability.
