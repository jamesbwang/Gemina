  The unicellular green microalga Haematococcus pluvialis has the highest content of the natural antioxidant , astaxanthin. Previously , it was determined that astaxanthin accumulation in H. pluvialis could be induced by blue-wavelength irradiation; however , the molecular mechanism remains unknown. The present study aimed to compare the transcriptome of H. pluvialis , with respect to astaxanthin biosynthesis , under the monochromatic red ( 660 nm) or blue ( 450 nm) light-emitting diode ( LED) irradiation. Among a total of 165,372 transcripts , we identified 67,703 unigenes , of which 2245 and 171 were identified as differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) in response to blue and red irradiation , respectively. Interestingly , expressional changes of blue light receptor cryptochromes were detected in response to blue and/or red LED irradiation in H. pluvialis , which may directly and indirectly regulate astaxanthin biosynthesis. In accordance with this observation , expression of the BKT and CHY genes , which are part of the downstream section of the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway , was significantly upregulated by blue LED irradiation compared with their expression under control white irradiation. Contrastingly , they were downregulated by red LED irradiation. Our transcriptome study provided molecular insights that highlighted the different of responses of H. pluvialis to red and blue irradiation , especially for astaxanthin biosynthesis.
