  To characterize associations between genetic and neuroimaging data , a variety of analytic methods have been proposed in neuroimaging genetic studies. These methods have achieved promising performance by taking into account inherent correlation in either the neuroimaging data or the genetic data alone. In this study , we propose a novel robust reduced rank graph regression based method in a linear regression framework by considering correlations inherent in neuroimaging data and genetic data jointly. Particularly , we model the association analysis problem in a reduced rank regression framework with the genetic data as a feature matrix and the neuroimaging data as a response matrix by jointly considering correlations among the neuroimaging data as well as correlations between the genetic data and the neuroimaging data. A new graph representation of genetic data is adopted to exploit their inherent correlations , in addition to robust loss functions for both the regression and the data representation tasks , and a square-root-operator applied to the robust loss functions for achieving adaptive sample weighting. The resulting optimization problem is solved using an iterative optimization method whose convergence has been theoretically proved. Experimental results on the Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ( ADNI) dataset have demonstrated that our method could achieve competitive performance in terms of regression performance between brain structural measures and the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs) , compared with state-of-the-art alternative methods.
