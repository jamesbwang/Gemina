  A new pretreatment method using room-temperature ionic liquid ( IL) was proposed for observing wood specimens in scanning electron microscopy ( SEM). A variety of concentrations were examined for ethanol solution of the IL , ( Emim) ( MePO3Me) , to determine an optimal pretreatment procedure. It was concluded that 10 % ethanol solution of the IL was the most adequate to acquire good SEM images. Using the procedure optimized , SEM images were taken for typical anatomical types of modern soft and hardwood species and archeological wood. SEM images taken were sufficiently good in observing wood cells. The pretreatment method was also effective to archeological wood dated ca. 1600 years ago. It was thus concluded that the method developed in this study is more useful than those conventionally used. Additionally , pretreatment at the high temperature was performed to confirm morphological changes in softwood. Deformation of latewood cells ( tracheids) was occurred by treating with undiluted IL at the high temperature of 50 Â°C , probably due to higher accessibility of the IL into intercellular space. Nonetheless , it was confirmed that this happens under far more extreme conditions than our proposed method.
