  Ciliates are one of the eukaryotic unicellular organisms which are thought to be the oldest life forms , and widely geographically distributed. For a variety of reasons , some groups of ciliates have attracted more attention than others , such as the class Spirotrichea and related species with its complicated evolutionary relationships. In this study , we obtained the transcriptome data of three typical ciliates , Uroleptopsis citrina , Euplotes vannus , Protocruzia tuzeti using high throughput sequencing. The genetic relationships were revealed by phylogenomic analysis of 109 genes comprising of 34,882 amino acid residues , and analyses based on SSU rDNA of 55 species , as well as the comparison of gene content among spirotricheans and related species. Our phylogenomic analyses show the Spirotrichea is monophyletic when Protocruzia is excluded , in which four subclasses: Oligotrichia , Choreotrichia , Hypotrichia and Euplotia also formed momophyletic groups respectively. The Hypotrichia was placed as a sister branch to the assemblage , in which two oligotrichs clustered with two choreotrichs. In addition to this , the Protocruziidia was placed in an independent lineage status out of the Spirotrichea. Together with its high binding-related gene content compared to other species and the significant variation in morphological characters , these findings support the removal of Protocruzia from the class Spirotrichea.
