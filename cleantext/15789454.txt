  New Zealand blackcurrant ( NZBC) extract increased 16.1 km cycling time trial performance. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of NZBC extract on 2 × 4 km time trial performance. Ten male cyclists ( age: 30 ± 12 years , body mass: 74 ± 9 kg , height: 179 ± 7 cm , body fat: 11 ± 3 % , ( V̇) ̇O2max: 55 ± 7 mL • kg-1 • min-1 , mean ± SD) volunteered. Participants were familiarized with the time trials. Participants consumed capsulated NZBC extract ( 300 mg ∙ day-1 CurraNZ ™; containing 105 mg anthocyanin) or placebo for seven days ( double blind , randomised , cross-over design , wash-out at least seven days) before 2 × 4 km time trials ( 10 min active self-paced recovery between trials) ( SRM ergometer , SRM International , Germany). Heart rate was recorded and blood lactate sampled immediately after each trial and 8 min into recovery between the trials. Times over comparable one km distances in each 4 km time trial were similar. No effect was observed for the time to complete the first ( placebo: 380 ± 28 s , NZBC: 377 ± 27 s) and second 4 km of cycling ( placebo: 391 ± 32 s , NZBC: 387 ± 30 s) , within both groups the second 4 km times slower by 11 ± 8 s and 11 ± 9 s for placebo and NZBC , respectively. However , the total time of the two 4 km cycling trials was 0.82 % faster with NZBC extract ( placebo: 771 ± 60 s , NZBC 764 ± 56 s , p = 0.034) with seven participants having faster total times. There was no effect of NZBC on heart rate and lactate values at identical time points. New Zealand blackcurrant extract seems to be beneficial in repeated short-distance cycling time trials for overall performance.
