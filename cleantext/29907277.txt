  Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients on durable left ventricular assist device support experience improved survival , quality of life , and exercise capacity. The complication rate , however , remains unacceptably high , although it has declined with improvements in pump design , better patient selection , and greater understanding of the pump physiology and flow dynamics. Most complications are categorized as those related to the pump-patient interface or those related to patient physiology. It is hoped that further engineering progress , and better patient selection through risk stratification , will allow for left ventricular assist device to be totally biocompatible and perform effectively , without affecting biology and homeostasis of the different organ systems.
