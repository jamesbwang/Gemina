  Right retroperitoneal splenosis is rare with few reported cases. We report , here , the case of simultaneous peritoneal and retroperitoneal splenosis mimics metastatic right adrenal mass. A 28-year-old man who had previously undergone post traumatic splenectomy at childhood and subsequently presented with an large incidental non-functioning right adrenal mass with presence of extra-hepatic peritoneal focal lesion<symptom> diagnosed as metastasis by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). Adrenalectomy with metatstectomy was performed , and both masses were identified to be splenosis. Adrenal incidentalomas ( AIs) is defined as asymptomatic masses > 1 cm. on cross-sectional imaging studies. AIs have significant malignant potential for masses > 6 cm. Splenosis are found most frequently in the left retroperitoneum in cases involving retroperitoneal splenosis. However , right retroperitoneal splenosis have been reported. Traditional imaging techniques can not differentiate splenosis from malignancy. Large right adrenal incidentalomas present with other abdominal , peritoneal masses could be splenosis in patient following post-traumatic splenectomy.
