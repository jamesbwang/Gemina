  Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 is one of the subunits of transmembrane receptor for interleukin-13. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression in invasive breast cancer. Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays of 1283 invasive breast cancer samples , and associations between these expressions and clinicopathological variables and clinical outcomes were investigated. Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression was observed in 138 ( 10.8 %) samples , and found to be associated with positive estrogen receptor ( p < 0.001) and progesterone receptor ( p < 0.001) and with the luminal subtype ( p < 0.001). No significant association was found between interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression and other clinicopathological variables including age , tumor size , lymph node metastasis , histologic types , histologic grade , HER2 status , Ki-67 labeling index , or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels. Patients with interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression tended to have poorer disease-free survival , but the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.069). Subgroup analysis showed luminal breast cancer patients positive for interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression had significantly poorer disease-free survival ( p = 0.018) than luminal breast cancer patients negative for interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression. However , no association between interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression and clinical outcome was observed in HER2-positive and triple-negative subgroups ( p = 0.574 and p = 0.936 , respectively). Multivariate analysis showed interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for luminal breast cancer ( p = 0.03). This study shows interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression could be a useful prognostic marker for selecting patients with luminal breast cancer likely to follow a clinically aggressive course despite receiving systemic therapy.
