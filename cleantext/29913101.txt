  Sixteen patients with mild anemia<symptom> and hemolysis<symptom> were difficult to be classified into any known category based on laboratory examinations and light microscopy. To make a definite diagnosis and investigate the pathomechanism , ultrastructural study was performed on erythroid cells from 16 patients. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated a series of alterations of cytoplasm , including cytoplasm sequestration , membranous transformation , and degeneration in erythroblasts and reticulocytes at different stages. The affected erythroblasts were usually complicated with chromatin condensation , karyorrhexis , nuclear membrane lysis , and megaloblastic changes. The reticulocytes with the cytoplasm alterations had a huge size from 10 um to 15 um in diameter. The membranous cytoplasm degeneration revealed a unique pathomechanism of dyserythropoiesis and ineffective erythropoiesis in 16 patients with anemia<symptom> , and suggested a novel anemia<symptom> category though more details remained to be investigated.
