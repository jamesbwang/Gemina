  A tendon transfers force from the contracting muscle<symptom> to the skeletal system to produce movement and is therefore a crucial component of the entire muscle-tendon complex and its function. However , tendon research has for some time focused on mechanical properties without any major appreciation of potential cellular and molecular changes. At the same time , methodological developments have permitted determination of the mechanical properties of human tendons in vivo , which was previously not possible. Here we review the current understanding of how tendons respond to loading , unloading , ageing and injury from cellular , molecular and mechanical points of view. A mechanistic understanding of tendon tissue adaptation will be vital for development of adequate guidelines in physical training and rehabilitation , as well as for optimal injury treatment.
