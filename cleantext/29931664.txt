  Calcium and vitamin D are essential for maintaining bone health. Therefore , deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D are major risk factors for osteoporosis development. Because sufficient amounts of calcium are also required for fracture-callus mineralisation , compromised bone repair that is frequently observed in osteoporotic patients might be attributed to calcium and vitamin D deficiencies. Consequently , calcium and vitamin D supplementation represents a potential strategy for treating compromised fracture healing in osteoporotic patients. Growing clinical evidence suggests that a fracture event may induce post-traumatic bone loss in the non-fractured skeleton , particularly in osteoporotic patients , which might further exacerbate osteoporosis and increase the risk of secondary fractures. Because the skeleton represents the main source of calcium , which is increasingly required during fracture-callus mineralisation , post-traumatic calcium mobilisation might occur under conditions of insufficient calcium and vitamin D status. However , to date , investigations of the roles of calcium and vitamin D in bone repair and post-traumatic bone turnover are very limited. The current review summarises the state of the literature , focusing on the role of calcium and vitamin D in fracture healing and post-traumatic bone turnover , and critically discusses the therapeutic potential of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in this context.
