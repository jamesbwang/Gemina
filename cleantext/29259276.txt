  Quantifying the relationship between tree diameter and height is a key component of efforts to estimate biomass and carbon stocks in tropical forests. Although substantial site-to-site variation in height-diameter allometries has been documented , the time consuming nature of measuring all tree heights in an inventory plot means that most studies do not include height , or else use generic pan-tropical or regional allometric equations to estimate height.Using a pan-tropical dataset of 73 plots where at least 150 trees had in-field ground-based height measurements , we examined how the number of trees sampled affects the performance of locally derived height-diameter allometries , and evaluated the performance of different methods for sampling trees for height measurement.Using cross-validation , we found that allometries constructed with just 20 locally measured values could often predict tree height with lower error than regional or climate-based allometries ( mean reduction in prediction error = 0.46 m). The predictive performance of locally derived allometries improved with sample size , but with diminishing returns in performance gains when more than 40 trees were sampled. Estimates of stand-level biomass produced using local allometries to estimate tree height show no over- or under-estimation bias when compared with biomass estimates using field measured heights. We evaluated five strategies to sample trees for height measurement , and found that sampling strategies that included measuring the heights of the ten largest diameter trees in a plot outperformed ( in terms of resulting in local height-diameter models with low height prediction error) entirely random or diameter size-class stratified approaches.Our results indicate that even limited sampling of heights can be used to refine height-diameter allometries. We recommend aiming for a conservative threshold of sampling 50 trees per location for height measurement , and including the ten trees with the largest diameter in this sample.
