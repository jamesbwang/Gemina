  Increasing evidence has confirmed that nigral iron accumulation and activation of NMDA receptors ( NRs) contribute to the neurodegeneration of dopamine ( DA) neurons in Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Earlier work indicated that activation of NRs participated in iron metabolism in the hippocampus. However , the relationship between activation of NRs and iron accumulation in DA neurons of the substantia nigra in PD was unknown. In this study , our results showed that NRs inhibitors MK-801 and AP5 protected nigrostriatal projection system and reduced nigral iron levels of 6-hydroxydopamine ( 6-OHDA)- induced PD rats. In vitro studies demonstrated that NMDA treatment increased the expression of iron importer divalent metal transporter 1 ( DMT1) and decreased the expression of iron exporter ferropotin 1 ( Fpn1) , which were dependent on iron regulatory protein 1 ( IRP1). This led to increased intracellular iron levels and intensified the decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential in MES23 .5 dopaminergic neurons. In addition , we reported that MK801 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor could antagonize 6-OHDA-induced up-regulation of IRP1 and DMT1 and down-regulation of Fpn1 , thus attenuating 6-OHDA-induced iron accumulation in MES23 .5 cells. This suggested that 6-OHDA-induced activation of NRs might modulate the expression of DMT1 and Fpn1 via the neuronal nitric oxide synthase-IRP1 pathway.-Xu , H. , Liu , X. , Xia , J. , Yu , T. , Qu , Y. , Jiang , H. , Xie , J. , Activation of NMDA receptors mediated iron accumulation via modulating iron transporters in Parkinson 's disease.
