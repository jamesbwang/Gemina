  To ensure accurate DNA replication , a replisome must effectively overcome numerous obstacles on its DNA substrate. After encountering an obstacle , a progressing replisome often aborts DNA synthesis but continues to unwind. However , little is known about how DNA synthesis is resumed downstream of an obstacle. Here , we examine the consequences of a non-replicating replisome collision with a co-directional RNA polymerase ( RNAP). Using single-molecule and ensemble methods , we find that T7 helicase interacts strongly with a non-replicating T7 DNA polymerase ( DNAP) at a replication fork. As the helicase advances , the associated DNAP also moves forward. The presence of the DNAP increases both helicase 's processivity and unwinding rate. We show that such a DNAP , together with its helicase , is indeed able to actively disrupt a stalled transcription elongation complex , and then initiates replication using the RNA transcript as a primer. These observations exhibit T7 helicase 's novel role in replication re-initiation.
