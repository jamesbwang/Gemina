  Long non-coding RNAs are generally regarded as important regulators in various<disease> human<disease> diseases<disease>. As a lncRNA , HOXD-AS1 has been found to be a tumor promoter in ovarian cancer , glioma and lung cancer. However , the specific effects of HOXD-AS1 on the chemoresistance of cervical cancer cells are still not fully explored. Firstly , the level of HOXD-AS1 was tested in non-malignant tissues and CC tissues as well as in CC cells and cisplatin-resistant CC cells. As a result , HOXD-AS1 was overexpressed in CC tissues and cisplatin-resistant CC cells. Subsequently , loss-of function assays indicated that downregulation of HOXD-AS1 suppressed chemoresistance of cisplatin-resistant CC cells. Mechanism investigation revealed that miR-130a-3p was a target of HOXD-AS1. Gain-of function assays revealed that miR-130a-3p can reverse cisplatin resistance of CC-resistant CC cells. Similarly , ZEB1 was demonstrated to be a target of miR-130a-3p. Therefore , we confirmed that HOXD-AS1 can act as a ceRNA to upregulate ZEB1 through miR-130a-3p. The effects of HOXD-AS1-miR-130a-3p-ZEB1 axis on cisplatin resistance of cisplatin-resistant CC cells were demonstrated through conducting rescue assays. In summary , HOXD-AS1 enhanced chemoresistance of cisplatin-resistant CC cells through modulating miR-130a-3p/ ZEB1 axis.
