  Usher syndrome<disease> ( USH) is a common heterogeneous retinopathy and a hearing loss ( HL) syndrome<disease>. However , the gene causing Usher syndrome<disease> type IIC ( USH2C) in a consanguineous Chinese pedigree is unknown. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing analysis and Sanger sequencing to explore the GPR98 mutations in a USH2C pedigree that included a 32-year-old male patient from a consanguineous marriage family. Western blot verified the nonsense mutation. To identify disease-causing gene variants in a consanguineous Chinese pedigree with USH2C , DNA from proband was analyzed using targeted next generation sequencing ( NGS). The patient was clinically documented as a possible USH2 by a comprehensive auditory and ophthalmology evaluation. We succeeded in identifying the deleterious , novel , and homologous variant , c. 6912dupG ( p.Leu2305Valfs * 4) , in the GPR98 gene ( NM_032119.3) that contributes to the progression of USH2C. Variant detected by targeted NGS was then confirmed and co-segregation was conducted by direct Sanger sequencing. Western blot verified losing almost two-thirds of its amino acid residues , including partial Calx-beta , whole EPTP and 7TM-GPCRs at the C-terminus of GPR98. Furthermore , our results highlighted that this p.Leu2305Valfs * 4 variant is most likely pathogenic due to a large deletion at the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors ( 7TM-GPCRs) domain in GPR98 protein , leading to significantly decreased functionality and complex stability. These findings characterized the novel disease causativeness variant in GPR98 and broaden mutation spectrums , which could predict the pathogenic progression of patient with USH2C , guide diagnosis and treatment of this disease; and provide genetic counseling and family planning for consanguineous marriage pedigree in developing countries , including China.
