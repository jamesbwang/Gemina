  This study aims to determine if there is sex bias in basic and preclinical research on age-related hearing loss for the 10-year period of 2006-2015 , prior to the NIH mandate of including sex as a biological variable in 2016. Manuscripts were identified in PubMed for the query `` age-related hearing loss '' for the 10-year period of 2006 to 2015. Manuscripts were included if they were original research ( not reviews or meta-analyses) , written in English , contained an abstract , used animals , and were primarily on age-related hearing loss. These criteria yielded 231 unique manuscripts for inclusion in the study analysis. The text of each manuscript was screened for the sex of the animals , the number of male and female animals , the discussion of sex-based results , the study site ( US or international) , and the year of publication. Only two thirds of manuscripts reported the sex of animals used in the experiments , and of these , 54 % used both sexes , 34 % used males only , and 13 % used females only. In papers reporting sex and number of animals used , 67 % were males and 33 % were females. Over twice as many internationally based studies used males only compared to US-based studies. Only 15 % of all manuscripts discussed sex-based results. Sex bias is present in basic and preclinical age-related hearing loss research for the manuscripts screened in the 10-year period. Equal inclusion of both males and females in basic and preclinical age-related hearing loss research is critical for understanding sex-based differences in mechanisms and for effective treatment options.
