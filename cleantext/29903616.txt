  Sensory neurons of the vagus nerve receive many different peripheral signals that can change rapidly and frequently throughout the day. The ability of these neurons to convey the vast array of nuanced information to the brain requires neuronal adaptability. In this review we discuss evidence for neural plasticity in vagal afferent neurons as a mechanism for conveying nuanced information to the brain important for the control of feeding behavior. We provide evidence that synaptic plasticity , changes in membrane conductance , and neuropeptide specification are mechanisms that allow flexibility in response to metabolic cues that can be disrupted by chronic intake of energy dense diets.
