  The lateral-line neuromast of the zebrafish displays a restricted , consistent pattern of innervation that facilitates the comparison of microcircuits across individuals , developmental stages , and genotypes. We used serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to determine from multiple specimens the neuromast connectome , a comprehensive set of connections between hair cells and afferent and efferent nerve fibers. This analysis delineated a complex but consistent wiring pattern with three striking characteristics: each nerve terminal is highly specific in receiving innervation from hair cells of a single directional sensitivity; the innervation is redundant; and the terminals manifest a hierarchy of dominance.
