  Adult newts can regenerate large parts of their brain from adult neural stem cells ( NSCs) , but how adult NSCs reorganize brain structures during regeneration remains unclear. In development , elaborate brain structures are produced under broadly coordinated regulations of embryonic NSCs in the neural tube , whereas brain regeneration entails exquisite control of the re-establishment of certain brain parts , suggesting that a yet-unknown mechanism directs NSCs upon partial brain excision. Here we report that upon excision of a quarter of the adult newt (
