  Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of corn and sorghum with different processing methods on the expression of genes involved in volatile fatty acids transport and pH regulation , and ruminal keratinization in rumen epithelium of finishing bulls. For Exp. 1 , five rumen cannulated Nellore bulls were used in a 5x5 Latin square arrangement , with 14 d for adaptation and 9 d for sample collection. Treatments were: dry ground corn , dry ground sorghum , reconstituted corn , reconstituted sorghum , and control ( forage-based diet). Samples of rumen epithelium from ventral sac were excised , rinsed , snap-frozen and stored at -80 Â°C until total RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. In the Exp. 2 , 24 Nellore bulls were assigned to a completely randomized design lasting 168 d. Experimental treatments were similar to those at Exp. 1 , but without the control treatment. After the experimental period , bulls were slaughtered and rumen epithelium samples were rapidly excised for further histological analysis. Rumen epithelial tissue from animals fed reconstituted corn had lower expression of downregulated-in-adenoma ( P = 0.03) and Na +/ H + exchanger 2 ( trend; P = 0.09). The expression of Na +/ H + exchanger 1 ( P = 0.10) and putative anion transporter ( P = 0.06) tended to be lower in rumen epithelium of bulls fed reconstituted grains. Ruminal concentration of valerate was greater for animals fed reconstituted grain ( P = 0.01). Likewise , animals fed reconstituted corn tended to have greater butyrate ruminal concentration ( P = 0.08). Keratinized layer thickness did not differ among treatments ( P > 0.10). Therefore , reconstituted grains ( especially corn) decrease the mRNA expression of genes involved in volatile fatty acids transport and pH control in the rumen epithelium.
