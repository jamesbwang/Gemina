  This case report presents the technique of deep infiltration for the treatment of hypomineralized enamel lesions<symptom> in a patient affected by molar incisor hypomineralization ( MIH) with the purpose of obtaining an aesthetic improvement in the affected vestibular enamel. Deep infiltration treatment involves a sequence of steps starting with an initial mechanical abrasion of the outside surface of the enamel , followed by a phase of chemical erosion using 15 % hydrochloric acid , penetration through the porosity of the enamel by a very fluid resin , and finally the repair of the thin layer of lost enamel using a composite. The aesthetic improvement of the elements affected by hypomineralized lesions<symptom> is discernible immediately following treatment and becomes more accentuated with time. At the expense of minimal damage to surface enamel , deep infiltration enables treatment of all types of white spot enamel lesions<symptom> , regardless of aetiology , offering the possibility of restoring an aesthetically pleasing smile for patients.
