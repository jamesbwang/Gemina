  Over 100 years ago , Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites were defined as a pathologic hallmark of Parkinson disease. Eighty years later , α-synuclein was found to be the primary component of these inclusions<disease>. Emerging evidence suggests that α-synuclein pathology propagates across interconnected networks throughout the nervous system in a prion-like manner. Pathologic α-synuclein seeds aggregation of native α-synuclein , resulting in the formation of insoluble inclusions<disease>. These seeds can propagate within the neuron and to interconnected neurons , resulting in the spread of pathology throughout the brain. Here , we discuss how the findings that α-synuclein pathology spreads throughout the nervous system has revolutionized our understanding about Parkinson disease pathogenesis and resulted in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to halt disease progression.
