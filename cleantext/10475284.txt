  ABO-incompatible living-donor kidney transplantation ( LDKT) requires immunotherapy and plasma exchange therapy ( PEX). PEX with albumin replacement fluid reportedly decreases fibrinogen levels. However , no reports have described the effects of PEX with albumin replacement fluid on blood coagulation parameters and blood<symptom> loss<symptom> during the perioperative period. Therefore , we investigated the effects of preoperative PEX on blood coagulation parameters and blood<symptom> loss<symptom> during the perioperative period in patients undergoing ABO-incompatible LDKT as measured by rotational thromboelastometry ( ROTEM ®). Twenty-eight patients undergoing LDKT were divided into the PEX group ( ABO incompatible with PEX , n = 13) and non-PEX group ( ABO compatible without PEX , n = 15). ROTEM ® parameters , standard laboratory test parameters , bleeding volume , and transfusion volume were compared between PEX and non-PEX group. MCE The bleeding volume during surgery and the intensive care unit ( ICU) stay was significantly higher in the PEX than non-PEX group ( p < 0.01). Maximum clot firmness ( MCF) of EXTEM ( MCF These results suggest that the increased blood<symptom> loss<symptom> in the PEX group during surgery and the ICU stay was associated with decreased platelet contribution to clot strength as measured by ROTEM ®.
