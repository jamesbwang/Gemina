  For modern plate steels exhibiting high toughness and ductility , the conventional Charpy test is ostensibly stretched beyond its limits of applicability. Impact tests yield absorbed energy values in excess of 300-400 J , which are associated with limited material fracture and mostly derive from plastic deformation of the specimen ( bending) , friction , and vibrations of the swinging hammer. It would be therefore very desirable to measure the actual fracture toughness of very-high-toughness steels by means of an alternative specimen and/or methodology , entailing just a moderate increase of cost and test complexity with respect to Charpy testing. The investigation presented here was aimed at establishing a reasonable , yet cost-effective test procedure utilizing Charpy-type specimens for measuring the dynamic toughness of high-toughness steels , such as line pipe steels. Promising results have been obtained from notches cut by electrical-discharge machining ( EDM) using a thin wire of 0.1 mm diameter , as compared to specimens where an actual crack was generated and propagated by fatigue<symptom> at the root of the machined notch.
