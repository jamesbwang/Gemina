  An estimate of fetal fraction ( FF) is needed for DNA-based screening for trisomy 21 and other aneuploidies , but there is no gold standard to validate FF measurement methods. We specify a gold standard and use it to validate 1 method of measuring FF ( SeqFF). The gold standard was a formula derived from 2 elements: ( The gold standard formula was P The proposed gold standard can be used to validate different methods of estimating FF in singleton pregnancies. SeqFF is an accurate method of estimating FF.
