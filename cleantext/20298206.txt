  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motoneuron death. Several cellular pathways have been described to be involved in ALS pathogenesis; however , the involvement of presynaptic stripping and the related MHC class I molecules in mutant SOD1 motoneurons remains to be clarified. To this purpose , we here investigated , for the first time , the motoneurons behavior , di per seand after facial axonal injury , in terms of synaptic stripping and MHC class I expression in wild-type ( Wt) mice and in a murine model of ALS , the SOD1 ( G93A) mice , at the presymptomatic and symptomatic stage of the disease. Concerning Wt animals , we found a reduction in synaptophysin immunoreactivity and an increase of MHC class I molecules in facial motoneurons after axotomy. In uninjured motoneurons of SOD1 ( G93A) mice , an altered presynaptic framework was evident , and this phenomenon increased during the disease course. The alteration in the presynaptic input is related to excitatory fibers. Moreover , after injury , a further decrease of excitatory input was not associated to an upregulation of MHC class I molecules in motoneuron soma. This study demonstrates , for the first time , that the presence of mutated SOD1 protein affects the MHC class I molecules expression , altering the presynaptic input in motoneurons. Nevertheless , a positive MHC class I immunolabeling was evident in glial cells around facial injured motoneurons , underlying an involvement of these cells in synaptic stripping. This study contributes to better understand the involvement of the mutated SOD1 protein in the vulnerability of motoneurons after damage.
