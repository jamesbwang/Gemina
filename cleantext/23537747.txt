  Targeted cancer therapy with natural compounds is more effective than nontargeted therapy. Nobiletin is a flavonoid derived from citrus peel that has anticancer activity. Cluster of differentiation 36 ( CD36) is a member of the class B scavenger receptor family that is involved in importing fatty acids into cells. CD36 plays a role in tumor angiogenesis by binding to its ligand , thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1) , and then interacting with transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGFβ1). CD36 is implicated in tumor metastasis through its roles in fatty acid metabolism. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying nobiletin 's anticancer activity by characterizing its interactions with CD36 as the target molecule. We hypothesize that the anti-angiogenic activity of nobiletin involving its regulation of CD36 via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) rather than through TSP-1. Gene analysis identified a Gamma interferon activation site ( GAS) element in the CD36 gene promoter that acts as a STAT3 binding site , an interaction that was confirmed by ChIP assay. STAT3 interacts with nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ( NF-κB) , suggesting that nobiletin also acts through the CD36/ ( STAT3)/ NF-κB signaling axis. Nobiletin inhibited CD36-dependent breast cancer cell migration and invasion as well as CD36-mediated tumor sphere formation. Taken together , these results suggest that nobiletin inhibits cancer stem cells in multiple ways.
