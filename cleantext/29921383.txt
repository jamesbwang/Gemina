  This study aims to evaluate the effect of sildenafil on pulmonary hypertension ( PH) associated with chronic left heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Twenty patients with PH and left heart<symptom> failure<symptom> were divided into treatment group ( 10 cases , with an oral dose of sildenafil 75 mg daily for 8 weeks) and control group ( 10 cases , with treatment of cardiac glycosides , diuretics , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin II receptor blocker and beta-blockers). Left ventricular systolic function ( LVEF) , the pulmonary artery systolic pressure ( PH) , the left ventricular fraction shortening ( LVFS) , the left atrium diameter ( LAD) and the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ( LVD) were measured by echocardiography , the left ventricular mass index ( LVMI) was also calculated. The level of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) was detected by electrochemiluminescence and high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP) by immune transmission. The walking distance in 6-minute walk test ( 6-MWT) was calculated. Before treatment , there were no significant differences in LVEF , LVFS , NT-- proBNP , hsCRP , 6-MWT , LVD , LAD and LVMI between the treatment group and control group. After four weeks intervention in the treatment group , LVEF , FS and 6-MWT were significantly increased , while NT-- proBNP , hsCRP , 6-MWT , LVD and LVMI were significantly decreased , when compared with the control group. In conclusion , sildenafil can improve cardiac function and reduce pulmonary artery pressure. In addition , it can attenuate myocardial remodeling through its anti-inflammatory effect.
