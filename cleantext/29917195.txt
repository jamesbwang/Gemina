  To explore the effects of microRNA-1266 ( miR-1266) on metastasis and growth in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells and to provide therapeutic targets for papillary thyroid carcinoma. By quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) , miR-1266 expression level in 38 pairs of papillary thyroid carcinoma tissues and three breast cancer-derived cell lines was examined. After transfection with miR-1266 mimics , the effects of miR-1266 over-expression on cell proliferation , invasion and migration were analyzed. Further , we employed several databases for the target gene prediction. Dual-luciferase activity assay was performed to verify whether FGFR2 was the direct target gene of miR-1266. Western blotting was conducted to detect protein levels. MiR-1266 was significantly downregulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma tissue samples and cell lines. Over-expression of miR-1266 in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells significantly attenuated the cell proliferation , invasion , and migration. Dual-luciferase report assay and Western blotting confirmed that FGFR2 was a target gene of miR-1266. Furthermore , up-regulation of FGFR2 partially reversed the suppressive effects of miR-1266 over-expression on cell growth and progression. miR-1266 could inhibit cell proliferation and progression of papillary thyroid carcinoma via targeting FGFR2. Our findings might provide a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
