  This study aims to investigate relationship between the level of uric acid ( UA) and UA/creatinine ratios ( UA/Cr) to the stage of Parkinson disease ( PD). A total of 120 cases of PD patients who were admitted in our hospital between 2013 and 2015 were enrolled into this study; these 120 cases of PD patients were divided into 3 groups , according to Hoehn-Yahr ( H-Y) classification: early stage ( 1-2 classification) , medium stage ( 2.5-3 classification) , and advanced stage ( 4-5 classification); UA and UA/Cr level in each group was compared. Then , factors including age , gender , dopamine dosage , UA , and UA/Cr levels were analyzed to find the independent predictive factors of PD by logistic regression.UA and UA/Cr levels in the early and medium stage PD patients were significantly higher than in the advanced stage ones. UA and UA/Cr levels in patients with good prognosis were significantly higher than in the poor ones.UA and UA/Cr levels are negatively correlated with the stages of PD and are independent negatively predicting biological indexes of PD incidence and progression.
