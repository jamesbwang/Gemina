  To compare current practice in the management of female pelvic organ prolapse in Australia and New Zealand with that in 2007 , and assess the impact on practice of the withdrawal of Prolift ® and Prosima ® mesh kits in 2015. In early 2015 , two invitations to participate in a survey , including a link to Surveymonkey , were emailed to 2506 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RANZCOG) trainees and fellows. The online survey closely resembled a printed survey that was posted to RANZCOG trainees and fellows in 2007 and had additional questions relating to the impact of withdrawal of Prolift ® and Prosima ® products. Four-hundred-and-three doctors participated , giving a response rate of 16 %. Native tissue repair was the procedure of choice for primary and recurrent prolapse of the anterior and posterior vaginal wall. An implant was used to treat 45 % of anterior recurrences and 25 % of posterior recurrences. Vaginal hysterectomy and repair were the procedures of choice for uterovaginal prolapse. Sacrospinous hysteropexy was the uterine preservation procedure of choice , preferred by 41 %. For post-hysterectomy vault prolapse , sacrospinous colpopexy and vaginal repair was preferred by 65 % of respondents. Between 2007 and 2015 , there was a substantial decrease in respondents ' usage of implants across all indications except for midurethral slings and sacrocolpo/hysteropexy. Forty-two percent of respondents changed their practice as a result of Prolift ® and Prosima ® being withdrawn. There is a trend toward increasing use of various native tissue prolapse repair procedures and midurethral slings , and less utilisation of transvaginal mesh for prolapse.
