  Construction of an artificial protein needle ( PN) , which includes the membrane puncturing needle domain of bacteriophage T4 conjugated to Mn carbonyl ( MnCO) complexes , is reported. The responsiveness to visible light of the MnCO complex makes it useful as a photoinduced in vivo magnetic resonance imaging contrast reagent ( MRI CR) , because the PN carrier has the potential to deliver the MnCO complex into mouse tumors with retention of coordination structure within the in vivo environment. Moreover , the composite has higher relaxivity and longer circulation as an MRI CR than the corresponding MnCO complex. These results demonstrate construction of a responsive in vivo MRI CR by using an artificial metalloprotein.
