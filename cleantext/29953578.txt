  Information gap in drug labelingamong countries create challenges in therapeutic use of drugs.We aimed to evaluate the consistency ofdrug interaction information in drug labels among five countries. The studydrugs were chosen fromthe commonly approved drug list inthe United States , United Kingdom , China , Japan , and Korea. The degree of agreement of drug interaction data wasevaluated by kappa coefficient.Thirty-eight drugs wereevaluated , and moderate degree of agreement was observed among all countries ' labeling ( κ = 0.43 , 95 % CI: 0.41-0.46). The degree ofagreement was the highest for the UK and Korea ( κ = 0.71 , 95 % CI: 0.67-0.75) and the lowest forthe UK and Japan ( κ = 0.02 , 95 % CI: 0.00-0.04). Information regarding drug interactionslisted in the studied drug labels was not in high agreement. International standardization of drug labeling is requiredto ensure safe drug therapy.
