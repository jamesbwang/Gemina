  This study evaluated use of midazolam , ketamine , and xylazine ( MKX) for total intravenous ( IV) anesthesia ( TIVA) in horses. Medical records of 46 horses undergoing a clinical procedure using MKX for TIVA were reviewed. Age , breed , procedure , heart rate ( HR) , respiratory rate ( RR) , pre-anesthetic drugs , induction drugs , and total volume of MKX were recorded. Duration of anesthesia , time to standing , number of attempts to stand , and recovery score were also recorded. All horses were premedicated with an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist and anesthesia was induced with ketamine and midazolam. Duration of MKX infusion was 33 ± 14 min. Heart rate and RR decreased during the infusion of MKX. Time to endotracheal extubation was 19 ± 12 min. Horses stood at 33 ± 13 min. Median number of attempts to stand was 1. Maintenance of anesthesia of horses with MKX was useful for a variety of procedures and recovery from anesthesia was good.
