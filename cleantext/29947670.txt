  The genera Hemigrammus and Moenkhausia have been traditionally diagnosed mainly by the former having lateral line completely pored whereas the latter having a lateral line with a few pored scales. Those features have been used to diagnose species of both genera in the upper Paraná River floodplain. Specimens with the diagnostic features of Moenkhausia bonita , collected in the upper Paraná River floodplain , exhibited different developmental levels of the lateral line , making it difficult to distinguish them from specimens of Hemigrammus sp.. We analyzed the gene encoding cytochrome C oxidase I ( COI) and intron 1 of the nuclear gene S7 to investigate the genetic similarities between the called Hemigrammus marginatus<pathogen> and M. bonita and to confirm their identities. Molecular sequences of other Moenkhausia species were analyzed for genus delimitation tests. The results reveal genetic similarities of M. bonita specimens with different developmental levels of the lateral line , and also distinguish between M. bonita and Hemigrammus sp.. Species delimitation tests revealed that specimens from the upper Paraná River floodplain were M. bonita and were distinct from other Moenkhausia species. The developmental level of the lateral line is not a consistent characteristic that distinguishes between Moenkhausia and Hemigrammus species.
