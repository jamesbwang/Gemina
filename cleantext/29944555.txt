  Autogenous bone represents the best material in pediatric reconstructive cranioplasty because of its compatibility with growth; however , its availability is limited. Alternative use of alloplastic materials would have the advantage of unlimited amount , but shows an increased risk of complications and incompatibility with growth. Fresh frozen banked cadaveric bones could be ideal for the reconstruction of large cranial defects in growing patients , because it offers unlimited amount of structural grafts with biomechanics properties quite similar to the autologous bones. The authors report 2 cases of growing patients ( 13 months female and 9 years old male) undergoing the reconstruction of large ( about 70 cm and 50 cm respectively) cranial vault defects , by using structural homologous banked bone grafts.Analytic main reconstruction materials risks/benefits evaluation , literature review of few previously reported pediatric cranioplasty with homologous bone , and both clinical cases satisfactory radiologic long-term results ( beyond 4 years of F.U.) are reported. Structural homologous banked bone grafts appear as a valid solution for pediatric canioplasty reconstruction of wide defects , entailing the advantages of available without limitations and compatibility with future growth. The risk of transmissible infections seems minimal and is totally counterbalanced by the stability of long-term results.
