  This scoping review examined research on transitions among emerging adults , 18- to 30-year-olds , to identify designs , populations , frameworks , transition types , and transition outcomes. A librarian conducted the search , yielding 2067 articles. Using predefined criteria , teams screened abstracts and reviewed articles , with 82 % to 100 % interrater agreement. Data from the final 160 articles were placed in evidence tables and summarized. Most frequently , the studies had exploratory-descriptive designs ( 69 %) , nondiagnosed samples ( 58 %) , no theoretical frameworks ( 58 %) , developmental transitions ( 34 %) , and health-related behavior outcomes ( 34 %). This transition research is in an early stage of knowledge development and would benefit from further theory development.
