  Effective drugs and strategies for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus ( 2‑DM) are urgently required. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism underlying microRNA ( miR) 6835‑3p regulation of adiponectin receptor 1 ( AdipoR1) expression and the miR‑6835‑3p/ AdipoR1 signaling pathway in pancreatic islet cells. In addition , the potential anti‑diabetes effect of miR‑6835‑3p on insulin secretion was investigated. Luciferase activity analysis was performed to evaluate how miR‑6835‑3p targets the 3 ' untranslated region of AdipoR1. The SU .86.86 and MIN‑6 cell lines were co‑cultured with or without miR‑6835‑3p inhibitors or mimics , and the insulin secretory functions of these cell lines were then determined. Luciferase reporter analysis revealed that AdipoR1 was a direct target of miR‑6835‑3p. In addition , miR‑6835‑3p overexpression suppressed the mRNA and protein expression levels of AdipoR1 in the SU .86.86 and MIN‑6 cell lines. Furthermore , miR‑6835‑3p exerted negative effects on insulin secretion in SU .86.86 and MIN‑6 cells , which were mediated by regulating AdipoR1 expression. AdipoR1 was a direct target of miR‑6835‑3p; therefore , inhibition of AdiopR1 expression may reduce insulin secretion and may be considered a key regulator of insulin secretion. The results of the present study suggested that targeting AdipoR1 with miR‑6835‑3p inhibitors may be a potential strategy for promoting glucose‑stimulated insulin secretion , and thereby , may be an effective treatment for type 2‑DM.
