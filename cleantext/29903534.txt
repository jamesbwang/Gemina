  High-throughput sequencing can be used to measure changes in tumor composition across space and time. Specifically , comparisons of pre- and post-treatment samples can reveal the underlying clonal dynamics and resistance mechanisms. Here , we discuss evidence for distinct modes of tumor evolution and their implications for therapeutic strategies. In addition , we consider the utility of spatial tissue sampling schemes , single-cell analysis , and circulating tumor DNA to track tumor evolution and the emergence of resistance , as well as approaches that seek to forestall resistance by targeting tumor evolution. Ultimately , characterization of the ( epi) genomic , transcriptomic , and phenotypic changes that occur during tumor progression coupled with computational and mathematical modeling of tumor evolutionary dynamics may inform personalized treatment strategies.
