  To present a case of lingual thyroid Hürthle cell carcinoma. A 37-year old female presented with dysphagia<symptom> and recurrent haemorrhage. Histopathology was suggestive of Hürthle cell carcinoma; the tumour was excised by the transglossal approach which provided adequate exposure and helped avoid external scar or mandibular osteoetomy. Histopathology showed tumour-positive right lateral resection margin. This prompted referral to nuclear medicine for radioablation. Lingual thyroid cases should be followed up closely and fine needle aspiration biopsy should be considered when in doubt.
