  Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation is common in end-stage heart disease and is associated with an impaired survival after left ventricular assist device ( LVAD) surgery. Controversy remains whether concomitant tricuspid valve surgery ( TVS) during LVAD implantation is beneficial. We aimed to provide a contemporary overview of outcomes in patients who underwent LVAD surgery with or without concomitant TVS. A systematic literature search was performed for articles published between January 2005 and March 2017. Studies comparing patients undergoing isolated LVAD implantation and LVAD + TVS were included. Early outcomes were pooled in risk ratios using random effects models , and late survival was visualized by a pooled Kaplan-Meier curve. Eight publications were included in the meta-analysis , including 562 undergoing isolated LVAD implantation and 303 patients with LVAD + TVS. Patients undergoing LVAD + TVS had a higher tricuspid regurgitation grade , central venous pressure and bilirubin levels at baseline and were more often female. We found no significant differences in early mortality and late mortality , early right ventricular failure and late right ventricular failure , acute kidney failure , early right ventricular assist device implantation or length of hospital stay. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was longer in patients undergoing additional TVS ( mean difference +35 min 95 % confidence interval ( 16-55) , P = 0.001). Adding TVS during LVAD implantation is not associated with worse outcome. Adding TVS , nevertheless , may be beneficial , as baseline characteristics of patients undergoing LVAD + TVS were suggestive of a more progressive underlying disease , but with comparable short-term outcome and long-term outcome with patients undergoing isolated LVAD.
