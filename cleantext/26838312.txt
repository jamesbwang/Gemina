  Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. As the most widely studied and commonly applied natriuretic peptide ( NP) , B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP) has the effects of diuresis , natriuresis , vasodilation , anti-hypertrophy , and anti-fibrosis and it inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems to maintain cardiorenal homeostasis and counteract the effects of HF. Both BNP and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) are applied as diagnostic , managing , and prognostic tools for HF. However , due to the complexity of BNP system , the diversity of BNP forms and the heterogeneity of HF status , there are biochemical , analytical , and clinical issues on BNP not fully understood. Current immunoassays cross-react to varying degrees with pro B-type natriuretic peptide ( proBNP) , NT-proBNP and various BNP forms and can not effectively differentiate between these forms. Moreover , current immunoassays have different results and may not accurately reflect cardiac function. It is essential to design assays that can recognize specific forms of BNP , NT-proBNP , and proBNP to obtain more clinical information. Not only the processing of proBNP ( corin/furin) and BNP ( neprilysin) , but also the effects of glycosylation on proBNP processing and BNP assays , should be targeted in future studies to enhance their diagnostic , therapeutic , and prognostic values.
