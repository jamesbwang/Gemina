  To highlight current and established concepts regarding PCL injury and reconstruction. Recent biomechanical and clinical studies have brought attention to improved surgical techniques and clinical outcomes of PCL reconstruction. In contrast to anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) injuries , isolated posterior cruciate ligament ( PCL) injuries occur much less frequently and have traditionally been treated non-operatively. Even when a PCL injury meets operative indications , outcomes of PCL reconstruction historically do not match the success rates of ACL reconstruction procedures. As such , there remains controversy regarding appropriate indications and techniques for surgical repair leading to a paucity of conclusive data regarding surgical outcomes. Recently , however , there has been an increase in focus on the role of the PCL in proper knee biomechanics and negative long-term sequelae of chronic PCL insufficiency. This improved understanding has led to advancements in surgical technique and graft options for PCL reconstruction.
