  Interdigitating dendritic cell tumor/sarcoma ( IDCT) is a very rare and aggressive neoplasm arising from antigen-presenting cells. It usually involves lymph nodes , but extranodal sites can also be involved. Because of the rarity of the disease , consistent standard treatment guidelines have not been established till date. We report a case of a 35-year-old female who presented with right-sided neck swelling and anterior mediastinal mass. Histopathology revealed large mononucleated cells with background of mixed polymorphous inflammatory cells suspicious of Hodgkin 's lymphoma. Hence , to confirm the diagnosis , immunohistochemistry was done. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor was CD30- negative , CD10- negative , CD2- negative , leukocyte common antigen- positive , vimentin- positive , and S-100- positive , diagnostic of IDCT. Patient was treated with eight cycles of cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisolone regimen chemotherapy followed by involved field radiotherapy and showed dramatic response with complete resolution of mediastinal mass.
