  Synthetic polymer membranes<symptom> , critical to diverse energy-efficient separations , are subject to permeability-selectivity trade-offs that decrease their overall efficacy. These trade-offs are due to structural variations ( e.g. , broad pore size distributions) in both nonporous membranes<symptom> used for Angstrom-scale separations and porous membranes<symptom> used for nano to micron-scale separations. Biological membranes<symptom> utilize well-defined Angstrom-scale pores to provide exceptional transport properties and can be used as inspiration to overcome this trade-off. Here , we present a comprehensive demonstration of such a bioinspired approach based on pillar ( 5) arene artificial water channels , resulting in artificial water channel-based block copolymer membranes<symptom>. These membranes<symptom> have a sharp selectivity profile with a molecular weight cutoff of ~ 500 Da , a size range challenging to achieve with current membranes<symptom> , while achieving a large improvement in permeability ( ~ 65 L m
