  Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors where hypoxia-inducible factor plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. It has been suggested that patients with congenital heart disease , in particular , may have cellular environment and relative hypoxia favorable to the development of these neuroendocrine tumors. Here , we present a case of an 11-year-old child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome<disease> previously palliated with Fontan procedure , diagnosed with paraganglioma on surveillance imaging. We present the clinical course , intervention , and outcome as well as review the possible contributory mechanisms. As we continue to improve long-term survival for single ventricle patients , awareness of these tumors during surveillance may be warranted as timely intervention may lead to cure.
