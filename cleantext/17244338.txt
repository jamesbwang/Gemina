  Nucleolar organizer regions ( NORs) are chromosomal segments which are selectively stained by silver methods and evaluated as agyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions ( AgNORs). The evaluation of AgNORs provides an insight into the level of cellular proliferation. This technique has extensively and sparsely been used in human and veterinary histopathology respectively. However , two major drawbacks have been irreproducible results and excessive staining precipitates. This study seeks to adapt the technique to canine peripheral blood smears in order to establish a routine staining protocol. Standardized volumes and concentrations of silver nitrate , gelatin , and formic acid were applied to smears at different temperatures for varying lengths of time. The technique was applied to unfixed and fixed smears. In some cases , a reducing agent ( 1 % potassium iodide) was applied. It was shown that the optimum staining protocol was achieved by applying standardized solutions to a fixed smear at 46 Â°C for 50 minutes. It is concluded that the staining protocol outlined in this study is practicable , and produces excellent and reproducible results that would enhance evaluation of AgNORs in canine peripheral blood cells.
