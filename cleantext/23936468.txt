  Flavonoids are a group of metabolites in Ginkgo biloba thought to provide health benefits. R2R3-MYB transcription factors ( TFs) play key roles in the transcriptional regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis in plants. In this study , an R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene , GbMYBFL , was isolated from G. biloba and characterized. Results of bioinformatic analysis indicated that GbMYBFL is more closely related to the R2R3-MYB involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and displayed high similarity to MYB from other plants. The genmomic sequence of GbMYBFL had three exons and two introns , with its upstream sequence containing cis-acting regulatory elements Myb binding site , Myc recognition sites , and light , SA , MeJA responsive elements. Subcellular localization analysis indicates that GbMYBFL was located in the nucleus. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that GbMYBFL was expressed in leaves , stems , roots , young fruits , male flower and female flower , and the level of transcription in male flower and leaves were higher than that in female flower , stems , roots , and young fruits. During G. biloba leaf growth , the transcription of GbMYBFL is positively correlated with the flavonoid content , suggesting that the GbMYBFL is involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis. Overexpression of GbMYBFL under the control of the CaMV35S promoter in Ginkgo callus notably enhanced the accumulation of flavonoids and anthocyanin compared with non-transformed callus. This finding suggested that GbMYBFL positively related to flavonoid biosynthesis , and the overexpression of GbMYBFL was sufficient to induce flavonoids and anthocyanin accumulation.
