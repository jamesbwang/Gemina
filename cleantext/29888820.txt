  Zeolites , a class of crystalline microporous materials , have a wide range of practical applications , in particular serving as key catalysts in petrochemical and finechemical processes. Millions of zeolite topologies are theoretically possible. However , to date , only 235 frameworks with various tetrahedral element compositions have been discovered in nature or artificially synthesized , among which approximately 50 topologies are available in pure silica forms. Germanosilicates are becoming an important zeolite family , with a rapidly increasing number of topological structures with unusual double four-membered-ring ( D4R) building units and large-pore or extra large-pore systems. The synthesis of their high-silica analogues with higher ( hydro) thermal stability remains a great challenge because the formation of siliceous D4R units is kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable in hydrothermal systems. Herein , we demonstrate that such D4R-containing high-silica zeolites with unexpected crystalline topologies ( ECNU-24-RC and IM-20-RC) are readily constructed through a versatile route. This strategy provides new opportunities for the synthesis of high-silica zeolite catalysts that are hardly obtained by conventional hydrothermal synthesis and it would also facilitate a break-through in increasing the number and types of zeolite materials with practical applications.
