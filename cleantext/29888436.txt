  This account summarizes reactions of group 4 metallocene bis ( trimethylsilyl) acetylene complexes with nitriles and isonitriles. As examples several selected reactions of group 4 metallocene alkyne complexes of the type Cp ' 2M ( η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( M = Ti , Zr , Hf; Cp ' = Cp * = η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; M = Ti , Zr; Hf; Cp ' = Cp , Cp * and Cp ' 2 = rac- ( ebthi) = rac-1,2-ethylene-1,1 '- bis ( η5-tetrahydroindenyl) with different nitriles and isonitriles are described following the general L-M-S principle , in which stoichiometric and catalytic reactions are influenced by ligands L , metals M and substrate substituents S. The influence of all these parameters for L = Cp ' = Cp , Cp * , rac-ebthi; M = Ti , Zr , Hf and S in in R-C ≡ N with substituents R = Ph-CH2- , Ph2CH- , Ph- , 2-Me-C6H4- , Fc- , FcC4- , Me- , 1,3-C6H4- , 1,4-C6H4- , 2-py- , 4-py- , 2-Br-5-py- and others including- ( CH2) 4- , phenanthrene annulated as well as tetherated dinitriles is highlighted. The basic reactions with nitriles R-C ≡ N ( and in some cases with isonitriles in R-NC ( R = 2,5-Me2-C6H3NC) were investigated in detail and are summarized here. Selected further reactions of the obtained products with H2 , CO2 , HCl , SOCl2 and later in some cases with MeO2CC2CO2Me , RS2Cl2 , SeCl2 ( bipy) , TeCl2 ( bipy) , SnMe2Cl2 etc. , which again depend on L , M and S , are mentioned. Most interesting feature for this is the formation of mono- and polynuclear 1-metalla-2,5-diaza-cyclopenta-2,4-dienes , which show great potential for the synthesis of complex heterocycles.
