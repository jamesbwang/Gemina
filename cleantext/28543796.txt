  Hypoxia-mediated chemoresistance has been regarded as an important obstacle in the development of cancer treatment. Knockdown of krüppel-like factor 5 ( KLF5) was reported to inhibit hypoxia-induced cell survival and promote cell apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) cells via direct regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α) expression. However , the roles of KLF5 in the development of hypoxia-induced cisplatin ( DDP) resistance and its underlying mechanism in NSCLC cells remain to be further elucidated. Western blot was performed to determine the protein levels of KLF5 , P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) and HIF-1α in treated NSCLC cells. Cell survival was examined by MTT assay. The effect of KLF5 knockdown on hypoxia-induced glycolysis was assessed by measuring glucose consumption and lactate production. The effect of KLF5 knockdown on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K)/ protein kinase B ( Akt)/ mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR) pathway was analyzed by western blot. Hypoxia upregulated the expression of KLF5 in NSCLC cells. KLF5 knockdown suppressed hypoxia-induced DDP resistance in NSCLC cells , as demonstrated by the increased cytotoxic effects of DDP and reduced P-gp expression in NSCLC cells in hypoxia. Moreover , KLF5 knockdown inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression and glycolysis , and KLF5 knockdown suppressed hypoxia-induced DDP resistance by inhibiting HIF-1α-dependent glycolysis in NSCLC cells. Furthermore , KLF5 knockdown suppressed hypoxia-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in NSCLC cells and KLF5 overexpression promoted hypoxia-induced DDP resistance in NSCLC cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. KLF5 knockdown could suppress hypoxia-induced DDP resistance , and its mechanism may be due to the inhibition of HIF-1α-dependent glycolysis via inactivation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
