  Immediate supply of red blood cell ( RBC) concentrates is crucial in the initial treatment of exsanguinating patients in the emergency room. General shortage of RhD- RBCs has led to protocols in which patients with unknown blood groups are initially transfused with group O , RhD + RBCs. Limited data are available regarding the safety of such an approach. Transfusion protocols for all multiple injured patients from the regional polytrauma database were retrospectively analyzed over a period of 5 years. Data on side effects were retrieved from the local safety update registry. Follow-up data were obtained from patients with identified RhD-incompatible transfusions. In total , 823 patients were registered as multiple injured in the database. An immediate transfusion of 259 units ( mean number of units 4 , range 1-6) group O , RhD + RBCs was initiated in 62 of them. 14 of these patients were RhD- and received 60 units of RhD-incompatible RBCs in the emergency room. In the later course RhD- patients received additional 185 incompatible transfusions ( 13; 1-31). The overall seroconversion rate was 50 %. No adverse outcome due to incompatible transfusion was observed. Initial supply with group O , RhD + RBCs in multiple injured patients appears to be safe. Significant numbers of RhD- units can be saved for use in other patients.
