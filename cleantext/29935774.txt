  Nerve conduction studies ( NCS) , CTS-6 , Wainner , Kamath , and Lo are diagnostic tests that are used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome<disease> ( CTS). To our knowledge , no study has compared the sensitivity and specificity of these 5 tests with one another. The purpose of this study is to compare NCS , CTS-6 , Wainner , Kamath , and Lo using clinical diagnosis by a hand fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeon as reference standard. A hand fellowship-trained surgeon completed the CTS-6 , Wainner , Kamath , and Lo diagnostic tools. Cutoff values for a positive test were based on values in the literature , if available. The NCS were performed by a certified electrodiagnostic physician according the standards of the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine and were interpreted using absolute latencies , relative latencies , and combined sensory index. Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio were calculated for the tests using clinical diagnosis as the reference standard. A total of 408 wrists from 250 patients were analyzed in the study. The NCS had the highest sensitivity ( 94 %) but also the lowest specificity ( 50 %) of any of the diagnostic tests. Using a cutoff of 18 , CTS-6 had the highest specificity ( 99 %). The NCS had the highest area under the curve at 74 % , followed closely by the Kamath at 69 %. The NCS were traditionally felt to be a strong confirmatory test given their high specificity. However , this prospective series demonstrated that NCS had the lowest specificity of any diagnostic test. Consideration should be given to using alternative diagnostic tests/tools based on the results of this study.
