  To investigate the effect of human adipose-derived stem cells ( hADSCs) on pressure ulcers<disease> in mouse. The subcutaneous adipose tissue from voluntary donation was harvested. Then the hADSCs were isolated and cultured by mechanical isolation combined with typeâ… collagenase digestion. The 3rd generation cells were identified by osteogenic , adipogenic , chondrogenic differentiations and flow cytometry. The platelet rich plasma ( PRP) from peripheral blood donated by healthy volunteers was prepared by centrifugation. The pressure ulcer<disease> model was established in 45 C57BL/6 mice by two magnets pressurized the back skin , and randomly divided into 3 groups ( The cultured cells were identified as hADSCs by induced differentiation and flow cytometry. The platelet counting was significantly higher in PRP group than in normal peripheral blood group ( Local transplantation of hADSCs can accelerate healing of pressure ulcer<disease> wounds<disease> in mice and improve healing quality by promoting revascularization and nerve regeneration.
