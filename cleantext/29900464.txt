  The flow threshold in dense granular materials is typically modeled by local , stress-based criteria. However , grain-scale cooperativity leads to size effects that can not be captured with local conditions. In a widely studied example , flows of thin layers of grains down an inclined surface exhibit a size effect whereby thinner layers require more tilt to flow. In this paper , we consider the question of whether the size-dependence of the flow threshold observed in inclined plane flow is configurationally general. Specifically , we consider three different examples of inhomogeneous flow- planar shear flow with gravity , annular shear flow , and vertical chute flow- using two-dimensional discrete-element method calculations and show that the flow threshold is indeed size-dependent in these flow configurations , displaying additional strengthening as the system size is reduced. We then show that the nonlocal granular fluidity model- a nonlocal continuum model for dense granular flow- is capable of quantitatively capturing the observed size-dependent strengthening in all three flow configurations.
