  Arsenic is associated with several adverse health outcomes , and people with diabetes may be more susceptible to arsenic. In this study , we found that arsenic levels in some tissues such as liver , kidney , and heart but not lung of type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM) mice were higher than in those of normal mice after a single oral dose of arsenic trioxide for 2 h. However , little is known about the molecular mechanism of the increased tissue uptake of trivalent inorganic arsenic in mice with T1DM. This study aimed to investigate the expression of the mammalian arsenic transporters aquaglyceroporins ( AQPs) and glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT1) in T1DM mice and compare them with those in normal mice. Results showed that the levels of AQP9 and GLUT1 mRNA and protein were higher in T1DM mouse liver than in the normal one. The levels of AQP7 mRNA and protein were higher in T1DM mouse kidney. In the heart , we observed that the levels of AQP7 and GLUT1 mRNA and protein were higher in T1DM mice , but the levels of AQP9 mRNA and protein in the lung had no significant difference between both mice. These results suggested that T1DM may increase the expression of transporters of trivalent inorganic arsenic and thus increase the arsenic uptake in specific tissues.
