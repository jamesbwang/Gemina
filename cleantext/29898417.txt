  This study aimed to identify sensitive and not-invasive biomarkers of early genotoxic/oxidative effect for exposure to styrene in the fibreglass reinforced plastic manufacture. We studied 11 workers of a plastic manufacture using open molding process ( A) , 16 workers of a manufacture using closed process ( B) and 12 controls. We evaluated geno/cytotoxic effects on buccal cells by Buccal Micronucleus Cytome ( BMCyt) assay and genotoxic/oxidative effects on lymphocytes by Fpg-comet test. On A workers we also evaluated urinary 8oxoGua , 8oxodGuo and 8oxoGuo to investigate oxidative stress. Personal inhalation exposure to styrene was monitored by passive air sampling and GC/MS. Biological monitoring included urinary metabolites mandelic acid ( MA) and phenylglyoxylic acid ( PGA). The findings show higher styrene exposure , urinary MA + PGA levels and micronucleus frequency in manufacture A. Higher buccal karyolytic cell frequency vs controls were found in both exposed populations. We found in exposed workers , no induction of direct DNA damage but oxidative DNA damage. Fpg-comet assay and urinary oxidized guanine seem to be sensitive biomarkers of oxidative stress and BMCyt assay a good-not invasive biomarker of cyto-genotoxicity at target organ. The study , although limited by the small number of studied subjects , shows the usefulness of used biomarkers in risk assessment of styrene-exposed workers.
