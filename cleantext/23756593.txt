  The previous study showed that mycophenolic acid ( MPA) synergizing with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) promoted interleukin ( IL) -1 β release , but the mechanism is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of MPA synergizing with LPS to induce IL-1β release. Undiluted human blood cells , THP-1 human myeloid leukemia<disease> mononuclear cells ( THP-1) cells , or monocytes were stimulated with LPS and treated with or without MPA , and the supernatant IL-1β was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA levels of IL-1β were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The intracellular protein levels of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB) phospho-p65 ( p-p65) , precursor interleukin-1β ( pro-IL-1β) , NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing-3 ( NLRP3) , and cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease-1 ( caspase-1) p20 in THP-1 cell were measured by Western blot. The MPA alone failed to induce IL-1β , whereas MPA synergized with LPS to increase IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner ( 685.00 ± 20.00 pg/ml in LPS + 5 μmol/L MPA group , P = 0.035; 742.00 ± 31.58 pg/ml in LPS + 25 μmol/L MPA group , P = 0.017; 1000.00 ± 65.59 pg/ml in LPS + 75 μmol/L MPA group , P = 0.024; versus 408.00 ± 35.50 pg/ml in LPS group). MPA alone has no effect on the IL-1β mRNA expression , LPS induced the expression of IL-1β mRNA 2761 fold , and LPS + MPA increased the IL-1β expression 3018 fold , which had the same effect with LPS group ( P = 0.834). MPA did not affect the intracellular NF-κB p-p65 and pro-IL-1β protein levels but activated NLRP3 inflammasome. Ac-YVAD-cmk blocked the activation of caspase-1 and subsequently attenuated IL-1β secretion ( 181.00 ± 45.24 pg/ml in LPS + MPA + YVAD group vs. 588.00 ± 41.99 pg/ml in LPS + MPA group , P = 0.014). Taken together , MPA synergized with LPS to induce IL-1β release via the activation of caspase-1 , rather than the enhanced production of pro-IL-1β. These findings suggested that patients immunosuppressed with mycophenolate mofetil may have overly activated caspase-1 during infection , which might contribute to a more sensitive host defense response to invading germs.
