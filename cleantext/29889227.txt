  To establish aspirational ` gold standards ' for a suite of System-Level Measures ( SLMs) being used by Counties Manukau Health ( CM Health) , a New Zealand ( NZ -RRB- District Health Board. This study employed a multi-stage , multi-method modified Delphi consensus process. The Delphi consensus process involved virtual ( email) communication between participants ( Round 1) and a structured face-to-face meeting ( Round 2) held in Auckland , NZ. Participants comprised of health professionals , managers , academics and quality improvement experts with an interest in the use of SLMs. Participants in the first round received a letter requesting their participation in an anonymous Delphi. The second round involved national and international health system experts taking part in a structured , facilitated face-to-face meeting. Participants reviewed 15 SLMs in total. The SLMs all related to the three domains of the Triple Aim: Population Health , e.g. life expectancy at birth; Patient Experience of Care , e.g. rate of adverse events; and Cost and Productivity , e.g. healthcare expenditure per capita. For a proposed gold standard to be agreed and established for each SLM. Twelve participants took part in Round 1 , with 19 participating in Round 2. The process established agreement on a gold standard for each of the 15 reviewed SLMs. We demonstrated that the Delphi consensus process can be used to establish gold standards for a suite of SLMs used by a NZ Health Board ( CM Health).
