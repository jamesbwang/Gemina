  Thyroid dysfunction ( TD) was usually described in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) recipients who were given total body irradiation ( TBI) in the conditioning regimen. Because previous studies have reported discrepant results regarding the presence of long-term thyroid complications in HSCT survivors following chemotherapy-only conditioning , we investigated the frequency of thyroid abnormalities in a series of children treated with HSCT for different disorders without TBI as part of the conditioning protocol. We compared thyroid-stimulating hormone , free thyroxine , total triiodothyronine ( TT3) , anti-peroxidase ( TPO Ab) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and thyroid volume z-score in 28 HSCT survivors and 16 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. HSCT recipients had a higher frequency of TD and thyroid complications in total , including TD and euthyroid Hashimoto thyroiditis , compared to the control group. Patients transplanted for Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL) were more likely to develop a thyroid complication compared to patients with non-malignant hematologic diseases and leukemia<disease> patients. BEAM ( carmustine , etoposide , citarabin and melphalan) conditioning compared to busulfan ( Bu) and fludarabine ( Flu)- based regimens and autologous compared to allogenic grafting were associated with a higher prevalence of TD in our study. HSCT survivors had higher mean serum TT3 levels. A multivariate analysis revealed that autologous ( auto)- HSCT recipients had higher mean serum titers of TPO Ab compared to allogenic ( allo)- HSCT recipients and controls and the mean thyroid volume z-score was significantly higher in controls compared to auto-/ allo-HSCT survivors. We identified a 35.7 % prevalence of thyroid abnormalities , emphasizing the need for a long-term surveillance of thyroid function and morphology even in this group of patients who were not exposed to TBI.
