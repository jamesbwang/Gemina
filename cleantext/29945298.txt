  A major drawback in testate amoeba research is a general lack of scientific studies combining molecular approaches and classical laboratory experiments. We isolated five yet uncultured testate amoebae of the genus Phryganella Penard , 1902 from three different rivers and one pond in Germany. Based on established cultures we show their morphology , which we studied by light and electron microscopy , and present their unique feeding mode on abundant and common pennate diatoms like Nitzschia spp. and Synedra spp. , whose frustules are bent and frequently , but not always , broken during the feeding process. We further obtained the first SSU rDNA sequences of strains of the family Phryganellidae , all of which contain introns. We used the sequences to confirm the taxonomic placement of the Phryganellidae in the Arcellinida ( Amoebozoa) , branching as a sister group to the Cryptodifflugiidae.
