  Functional assessment of the right ventricle using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography ( RT3DE) has fundamental relevance in young patients with congenital heart disease. Reference values for the pediatric population are scarce. This multicenter study was designed to ( 1) validate new evaluation software for RT3DE and ( 2) establish pediatric reference values. For validation , right ventricular ( RV) end-diastolic volume ( EDV) and end-systolic volume ( ESV) were determined from real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic data sets of 38 subjects ( n = 17 healthy individuals and n = 21 patients with congenital heart disease) using new dedicated evaluation software ( RV-Function 2.0) and compared with cardiac magnetic resonance investigations of the same patient cohort. In a prospective multicenter design , 360 real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic data sets of healthy children ( 172 girls) were analyzed. To create reference centiles , the cohort was subdivided into group I ( children < 7 years of age , n = 136 ( female and male)) , group II ( girls 7-18 years of age , n = 106) , and group III ( boys 7-18 years of age , n = 118). Using RT3DE , RV volumes were slightly higher than using cardiac magnetic resonance ( EDV , 0.8 ± 5.8 % ( limits of agreement , -10.8 % to 12.5 %; r = 0.993); ESV , 2.0 ± 13.1 % ( limits of agreement , -24.2 % to 28.2 %; r = 0.989). Reproducibility was promising ( intraobserver variability , 3.9 ± 11.4 % for EDV and -1.7 ± 13.4 % for ESV ( intraclass correlation coefficient range , 0.94-0.98); interobserver variability , 1.9 ± 11.8 % for EDV and -0.3 ± 22.8 % for ESV ( intraclass correlation coefficient range , 0.85-0.96)). Regarding functional parameters , no significant gender differences were found among children in group I. In contrast , children in groups II and III differed in RV volumes , dimensional parameters , and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( P < .005); the children did not differ in deformation parameters. Feasibility was 90 %. RT3DE yields accurate and reproducible RV volumes. The calculated percentile curves may facilitate the clinical use of RT3DE to analyze RV function in children.
