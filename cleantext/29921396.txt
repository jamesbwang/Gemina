  The aim of this study was to compare the safety and the efficacy of two methods of continuous blood purification ( CBP) , continuous veno-venous hemofiltration ( CVVH) and high volume hemofiltration ( HVHF) , for treatment of infantile sepsis<disease>. Eighty-six children with sepsis<disease> were enrolled in this study and randomly divided into two groups with 47 cases in the CVVH group and 39 cases in the HVHF group. Survival rate , duration of blood filtration , mean arterial pressure ( MAP) , mean heart rate and SaO2 , APACHE II score , procalcitonin , hs-CRP and TXB2 were compared between the two groups. Results showed that survival rate , MAP , mean heart rate and SaO2 in the two groups did not have any significant differences. Duration of blood filtration and APACHE II score in the HVHF group was significantly shorter than that in the CVVH group. After therapy , levels of procalcitonin , hs-CRP and TXB2 declined dramatically in both groups , however this reduction was more significant in the HVHF group. We conclude that HVHF is a safer and more effective method as it produced stable hemodynamics , shorter filtration time , better APACHE II scores and better results in alleviating inflammatory reactions.
