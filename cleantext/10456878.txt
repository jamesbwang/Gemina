  Posner-Schlossman-Syndrome<pathogen> ( PSS<pathogen>) is clinically characterized by acute , recurrent , mild , unilateral uveitis<pathogen> anterior accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure<pathogen> ( IOP<pathogen>). Fuchs ' Uveitis<pathogen> ( FU<pathogen>) is a chronic , low-grade-inflammatory disorder<pathogen> , involving anterior uvea<pathogen> and vitreous. The clinical findings<pathogen> show remarkable similarities<pathogen> as well as differences<pathogen>. In our study<pathogen> , we determine the composition<pathogen> of immune mediators<pathogen> in aqueous humor<pathogen> of patients<pathogen> with PSS and FU<pathogen> and evaluate if immune mediators<pathogen> play a crucial role<pathogen> in specific viral intraocular inflammation<pathogen> and IOP<pathogen> rises<pathogen>. Aqueous humor<pathogen> samples<pathogen> from 81 uveitis<pathogen> patients<pathogen> ( = eyes<pathogen>) presenting with either PSS<pathogen> or FU<pathogen> were collected at one time<pathogen> point<pathogen>. Local intraocular antibody<pathogen> synthesis<pathogen> to rubella<pathogen> virus<pathogen> was confirmed in 65 patients<pathogen> , whereas 16 were tested positively for human cytomegalovirus<pathogen>. Thirteen patients<pathogen> with PSS and 10 patients<pathogen> with FU<pathogen> were treated with glaucoma<pathogen> medications<pathogen>. Additionally , 11 cataract<pathogen> patients<pathogen> acted as control group<pathogen>. Immune mediator<pathogen> concentrations<pathogen> were measured by Bio-Plex<pathogen> Pro<pathogen> assay<pathogen>. We observed in both PSS<pathogen> ( IFN-γ<pathogen>: 174.9 pg/mL<pathogen>; TNF-α<pathogen>: 25.1 pg/mL<pathogen>) and FU<pathogen> ( IFN-γ<pathogen>: 25.4 pg/mL<pathogen>; TNF-α<pathogen>: 27.2 pg/mL<pathogen>) groups<pathogen> a significantly increased level<pathogen> of T-helper<pathogen> 1 immune mediators<pathogen> compared to controls<pathogen> ( IFN-γ<pathogen> , TNF-α<pathogen>: 0 pg/mL<pathogen>) ( median<pathogen>). Notably , PSS patients<pathogen> ( IL-1RA<pathogen>: 73.4 pg/mL<pathogen>; IL-8<pathogen>: 199.4 pg/mL<pathogen>; IL-10<pathogen>: 33.4 pg/mL<pathogen>; IP-10<pathogen>: 126350 pg/mL<pathogen>) showed a stronger and more active ocular inflammatory response<pathogen> , than FU<pathogen> patients<pathogen> ( IL-1RA<pathogen>: 4.3 pg/mL<pathogen>; IL-8<pathogen>: 72.4 pg/mL<pathogen>; IL-10<pathogen>: 1.6 pg/mL<pathogen>; IP-10<pathogen>: 57400 pg/mL<pathogen>). Furthermore , a negative correlation<pathogen> between mediators<pathogen> and IOP<pathogen> was seen in the PSS group<pathogen> , potentially caused by acetazolamide-treatment<pathogen>. Our findings<pathogen> show that immune mediators<pathogen> play a crucial role<pathogen> in specific viral intraocular inflammation<pathogen> and influence<pathogen> IOP<pathogen> levels<pathogen>. Remarkable similarities<pathogen> but also significant differences<pathogen> of immune mediator<pathogen> concentrations<pathogen> are apparent in PSS compared to FU<pathogen>. High concentrations<pathogen> of IL-1RA<pathogen> , IL-8<pathogen> , IL-10<pathogen> , and IP-10<pathogen> correlate with active inflammation<pathogen> in PSS , while FU<pathogen> may trigger chronic inflammation<pathogen>. Our data<pathogen> also substantiated a very similar composition<pathogen> of cytokines<pathogen> in those patients<pathogen> from the PSS group<pathogen> suffering from ocular hypertension<pathogen> and thus offers a potential explanation<pathogen> model<pathogen> for a negative correlation<pathogen> between mediators<pathogen> and
