  This research analyzes the impact of quality of life as a metavariable that conditions the health and social welfare of the elderly. The sample of this study is composed of 500 people , randomly selected from the major day centers for the elderly in the province of Granada ( Spain). For the inferential analysis , we used the CUBRECAVI questionnaire , which is a multidimensional scale of health and quality of life , along with the Katz and Garc√≠a measure questionnaires , which are also applied to quality of life. Through the technique of the interview , we have distributed the participants into two groups: experimental and control. Once the tests have been completed , we have concluded from the meta-analysis and validation tests that the participants have a good perception of their quality of life , considering health , leisure , environmental quality , functional capacity , level of satisfaction , social support , social networks , and positive social interactions as the determinants of their well-being , although social contact reduces as the age advances. We conclude that multidimensional evaluation is an effective tool to evaluate the quality of life and the objective and subjective health of the elderly. These variables can be related to the improvement of health and well-being.
