  By focusing on the automatic visual change detection process , the present study attempted to clarify neural processing relevant to the exogenously driven perceptual alternation ( ePA) of a bistable image. In our recent electroencephalographic study , the oddball paradigm was adopted to the continuous presentation of a bistable image to record visual mismatch negativity ( vMMN , a relative enhancement in the brain response to a deviant over a repetitively presented standard , reflecting the visual change detection process and prediction error to the deviant over the standard). In terms of interindividual differences in behavioral and neural data , a correlation was reported previously between the enhancement of vMMN and facilitation of perceptual alternation , suggesting the involvement of the visual change detection process in ePA. However , the vMMN recorded was expected to be confounded by neural adaptation to the repetitively presented standard; thus , it currently remains unclear whether visual change detection not dependent on neural adaptation , reflected in a ` genuine vMMN ' , is relevant to ePA. To examine this issue , the present study used a new stimulation paradigm , based on the so-called equiprobable paradigm , to mitigate neural adaptation. The results showed that a genuine vMMN significantly emerged and correlated with an increase in the proportion of perceptual alternation across participants. This supports the involvement of the automatic visual change detection process , not dependent on neural adaptation , in facilitating perceptual alternation. The present results provide a deeper understanding of the involvement of the visual change detection process in ePA.
