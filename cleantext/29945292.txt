  Activation of the human pregnane X receptor ( PXR; NR1I2) has potential therapeutic uses for inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD). Imperatorin ( IMP) , a naturally occurring coumarin , is the main bioactive ingredient of Angelica dahurica Radix , which is regularly used to treat the common cold and intestinal disorders. However , there are no data on the protective effects of IMP against IBD. The effects of IMP on PXR-modulated cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4) expression were assessed using a PXR transactivation assay , a mammalian two-hybrid assay , a competitive ligand-binding assay , analysis of CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression levels and measurement of CYP3A4 activity using a cell-based reporter gene assay and in vitro model. The inhibitory effects of IMP on NF-κB activity were evaluated by a reporter assay and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. The anti-IBD effects of IMP were investigated in a dextran sulphate sodium ( DSS)- induced colitis<disease> mouse model. Colon inflammatory cytokines were assessed by elisa. IMP activated CYP3A4 promoter activity , recruited steroid receptor coactivator 1 to the ligand-binding domain of PXR and increased the expression and activity of CYP3A4. PXR knockdown substantially reduced IMP-induced increase in CYP3A4 expression. Furthermore , IMP-mediated PXR activation suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and down-regulated LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Nevertheless , PXR knockdown partially reduced the IMP-mediated inhibition of NF-κB. IMP ameliorated DSS-induced colitis<disease> by PXR/NF-κB signalling. IMP acts as a PXR agonist to attenuate DSS-induced colitis<disease> by suppression of the NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory response in a PXR/NF-κB-dependent manner.
