  Statins have been associated with later life , long-term care admission in observational studies. However , by preventing vascular events , statins may also prevent or delay admission. We wished to determine statin and long-term care admission associations in a randomised controlled trial context , and describe associations between long-term care admission and other clinical and demographic factors. We used extended follow-up of two randomised trial populations , using national data to assign the long-term care admission outcome , and included individuals screened or recruited to two large randomised trials of pravastatin 40 mg daily-the West<disease> of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study ( WOSCOPS) and the pravastatin in elderly individuals at risk of vascular disease ( PROSPER) study. We described univariable and multivariable analyses of potential predictors of long-term care admission with corresponding survival curves of incident long-term care admission and analyses adjusted for competing risk. In total 11,015 ( 10 %) of the trial participants were admitted to long-term care. There was no difference between participants in the statin or placebo arms of either trial in regard to admissions to long-term care. On multivariable analyses , independent associations with incident long-term care admission in the PROSPER trial were age ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.06 per year , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.03-1.09) and male sex ( HR 0.72 , 95 % CI 0.53-0.99). In the WOSCOPS , age ( HR 1.12 per year , 95 % CI 1.10-1.13) and increasing social deprivation ( HR 1.05 , 95 % CI 1.03-1.08) were associated with incident long-term care admission. We did not demonstrate an association between historical statin use and future long-term care admission. The strongest associations with incident long-term care admission were non-modifiable factors of age , sex and socioeconomic deprivation.
