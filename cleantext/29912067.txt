  To quantify and identify factors associated with large RBC exposure in children supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Retrospective cohort study. Single tertiary care children 's hospital. One-hundred twenty-two children supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for greater than 12 hours during January 1 , 2015 , to December 31 , 2016. None. Clinical , laboratory , and survival data were obtained from medical records. Only data from patients ' first extracorporeal membrane oxygenation run were used. The primary outcome was RBC volume exposure during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( mL/kg/d). Patients with RBC exposure volume greater than 75th percentile were categorized as `` high RBC use '' patients. A `` bleeding day '' was identified if mediastinum or cannula sites were explored and/or Factor VIIa administration , gastrointestinal , pulmonary , or intracranial hemorrhages<symptom> occurred. Median age was 0.3 years ( interquartile range , 0-3 yr). Congenital heart disease ( n = 56; 46 %) was the most common diagnosis. Median RBC volume transfused during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was 39 mL/kg/d ( interquartile range , 21-66 mL/kg/d). High RBC use patients were more likely be supported by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( 100 vs 76 %; p = 0.006) , have congenital heart disease ( 68 vs 39 %; p = 0.02) , and experience bleeding ( 33 vs 11 % d; p < 0.001). High RBC use patients showed a trend toward higher in-hospital mortality ( 58 vs 37 %; p = 0.07). In the multivariable analysis , younger age ( -9 % per year; 95 % CI , -10 % to -7 %; p < 0.001) , more blood draws per day ( +8 %; 95 % CI , 6-11 %; p < 0.001) , and higher proportion of bleeding days ( +22 % per 10 % increase; 95 % CI , 16-29 %; p < 0.001) were associated with larger RBC exposure ( model R = 0.66). Bleeding during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , frequent laboratory draws , and younger age were associated with increased RBC exposure during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Higher transfusion volume was associated with increased mortality.
