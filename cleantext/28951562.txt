  Aberrant expression of CD19 in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) is commonly associated with t ( 8; 21) ( q22; q22) , although AML cases lacking this translocation occasionally express CD19. Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia<disease> also frequently expresses CD19. Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) technology is a major breakthrough for cancer treatment , with the recent approval of CD19-directed CAR ( CD19CAR) for treating B-cell malignancies. However , little information exists on using CD19CAR for other CD19 positive neoplasms such as AML. Our findings indicate that CD19CAR therapy can potentially be used for those with mixed phenotype leukemia<disease> and a subset of AML cases.
