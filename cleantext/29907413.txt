  A methodology based on solid-phase microextraction ( SPME) followed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( GC-MS/MS) has been developed for the simultaneous analysis of eleven multiclass ultraviolet ( UV) filters in beach sand. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that this extraction technique is applied to the analysis of UV filters in sand samples , and in other kind of environmental solid samples. Main extraction parameters such as the fibre coating , the amount of sample , the addition of salt , the volume of water added to the sand , and the temperature were optimized. An experimental design approach was implemented in order to find out the most favourable conditions. The final conditions consisted of adding 1 mL of water to 1 g of sample followed by the headspace SPME for 20 min at 100 Â°C , using PDMS/DVB as fibre coating. The SPME-GC-MS/MS method was validated in terms of linearity , accuracy , limits of detection and quantification , and precision. Recovery studies were also performed at three concentration levels in real Atlantic and Mediterranean sand samples. The recoveries were generally above 85 % and relative standard deviations below 11 %. The limits of detection were in the pg g
