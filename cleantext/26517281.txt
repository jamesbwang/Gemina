  Congenital diveticula and aneurysm<disease> of the heart are rare and most often located at the apex of the left ventricle. They pose a significant risk for cardiac failure and arrhythmias. In contrast , nonapical diverticula of the right ventricle ( RV) have a much more benign course. We present a child with Trisomy 21 , atrioventricular septal defect , and large nonapical diverticulum of the RV that was neither addressed during surgery nor needed any medical treatment during 1-year follow-up.
