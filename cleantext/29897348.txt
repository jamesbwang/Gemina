  Multifunctional electronics are attracting great interest with the increasing demand and fast development of wearable electronic devices. Here , we describe an epidermal strain sensor based on an all-carbon conductive network made from multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs) impregnated with poly ( dimethyl siloxane) ( PDMS) matrix through a vacuum filtration process. An ultrasonication treatment was performed to complete the penetration of PDMS resin in seconds. The entangled and overlapped MWCNT network largely enhances the electrical conductivity ( 1430 S m
