  The development of a treatment for alcohol use disorder ( AUD) is a crucial and complex moment. Indeed , the information gathered by a team of professionals ( physicians , psychologists and social workers) ( bio-psycho-social model of AUD) interact to choose the most appropriate cure. As for AUD psychological treatment , it is of considerable importance to avoid clinical treatments leading to drop-out for improving the patients quality of life. Psychoanalytic and behavioral techniques were early utilized as psychological treatment of AUD , however , evidence-based approaches as motivational interviewing ( MI) and cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT) are recently used in AUD. In this work we review the more effective and appropriate AUD psychological treatments.
