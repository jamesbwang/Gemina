  Herein we report the cycloisomerization of electron-poor 1,5-dienes via the Î²-azolium ylide to give enantioenriched cyclopentenes. The reaction is mediated by a chiral N-heterocyclic carbene ( NHC) catalyst , exploits readily available substrates , has good generality ( 17 examples) , and displays excellent enantioselectivity ( mostly > 94:6). Studies demonstrating the viability of a related dynamic kinetic resolution are reported , as are those with alternate tethers and derivatizations.
