  This study investigated differences in generic and soccer specific motor coordination , as well as speed and agility depending on age and maturity in elite youth soccer players ( U10-U15 , N = 619). Measurements included body height , body<symptom> weight and sitting height to estimate age at peak height velocity ( APHV); three Körperkoordinationstest für Kinder subtests ( i.e. jumping sideways ( JS) , moving sideways ( MS) , balancing backwards ( BB)) to assess generic motor coordination; the UGent dribbling test for soccer specific motor coordination; a 5m/30m sprint and T-test for speed and agility , respectively. Age specific z-scores of the predicted APHV identified players as earlier , on time or later maturing. ( M) ANOVA analyses showed significant age by maturity interaction effects for the speed and agility test cluster , revealing maturity related differences in U14 and U15 players. Next to an overall higher performance with age for all test clusters ( η
