  The present study evaluated the content and distribution of several trace elements ( Li , Be , Al , V , Cr , Co , Ni , Cu , Zn , Se , Mo , Ag , Cd , Sb , Ba , Tl , Pb , and U) in the Douro River estuary. For that , three matrices were collected ( water , sediments and native local flora) to assess the extent of contamination by these elements in this estuarine ecosystem. Results showed their occurrence in estuarine water and sediments , but significant differences were recorded on the concentration levels and pattern of distribution among both matrices and sampling points. Generally , the levels of trace elements were higher in the sediments than in the respective estuarine water. Nonetheless , no correlation among trace elements was determined between water and sediments , except for Cd. Al was the trace element found at highest concentration at both sediments and water followed by Zn. Pollution indices such as geo-accumulation ( I
