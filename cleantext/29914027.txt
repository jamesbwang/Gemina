  Alterations of intrinsic networks from resting state fMRI ( rs-fMRI) have been suggested as functional biomarkers of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). To determine the diagnostic accuracy of multicenter rs-fMRI for prodromal and preclinical stages of AD. We determined rs-fMRI functional connectivity based on Pearson 's correlation coefficients and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in people with subjective cognitive decline , people with mild cognitive impairment , and people with AD dementia compared with healthy controls. We used data of 247 participants of the prospective DELCODE study , a longitudinal multicenter observational study , imposing a unified fMRI acquisition protocol across sites. We determined cross-validated discrimination accuracy based on penalized logistic regression to account for multicollinearity of predictors. Resting state functional connectivity reached significant cross-validated group discrimination only for the comparison of AD dementia cases with healthy controls , but not for the other diagnostic groups. AD dementia cases showed alterations in a large range of intrinsic resting state networks , including the default mode and salience networks , but also executive and language networks. When groups were stratified according to their CSF amyloid status that was available in a subset of cases , diagnostic accuracy was increased for amyloid positive mild cognitive impairment cases compared with amyloid negative controls , but still inferior to the accuracy of hippocampus volume. Even when following a strictly harmonized data acquisition protocol and rigorous scan quality control , widely used connectivity measures of multicenter rs-fMRI do not reach levels of diagnostic accuracy sufficient for a useful biomarker in prodromal stages of AD.
