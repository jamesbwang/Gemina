  Psychosis is characterized by problems in social functioning that exist well before illness onset , and in individuals at clinical high risk ( CHR) for psychosis. Trust is an essential element for social interactions that is impaired in psychosis. In the trust game , chronic patients showed reduced baseline trust , impaired response to positive social feedback , and attenuated brain activation in reward and mentalizing areas. We investigated whether first-episode psychosis patients ( FEP) and CHR show similar abnormalities in the neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying trust. Twenty-two FEP , 17 CHR , and 43 healthy controls performed two trust games , with a cooperative and an unfair partner in the fMRI scanner. Region of interest analyses were performed on mentalizing and reward processing areas , during the investment and outcome phases of the games. Compared with healthy controls , FEP and CHR showed reduced baseline trust , but like controls , learned to trust in response to cooperative and unfair feedback. Symptom severity was not associated with baseline trust , however in FEP associated with reduced response to feedback. The only group differences in brain activation were that CHR recruited the temporo-parietal junction ( TPJ) more than FEP and controls during investment in the unfair condition. This hyper-activation in CHR was associated with greater symptom severity. Reduced baseline trust may be associated with risk for psychotic illness , or generally with poor mental health. Feedback learning is still intact in CHR and FEP , as opposed to chronic patients. CHR however show distinct neural activation patterns of hyper-activation of the TPJ.
