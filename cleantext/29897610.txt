  Ocrelizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen on B cells. It has recently been approved by the US ( Food and Drug Administration) and European health agencies ( European Medicines Agency) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis ( MS) and is the first drug marketed for both relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS) and primary progressive MS ( PPMS). The clinical trials conducted for both the relapsing forms ( OPERA I/II) and the progressive forms of the disease ( ORATORIO) have demonstrated its efficacy. The aim of this review is to address the main aspects of the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in MS. Using PubMed , a literature review was conducted of studies published at the ECTRIMS 2017 Congress and of active studies in ClinicalTrials. In order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in MS , both randomised clinical trials and their extension and follow-up studies were reviewed , and information about its safety obtained from monitoring programmes of the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency was included. Ocrelizumab is the first drug that has been shown to be able to significantly slow disability progression at 12 and 24 weeks in patients with PPMS. It is also effective in controlling clinical and radiological activity in patients with RRMS forms , and it is approved and indicated for both phenotypes of the disease. To date , the safety profile of ocrelizumab matches that observed in clinical trials , without any unexpected alerts.
