  Individuals with social anxiety<symptom> have various types of deficiencies in emotional processing. Diversity of deficiencies may imply that socially anxious individuals have malfunctions in fundamental parts of emotional processing. Therefore , we hypothesized that social anxiety<symptom> contributes to deficiencies in building on the metaphorical relationship between emotional experience and brightness. We conducted a judgment task of valences of faces with manipulated clothing brightness ( bright or dark). A congruency effect between the emotional valence and clothing brightness was observed in participants with low social anxiety<symptom>. However , this pattern was not found in participants with high social anxiety<symptom>. The results suggested that a deficiency in metaphorical associations leads to maladaptive emotional processing in individuals with social anxiety<symptom>. Our findings can not be directly generalized to clinical populations. Such populations should be tested in the future studies. We may expand Lakoff and Johnson 's ( 1999) conceptual metaphor theory by showing the relationships between social anxiety<symptom> and malfunction in metaphorical processing. Malfunctions in metaphorical processing could lead to various types of psychological disorders which have deficiencies in emotional processing.
