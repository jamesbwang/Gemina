  The aim of our study is to examine vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials ( VEMPs) elicited by the galvanic vestibular stimulation in the sternocleidomastoid muscle ( SCM) in healthy subjects for clinical applications of auditory neuropathy or vestibular neuropathy in the future. We enrolled sixteen healthy subjects to record the average responses of SCM to galvanic vestibular stimulation ( GVS) ( current 3 mA; duration 1 ms) by electromyography ( EMG). SPSS18 .0 software was used to analyze the obtained data for mean and standard deviation. In all healthy subjects mastoid-forehead galvanic vestibular stimulation produced a positive-negative biphasic EMG responses on SCM ipsilateral to the cathodal electrode. The latency of p13 was 11.7 ± 3.0 ms. The latency of n23 was 17.8 ± 3.4 ms. The amplitude of p13-n23 was 147.0 ± 69.0 μV. The interaural asymmetry ratio ( AR) of p13 , n23 latency and the amplitude was respectively 0.12 ± 0.09 , 0.08 ± 0.08 and 0.16 ± 0.10. Galvanic vestibular stimulation could elicit biphasic EMG responses from SCM via the vestibular nerve but not from the otolith organs. Galvanic stimulation together with air conducted sound<symptom> ( ACS) or bone conducted vibration ( BCV) can elicit VEMPs and may enable the differentiation of retrolabyrinthine lesions<symptom> from labyrinthine lesions<symptom> in vestibular system.
