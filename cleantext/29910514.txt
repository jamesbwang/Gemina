  The transition from amateur to professional in natural history is generally regarded as having taken place in the nineteenth century , but landmark events such as the 1917 appointment of mycologist Johanna Westerdijk ( 1883-1961) as the first female professor in the Netherlands indicate that the pattern of change for women was more varied and delayed than for men. We investigate this transition in mycology , and identify only 43 women in the Western World who published scientific mycological literature pre-1900 , of whom twelve published new fungal taxa. By charting the emergence of these women over time , and comparing the output of self-taught amateurs and university graduates , we establish the key role of access to higher education in female participation in mycology. Using a suite of strategies , six of the self-taught amateurs managed to overcome their educational disadvantages and name names- Catharina Dörrien ( the first to name a fungal taxon) , Marie-Anne Libert , Mary Elizabeth Banning , Élise-Caroline Bommer , Mariette Rousseau , and Annie Lorrain Smith. By 1900 , the professional era for women in mycology was underway , and increasing numbers published new taxa. Parity with male colleagues in recognition and promotion , however , remains an ongoing issue.
