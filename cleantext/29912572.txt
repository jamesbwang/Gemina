  To compare the anatomical and functional results achieved with subretinal fluid drainage ( SRFD) and perfluorocarbon liquid ( PFCL) use in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment ( RRD) treated by primary pars plana vitrectomy ( PPV). The study included 162 eyes of 162 patients who underwent PPV for RRD , either with PFCL ( n = 108) or SRFD ( n = 54). The two groups were matched in 2:1 ratio for age , gender , and lens status. Groups were compared for rates of retinal reattachment , visual improvement , and the occurrence of recurrent RRD and any other postoperative complications. Both groups had a single surgery success rate of 90.7 % , and 100 % of retinas were reattached by the end of follow-up. Both groups had similar final VA ( 0.30 ± 0.39 logMAR in the SRFD group and 0.35 ± 0.44 in the PFCL group; p = 0.48) and degrees of visual improvement ( 0.64 ± 0.75 logMAR in the SRFD group and 0.59 ± 0.89 in the PFC group; p = 0.71). Complication rates were also similar between groups. The rate of additional interventions was higher ( although not statistically significant) in the PFCL group than the SRFD group , due to cases of PFCL retention ( 4.6 % vs. 1.8 % , respectively). Both PFCL and SRFD achieved excellent results in terms of retinal reattachment and visual improvement , and have comparable safety profiles. A slightly higher rate of additional surgeries was found in the PFCL group. These findings indicate that PFCL are not necessary in routine PPV for RRD , as they do not improve the results achieved with SRFD and may be less cost-effective due to their higher price and potential for a higher rate of additional surgeries.
