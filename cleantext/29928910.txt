  Wide-ranging prevalence estimates of psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( PsA) in patients with psoriasis have been reported. To assess the prevalence and incidence of PsA in patients with psoriasis. Two authors independently searched three databases for studies reporting on the prevalence or incidence of PsA in patients with psoriasis. A proportion meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled proportion estimates of PsA in patients with psoriasis. A total of 266 studies were included , examining 976,408 patients with psoriasis. Overall , the pooled proportion ( 95 % confidence interval) of PsA among patients with psoriasis was 19.7 % ( 18.5 % -20.9 %). In children and adolescents ( < 18 years) , the pooled prevalence was 3.3 % ( 2.1 % -4.9 %). The PsA prevalence was 22.7 % ( 20.6 % -25.0 %) in European , 21.5 % ( 15.4 % -28.2 %) South American , 19.5 % ( 17.1 % -22.1 %) North American , 15.5 % ( 0.009 % -51.5 %) African , and 14.0 % ( 11.7 % -16.3 %) in Asian psoriasis patients. The prevalence of PsA was 23.8 % ( 20.1 % -27.6 %) in studies where the ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis<disease> ( CASPAR) was applied. The incidence of PsA among psoriasis patients ranged from 0.27 to 2.7 per 100 person-years. Between-study heterogeneity may have affected the estimates. We found that one in five patients with psoriasis have PsA. With the growing recognition of CASPAR , more homogenous and comparable prevalence estimates are expected to be reported.
