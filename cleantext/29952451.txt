  Much has been achieved in clinical and scientific research in the past 130 years by Beijing Tongren Hospital , which has evolved from an eye clinic to a comprehensive hospital with an ophthalmology department known as one of the best in China. This article presents the most historic moments and events in the development of a hospital with the largest eye care service volume. In addition , given the leading position of Tongren , the development of ophthalmology in Tongren is also the epitome of the development of modern ophthalmology in China. Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology ( BIO) was established in 1959 as an affiliated institution under Tongren , aiming at carrying out applied science and basic science research , and directors of BIO have thus far served 4 terms as president of the Chinese Ophthalmological Society. In 2002 , Beijing Tongren Eye Center ( hereafter referred to as the Eye Center) was established to combine all the ophthalmic resources within Tongren. In 2017 , the Eye Center alone had a surgical volume of 78,223 , with surgeries for cataract , refractive errors , fundus , glaucoma , and corneal disease being the 5 most common , and 902,409 outpatient visits. Equipped with the leading experts and equipment , Tongren is dedicated to the battle against major eye diseases by carrying out large population-based epidemiological surveys and basic science research on pathogenesis and effective treatments , thereby making contributions to the development of the science of ophthalmology along with the delivery of eye care services in China and beyond.
