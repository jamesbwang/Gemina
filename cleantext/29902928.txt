  Secondhand smoke exposure ( SHSe) is predictive of greater nicotine dependence ( ND) and poor smoking cessation ( SC) outcomes. SHSe and its impact on ND and SC attempts in people with psychiatric disorders ( PD) remain poorly understood. Hence , the objectives of this study were to ( 1) quantify SHSe , ( 2) examine the association of SHSe with ND , and ( 3) assess the association between SHSe and SC among tobacco users with PD. A cross-sectional survey of 118 tobacco users in an inpatient psychiatric facility was conducted. Data on demographics , tobacco use and SHSe history , motivation to quit smoking , ND , and SC attempts were obtained. Participants ' environmental and psychosocial sources of and perceived SHSe were described. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the associations between SHSe and ND , while logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between SHSe and SC. The primary sources of environmental SHSe were from the car ( 63.6 %) and home ( 51.7 %); primary sources of psychosocial SHSe were close friends ( 67.8 %) and parents/grandparents ( 65.3 %); and mean perceived SHSe was 6.2 ( SD = 3.5). Although perceived SHSe was significantly associated with ND ( Î² = .39 , p < .0001) in multivariate analyses , no SHSe variable was associated with SC. However , scores on items measuring motivation to quit smoking were associated with SC attempts. Patients with PD reported high levels of SHSe , which was associated with higher ND. Routine screening for SHSe should be implemented as part of health assessments in this population to address ND treatment options. Moreover , targeted interventions and policies should be considered toward reducing SHSe in this vulnerable population.
