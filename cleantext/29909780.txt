  Computed tomography is the standard pre-operative imaging modality for sinonasal papilloma. The complementary use of magnetic resonance imaging as an additional investigation is debated. This study aimed to establish whether magnetic resonance imaging can accurately detect tumour extent and is a useful adjunct to computed tomography. A retrospective review was conducted on 19 patients with sinonasal papilloma. The interpretation of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans , by three clinicians , was conducted by comparing prediction of tumour extent. The perceived necessity of magnetic resonance imaging was compared between clinicians. The addition of magnetic resonance imaging improved accuracy of pre-operative interpretation; specifically , this finding was significant in cases with frontal sinus involvement. Surgeons were more likely than a radiologist to request magnetic resonance imaging , particularly when computed tomography indicated frontal sinus disease. Pre-operative combined magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography helped predict disease in the frontal sinus better than computed tomography alone. A close working relationship between the ENT and radiology departments is important for accurate tumour localisation.
