  The role of underlying genetic factors in the pathogenesis of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts ( NSOC) remains poorly understood. Although genomewide association studies ( GWASs) of NSOC have successfully identified a large number of novel genetic risk loci , association results of replication studies are inconsistent across different populations. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) ( rs7922405 at 10q26 .3 , rs73039426 at 19q13 .11 , rs7552 at 2p24 .2 , rs1788160 at 8q22 .2 , rs9381107 at 6p24 .3 , and rs17095681 at 10q25 .3) were analyzed for an association with NSOC in 1062 participants of Chinese descent ( 596 patients and 466 controls). We applied the multifactor dimensionality reduction ( MDR) method to detect potential gene-gene ( G × G) interactions in the six SNPs. The genotype or allele frequencies of SNPs rs7922405 , rs73039426 , and rs7552 showed significant differences between the controls and patients with NSOC , whereas no association was shown between three SNPs ( rs1788160 , rs17095681 , and rs9381107) and NSOC. MDR analysis did not reveal significant G × G interactions for susceptibility to NSOC. We confirmed that three genes ( rs7922405 of MGMT , rs73039426 of RHPN2 , and rs7552 of FAM49A) may contribute to NSOC in Chinese populations. MGMT and RHPN2 are associated with NSOC , which is herein demonstrated for the first time.
