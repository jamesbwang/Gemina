  In 2008 , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS) stopped reimbursing for hospital-acquired conditions ( HACs) not present on admission ( POA). We sought to understand why this policy did not impact central line-associated bloodstream infection ( CLABSI) and catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( CAUTI) trends. Retrospective cohort study. Acute-care hospitals in the United States.ParticipantsFee-for-service Medicare patients discharged January 1 , 2007 , through December 31 , 2011. Using inpatient Medicare claims data , we analyzed billing practices before and after the HAC policy was implemented , including the use and POA designation of codes for CLABSI or CAUTI. For the 3-year period following policy implementation , we determined the impact on diagnosis-related groups ( DRG) determining reimbursement as well as hospital characteristics associated with the reimbursement impact. During the study period , 65,205,607 Medicare fee-for-service hospitalizations occurred at 3,291 acute-care , nonfederal US hospitals. Based on coding , CLABSI and CAUTI affected 0.23 % and 0.06 % of these hospitalizations , respectively. In addition , following the HAC policy , 82 % of the CLABSI codes and 91 % of the CAUTI codes were marked POA , which represented a large increase in the use of this designation. Finally , for the small numbers of CLABSI and CAUTI coded as not POA , financial impacts were detected on only 0.4 % of the hospitalizations with a CLABSI code and 5.7 % with a CAUTI code. Part of the reason the HAC policy did not have its intended impact is that billing codes for CLABSI and CAUTI were rarely used , were commonly listed as POA in the postpolicy period , and infrequently impacted hospital reimbursement.
