  We evaluated the effects of three different surface treatments and two different bonding procedures on shear bond strength of resin composites to different computer-aided design/manufacturing ( CAD/CAM) ceramics with or without thermocycling. The test specimens were prepared from three different CAD/CAM ceramics ( Group A , IPS e.max CAD; Group B , IPS e.max ZirCAD; Group C , Vita Suprinity). They were divided into eight subgroups according to the surface treatment and bonding procedures. After resin composite was applied to the surfaces of all test specimens , they were stored in distilled water for 24 h at 37
