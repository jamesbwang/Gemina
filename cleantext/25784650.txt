  Breast cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Aberrant regulation of various growth factors , cytokines , and other proteins and their receptors in cancer cells drives the activation of various oncogenic signaling pathways that lead to cancer progression. Semaphorins are a class of proteins which are differentially expressed in various types of cancer including breast cancer. Earlier , these proteins were known to have a major function in the nerve cell adhesion , migration , and development of the central nervous system. However , their role in the regulation of several aspects of tumor progression has eventually emerged. There are over 30 genes encoding the semaphorins , which are divided into eight subclasses. It has been reported that some members of semaphorin classes are antiangiogenic and antimetastatic in nature , whereas others act as proangiogenic and prometastatic genes. Because of their differential expression and role in angiogenesis and metastasis , semaphorins emerged as one of the important prognostic factors for appraising breast cancer progression.
