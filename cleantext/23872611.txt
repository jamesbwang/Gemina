  Increasing trends of resistance-associated mutations ( RAMs) to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors ( nNRTIs) have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the regimens in the national HIV<pathogen> treatment programs in resource-limited countries. We aimed to retrospectively investigate the incidence and patterns of emergent RAMs of HIV-1 in HIV-positive adults experiencing virological failure to first-line nNRTI-containing combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART) in Taiwan. Between June 2012 and March 2016 , 1138 antiretroviral-naïve HIV-positive adults without baseline RAMs who initiated nNRTI-containing regimens were included for analysis. Virological failure was defined as plasma viral load ( PVL) ≥ 200 copies/mL after 6 months of cART or confirmed PVL ≥ 200 copies/mL after achieving PVL < 50 copies/mL. Population sequencing was retrospectively performed to detect baseline and emergent RAMs. RAMs were interpreted using the International AIDS Society-USA 2016 mutations list. Seventy-one patients ( 6.2 %) developed virological failure , which occurred in 14.8 % ( 43/291) , 3.9 % ( 26/675) , and 1.2 % ( 2/172) of patients receiving 2 nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs) plus nevirapine , efavirenz , and rilpivirine , respectively. Among those , 53 ( 74.6 %) had emergent RAMs identified , which included 43 ( 81.1 %) , 53 ( 100.0 %) , and 1 ( 1.9 %) with RAMs to NRTIs , nNRTIs , and protease inhibitors , respectively; and 43 ( 81.1 %) had multi-drug resistance. The most common emergent RAMs to NRTIs were M184V/I ( 42.3 %) and K65R ( 28.2 %) , and those to nNRTIs were Y181C ( 42.3 %) , K103N ( 15.5 %) , G190A/E/Q ( 12.7 %) , V179D/E ( 12.7 %) , and V108I ( 9.9 %). While the rates of virological failure varied with the nNRTI used , the rate of emergent RAMs of HIV-1 to NRTIs and nNRTIs among the antiretroviral-naïve patients who failed nNRTI-containing cART remained low.
