  Commensal bacteria are the representative of the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes present in a community. The usage of antibiotics along with the demographic factors is generally associated with an increase in antibiotics resistance in pathogens. Northeast ( NE) India is untapped with regard to antibiotic resistance prevalence and spread. In the current study , the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant commensal Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in pre-school and school-going children ( n = 550 , 1-14 years old) from the rural areas of the state of Sikkim-an NE Indian state , with respect to associated demographic factors was investigated. A total of 550 fecal E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates were collected during July 2015 to June 2017. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data to ascertain the potential factors associated with the carriage of antibiotic resistance E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> among the children. Statistical analysis along with a logistic regression identified potential external factors affecting the observed antibiotic resistance pattern. The data indicated a high prevalence of resistance to common antibiotics like ampicillin ( 92 %) , ceftazidime ( 90 %) , cefoxitin ( 88 %) , streptomycin ( 40 %) and tetracycline ( 36 %) , but no resistance to chloramphenicol. The resistance to the combination of penicillin and quinolone group of antibiotics was observed in fifty-two percent of the isolates. A positive correlation between the harboring of antibiotics resistant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> with different demographic factors was observed such as , with children living in nuclear family ( vs joint family 63.15 % , OR 0.18 , 95 % CI: 0.11-0.28 , p < 0.01) , below higher secondary maternal education ( vs college graduates 59.27 % OR 0.75 , 95 % CI: 0.55-1.02 , p < 0.02). A close association between different demographic factors and the high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant commensal E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in the current study suggests a concern over rising misuse of antibiotics that warrants a future threat of emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogen isolates.
