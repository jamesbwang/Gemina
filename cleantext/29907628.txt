  To investigate the frequency and patient characteristics that influence anatomic response of intravitreal aflibercept in treatment-naïve neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). Retrospective , interventional , consecutive case series. Three hundred and sixty-five eyes of 365 patients with AMD who underwent 3 monthly intravitreal aflibercept treatments with follow-up for at least 12 months were investigated. Treatment response was evaluated as follows. Responders were defined as those with complete resolution of exudation , including intraretinal oedema , subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment , or more than a 100 µm decrease of central retinal thickness at 3 months compared with baseline. Non-responders were defined as patients exhibiting an increase in exudation or a decreased central retinal thickness of less than 100 µm. Nineteen ( 5.2 %) of 365 eyes were identified as non-responders. The remaining were responders to intravitreal aflibercept. The non-responders group was significantly associated with choroidal vascular hyperpermeability on indocyanine green angiography and lower frequency of subretinal hyper-reflective materials on optical coherence tomography. The central choroidal thickness at baseline and after 3 monthly injections tended to be thicker in the non-responder group than the responder group , although the differences did not meet statistical significance ( p = 0.066 and p = 0.051 , respectively). Additional treatments with either intravitreal ranibizumab or PDT in combination with aflibercept were effective in 15 ( 79 %) of 19 non-responders. Intravitreal aflibercept is effective for treating eye pathology in most naïve AMD cases. However , non-responsiveness may occur in small subgroup of patients with choroidal vascular hyperpermeability.
