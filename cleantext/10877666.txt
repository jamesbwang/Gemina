  We have recently shown that male Rhes knockout ( KO) mice develop a mild form of spontaneous Parkinson 's disease ( PD)- like phenotype , characterized by motor impairment and a decrease in nigrostriatal dopamine ( DA) neurons. Experimental evidence has implicated neuroinflammation in PD progression , and the presence of activated glial cells has been correlated with DA neuron degeneration. Despite this , several factors , such as gender , have been found to affect DAergic neuron degeneration and influence neuroinflammation , explaining the differences between men and women in the etiology of PD. On these basis , we studied age and gender differences in DA neuron degeneration and gliosis in the nigrostriatal system of adult ( 3-month-old) and middle aged ( 12-month-old) male and female Rhes wild-type ( WT) and KO mice. Through immunohistochemistry , tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH) , microglial ( complement type 3 receptor ( CD11b)) and astroglial ( glial fibrillary acid protein ( GFAP)) increase , were evaluated. Adult male Rhes KO mice showed a decrease in TH and an increase in CD11b , both in the caudate putamen ( CPu) and substantia nigra pars compacta ( SNc) , and an increase in GFAP in the CPu. In contrast , adult female Rhes KO mice showed only a decrease in TH in the SNc , whereas no modifications to the levels of GFAP and CD11b were observed in the CPu or SNc. Middle aged male Rhes KO mice showed a decrease in TH in the CPu and SNc , and an increase in GFAP and CD11b in the SNc. Middle aged female Rhes KO mice showed a decrease in TH in the CPu and SNc and an increase in CD11b only in the CPu , but no modifications to GFAP levels. The more marked DA neuron degeneration and neuroinflammation in male compared with female Rhes KO mice , while confirming the role of Rhes as an important protein for DA neuron survival , gives support to Rhes KO mice as a valuable preclinical model for studying the vulnerability factors of DA neuron degeneration as in PD.
