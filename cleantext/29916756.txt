  To investigate the association between risk factors and pain-related symptoms and clinical signs of temporomandibular disorders ( TMD) in Northern Finland Birth Cohort ( NFBC) 1966. A total of 1962 subjects ( 1050 women , 912 men) attended the follow-up study. The questionnaires included the subjects ' background information concerning living conditions and general health , socioeconomic factors , and dental health. The clinical examination was performed using the modified protocol of Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders ( DC/TMD) presented at the International Association for Dental Research ( IADR) Conference in 2010. Cross-tabulation , a chi-square test and Fisher 's exact test were used to analyze differences between groups. Female gender showed statistically significant association with symptoms and signs of TMD , while marital status , living conditions , and socioeconomic group showed no association. A strong association was found between self-reported health condition as well as general health problems ( i.e. depression<symptom> , migraine , fibromyalgia ( FM) , gastrointestinal diseases) and TMD pain-related symptoms and pain on palpation in the masticatory muscles and TMJs. In conclusion , general health problems and female gender had a strong association with pain-related symptoms and clinical signs of TMD. These findings are important to take into account when diagnosing and treating TMD patients. Conversely to earlier presented results , no statistically significant association was shown here between marital status , living conditions or socioeconomic group and pain-related symptoms and clinical signs of TMD.
