  A rainwater harvesting system ( RWHS) was proposed for small and large commercial buildings in Malaysia as an alternative water supply for non-potable water consumption. The selected small and large commercial buildings are AEON Taman Universiti and AEON Bukit Indah , respectively. Daily rainfall data employed in this work were obtained from the nearest rainfall station at Senai International Airport , which has the longest and reliable rainfall record ( 29 years). Water consumption at both buildings were monitored daily and combined with the secondary data obtained from the AEON 's offices. The mass balance<symptom> model was adopted as the simulation approach. In addition , the economic benefits of RWHS in terms of percentage of reliability ( R) , net present value ( NPV) , return on investment ( ROI) , benefit-cost ratio ( BCR) , and payback period ( PBP) were examined. Effects of rainwater tank sizes and water tariffs on the economic indicators were also evaluated. The results revealed that the percentages of reliability of the RWHS for the small and large commercial buildings were up to 93 and 100 % , respectively , depending on the size of rainwater tank use. The economic benefits of the proposed RWHS were highly influenced by the tank size and water tariff. At different water tariffs between RM 3.0/ m
