  perforation of the upper aerodigestive tract is a potentially life-threatening condition. The appropriate treatment of cervical esophageal perforation is still controversial. we report a case of cervical esophageal perforation that was effectively treated by a conservative management with acrylic glue injection. the management of cervical esophageal perforations has been controversial and little studied. Various treatment options , including surgical and nonsurgical management have been advocated , and no gold standard surgical treatment has yet been established. Some authors have recommended immediate surgical intervention , especially in penetrating trauma , conversely , several studies support conservative management. we consider that the application of acrylic glue can be considered a promising , minimally invasive therapeutic option in the management of cervical esophageal perforation. However , the sufficient accumulation of similarly treated cases is necessary in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of this treatment modality.
