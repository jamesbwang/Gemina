  An agriculturally important insecticidal bacterium<pathogen> , Bacillus<pathogen> thuringiensis<pathogen> have been isolated from the soil samples of various part of Assam including the Kaziranga National Park. Previously , the isolates were characterized based on morphology , 16S rDNA sequencing , and the presence of the various classes ' crystal protein gene ( s). In the present study , the phylogenetic analysis of a few selected isolates was performed by an unambiguous and quick method called the multiple locus sequence typing ( MLST). A known B.<pathogen> thuringiensis<pathogen> strain kurstaki 4D4 have been used as a reference strain for MLST. A total of four the MLST locus of housekeeping genes , recF , sucC , gdpD and yhfL were selected. A total of 14 unique sequence types ( STs) was identified. A total number of alleles identified for the locus gdpD and sucC was 12 , followed by locus yhfL was 11 , however , only 6 alleles were detected for the locus recF. The phylogenetic analysis using MEGA 7.0.26 showed three major lineages. Approximately , 87 % of the isolates belonged to the STs corresponding to B.<pathogen> thuringiensis<pathogen> , whereas two isolates , BA07 and BA39 , were clustered to B.<pathogen> cereus<pathogen>. The isolates were also screened for the diversity of vegetative insecticidal protein ( vip) genes. In all , 8 isolates showed the presence of vip1 , followed by 7 isolates having vip2 and 6 isolates for vip3 genes. The expression of Vip3A proteins was analyzed by western blot analyses and expression of the Vip3A protein was observed in the isolate BA20. Thus , the phylogenetic relationship and diversity of Bt isolates from Assam soil was established based on MLST , in addition , found isolates having vip genes , which could be used for crop improvement.
