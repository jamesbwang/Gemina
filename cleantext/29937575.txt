  Given its modest position as a lower-middle income country , Vietnam stands out from the rest of the world with its remarkable performance on standardized test scores , school enrollment , and completed years of schooling. We provide an overview of the factors behind this exemplary performance both from an institutional viewpoint and by analyzing several different data sources , some of which have rarely been used. Some of the highlights are universal primary school enrollment , higher girls ' net enrollment rates , and the role of within-commune individual factors. We further discuss a host of challenges for the country-most of which have received insufficient attention to date.
