  Kiwifruit ( Actinidia deliciosa) is a high-acidity fruit , with two varieties available on the market. One is the green-fleshed , fuzzy , sweet but tangy-tasting kiwifruit , and the other is the yellow-fleshed variety called `` golden '' kiwifruit. While the whole kiwifruit is sold at room temperature at grocery stores , sliced kiwifruit is usually sold as a part of fruit salad in the refrigerated section. The survival of a five-strain Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 cocktail , a five-strain Salmonella<pathogen> cocktail , and a five-strain Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> cocktail was evaluated on whole and sliced green and golden kiwifruit. Two inoculation levels were tested ( ∼ 7 and ∼ 4 Log colony-forming unit ( CFU)/ kiwi). A significantly higher amount of wet inoculum was attached to the green kiwifruit than to the golden kiwifruit ( p < 0.05). The scanning electron microscope examination showed that pathogens can attach on both the surface and the hair structure of green kiwi skin. At room temperature , all three pathogens survived for 30 days on whole kiwifruit. Although the pH of sliced kiwifruit was low ( ∼ 3.5) , all three pathogens survived on sliced kiwifruit for 7 days when stored at 4 °C. These results highlight the importance of preventing contamination of fresh fruit during the preharvest and processing stages.
