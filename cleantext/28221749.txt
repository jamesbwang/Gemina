  Graphene nanowalls ( GNWs) with different sizes ( i.e. , length and height) were grown directly on the surface of individual carbon fibers ( CFs) using a radio frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( RF-PECVD) technique. The size was controlled by varying the deposition time. The GNW-modified CFs were embedded into epoxy resin matrix to prepare a series of carbon-fiber-reinforced composites ( CFRCs). The results indicated that GNWs were remarkably effective in improving the interfacial shear strength ( IFSS) and interlaminar shear strength ( ILSS) of the carbon-fiber-reinforced composites. The enhancement effect on the strength strongly depended on the size of GNWs. It increased with the increase in the GNWs & rsquo; size and reached the maximum upon the incorporation of GNWs that were grown for 45 min. Noticeable increases of 222.8 % and 41.1 % were observed in IFSS and ILSS , respectively. The enhancement mechanism was revealed by means of scanning electron microscope ( SEM) fractography analysis. However , further increase of GNW size led to no more improvement in the shear strength. It could result from the increased defect concentration and wrinkle size in the GNWs , which deteriorated the strength.
