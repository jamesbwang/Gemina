  The objective of this study was to determine the effects of deboning time ( pre- and post-rigor) , processing steps ( grinding- GB; salting- SB; batter formulation- BB) , and storage time on the quality of raw beef mixtures and vacuum-packaged cooked sausage , produced using a commercial formulation with 0.25 % phosphate. The pH was greater in pre-rigor GB and SB than in post-rigor GB and SB ( P < .001). However , deboning time had no effect on metmyoglobin reducing activity , cooking loss , and color of raw beef mixtures. Protein solubility of pre-rigor beef mixtures ( 124.26 mg/kg) was greater than that of post-rigor beef ( 113.93 mg/kg; P = .071). TBARS were increased in BB but decreased during vacuum storage of cooked sausage ( P â‰¤ .018). Except for chewiness and saltiness being 52.9 N-mm and 0.3 points greater in post-rigor sausage ( P = .040 and 0.054 , respectively) , texture profile analysis and trained panelists detected no difference in texture between pre- and post-rigor sausage.
