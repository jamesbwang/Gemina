  Homeostatic synaptic plasticity ( HSP) helps to stabilize the neuronal network activity , which is essential for optimal information coding. Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity that stabilizes neuronal firing in response to activity blockade. Lead ( Pb) is a ubiquitous environmental neuro-toxicant and can impair the input-specific Hebbian type synaptic plasticity , but whether Pb exerts effects in HSP remains unknown. We previously reported that blocking L-type calcium channel induces synaptic scaling , which stimulates the synthesis of all-trans retinoic acid ( RA) and the expression of GluA2-lacking α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ( AMPA) receptor. Given Pb is a potent blocker of calcium channel , we hypothesized Pb may participate in synaptic scaling accompanied by RA synthesis and AMPA receptor trafficking. In this study , cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with Pb ( 1μM 5 min , 15 min , 4h , 24h and 10μM 24h) alone or in combination with tetrodotoxin ( TTX , 1μM , 24h). The results showed that Pb alone , either at 1μM or 10μM , can not induce synaptic scaling. But Pb participated in synaptic scaling when concurrent with TTX ( 10μM Pb + 1μM TTX , 24h). Further results showed that surface heteromeric GluA1 and GluA2 AMPA receptors were increased in TTX + Pb induced synaptic scaling. In addition , RA was proved not to participate in TTX + Pb mediated synaptic scaling. Taken together , our work supported that TTX + Pb could induce synaptic scaling and enhance synaptic accumulation of AMPAR GluA1 and GluA2 during synaptic up scaling. Our study would help for elucidation of the Pb-induced neuronal network instability mechanism.
