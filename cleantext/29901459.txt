  The incidence of pediatric nephrolithiasis is on the rise , with a significant related morbidity and a concomitant relevant increase in healthcare costs. The purpose of this review is to portray the current epidemiology and cause of renal stones in children , to provide a framework for appropriate clinical evaluation on an individual basis , and a guidance regarding treatment and prevention for the significant risk of lifelong recurrence and deriving complications. The early identification of modifiable risk factors and other abnormalities is essential , to prevent related morbidity , the onset of chronic kidney disease , and the associated increased risk of developing other diseases. The implementation of risk reduction strategies , including dietary modifications and targeted pharmacological therapies , will significantly influence stone recurrences and preserve renal function. Future research is desirable , with the aim to strengthen personalized conservative management of pediatric nephrolithiasis as first-line treatment.
