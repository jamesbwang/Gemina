  Evidences suggest that central hemodynamics indexes are independent predictors of future cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Multiple factors have been pointed to have potential influence on central aortic function: height , heart rate , left ventricular ejection duration and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> level. Data related to the influence of gender and postmenopausal status on aortic waveform reflection is scarce. We aim to evaluate the impact of gender and menopause on central blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of hypertensive patients. In a cross sectional study 122 hypertensive patients ( 52 men and 70 women) were studied. Hypertension was defined as blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) levels ≥ 140/90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive drugs. Central arterial pressure , augmentation index ( AIx) and augmentation index normalized to 75 bpm ( AIx75) were obtained using applanation tonometry. Menopause and postmenopause history were accessed by a direct series of questions. Postmenopause was defined as at least one year since last menstruation. Patients were paired by age , gender and menopausal status , and the data were compared considering gender and menopausal status. Height and weight were significantly lower in women than in men at the same age. Conversely , AIx ( 32.7 ± 9.8 % vs. 20.1 ± 11.7 % , p < 0.01) , AIx75 ( 29.6 ± 6.7 % vs. 18.3 ± 9.4 % , p < 0.01) and central systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( 136 ± 30 vs. 125 ± 23 mmHg , p = 0.03) were higher in women than men. The menopausal women ( mean age of menopause = 48 years) had the worst indexes of aortic wave reflection , compared to men at the same age and younger women. Hypertensive women had both higher reflected aortic pressure waveform and central blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> indexes than hypertensive men , and these findings were worsened by the menopausal status.
