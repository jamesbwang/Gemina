  Stress is an emotional condition , mostly experienced as negative , initially identified and defined by Selye in the mid-thirties of the last Century. Since the first definition , stress concerns the adaptation pro- cess mostly related to environmental changes. An application of stress focuses on the evaluation of its interference on work conditions , and the scientific evidence on work related stress is very ample and rich. We are proposing a new ad hoc questionnaire for the multidimensional assessment of work related stress , called Stress Perception Question- naire of Rome ( SPQR) composed of 50 items. The development of this questionnaire is based on a multi-step process: a) Identification of all the relevant topics to work related stress and areas in the scientific evidence and their transformation on specific contents of 60 tentative items; b) Exploratory factor analysis aimed to identify the best items ( 50) which could guarantee the maximum convergence on single scales ( 8) , and the minimum redundancy between scales; c) Validation of the 8 scales ' structure by a confirmatory factor analysis ( fully achieved); d) Factor analysis for a second level factor resulting in a single factor identified as the questionnaire total score ( Stress Score); d) Reliability analysis of the questionnaire total score and the single scale scores ( at optimum level); e) Validation by external criteria of work related stress identified in the presence of personal violence episodes experienced by a group of health workers with different professional profiles and from two different hospitals in Rome. Our results show that the SPQR is a useful and sensitive tool for assessing the presence of emotional stress related problems identifiable in a work environment. The advantage of this questionnaire is that it allows for a multidimensional description of the different components of this problematic area besides its ability to quantify the overall stress level of those who have been administered the SPQR.
