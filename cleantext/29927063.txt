  Since 2011 , advanced practice physiotherapists ( APPs) have triaged the care of patients awaiting orthopaedic and rheumatology consultant/specialist doctor appointments in Ireland. APP services have evolved across the major hospitals ( n = 16) and , after 5 years , profiling and evaluation of APP services was warranted. The present study profiled the national musculoskeletal APP services , focusing on service , clinician and patient outcome factors. An online survey of physiotherapists in the allocated APP posts ( n = 25) explored: service organization; clinician profile and experience of the advanced role; and patient wait times and outcome measures. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse hospital- and clinician-specific data , and a content analysis was performed to explore APP experiences. A 68 % ( n = 17) response from 13 sites was achieved , whereby 20 whole-time APP posts existed in services led by 91 consultant doctors. Co-location of APP and consultant clinics at 11 sites facilitated joint medical-APP processes , with between-site differences in autonomy to screen referral letters , and arrange investigations , injections and surgery. Although 83 % had postgraduate qualifications , APPs also availed themselves of informal role-specific training. Positive APP experiences related to learning opportunities and clinical support networks but experiences were consultant dependent , with further service developments and formal training required to manage workloads. APPs reported reduced wait times and most commonly chose to capture function/disability in future evaluations. Variances existed in the organizational design and operating of APP services. Although highly experienced and qualified , APPs welcomed additional formal training and support , due to the complex , more medical nature of APP roles. Further formal evaluation , capturing patient outcomes , is proposed.
