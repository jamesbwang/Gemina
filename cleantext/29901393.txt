  A new energy decomposition analysis ( EDA) scheme based on valence bond ( VB) wave function , called VB-EDA , is presented. In VB-EDA , the total interaction energy is decomposed into frozen , charge transfer , polarization and dynamic correlation terms based on valence bond calculations. The frozen term is the energy variation of the unrelaxed VB wave function according to the change of an interaction distance. The charge transfer term is the contribution of the additional VB structures while the polarization term is due to the relaxation of VB orbitals. Dynamic correlation term is computed by post-VBSCF methods. Different from other existing VB based EDA schemes , which were used to analyze noncovalent interactions for some specific complexes , the newly developed VB-EDA is designed for the general use. Using VB-EDA , the bonding nature of cation-π interactions in a series of cation-π complexes ( cations = Li
