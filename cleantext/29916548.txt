  The three genes encoding small non‑coding microRNA ( miR) 34a , MIR34b and MIR34c act as tumor‑suppressor genes. Their aberrant expressions regulated by DNA methylation have been frequently found in various types of cancer. In the present study , the DNA promoter methylation profiles of the MIR34 gene family were analyzed using the methylation specific polymerase chain reaction in order to clarify their association with breast and lung cancer , non‑cancerous or normal adjacent tissues. The methylation frequency of MIR34a was significantly higher in breast cancer ( 49.37 %) compared with normal adjacent tissues ( 30.38 %). The methylation frequency of MIR34b/c was 59.49 and 62.03 % in breast cancer and normal adjacent tissues , respectively. MIR34a methylation showed a significant concordance with that of MIR34b/c only in breast cancer tissue. MIR34a methylation was significantly associated with cancer and the invasive ductal carcinoma type of breast cancer ( P = 0.015 and P = 0.02 , respectively). Methylation frequency of MIR34a and MIR34b/c was 48.42 and 56.84 % in lung cancer , and 47.22 and 51.39 % in pulmonary diseases , respectively. No significant association was observed between the methylation status of MIR34a and MIR34b/c , and the clinicopathological features of lung cancer or with those of non‑cancerous pulmonary diseases. Promoter methylation of MIR34a and MIR34b/c occurs frequently and concomitantly in breast and lung cancer , as well as in pulmonary diseases tissues , but not in breast normal tissues adjacent to tumor. These results of the present study emphasize the involvement of MIR34 methylation in human<disease> diseases<disease> , including cancer. Furthermore , MIR34a methylation may be a promising marker for a subtype of breast cancer.
