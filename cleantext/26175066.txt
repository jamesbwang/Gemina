  A 5-year-old neutered male Labrador retriever dog with a 3-year history of intermittent hemorrhage<symptom> from the right metacarpal pad was evaluated. A small region of hyperattenuation of the metacarpal pad was evident on computed tomographic angiography. Excisional biopsy of the location of the purported hemorrhage<symptom> revealed a micro-arteriovenous malformation on histologic examination.
