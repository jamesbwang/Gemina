  Purinergic ionotropic P2X receptors ( P2RX) are involved in normal and pathological pain transmission. Among them , P2X4 are expressed in dorsal root ganglion and in the spinal cord. Their activation during nerve injury or chronic peripheral inflammation<symptom> modifies pain sensitivity that leads to the phenomenon of allodynia and hyperalgesia. We study here , in vivo , the role of P2X4 on the excitability of dorsal horn neurons ( DHNs) in naive or pathological context. We recorded DHNs in vivo in anesthetized wild-type or P2RX4 Our results indicate that P2X4 alter neuronal excitability only in the pathological context of peripheral inflammation<symptom>. Consequently , excitability of DHNs from inflamed P2RX4 These results confirm the prominent role of P2X4 in inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> context and demonstrate that P2X4 are also involved in the hyperexcitability of DHNs.
