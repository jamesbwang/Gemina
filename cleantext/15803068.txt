  The aim of this study was to estimate the learning curve needed for correct placement of minimally invasive percutaneous pedicle screws ( PPS). PPS are the most common system used for instrumentation of spinal lesions<symptom> that require stabilization. We retrospectively assessed the insertion of 422 PPS ( T5 to S1) in 75 patients operated between 2013-2016 under two-dimensional fluoroscopic guidance. The surgeon 1 always placed the PPS on the right side and the surgeon 2 on the left side. Screw positioning and pedicle rupture was determined with the Gertzbein tomographic classification. We compared the accuracy of PPS placement in our series with a reference rupture rate of 8.08 % , value obtained from a meta-analysis. Of the 422 TTP , 395 were inserted into the pedicle without violation of its cortical wall ( Grade 1 = 93.6 %) , 27 ( 6.4 %) disrupted the pedicle , of which 3.8 % were Grade 2 , 1.65 % Grade 3 and only 0.9 % Grade 4. The Surgeon 1 , presented an overall break rate of 6.6 % reaching standard values of accuracy by placing 74 PPS , Surgeon 2 showed a disruption rate of 6.1 % , reaching baseline values at 64 PPS; the difference between them was not statistically significant ( In our series , it was necessary to place approximately 70 PPS to achieve intrapedicular accuracy comparable to results reported by experienced surgeons in this minimally invasive technique.
