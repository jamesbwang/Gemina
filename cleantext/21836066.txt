  Cardiokines play an essential role in maintaining normal cardiac functions and responding to acute myocardial injury. Studies have demonstrated the heart itself is a significant source of C1q/TNF-related protein 9 ( CTRP9). However , the biological role of cardiac-derived CTRP9 remains unclear. We hypothesize cardiac-derived CTRP9 responds to acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion ( MI/R) injury as a cardiokine. We explored the role of cardiac-derived CTRP9 in MI/R injury via genetic manipulation and a CTRP9-knockout ( CTRP9-KO) animal model. Inhibition of cardiac CTRP9 exacerbated , whereas its overexpression ameliorated , left ventricular dysfunction and myocardial apoptosis. Endothelial CTRP9 expression was unchanged while cardiomyocyte CTRP9 levels decreased after simulated ischemia/ ` reperfusion ( SI/R) in vitro. Cardiomyocyte CTRP9 overexpression inhibited SI/R-induced apoptosis , an effect abrogated by CTRP9 antibody. Mechanistically , cardiac-derived CTRP9 activated anti-apoptotic signaling pathways and inhibited endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress-related apoptosis in MI/R injury. Notably , CTRP9 interacted with the ER molecular chaperone calreticulin ( CRT) located on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. The CTRP9-CRT interaction activated the protein kinase A-cAMP response element binding protein ( PKA-CREB) signaling pathway , blocked by functional neutralization of the autocrine CTRP9. Inhibition of either CRT or PKA blunted cardiac-derived CTRP9 's anti-apoptotic actions against MI/R injury. We further confirmed these findings in CTRP9-KO rats. Together , these results demonstrate that autocrine CTRP9 of cardiomyocyte origin protects against MI/R injury via CRT association , activation of the PKA-CREB pathway , ultimately inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
