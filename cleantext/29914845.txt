  Oncogenic high-risk human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) infections cause a substantial number of genital and non-genital cancers worldwide. Approximately 70 % of all cervical cancers are caused by the high-risk HPV16 and 18 types. The remaining 30 % can be attributed to twelve other high-risk HPV-types. Highly efficacious 2-valent , 4-valent and 9-valent L1 protein based prophylactic HPV<pathogen> vaccines are available however with limited cross-protection. To further increase the coverage , development of a multivalent cross-protective HPV<pathogen> vaccine is currently focused on the conserved N-terminus of HPV<pathogen> 's L2 protein. We have developed a vaccine candidate based on the rare human<pathogen> adenovirus<pathogen> type 35 ( HAdV35) vector that displays a concatemer of L2 protein epitopes from four different HPV-types via protein IX ( pIX). A mix of two heterologous HAdV35 pIX-L2 display vectors present highly conserved linear epitopes of nine HPV-types. Each HAdV35 pIX-L2 display vector exhibits a good manufacturability profile. HAdV35 pIX-L2 display vaccine vectors were immunogenic and induced neutralizing antibodies against HPV-types included in the vaccine and cross-neutralizing antibodies against distant a HPV-type not included in the vaccine in mice. The HAdV35 pIX-L2 display vectors offer an opportunity for a multivalent HAdV-based prophylactic HPV<pathogen> vaccine.
