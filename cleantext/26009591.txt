  Fruit ripening is a complex biological process affecting fruit quality. In tomato the fruit ripening process is delicately regulated by transcription factors ( TFs). Among these , the TOMATO AGAMOUS-LIKE 1 ( TAGL1) gene plays an important role in both the development and ripening of fruit. In this study , the TAGL1 gene was successfully silenced by virus-induced gene silencing technology ( VIGS) , and the global gene expression and metabolites profiles of TAGL1-silenced fruits were analyzed by RNA-sequence analysis ( RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS). The TAGL1-silenced fruits phenotypically displayed an orange pericarp , which was in accordance with the results expected from the down-regulation of genes associated with carotenoid synthesis. Levels of several amino acids and organic acids were lower in the TAGL1-silenced fruits than in the wild-type fruits , whereas , Î±-tomatine content was greatly increased ( more than 10-fold) in the TAGL1-silenced fruits compared to wild-type fruits. The findings of this study showed that TAGL1 not only regulates the ripening of tomato fruits , but also affects the synthesis and levels of nutrients in the fruit.
