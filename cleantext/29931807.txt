  In this work we seek clues to select the appropriate dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction mode for extracting three categories of compounds. For this purpose , three common dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction modes were compared under optimized conditions. Traditional dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction , in situ ionic liquid dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction , and conventional ionic liquid dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction using chloroform , 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate , and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate as the extraction solvent , respectively , were considered in this work. Phenolic , neutral aromatic , and amino compounds ( each category included six members) were studied as analytes. The analytes in the extracts were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. For the analytes with polar functionalities , the in situ ionic liquid dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction mode mostly led to better results. In contrast , for neutral hydrocarbons without polar functionalities , traditional dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction using chloroform produced better results. In this case , where dispersion forces were the dominant interactions in the extraction , the refractive index of solvent and analyte predicted the extraction performance better than the octanol/water partition coefficient. It was also revealed that none of the methods were successful in extracting hydrophilic analytes ( compounds with the log octanol/water partition coefficient < 2). The results of this study could be helpful in selecting a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction mode for the extraction of various groups of compounds.
