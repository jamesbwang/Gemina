  The introduction of solid-phase peptide synthesis in the 1960s improved the chemical synthesis of both the A- and B-chains of insulin and insulin analogs. However , the subsequent elaboration of the synthetic peptides to generate active hormones continues to be difficult and complex due in part to the hydrophobicity of the A-chain. Over the past decade , several groups have developed different methods to enhance A-chain solubility. Two of the most popular methods are use of isoacyl dipeptides , and the attachment of an A-chain C-terminal pentalysine tag with a base-labile 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid linker. These methods have proven effective but can be limited in scope depending on the peptide sequence of a specific insulin. Herein we describe an auxiliary approach to enhance the solubility of insulin-based peptides by incorporating a tri-lysine tag attached to a cleavable Fmoc-Ddae-OH linker. Incorporation of this linker , or `` helping hand '' , on the N-terminus greatly improved the solubility of chicken insulin A-chain , which is analogous to human insulin , and allowed for coupling of the insulin A- and B-chain via directed disulfide bond formation. After formation of the insulin heterodimer , the linker and tag could be easily removed using a hydrazine buffer ( pH 7.5) to obtain an overall 12.6 % yield based on A-chain. This strategy offers an efficient method to enhance the solubility of hydrophobic insulin-based peptides as well as other traditionally difficult peptides.
