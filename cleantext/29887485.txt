  Low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia ( GTN) patients ( FIGO score â‰¤ 6) are generally treated with single agent chemotherapy ( methotrexate or dactinomycin) resulting in a 5-year mortality rate of 0.3 %. However , despite these encouraging survival rates , chemotherapy is associated with significant adverse events in most patients. Although it is generally accepted that patients who no longer wish to conceive may be treated by hysterectomy for a hydatidiform mole , the evidence to support this strategy in low-risk GTN patients is lacking. To describe the survival , efficacy , and tolerance associated with first-line hysterectomy in low-risk non-metastatic GTN patients. Seventy-four of 1072 low-risk GTN patients treated in the French Center underwent first-line hysterectomy. Patients data with successful first-line hysterectomy were retrospectively compared to those requiring further salvage chemotherapy. First-line hysterectomy was followed by hCG normalization in 61 patients ( 82.4 % , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 71.8-90.3) without any further salvage chemotherapy , whereas 13 patients required salvage chemotherapy. After multivariate analysis , a FIGO score of 5-6 ( exact OR 8.961 , 95 % CI 1.60-64.96) , and the presence of choriocarcinoma ( exact OR 14.295 , 95 % CI 1.78-138.13) were associated with the risk of requiring salvage chemotherapy. Hysterectomy as a first-line treatment is effective without salvage chemotherapy in 82.4 % of women with low-risk non-metastatic GTN and can be presented as an alternative to single-agent chemotherapy when childbearing considerations have been fulfilled. In young patients , this therapeutic option should not be considered because single-agent chemotherapies are curative in nearly 100 % of patients while maintaining fertility.
