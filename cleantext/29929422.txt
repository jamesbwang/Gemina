  Deregulation of metabolism during melanoma progression is tightly associated with the genetic and epigenetic alterations of metabolic regulators. Metformin , a macroautophagy/autophagy inducer , has beneficial effects of preventing and treating multiple cancers with an unclear mechanism. Enhanced pseudokinase TRIB3 was reported to link metabolic stressors to melanoma promotion by inhibiting autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome degradation systems. Here , we discuss our recent findings regarding how metformin reduces TRIB3 expression to restore autophagic flux and suppress melanoma progression in non-diabetic and diabetic mice. We found that overexpression of TRIB3 reverses the metformin-activated autophagic flux , clearance of accumulated tumor-promoting factors and inhibition of tumor progression. Mechanistically , TRIB3 interacts with KAT5 ( lysine acetyltransferase 5) and promotes the physical association of KAT5 and SMAD3 , which enhances SMAD3 K333 acetylation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner , sustains SMAD3 transcriptional activity and induces TRIB3 expression. Metformin inhibits SMAD3 phosphorylation and impedes the KAT5-SMAD3 interaction , which attenuates the KAT5-mediated K333 acetylation of SMAD3 to suppress SMAD3 transcriptional activity and TRIB3 expression. Our finding defines a molecular mechanism by which metformin targets TRIB3 expression to induce autophagy and protect against melanoma progression.
