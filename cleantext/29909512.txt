  Endoscopic bariatric therapies ( EBTs) are promising alternatives to conventional surgery for obesity. The aim of this study is to compare efficacy and safety through a systematic review and meta-analysis of the endoscopic gastroplasty techniques versus conservative treatment. We searched MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane CENTRAL , Lilacs/Bireme. Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) enrolling obese patients comparing endoscopic gastroplasty to sham or diet/exercise were considered eligible. Among 6014 records , three RCTs were selected for meta-analysis. The total sample was 459 patients ( 312 EBTs vs 147 control). Mean total body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> in the intervention group ( IG) was 4.8 % higher than the control group ( CG) at 12 months ( p = 0.01). The IG responder rate was 44.31 % at 12 months. Therefore , the endoscopic gastroplasty is more effective than conservative therapies but do not achieve FDA thresholds.
