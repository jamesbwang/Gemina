  In this work , 3D CdIn2S4 nano-octahedron/2D ZnO nanosheet heterojunctions ( CIS/ZO-x) were fabricated for the first time via a facile and green impregnation-hydrothermal method , where three-dimensional ( 3D) CdIn2S4 nano-octahedra densely anchor onto both sides of 2D ZnO nanosheets to form an embedded nanostructure with intimate interfacial contacts. Various characterization techniques were adopted to measure the morphologies , structures and optical properties of the as-prepared CIS/ZO-x heterojunctions in detail. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared CIS/ZO-x was evaluated via the photodegradation of tetracycline hydrochloride ( TCH) under visible light irradiation , and the result shows that the hybridization of ZnO nanosheets with CdIn2S4 nano-octahedra significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity of heterojunctions. The highly stable and reusable sample CIS/ZO -2 possesses the highest photocatalytic activity ( 94.04 %) , and its rate constant ( k = 0.06357 min-1) is about 4.96 and 22.31 times as high as those of pure CdIn2S4 and ZnO. Interestingly , the removal efficiency of TCH and the rate constant are also much higher than those of numerous previously reported composite photocatalysts. The synergistic effect and the unique 3D/2D hybrid structure with intimate interfacial contacts are primarily responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity. A possible photocatalytic mechanism for the TCH photodegradation over the CIS/ZO sample is also proposed. This work provides a novel 3D/2D composite photocatalyst for the efficient removal of antibiotic pollutants and will be helpful for designing other 3D/2D heterojunctions.
