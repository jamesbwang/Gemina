  A diverse array of biological processes are under circadian controls. In mouse skin , ultraviolet ray ( UVR)- induced apoptosis and DNA damage responses are time-of-day dependent , which are controlled by core clock proteins. This study investigates the roles of clock proteins in regulating UVB responses in human keratinocytes ( HKCs). We found that the messenger RNA expression of brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 ( BMAL1) and circadian locomotor output cycles kaput ( CLOCK) genes is altered by low doses ( 5 mJ/cm
