  Dispersin B ( DspB) has shown a great potential for the hydrolysis of polymeric β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine ( PNAG) to disperse the biofilms formed by various bacteria but with no killing activity. Here we have investigated whether a silver-binding peptide ( AgBP) fused to DspB can induce the in situ formation of silver nanoparticles ( AgNP) and conjugated to the structure of DspB so that the bacteria cells released from the dispersed biofilm will be killed by the conjugated AgNP. However , the desired conjugate could be obtained because of the silver ions itself was found to precipitate DspB. But , the fusion of AgBP2 to DspB ( AgBP2-DspB) could generate at least 2 fold higher activity against soluble substrate 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide ( NP-GlcNAc). By applying to a preformed Staphylococcus<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen> biofilm , AgBP2-DspB could clear 69 % of the biofilm while only 37 % could be cleared by DspB as observed by fluorescent microscope. As measured by crystal violet staining , biofilm could be eradicated to the same extent by loading AgBP2-DspB activity level approximately 20 fold lower than that of DspB. The biofilm formation could be prevented on a AgBP2-DspB immobilized surface as observed by confocal laser microscope.
