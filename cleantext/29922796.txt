  Phosphine oxidation by MesCNO is rapid; however , an FLP strategy intercepts the 1,3 addition products including ( MesC ( R3P) NOB ( C6F5) 3) ( R = Ph 1 , p-tol 2) , ( MesC ( Mes2PH) NOB ( C6F5) 3) 3 ( MesC ( NOB ( C6F5) 3) Ph2P) 2 ( CH2) n ( n = 2: 4 , 3: 5) and ( MesC ( Ph3P) NOB ( C6F4H) 3) 6. These species are shown to react with tBuOK or ( Bu4N) F permitting the oxidation to proceed via a process involving borane dissociation. Similarly , the equilibrium established by 1 with B ( C6F4H) 3 and 6 with B ( C6F5) 3 provides experimental support for the `` Cummins mechanism '' for these phosphine oxidations.
