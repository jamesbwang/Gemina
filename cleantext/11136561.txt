  Recent studies have challenged radical procedures for less extensive surgery in selected patients with early-stage cervical cancer at low risk of parametrial invasion. Our objective was to identify a subgroup of patients at low risk of parametrial invasion among women having undergone surgical treatment. Data of 1447 patients with cervical cancer treated between 1996 and 2016 were extracted from maintained databases of 10 French University hospitals. Patients with early-stage ( IA2-IIA) disease treated by radical surgery including hysterectomy and trachelectomy , were selected for further analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival distribution. A Cox proportional hazards model including all the parameters statistically significant in univariate analysis , was used to account for the influence of multiple variables. Out of the 263 patients included for analysis , on final pathology analysis 28 ( 10.6 %) had parametrial invasion and 235 ( 89.4 %) did not. Factors significantly associated with parametrial invasion on multivariate analysis were: age > 65 years , tumor > 30 mm in diameter measured by MRI , lymphovascular space invasion ( LVSI) on pathologic analysis. Among the 235 patients with negative pelvic lymph nodes , parametrial disease was seen in only 7.6 % compared with 30.8 % of those with positive pelvic nodes ( p < 0.001). In a subgroup of patients presenting tumors < 30 mm , negative pelvic status and no LVSI , the risk of parametrial invasion fell to 0.6 % ( 1/173 patients). Our analysis suggests that there is a subgroup of patients at very low risk of parametrial invasion , potentially eligible for less radical procedures.
