  The immune system is highly dynamic and regulated by many baseline characteristic factors. As such , significant variability may exist among different patient groups suffering from the same autoimmune disease ( AD). However , contemporary research practices tend to take the reductionist aggregate approach: they do not segment AD patients before embarking on biomarker discovery. This approach has been productive: many novel AD biomarkers have recently been discovered. Yet , subsequent validation studies of these biomarkers tend to suffer from a lack of specificity , sensitivity , and reproducibility which hamper their translation for clinical use. To enhance reproducibility in validation studies , an optimal discovery-phase study design is paramount: one which takes into account different parameters affecting the immune system biology. In this systematic review , we highlight need for stratification in one such parameter , i.e. , sex stratification. We will first explore sex differences in immune system biology and AD prevalence , followed by reported sex-bias in the clinical phenotypes of two ADs-one which more commonly affects females: systemic lupus erythematosus , and one which more commonly affects males: ankylosing spondylitis. The practice of sex stratification in biomarker research may not only advance the discovery of sex-specific AD biomarkers but more importantly , promote reproducibility in subsequent validation studies , thus easing the translation of these novel biomarkers from bench to bedside to improve AD diagnosis. In addition , such practice will also promote deeper understanding for differential AD pathophysiology in males and females , which will be useful for the development of more effective interventions for each sex type.
