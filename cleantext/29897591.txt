  Non-invasive quantification of tree water potential is one of the grand challenges for assessing the fate of trees and forests in the coming decades. Tree water potential is a robust and direct indicator of tree water status and is preferably used to track how trees , forests and vegetation in general respond to changes in climate and drought. In this issue of Tree Physiology , Dietrich et al. ( 2018) predict the daily canopy water potential of mature temperate trees from tree water deficit derived from stem diameter variation measurements.
