  Cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs) interact closely with cancer cells , supporting their growth and invasion. To investigate the role of microRNA-21 ( miR-21) in lung adenocarcinoma , and especially in its CAF component , in situ hybridisation was applied to samples from 89 invasive lung adenocarcinoma cases. MiR-21 expression was observed in both cancer cells and CAFs. When the patients were stratified by expression , miR-21 levels in CAFs ( n = 9) , but not in cancer cells ( n = 21) , were inversely correlated with patient survival; patients with miR-21
