  Somatic complaints , often associated with concurrent and future internalizing symptoms and disorders in adult samples , were examined longitudinally from preschool to school age in a sample of children at an increased familial risk for psychopathology. The behavioral correlates and sex differences of somatic complaints and the persistence of these complaints across early childhood were examined. A longitudinal sample of 185 mothers completed a laboratory visit when children were preschool aged and an online follow-up when children were school aged. Mothers were assessed for psychopathology , and mothers and secondary caregivers reported on children 's somatic complaints , anxiety<symptom> , and depression<symptom> at both time points. A high rate of child 's somatic complaints was noted in this sample , with similar rates in males and females. Regression analyses revealed that somatic complaints at preschool predicted somatic complaints , anxiety<symptom> , and depression<symptom> at school age , and sex did not moderate these relationships. Overall , maternal psychopathology predicted somatic complaints , but findings were inconsistent across reporters , time points , and types of maternal psychopathology. Evidence for maternal reporting bias was mixed. The association between preschool-age somatic complaints and school-age internalizing symptoms suggests the potential utility of early detection and treatment of somatic complaints , particularly for young children at an increased familial risk for developing internalizing disorders. Pediatric primary care is an ideal setting for these early intervention efforts.
