  Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are first choice for treating anemia<symptom> in low-risk MDS. This double-blind , placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and safety of epoetin-α in IPSS low- or intermediate-1 risk ( i.e. , low-risk) MDS patients with Hb ≤ 10.0 g/dL , with no or moderate RBC transfusion dependence ( ≤ 4 RBC units/8 weeks). Patients were randomized , 2:1 , to receive epoetin-α 450 IU/kg/week or placebo for 24 weeks , followed by treatment extension in responders. The primary endpoint was erythroid response ( ER) through Week 24. Dose adjustments were driven by weekly Hb-levels and included increases , and dose reductions/discontinuation if Hb > 12 g/dL. An independent Response Review Committee ( RRC) blindly reviewed all responses , applying IWG-2006 criteria but also considering dose adjustments , drug interruptions and longer periods of observation.A total of 130 patients were randomized ( 85 to epoetin-α and 45 to placebo). The ER by IWG-2006 criteria was 31.8 % for epoetin-α vs 4.4 % for placebo ( p < 0.001); after RRC review , the ER was 45.9 vs 4.4 % ( p < 0.001) , respectively. Epoetin-α reduced RBC transfusions and increased the time-to-first-transfusion compared with placebo.Thus , epoetin-α significantly improved anemia<symptom> outcomes in low-risk MDS. IWG-2006 criteria for ER may require amendments to better apply to clinical studies.
