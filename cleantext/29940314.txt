  Primary ovarian insufficiency ( POI) in adolescents not due to cytotoxic therapy has not been well studied. Causes of POI have been described in adults , but adolescents may represent a unique subset necessitating a targeted approach to diagnosis , work-up and treatment. We sought to better characterize adolescent POI through a descriptive multicenter study. Case series of patients with POI. Six tertiary care institutions ParticipantsPatients presenting from 2007-2014 aged 13-21 years diagnosed with non-cytotoxic POI , exclusions gonadotoxic therapy , 46XY gonadal dysgenesis , lack of evidence of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism on chart review. Review and data extraction of records identified with ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Data were analyzed for signs and symptoms , workup , and treatments. Complete work-up was based on ACOG guidelines. Characteristics of patients with POI presenting with delayed puberty/primary amenorrhea vs secondary amenorrhea were compared. 135 records were identified. Those who had received cytotoxic therapy ( n = 52) , 46XY gonadal dysgenesis ( n = 7) , or on review did not have POI ( n = 19) were excluded. Of 57 remaining cases , 16 were 45X , 2 had galactosemia and 4 had X-chromosome abnormalities. Most did not undergo full etiologic evaluation. Girls diagnosed following primary amenorrhea/delayed puberty were less symptomatic and more likely to receive an estrogen patch than those diagnosed following secondary amenorrhea. Non-cytotoxic POI in adolescents is an uncommon condition with only 64 cases in 6 institutions over 7 years. These patients may not undergo complete etiological workup. Aside from 45X , the most common etiologies are X-chromosome abnormalities or galactosemia.
