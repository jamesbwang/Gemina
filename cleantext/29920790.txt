  Nature has developed high-performance materials and structures over millions of years of evolution and provides valuable sources of inspiration for the design of next-generation structural materials , given the variety of excellent mechanical , hydrodynamic , optical , and electrical properties. Biomimicry , by learning from nature 's concepts and design principles , is driving a paradigm shift in modern materials science and technology. However , the complicated structural architectures in nature far exceed the capability of traditional design and fabrication technologies , which hinders the progress of biomimetic study and its usage in engineering systems. Additive manufacturing ( three-dimensional ( 3D) printing) has created new opportunities for manipulating and mimicking the intrinsically multiscale , multimaterial , and multifunctional structures in nature. Here , an overview of recent developments in 3D printing of biomimetic reinforced mechanics , shape changing , and hydrodynamic structures , as well as optical and electrical devices is provided. The inspirations are from various creatures such as nacre , lobster claw , pine cone , flowers , octopus , butterfly wing , fly eye , etc. , and various 3D-printing technologies are discussed. Future opportunities for the development of biomimetic 3D-printing technology to fabricate next-generation functional materials and structures in mechanical , electrical , optical , and biomedical engineering are also outlined.
