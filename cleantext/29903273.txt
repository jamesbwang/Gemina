  To determine the optimal cut-off values of body fat percentage ( BF %) in Chinese adults. A total of 1022 adults aged 18-69 years in Liaoning , Henan and Hunan Province was enrolled in this study. Analyzed the changes of BF % in different percentiles of body mass index ( BMI) , waist circumference ( WC) , waist-to-height ratio ( WHtR) , waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR). BF % cut-off values were determined by receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve. In Chinese adults , the average of BF % was 22. 1 % in males and 33. 2 % in females. The obesity prevalence determined by BF % cut-off points ( recommended by WHO) was 31. 4 % in men and 39. 3 % in women. Taking hypertension as a dependent variable , ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal BF % cut-off value was 23. 2 % ( sensitivity: 0. 61 , specificity: 0. 61) in men and 36. 4 % ( sensitivity: 0. 48 , specificity: 0. 76) in women. In China , the optimal cut-off value of BF % in adult men is lower than the international standard , whereas the optimal cut-off value of BF % in adult women is higher than the international standard. It is of higher significance to make optimal BF % cut-off values for our own country.
