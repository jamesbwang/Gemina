  The main goal of the present study was to determine the influence of low and high doses of acrylamide on CART-like immunoreactivity within the ENS of the porcine small intestines. Investigation was performed on 15 sexually immature female pigs , divided into three groups: control group , where empty gelatin capsules were administered , and two experimental groups , where capsules containing low or high doses of acrylamide were given. After 28days of acrylamide exposure all animals were euthanized with a gradual overdose of anaesthetics. Immediately after euthanasia fragments of the duodenum , jejunum<symptom> and ileum were collected and fixed. Then , 14Î¼m-thick cryostat sections were processed for routine double-labelling immunofluorescence using primary antisera directed towards a pan neuronal marker- protein gene-product 9.5 ( PGP 9.5) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated peptide transcript ( CART). During the present investigation , CART-LI cell bodies were detected in all types of enteric plexuses of duodenum , jejunum<symptom> and ileum. Acrylamide intoxication resulted in a significant increase in expression of CART in the intramural neurons of the porcine small intestines , especially in myenteric plexuses. It may suggest participation of CART in neuronal protection and recovery processes within the gut. Moreover , results of the present study suggest that even low doses of acrylamide cause a significant response of ENS neurons.
