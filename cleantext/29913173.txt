  False-positive HIV<pathogen> screening tests in pregnancy may lead to unnecessary interventions in labor. In 2014 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new algorithm for HIV<pathogen> diagnosis using a fourth-generation screening test , which detects antibodies to HIV<pathogen> as well as p24 antigen and has a shorter window period compared with prior generations. A reactive screen requires a differentiation assay , and supplemental qualitative RNA testing is necessary for nonreactive differentiation assay. One screening test , the ARCHITECT Ag/Ab Combo assay , is described to have 100 % sensitivity and > 99 % specificity in nonpregnant populations; however , its clinical performance in pregnancy has not been well described. The objective of the study was to determine the performance of the ARCHITECT assay among pregnant women at a large county hospital and to assess whether the relative signal-to-cutoff ratio can be used to differentiate between false-positive vs confirmed HIV<pathogen> infections in women with a nonreactive differentiation assay. This is a retrospective review of fourth-generation HIV<pathogen> testing in pregnant women at Parkland Hospital between June 1 , 2015 , and Jan. 31 , 2017. We identified gravidas screened using the ARCHITECT Ag/Ab Combo assay ( index test) , with reflex to differentiation assay. Women with reactive ARCHITECT and nonreactive differentiation assay were evaluated with a qualitative RNA assay ( reference standard). We calculated sensitivity , specificity , predictive value , and false-positive rate of the ARCHITECT screening assay in our population and described characteristics of women with false-positive HIV<pathogen> testing vs confirmed infection. Among women with a nonreactive differentiation assay , we compared interventions among women with and without a qualitative RNA assay result available at delivery and examined relative signal-to-cutoff ratios of the ARCHITECT assay in women with false-positive vs confirmed HIV<pathogen> infection. A total of 21,163 pregnant women were screened using the ARCHITECT assay , and 190 tested positive. Of these , 33 of 190 ( 17 %) women had false-positive HIV<pathogen> screening tests ( 28 deliveries available for analysis) , and 157 of 190 ( 83 %) had confirmed HIV-1 infection ( 140 available for analysis). Diagnostic accuracy of the ARCHITECT HIV<pathogen> Ag/Ab Combo assay in our prenatal population ( with 95 % confidence interval) was as follows: sensitivity , 100 % ( 97.7-100 %); specificity , 99.8 % ( 99.8-99.9 %); positive likelihood ratio , 636 ( 453-895); negative likelihood ratio , 0.0 ( NA); positive predictive value , 83 % ( 77-88 %); and false positive rate , 0.16 % ( 0.11-0.22 %) , with a prevalence of 7 per 1000. Women with false-positive HIV<pathogen> testing were younger and more likely of Hispanic ethnicity. A qualitative RNA assay ( reference standard) was performed prenatally in 24 ( 86 %) and quantitative viral load in 22 ( 92 %). Interventions occurred more frequently in women without a qualitative RNA assay result available at delivery , including intrapartum zidovudine ( 75 % vs 4 % , P = .002) , breastfeeding delay ( 75 % vs 8 % , P = .001) , and neonatal zidovudine initiation ( 75 % vs 4 % , P = .002). The ARCHITECT signal-to-cutoff ratio was significantly lower for women with false-positive HIV<pathogen> tests compared with those with established HIV<pathogen> infection ( 1.89 ( 1.27 , 2.73) vs 533.65 ( 391.12 , 737.22) , respectively , P < .001). While the performance of the fourth-generation ARCHITECT HIV<pathogen> Ag/Ab Combo assay among pregnant women is comparable with that reported in nonpregnant populations , clinical implications of using a screening test with a positive predictive value of 83 % in pregnancy are significant. When the qualitative RNA assay result is unavailable , absence of risk factors in combination with an ARCHITECT HIV<pathogen> Ag/Ab assay S/Co ratio < 5 and nonreactive differentiation assay provide sufficient evidence to support deferral of unnecessary intrapartum interventions while awaiting qualitative RNA results.
