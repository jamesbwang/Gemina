  A decision tree was constructed to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER) of grafting techniques used to prevent Frey Syndrome<disease>. The authors performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate what the probability of preventing Frey Syndrome<disease> would have to be and maximum costs associated with using grafting techniques to warrant their use as more `` cost-effective '' choice than using neither. Decision pathways utilized were uses of ( 1) free fat graft ( FFG) , ( 2) acellular dermis , and ( 3) no grafting. The probability of developing Frey syndrome<disease> and costs were extracted from previous studies to construct the decision tree. The primary effectiveness was the ICER of FFG or acellular dermis to prevent Frey syndrome<disease>. The initial outcomes included preventing Frey syndrome<disease> ( effectiveness = 1) or developing Frey syndrome<disease> ( effectiveness = 0). Compared with not using a graft , the ICER of using FFG and acellular dermis were $ 10,628 and $ 50,813 , respectively. Frey syndrome<disease> was found in 2.6 % of patients postoperatively in FFG group , 9.8 % of patients in acellular dermis group , and 30.7 % of patients who did not have a graft. The ICER shows absolute dominance of FFG with lower cost and high effectiveness over acellular dermis. This economic evaluation strongly supports the use of FFG over acellular dermis as cost-effective approach for prevention of postparotidectomy Frey
