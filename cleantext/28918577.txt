  To identify the impact of Lipocalin-2 ( LCN2) gene polymorphisms on breast cancer patients in western Saudi Arabia. It is a case control study in which blood samples of participants from Medical Reference Clinics and King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia have been taken between 2014 and 2016. This study recruited 128 participants ( 50 % control , 50 % patients) and used Tetra-Primer amplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction method for the detection of missense SNP ( rs11556770). The study measured LCN2 plasma protein expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Results: The results have shown that 100 % of the genotypes were normal allele ( G/G). In contrast , the plasma level of LCN2 was considerably elevated among patients as compared to control ( p = 0.001) , and higher in invasive ductal carcinoma patients ( p = 0.001). The LCN2 protein expression in plasma level was significantly elevated among patients , particularly who demonstrated invasive ductal carcinoma. Conclusion: There is no significant relationship between breast cancer patients and LCN2 gene polymorphisms ( rs11556770).
