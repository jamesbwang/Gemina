  Twisting linear acenes out of planarity affects their electronic and optical properties , and induces chirality. However , it is difficult to isolate the effect of twisting from the substituent effect. Moreover , many twistacenes ( twisted acenes) readily racemize in solution. Here , we introduce a series of twistacenes having an anthracene backbone diagonally tethered by an n-alkyl bridge , which induces a twist of various angles. This allows us to systematically monitor the effect of twisting on electronic and optical properties. We find that absorption is bathochromically shifted with increasing twist , while fluorescence quantum efficiency drops dramatically. The tethered twistacenes were isolated to their enantiomerically pure form , displaying strong chiroptical properties and anisotropy factor ( g-value). No racemization was observed even upon prolonged heating , rendering these tethered twistacenes suitable as enantiopure helical building units for Ï€-conjugated backbones.
