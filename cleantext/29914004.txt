  Circular RNAs ( circRNAs) play an important role in pathogenesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). However , circRNA expression profiles in hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> Virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>)- related HCC remain to be studied. Total 13 HBV-related HCC patients were enrolled for study. Three HCC and 3 paired adjacent non-tumorous ( NT) tissues from 3 patients were performed for microarray. Ten pairs of HCC tissues were used to verify the identified up-regulated and down-regulated circRNAs obtained from the microarray data by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR ( qRT-PCR). Total RNA was isolated and treated with Rnase R to remove linear RNA , then hybridized to the array to screen for circRNAs. Bioinformatics analyses including clustering , differential expression , annotation of circRNA/microRNA ( miRNA) interactions , Go analysis and KEGG pathway analysis , were performed. Based on the microarray data , we found significantly up-regulation of 24 circRNAs and down-regulation of 23 circRNAs in the HCC samples compared to NT samples ( fold change â©¾ 2.0 and P < 0.05). Of them , 6 candidate circRNAs ( hsa_circRNA_102814 , 100381 , 103489 , 101764 , 100327 , and 103361) were verified by qRT-PCR. Of them , hsa_circRNA 100381 , 103489 up-regulation and 101764 down-regulation were found to be significantly different in the 10 validation HCC tissue. Clusters of circRNAs were aberrantly expressed in HCC compared with NT samples. CircRNA_101764 was the largest nodes in circRNA/microRNA co-expression network , especially co-expression with hsa-miR-181 family , which plays an important role in cell network. Annotation of circRNA/miRNA interactions indicated that the biological effects of circRNA may be achieved by binding of miRNAs. GO analysis revealed that numerous target genes were involved in the biological processes , cellular component and molecular function. There was nearly 30 target genes enrichment on KEGG pathways analysis , PI3K-Akt signaling pathway which the most number of genes involved. In this study , we comprehensively explored the expression of differentially expressed circRNAs in HBV-related HCC , and our results indicate that circRNA_101764 may play an important role in the development of HCC.
