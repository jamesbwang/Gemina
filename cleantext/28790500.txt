  Today & rsquo; s high-resolution mass spectrometers ( HRMS) allow bioanalysts to perform untargeted/global determinations that can reveal unexpected compounds or concentrations in a patient & rsquo; s sample. This could be performed for preliminary diagnosis attempts when usual diagnostic processes and targeted determinations fail. We have evaluated an untargeted diagnostic screening ( UDS) procedure. UDS is a metabolome analysis that compares one sample ( e.g. , a patient) with control samples ( a healthy population). Using liquid chromatography ( LC)- HRMS full-scan analysis of human serum extracts and unsupervised data treatment , we have compared individual samples that were spiked with one xenobiotic or a higher level of one endogenous compound with control samples. After the use of different filters that drastically reduced the number of metabolites detected , the spiked compound was eventually revealed in each test sample and ranked. The proposed UDS procedure appears feasible and reliable to reveal unexpected xenobiotics ( toxicology) or higher concentrations of endogenous metabolites. HRMS-based untargeted approaches could be useful as preliminary diagnostic screening when canonical processes do not reveal disease etiology nor establish a clear diagnosis and could reduce misdiagnosis. On the other hand , the risk of overdiagnosis of this approach should be reduced with mandatory biomedical interpretation of the patient & rsquo; s UDS results and with confirmatory targeted and quantitative determinations.
