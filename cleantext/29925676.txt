  Allogeneic organ transplants are rejected by the recipient immune system within several days or weeks. However , the rejection process of allogeneic T ( allo-T) cells is poorly understood. In this study , using fluorescence-based monitoring and two-photon live imaging in mouse adoptive transfer system , we visualized the fate of allo-T cells in the in vivo environment and showed rapid elimination in secondary lymphoid organs ( SLOs). Although i.v. transferred allo-T cells efficiently entered host SLOs , including lymph nodes and the spleen , âˆ¼ 70 % of the cells had disappeared within 24 h. At early time points , allo-T cells robustly migrated in the T cell area , whereas after 8 h , the numbers of arrested cells and cell fragments were dramatically elevated. Apoptotic breakdown of allo-T cells released a large amount of cell debris , which was efficiently phagocytosed and cleared by CD8
