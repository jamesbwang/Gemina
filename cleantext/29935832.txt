  Chitosan is a biopolymer derived from chitin deacetylation , present in the exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects. Chitosan has been evaluated as rumen modulator and silage additive due to its antimicrobial properties. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of both chitosan and a bacterial additive on microbiological quality , chemical composition , nutrient in vitro degradation , fermentative profile , and total losses of whole-soybean plant silage ( SS) harvested at R6 stage. Four treatments in a factorial arrangement were randomly assigned to 40 experimental minisilos as no additives ( CON) , 8 g/t fresh forage of microbial inoculant ( INO; Kera SIL , Kera Nutrição Animal , Bento Gonçalves , Brazil); 5 g/kg of fresh forage chitosan ( CHI); and CHI + INO. Microbial inoculant was composed of Lactobacillus<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> ( 4.0 × 10
