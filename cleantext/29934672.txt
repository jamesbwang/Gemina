  Chalcones containing tertiary amine side-chains have potent activity as acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) inhibitors. However , the effects of the location of the tertiary amine groups as well as of other groups on AChE and butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE) activity have not been reported. Here , we report the synthesis and testing of 36 new coumarin-chalcone hybrids ( 5d-7j , 9d-11f , 12k-13m) against AChE and BChE. The nature and position of the chalcone substituents had major effects on inhibitory activity as well as selectivity for AChE over BChE. Compounds with para-substituted chalcone fragments in which the substituents were choline-like had potent activity against AChE and poor activity against BChE , while ortho-substituted analogs exhibited an opposite effect. Replacement of the terminal amine groups by amide , alkyl or alkenyl groups abrogated activity. Compound 5e showed potent inhibitory activity ( Formula: see text)) and good selectivity for AChE over BChE ( ratio 27.4) , and a kinetic study showed that 5e exhibited mixed-type inhibition against AChE. Computational docking results indicate that 5e binds to Trp 279 , Tyr334 and Trp 84 in AChE , but only to Trp 82 in BChE. Overall , the results show that coumarin-chalcone hybrids with choline-like side-chains have promising activity and selectivity against AChE and be promising therapeutic leads for Alzheimer 's disease.
