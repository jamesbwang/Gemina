  Spindlactone A ( SPL-A) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of TACC3 that selectively inhibits the nucleation of centrosome microtubules and induces mitotic arrest in ovarian cancer cells. SPL-A is derived from dicoumarol which inhibits the activity of NAD ( P) H dehydrogenase quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( NQO1). This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which SPL-A enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in endometrial carcinoma cells. Endometrial carcinoma cells were treated with SPL-A and/or TRAIL , and the apoptosis and protein expression in the treated cells were examined. Combined treatment with SPL-A and TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis in various human endometrial carcinoma cells , but not in normal human endometrial stromal cells and endometrial epithelial cells. Notably , both NQO1 inhibitor ES936 and NQO1 siRNA enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis of endometrial carcinoma cells. Furthermore , SPL-A downregulated the expression of c-FLIP , Bcl-2 , Bcl-xl , and Mcl-1 , while increasing p53 expression. In particular , luciferase assay showed that SPL-A inhibited Bcl-2 promoter activity , and p53 inhibitor PFT-Î± could reverse the effect of SPL-A on Bcl-2 expression. Moreover , Bcl-2 overexpression inhibited the apoptosis induced by SPL-A and TRAIL. Taken together , our results suggest that SPL-A sensitizes endometrial cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via the regulation of apoptosis-related proteins and the inhibition of NQO1 activity.
