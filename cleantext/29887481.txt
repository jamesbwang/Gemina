  Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AFib) is associated with adverse outcome in critical illness , but whether this effect is independent from other risk factors remains uncertain. New-onset AFib during critical illness may be independently associated with increased in-hospital and long-term risk of death. FROG-ICU was a prospective , observational , multi-centre cohort study designed to investigate the outcome of critically ill patients. Inclusion criteria were invasive mechanical ventilation and/or treatment with a positive inotropic agent for > 24 h. Heart<symptom> rhythm<symptom> was assessed at inclusion and during ICU stay with digital ECG recordings. Among patients who had AFib during ICU stay , new-onset and recurrent AFib were diagnosed in patients without and with previous history of AFib , respectively. Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality; secondary endpoint was 1-year mortality among ICU survivors. The study included 1841 critically ill patients. During ICU stay , AFib occurred in 343 patients ( 19 %). New-onset AFib ( n = 212) had higher in-hospital mortality compared to no AFib ( 47 vs. 23 % , P < 0.001) or recurrent AFib ( 34 % , P = 0.032). New-onset AFib showed increased risk of in-hospital death after multivariable adjustment compared to no AFib ( OR 1.6 , P = 0.003) or recurrent AFib ( OR 1.8 , P = 0.02). Among the 1464 ICU-survivors , new-onset AFib during ICU stay showed higher post-ICU risk of death compared to no AFib ( HR 2.2 , P < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment , new-onset AFib showed higher post-ICU risk of death compared to no AFib ( HR 1.6 , P = 0.03). New-onset AFib is independently associated with in-hospital and post-ICU risk of death in critically ill patients.
