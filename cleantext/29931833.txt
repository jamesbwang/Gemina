  Molluscs<disease> are extremely diverse invertebrate animals with a rich fossil record , highly divergent life cycles , and considerable economical and ecological importance. Key representatives include worm-like aplacophorans , armoured groups ( e.g. polyplacophorans , gastropods , bivalves) and the highly complex cephalopods. Molluscan origins and evolution of their different phenotypes have largely remained unresolved , but significant progress has been made over recent years. Phylogenomic studies revealed a dichotomy of the phylum , resulting in Aculifera ( shell-less aplacophorans and multi-shelled polyplacophorans) and Conchifera ( all other , primarily uni-shelled groups). This challenged traditional hypotheses that proposed that molluscs<disease> gradually evolved complex phenotypes from simple , worm-like animals , a view that is corroborated by developmental studies that showed that aplacophorans are secondarily simplified. Gene expression data indicate that key regulators involved in anterior-posterior patterning ( the homeobox-containing Hox genes) lost this function and were co-opted into the evolution of taxon-specific novelties in conchiferans. While the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP)/ decapentaplegic ( Dpp) signalling pathway , that mediates dorso-ventral axis formation , and molecular components that establish chirality appear to be more conserved between molluscs<disease> and other metazoans , variations from the common scheme occur within molluscan sublineages. The deviation of various molluscs<disease> from developmental pathways that otherwise appear widely conserved among metazoans provides novel hypotheses on molluscan evolution that can be tested with genome editing tools such as the CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein9) system.
