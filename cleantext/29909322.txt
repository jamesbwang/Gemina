  The potential catastrophic event of a landslide bringing contaminants to surface waters has been highlighted in public media , but there are still few scientific studies analyzing the risk of landslides with contaminated soil. The aim of this study is to present a method to estimate the risk of potential long-term ecological effects on water bodies due to contaminated soil released into a river through a landslide. The study constitutes further development of previous work focusing on the instantaneous ( short-term) release of contaminants and associated effects. Risk is here defined as the probability of surface water failing to comply with environmental quality standards ( EQS). The transport model formulation is kept simple enough to allow for a probabilistic analysis as a first assessment of the impact on the river water quality from a landslide runout deposit containing contaminated soil. The model is applied at a contaminated site located adjacent to the Göta Älv River that discharges into the Gothenburg estuary , in southwest Sweden. The results from the case study show that a contaminated runout deposit will likely cause contamination levels above EQSs in the near area for a long time and that it will take several years for the deposit to erode , with the greatest erosion at the beginning when water velocities are their highest above the deposit. A contaminated landslide runout deposit will thus act as a source of contamination to the downstream water system until all the contaminated deposit has been eroded away and the contaminants have been transported from the deposit to the river , and further to the river mouth<symptom>- diluted but not necessarily negligible. Therefore , it is important to prevent landslides of contaminated soil or waste , and if such events were to occur , to remove the contaminated runout deposit as soon as possible.
