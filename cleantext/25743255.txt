  Osteoarthritis ( OA) is a chronic joint disease and hard to cure at present. Accumulating evidence suggests long noncoding RNA-HOTAIR ( lncRNA-HOTAIR) plays important role in OA progression. However , the underlying molecular mechanism of HOTAIR in OA progression has not been well elucidated. In the present study , we identified that HOTAIR level was upregulated in OA cartilage tissues. High expression of HOTAIR was correlated with modified Mankin scale , extracellular matrix ( ECM) degradation and chondrocytes apoptosis. The expression of miR-17-5p was down-regulated , while alpha-1 , 2 fucosyltransferase 2 ( FUT2) was increased in OA progression. Luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation ( RIP) assays indicated that HOTAIR could directly bind to miR-17-5p and indirectly upregulate FUT2 level. Functional investigation revealed HOTAIR and FUT2 aggravated ECM degradation and chondrocytes apoptosis , and this effect could be reversed by miR-17-5p. Altered FUT2 modulated the activity of wnt/β-catenin pathway and HOTAIR/miR -17-5p also mediated wnt/β-catenin pathway through FUT2. Collectively , our findings indicated that HOTAIR/miR -17-5p/ FUT2 axis contributed to OA progression via wnt/β-catenin pathway , which might provide novel insights into the function of lncRNA-driven in OA.
