  The inner ear represents a promising system to develop cell-based therapies from human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs). In the developing ear , Notch signaling plays multiple roles in otic region specification and for cell fate determination. Optimizing hiPSC induction for the generation of appropriate numbers of otic progenitors and derivatives , such as hair cells , may provide an unlimited supply of cells for research and cell-based therapy. In this study , we used monolayer cultures , otic-inducing agents , Notch modulation , and marker expression to track early and otic sensory lineages during hiPSC differentiation. Otic/placodal progenitors were derived from hiPSC cultures in medium supplemented with FGF3/FGF10 for 13 days. These progenitor cells were then treated for 7 days with retinoic acid ( RA) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF) or a Notch inhibitor. The differentiated cultures were analyzed in parallel by qPCR and immunocytochemistry. After the 13 day induction , hiPSC-derived cells displayed an upregulated expression of a panel of otic/placodal markers. Strikingly , a subset of these induced progenitor cells displayed key-otic sensory markers , the percentage of which was increased in cultures under Notch inhibition as compared to RA/EGF-treated cultures. Our results show that modulating Notch pathway during in vitro differentiation of hiPSC-derived otic/placodal progenitors is a valuable strategy to promote the expression of human otic sensory lineage genes.
