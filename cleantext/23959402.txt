  Higher red cell distribution width ( RDW) has been reported to predict mortality among patients with various diseases , including chronic kidney disease ( CKD). However , whether RDW is associated with renal outcome remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between RDW and renal outcome in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD ( NDD-CKD). This prospective , observational study of patients with CKD was conducted at a single nephrology department. First , we performed regression analyses for the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) during the first 3 months of observation to determine its short-term association with RDW. Next , we categorized baseline RDW into two groups by its median ( 13.5 %) and performed Cox regression analyses to investigate whether higher RDW was an independent predictor of renal outcomes defined as a composite of the initiation of dialysis and doubling of the serum creatinine concentration. Furthermore , we repeated the analyses to confirm whether the transition of the RDW category during the first 3 months would also predict renal outcomes. We enrolled 703 patients. Baseline RDW showed a non-linear association with the eGFR decline during the first 3 months , with a greater negative correlation at the lower end of the RDW distribution. Over a median follow-up of 1.8 years , 178 patients ( 25.3 %) reached the renal endpoint. Multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that patients with higher RDW had a higher risk of developing renal outcomes ( adjusted hazard ratio ( HR): 1.47 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.05-2.07) than did those with lower RDW. Furthermore , patients with sustained , higher RDW demonstrated a significantly higher risk than did those with consistently lower RDW ( adjusted HR: 1.65 , 95 % CI: 1.02-2.67). In conclusion , higher RDW was independently associated with worse renal outcome in patients with NDD-CKD. RDW could be an additional prognostic marker of the progression of CKD.
