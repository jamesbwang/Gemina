  One of the tasks of the forensic specialist is to attempt to determine the interval between fatal injuries and death , and to assess whether the victim could be physically active before death and , if so , to what extent. There is ongoing research aimed at the application of additional tests ( histological , immunohistochemical and others) to answer these questions. Unfortunately , currently used methods have numerous limitations and require further improvements. Moreover , they are not commonly employed in medicolegal practice in Poland. The greatest difficulty in assessing the time of survival and activity occurs when the period is relatively short ( seconds-minutes-hours). Therefore , in practice , injury examination is often the only tool to assess the interval between fatal injuries and death , and the possibility of physical activity during that time. The aim of the paper is review the literature on this topic with a focus on biological methods and attempt to find a correlation between the nature of injuries and survival time , and between the nature of injuries and the capability to be physically active. An analysis of available cases has shown that unfortunately , on account of numerous limitations , the approach with the exception of specific situations , allows determining at most an approximate time interval during which the victim could be alive and active.
