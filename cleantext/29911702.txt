  Properties related to transport such as self-diffusion coefficients are relevant to fuel cells , electrolysis cells , and chemical/gas sensors. Prediction of self-diffusion coefficients from first-principles involves precise determination of both enthalpy and entropy contributions for point defect formation and migration. We use first-principles density functional theory to estimate the self-diffusion coefficient for neutral O0i and doubly ionized Oi2- interstitial oxygen in rutile TiO2 and compare the results to prior isotope diffusion experiments. In addition to formation and migration energy , detailed estimates of formation and migration entropy incorporating both vibrational and ionization components are included. Distinct migration pathways , both based on an interstitialcy mechanism , are identified for O0i and Oi2-. These result in self-diffusion coefficients that differ by several orders of magnitude , sufficient to resolve the charge state of the diffusing species to be Oi2- in experiment. The main sources of error when comparing computed parameters to those obtained from experiment are considered , demonstrating that uncertainties due to computed defect formation and migration entropies are comparable in magnitude to those due to computed defect formation and migration energies. Even so , the composite uncertainty seems to limit the accuracy of first-principles calculations to within a factor of Â± 103 , demonstrating that direct connections between computation and experiment are now increasingly possible.
