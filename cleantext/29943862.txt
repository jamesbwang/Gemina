  Farmland abandonment is increasing worldwide. Concurrently , a concept that views this as an opportunity for biodiversity restoration ( ` rewilding ') is drawing attention. Because of a lack of data , however , it remains inconclusive whether farmland abandonment increases biodiversity in different farmland types and corresponding environments. Information is particularly scarce for Asia , home to one-third of identified biodiversity hotspots and where the dominant farmlands , i.e. , rice fields , are often viewed as substitutes for natural wetlands. Here we present the first meta-analysis of the impacts of rice-field abandonment on biodiversity , considering multi-scale factors such as taxon surveyed , landscape context , and climate. Species richness and abundance after abandonment decreased to 56-72 % of that before. This reduction is unlikely to recover , at least for plant species richness , even after 10-15 years. These results suggest that rewilding can not necessarily be achieved by rice-field abandonment. Moreover , there was a pronounced biodiversity decline under dry conditions ( e.g. , low precipitation) , especially for wetland species such as amphibians and fish. Our results suggest that the impacts of farmland abandonment can be predicted by considering biological features of organisms and their associations with human-modified environments.
