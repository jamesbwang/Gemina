  Selecting priority occupational carcinogens is important for cancer prevention efforts; however , standardized selection methods are not available. The objective of this paper was to describe the methods used by CAREX Canada in 2015 to establish priorities for preventing occupational cancer , with a focus on exposure estimation and descriptive profiles. Four criteria were used in an expert assessment process to guide carcinogen prioritization: ( 1) the likelihood of presence and/or use in Canadian workplaces; ( 2) toxicity of the substance ( strength of evidence for carcinogenicity and other health effects); ( 3) feasibility of producing a carcinogen profile and/or an occupational estimate; and ( 4) special interest from the public/scientific community. Carcinogens were ranked as high , medium or low priority based on specific conditions regarding these criteria , and stakeholder input was incorporated. Priorities were set separately for the creation of new carcinogen profiles and for new occupational exposure estimates. Overall , 246 agents were reviewed for inclusion in the occupational priorities list. For carcinogen profile generation , 103 were prioritized ( 11 high , 33 medium , and 59 low priority) , and 36 carcinogens were deemed priorities for occupational exposure estimation ( 13 high , 17 medium , and 6 low priority). Prioritizing and ranking occupational carcinogens is required for a variety of purposes , including research , resource allocation at different jurisdictional levels , calculations of occupational cancer burden , and planning of CAREX-type projects in different countries. This paper outlines how this process was achieved in Canada; this may provide a model for other countries and jurisdictions as a part of occupational cancer prevention efforts.
