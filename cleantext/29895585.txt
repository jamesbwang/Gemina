  Sudden cardiac arrest ( CA) often results in severe injury to the brain , and neuroprotection after CA has proved to be difficult to achieve. Herein , we sought to investigate the effects of metformin pretreatment on brain injury secondary to CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Rats were subjected to 9-minute asphyxial CA after receiving daily metformin treatment for 2 weeks. Survival rate , neurologic deficit scores , neuronal loss , AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) , and autophagy activation were assessed at indicated time points within the first 7 days after return of spontaneous circulation. Our results showed that metformin pretreatment elevated the 7-day survival rate from 55 % to 85 % and significantly reduced neurologic deficit scores. Moreover , metformin ameliorated CA-induced neuronal degeneration and glial activation in the hippocampal CA1 region , which was accompanied by augmented AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy activation in affected neuronal tissue. Inhibition of AMPK or autophagy with pharmacological inhibitors abolished metformin-afforded neuroprotection , and augmented autophagy induction by metformin treatment appeared downstream of AMPK activation. Taken together , our data demonstrate , for the first time , that metformin confers neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury after CA/cardiopulmonary resuscitation by augmenting AMPK-dependent autophagy activation.
