  Markers of celiac disease ( CeD) may be elevated in various conditions of intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> or autoimmune disease. Recent reports argue that intestinal infection may induce development of CeD in susceptible individuals. Serum anti-tissue transglutaminase ( tTG) and anti-endomysium antibodies ( EMA) have been proposed in previous reports to be helpful in differentiating between giardiasis and CeD. In this report , we describe eight cases with elevated CeD serological markers and pathological duodenal histology during , or shortly after , Giardia infection. We present follow-up clinical and serological findings to determine which of these that were diagnosed with CeD. Serum levels of tTGand EMA did not discriminate well between patients where CeD was excluded , and those who were later diagnosed with CeD. The value of these serological CeD markers is discussed in relation to CeD diagnosis in cases with chronic or recent giardiasis.
