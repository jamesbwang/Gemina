  Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) is a devastating form of stroke , with a high rate of mortality and morbidity. Even with the best current medical or surgical interventions , outcomes remain poor. The location and initial hematoma volume are strong predictors of mortality. Hematoma expansion ( HE) is a further marker of poor prognosis that may be at least partly preventable. Several risk factors for HE have been identified , including baseline ICH volume , anticoagulation , and computed tomography angiography spot signs. Recent studies have shown the correlation of serum calcium ( Ca
