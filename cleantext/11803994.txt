  The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the dentin bond strength of etch-and-rinse and self-etch adhesives to primary teeth. In this study , PubMed , ISI ( all databases) , Scopus , and Cochrane Database were searched according to the selected keywords up to May 11 , 2016. The full texts of published articles that appeared to meet the primary criteria for inclusion in this study were obtained. Due to the variation in the methods used , the studies were divided into 2 groups: Group 1- studies that evaluated the micro-tensile bond strengths ( MTBSs) of two-step etch-and-rinse adhesives and two-step self-etch adhesives and Group 2- studies that evaluated the MTBSs of two-step etch-and-rinse adhesives and one-step self-etch adhesives. The initial search yielded 1447 publications. After a methodological assessment , 8 publications were selected. The results of this study showed that the MTBS of the etch-and-rinse adhesives and the two-step self-etch adhesives were similar ( P = 0.34) , and both were significantly higher than that of the one-step self-etch adhesive ( P = 0.001). This meta-analysis showed that the application of two-step self-etch adhesives performs well when used for primary dentin and can be used to save time in pediatric dentistry.
