  RGG/RG motifs are RNA binding segments found in many proteins that can partition into membraneless organelles. They occur in the context of low-complexity disordered regions and often in multiple copies. Although short RGG/RG-containing regions can sometimes form high-affinity interactions with RNA structures , multiple RGG/RG repeats are generally required for high-affinity binding , suggestive of the dynamic , multivalent interactions that are thought to underlie phase separation in formation of cellular membraneless organelles. Arginine can interact with nucleotide bases via hydrogen bonding and Ï€-stacking; thus , nucleotide conformers that provide access to the bases provide enhanced opportunities for RGG interactions. Methylation of RGG/RG regions , which is accomplished by protein arginine methyltransferase enzymes , occurs to different degrees in different cell types and may regulate the behavior of proteins containing these regions.
