  The objective of this study was to assess for independent association of anxiety<symptom> symptoms with epilepsy localization and other epilepsy-related and demographic factors in a large tertiary care adult epilepsy population. Among 540 adults , anxiety<symptom> was measured by the Symptom Checklist 90-R ( SCL-90R) anxiety<symptom> subscale , and detailed demographics , epilepsy localization , and depression<symptom> scores ( SCL-90R) were collected. High anxiety<symptom> was defined by SCL-90R anxiety<symptom> T-score â‰¥ 60. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was carried out to assess for independent association of high anxiety<symptom> scores with demographic and clinical factors. High anxiety<symptom> symptoms were present in 46.1 % of participants ( N = 250). Focal or unknown epilepsy type and depression<symptom> scores were independently associated with high anxiety<symptom> ( adjusted odds ratios ( OR): 2.89 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.33-6.29 , p = 0.007) and 2.12 ( 95 % CI = 1.83-2.45 , p < 0.001) , respectively; depression<symptom> odds per 5-point increase in scale). Among the focal epilepsy subpopulation , mesial temporal sclerosis was also independently associated with high anxiety<symptom> , with adjusted OR: 2.12 ( 95 % CI = 1.11-4.04 , p = 0.023). Lower education , non-white race/ethnicity , Spanish native language , prior head trauma , antiseizure drug polytherapy , and left focus or bilateral foci ( in focal epilepsy) were associated with high anxiety<symptom> in simple logistic regression , but these associations were not independent. A total of 46 individuals ( 18.4 % of those with high anxiety<symptom>) scored high for anxiety<symptom> but not depression<symptom> Only 26 % of those with high anxiety<symptom> symptoms were taking a potentially anxiolytic medication. Anxiety<symptom> symptoms , often without concomitant depression<symptom> , were highly prevalent in this epilepsy sample and independently associated with focal/unknown epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis. These results strongly support the value of screening specifically for anxiety<symptom> in the epilepsy clinic , to direct patients to appropriate treatment.
