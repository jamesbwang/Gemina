  Although reliability correlations of traditional power indices of the Wingate test have been well documented , no study has analyzed new generation power indices based on milliseconds obtained from a Peak Bike. The purpose of this study was to investigate the retest reliability of new generation power indices. Thirty-two well-trained male athletes who were specialized in basketball , football , tennis , or track and field volunteered to take part in the study ( age: 24.3 ± 2.2 years; body mass: 77 ± 8.3 kg; height: 180.3 ± 6.3 cm). Participants performed two Wingate all-out sessions on two separate days. Intra-class correlation coefficient ( ICC) , standard error measurement ( SEM) , smallest real differences ( SRD) and coefficient of variation ( CV) scores were analyzed based on the test and retest data. Reliability results of traditional power indices calculated based on 5-s means such as peak power , average power , power drop , and fatigue<symptom> index ratio were similar with the previous findings in literature ( ICC ≥ 0.94; CV ≤ 2.8 %; SEM ≤ 12.28; SRD % ≤ 7.7 %). New generation power indices such as peak power , average power , lowest power , power drop , fatigue<symptom> index , power decline , maximum speed as rpm , and amount of total energy expenditure demonstrated high reliability ( ICC ≥ 0.94; CV ≤ 4.3 %; SEM ≤ 10.36; SRD % ≤ 8.8 %). Time to peak power , time at maximum speed , and power at maximum speed showed a moderate level of reliability ( ICC ≥ 0.73; CV ≤ 8.9 %; SEM ≤ 63.01; SRD % ≤ 22.4 %). The results of this study indicate that reliability correlations and SRD % of new generation power and fatigue-related indices are similar with traditional 5-s means. However , new time-related indices are very sensitive and moderately reliable.
