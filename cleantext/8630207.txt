  Persons with clinically significant tinnitus<symptom> also may have mild sensorineural hearing loss ( MSNHL). The purpose of this study was to describe patients with tinnitus<symptom> and MSNHL and factors predicting hearing-aid uptake ( HAU). We conducted a retrospective chart review with regression modeling of patients presenting to a specialty tinnitus<symptom> clinic over a 2.5-year period. Stepwise logistic regression on data from patient charts was conducted. Of 133 patients seen , two-thirds had MSNHL ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 58.9-75.0; mean age = 53.4 years; standard deviation = 14.5); approximately 50 % had severe-to-catastrophic tinnitus<symptom>. Logistic regression indicated that four-frequency pure-tone average ( FFPTA; left) (
