  The article discusses management of a female patient with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction after an episode of acute decompensation. Replacing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a representative of a new angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor class , sacubitril/valsartan , in the combination therapy allowed fast achievement and maintenance of the compensation state. The treatment was well tolerated and was not associated with clinically significant adverse effects.
