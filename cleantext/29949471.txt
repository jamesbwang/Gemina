  As a first study in literature , to investigate concentration-dependent ( 0-400 Î¼g/ml) and exposure-dependent ( single dosing vs cumulative dosing) effects of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( d = 10 nm) on primary rat hepatocytes in a time-dependent manner. Sandwich-cultured hepatocyte model was used to evaluate viability , hepatocyte specific functions and reactive oxygen species level. In terms of all parameters , generally statistically more significant effects were observed in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In terms of hepatocyte-specific functions , cumulative dosing caused significantly ( p < 0.05) more deleterious effects at 48th hour. A combination of various biomarkers should be employed for the evaluation of the effect of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on liver , and each biomarker should be analyzed in a time- and exposure-dependent manner.
