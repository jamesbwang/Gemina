  The need for rapid data collection and studies of small sample volumes in the range of cubic millimetres are the main driving forces for the concept of a new high-throughput monochromatic diffraction instrument at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum ( MLZ) , Germany. A large region of reciprocal space will be accessed by a detector with sufficient dynamic range and microsecond time resolution , while allowing for a variety of complementary sample environments. The medium-resolution neutron powder diffraction option for ` energy research with neutrons ' ( ErwiN) at the high-flux FRM II neutron source at the MLZ is foreseen to meet future demand. ErwiN will address studies of energy-related systems and materials with respect to their structure and uniformity by means of bulk and spatially resolved neutron powder diffraction. A set of experimental options will be implemented , enabling time-resolved studies , rapid parametric measurements as a function of external parameters and studies of small samples using an adapted radial collimator. The proposed powder diffraction option ErwiN will bridge the gap in functionality between the high-resolution powder diffractometer SPODI and the time-of-flight diffractometers POWTEX and SAPHiR at the MLZ.
