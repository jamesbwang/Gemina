  In recent years , the zebrafish has become a powerful model not only for the developmental biology studies , but also for genetic analyses and drug screenings , mostly thanks to the ease with which its embryos can be manipulated and to its translucent body , which allows in vivo imaging. In this chapter , we will provide an overview of the current knowledge about the role of thyroid hormone receptors during zebrafish embryonic development. Moreover , we will explore the methodologies applied to zebrafish biology to knock down a gene of interest and to analyze in vivo the molecular mechanisms of the mutated receptors.
