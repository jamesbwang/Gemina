  The current study examined the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the Family Distress Index ( FDI). The FDI is an 8-item self-report measure that assesses family maladaptation , providing an index of family outcomes within the resiliency model of family stress , adjustment , and adaptation. Participants were 459 adults , who completed measures of family distress ( FDI) and family functioning ( Systemic Clinical Outcome Routine Evaluation; SCORE-15). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a unidimensional factorial structure. Results also indicated that the FDI has good internal consistency and temporal stability. The positive and significant correlation between FDI and SCORE-15 ' scores demonstrated its convergent validity. Through receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis , we determined a cut-off score of 12 for identifying probable family distress. In sum , the Portuguese version of the FDI is a valid and reliable instrument , which can foster the development of future empirical studies focused on family adaptation in diverse contexts of adversity , namely in health care settings.
