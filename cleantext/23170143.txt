  Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is typically refractory to conventional treatments and associated with poor prognosis. While therapeutic advances over the past several years have improved patient outcomes , the observed benefits have been modest at best , highlighting the need for continued development of alternate treatment strategies. The tumor microenvironment has been identified as being integral to oncogenesis through its direct effect on cellular pathway communication , immune inhibition , and promoting chemo-resistance. A more in depth understanding of the biology of the disease , in addition with our ability to develop more effective novel therapies have led to ongoing studies that are investigating several promising treatment options in this disease. Herein , we highlight and review the therapeutic landscape in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
