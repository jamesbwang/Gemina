  A facile composite was fabricated via direct assembly of nitrogen and sulfur co-decorated carbon dots with abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of the positively charged layered double hydroxide ( N,S-CDs-LDH). The novel N,S-CDs-LDH demonstrates highly selective bindings ( M-S) and an extremely efficient removal capacity for soft metal ions such as Ag
