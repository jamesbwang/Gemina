  Using the Richards-Wolf formulas for an arbitrary circularly polarized optical vortex with an integer topological charge m , we obtain explicit expressions for all components of the electric and magnetic field strength vectors near the focus , as well as expressions for the intensity ( energy density) and for the energy flux ( components of the Poynting vector) in the focal plane of an aplanatic optical system. For m = 2 , from the obtained expressions it follows that the energy flux near the optical axis propagates in the reversed direction , rotating along a spiral around the optical axis. On the optical axis itself , the reversed flux is maximal and decays rapidly with the distance from the axis. For m = 3 , in contrast , the reversed energy flux in the focal plane is minimal ( zero) on the optical axis and increases ( until the first ring of the light intensity) as a squared distance from the axis.
