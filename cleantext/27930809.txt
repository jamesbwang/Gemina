  Soft tissue tumors of infancy encompass an overlapping spectrum of diseases that pose unique diagnostic and clinical challenges. We studied genomes and transcriptomes of cryptogenic congenital mesoblastic nephroma ( CMN) , and extended our findings to five anatomically or histologically related soft tissue tumors: infantile fibrosarcoma ( IFS) , nephroblastomatosis , Wilms tumor , malignant rhabdoid tumor , and clear cell sarcoma<disease> of the kidney. A key finding is recurrent mutation of EGFR in CMN by internal tandem duplication of the kinase domain , thus delineating CMN from other childhood renal tumors. Furthermore , we identify BRAF intragenic rearrangements in CMN and IFS. Collectively these findings reveal novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies and highlight a prominent role of isolated intragenic rearrangements as drivers of infant tumors.
