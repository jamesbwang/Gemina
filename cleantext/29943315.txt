  The Japanese flounder is one of the most widely farmed economic flatfish species throughout eastern Asia including China , Korea , and Japan. Edwardsiella<pathogen> tarda<pathogen> is a major species of pathogenic bacteria that causes ascites disease and , consequently , a huge economy loss for Japanese flounder farming. After generation selection , traditional breeding methods can hardly improve the E.<pathogen> tarda<pathogen> resistance effectively. Genomic selection is an effective way to predict the breeding potential of parents and has rarely been used in aquatic breeding. In this study , we chose 931 individuals from 90 families , challenged by E.<pathogen> tarda<pathogen> from 2013 to 2015 as a reference population and 71 parents of these families as selection candidates. 1,934,475 markers were detected via genome sequencing and applied in this study. Two different methods , BayesCπ and GBLUP , were used for genomic prediction. In the reference population , two methods led to the same accuracy ( 0.946) and Pearson 's correlation results between phenotype and genomic estimated breeding value ( GEBV) of BayesCπ and GBLUP were 0.912 and 0.761 , respectively. In selection candidates , GEBVs from two methods were highly similar ( 0.980). A comparison of GEBV with the survival rate of families that were structured by selection candidates showed correlations of 0.662 and 0.665 , respectively. This study established a genomic selection method for the Japanese flounder and for the first time applied this to E.<pathogen> tarda<pathogen> resistance breeding.
