  To explore the association of plasma level of advanced oxidation protein products ( AOPPs) with Framingham risk score in type 2 diabetic patients without vascular diseases. This cross-sectional study was conducted among type 2 diabetic patients without vascular diseases recruited from 3 affiliated hospitals of Southern Medical University between March , 2010 and May , 2011 , with age- and gender-matched healthy individuals as the control group. The demographic data were collected from all the participants , and the biochemical indexes and plasma levels of AOPPs were examined. The risk of cardiovascular disease in 10 years was assessed for all the participants based on their Framingham risk scores. A total of 112 diabetic patients and 49 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. The diabetic patients had significantly higher body mass index ( BMI) , blood glucose , triglyceride , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) , plasma AOPPs and Framingham risk score but lower high-density lipoprotein level than the control subjects. Spearman correlation analysis showed that plasma level of AOPPs was positively correlated with the Framingham risk score ( r = -0.44 , P < 0.001) , and further multiple linear regression analysis suggested that plasma AOPPs level was independently correlated with the Framingham risk score ( Î²0 .305 , P < 0.001). Type 2 diabetic patients without vascular diseases have significantly higher plasma levels of AOPPs and are at a greater risk of cardiovascular events in 10 years than healthy individuals. Plasma AOPPs are positively correlated with the Framingham risk score , suggesting the value of plasma AOPPs level in predicting the risk of cardiovascular events in these patients.
