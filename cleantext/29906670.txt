  Theory of mind ( ToM) can be divided into cognitive and affective ToM , and a distinction can be made between overmentalizing and undermentalizing errors. Research has shown that ToM in schizophrenia is associated with non-social and social cognition , and with clinical symptoms. In this study , we investigate cognitive and clinical predictors of different ToM processes. Ninety-one individuals with schizophrenia participated. ToM was measured with the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition ( MASC) yielding six scores ( total ToM , cognitive ToM , affective ToM , overmentalizing errors , undermentalizing errors and no mentalizing errors). Neurocognition was indexed by a composite score based on the non-social cognitive tests in the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery ( MCCB). Emotion perception was measured with Emotion in Biological Motion ( EmoBio) , a point-light walker task. Clinical symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome<disease> Scale ( PANSS). Seventy-one healthy control ( HC) participants completed the MASC. Individuals with schizophrenia showed large impairments compared to HC for all MASC scores , except overmentalizing errors. Hierarchical regression analyses with the six different MASC scores as dependent variables revealed that MCCB was a significant predictor of all MASC scores , explaining 8-18 % of the variance. EmoBio increased the explained variance significantly , to 17-28 % , except for overmentalizing errors. PANSS excited symptoms increased explained variance for total ToM , affective ToM and no mentalizing errors. Both social and non-social cognition were significant predictors of ToM. Overmentalizing was only predicted by non-social cognition. Excited symptoms contributed to overall and affective ToM , and to no mentalizing errors.
