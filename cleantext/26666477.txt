  Emerging evidence suggests a link between coronary artery disease and type 2 immunity. We sought to test the hypothesis that IgE sensitization to the mammalian oligosaccharide galactose-α-1,3-galactose ( α-Gal)- the target allergen of delayed anaphylaxis to red meat-is associated with coronary artery disease. Total IgE and specific IgE to α-Gal were assayed on sera from 118 subjects who presented for cardiac catheterization and underwent intravascular ultrasound. IgE to α-Gal was detected in 26 % , and atheroma burden was higher in sensitized subjects ( Increased atheroma burden and plaques with more unstable features were associated with IgE to α-Gal-an effect most pronounced in subjects ≤ 65 years of age. IgE sensitization to α-Gal may represent a novel , and potentially modifiable , risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis.
