  Background Voriconazole is extensively metabolized by the CYP450 isoenzymes 2C19 and 3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9; therefore , any medication that affects this pathway can alter its plasma concentration. Treatment failure can probably occur if subtherapeutic levels are achieved. Case description A 32-year-old woman who suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> was admitted and received treatment with vincristine and dexamethasone. After several days , to control her fever<disease> , based on two consecutive positive serum galactomannan test results , voriconazole as an antifungal agent was added to Aspergillus infection treatment. Through the first week after voriconazole initiation , its plasma concentrations were subtherapeutic. The most suspicious medication for interaction was dexamethasone , which can induce CYP450 isoenzymes and reduce plasma concentration. Conclusion As a result of the narrow therapeutic window of voriconazole and the relationship between efficacy and plasma concentration of azoles , therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole in patients receiving a high dose of glucocorticoids is recommended , in order to achieve optimal response to treatment and toxicity reduction. Further studies regarding the interaction between voriconazole and dexamethasone to prevent clinically relevant interactions should be considered.
