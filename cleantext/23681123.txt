  Multiciliated ependymal cells line all brain cavities. The beating of their motile cilia contributes to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid , which is required for brain homoeostasis and functions. Motile cilia , nucleated from centrioles , persist once formed and withstand the forces produced by the external fluid flow and by their own cilia beating. Here , we show that a dense actin network around the centrioles is induced by cilia beating , as shown by the disorganisation of the actin network upon impairment of cilia motility. Moreover , disruption of the actin network , or specifically of the apical actin network , causes motile cilia and their centrioles to detach from the apical surface of ependymal cell. In conclusion , cilia beating controls the apical actin network around centrioles; the mechanical resistance of this actin network contributes , in turn , to centriole stability.
