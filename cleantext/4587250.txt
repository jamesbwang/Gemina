  Self-sustained metabolic pathways in microcompartments are the corner-stone for living systems. From a technological viewpoint , such pathways are a mandatory prerequisite for the reliable design of artificial cells functioning out-of-equilibrium. Here we develop a microfluidic platform for the miniaturization and analysis of metabolic pathways in man-made microcompartments formed of water-in-oil droplets. In a modular approach , we integrate in the microcompartments a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD)- dependent enzymatic reaction and a NAD-regeneration module as a minimal metabolism. We show that the microcompartments sustain a metabolically active state until the substrate is fully consumed. Reversibly , the external addition of the substrate reboots the metabolic activity of the microcompartments back to an active state. We therefore control the metabolic state of thousands of independent monodisperse microcompartments , a step of relevance for the construction of large populations of metabolically active artificial cells.
