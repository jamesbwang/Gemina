  Ambient-temperature sodium-sulfur ( Na-S) batteries are considered a promising energy storage system due to their high theoretical energy density and low costs. However , great challenges remain in achieving a high rechargeable capacity and long cycle life. Herein we report a stable quasi-solid-state Na-S battery enabled by a poly ( S-pentaerythritol tetraacrylate ( PETEA))- based cathode and a ( PETEA-tris ( 2- ( acryloyloxy) ethyl) isocyanurate ( THEICTA))- based gel polymer electrolyte. The polymeric sulfur electrode strongly anchors sulfur through chemical binding and inhibits the shuttle effect. Meanwhile , the in situ formed polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and enhanced safety successfully stabilizes the Na anode/electrolyte interface , and simultaneously immobilizes soluble Na polysulfides. The as-developed quasi-solid-state Na-S cells exhibit a high reversible capacity of 877 mA h g
