  Piceatannol , a grape-derived polyphenol , has been linked to proarrhythmic properties by aggravating inhomogeneous conduction delay in the ischemia-reperfusion ( IR) zone to enhance arrhythmogenic alternans in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) rabbits. The underlying molecular mechanisms of piceatannol-induced conduction disturbance were unclear in this model. HF was induced by 4 weeks ' rapid ventricular pacing. IR injury was induced in vivo using a protocol of left coronary artery ligation and release. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated enzymatically for whole-cell patch-clamp studies. Piceatannol ( 10 Î¼M) was administrated to test its inhibitory effect on sodium current ( I Peak I Downregulation of NaV 1.5 protein expression and reduced peak I
