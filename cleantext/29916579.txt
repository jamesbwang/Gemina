  The correspondence between biomarkers and the complex interaction of toxics with the human organism has been fully described years ago by the American National Research Council which developed a precious diagram. This model is still valid in describing the new methodologic agnostic or `` omic '' approaches to the science of exposure. Reference values and exposome share indeed the search for internal dose biomarkers; adduttomics may be seen as an evolution of the target dose markers while epigenetics itself is a new way of exploring the world of early effect biomarkers.
