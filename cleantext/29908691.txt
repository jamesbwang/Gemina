  For those diagnosed with pancreatic cancer , ill-addressed pancreatic exocrine insufficiency ( PEI) following surgery can result in malnutrition related complications that may impact on predict mortality and morbidity. The use of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy ( PERT) is recommended and often demands a degree of patient self-management. Understanding more about how this treatment is managed is fundamental to optimising care. This study aimed to explore patient self-management of PERT following surgery for pancreatic cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine participants. Eligible participants included adult patients who had undergone surgery for a malignancy in the pancreatic region and were prescribed PERT post-operatively. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse our findings. Data analysis revealed three overarching themes; the role of professional support , factors influencing decisions to use PERT in symptom management and the challenges of socializing. The difficulties negotiated by participants were considerable as they struggled with the complexities of PERT. Symptom management and subsequently reported physical repercussions and undesirable social implications were problematic. Professional support was largely inconsistent and relinquished prematurely following discharge. Consequently , this impacted on how PERT was self-managed. Enabling patients to appropriately self-manage PERT may lessen the post-treatment burden. Our findings suggest that support should continue throughout the recovery phase and should address the patient 's ` self-management journey '. Intervention by healthcare professionals , such as a specialist dietitian is likely to be beneficial. Furthermore there are focal issues , primarily explicit education and appropriately timed information that require consideration by those developing and delivering services.
