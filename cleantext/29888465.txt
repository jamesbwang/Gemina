  Photodermatoses represent a heterogeneous collection of disorders unified by the characteristic of being provoked through exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Generally , these conditions are classified into the following categories: immunologically mediated photodermatoses , chemical- and drug-induced photosensitivity , photoaggravated dermatoses and photosensitivity associated with defective DNA repair mechanisms or chromosomal instabilities. The list of photodermatoses is extensive , and each individual photodermatosis is understood to a different extent. Regardless , there exists a paucity of information with regards to the clinical presentation among those with skin of colour. With ever-changing global demographics , recognition of photosensitive disorders in a diverse population is essential for accurate diagnoses and therapeutic guidance. The scope of this article seeks to review the epidemiology and clinical variability in presentation of such photodermatoses in patients with skin of colour.
