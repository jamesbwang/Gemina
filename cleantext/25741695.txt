  Preoperative renal insufficiency is an independent predictor of mortality after coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG) surgery. However , there are few reports aimed to evaluate the impact of mild preoperative renal insufficiency on long-term follow-up outcomes after isolated CABG surgery. This study investigates the effect of mild preoperative renal insufficiency on long-term follow-up outcomes of patients after CABG. Five hundred eighty-four patients ' data that underwent CABG between 1 January 2009 and 1 December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into two groups: normal group ( Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) â‰¥ 90 ml/min/1 .73 m2 , n = 304) and mild group ( eGFR ranges from 60 to 89 ml/min/1 .73 m2 , n = 280). Clinical material and long follow-up outcomes were compared inthe two groups. Two groups had similar baseline and intraoperative data except eGFR. Six ( 0.01 %) patients died in hospital , 15 in normal group and 28 in mild group during the long-term follow-up , which had statistical significance ( P < 0.05). Univariate factor analysis displayed that the two groups had similar in-hospital outcomes. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a better long-term survival in patients with normal preoperative renal function compared to mild preoperative renal insufficiency ( x 2 = 4.255 , P = 0.039). Cox proportional model presented the hazard ratio of long-term mortality in patients with mild preoperative renal insufficiency compared to normal preoperative renal function was 1.79 ( 95 % CI 1.17-2.88 , P = 0.027). Patients with mild preoperative renal insufficiency had a higher mortality rate than normal patients in long-term survival , whereas no evidence of worse in-hospital mortality rate was found. Patients with mild preoperative renal insufficiency showed a higher mortality rate than other studies.
