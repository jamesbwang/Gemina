  An anatomical study was performed to describe the endoscopic anatomy and variations of the protympanum , including classification of the protiniculum and subtensor recess. A retrospective review was conducted of video recordings of cadaveric dissections and surgical procedures , which included visualisation of the protympanum , across 4 tertiary university referral centres over a 16-month period. A total of 97 ears<disease> were used in the analysis. A quadrangular conformation of the protympanum was seen in 60 per cent of ears<disease> and a triangular conformation in 40 per cent. The protiniculum was type A ( ridge) in 58 per cent , type B ( bridge) in 23 per cent and type C ( absent) in 19 per cent. The subtensor recess was type A ( absent) in 30 per cent , type B ( shallow) in 48 per cent and type C ( deep) in 22 per cent. The protympanum is an area that has been ignored for many years because of difficulties in visualising it with an operating microscope. However , modern endoscopic equipment has changed this , providing detailed anatomical knowledge fundamental to ensuring the safety of endoscopic surgical procedures in the region.
