  The aim of this study was to compare peripheral arm ports versus central chest ports in complication rates. Late complications of arm ports versus chest ports , including catheter-related<disease> infection<disease> , venous thrombosis and catheter obstruction , remain controversial. A meta-analysis conducted following the Cochrane handbook. Studies published between 1950-August 2017 were searched through Pubmed , Embase , Web of science and Cochrane library. Two authors independently searched the eligible studies and extracted the data. Studies reporting complications of arm ports compared with chest ports , published in full texts and abstracts , were included. The quality of the studies was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We did subgroup analyses according to cancer type , age , follow-up and anticoagulant. Relative ratios were calculated with different models. A total of 15 articles covering 3,524 tumour patients met the eligibility criteria. There was no difference in catheter-related<disease> infection<disease> and catheter obstruction between arm ports and chest ports. After reducing the high heterogeneity , no difference was observed in thrombosis overall; however , arm ports had a lower thrombosis rate than chest ports in patients with head and neck cancer , while a higher thrombosis rate was observed in patients < 60 years old or follow up â‰¥ 1 year. Further studies are needed in venous thrombosis. Arm ports are a safe option beside chest ports for adult patients with malignancy , especially in patients with head-neck cancer or breast cancer. Patients should be well informed of the advantages and disadvantages of different vascular access devices and provided a choice.
