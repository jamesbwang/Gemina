  To assess adverse outcomes attributable to non-cardiac co-morbidities and to compare their effects by left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) group ( LVEF < 50 % ( heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction , HFrEF) , LVEF ≥ 50 % ( heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction , HFpEF)) in a contemporary , unselected chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> population. This community-based cohort enrolled patients from October 2009 to December 2013. Adjusted hazard ratio ( HR) and the population attributable fraction ( PAF) were used to compare the contribution of 15 non-cardiac co-morbidities to adverse outcome. Overall , 2314 patients ( mean age 77 ± 10 years , 57 % men) were recruited ( n = 941 ( 41 %) HFrEF , n = 1373 ( 59 %) HFpEF). Non-cardiac co-morbidity rates were similarly high , except for obesity and hypertension which were more prevalent in HFpEF. At a median follow-up of 31 ( interquartile range 16-41) months , 472 ( 20 %) patients died. Adjusted mortality rates were not significantly different between the HFrEF and HFpEF groups. After adjustment , an increasing number of non-cardiac co-morbidities was associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality ( HR 1.25; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.10-1.26; P < 0.001) , all-cause hospitalization ( HR 1.17; 95 % CI 1.12-1.23; P < 0.001) , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalization ( HR 1.28; 95 % CI 1.19-1.38; P < 0.001) , non-cardiovascular hospitalization ( HR 1.16; 95 % CI 1.11-1.22; P < 0.001). The co-morbidities contributing to high PAF were: anaemia , chronic kidney disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , diabetes mellitus , and peripheral artery disease. These findings were similar for HFrEF and HFpEF. Interaction analysis yielded similar results. In a contemporary community population with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , non-cardiac co-morbidities confer a similar contribution to outcomes in HFrEF and HFpEF. These observations suggest that quality improvement initiatives aimed at optimizing co-morbidities may be similarly effective in HFrEF and HFpEF.
