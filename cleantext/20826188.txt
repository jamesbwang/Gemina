  Epidemiological studies in patients with neuropathic pain demonstrate a strong association with psychiatric conditions such as anxiety<symptom>; however , the precipitating pathology between these symptoms remains unclear. To investigate this , we studied the effects of lifelong stress on levels of neuropathic pain-like behavior and conversely , the effects of chronic neuropathic injury on anxiety-like status in male and female mice. In addition , we assayed this link in painful and painless diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients. Male and female mice were subject to ongoing life-stress or control living conditions. Baseline sensitivity and anxiety<symptom> tests were measured followed by spared nerve injury ( SNI) to the sciatic nerve. Subsequent sensory testing occurred until 3 weeks after SNI followed by anxiety<symptom> tests between 4 and 6 weeks after SNI. Levels of tactile or cold allodynia did not differ between adult mice subject to lifelong chronic stress , relative to nonstressed controls , for at least 3 weeks after SNI. By contrast , longer-term neuropathic mice of both sexes displayed pronounced anxiety-like behavior , regardless of exposure to stress. If sex differences were present , females usually exhibited more pronounced anxiety-like behavior. These ongoing anxiety<symptom> behaviors were corroborated with plasma corticosterone levels in distinct animal groups. In addition , data from patients with painful and nonpainful diabetic neuropathy showed a clear relationship between ongoing pain and anxiety<symptom> , with females generally more affected than males. Taken together , these data demonstrate a strong link between chronic neuropathic pain and chronic anxiety<symptom> , with the driver of this comorbidity being neuropathic pain as opposed to on-going stress.
