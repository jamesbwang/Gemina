  To compare perinatal outcomes of dinoprostone for induced labor in pregnancies with a borderline versus normal amniotic fluid index ( AFI) at term , and to investigate the related factors affecting outcomes of cesarean section. The retrospective study was carried out in Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital with singleton pregnancies of 37-42 weeks ' gestation from January to August 2016. A total of 992 subjects were divided into two groups: borderline AFI group ( n = 125) with 5 < AFI ≤ 8 and normal AFI group ( n = 867) with 8 < AFI ≤ 24. Time to delivery ( P = 0.004) and use of oxytocin augmentation ( P = 0.011) were significantly lower in pregnancies with borderline AFI. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of delivery mode , time to onset of labor , fetal distress , Apgar scores , meconium-stained amniotic fluid , birth weight , or incidences of admission to neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU). Gestational hypertension and birth weight were the major factors affecting outcomes of cesarean section in the borderline group ( odds ratio ( OR) = 13.61 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.96-94.49 , P = 0.008 and OR = 1.003 , 95 % CI 1.001-1.005 , P = 0.001 , respectively). Maternal age ( OR = 1.12 , 95 % CI 1.06-1.19 , P < 0.001) , parity ( OR = 7.57 , 95 % CI 3.05-18.76 , P < 0.001) , biparietal diameter ( OR = 0.55 , 95 % CI 0.33-0.91 , P = 0.021) , and meconium-stained amniotic fluid ( OR = 1.56 , 95 % CI 1.12-2.17 , P = 0.009) were related factors in the normal group. The perinatal outcomes of dinoprostone for induced labor are comparable between the two groups. Gestational hypertension and birth weight are factors related to outcomes of cesarean section in the borderline group.
