  We describe a case of a 57-year-old man referred to an oral maxillofacial surgeon for a nontender , large intramuscular tongue mass. A computed tomography scan with contrast showed a homogenous right tongue intramuscular fatty mass measuring 3.8 cm Ã— 2.8 cm in the axial dimension and 2.2 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. Histologic examination revealed multiple lobulated sections of mature adipocytes and occasional entrapped skeletal muscle fibers. The final pathologic diagnosis was intramuscular lipoma. Although lipomas account for approximately 50 % of all soft tissue neoplasms , intramuscular ( infiltrating) lipoma of the tongue is exceedingly rare.
