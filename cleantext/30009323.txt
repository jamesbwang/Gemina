  Persistent alopecia ( PA) after docetaxel has been recently described. The aim of our study is to establish the incidence and characteristics of PA following adjuvant docetaxel for breast cancer ( BC) and to test the ability of scalp cooling in prevention. BC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy followed or not by endocrine therapy ( and a control group receiving only endocrine therapy) were interviewed in a single institution at 1.5 to 5 years following primary diagnosis searching for PA.. A confirmatory prevalence study was later performed in other two institutions. Finally , a prevention study using prophylactic scalp cooling ( PSC) with ELASTO-GEL hypothermia<symptom> caps in patients receiving adjuvant docetaxel was performed. In the initial prevalence study ( 492 patients) , minor forms of PA ( grade 1) were recorded with all chemotherapy regimens and aromatase inhibitors. Patients receiving docetaxel regimens at cumulative dose ( CD) ≥ 400 mmg/m Adjuvant treatment with docetaxel ( CD ≥ 400 mmg/m
