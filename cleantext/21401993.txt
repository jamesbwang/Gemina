  The aim of this paper was to describe the development of an intervention that is developed to improve communication about the heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) trajectory and end-of-life care. We also present data that provides a first insight in specific areas of feasibility of the intervention. Co-design was used and patients , family members and health care professionals were constructive participants in the design process of the intervention. Feasibility of the intervention was tested in two areas; acceptability and limited efficacy. Two communication tools were designed and evaluated; 1) a Question Prompt List ( QPL) for patients and family members and 2) a communication course for professionals which was web- based with one face-to-face training day with simulation. Data on feasibility was collected with questionnaires that were developed for this study , from the 13 participants who completed the course ( all nurses). They reported improved knowledge , confidence and skills to discuss the HF trajectory and end-of-life care. The QPL was evaluated to be a useful tool in communication with patients and family members. In a co-design process , future users identified the need for a QPL and a communication course. These communication tools can be used as a dual intervention to improve communication about the HF trajectory and end-of-life care. The QPL can help patients and families to ask questions about the HF trajectory and end-of-life care. The communication course can prepare the professionals to be knowledgeable , confident and skilled to discuss the questions in the QPL. Before the tools are ready for implementation in clinical practice , further studies testing the feasibility of the intervention are needed , including also patients and their families.
