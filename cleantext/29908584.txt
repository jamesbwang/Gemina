  The healing process after breast cancer treatment is predominantly focused toward the physical changes to the body that a patient has experienced. Breast reconstructions are considered standard of care after mastectomy , and the nipple and areolar complex is often reconstructed as well , using a combination of skin graft and tattoo. A patient who decided to forego nipple reconstruction and areolar tattooing and instead chooses to apply decorative temporary tattoos to her breast reconstruction is described. Compared with permanent tattoos , these unconventional tattoos allow the patient to change the design to fit her mood. Unconventional tattoos are an alternative and creative approach to the healing process , in which artistic and individual expression allows the patient to embrace the physical change she has undergone as a breast cancer survivor.
