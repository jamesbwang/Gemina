  During mini<pathogen> C-arm fluoroscopy , both the patient and surgical team are exposed to scatter radiation. The objective of this study was to quantify body , thyroid , and hand radiation exposure to surgeon and assistant during intraoperative use of flat panel mini<pathogen> C-arm fluoroscopy in hand and wrist surgical procedures. Over 5 months , the surgeon 's and assistant 's radiation exposure was recorded during all osseous hand and wrist surgical procedures. Whole-body and thyroid radiation exposure were measured with 2 types of dosimeters: a photon thermoluminescence detector and a RaySafe i2 real-time dosimeter. Ring dosimeters were used to quantify hand radiation exposure. Mini<pathogen> C-arm fluoroscopy was used in 94 surgical procedures. Total fluoroscopy time was 1,996 seconds and varied between surgical procedures ( range , 1-152 seconds; median , 11 seconds). No thermoluminescence detector photon dosimeter exceeded the threshold limit of 0.1 mSv. The RaySafe i2 real-time dosimeters recorded a cumulated dose of 0.029 mSv for the body and 0.012 mSv for the thyroid position of the surgeon. The assistant received a cumulated dose of 0.011 mSv for the body and 0.011 mSv for the thyroid position. The ring dosimeters showed a cumulated dosage of 1.28 mSv for the surgeon and 0.20 mSv for the assistant. Our results show that the surgeon 's and assistant 's body , thyroid , and hands were exposed to acceptable levels of scatter radiation during intraoperative use of the flat panel mini<pathogen> C-arm. The surgeon received the highest radiation exposure: 2.9 % of the yearly radiation limits for the body , 0.05 % for the thyroid position , and 2.56 % for the hands. The assistant was exposed to less scatter radiation: 1.1 % for the body , 0.04 % for the thyroid , and 0.4 % for the hands. This study quantified radiation levels to which surgeon and assistant are exposed during mini<pathogen> C-arm fluoroscopy in hand and wrist surgical procedures.
