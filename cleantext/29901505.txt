  This study aimed to report the computed tomography ( CT) imaging features of primary small cell neuroendocrine tumors of the gallbladder ( PSCNETGs). The CT examinations of 9 patients ( 5 women , 4 men; median age , 57 years) with histopathologically proven PSCNETG were reviewed. Computed tomographic images were analyzed with respect to morphologic features of primary tumors and accompanying lymph nodes. All PSCNETGs were visible on CT , with a median largest axial diameter of 60 mm ( Q1 , 30 mm; Q3 mm , 82; range , 25-86 mm). These tumors presented with extraluminal growth ( 8/9; 89 %) , heterogeneous enhancement ( 8/9; 89 %) , gallbladder replacement greater than 50 % ( 5/9; 56 %) , hepatic metastases ( 5/9; 56 %) , and direct liver involvement by tumor ( 4/9; 44 %). Enlarged lymph nodes were present in all patients ( 9/9; 100 %) with a median largest axial diameter of 39 mm ( Q1 , 23 mm; Q3 , 48 mm; range , 12-62 mm). Vessel encasement by lymph nodes was present in 6 ( 67 %) of 9 patients. Primary small cell neuroendocrine tumors of the gallbladder predominantly presents as a large , heterogeneous gallbladder mass with extraluminal growth in association with large metastatic lymph nodes and intrahepatic metastases.
