  Ipilimumab is the first US FDA-approved immune checkpoint-blocking antibody drug to harness the patient 's own immune cells. One of the postmarketing requirements is to develop a cell-based neutralizing antibody assay. Here , we share some of the most challenging aspects encountered during the assay development: new cell line construction; an unexpected inhibition of T-cell activation by low concentrations of ipilimumab; and two issues caused by sample pretreatment with acid dissociation to overcome drug interference: instability of neutralizing antibody positive control at low pH , and incompatibility of commonly used acid dissociation buffers in the cell assay. After troubleshooting and optimization , we successfully validated the assay and used the assay to test clinical samples to date.
