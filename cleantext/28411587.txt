  MYF5 is member of the Myc-like basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family and , in cooperation with other myogenic regulatory factors MYOD and MYF5 , is a key regulator of early stages of myogenesis. Here , we report three consanguineous families with biallelic homozygous loss-of-function mutations in MYF5 who define a clinical disorder characterized by congenital ophthalmoplegia<symptom> with scoliosis and vertebral and rib anomalies. The clinical phenotype overlaps strikingly with that reported in several Myf5 knockout mouse models. Affected members of two families share a haploidentical region that contains a homozygous 10 bp frameshift mutation in exon 1 of MYF5 ( c. 23_32delAGTTCTCACC ( p.Gln8Leufs
