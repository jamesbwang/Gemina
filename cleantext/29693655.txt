  In the version of this News and Views originally published , the author made an incorrect reference to ` mice deficient in Mx1 '. This has now been corrected so that the text instead refers to ` mice congenic for Mx1 '. The full corrected sentence reads as `` Pretreatment of mice congenic for Mx1 , an ISG that is critical for protection of animals from influenza<disease> , with intranasal neomycin significantly improved survival; however , about 50 % of the mice died.
