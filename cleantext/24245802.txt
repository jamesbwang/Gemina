  Research relating to alcohol use amongst university students primarily examines the effects of binge drinking. Researchers rarely focus on a range of drinking styles including light or non-drinking. This study was designed to gain an in-depth understanding of the lived experiences of female , first year UK undergraduates , who do not drink alcohol. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants. Narratives were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis ( IPA; by Smith and Osborn ( Sage 51-80 , 2003). Three superordinate themes were identified: `` managing the feeling that you do n't belong '' highlights the importance of managing social interactions as a non-drinker; `` experiencing social exclusion '' recognises the impact on social bonding as a result of insufficient socialising opportunities; and `` experiencing peer pressure and social stigma '' highlights the scrutiny and labelling participants endured. These findings provide an understanding of some of the difficulties experienced by these undergraduates as a result of their non-drinking status. Implications of this research are discussed and areas for future research are outlined.
