  The aim of this work was to evaluate the bioenergy potential of cocoa residue via anaerobic digestion. Batch and fed-batch lab-scale reactors were operated under low and high solids conditions. In the batch tests , 59 Â± 4 % of Chemical Oxygen Demand ( COD) was recovered as methane. This corresponded with an average methane yield of 174 ( wet) and 193 ( dry) L kg
