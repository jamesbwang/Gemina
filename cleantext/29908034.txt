  Temporomandibular disorder ( TMD) is an umbrella condition presenting several signs and symptoms including pain in the temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) and masticatory muscles , articular noises , earache , headache<symptom> , irregular or restricted jaw function , chewing difficulty , and limited mouth<symptom> opening. Such TMD impairment may cause disorders during the chewing process. Therefore , the purpose of this systematic review was to assess chewing dysfunctions measured by sEMG , and their association with TMD. A combination and variation in the descriptors `` temporomandibular joint disorders '' , `` masticatory dysfunctions '' , and electromyography were used to perform the searches across databases. The databases chosen were: LILACS , PubMed , Science Direct , Scopus , and Web of Science. Additionally , grey literature was assessed using Google Scholar , ProQuest , and OpenGrey. Studies in adults that diagnosed TMD through the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders ( RDC/TMD) , Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders ( DC/TMD) or Helkimo Protocol were selected. Furthermore , those studies should have evaluated chewing processes through surface electromyography ( sEMG). Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed through the Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument ( MAStARI) tool. Eleven included studies shown significant results; however , they evaluated discrepant parameters , presented high inconsistency in the application , and had chosen different tasks to analyse the sEMG and hence , there was no consensus in the results of studies. In conclusion , strength of recommendations was very low due to a series of limitations on studies and it was not possible to made categorical statement about association between TMD and chewing dysfunctions in adults when parameters of sEMG were analysed.
