  Human papillomaviruses ( HPVs) have evolved to use the DNA repair machinery to replicate its DNA genome in differentiated cells. HPV activates the DNA damage response ( DDR) in infected cells. Cellular DDR factors are recruited to the HPV DNA genome and position the cellular DNA polymerase on the HPV DNA and progeny genomes are synthesized. Following HPV DNA replication , HPV late gene expression is activated. Recent research has shown that the DDR factors also interact with RNA binding proteins and affects RNA processing. DDR factors activated by DNA damage and that associate with HPV DNA can recruit splicing factors and RNA binding proteins to the HPV DNA and induce HPV late gene expression. This induction is the result of altered alternative polyadenylation and splicing of HPV messenger RNA ( mRNA). HPV uses the DDR machinery to replicate its DNA genome and to activate HPV late gene expression at the level of RNA processing.
