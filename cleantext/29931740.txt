  Understanding the neural substrates of depression<symptom> is crucial for diagnosis and treatment. Here , we review recent studies of functional and effective connectivity in depression<symptom> , in terms of functional integration in the brain. Findings from these studies , including our own , point to the involvement of at least four networks in patients with depression<symptom> Elevated connectivity of a ventral limbic affective network appears to be associated with excessive negative mood ( dysphoria) in the patients; decreased connectivity of a frontal-striatal reward network has been suggested to account for loss of interest , motivation , and pleasure ( anhedonia); enhanced default mode network connectivity seems to be associated with depressive rumination; and diminished connectivity of a dorsal cognitive control network is thought to underlie cognitive deficits especially ineffective top-down control of negative thoughts and emotions in depressed patients. Moreover , the restoration of connectivity of these networks-and corresponding symptom improvement-following antidepressant treatment ( including medication , psychotherapy , and brain stimulation techniques) serves as evidence for the crucial role of these networks in the pathophysiology of
