  The tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- Î±- induced protein 8 ( TNFAIP8/TIPE) family is a death effector domain ( DED)- containing protein family with four identified members: TNFAIP8 ( TIPE) , TNFAIP8L1 ( TIPE1) , TNFAIP8L2 ( TIPE2) , and TNFAIP8L3 ( TIPE3). These proteins were found to play crucial roles in the regulation of immune homeostasis , inflammation<symptom> , and cancer development. Intensive research in the past two decades revealed a strong correlation of TIPE proteins with the development of various cancers including cancers of the bladder , blood , bone , breast , cervix , colon , esophagus , endometrium , stomach , liver , lung , ovary , pancreas , prostate , and thyroid gland. Also , deregulation of these proteins was found to promote the essential hallmarks of cancer such as survival , tumor growth , proliferation , inhibition of apoptosis , angiogenesis , invasion , migration , and metastasis. Further , differential expression of these proteins in normal and cancer tissues and their association with tumor progression and prognosis signifies the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of TIPE proteins and their importance in cancer therapy. The current review summarizes the literature available thus far on the expression , function , and role of TIPE proteins in the development and maintenance of various cancers.
