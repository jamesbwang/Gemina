  Around the world , people migrate from poorer countries with less educational opportunity to richer ones with greater educational opportunity. In this journey , they bring their family obligation values into societies that value individual achievement. This process can create home-school cultural value conflict-conflict between family and academic obligations-for the children of Latina/o immigrants who attend universities in the United States. We hypothesised that this conflict causes cognitive disruption. One-hundred sixty-one Latina/o first-generation university students ( called college students in the United States) were randomly assigned to one of four experimental prompts; thereafter , the students engaged in an attentional control task ( i.e. , the Stroop test). For Latina/o students living close to home , prompting a home-school cultural value conflict was more deleterious to attentional control than the other conditions. In addition , across all Latina/o students , a comparison of performance before and after President Trump 's election and inauguration showed that prompting family obligation ( without mention of conflict) led to a significantly greater loss of attentional control after Trump was elected and inaugurated , compared with before Trump. We hypothesise that this effect resulted from Trump 's threats and actions to deport undocumented Latina/o immigrants , thus making fear about the fate of family members more salient and cognitively disruptive.
