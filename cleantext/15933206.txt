  To evaluate the reproducibility and repeatability of Hill-Sachs lesion<symptom> measurement from computed tomography images , with computer software and tridimensional prototype. Three-dimensional models were made from computed tomography images from 14 patients with anterior shoulder instability , using InVesalius 3.0 There was intra-observer and inter-observer variability for measurement of the same model. Observers did not perform the measurements in a similar way , showing difficulty to use the method ( There was no reproducibility and repeatability for Hill-Sachs lesion<symptom> measurement between plaster models and software models.
