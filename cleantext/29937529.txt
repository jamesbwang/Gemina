  Fracture failure caused by hydrogen embrittlement ( HE) is a major concern for the system reliability and safety of hydrogen storage vessels , which are generally made of 2.25 Cr1Mo0 .25 V steel. Thus , study of the influence of pre-charged hydrogen on fracture toughness of as-received 2.25 Cr1Mo0 .25 V steel and weld is of significant importance. In the current work , the influence of hydrogen on fracture toughness of as-received 2.25 Cr1Mo0 .25 V steel and weld was systematically studied. Base metal ( BM) and weld metal ( WM) specimens under both hydrogen-free and hydrogen-charged conditions were tested using three-point bending tests. Hydrogen was pre-charged inside specimens by the immersion charging method. The J-integral values were calculated for quantitatively evaluating the fracture toughness. In order to investigate the HE mechanisms , optical microscopy ( OM) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) were used to characterize the microstructure of BM and WM specimens. The results revealed that the presence of pre-charged hydrogen caused a significant decrease of the fracture toughness for both BM and WM specimens. Moreover , the pre-charged hydrogen led to a remarkable transition of fracture mode from ductile to brittle pattern in 2.25 Cr1Mo0 .25 V steel.
