  Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome<disease> ( HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder that leads to premature aging. In this study , we used induced pluripotent stem cells to investigate the hypopigmentation phenotypes observed in patients with progeria. Accordingly , two iPS cell lines were derived from cells from HGPS patients and differentiated into melanocytes. Measurements of melanin content revealed a lower synthesis of melanin in HGPS melanocytes as compared to non-pathologic cells. Analysis of the melanosome maturation process by electron microscopy revealed a lower percentage of mature , fully pigmented melanosomes. Finally , a functional rescue experiment revealed the direct role of progerin in the regulation of melanogenesis. Overall , these results report a new dysregulated pathway in HGPS and open up novel perspectives in the study of pigmentation phenotypes that are associated with normal and pathological aging.
