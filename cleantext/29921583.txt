  Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA) are produced in some unicellular organisms , such as marine gammaproteobacteria , myxobacteria and thraustochytrids , by large enzyme complexes called PUFA synthases. These enzymatic complexes resemble bacterial antibiotic-producing proteins known as polyketide synthases ( PKS). One of the PUFA synthase subunits is a conserved large protein ( PfaA in marine proteobacteria) that contains three to nine tandem Acyl Carrier Protein domains as well as condensation and modification domains. In this work , a study of the PfaA architecture and its ability to initiate the synthesis by selecting malonyl units has been carried out. As a result , we have observed a self-acylation ability in tandem ACPs whose biochemical mechanism differ from the previously described for type II PKS. The acyltransferase domain of PfaA showed a high selectivity for malonyl-CoA that efficiently loads onto the ACPs domains. These results , together with the structural organization predicted for PfaA , suggest that this protein plays a key role at early stages of the anaerobic pathway of PUFA synthesis.
