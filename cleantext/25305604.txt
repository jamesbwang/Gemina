  In this article , three variables including laccase dose , 2,2 '- Azinobis- ( 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) ( ABTS) dose and pH were used to modeling of Direct Red 81 ( DR81) elimination from aqueous solutions by laccase-mediated system. Obtained data indicated that the predicted and experimental values were close for DR81 elimination , and the regression was also able to give a good prediction of response for DR81 elimination (
