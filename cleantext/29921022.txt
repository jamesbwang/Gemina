  Currently there are more than 2,000 children on the transplant waiting list-and more than 100,000 Americans nationwide-awaiting a matching organ. Most children aged one through 10 are awaiting a kidney , liver , or heart. As with any transplant , there are two ways to find an organ-someone can donate or someone can die. Unfortunately , the supply falls far short of the demand , leaving people to die every day waiting for a second chance at life. Scientific and medical experts , however , continue to develop promising technology like 3D bioprinting that could save thousands of lives without the need of a donor.
