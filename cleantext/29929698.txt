  Post-operative rehabilitation and weight-bearing protocols are important to fracture fixation outcomes , yet there is a dearth in the literature concerning universal treatment guidelines following plate fixation of extremity fractures. There are controversies regarding time to allow weight-bearing and range of motion for most fractures of the upper and lower extremity. This lack of a consensus has led to varying practice guidelines and differing anecdotal protocols between treating surgeons. This review attempts to establish consensus guidelines for the post-operative rehabilitation required for patients following plate fixation of common upper and lower extremity fractures.
