  Two new sesquiterpenoids , curkwangsien A-B ( 1-2) , and seven known compounds ( 3-9) were isolated from rhizomes of Curcuma kwangsiensis. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis , and the absolute configurations of compounds 1-2 were determined by the quantum chemical ECD calculations. Compounds 3-9 are firstly reported from this plant. In the in vitro assays , compound 3 was found to inhibit human colon cancer RKO cell migration in time-dependent manner.
