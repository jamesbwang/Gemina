  Although the precise mechanism is unknown , neuron apoptosis is believed to participate in neuropathy caused by acrylamide ( ACR). Telomerase reverse transcriptase ( TERT) exhibits an anti-apoptotic function , but its contribution to the pathogenesis of ACR neurotoxicity is unclear. We investigated adult male rats that were given 30 , 40 and 50 mg/kg ACR three times/week for 4 weeks. We found that ACR treatment caused significant deficits in sensory/motor function as measured by gait score , landing foot spread distance , movement initiation test and tail immersion test. Histological examination showed that the cerebral cortex in all ACR treated animals exhibited fewer neurons and more condensed nuclei than normal cortex. A significant increase in apoptosis was found in the cerebral cortex of rat brains subjected to ACR treatment in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of TERT in the brain was significantly reduced by ACR treatment. The pro-apoptotic cleaved caspase-3 protein level was increased , while the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein level was decreased by 30- 50 mg/kg ACR. Our findings indicate that TERT and its downstream regulators of neuron apoptosis , including Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 , were involved in ACR neurotoxicity.
