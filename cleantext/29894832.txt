  The modification of magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs) via different routes for biomolecule binding is an attractive area of research. Waterborne thiol-ene suspension photopolymerization ( TESP) can be a useful method for preparing functional MNPs. In this study , for the very first time waterborne TESP was performed in the presence of MNPs. Neat MNPs were coated and in situ functionalized with amine groups by using thiol-ene chemistry. Engrailed-2 ( EN2) protein , a potential biomarker for various cancers such as prostate cancer , bladder cancer , breast cancer and ovarian cancer , is known to be a strong binder to a specific DNA sequence ( 50-TAATTA-30) to regulate transcription. Anti-EN2 antibodies were immobilized onto these MNPs by physical adsorption and covalent bonding methods , respectively. The amount of the physically immobilized antibodies ( 0.54 mg/g) were found to be lower than the loading of the covalently bonded antibodies ( 1.775 mg/g). The biomarker level in the artificial solutions prepared was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Coated MNPs were characterized by FTIR , TGA , SEM and STEM. After TESP , the average diameter of the neat magnetite nanoparticles increased from ∼ 15 nm to ∼ 32 nm.
