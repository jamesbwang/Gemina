  To evaluate the effect of the administration of phytoestrogens on obesity , type 2 diabetes , and liver-kidney toxicity. Phytoestrogens ( phyto ( E2)) were administrated to high fructose-fat diet ( HFFD). This study showed that administration of phyto ( E2) to HFFD-mice inhibited lipase activity by 34 % , decreased body<symptom> weight by 20 % and modulated lipid profile , showed a decrease in total-cholesterol ( TC) and LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C) rates in the plasma by 59 % and 42 % , respectively , and increased the HDL-cholesterol ( HDL-C) level by 31 %. In addition , the administration of phytoestrogens to HFFD-mice exerts an inhibitory effect on α-amylase activity and decreased glucose level by 28 % and increase in liver glycogen level by 33 %; and ameliorate oral glucose tolerance test. This study demonstrate that phyto ( E2) has both a promising potential with regards to the inhibition of intestinal lipase and α-amylase activities , and a valuable hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic function.
