  Social support is important for individual 's successful reentry; however , little is known about how it operates or is influenced by individual and structural factors. Understanding how social support matters for individuals convicted of a sex offense is especially important as they may have a different reentry experience due to the nature of their crime and post-conviction restrictions. This study examines the nature and effects of instrumental and expressive social support from family , friends , intimate partners , and parole officers on recidivism for a sample of men convicted of sex offenses using mixed methods. Results show that family , friend , and intimate partner support had no effects on recidivism , however participants reporting a positive relationship with their parole officer were more likely to return to prison. Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews sheds light on how the nature of these relationships might explain the social support-recidivism link in a high stakes population.
