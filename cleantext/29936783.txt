  Background: Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes ( TSG) is involved in development and progression of cancers. Re-expression of TSG is inversely proportionate with STAT3 signaling pathways. Demethylation of DNA by 5-Azacytidine ( 5-Aza) results in re-expression of silenced TSG. Forced expression of PRG2 by 5-Aza induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits BCR/ ABL tyrosine kinase resulting in hematological remission in CML patients. However , majority of CML patients treated with imatinib would develop resistance under prolonged therapy. Methods: CML cells resistant to imatinib were treated with 5-Aza and cytotoxicity of imatinib and apoptosis were determined by MTS and annexin-V , respectively. Gene expression analysis was detected by real time-PCR , STATs activity examined using Western blot and methylation status of PRG2 was determined by pyrosequencing analysis. Result: Expression of PRG2 was significantly higher in K562-R +5-Aza cells compared to K562 and K562-R ( p = 0.001). Methylation of PRG2 gene was significantly decreased in K562-R +5-Aza cells compared to other cells ( p = 0.021). STAT3 was inactivated in K562-R +5-Aza cells which showed higher sensitivity to imatinib. Conclusion: PRG2 gene is a TSG and its overexpression might induce sensitivity to imatinib. However , further studies are required to evaluate the negative regulations of PRG2 on STAT3 signaling.
