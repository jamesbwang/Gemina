  Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system. Defects in astrocyte function have been implicated in a variety of diseases. Cisplatin ( CDDP) is a chemotherapeutic drug that is widely used to treat various cancers. However , it causes neurocognitive impairment in patients. Little is known about the damaging effects of chemotherapeutic drugs like CDDP on astrocytes. Presently , we found that a low dose of CDDP distinctly inhibited astrocyte proliferation and induced delayed cell death. Additionally , the same low dose of CDDP suppressed the expression of autophagy-related molecules including LC3-II , SQSTM1/P62 , ATG5 , and ATG7. However , except for LC3-II , expression of the molecules recovered when the cells were subsequently cultured in CDDP-free medium. Analysis of autophagic flux using Ad-mRFP-GFP-LC3 transfection revealed reduced numbers of autophagosome and autolysosome puncta in low-dose CDDP-treated cells. These results indicate that the low-dose CDDP inhibited astrocyte growth and autophagy , the central nervous system cytotoxicity induced by CDDP needs to be further explored.
