  S100 calcium binding protein A4 ( S100A4) is a well‑established tumor metastasis mediator in various malignancies , including endometrial cancer ( EC). However , the regulatory mechanism underlying S100A4 expression remains elusive. In the present study , by analyzing public datasets and clinical samples , we found that estrogen‑related receptor γ ( ERRγ) was upregulated and positively correlated with S100A4 transcription in EC. ERRγ knockdown inhibited S100A4 expression and promoted the expression of its downstream target E‑cadherin , and vice versa. Mechanistic studies indicated that ERRγ enhanced the promoter activity of S100A4 to facilitate its transcription. In addition , knockdown of ERRγ suppressed migration and invasion of EC cells in vitro , while ectopic ERRγ expression promoted migration and invasion of EC cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Importantly , restoration of S100A4 expression prevented EC cells from undergoing ERRγ‑mediated changes in these biological features. In addition , synchronous changes in S100A4 and ERRγ expression were observed after incubation with estrogen. Overall , ERRγ may exert oncogenic activity mainly associated with aggressiveness of EC by activating S100A4 transcription and thus may be a novel therapeutic target in EC.
