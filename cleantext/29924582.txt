  Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) enables atomic-resolution characterization of the molecular structure and dynamics within complex heterogeneous samples , but it is typically insensitive. Dynamic nuclear polarization ( DNP) increases the NMR signal intensity by orders of magnitude and can be performed in combination with magic angle spinning ( MAS) for sensitive , high-resolution spectroscopy. Here we report MAS DNP experiments , for the first time , within intact human cells with > 40-fold DNP enhancement and a sample temperature of < 6 K. In addition to cryogenic MAS results at < 6 K , we also show in-cell DNP enhancements of 57-fold at 90 K. In-cell DNP is demonstrated using biradicals and sterically shielded monoradicals as polarizing agents. A novel trimodal polarizing agent is introduced for DNP , which contains a nitroxide biradical , a targeting peptide for cell penetration , and a fluorophore for subcellular localization with confocal microscopy. The fluorescent polarizing agent provides in-cell DNP enhancements of 63-fold at a concentration of 2.7 mM. These experiments pave the way for structural characterization of biomolecules in an endogenous cellular context.
