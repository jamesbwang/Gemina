  In transsphenoidal endoscopic cranial base surgery , a precise navigational support may be crucial. This is particularly evident in case of tumors extending to the parasellar region or in recurrent tumors whereas the normal anatomy has been altered by previous surgery/radiotherapy. Previous unsatisfactory experiences with a variety of navigation techniques in this type of surgery , encouraged us to perform an endoscopic endonasal approach with an OArm Â® ( Medtronic , Inc. , Minneapolis , MN) assisted technique for the surgical treatment of four patients affected respectively by an orbital tumor and three cases of relapse of non-functioning pituitary adenoma , and an one of them localized in the infrasellar-clival region. The system OArm-StealthStation allows to merge the intra-operative bone 3-D acquisition with the pre-operative CT/MRI imaging , and provides the surgeon with an extremely reliable operative navigational tool. This is the first report of an OArm-assisted endoscopic surgery for cranial base tumors. Here we report on the feasibility and usefulness of such a new application of the OArm: technical details , setting of the operating room , advantages and limits of the methodic are also described.
