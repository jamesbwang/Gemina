  Although the `` universal '' genetic code is now known not to be universal , and stop codons can have multiple meanings , one regularity remains , namely that for a given sense codon there is a unique translation. Examining CUG usage in yeasts that have transferred CUG away from leucine , we here report the first example of dual coding: Ascoidea asiatica<pathogen> stochastically encodes CUG as both serine and leucine in approximately equal proportions. This is deleterious , as evidenced by CUG codons being rare , never at conserved serine or leucine residues , and predominantly in lowly expressed genes. Related yeasts solve the problem by loss of function of one of the two tRNAs. This dual coding is consistent with the tRNA-loss-driven codon reassignment hypothesis , and provides a unique example of a proteome that can not be deterministically predicted. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
