  In the recent techno-scientific revolution , nanotechnology has gained popularity at a rapid pace in different sectors and disciplines , specifically environmental , sensing , bioenergy , and agricultural systems. Controlled , easy , economical , and safe synthesis of nanomaterials is desired for the development of new-age nanotechnology. In general , nanomaterial synthesis techniques , such as chemical synthesis , are not completely safe or environmentally friendly due to harmful chemicals used or to toxic by-products produced. Moreover , a few nanomaterials are present as by-product during washing process , which may accumulate in water , air , and soil system to pose serious threats to plants , animals , and microbes. In contrast , using plants for nanomaterial ( especially nanoparticle) synthesis has proven to be environmentally safe and economical. The role of plants as a source of nanoparticles is also likely to expand the number of options for sustainable green renewable energy , especially in biorefineries. Despite several advantages of nanotechnology , the nano-revolution has aroused concerns in terms of the fate of nanoparticles in the environment because of the potential health impacts caused by nanotoxicity upon their release. In the present panoramic review , we discuss the possibility that a multitudinous array of nanoparticles may find applications convergent with human welfare based on the synthesis of diverse nanoparticles from plants and their extracts. The significance of plant-nanoparticle interactions has been elucidated further for nanoparticle synthesis , applications of nanoparticles , and the disadvantages of using plants for synthesizing nanoparticles. Finally , we discuss future prospects of plant-nanoparticle interactions in relation to the environment , energy , and agriculture with implications in nanotechnology.
