  Although an automatic parking system has been installed in many vehicles recently , it is still hard for the system to confirm by itself whether a vacant parking area truly exists or not. In this paper , we introduced a robust vision-based vacancy parking area detecting method for both indoor and outdoor environments. The main contribution of this paper is given as follows. First , an automatic image stitching method is proposed. Secondly , the problem of environment illuminating change and line color difference is considered and solved. Thirdly , the proposed algorithm is insensitive to the shadow and scene diversity , which means the detecting result satisfies most of the environment. Finally , a vehicle model is considered for tracking and reconfirming the detecting results to eliminate most of the false positives.
