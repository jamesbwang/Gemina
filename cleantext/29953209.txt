  One of the most important aspects in controlling colloidal deposition is manipulating the homogeneity of the deposit by avoiding the coffee-ring effect caused by capillary flow inside the droplet during drying. After our previous work where we achieved homogeneous deposition of cellulose nanocrystals ( CNCs) from a colloidal suspension by reinforcing Marangoni flow over the internal capillary flow ( Gen√ßer et al.. Langmuir 2017 , 33 ( 1) , 228-234) , we now set out to reduce the importance of capillary flow inside a drying droplet by inducing gelation. In this paper , we discuss the effect of gelation on the deposition pattern and on the self-assembly of CNCs during droplet drying. CNC films were obtained by drop casting CNC suspensions containing NaCl and CaCl
