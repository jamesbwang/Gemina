  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) screening uptake is suboptimal , despite national efforts to increase screening rates. Behavioral economic approaches such as changing defaults may increase participation. We compare response rates to opt-in or opt-out messaging in mailed fecal immunochemical test ( FIT) outreach. This is a two-arm randomized controlled trial among 314 patients aged 50-74 years who had at least two primary care visits in the 2-year pre-enrollment period and were screening-eligible but not up-to-date. Eligible patients received invitation by electronic health record ( EHR) portal or mail with randomization to receive mailed FIT: ( 1) only if they actively opted-in to do so ( opt-in) or ( 2) unless they opted-out of screening ( opt-out). The primary outcome was FIT completion rate within 3 months of initial outreach. Patients randomized to opt-in agreed to participate 23.1 % of the time , and only 2.5 % of those in opt-out chose not to participate. FIT kits were mailed to 22.4 % and 93 % of patients in opt-in and opt-out arms , respectively. In intention-to-screen analysis , patients in the opt-out arm had a higher FIT completion rate ( 29.1 %) than in the opt-in arm ( 9.6 %) ( absolute difference 19.5 %; 95 % confidence interval , 10.9-27.9 %; P < .001). Results were similar in subgroup analysis of those sent initial messaging through the EHR portal ( 9.5 % opt-in versus 37.5 % in opt-out). Mailed CRC screening outreach providing an option to opt-out had significantly higher participation rates than opt-in messaging. Opt-out messaging approaches can boost participation in population health outreach efforts.
