  The ability to build progressively on the achievements of earlier generations is central to human uniqueness , but experimental investigations of this cumulative cultural evolution lack real-world complexity. Here , we studied the dynamics of cumulative culture using a large-scale data set from online collaborative programming competitions run over 14 years. We show that , within each contest population , performance increases over time through frequent ` tweaks ' of the current best entry and rare innovative ` leaps ' ( successful tweak: leap ratio = 16:1) , the latter associated with substantially greater variance in performance. Cumulative cultural evolution reduces technological diversity over time , as populations focus on refining high-performance solutions. While individual entries borrow from few sources , iterative copying allows populations to integrate ideas from many sources , demonstrating a new form of collective intelligence. Our results imply that maximising technological progress requires accepting high levels of failure.
