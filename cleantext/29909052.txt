  The Mini<pathogen> Sarcopenia Risk Assessment ( MSRA) , a new sarcopenia screening tool , has 2 versions: MSRA-7 ( full version , 7 items) and MSRA-5 ( short version , 5 items). We aimed to compare the diagnostic values of MSRA-7 and MSRA-5 to SARC-F for screening sarcopenia. A diagnostic accuracy study. A community in Chengdu , China. Older adults. Muscle mass , strength , and physical performance were tested using a bioimpedance analysis ( BIA) device , handgrip strength , and walking speed , respectively. Using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia ( AWGS) criteria as the gold standard , the sensitivity/specificity analyses of the 3 scales were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curves and area under the ROC curves ( AUC) were used to compare the overall diagnostic accuracy of the 3 scales. We recruited 384 participants. Against the AWGS criteria , SARC-F had a sensitivity of 29.5 % and a specificity of 98.1 % , and the MSRA-7 had a sensitivity of 86.9 % and a specificity of 39.6 % , whereas the MSRA-5 had a sensitivity of 90.2 % and a specificity of 70.6 %. The AUCs of SARC-F , MSRA-7 , and MSRA-5 were 0.89 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.86-0.92) , 0.70 ( 95 % CI , 0.65-0.74) , and 0.85 ( 95 % CI , 0.81-0.89) , respectively. The differences in AUCs between SARC-F and MSRA-7 and in those between MSRA-7 and MSRA-5 were statistically significant ( P < .001) , but the difference between SARC-F and MSRA-5 was not statistically significant ( P = .130). MSRA-5 may serve as a novel screening tool for sarcopenia in Chinese community-dwelling older adults. SARC-F , a class screening tool , is also suitable for this population. MSRA-5 and SARC-F demonstrated a similar diagnostic accuracy in our study population. MSRA-5 has better sensitivity , whereas SARC-F has better specificity. However , the diagnostic value of MSRA needs to be further validated in different populations.
