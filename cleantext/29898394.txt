  Hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) comprise a heterogeneous population exhibiting self-renewal and differentiation capabilities; however , the mechanisms involved in maintaining this heterogeneity remain unclear. Here , we show that SATB1 is involved in regulating HSC heterogeneity. Results in conditional Satb1-knockout mice revealed that SATB1 was important for the self-renewal and lymphopoiesis of adult HSCs. Additionally , HSCs from Satb1/Tomato-knockin reporter mice were classified based on SATB1/Tomato intensity , with transplantation experiments revealing stronger differentiation toward the lymphocytic lineage along with high SATB1 levels , whereas SATB1
