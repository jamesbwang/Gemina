  To optimize a self-assembly reaction , it is essential to understand the factors that govern its pathway. Here , we examine the influence of nucleation pathways in a model system for addressable , multicomponent self-assembly based on a prototypical `` DNA-brick '' structure. By combining temperature-dependent dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy with coarse-grained simulations , we show how subtle changes in the nucleation pathway profoundly affect the yield of the correctly formed structures. In particular , we can increase the range of conditions over which self-assembly occurs by using stable multisubunit clusters that lower the nucleation barrier for assembling subunits in the interior of the structure. Consequently , modifying only a small portion of a structure is sufficient to optimize its assembly. Due to the generality of our coarse-grained model and the excellent agreement that we find with our experimental results , the design principles reported here are likely to apply generically to addressable , multicomponent self-assembly.
