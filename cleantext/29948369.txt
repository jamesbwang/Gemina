  Vegan or vegetarian diets have been suggested to reduce type 2 diabetes ( T2D) risk. However , not much is known on whether variation in the degree of having a plant-based versus animal-based diet may be beneficial for prevention of T2D. We aimed to investigate whether level of adherence to a diet high in plant-based foods and low in animal-based foods is associated with insulin resistance , prediabetes , and T2D. Our analysis included 6798 participants ( 62.7 ± 7.8 years) from the Rotterdam Study ( RS) , a prospective population-based cohort in the Netherlands. Dietary intake data were collected with food-frequency questionnaires at baseline of three sub-cohorts of RS ( RS-I-1: 1989-1993 , RS-II-1: 2000-2001 , RS-III-1: 2006-2008). We constructed a continuous plant-based dietary index ( range 0-92) assessing adherence to a plant-based versus animal-based diet. Insulin resistance at baseline and follow-up was assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR). Prediabetes and T2D were collected from general practitioners ' records , pharmacies ' databases , and follow-up examinations in our research center until 2012. We used multivariable linear mixed models to examine association of the index with longitudinal HOMA-IR , and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models to examine associations of the index with risk of prediabetes and T2D. During median 5.7 , and 7.3 years of follow-up , we documented 928 prediabetes cases and 642 T2D cases. After adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors , a higher score on the plant-based dietary index was associated with lower insulin resistance ( per 10 units higher score: β = -0.09; 95 % CI:- 0.10;- 0.08) , lower prediabetes risk ( HR = 0.89; 95 % CI: 0.81; 0.98) , and lower T2D risk ( HR = 0.82 ( 0.73; 0.92)). After additional adjustment for BMI , associations attenuated and remained statistically significant for longitudinal insulin resistance ( β = -0.05 (- 0.06;- 0.04)) and T2D risk ( HR = 0.87 ( 0.79; 0.99)) , but no longer for prediabetes risk ( HR = 0.93 ( 0.85; 1.03)). In conclusion , a more plant-based and less animal-based diet may lower risk of insulin resistance , prediabetes and T2D. These findings strengthen recent dietary recommendations to adopt a more plant-based diet.Clinical Trial Registry number and website NTR6831 , http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=6831.
