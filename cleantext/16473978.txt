  It is debatable whether treating multimorbid nursing home patients with antihypertensive drugs produces beneficial effects. Most cardiovascular guidelines promote treatment; few have advice on how to deprescribe when treatment may no longer be necessary. We investigated the effect of medication review on antihypertensive drug use and the association between cognition , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and prescribing. From August 2014 to December 2015 , 765 patients from 72 units ( clusters) in 32 Norwegian nursing homes were included in a 4-month , multicentre , cluster-randomized , controlled trial , with 9-month follow-up. Patients ≥ 65 years old with antihypertensive treatment ( At baseline , each patient used 9.2 ± 3.5 regular drugs , and 1.6 ± 0.7 antihypertensives. Mean blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was 128/71 mmHg and 9 % had a systolic pressure ≥ 160 mmHg. Between baseline and month four , antihypertensives were deprescribed to a significantly higher extent in the intervention group ( A systematic medication review supported by collegial mentoring significantly decreased the use of antihypertensive drugs in nursing home patients without an effect on the systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> over time.
