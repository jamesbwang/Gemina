  To investigate the effect of sevoflurane on cognitive function and inflammatory response of children after general anesthesia at different times. Ninety-three pediatric patients who underwent general anesthesia surgery were enrolled and divided into groups based on time under general anesthesia: group A ( < 1 h , n = 27) , group B ( 1-3 h , n = 36) , and group C ( ≥ 3 h , n = 30). Changes in cognitive function and serum inflammatory index were compared. The occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD) in group A and B was lower than in group C and the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05). The levels of caspase-3 , TNF-α , and IL-6 in the POCD group at the different time points were significantly higher than in the non-POCD group and the differences were statistically significant ( p < 0.05). Caspase-3 , TNF-α , and IL-6 levels in the POCD group at the different time points significantly changed and were highest during the recovery period , while there were no significant changes in the non-POCD group at the different time points. The prolonged sevoflurane inhalational anesthesia time ( ≥ 3 h) enhanced the occurrence of POCD and was related to the expression levels of serum caspase-3 , TNF-α , and IL-6.
