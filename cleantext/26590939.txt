  The term vestibular paroxysmia ( VP) was introduced for the first time by Brandt and Dieterich in 1994. In 2016 , the Barany Society formulated the International Classification of VP , focusing in particular on the number and duration of attacks , on the differential diagnosis and on the therapy. Ephaptic discharges in the proximal part of the eighth cranial nerve , which is covered by oligodendrocytes , are assumed to be the neural basis of VP. We report the first case in literature of an onset of symptoms and signs typical of VP in a young man following acute unilateral vestibular loss not combined with auditory symptoms. Indeed , the pathogenic mechanism affected only the vestibular nerve as confirmed by the presence of a stereotyped nystagmus<symptom> pattern. The magnetic resonance imaging did n't reveal any specific cause therefore we suggest the possible role of a neuritis triggering an ephaptic discharge as the neural mechanism of VP.
