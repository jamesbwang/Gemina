  Patients with multiple actinic keratoses ( AKs) should be treated with field-directed therapy. Such treatments challenge patients ' adherence due to out-of-pocket costs , length of treatment and severity of local skin reactions ( LSRs). Effective physician-patient communication ( PPC) may buffer therapy-related distress , thus improving quality of life , treatment satisfaction and adherence. We evaluated the interplay between PPC , LSR intensity ( safety) and lesion<symptom> clearance rates ( effectiveness) on treatment satisfaction , quality of life and treatment adherence among patients with multiple AKs receiving topical field-directed therapies. In this observational , multicentre , longitudinal , cohort study , we included 1136 adult patients with discrete , clinically detectable , visible , multiple ( three or more lesions<symptom> in a 25 cm Communication clarity was associated with patient-reported outcomes and adherence beyond AK-related clinical parameters. Our study questions the current episodic approach to AK management and provides the rationale to develop chronic care models fostering patients ' engagement and treatment alliance.
