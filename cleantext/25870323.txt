  Candidemia epidemiology varies significantly by region; thus , local data are essential for evidence-based decision-making in prophylaxis and treatment. Current management strategies are derived from large randomized controlled trials mostly executed in large high-volume tertiary care centers. Results may not be entirely transferable to smaller hospitals. This study investigates epidemiology , diagnosis , and treatment standards in six hospitals in the Cologne metropolitan area ( number of inhabitants approx. one million). We assessed adherence to the current guideline of the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious<pathogen> Diseases<pathogen> ( ESCMID) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America ( IDSA) using the EQUAL Candida<pathogen> Score of the European Confederation of Medical Mycology ( ECMM). Data were documented by trained medical students as part of an integrated research and teaching concept at the University of Cologne. Between January 2014 and June 2017 , 77 patients had candidemia , corresponding to an incidence of 0.2 cases/1000 admissions. While 55 patients were enrolled , 22 patients were excluded due to incompletely retrievable health records. Fluconazole monotherapy was the preferred first-line treatment in cases with Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> infection ( 21/29). A central vascular catheter was present in 40 patients and was removed in 17 ( 43 %) during treatment. Overall mortality at 30 days was 44 %. Patients reached a mean EQUAL Candida<pathogen> Score of 9.9 ( range 8-14) , which was well below the maximum score of 22 for perfect guideline adherence. In summary , management of candidemia differed from current European recommendations. It remains unclear to what extent enhanced adherence would improve patient outcome. Larger prospective studies need to answer that question.
