  Solar ultraviolet radiation is the primary risk factor for skin cancers and sun-related eye disorders. Estimates of individual ambient ultraviolet irradiance derived from ground-based solar measurements and from satellite measurements have rarely been compared. Using self-reported residential history from 67,189 persons in a nationwide occupational US radiologic technologists cohort , we estimated ambient solar irradiance using data from ground-based meters and noontime satellite measurements. The mean distance-moved from city of longest residence in childhood increased from 137.6 km at ages 13-19 to 870.3 km at ages â‰¥ 65 , with corresponding increases in absolute latitude-difference moved. At ages 20/40/60/ 80 , the Pearson/Spearman correlation coefficients of ground-based and satellite-derived solar potential ultraviolet exposure , using irradiance and cumulative radiant-exposure metrics , were high ( = 0.87-0.92). There was also moderate correlation ( Pearson/Spearman correlation coefficients = 0.51-0.60) between irradiance at birth and at last-known address , for ground-based and satellite data. Satellite-based lifetime estimates of ultraviolet radiation were generally 14-15 % lower than ground-based estimates , albeit with substantial uncertainties , possibly because ground-based estimates incorporate fluctuations in cloud and ozone , which are incompletely incorporated in the single noontime satellite-overpass ultraviolet value. If confirmed elsewhere , the findings suggest that ground-based estimates may improve exposure-assessment accuracy and potentially provide new insights into ultraviolet-radiation-disease relationships in epidemiologic studies.
