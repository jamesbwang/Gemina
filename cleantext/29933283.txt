  To review the literature guiding all aspects of the use of injectable corticosteroids for painful musculoskeletal conditions , with a focus on the treatment of athletes. An extensive search of the literature was completed including search terms of corticosteroid , steroid , athlete , and injection , among others. Additional articles were used after being identified from previously reviewed articles. Injections of corticosteroids for a variety of painful conditions of the extremities and the axial spine have been described. Numerous minor and major complications have been reported , including those with a high degree of morbidity. There is a dearth of published research on the use of corticosteroid injections in athletes , with most of the research on this topic focused on older , nonathlete populations. Generally , these injections are well tolerated and can provide short-term pain improvement with little or no long-term benefits. Corticosteroid injections should be used cautiously in athletes and only after a full consideration of the pharmacology , pathogenesis of disease , potential benefits , complications , factors specific to the athlete , and rules of athletic governing bodies. Corticosteroid injections are just one component of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan available to the physician providing care to athletes.
