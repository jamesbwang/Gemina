In India , over the last few years , there has been a steady growth in the interest for these procedures. A variety of FGCS procedures were performed on 76 patients from January 2012 to August 2016. The procedures performed were as follows: vaginal tightening , labia minoraplasty , labia majoraplasty , clitoral hood reduction , and hymenoplasty. Based on FSFI scores , labia minoraplasty was more valuable as a cosmetic procedure and vaginal tightening was associated with better sexual function after surgery. FGCS is no doubt in its infancy in India. However , there is a steady rise in the awareness and demand for these procedures. A combination of procedures to improve individual components leads to improved aesthetic and functional aspects of female genitalia.
