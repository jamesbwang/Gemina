  Nutrition imbalance is common in chronic kidney disease ( CKD) children. This study was to evaluate nutrition status of CKD children at different stages using bioimpedance analysis ( BIA) compared with anthropometric measurements. Fifty-five CKD children at III , IV , V stages and 19 age and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Fat , protein and mineral compositions monitored by BIA were analyzed together with anthropometric measurements including height , weight and body mass index ( BMI). Biochemical tests were checked in CKD children. Among the total CKD Children we recruited , 23.6 % , 10.9 % and 56.3 % were underweight , overweight/obesity and stunting respectively. BIA showed that 52.7 % , 70.9 % , 14.5 % and 40.0 % of total CKD children had protein reduction , fat reduction , fat enhancement and mineral reduction respectively. The growth retardation and nutrition reduction became remarkable at stages IV and V. About 65 % of nutrition reduction occurred in healthy-weight children. In the underweight and healthy-weight groups , fat reduction rates were higher than protein reduction rates. In overweight/obesity group , fat enhancement was most notable. Mineral reduction was less remarkable. The nutrition imbalance in CKD children assessed by BIA correlated well with anthropometric measurements and disease process , supporting BIA as a conjugated diagnosis tool.
