  This article uses a French case to explore the who , how , and why of satellite remote-sensing development and its transition towards routine utilization in the domain of ecosystems ecology. It discusses the evolution of a community of technology developers promoting remote-sensing capabilities ( mostly sponsored by the French space agency). They attempted to legitimate quality scientific practices , establish the authority of satellite remote-sensing data within academic institutions , and build a community of technology users. This article , hence , is intended to contribute to historical interest in how a community of users is constructed for a technological system.
