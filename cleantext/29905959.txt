  Positron emission tomography ( PET) imaging remains limited due to the cost associated with on-site production of short half-life , positron-emitting isotopes. In this work , we examine the use of a pulse line ion accelerator ( PLIA) to accelerate protons for single-dose PET isotope production. Time-domain electromagnetic field and particle-in-cell ( PIC) simulations were performed for a 1.5-m PLIA structure modeled in CST Microwave Studio and Particle Studio software. Scaled measurements from a kV ramp-pulse generator were incorporated into the simulations to accelerate a 1 A , 50 ns proton beam injected with initial kinetic energy of 100 keV. A uniform , 3 T , solenoidal magnetic field was used to provide external beam focusing. Electromagnetic fields and particle phase space were recorded with ns resolution for subsequent analysis. Applying a scaled 100 kV , 20 ns ramped voltage pulse to the PLIA input resulted in a travelling electric field wave inside the structure with accelerating gradient of 2.4 MV/m. The observed wave speed was 1.2 Ã— 10 Simulations performed in this work demonstrate the feasibility of using a PLIA structure to accelerate protons with MV/m level gradients. Combining several PLIA stages in series could allow for a low-cost accelerator suitable for dose-on-demand PET isotope production.
