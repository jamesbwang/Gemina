  Obesity can be defined as the adaptive response of organism facing chronic nutrient overflow. In this context , the adipose tissue ( AT) can expand , through increased adipocyte size and number , to function as the main energy-storing organ. However , over the course of obesity progression , the AT undergo continual remodeling , evolving into pathological alterations. It is now clear that pro-inflammatory cell accumulation favors local AT injury. More recently , we and others described excess levels of extracellular matrix ( ECM) and fibrosis<disease> in AT depots from obese individuals. In obese mice , targeting ECM-remodeling improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Therefore AT fibrosis<disease> represents a maladaptive mechanism contributing to obesity-related metabolic complications such as diabetes , cardiometabolic and liver diseases. Here , we review the current knowledge about obesity-induced adipose tissue remodeling and its local and systemic consequences.
