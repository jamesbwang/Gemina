  Lipoprotein ( a) ( Lp ( a)) is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease. However , there are limited data regarding the impact of Lp ( a) levels on the incidence and severity of endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotor response. A total of 2416 patients without significant coronary artery lesion<symptom> ( < 50 % stenosis) by coronary angiography and underwent acetylcholine ( ACh) provocation test were enrolled and categorized according to their serum Lp ( a) level into four quartile groups: less than 6.70 , 6.70-13.30 , 13.30-26.27 , and more than 26.27 mg/dl. The aim of this study is to estimate the incidence and severity of endothelium-dependent positive ACh provocation test in each group; moreover , to access the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events , the composite of total death , myocardial infarction , and de novo percutaneous coronary intervention were compared between the four groups up to 5 years. The group with higher Lp ( a) had a higher incidence of coronary heart disease , myocardial infarction , and peripheral arterial disease history. However , there was no difference among the four groups as regards the incidence of positive ACh provocation test , spasm severity , spasm extent , and location. However , at up to 5 years of clinical follow-up , the higher-Lp ( a) group showed higher total death , de novo percutaneous coronary intervention , recurrent angina , and total major adverse cardiovascular events compared with the lower-Lp ( a) groups. In our study , there was no relationship between the elevated Lp ( a) level and the vasospastic response to the intracoronary ACh provocation test; however , higher Lp ( a) levels were associated with poor clinical outcomes up to 5 years.
