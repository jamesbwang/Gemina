  The exceptional magnetic properties of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( SPIONs) make them promising materials for biomedical applications like hyperthermia<symptom> , drug targeting and imaging. Easy preparation of SPIONs with the controllable , well-defined properties is a key factor of their practical application. In this work , we report a simple synthesis of Ho-doped SPIONs by the co-precipitation route , with controlled size , shape and magnetic properties. To investigate the influence of the ions ratio on the nanoparticles & rsquo; properties , multiple techniques were used. Powder X-ray diffraction ( PXRD) confirmed the crystallographic structure , indicating formation of an Fe ₃ O ₄ core doped with holmium. In addition , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) confirmed the correlation of the crystallites & rsquo; shape and size with the experimental conditions , pointing to critical holmium content around 5 % for the preparation of uniformly shaped grains , while larger holmium content leads to uniaxial growth with a prism shape. Studies of the magnetic behaviour of nanoparticles show that magnetization varies with changes in the initial Ho
