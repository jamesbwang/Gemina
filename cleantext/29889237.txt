  The appearance of multicellular animals during the Neoproterozoic Era is thought to have coincided with oxygenation of the oceans , however we know little about the physiological needs of early animals or about the environment they lived in. Approaches using biomarkers , fossils , and phylogenomics have provided some hints of the types of animals that may have been present during the Neoproterozoic , but extant animals are our best modern links to the theoretical ancestors of animals. Neoproterozoic oceans were low energy habitats , with low oxygen concentrations and sparse food availability for the first animals. We examined tolerance of extant ctenophores and sponges- as representatives of extant lineages of the earliest known metazoan groups- to feeding and oxygen use. A review of respiration<symptom> rates in species across several phyla suggests that suspension feeders in general have a wide range of metabolic rates , but sponges have some of the highest of invertebrates and ctenophores some of the lowest. Our own studies on the metabolism of two groups of deep water sponges show sponges have different approaches to deal with the cost of filtration and low food availability. We also confirmed that deep water sponges tolerate periods of hypoxia , but at the cost of filtration , indicating that normal feeding is energetically expensive. Predictions of oxygen levels in the Neoproterozoic suggest the last common ancestor ( LCA) of multicellular animals was unlikely to have filtered like modern sponges. Getting enough food at low oxygen would have been a more important driver of the evolution of early body plans.
