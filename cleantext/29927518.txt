  Automated computer-guided diagnostic procedures are increasingly being integrated into patient care. However , in contrast to the increasing application of automation , patient acceptance and trust in such technologies has rarely been studied. Automated diagnosis of melanoma with dermatofluoroscopy was recently approved by regulatory agencies. The objective of this study is to assess patient acceptance and trust in automated melanoma diagnosis with dermatofluoroscopy. We examined 140 pigmented skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> with dermatofluoroscopy as part of a prospective clinical study. Four weeks after their examination with dermatofluoroscopy , we contacted 100 patients with a 10-item questionnaire addressing their acceptance and trust in this technology on a five-point visual analogue scale. A `` high '' to `` very high '' level of patient acceptance and trust in dermatofluoroscopy was found in 74 % of responders. Most patients agreed that computer-assisted diagnoses are trustworthy and may generally improve the diagnostic performance of physicians. However , all responders insisted on the interpretation of computer-assisted diagnoses by a physician and frequently rejected the idea of computers completely replacing physicians. Patient acceptance and trust in dermatofluoroscopy was high. Patients clearly supported the use of automated , computer-assisted diagnostics as an adjunct to the physicians ' examination.
