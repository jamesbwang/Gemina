  Conservative management of penetrating renal trauma is emerging , with data originating from centers with variable level of trauma care. This study reviews the outcomes of renal salvage after penetrating trauma at a level I trauma center. An institutional review board approved trauma registry at Saint Louis University Hospital was retrospectively analyzed , for patients with penetrating renal trauma from 2009 to 2014. Patients were divided into nephrectomy group ( NG) or non-nephrectomy group ( non-NG) , and compared. A multi-variable analysis was performed to determine predictors of nephrectomy , with cross validation to evaluate the performance of the multi-variable model. Data was analyzed using R version 3.3.2. A p value of < 0.05 was considered as significant. A total of 121 patients were identified with penetrating renal trauma. Gunshot injury was the leading cause of injury ( 87 %). Eighteen ( 15 %) patients required nephrectomy. The overall mean injury severity score ( ISS). was 20. High grade ( grade 4-5) renal injuries were noted in 41 patients ( 34 %). Among these , 14 patients ( 34 %) underwent a nephrectomy , while 27 patients ( 66 %) were managed conservatively to salvage renal units. CT grade of renal injury was the only predictor of nephrectomy , on multi-variable analysis ( OR 17.09 CI 2.75-105.99 , p = 0.002). CT grade of injury and injury severity score were predictors of endoscopic intervention on a sub group analysis of non-NG. CT grade of injury predicts nephrectomy after penetrating renal trauma. Conservative management is a feasible option in penetrating renal trauma even with a higher grade of injury.
