  Short chain fatty acids ( SCFA) are produced by the gut microbiota during the fermentation of non-digestible polysaccharides. Diet is a major factor driving the composition and metabolism of the colonic microbiota. The aim of our study was to examine how a fat-rich and cholesterol-rich diet that , which leads to many metabolic disorders , affects the SCFA profile and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) concentration. The experiment was carried out on 72 male , 8-weeks-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The study group ( n = 30 rats) received high-fat and high cholesterol diet ( HFHCh). The control group ( n = 30) received standard food for laboratory rats. The rats from study and control groups were sacrificed after 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 and 20 weeks after start of dietary exposure. The analysis of SFA in feces was performed using gas chromatography ( Agilent Technologies 1260 A GC). The exposure to high-fat and high-cholesterol diet was associated with significant changes in SCFA levels. Relative to the control , each of HFHCh subgroup revealed a statistically significant decrease in butyrate ( 12.5 % ± 5.7 % versus 32.8 % ± 9.1 %) and an increase in propionate level ( 45.4 % ± 6.2 % versus 19.14 % ± 7.1 %). The ratio of acetate: propionate: butyrate was also changed ( from 1.1: 0.6: 1 for control groups to 3: 3,6: 1 for HFHCh groups). The main SCFA in the HFHCh group was propionate instead of acetate. The dietary exposure resulted in significant differences in LPS concentration. After 12 weeks of HFD exposure , LPS concentration was significantly higher compared to control groups ( P < 0.05). Our study showed that HFHCh diet affected butyrate and propionate production associated with an increase in LPS secretion. The hypothesis that observed changes could result in intestinal imbalance secondary to gut barrier dysfunction requires further studies.
