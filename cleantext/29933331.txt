  Simulation exercises can be used to provide poverty-related content that might be lacking in traditional clinical settings. A descriptive qualitative study design was used to examine the use of a poverty simulation in mental health nursing. Thematic analysis of reflective journals indicated students viewed the poverty simulation as a positive , realistic , and informative learning experience; had a better understanding of how poverty impacts health; and expressed changes in attitudes toward providing care. Results from this study suggest poverty simulations can be used to illustrate key concepts taught in mental health nursing , including empathy , advocacy , and refrainment from judging patients.
