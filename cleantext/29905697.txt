  Accurate and rapid particle tracking is essential for addressing many research problems in single molecule and cellular biophysics and colloidal soft condensed matter physics. We developed a novel three-dimensional interferometric fluorescent particle tracking approach that does not require any sample scanning. By periodically shifting the interferometer phase , the information stored in the interference pattern of the emitted light allows localizing particles positions with nanometer resolution. This tracking protocol was demonstrated by measuring a known trajectory of a fluorescent bead with sub-5 nm axial localization error at 5 Hz. The interferometric microscopy was used to track the RecA protein in Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> bacteria to demonstrate its compatibility with biological systems.
