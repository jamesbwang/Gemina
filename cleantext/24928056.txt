  Pre-term birth is a major health care challenge throughout the world , and preterm labor represents a potentially reversible component of this problem. Current tocolytics do not improve preterm labor beyond 48 h. We have previously shown that anoctamin 1 ( ANO1) channel blockade results in relaxation of pre-contracted human uterine smooth muscle ( USM). Three drug classes with reported medicinal effects in humans also have members with ANO1 antagonism. In this study , we compared the ability of representatives from these 3 classes to reduce human USM contractility and excitability. This study sought to examine the comparative potency of 3 ANO1 antagonists on pregnant human USM relaxation , contraction frequency reduction , inhibition of intracellular calcium release and membrane hyperpolarization. Experiments were performed using: 1) Ex vivo organ bath ( human pregnant tissue) , 2) Oxytocin-induced calcium flux ( in vitro human USM cells) and 3) Membrane potential assay ( in vitro human USM cells). Benzbromarone ( BB) demonstrated the greatest potency among the compounds tested with respect to force , frequency inhibition , reducing calcium elevation and depolarizing membrane potential. While all 3 ANO1 antagonists attenuate pregnant human uterine tissue contractility and excitability , BB is the most potent tocolytic drug. Our findings may serve as a foundation for future structure-function analyses for novel tocolytic drug development.
