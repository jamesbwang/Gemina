  An increased von Willebrand factor propeptide ( VWFpp) to VWF antigen ( VWF: Ag) ratio ( VWFpp/VWF: Ag) indicates an enhanced clearance of VWF. This finding has been described in von Willebrand disease ( VWD) and in acquired von Willebrand syndrome<disease> ( AVWS). A distinction between these two diseases , one congenital and the other acquired , is primarily based on family and personal history of bleeding. However , if this information is scanty , the diagnosis might be challenging due to the lack of an effective diagnostic biomarker. In this cross-sectional study , we assessed the ability of VWFpp/VWF: Ag for the differential diagnosis between VWD and AVWS. VWFpp/VWF: Ag was measured in a group of 153 patients ( 125 with VWD and 28 with AVWS). Most patients with AVWS and VWD showed an increased VWFpp/VWF: Ag , although to variable degrees. A marked increase of VWFpp/VWF: Ag was mainly associated with the diagnosis of AVWS and VWD type 1 Vicenza. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify the optimal cutoff of VWFpp/VWF: Ag for discrimination of patients with a modestly increased ( most VWD cases) versus those with a markedly increased clearance ( AVWS and VWD type 1 Vicenza) , and this cutoff was identified at the value of 3.9 ( sensitivity: 0.70 , specificity: 0.97). The ROC curve sorting from a logistic model containing VWFpp/VWF: Ag , age , and sex had an area under the curve ( AUC) of 0.88 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.80-0.95). A subsequent molecular evaluation discriminated VWD type 1 Vicenza from AVWS. In conclusion , VWFpp/VWF: Ag appears helpful to discriminate patients with a markedly increase VWF clearance ( AVWS or VWD type 1 Vicenza) from those with a modestly increased clearance ( most VWD patients).
