  The heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD) makes it difficult for school-based professionals to develop effective Individual Education Plans ( IEP) for this group. Limited research exists on the quality of IEP programs for individuals with ASD. This article summarizes the results of a retrospective chart review from an outpatient diagnostic center. Researchers collected data from IEPs and subsequent psychological evaluations of 75 individuals diagnosed with ASD. The implications of these results for future research and practice are discussed.
