  Historically , the US military has utilized centralized store-and-forward ( S&F) telemedicine programs for health care providers in remote locations worldwide. In the civilian community , new methods and platforms for teledermatology have been created based largely on those used by the military to maximize access to and the efficiency of health care , including secure direct-to-consumer ( DTC) mobile applications for patients , live interactive methods , and integrated S&F platforms for dermatology services within electronic health record ( EHR) systems. By incorporating similar innovative teledermatology methods and platforms , the US military health care system may benefit from increased accessibility and productivity.
