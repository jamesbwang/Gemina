  The goal of the 2017 North American Menopause Society Hormone Therapy ( HT) Position Statement is to remove fear about HT and encourage individualized shared decision making , using best available evidence. Systemic HT is safe and effective for symptomatic menopausal women aged younger than 60 years and within 10 years of menopause. Special populations of early menopause , high risk for fracture , risk of breast or uterine cancer , and extended duration are discussed. With longer duration of use , periodic evaluation and reassessment of health risks are needed. Lowered doses , transdermal therapies or newer options may enhance the benefit: risk ratio for HT.
