  The Academic Research Consortium ( ARC) -2 initiative revisited the clinical and angiographic end point definitions in coronary device trials , proposed in 2007 , to make them more suitable for use in clinical trials that include increasingly complex lesion<symptom> and patient populations and incorporate novel devices such as bioresorbable vascular scaffolds. In addition , recommendations for the incorporation of patient-related outcomes in clinical trials are proposed. Academic Research Consortium-2 is a collaborative effort between academic research organizations in the United States and Europe , device manufacturers , and European , US , and Asian regulatory bodies. Several in-person meetings were held to discuss the changes that have occurred in the device landscape and in clinical trials and regulatory pathways in the last decade. The consensus-based end point definitions in this document are endorsed by the stakeholders of this document and strongly advocated for clinical trial purposes. This Academic Research Consortium-2 document provides further standardization of end point definitions for coronary device trials , incorporating advances in technology and knowledge. Their use will aid interpretation of trial outcomes and comparison among studies , thus facilitating the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of these devices.
