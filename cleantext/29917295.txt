  Although histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi) alone could be clinically useful , these are most recently used in combination with other anticancer agents in clinical trials for cancer treatment. Recently , we reported the anticancer activity of an HDAC6-selective inhibitor A452 toward various cancer cell types. This study aims to present a potent synergistic antiproliferative effect of A452/anticancer agent treatment in colorectal cancer cells ( CRC) cells , independently of the p53 status. A452 in combination with irinotecan , or SAHA is more potent than either drug alone in the apoptotic pathway as evidenced by activated caspase-3 and PARP , increased Bak and pp38 , decreased Bcl-xL , pERK , and pAKT , and induced apoptotic cells. Furthermore , A452 enhances DNA damage induced by anticancer agents as indicated by the increased accumulation of Î³H2AX and the activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk2. The silencing of HDAC6 enhances the cell growth inhibition and cell death caused by anticancer agents. In addition , A452 induces the synergistic suppression of cell migration and invasion. This study suggests a mechanism by which HDAC6-selective inhibition can enhance the efficacy of specific anticancer agents in CRC cells.
