  The purpose was to evaluate the clinical value of PETRA sequence for the diagnosis of internal derangement of the knee. The major structures of the knee in 34 patients were evaluated and compared among conventional MRI findings , PETRA images , and arthroscopic findings. The specificities of PETRA with 2D FSE sequence were higher for meniscal lesions<symptom> than those obtained when using 2D FSE alone. Using PETRA images along with conventional 2D FSE images can increase the accuracy of assessing internal derangements of the knee and , specifically , meniscal
