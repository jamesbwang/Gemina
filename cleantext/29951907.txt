  In the brain , networks of neurons produce activity that is decoded into perceptions and actions. How the dynamics of neural networks support this decoding is a major scientific question. That is , while we understand the basic mechanisms by which neurons produce activity in the form of spikes , whether these dynamics reflect an overlying functional objective is not understood. In this paper , we examine neuronal dynamics from a first-principles control-theoretic viewpoint. Specifically , we postulate an objective wherein neuronal spiking activity is decoded into a control signal that subsequently drives a linear system. Then , using a recently proposed principle from theoretical neuroscience , we optimize the production of spikes so that the linear system in question achieves reference tracking. It turns out that such optimization leads to a recurrent network architecture wherein each neuron possess integrative dynamics. The network amounts to an efficient , distributed event-based controller where each neuron ( node) produces a spike if doing so improves tracking performance. Moreover , the dynamics provide inherent robustness properties , so that if some neurons fail , others will compensate by increasing their activity so that the tracking objective is met.
