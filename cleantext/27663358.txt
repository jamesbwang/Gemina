  Prescription opioid medications continue to be abused on an epidemic level and have been shown to be a `` gateway '' drug to heroin abuse. Individuals experimenting with opioids commonly fall in the 10- to 19-year age range in which dentists are the highest prescribers. To reduce the number of excess opioids , the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery , University of Minnesota , developed and implemented an evidence-based opioid prescribing policy. Data were collected via electronic health record for the previous year and compared with the year following the protocol implementation. The results showed a drastic decrease ( > 46 %) in the number of prescriptions given over a 1-year period. All departments reported a decrease in opioid prescriptions and the average number of tablets per prescription. The concern of undertreating pain was not found to be significant , as there was no increase in after-hours calls , recall appointments , or documentable emergency room visits. The results support the efficacy of an opioid prescribing policy 's ability to lower the frequency and number of opioids given to patients , while still adequately treating patients ' pain. Continued evaluation and modifications of the protocol and close monitoring of prescriber habits will enhance patients ' pain control while also limiting the number of opioids available for abuse.
