  The aim of this study is to characterize the presence of exercise oscillatory ventilation ( EOV) and to relate it with other cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CET) responses and clinical variables. Forty-six male patients ( age: 53.1 ± 13.6 years old; left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF): 30 ± 8 %) with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> were recruited to perform a maximal CET and to correlate the CET responses with clinical variables. The EOV was obtained according to Leite et al. criteria and VE/VCO2 > 34 and peak VO2 < 14 ml/kg/min were used to assess patients ' severity. The EOV was observed in 16 of 24 patients who performed the CET , as well as VE/VCO2 > 34 and peak VO2 < 14 ml/kg/min in 14 and 10 patients , respectively. There was no difference in clinical and CET variables of the patients who presented EOV in CET when compared to non-EOV patients. Also , there was no difference in CET and clinical variables when comparing patients who presented EOV and had a VE/VCO2 slope > 34 to patients who just had one of these responses either. The present study showed that there was an incidence of patients with EOV and lower peak VO2 and higher VE/VCO2 slope values , but they showed no difference on other prognostic variables. As well , there was no influence of the presence of EOV on other parameters of CET in this population , suggesting that this variable may be an independent marker of worst prognosis in HF patients.
