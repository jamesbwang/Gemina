  Treatment of mechanical exposure of the pulp during caries<disease> excavation presents a clinical challenge. In this case series of 15 patients , with a follow-up period of over a year , the outcome of direct pulp capping with Biodentine ( septodont) after mechanical pulp exposure was assessed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of direct pulp capping with Biodentine in deeply carious teeth when pulp was mechanically exposed during caries<disease> excavation and cavity preparation. Vital pulps exposed during caries<disease> excavation in molar teeth were treated with 3 % sodium hypochlorite for 2 min. If adequate hemostasis was achieved , the pulp tissue was capped with Biodentine , which covered the entire pulpal floor. This was followed by the placement of a layer of resin-modified glass ionomer cement and a final layer of composite resin ( Filtek Z350-3M) to complete the restoration. The patients were recalled periodically and evaluated for any evidence of pulpal/periapical pathology. In the follow-up period that ranged from 12 to 24 months , all teeth were asymptomatic. Biodentine appears to be a suitable material for direct pulp capping under clinical conditions. However , long-term follow-up studies and controlled trials involving a large sample size are warranted.
