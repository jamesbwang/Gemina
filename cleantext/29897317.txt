  Veterinary students are challenged to develop new , nonlinear ways of thinking as they learn diagnostic reasoning skills. To support this process , we use real-life cases in our clinical pathology course. Changes in student perceptions regarding the use of cases and changes in study strategies over time have not been previously investigated or compared to student grades. Students participated in three voluntary online surveys that included 4-point Likert scale questions and open-ended questions on the helpfulness of cases for learning and study strategies used during the course. We used Friedman tests to detect any differences in perceptions over time; McNemar 's test and `` Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to detect any differences in study strategies over time. Fisher 's exact tests ` were used to examine the association between the Likert scale responses and grades in quartiles. Before beginning the course , 29 % of students responded that cases were very helpful to their learning , with similar `` responses for helpfulness in applying course material and grasping important concepts. There was a significant trend of increasing positivity over the duration of the course , with 74 % responding that cases were very helpful at the end of the course. The most-reported study strategy was working individually on cases before the midterm ( 74 % of students) , and the most helpful study strategy was attending class regularly ( 88 % reported it as very `` helpful). Study strategies did not change significantly over time. Overall , perceptions and study strategies did not vary significantly with grades.
