  The prevalence of overweight has substantially increased over the last decades despite the intent of health professionals and the general population to prevent this trend. Traditionally , this phenomenon has been attributed to unhealthy dietary macronutrient composition and/or to the decrease in physical activity participation. Beyond the influence of these factors , it is more than likely that other factors have influenced energy balance<symptom> in a context of modernity. These include inadequate sleep , demanding cognitive effort , chemical pollution , and probably others which also have the potential to promote a positive energy balance<symptom> but which are also part of the reality of success and productivity in a globalized world. As discussed in this paper , many individuals may become conflicted with themselves if they wish to prevent weight gain while influencing factors which are determinants of their socioeconomic success. In this regard , this paper reminds us of the contribution of adipose tissue gain in body homeostasis which is essential to permit energy balance<symptom> , especially under lifestyle conditions promoting overfeeding. From a clinical standpoint , this imposes the consideration of a weight<symptom> loss<symptom> program as a search for compromise between what can be changed to promote a negative energy balance<symptom> and what can be tolerated by the body in terms of fat loss. Furthermore , if we also consider the impact of pollution on energy balance<symptom> for which we currently do not hold solutions of reversibility , we probably must accept that the mankind of today will have to be more corpulent than its ancestors. In this pessimistic environment , there are still possibilities to do better; however , this will probably require the revisiting of lifestyle practices according to what the human body and planet can tolerate as deviation from optimal functioning.
