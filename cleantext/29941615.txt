  Maximal animal performance may be limited by the ability of animals to dissipate heat; the heat dissipation limitation ( HDL) theory. Since diets vary in the incidental heat produced during digestion ( specific dynamic action , SDA) , the HDL theory predicts lactating female mice consuming diets with lower SDA should have increased reproductive performance. Dietary fat has a lower SDA than dietary carbohydrate. Female mice were fed low ( LF) , medium ( MF) or high fat ( HF) diets ( 10 % , 45 % and 60 % energy from fat respectively) from days 4-18 of lactation. HF and MF-fed mice weaned significantly heavier litters than LF mice. This was because they not only consumed more energy ( metabolisable energy intake ,
