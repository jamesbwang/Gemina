  This research was conducted on two varieties of tender jackfruit ( hard ( HV) and soft variety ( SV)). The tender jackfruit was divided into four stages ( i.e. Stage 1 , 2 , 3 and 4) and their physical , mechanical , chemical and textural properties were determined for both the varieties. Physical properties like weight , length , diameter , geometric mean and arithmetic mean diameter were increases with increase in size for both the varieties. There was a significant increase in TSS in both the varieties ( HV: 1.5 ± 0.02 to 5.1 ± 0.03; SV: 2.7 ± 0.05 to 7.1 ± 0.05
