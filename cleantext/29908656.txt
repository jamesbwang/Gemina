  Kinematic assessments of the upper limb during activities of daily living ( ADLs) are used as an objective measure of upper limb function. The implementation of ADLs varies between studies; whilst some make use of props and define a functional target , others use simplified tasks to simulate the movements in ADLs. Simulated tasks have been used as an attempt to reduce the large movement variability associated with the upper limb. However , it is not known whether simulated tasks replicate the movements required to complete ADLs or reduce movement variability. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of simulated tasks in upper limb assessments in comparison to functional movements. Therefore answering the following questions: Do simulated tasks replicate the movements required of the upper limb<symptom> to perform functional activities? Do simulated tasks reduce intra- and inter-subject movement variability? Fourteen participants were asked to perform five functional tasks ( eat , wash , retrieve from shelf , comb and perineal care) using two approaches: a functional and a simulated approach. Joint rotations were measured using an optoelectronic system. Differences in movement and movement variability between functional and simulated tasks were evaluated for the thorax , shoulder , elbow/forearm and wrist rotations. Simulated tasks did not accurately replicate the movements required for ADLs and there were minimal differences in movement variability between the two approaches. The study recommends the use of functional tasks with props for future assessments of the upper limb.
