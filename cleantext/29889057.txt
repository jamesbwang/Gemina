  Traditional sit-up exercise is a simple method to strengthen core muscles. However , it can increase the potential of lumbar spine injury during the bending process. To evaluate the effect of assisted sit-up exercise ( SUE) using a new training device , HubEX-LEX , on strengthening core muscles and improving non-specific low back pain ( NSLBP) compared to conventional core stabilization exercise ( CSE). Subjects with chronic NSLBP were randomly divided into two groups: SUE ( n = 18) or CSE ( n = 18). They participated in 12 sessions of the exercise program. Before and after the training , thickness and activity of core muscles were measured using ultrasonogram and surface electromyography respectively. Pain and disability were assessed using two questionnaires. Thickness ratios ( contracted/rest) of rectus<pathogen> abdominis and external oblique in the SUE group and those of transversus abdominis in the CSE group showed statistically significant difference between before and after exercise ( p < 0.05). The ratio of activation of internal oblique relative to rectus<pathogen> abdominis and all measurements for pain and disability showed statistically significant improvement in both groups ( p < 0.05). Assisted SUE using new training device can be an effective therapeutic exercise to strengthen dynamic abdominal muscles and improve core muscle activation pattern in NSLBP patients.
