  A better understanding of molecular gastric cancer ( GC) entities may help in tailored treatments of that neoplasm. The PIK3CA mutation is one of the most important in many cancers. Objectives. We performed a comparison of clinical and pathological data of the PIK3CA mutation in GC patients. The analysis was done on 472 patients operated on in one center. Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) was used for the screening of PIK3CA ( exon 9 and 20). For microsatellite instability ( MSI) we used 5 quasi-monomorphic mononucleotide repeats- BAT-26 , BAT-25 , NR-24 , NR-21 , and NR-27. The clinical and pathological data was analyzed. PIK3CA mutation was observed in 10 out of 472 GC patients ( 2.1 %). Nine out of 10 were MSI ( 9 of 111 MSI patients- 8.1 %). Half of the 10 patients had mutations in exon 9 and the other half in exon 20. A majority of patients with the PIK3CA mutation had MSI ( p < 0.001). The 5-year survival of MSI patients with the PIK3CA mutation was 40 % and without the mutation , 70.4 % ( p = 0.309). For patients with the mutation in exon 9 , the 5-year survival was 0 % , and for those with the mutation in exon 20 , 80 % ( p = 0.031). The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis did not show that PIK3CA is statistically correlated with a worse overall survival. PIK3CA mutation in GC is a rare finding. It is strongly associated with the MSI molecular subgroup , presenting a worse outcome than other MSI patients. A completely different outcome is associated with the mutation in exon 9 compared to the mutation in exon 20 , with the latter being more favorable.
