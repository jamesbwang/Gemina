  1. 1-Aminobenzotriazole ( ABT) is a mechanism-based inactivator of major cytochrome P450 ( CYP) enzymes , which is used in multiple mechanistic studies. 2. The purpose was to evaluate the effect of 2 h and 16 h pretreatment regimens of ABT on the exposures of triazolam in rat. Another objective was to evaluate the effect of ABT on gastric emptying of acetaminophen. 3. Plasma area under the curve ( AUC) of triazolam was increased by 101-fold and 81-fold for the rats pre-treated with ABT at 2 h and 16 h , respectively , compared to control rats. Time to reach maximum concentration was 0.3 h , 4.8 h and 3.7 h in control , 2 h and 16 h pretreatment animals , respectively. In the case of acetaminophen , where T
