  Background Calgranulin C ( S100A12) is an innate immune peptide at the air-mucosal interface associated with neutrophil involvement , which when overexpressed has been implicated as a biomarker of inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. Decreased epithelial expression of certain innate immune peptides has been reported in chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS). We hypothesized that S100A12 is differentially expressed in the sinonasal mucosa of patients with CRS compared to controls and that S100A12 is a potential biomarker of CRS-specific quality of life ( QOL) and disease severity. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted which included 70 patients: 17 controls , 28 having CRS without ( CRSsNP) , and 25 with ( CRSwNP) nasal polyps. The expression of S100A12 and human neutrophil elastase ( HNE) was assessed in the anterior ethmoid tissues from all patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) and immunohistochemical ( IHC) analyses. Disease-specific QOL ( Rhinosinusitis Disability Index) and disease severity ( computed tomography ( CT) and endoscopy) were evaluated and correlated to the expression levels of S100A12. Results S100A12 and HNE were significantly elevated in patients with CRSsNP compared to normal controls ( P < .05 and P < .001 , respectively) and patients with CRSwNP ( P < .05 and P < .001 , respectively) , as measured by ELISA and IHC analyses. Patients with CRS exhibited worse CRS-specific disease severity compared to normal controls ( P < .05) , and the increased protein levels of S100A12 were significantly correlated to disease severity , represented by CT scores ( P < .05). Conclusions S100A12 is differentially expressed in CRS subtypes and is significantly elevated in patients with CRSsNP and associated with CRS-specific disease severity.
