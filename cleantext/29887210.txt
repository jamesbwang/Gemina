  A new species of Homo , Homo naledi , was described in 2015 based on the hominin skeletal remains from the Dinaledi Chamber of the Rising Star cave system , South Africa. Subsequent craniodental comparative analyses , both phenetic and cladistic , served to support its taxonomic distinctiveness. Here we provide a new quantitative analysis , where up to 78 nonmetric crown and root traits of the permanent dentition were compared among samples of H. naledi ( including remains from the recently discovered Lesedi Chamber) and eight other species from Africa: Australopithecus afarensis , Australopithecus africanus , Paranthropus boisei , Paranthropus robustus , Homo habilis , Homo erectus , Middle Pleistocene Homo sp. , and Pleistocene and Holocene Homo sapiens. By using the mean measure of divergence distance statistic , phenetic affinities were calculated among samples to evaluate interspecific relatedness. The objective was to compare the results with those previously obtained , to assess further the taxonomic validity of the Rising Star hominin species. In accordance with earlier findings , H. naledi appears most similar dentally to the other African Homo samples. However , the former species is characterized by its retention and full expression of features relating to the main cusps , as well as the root numbers , with a near absence of accessory traits-including many that , based on various cladistic studies , are plesiomorphic in both extinct and extant African hominins. As such , the present findings provide additional support for the taxonomic validity of H. naledi as a distinct species of Homo.
