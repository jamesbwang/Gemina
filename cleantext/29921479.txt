  The American Society of Echocardiography ( ASE) guidelines suggest the use of several echocardiographic methods to assess mitral regurgitation severity using an integrated approach , without guidance as to the weighting of each parameter. The purpose of this multicenter prospective study was to evaluate the recommended echocardiographic parameters against a reference modality and develop and validate a weighting for each echocardiographic measure of mitral regurgitation severity. This study included 112 patients who underwent evaluation with echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). Echocardiographic parameters recommended by the ASE were included and compared with MRI-derived regurgitant volume ( MRI-RV). Echocardiographic parameters that correlated best with MRI-RV were proximal isovelocity surface area ( PISA) radius ( r = 0.65 , P < .0001) , PISA-derived effective regurgitant orifice area ( r = 0.65 , P < .0001) , left ventricular end-diastolic volume ( r = 0.56 , P < .0001) , and PISA-derived regurgitant volume ( r = 0.52 , P < .0001). In the linear regression models PISA-derived effective regurgitant orifice area , PISA-derived regurgitant volume , left ventricular end-diastolic volume , and the presence of a flail leaflet independently predicted MRI-RV. Echocardiographic parameters of mitral regurgitation as recommended by the ASE had moderate correlations with MRI-RV. The best predictors of MRI-RV were PISA-derived effective regurgitant orifice area , PISA-derived regurgitant volume , left ventricular end-diastolic volume , and the presence of a flail leaflet , suggesting that these parameters should be weighted more heavily than other echocardiographic parameters in the application of the ASE-recommended integrated approach.
