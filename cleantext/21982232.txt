  Gastric Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 ( Lgr5) cells exert important functions during injury and homeostasis. Bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP) signaling regulates gastric inflammation<symptom> and epithelial homeostasis. We investigated if BMP signaling controls the fate of Lgr5 The None Inflammation<symptom> and inhibition of BMP signaling activate Lgr5
