  BACKGROUND To investigate the effect of the BMP/Smad signaling pathway on fracture healing and osteogenic ability in senile osteoporotic fracture on humans and rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-two patients and well-matched normal controls were enrolled for clinical observation. A rat model of senile osteoporotic fracture was established. Serum BMP2 and Smad4 levels , as well as alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) activity , were detected by ELISA. Fracture healing was observed by X-ray radiography and bone formation was analyzed by micro-CT. RESULTS Serum BMP2 and Smad4 levels in patients with senile osteoporotic fracture were significantly lower than those in normal controls ( all P < 0.01). BMP2 was highly positively correlated with Smad4 in patients with senile osteoporotic fracture ( r = 0.738). Compared with patients with low serum BMP2 and Smad4 levels , visual analog scale scores decreased , bone mineral density ( BMD) increased , and duration of fracture healing was shortened in patients with high levels ( all P < 0.05). Compared with the Model group , serum BMP2 and Smad4 levels increased , fracture healing was improved , BMD , trabecular bone volume ( TBV) , tissue volume ( TV) , bone volume fraction ( BV/TV) , mean trabecular thickness ( Tb. Th) , and mean number of trabecular bone ( Tb. N) were increased , and ALP activity increased in the BMP2 overexpression group ( all P < 0.05) , while each index in the NC group showed no statistical difference relative to rats in the Model group ( all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS BMP2 overexpression can promote fracture healing and osteogenic ability in senile osteoporotic fractures through activating the BMP/Smad signaling pathway.
