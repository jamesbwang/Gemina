  The most common complication after tonsillectomy is bleeding. We investigated whether performing the procedure during the summer or the winter affects the bleeding rate. To investigate whether there is an association between meteorological conditions and the occurrence of post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage<symptom> ( PTH) in the southern Israel Negev region. All patients who underwent tonsillectomy from 2001-2013 at the Soroka Medical Center were included. We collected patient demographic data and indications for surgery. Meteorological data were obtained from a weather station operated by the Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection. Of 4438 patients who underwent tonsillectomy , with or without adenoidectomy , 432 ( 9.73 %) experienced hemorrhage<symptom>. Patients who suffered from PTH were significantly older: median age 9.61 years vs. 4.7 years , P < 0.0001. When comparing patients without PTH to those who bled within 0-3 days after surgery , there was a higher risk for bleeding during the warmer seasons: relative risk ( RR) 1.38 , 95 % confidence interval ( ( 95 % CI) 1.07-1.77) , RR 1.45 ( 95 % CI 1.17-1.80) , and 1.62 ( 95 % CI 1.27-2.06) comparing the winter to spring , summer , and fall , respectively. A statistically significant positive association was also found with the average temperature on the day of surgery. Bleeding more than 3 days after surgery was less likely in summer: RR 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.69-0.97. We found no association with temperature on the day of surgery and PTH after postoperative day 3. Seasonality , and to an extent temperature , seem to play only a minor role in PTH.
