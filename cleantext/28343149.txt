  The myocyte enhancer factor 2 ( MEF2) regulates transcription in cardiac myocytes and adverse remodeling of adult hearts. Activators of G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs) have been reported to activate MEF2 , but a comprehensive analysis of GPCR activators that regulate MEF2 has to our knowledge not been performed. Here , we tested several GPCR agonists regarding their ability to activate a MEF2 reporter in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E
