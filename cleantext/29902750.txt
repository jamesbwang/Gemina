  To investigate the biological pathways involved in phthalate-induced developmental effects , zebrafish embryos were exposed to different concentrations of di- ( 2-ethylhexyl) ( DEHP) and di-butyl phthalate ( DBP) for 96 h. Embryonic exposure to DEHP and DBP induced body length decrease , yolk sac abnormities , and immune responses ( up-regulation of immune proteins and genes). The lipidomic results showed that at a concentration of 50 Î¼g/L , DEHP and DBP significantly reduced the levels of fatty acids , triglycerides , diacylglycerol , and cholesterol. These effects are partly explained by biological pathway enrichment based on data from the transcriptional and proteomic profiles. Co-exposure to DBP and ER antagonist did not significantly relieve the toxic symptoms compared with exposure to DBP alone. This indicates that phthalate-induced developmental abnormities in zebrafish might not be mediated by the ER pathway. In conclusion , we identified the possible biological pathways that mediate phthalate-induced developmental effects and found that these effects may not be driven by estrogenic activation.
