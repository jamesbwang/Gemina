  This is a retrospective , self-controlled cohort study , at a single center. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of sexual function after surgical treatment of single-level lumbar disk herniation ( LDH). The impact of surgical treatment on sexual activity is still unknown and not well researched. In total , 114 patients who underwent disk surgery for LDH between 2009 and 2015 were included in the study ( mean age , 46.9 y). Two separate questionnaires evaluating general health and all aspects of sexual function were administered to all patients. Satisfaction with the overall outcome of surgery was reported by 84.2 % of patients. In total , 82 patients ( 71.9 %) rated their current sexual life as normal with no additional pain , 22 ( 19.3 %) reported a normal sex life with some additional pain , and 2 reported that ( 2.6 %) pain prevents them from having any sex life at all. Compared with their state before LDH and spine surgery , 79 patients ( 69.3 %) rated their sexual function as quantitatively and qualitatively the same as before surgery , 19 patients ( 16.7 %) as better , and 16 patients ( 14.0 %) as worse. The ability to experience orgasm , complete intercourse , experience sexual desire , and experience sexual arousal was reported to be the same as before surgery by 87 ( 76.3 %) , 75 ( 65.8 %) , 79 ( 69.3 %) , and 85 ( 74.6 %) patients , respectively. After surgery , 16 patients ( 14 %) explored new sexual positions. Sexual function receives insufficient attention from physicians. Women reported more general and sexual problems such as decreased sexual desire and interest , taking medication , and seeking regular medical attention. Predictors of the outcome were leg<symptom> pain<symptom> , the intensity of back and leg<symptom> pain<symptom> , and the professional status of the patient. Lumbar disk surgery has a positive effect on sexual function. The majority of patients returned to their normal sexual activities in long-term follow-up.
