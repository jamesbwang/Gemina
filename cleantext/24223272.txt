  The Atlantic surfclam ( Spisula solidissima) is a commercially important species in North American waters , undergoing biological and ecological shifts. These are attributed , in part , to environmental modifications in its habitat and driven by climate change. Investigation of shell growth patterns , trace elements , and isotopic compositions require an examination of growth lines and increments preserved in biogenic carbonates. However , growth pattern analysis of S. solidissima is challenging due to multiple disturbance lines caused by environmental stress , erosion in umbonal shell regions , and constraints related to sample size and preparation techniques. The present study proposes an alternative method for describing chronology. First , we analyzed growth patterns using growth lines within the shell and hinge. To validate the assumption of annual periodicity of growth line formation , we analyzed the oxygen isotope composition of the outer shell layer of two specimens ( 46 ° 54 ' 20 `` N; 56 ° 18 ' 58 `` W). Maximum δ18Oshell values occurred at the exact same location as internal growth lines in both specimens , confirming that they are formed annually and that growth ceases during winter. Next , we used growth increment width data to build a standardized growth index ( SGI) time-series ( 25-year chronology) for each of the three parts of the shell. Highly significant correlations were found between the three SGI chronologies ( p < 0.001; 0.55 < τ < 0.68) of all specimens. Thus , ligament growth lines provide a new method of determining ontogenetic age and growth rate in S. solidissima. In a biogeographic approach , the shell growth performance of S. solidissima in Saint-Pierre and Miquelon was compared to those in other populations along its distribution range in order to place this population in a temporal and regional context.
