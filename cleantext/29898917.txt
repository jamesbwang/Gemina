  Somatic muscles are formed by the iterative fusion of myoblasts into muscle fibres. This process is driven by the recurrent recruitment of proteins to the cell membrane to induce F-actin nucleation at the fusion site. Although several proteins involved in myoblast fusion have been identified , knowledge about their subcellular regulation is rather elusive. We identified the anaphase-promoting complex ( APC/C) adaptor Fizzy related ( Fzr) as an essential regulator of heart and muscle development. We show that APC/C
