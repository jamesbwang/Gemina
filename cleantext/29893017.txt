  Glioblastoma is a most intractable and high-mortality malignancy because of its extremely low drug accessibility resulting from the blood-brain barrier ( BBB). Here , it is reported that angiopep-2-directed and redox-responsive virus-mimicking polymersomes ( ANG-PS) ( angiopep-2 is a peptide targeting to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 ( LRP-1)) can efficiently and selectively chaperone saporin ( SAP) , a highly potent natural protein toxin , to orthotopic human glioblastoma xenografts in nude mice. Unlike chemotherapeutics , free SAP has a low cytotoxicity. SAP-loaded ANG-PS displays , however , a striking antitumor activity ( half-maximal inhibitory concentration , IC
