  Triplex formation occurs via interaction of a third strand with the major groove of double-stranded nucleic acid , through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. In this work , we use a combination of temperature-dependent UV spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry to determine complete thermodynamic profiles for the unfolding of polyadenylic acid ( poly ( rA)) · polyuridylic acid ( poly ( rU)) ( duplex) and poly ( rA) · 2poly ( rU) ( triplex). Our thermodynamic results are in good agreement with the much earlier work of Krakauer and Sturtevant using only UV melting techniques. The folding of these two helices yielded an uptake of ions , Δ n
