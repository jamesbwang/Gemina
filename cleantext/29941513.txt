  Untreated obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) is common in patients with hypertension and may impair blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and target-organ damage responses to antihypertensive therapy. In this study , we recruited hypertensive patients who underwent treatment with a 30-day regimen of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus enalapril ( 20 mg BID) or losartan ( 50 mg BID) and were assessed with a baseline clinical evaluation , polysomnography , 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring , and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. All the examinations except for polysomnography were repeated at 6 and 18 months of follow-up. We studied 94 hypertensive patients ( mean age , 55 ± 9 years). The frequency of OSA was 55 %. Compared with baseline , we did not observe significant differences between groups in 24-hour BP , daytime systolic and diastolic BPs , or night-time systolic BP at 6 and 18 months. The BP control rate at 24 hours ( < 130/80 mm Hg) was similar between the groups ( baseline , 42.3 % versus 45.2 %; 6 months , 46.9 % versus 57.5 %; 18 months , 66.7 % versus 61.5 %). However , patients with OSA had higher night-time diastolic BP decrease than did the non-OSA group ( 6 months , -4.9 ± 11.8 versus -0.3 ± 10.3 mm Hg; 18 months , -6.7 ± 11.1 versus -1.2 ± 10.6 mm Hg;
