  Context/Objective Following acute spinal cord injury ( ASCI) in rabbits , subarachnoid space injection of Danshen was performed to protect the neurological damage. In this study , we established rabbit models of spinal cord injury using a modified Allen 's method. Design After the operation introducing the injuries , the rabbits were randomized into two different groups , control group ( normal saline , NS) and Danshen , a component extracted from Chinese herb , treatment group. Each rabbit was supplied with either the drug or placebo at 0.3 ml/kg each day through subarachnoid cavity. Setting Rabbit model of acute spinal cord injury were used for the response to Danshen treatment. Participants Total 48 Chinese rabbits aged four âˆ¼ five months old provided by Experimental Animal Center of Hubei Province were used for this study. Interventions Danshen drug or placebo was administered via a silicon tube embedded under the spinal dura mater to administer the drugs into subarachnoid cavity. Outcome Measures After the treatment , damage indicators including cell apoptosis , morphological changes and oxidative damages were assessed. Results We found out that cell apoptosis was decreased after Danshen injection as determined by downregulation of apoptosis index ( AI) by TUNEL analysis as well as propidium iodide ( PI) percentage by FACS analysis. In the meanwhile , we observed cells after the treatment have increased numbers of BCL-2 positive cells , this indicated the antiapoptotic gene expression is increased after Danshen treatment. When we check the oxidative damage indicators , we found superoxide dismutase ( SOD) was increased and malondiadehyde ( MDA) levels were decreased after the treatment. Conclusion Danshen can protect ASCI through inhibition of oxidative damage in the injured cells and thus reduce the subsequent cell apoptosis in the spinal.
