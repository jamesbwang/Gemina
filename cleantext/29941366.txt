  In this study , a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( real time RT-PCR) assay targeting 2 genetic segments was established to detect HDV RNA. Utilizing the World Health Organization International Standard for Hepatitis<disease> D Virus RNA , the lower limit of detection was 575 IU/mL , and the linearity of quantification ranged from 575,000 IU/mL to 575 IU/mL. 384 HBsAg-positive samples collected from China were tested by this method and HDV antibody detection. Eleven samples were positive for anti-HDV IgG which may persist after HDV resolution , 6 samples were HDV RNA positive , and 5 samples were positive for anti-HDV IgM. This assay showed more sensitivity than the detection of anti-HDV IgM. These data demonstrate that the real-time RT-PCR assay for HDV RNA could be implemented in the clinical detection of HDV infection in chronic HBV-infected patients in China.
