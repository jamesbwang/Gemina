  Tumor heterogeneity has hampered the development of novel effective therapeutic options for aggressive cancers , including the deadly primary adult brain tumor glioblastoma ( GBM). Intratumoral heterogeneity is partially attributed to the tumor initiating cell ( TIC) subset that contains highly tumorigenic , stem-like cells. TICs display metabolic plasticity but can have a reliance on aerobic glycolysis. Elevated expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 is present in many cancer types , with GLUT3 being preferentially expressed in brain TICs ( BTICs) to increase survival in low nutrient tumor microenvironments , leading to tumor maintenance. Through structure-based virtual screening ( SBVS) , we identified potential novel GLUT inhibitors. The screening of 13 compounds identified two that preferentially inhibit the growth of GBM cells with minimal toxicity to non-neoplastic astrocytes and neurons. These compounds , SRI-37683 and SRI-37684 , also inhibit glucose uptake and decrease the glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve capacity of GBM patient-derived xenograft ( PDX) cells in glycolytic stress test assays. Our results suggest a potential new therapeutic avenue to target metabolic reprogramming for the treatment of GBM , as well as other tumor types , and the identified novel inhibitors provide an excellent starting point for further lead development.
