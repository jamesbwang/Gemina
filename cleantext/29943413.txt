  The aim of this study was to understand nurses ' opinions about initiating spiritual or religious conversation during patient care and to measure how these perspectives are associated with demographic , religious and work-related characteristics. Nurses are expected to provide spiritual care and do so in diverse ways. Little is known about how nurses think about initiating spiritual or religious discourse. Cross-sectional , quantitative. Online survey methods allowed data collection from 445 nurses. The survey , accessed from the homepage of the Journal of Christian Nursing for 6 months beginning June 2015 , included scales measuring various facets of religiosity , and items assessing nurse opinions about introducing spirituality or religion during patient care and demographic and work-related variables. Variables showing significant associations with Nurse Opinion items in bivariate analyses were examined using binary logistic regression. About 90 % of participants believed it appropriate to initiate conversation about spirituality/religion and nearly three-quarters thought it appropriate to self-disclose spirituality/religion or offer prayer under certain circumstances or anytime. All personal religiosity indicators except tentativeness of belief were found to be associated with responses to Nurse Opinion items. That is , higher religiosity was associated with opinion one could initiate such conversations , whereas lower religiosity was associated with waiting for patients to initiate. Nurses working in a faith-based organization were 276 % more likely to believe they could initiate such conversation and 153 % more likely to think they could initiate an offer of prayer. Nurse religiosity and work environment were associated with nurse opinions about initiating spiritual/religious discourse with patients.
