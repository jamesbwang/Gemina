  The implementation of massively parallel sequencing ( MPS) in forensic science revealed the advantages of the new method compared to the forensic benchmark in DNA-STR analysis , the capillary-electrophoresis ( CE): Sequence information and the possibility to multiplex hundreds of markers in one multiplex PCR increase the discrimination power of a forensic ( STR-) profile. The EU funded project DNASeqEx ( DNA-STR Massive Sequencing & International Information Exchange) aims to evaluate MPS-based materials in their respective developmental stages using the two established platforms MiSeq FGx ( Illumina) and Ion S5 ™ ( Thermo Fisher Scientific). As part of this project , we present here an inter-laboratory validation of the Forenseq ™ DNA Signature Prep Kit , focussing on STRs included in primer mix A. Our study comprises tests of concordance , reproducibility , sensitivity ( 1 ng , 500 pg , 250 pg , 125 pg , 63 pg , 31 pg) and mixtures ( male-male and male-female at ratios of 1:1 , 1:5 , 1:10 , 1:15 , 1:20 , 1:100 , 1:500 , 1:1000). Sequencing results found to be virtually concordant to CE results , to reference profiles and reproducible between duplicates and between both laboratories. We observed first locus drop-outs ( LDO) at a DNA input of 63 pg ( 20 sample pool) and 125 pg ( 38 sample pool). Alleles were found to be well balanced at a DNA input of 250 pg or more. We found the kit to perform well on moderate mixtures ( 1:1-1:20).
