  Nepafenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID) , currently only available as 0.1 % ophthalmic suspension ( Nevanac ®). This study utilized hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin ( HPBCD) to increase the water solubility and trans-corneal permeation of nepafenac. The nepafenac-HPBCD complexation in the liquid and solid states were confirmed by phase solubility , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) , and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( NMR) analyses. Nepafenac 0.1 % ophthalmic solution was formulated using HPBCD ( same pH and osmolality as that of Nevanac ®) and pig eye trans-corneal permeation was studied versus Nevanac ®. Furthermore , nepafenac content in cornea , sclera<symptom> , iris , lens , aqueous humor , choroid , ciliary body , retina , and vitreous humor was studied in a continuous isolated pig eye perfusion model in comparison to the suspension and Nevanac ®. Permeation studies using porcine corneas<symptom> revealed that the solution formulation had a permeation rate 18 times higher than Nevanac ®. Furthermore , the solution had 11 times higher corneal retention than Nevanac ®. Drug distribution studies using porcine eyes revealed that the solution formulation enables detectable levels in various ocular tissues while the drug was undetectable by Nevanac ®. The ocular solution formulation had a significantly higher drug concentration in the cornea compared to the suspension or Nevanac ®.
