  Re ( I)- catalyzed hydropropargylation reaction of silyl enol ethers was realized utilizing dynamic interconversion of vinylidene-alkenylmetal intermediates , where alkenylmetals underwent 1,5-hydride transfer of the Î±-hydrogen to generate vinylidene intermediates. Furthermore , this process was found to be in an equilibrium.
