  Various medications are cleared by the kidneys , therefore patients with impaired renal function , especially dialysis patients are at risk for adverse drug events ( ADEs). There are limited studies on ADEs in maintenance dialysis patients. We utilized a nationally representative database , the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample , from 2008 to 2013 , to compare emergency department ( ED) visits for dialysis and propensity matched non-dialysis patients. Log binomial regression was used to calculate relative risk of hospital admission and logistic regression to calculate ORs for in-hospital mortality while adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. While ED visits for ADEs decreased in both groups , they were over 10-fold higher in dialysis patients than non-dialysis patients ( 65.8-88.5 per 1,000 patients vs. 4.6-5.4 per 1,000 patients respectively , p < 0.001). The top medication category associated with ED visits for ADEs in dialysis patients is agents primarily affecting blood constituents , which has increased. After propensity matching , patient admission was higher in dialysis patients than non-dialysis patients , ( 88 vs. 76 % , p < 0.001). Dialysis was associated with a 3 % increase in risk of admission and 3 times the odds of in-hospital mortality ( adjusted OR 3 , 95 % CI 2.7-2.3.3). ED visits for ADEs are substantially higher in dialysis patients than non-dialysis patients. In dialysis patients , ADEs associated with agents primarily affecting blood constituents are on the rise. ED visits for ADEs in dialysis patients have higher inpatient admissions and in-hospital mortality. Further studies are needed to identify and implement measures aimed at reducing ADEs in dialysis patients.
