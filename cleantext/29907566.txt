  Evidence for the Crabtree effect was first reported by H. Crabtree in 1929 and is defined as the glucose-induced decrease of cellular respiratory flux. This effect was observed in tumor cells and was not detected in most non-tumor cells. A number of hypotheses on the mechanism underlying the Crabtree effect have been formulated. However , to this day , no consensual mechanism for this effect has been described. In a previous study on isolated mitochondria , we have proposed that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate ( F1 ,6 bP) , which inhibits the respiratory chain , induces the Crabtree effect. Using whole cells from the yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> as a model , we show here not only that F1 ,6 bP plays a key role in the process but that glucose-6-phosphate ( G6P) , a hexose that has an effect opposite to that of F1 ,6 bP on the regulation of the respiratory flux , does as well. Thus , these findings reveal that the Crabtree effect strongly depends on the ratio between these two glycolysis-derived hexose phosphates. Last , in silico modeling of the Crabtree effect illustrated the requirement of an inhibition of the respiratory flux by a coordinated variation of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fit the respiratory rate decrease observed upon glucose addition to cells. In summary , we conclude that two glycolysis-derived hexose phosphates , G6P and F1 ,6 bP , play a key role in the induction of the Crabtree effect.
