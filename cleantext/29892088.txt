  Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome<disease> ( WHS) is a genomic disorder with a recognizable dysmorphology profile caused by hemizygosity at 4p16 .3. Previous attempts have failed to map the minimal critical locus to a single gene , leaving open the possibility that the core phenotypic components of the syndrome<disease> are caused by the combined haploinsufficiency of multiple genes. Clinical exome sequencing and `` reverse '' phenotyping. We identified two patients with de novo truncating variants in WHSC1 , which maps to the WHS critical locus. The phenotype of these two individuals is consistent with WHS , which suggests that haploinsufficiency of WHSC1 is sufficient to recapitulate the core phenotype ( characteristic facies , and growth and developmental delay) of this classic microdeletion syndrome<disease>. Our study expands the list of microdeletion syndromes<disease> that are solved at the single-gene level , and establishes WHSC1 as a disease gene in humans. Given the severe nature of the reported variants , the full phenotypic expression of WHSC1 may be further expanded by future reports of milder variants.
