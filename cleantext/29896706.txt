  Apart from morphological , biochemical , and genetic alterations induced by teratogen compounds , there is an increase interest in characterizing behavioral alterations. Behavior is a sensitive parameter that can provide information regarding developmental disruptions noninvasively , as it is the result of brain processes. Behavioral disturbances interfere with animals ' capacity to cope with the environment , having an impact on the organism 's life. Hereby , it is proposed behavioral assays consisting on recording larvae in multiwell plates and video analysis with a proper software , allowing for teratogen screening of behavior. How to evaluate locomotor , anxiety-like and avoidance-like behaviors , and the integrity of sensory-motor functions and learning are discussed in this chapter.
