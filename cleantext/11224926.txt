  BACKGROUND Although a relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and articular cartilage degeneration has been reported , little is known regarding its role in articular cartilage injury induced by sports activities. In this study , we evaluated the role of VEGF in a rat model of chronic sports arthritic injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS Animals were divided into 3 groups: Control ( n = 10) , Vehicle ( chronic sports arthritic injury , n = 10) , and Bevacizumab ( chronic sports arthritic injury treated with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab , n = 10). RESULTS No significant difference in body<symptom> weight was observed following the establishment of chronic sports arthritic injury among these 3 groups. Compared with the Vehicle group , Bevacizumab exhibited improved structure of articular cartilage ( revealed by HE staining) , as well as elevated cartilage content ( revealed by Safranin O staining). Moreover , altered cytokines were observed after Bevacizumab treatment , indicating the significant decrease in levels of interleukin ( IL) -1 β , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -1 , and MMP-3 , and a clear increase in levels of transforming growth factor ( TGF)- β1. CONCLUSIONS All these findings demonstrate that Bevacizumab treatment ameliorated cartilage degradation in rats subjected to chronic sports arthritic injury. Our results provide evidence supporting use of targeted therapy for VEGF in the clinical treatment of chronic sports arthritic injury.
