  Chlortetracycline is ( CTC) is a tetracycline antibiotic which is being in the white-tailed deer industry to improve production and animal health. In this paper , we present a method for determining chlortetracycline residues in edible white-tailed deer tissues , using liquid chromatography with heated electrospray ionization and mass spectrometry detection. The procedure involved extraction with EDTA-McIlvaine buffer at pH 4.0 , followed by solid-phase extraction cleanup using a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance<symptom> ( HLB) cartridge. The liquid chromatography analysis was performed with heated electrospray ionization and mass spectrometry detection. The limit of quantification for the method was 2.7 ng/g and limit of detection was 0.8 ng/g. The recovery values were > 78.5 % for muscle , 65.1 % for kidney , 63.1 % for liver. Mean tissue residue concentration of chlortetracycline and it 's epimer , 4-epi chlortetracycline ( 4-epi-CTC) at 10-day withdrawal period for kidney , liver , muscle was 122.8 , 44.7 and 26.7 ng/g , respectively. Chlortetracycline tissue residue concentration at 45-day withdrawal period for kidney , liver , muscle was 19.2 , 28.9 and 10.7 ng/g , respectively. Mean tissue concentration of CTC was less than the established maximum residual limit ( MRL) values for bovine tissues. We have validated and successfully applied this method in the qualitative and quantification of chlortetracycline in white-tailed deer tissue samples.
