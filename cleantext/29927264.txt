  Based on data from 710 2-parent families enrolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development , this article examined dyadic and family-level interdependence among indicators of family members ' competence over time. A cross-lagged model that included children and both parents was used to simultaneously test relations among observed maternal sensitivity , observed paternal sensitivity , and children 's externalizing behavior from 54 months to fifth grade. Testing 3 principal hypotheses , the study supported basic assumptions of a transactional family systems approach: ( a) mother-child and father-child relations were independent predictors of change in children 's and parents ' behavior across middle childhood; ( b) at all assessments , each parents ' sensitive parenting predicted subsequent change in the other 's sensitive parenting; and ( c) both dyadic indirect effects between two family members and family-level indirect effects among all 3 family members were found. When predicting each members ' behavior over time , a model that included both dyadic and family-level relations was superior to models that included only dyadic relations. Tests of 2 exploratory hypotheses suggested that ( a) fathers ' parenting predicted changes in mothers ' parenting as equally as mothers ' parenting predicted changes in fathers ' parenting; and ( b) mothers ' parenting tended to be more influential early in development , and fathers ' parenting was more influential later in development. The results suggest that individual development within families reflects complex dyadic and family-level interdependence among the behaviors of mothers , fathers , and their children over time.
