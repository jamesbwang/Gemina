  Refractive surgery is a field in constant evolution. In recent years , a new procedure has appeared under the name SMILE ( SMall Incision Lenticule Extraction). This technique , carried out solely with a femtosecond laser , should make it possible to better preserve corneal innervation and biomechanics. After a detailed review of the technique itself , we then focus on the scientific evidence for the safety and efficacy of SMILE and its current indications. Advantages of SMILE will be discussed in comparison to the conventional techniques , particularly concerning dry eye and the risk of corneal ectasia related to LASIK. Lastly , the current limitations of SMILE ( indications , retreatment) are discussed , and future applications are considered regarding new improvements in the technique.
