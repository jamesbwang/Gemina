  The presence of tumour deposits ( TDs) in colorectal cancer ( CRC) is associated with poor prognosis. The seventh edition of TNM subclassified a new nodal stage , N1c , characterized by the presence of TDs without any concurrent positive lymph node ( LN). It is not clear if the N1c category is or is not equal to LN metastasis. We aimed to examine the prevalence , characteristics and prognostic significance of this new subcategory. Consecutive patients who underwent surgery for CRC in two centres ( 2011-2014) were analysed. N1 cM0 patients were matched against non-N1 cM0 ( N0 , N1a and N1b) patients for 3-year overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS). We identified 1122 patients with 648 ( 57.8 %) colonic cancers. In 57 patients ( 5.1 %) , N1c status was associated with rectal cancers ( rectum = 33/57 ( 57.9 %) vs colon = 24/57 ( 42.1 %); P = 0.029) , a higher pathological tumour stage ( pT3-T4 N1c = 55/843 ( 6.5 % vspT3-T4 non-N1c = 2/279 ( 0.7 %); P < 0.0001) and vascular emboli ( n = 35 ( 61.4 %) vs n = 552 ( 51.8 %); P = 0.0305). Synchronous metastasis was observed in 23 cases ( 40 %). After a mean follow-up of 31 months , 3-year OS for M0 patients , was 89.4 % , 89.1 % , 86.6 % and 81.8 % for N0 , N1a , N1b and N1c tumours , respectively. DFS was significantly worse for N1c than for N0 ( P = 0.0169) , with N1c status having a significant effect on DFS in colonic cancers ( P = 0.014). The presence of more than one TD was associated with a significantly worse DFS ( P = 0.021). Our results indicate that N1c CRC patients should be included among high-risk patients for whom it is widely accepted that adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered.
