  Studying the movements of oceanic migrants has been elusive until the advent of several tracking devices , such as the light-level geolocators. Stable isotope analysis ( SIA) offers a complementary approach to infer areas used year-round , but its suitability in oceanic environments remains almost unexplored. To evaluate SIA as a tool for inferring movements of oceanic migrants , we sampled an oceanic seabird , the Bulwer 's petrel , Bulweria bulwerii , in four breeding colonies spread along its Atlantic distribution. We first studied the species moulting pattern from 29 corpses collected in the colonies. Secondly , based on this moult knowledge , we selected three feathers from tracked birds to infer their breeding and non-breeding grounds using SIA: the 1st primary ( P1) , the 8th secondary ( S8) and the 6th rectrix ( R6) feathers. Birds migrated to two main non-breeding areas , the Central or the South Atlantic Ocean. P1 showed similar isotopic values among petrels from different breeding colonies , suggesting this feather is replaced early in the non-breeding period in a common area used by most birds , the Central Atlantic. S8 and R6 feathers correctly assigned 92 % and 81 % , respectively , of the birds to their non-breeding areas , suggesting they were replaced late in season , when birds were settled in their main non-breeding grounds. Our results showed that the isotopic baseline levels of the Central and South Atlantic are propagated through the food web until reaching top predators , suggesting these ratios can be used to infer the movement of long-distance migrants among oceanic water masses.
