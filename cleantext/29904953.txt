  Wearable devices and systems demand multifunctional units with intelligent and integrative functions. Smart fibers with response to external stimuli , such as electrical , thermal , and photonic signals , etc. , as well as offering energy storage/conversion are essential units for wearable electronics , but still remain great challenges. Herein , flexible , strong , and self-cleaning graphene-aerogel composite fibers , with tunable functions of thermal conversion and storage under multistimuli , are fabricated. The fibers made from porous graphene aerogel/organic phase-change materials coated with hydrophobic fluorocarbon resin render a wide range of phase transition temperature and enthalpy ( 0-186 J g
