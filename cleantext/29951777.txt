  The purpose of this study was to identify the differences in femoral dimensions among Caucasian and Oriental populations. A total of 268 femora were collected from China , Japan , Korea , Taiwan and the United States. Firstly , the dimensional parameters for measuring femur were identified. These were initially measured on bone specimens to determine the methodology , followed by measuring the same parameter on plane radiographs of the same bone specimen using a board , and digitized with the aim of verifying the repeatability and reliability of the data. Data were analyzed using ANOVA , paired students t test and Pearson 's correlation analysis. The results revealed that Caucasian femora are significantly larger in maximum bone length ( BL) , head-neck length ( HNL) , lesser trochanter width and the total width of the distal epiphysis ( Wdf). The Beijing femora were found to be the longest and the Japanese femora constituted the shortest bone lengths and smallest angle alpha among the Oriental populations. A strong correlation was observed between Wdf and HD , HNL , Wmc and Wlc in all the populations; however , correlation between Wdf and BL was mild. The angle alpha showed no correlation with BL. This study generated a large database of femoral geometry , which may help pharmaceutical companies to design orthopedic implants for Oriental populations.
