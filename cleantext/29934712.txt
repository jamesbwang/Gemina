  The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether exposure to particles induces an imbalance in 70-kDa heat shock<symptom> proteins ( HSP70). Since intracellularly ( iHSP70) it has anti-inflammatory roles whereas extracellularly ( eHSP70) it has pro-inflammatory roles , we evaluate the effect of residual oil fly ash ( ROFA) exposure on eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio ( H index) , a biomarker of inflammatory status that is related to oxidative stress in plasma and lymphoid tissue. Wistar rats that received ROFA suspension for three consecutive days ( 750 Î¼g) showed an increase in plasma eHSP70 levels ( mainly the 72-kDa inducible form). Also , ROFA promoted alterations on plasma oxidative stress ( increased protein carbonyl groups and superoxide dismutase activity , and decrease sulfhydryl groups). There was an increase in H index of the plasma/thymus with no changes in circulating leukocyte level , iHSP70 , or oxidative stress markers in lymphoid tissues. Our results support the hypothesis that eHSP70 content and H index represent inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers.
