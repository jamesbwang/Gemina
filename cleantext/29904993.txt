  Toxin A and Toxin B ( TcdA/TcdB) are large glucosyltransferases produced by Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen>. TcdB but not TcdA induces reactive oxygen species-mediated early cell death ( ECD) when applied at high concentrations. We found that nonglucosylated Rac1 is essential for induction of ECD since inhibition of Rac1 impedes this effect. ECD only occurs when TcdB is rapidly endocytosed. This was shown by generation of chimeras using the trunk of TcdB from a hypervirulent strain. TcdB from hypervirulent strain has been described to translocate from endosomes at higher pH values and thus , meaning faster than reference type TcdB. Accordingly , intracellular delivery of the glucosyltransferase domain of reference TcdB by the trunk of TcdB from hypervirulent strain increased ECD. Furthermore , proton transporters such as sodium/proton exchanger ( NHE) or the ClC-5 anion/proton exchanger , both of which contribute to endosomal acidification , also affected cytotoxic potency of TcdB: Specific inhibition of NHE reduced cytotoxicity , whereas transfection of cells with the endosomal anion/proton exchanger ClC-5 increased cytotoxicity of TcdB. Our data suggest that both the uptake rate of TcdB into the cytosol and the status of nonglucosylated Rac1 are key determinants that are decisive for whether ECD or delayed apoptosis is triggered.
