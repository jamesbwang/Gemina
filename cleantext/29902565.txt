  Reproducibility of quantitative perfusion analysis of DCE requires a standardized AIF acquisition. However , there are many different approaches for AIF assessment so that the absolute values of perfusion parameters may vary depending on the used method. This study analyzes the influence of the method of AIF determination on quantitative DCE-MRI. In this retrospective , single-center , cohort study three different methods of AIF determination in 50 consecutive patients with multiparametric MRI of the prostate were conducted. As a reference , AIF was selected manually by defining a region of interest in an artery manually ( AIF In all three methods , K AIF
