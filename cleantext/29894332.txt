  Defining high-grade glioma resectability is a challenge; and currently , it is based on anatomical imaging. However , complete removal of contrast-enhancing tumor is difficult to define in MRI. We present three cases of patients diagnosed with high-grade glioma. Brain MRI and F-fluorocholine PET/CT were performed before and after surgery to establish the extent of resection ( EOR) and residual volume. Postoperative brain MRI and PET parameters showed discordant results in all the reported cases. PET was able to assess properly the EOR; however , the rules for the EOR establishment and its prognostic implication should be validated in prospective studies.
