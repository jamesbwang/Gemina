  Iron deficiency anemia<symptom> represents 3rd largest disease burden , with an estimated 6.9 billion disability-adjusted life years. Iron-fortified cereals ( IFIC) can contribute substantially in preventing iron deficiency anemia<symptom> and maintaining an adequate body iron status. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of IFIC intake along with other complementary food/s on the hemoglobin ( hb) level of children from 12 to 24 months of age. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2015 to February 2016 in three pediatric outpatient clinics of New Delhi , India. A predesigned questionnaire was used to elicit information on socio-demography , complementary feeding , and intake of IFIC from 66 mother and child pairs. Child 's anthropometric measurement and hb levels were recorded by the pediatrician. Chi-square and Student 's Out of 66 children , 60.6 % ( Intake of IFIC ( minimum 1-2 serving/day) was associated with the lesser chance of anemia<symptom> in children of 12-24 months. However , gender and low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight were also associated with anemia<symptom> IFIC may have a role in mass fortification programs. However , further larger and controlled studies are recommended to test this hypothesis.
