  This Personal Account describes the author 's involvement in the field of microwave-assisted organic synthesis ( MAOS) from the late 1990 's starting out with kitchen microwave ovens right through to the development of a reactor in 2016 that- although not using microwave technology- in many ways mimics the performance of a modern laboratory microwave. The reader is taken along a journey that has spanned two decades of intense research on various aspects of microwave chemistry , and , at the same time , was intimately linked to key innovations regarding equipment design and development. A `` behind the scenes '' approach is taken in this article to share- from a very personal point of view- how specific projects and research ideas were conceived and developed in my research group , and how in general the field of microwave chemistry has progressed in the last two decades.
