  Transition metal oxides exhibit a high potential for application in the field of electronic devices , energy storage , and energy conversion. The ability of building these types of materials by atomic layer-by-layer techniques provides a possibility to design novel systems with favored functionalities. In this study , by means of the atomic layer-by-layer oxide molecular beam epitaxy technique , we designed oxide heterostructures consisting of tetragonal K
