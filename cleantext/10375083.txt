  Primary testicular lymphoma ( PTL) is a form of extra-nodal lymphoma originating from the testicles. Currently , positron emission tomography ( PET) with glucose analogue This study included 12 patients with PTL between 2004 and 2015. We retrospectively examined PET/CT results along with patient outcome. The maximum standardized uptake value ( SUV The mean overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS) was 44.5 months and 35.5 months , respectively. The mean SUV FDG PET/CT is very helpful in both staging and evaluating treatment response. Although it is not a perfect tool in the initial diagnosis , it might aid in the differential diagnosis of challenging testicular tumors. Pre-treatment and post-treatment FDG uptake values may also have a prognostic value in patients with PTL.
