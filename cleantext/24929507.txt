  In order to provide a reference for reconstructing the paleoclimate of the northeastern Indian Ocean , 36 airborne pollen samples were analyzed using methods for airborne pollen , and 26 surface water samples were analyzed using a lab method for surface water. We found that little pollen is airborne over the Indian Ocean in spring , but airborne pollen types and concentrations can help to deduce paleomonsoon strength and direction. The conclusions included the following: ( 1) Pollen in the sediment was transported mainly via ocean currents instead of the early summer or spring wind. ( 2) Airborne pollen types and concentrations are proportional to the wind speed and inversely proportional to the pollen distance transported and depend on whether the wind is from the land or from the sea. If the wind is from the land , the pollen concentration is proportional to the angle between the wind direction and the coastline. ( 3) The pollen concentration in the sample collected from a water depth of 30-45 m is higher than in the samples collected from a depth of 5 m. The pollen concentration and salinity are higher in the equatorial area than in the Northern Hemisphere.
