  We investigated the therapeutic effects of l-homocarnosine against inflammation<symptom> in a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Rats were grouped into control , middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO) , 0.5 mM l-homocarnosine + MCAO , and 1 mM l-homocarnosine + MCAO treatment groups. Superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , glutathione peroxidase ( Gpx) , catalase , lipid peroxidation , and reduced glutathione ( GSH) levels were measured. Neurological scores were assessed , and histopathology , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , and fluorescence microscopy analyses were conducted. The mRNA expression levels of nod-like receptor protein 3 ( NLRP3) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF-α) , and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) and protein expression levels of NLRP3 were assessed. l-Homocarnosine supplementation substantially increased SOD , catalase , Gpx , and GSH levels , whereas it reduced the levels of lipid peroxidation relative to MCAO rats. l-Homocarnosine significantly reduced the infarct area and neurological deficit score , as well as histopathological alteration , apoptosis , and necrosis<symptom> in brain tissue. The mRNA expression levels of NLRP3 , TNF-α , and IL-6 were increased in MCAO rats , whereas l-homocarnosine supplementation reduced mRNA expression by > 40 % , and NLRP3 protein expression was reduced by > 30 % in 1 mM l-homocarnosine-treated MCAO rats. We propose that l-homocarnosine exerts a protective effect in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury-induced rats by downregulating NLRP3 expression.
