  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) results in high morbidity and mortality among patients nationally and globally. The Korean clinical practice guideline for COPD was revised in 2018. The guideline was drafted by the members of the Korean Academy of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases as well as the participating members of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service , Korean Physicians ' Association , and Korea Respiration Trouble Association. The revised guideline encompasses a wide range of topics , including the epidemiology , diagnosis , assessment , monitoring , management , exacerbation , and comorbidities of COPD in Korea. We performed systematic reviews assisted by an expert in meta-analysis to draft a guideline on COPD management. We expect this guideline to facilitate the treatment of patients with respiratory conditions by physicians as well other health care professionals and government personnel in South Korea.
