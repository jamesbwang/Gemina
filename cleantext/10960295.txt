  Myoclonus is an abnormal<symptom> involuntary<symptom> movement<symptom> that has been previously reported with administration of high doses of opioids for prolonged periods of time. In this case , however , we report an acute myoclonic reaction and review the literature on the possible causative pathophysiology. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman who was admitted for postdated cesarean section. She started to have abnormal<symptom> involuntary<symptom> movements<symptom> after administration of an epidural anesthesia containing 700 Î¼g of fentanyl with 115 mL ( 0.5) bupivacaine and 40 mL ( 2 %) lidocaine. Upon examination , the patient was conscious , alert , and oriented. Her vital signs were stable. Her movements can be described as generalized , sudden , involuntary , jerking movements , involving the upper limbs , head , torso as well as the lower limbs. The frequency of these jerks was about every 1-2 min lasting for 10 s. There was no change in level of consciousness<symptom> during these abnormal<symptom> movements<symptom>. The rest of the neurological examination was normal. Laboratory values showed normoglycemia and normal serum biochemistry. A routine electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform activity. Brain imaging was normal. Based on history , examination , and laboratory findings , we made the diagnosis of drug-induced myoclonus , which in this clinical scenario was secondary to fentanyl. We discontinued fentanyl and , gradually , the intensity and frequency of the abnormal<symptom> movements<symptom> decreased and disappeared after a few hours. A clear definitive explanation of the acute effect of opioids is still to be reached. It involves an interaction of complex neuroanatomical pathways and neurophysiological receptors. Nonetheless , a unanimous effort is needed to raise awareness about the role of opioids in the development of abnormal<symptom> movements<symptom> and their clinical management , to insure that they do not go unnoticed in the clinical scenarios , and to further add more scientific content that could help in reaching an explanatory theory.
