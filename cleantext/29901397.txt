  Illumination of the aromatic heptaene macrolide antifungal antibiotic candicicin D with UV light results in an isomerization of the molecule. The product formed after irradiation of the candicidin complex with UV light ( Î» = 365 nm) , namely , iso-candicidin D , was isolated and subjected to 2D NMR studies , consisting of DQF-COSY , ROESY , TOCSY , HSQC , and HMBC experiments. The obtained spectral data unambiguously evidenced that iso-candicidin D was the all-trans isomer of the native antibiotic , and straightening of the heptaenic chromophore was the only light-induced structural change that occurred. Hence , iso-candicidin D was proclaimed to be a prototype of a novel class of polyene macrolide antifungal antibiotics: the all-trans aromatic heptaenes , containing a macrolide ring similar to that of amphotericin B.
