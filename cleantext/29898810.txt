  Skeletal muscle contracts or relaxes to maintain the body position and locomotion. For the contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle , Ca2 + in the cytosol of skeletal muscle fibers acts as a switch to turn on and off a series of contractile proteins. The cytosolic Ca2 + level in skeletal muscle fibers is governed mainly by movement of Ca2 + between the cytosol and the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR). Store-operated Ca2 + entry ( SOCE) , a Ca2 + entryway from the extracellular space to the cytosol , has gained a significant amount of attention from muscle physiologists. Orai1 and stromal interaction molecule 1 ( STIM1) are the main protein identities of SOCE. This mini-review focuses on the roles of STIM proteins and SOCE in the physiological and pathophysiological functions of skeletal muscle and in their correlations with recently identified proteins , as well as historical proteins that are known to mediate skeletal muscle function.
