  Intimate partner homicide ( IPH) is a serious problem throughout the world. Research has identified the continued need to examine risk factors for IPH to identify individuals who may be at a greater risk of IPH perpetration or victimization. In this study , we conducted a meta-analysis on risk factors for male IPH perpetration and female IPH victimization. This meta-analysis examined results from 17 studies , which included 148 effect sizes used in the analysis. Primary findings from this research suggest the strongest risk factors for IPH were the perpetrator having direct access to a gun , perpetrator 's previous nonfatal strangulation , perpetrator 's previous rape of the victim , perpetrator 's previous threat with a weapon , the perpetrator 's demonstration of controlling behaviors , and the perpetrator 's previous threats to harm the victim. Implications for law enforcement personnel , medical professionals , victim advocates , mental health professionals , and other professionals who may be in contact with potential IPH perpetrators and victims are discussed.
