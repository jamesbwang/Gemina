  Cognitive-behavioural therapy is a first-line treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) , but it is difficult to implement in disaster settings. We report the case of an 80-year-old Japanese woman , who was diagnosed with PTSD after the 2011 triple disaster ( earthquake , tsunami and nuclear plant accident) in Fukushima. Her recovery was greatly enhanced by the social support she received while living in Idobata-Nagaya community housing , established by Soma city in Fukushima , where residents could naturally discuss their traumatic experiences. Habituation to traumatic memories and processing of cognitive aspects of the psychological trauma , which are therapeutic mechanisms of trauma-focused psychotherapies , spontaneously occurred in this setting. The details of this case support the effectiveness of Idobata Nagaya as a provider of psychological first aid , an evidence-informed approach to assist children , adolescents , adults and families in the aftermath of a disaster.
