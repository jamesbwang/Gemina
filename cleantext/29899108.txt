  Host receptor usage by KSHV has been best studied using primary microvascular endothelial and fibroblast cells , although the virus infects a wide variety of cell types in culture and in natural infections. In these two infection models , KSHV adheres to the cell though heparan sulfate ( HS) binding , then interacts with a complex of EphA2 , xct , and integrins α3β1 , αVβ3 , αVβ5 to catalyze viral entry. We dissected this receptor complex at the genetic level with CRISPR-Cas9 to precisely determine receptor usage in two epithelial cell lines. Surprisingly , we discovered an infection mechanism that requires HS and EphA2 but is independent of αV- and β1-family integrin expression. Furthermore , infection appears to be independent of the EphA2 intracellular domain. We also demonstrated that while two other endogenous Eph receptors were dispensable for KSHV infection , transduced EphA4 and EphA5 significantly enhanced infection of cells lacking EphA2.
