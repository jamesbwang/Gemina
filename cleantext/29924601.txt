  Poplar hybrids can be used for selenium ( Se) and boron ( B) phytoremediation under saline conditions. The phenolic antioxidant stress response of two salt and B tolerant poplar hybrids of parentage Populus trichocarpa × nigra × deltoides was studied using high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) and absorption-based assays to determine the antioxidant capacity , total phenolic content , hydroxycinnamic acid levels , and the enzyme activity of l-phenylalanine ammonia<pathogen> lyase ( PAL) , polyphenol oxidase ( PPO) , phenol peroxidase ( POD) , and laccase. Most remarkable was the contrasting response of the two poplar clones for PPO activity and phenolic levels to irrigation with high salt/B water. To cope with stressful growing conditions , only one clone increased its phenolic antioxidant level , and each clone displayed different PPO isoform patterns. Our study shows that poplar hybrids of the same parentage can differ in their salt/B stress coping mechanism.
