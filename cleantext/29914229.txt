  Vitamin D modulates innate and adaptive immune responses , and vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients with pneumonia<disease> We evaluated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Korean patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) and its effect on the clinical outcomes of ARDS. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 108 patients who had a measured serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 ( 25 ( OH) D3) at the time of diagnosis with ARDS. The clinical outcomes were evaluated based on 25 ( OH) D3 levels of 20 ng/mL and stratified by quartiles of 25 ( OH) D3 levels. The mean age of patients was 59.4 years old; 77 ( 71.3 %) were male. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 103 patients ( 95.4 %). The mean 25 ( OH) D3 level was 8.3 ± 7.0 ng/mL. Neither in-hospital mortality ( 40.0 % vs. 68.0 %) nor 6-month mortality ( 40.0 % vs. 71.8 %) significantly differed between groups. There were no significant differences in 25 ( OH) D3 level between survivors ( 8.1 ± 7.6 ng/mL) and non-survivors ( 8.5 ± 6.8 ng/mL , p = 0.765). There were no trends toward a difference in mortality among quartiles of 25 ( OH) D3 levels. However , 25 ( OH) D3 levels were inversely related with length of hospital stay and intensive care unit stay among in-hospital survivors. Vitamin D deficiency was prevalent in Korean patients with ARDS. However , levels of vitamin D were not associated with mortality. A large , prospective study is needed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D deficiency on clinical outcomes of ARDS.
