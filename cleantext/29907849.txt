  Hypercapnia causes cerebral vasodilation and increased cerebral blood flow ( CBF). During prolonged hypercapnia it is unknown whether cerebral vasodilation persists and whether cerebrovascular function is preserved. We investigated the effects of prolonged severe hypercapnia on pial arteriolar diameters ( PAD) and cerebrovascular reactivity to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. Piglets were anesthetized , intubated and ventilated. Closed cranial windows were implanted to measure PAD. Changes in PAD were documented during hypercapnia ( PaCO Cerebral vasodilation to hypercapnia was sustained over 120 min. Cerebrovascular responses to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors were preserved during hypercapnia. During hypercapnia , vasodilatory responses to second vasodilators were similar to normocapnia , while exposure to vasoconstrictors caused significant vasoconstriction. Prolonged severe hypercapnia causes sustained vasodilation of pial arteriolar diameters indicative of hyperperfusion. During hypercapnia , cerebral vascular responses to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors were preserved , suggesting that cerebral vascular function remained intact. Of note , cerebral vessels during hypercapnia were capable of further dilation when exposed to additional cerebral vasodilators and , significant vasoconstriction when exposed to vasoconstrictors. Extrapolating these findings to infants , we suggest that severe hypercapnia should be avoided , because it could cause/increase cerebrovascular injury.
