  Novel two dimensional Hadamard encoding/decoding based pure shift NMR acquisition techniques ( TOCSY and HSQC) have been developed , which provide chemical shift information at ultra high resolution in very short spectrometer times. The efficacy of these methods for rapid assignment of chemical shifts in complex NMR spectra of organic molecules/natural products has been demonstrated. This would be of great help for rapid analysis of samples during separation of complex mixtures.
