  Cells use different means to communicate within and between tissues and thereby coordinate their behaviours. Following the initial observations of enigmatic long filopodia unrelated to cell movement , it became clear that the roles of cellular protrusions are not restricted to sensing functions or motility and are much more diverse than previously appreciated. Advances in live-imaging and genetic tools revealed several types of non-conventional cell protrusions and their functions , ranging from tissue patterning , proliferation and differentiation control , tissue matching and cell spacing to more unexpected roles such as priming of cell adhesion as well as bidirectional coordination of tissue movements. Here , we will highlight exciting new insights into highly diverse cell behaviours elicited by protrusions and contact-dependent cell communication , essential for embryonic development across species.
