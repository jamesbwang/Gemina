  The incidence of antithrombotic-associated gastrointestinal ( GI) bleeding is increasing due to the growing advanced age population. There is consensus on ceasing anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents during an acute GI bleeding<symptom> episode but clearer guidance is needed on resumption of these agents. This article reviews evidence for optimal management of antithrombotics in the setting of acute GI bleeding<symptom> and highlights areas in which future studies are needed.
