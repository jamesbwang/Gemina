  The serological diagnosis of human<disease> infection<disease> with Angiostrongylus cantonensis remains problematic because there are no commercially available validated tests. Most laboratories use domestically prepared tests such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) or immunoblotting. Since laboratory facilities are not always available in endemic areas , we developed and assessed a rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assay ( AcQuick The test device was assembled with purified 31-kDa glycoprotein as diagnostic antigen and with gold-labelled anti-human immunoglublin-G as the detector reagent. A total of 97 serum samples were tested- 19 samples from clinically diagnosed patients with detectable A. cantonensis-specific antibody in immunoblotting; 43 samples from patients with other parasitic<disease> diseases<disease> , i.e. gnathostomiasis ( n = 13) , toxocariasis ( n = 2) , trichinellosis ( n = 2) , hookworm infection ( n = 4) , filariasis<disease> ( n = 5) , cysticercosis ( n = 9) , paragonimiasis ( n = 2) , opisthorchiasis ( n = 3) , and malaria<disease> ( n = 3); and 35 samples from normal healthy subjects.
