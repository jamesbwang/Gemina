  Hemiarthroplasty ( HA) of the shoulder has several potential advantages over total shoulder arthroplasty ( TSA) , particularly in the elderly population. This study reviewed long-term results of HA and TSA in patients older than 70 years with glenohumeral osteoarthritis. During a 30-year period , 403 shoulders had undergone HA ( n = 74) or TSA ( n = 329) for glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Outcome measures included pain , range of motion , and postoperative modified Neer ratings. All patients were included in the mortality and revision analyses. A total of 289 shoulders ( 44 HAs and 245 TSAs; mean patient age , 75 years) with a minimum of 5 years of follow-up or follow-up until revision were included. Both groups showed significant improvements in pain , abduction , and external rotation. No significant differences were detected between groups in postoperative pain , range of motion , or modified Neer ratings. Operative time was significantly lower in the HA group. There was no statistically significant difference detected in implant revision-free survival between TSA and HA ( hazard ratio , 3.09) or in overall survival hazard ratio. At long-term follow-up , both HAs and TSAs provided good function in the elderly population. Patients who underwent TSA and patients who underwent HA had similar results , but the latter had a shorter operative time and lower revision rate. Hemiarthroplasty is a reasonable option for patients older than 70 years with end-stage glenohumeral osteoarthritis. ( Orthopedics. 2018; 41 ( 4): 222-228.).
