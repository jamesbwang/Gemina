  In many populations , the patterns of potentially infectious contacts are transients that can be described as a network with dynamic links. The relative timescales of link and contagion dynamics and the characteristics that drive their tempos can lead to important differences to the static case. Here , we propose some essential nomenclature for their analysis , and then review the relevant literature. We describe recent advances in they apply to infection processes , considering all of the methods used to record , measure and analyse them , and their implications for disease transmission. Finally , we outline some key challenges and opportunities in the field.
