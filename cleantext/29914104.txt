  Mobile edge computing is proposed as a promising computing paradigm to relieve the excessive burden of data centers and mobile networks , which is induced by the rapid growth of Internet of Things ( IoT). This work introduces the cloud-assisted multi-cloudlet framework to provision scalable services in cloudlet-based mobile edge computing. Due to the constrained computation resources of cloudlets and limited communication resources of wireless access points ( APs) , IoT sensors with identical computation offloading decisions interact with each other. To optimize the processing delay and energy consumption of computation tasks , theoretic analysis of the computation offloading decision problem of IoT sensors is presented in this paper. In more detail , the computation offloading decision problem of IoT sensors is formulated as a computation offloading game and the condition of Nash equilibrium is derived by introducing the tool of a potential game. By exploiting the finite improvement property of the game , the Computation Offloading Decision ( COD) algorithm is designed to provide decentralized computation offloading strategies for IoT sensors. Simulation results demonstrate that the COD algorithm can significantly reduce the system cost compared with the random-selection algorithm and the cloud-first algorithm. Furthermore , the COD algorithm can scale well with increasing IoT sensors.
