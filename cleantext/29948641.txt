  The aim of this study was to evaluate positron emission tomography ( PET) imaging with ( Mice bearing U87MG human GB cells line were parted into five groups of five mice each. One group was imaged at baseline before the treatment phase; another group was treated with bevacizumab ( BVZ) , another group with temozolomide ( TMZ) , another group with both agents , and the last one was the control group. Tumors growth and biological properties were evaluated by caliper measurements and PET imaging at three time points ( baseline , during treatment t1 = 4-6 days and t2 = 10-12 days). At the end of the study , tumors were counted and analyzed by immunohistochemistry ( CD31 to evaluate microvessel density). The tumor volume assessed by caliper measurements was significantly greater at t1 in the control group than in the TMZ + BVZ-treated group or in the BVZ-treated group. At t2 , tumor volume of all treated groups was significantly smaller than that of the control group. ( (
