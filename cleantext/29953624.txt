  Atrial arrhythmias , particularly atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia<symptom> , can coexist with drug-induced type 1 Brugada electrocardiogram ( ECG) pattern ( DI-Type1-BrP). The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of DI-Type1-BrP in patients with atrioventricular accessory pathways ( AV-APs) and to investigate the clinical , electrocardiographic , electrophysiologic , and genetic characteristics of these patients. One-hundred twenty-four consecutive cases of AV-APs and 84 controls underwent an ajmaline challenge test to unmask DI-Type1-BrP. Genetic screening and analysis was performed in 55 of the cases ( 19 with and 36 without DI-Type1-BrP). Patients with AV-APs were significantly more likely than controls to have a Type1-BrP unmasked ( 16.1 vs 4.8 % , P = 0.012). At baseline , patients with DI-Type1-BrP had higher prevalence of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , QR/rSr ' pattern in V DI-Type1-BrP is relatively common in patients with AV-APs. We identify 12-lead ECG characteristics during preexcitation and orthodromic AVRT that point to an underlying type1-BrP , portending an increased probability for development of malignant arrhythmias.
