  Alvarez lenses are actuated lens-pairs which allow one to tune the optical power by mechanical displacement of subelements. Here , we show that a recently realized modified Alvarez lens design which does not require mechanical actuation can be integrated into a confocal microscope. Instead of mechanically moving them , the sublenses are imaged onto each other in a 4f-configuration , where the lateral image shift leading to a change in optical power is created by a galvo-mirror. The avoidance of mechanical lens shifts leads to a large speed gain for axial ( and hence also 3D) image scans compared to classical Alvarez lenses. We demonstrate that the suggested operation principle is compatible with confocal microscopy. In order to optimize the system , we have drawn advantage of the flexibility a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator offers for the implementation. For given specifications , dedicated diffractive optical elements or freeform elements can be used in combination with resonant galvo-scanners or acousto-optic beam deflectors , to achieve even faster z-scans than reported here , reaching video rate.
