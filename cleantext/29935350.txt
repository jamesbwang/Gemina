  Three polar cyclic hexapeptides differently charged at physiological pH ( 1 = neutral , 2 = anionic , 3 = cationic) were synthesized and their cell permeability measured. Lipophilicity in octanol/water did n't account for the higher permeability of the cationic derivative but three chromatographic indexes ( log K
