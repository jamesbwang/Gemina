  Single-blind , sham-controlled , crossover randomized feasibility study OBJECTIVES: ( 1) Assess the feasibility of a full-scale trial of intermittent theta-burst stimulation ( iTBS) for upper-limb sensorimotor dysfunction following spinal cord injury ( SCI). ( 2) Determine the safety and tolerability of iTBS over primary motor cortex on upper-limb function in people with spinal cord injury ( SCI). Large Tertiary Spinal Injuries Centre METHODS: Participants with incomplete SCI , suffering with upper-limb spasticity were recruited and randomized to receive active/sham iTBS over the hand representation of the primary motor cortex. The intervention was delivered in 10 sessions over a 2-week period , followed by a 2-week washout , before being crossed over to receive the alternative intervention for the same number of sessions. Feasibility was assessed by pre-specified criteria which included recruitment rate of 3 participants per month , 10 completed interventions and 10 complete data sets for 15 recruited participants with no serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included preliminary data collection for spasticity , pain and sensorimotor function. Twelve participants were recruited over 10 weeks ( i.e. , 4.8 per month) , with 11 randomized and 10 completing the intervention protocol with no serious adverse events. Eight complete data sets were obtained as two participants failed to attend follow-up. Data from 10 participants were analyzed , with one early dropout due to an unrelated adverse event. It is safe and feasible to conduct a full-scale trial. Whilst iTBS has shown promising results , further research optimizing the intervention is required to improve anticipated clinical efficacy.
