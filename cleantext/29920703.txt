  In order to avoid patient abuse , under normal situations before performing a medical intervention on a patient , a physician must obtain informed consent from that patient , where to give genuine informed consent a patient must be competent , understand her condition , her options and their expected risks and benefits , and must expressly consent to one of those options. However , many patients refrain from the option that their physician believes to be best , and many physicians worry that their patients make irrational healthcare decisions , hindering their ability to provide efficient healthcare for their patients. Some philosophers have proposed a solution to this problem: they advocate that physicians nudge their patients to steer them towards their physician 's preferred option. A nudge is any influence designed to predictably alter a person 's behavior without limiting their options or giving them reasons to act. Proponents of nudging contend that nudges are consistent with obtaining informed consent. Here I argue that nudging is incompatible with genuine informed consent , as it violates a physician 's obligation to tell their patients the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth during adequate disclosure.
