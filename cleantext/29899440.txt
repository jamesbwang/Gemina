  It is unclear whether low levels of alcohol are harmful in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). We aimed to determine whether quantity , binge pattern consumption , or type of alcohol was associated with liver fibrosis<disease> in patients with NAFLD. Previous and current alcohol consumption was assessed in NAFLD patients undergoing liver biopsy. All subjects currently consumed < 210 g per week ( male) or < 140 g per week ( female). Binge consumption was defined as ≥ 4 standard drinks ( female) or ≥ 5 standard drinks ( male) in one sitting. Liver biopsies were scored according to the NASH CRN system with F3/4 fibrosis<disease> defined as advanced. Among 187 patients ( 24 % with advanced fibrosis<disease>) , the median weekly alcohol consumption was 20 ( 2.3-60) g over an average of 18 years. Modest consumption ( 1-70 g per week) was associated with lower mean fibrosis<disease> stage compared to lifetime abstainers ( p < 0.05) and a decreased risk of advanced fibrosis<disease> ( OR 0.33 , 95 % CI 0.14-0.78 , p = 0.01). The association with reduced fibrosis<disease> was not seen in subjects drinking in a binge-type fashion. Exclusive wine drinkers but not exclusive beer drinkers , had lower mean fibrosis<disease> stage and lower odds of advanced fibrosis<disease> ( OR 0.20 , 95 % CI 0.06-0.69 , p = 0.01) , compared to lifetime abstinent subjects. No interaction between gender and alcohol quantity , type , or binge consumption on fibrosis<disease> was observed. Modest ( 1-70 g per week) alcohol consumption , particularly wine in a non-binge pattern , is associated with lower fibrosis<disease> in patients with NAFLD. Prospective longitudinal studies into fibrosis<disease> progression , cardiovascular outcomes , and mortality are required before clinical recommendations can be made.
