  Lumacaftor/ivacaftor is a precision medicine targeting the defective cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> transmembrane regulator ( CFTR) protein in cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) patients homozygous for Phe508del genotype. Whilst there is evidence for efficacy in children aged 6-11 years who are stable with good lung function , there are little data about the use of this medication for children with acute deterioration in this age group. We describe the use of this drug to treat a child with an unusually severe exacerbation of CF lung disease and review the potential of lumacaftor/ivacaftor as a rescue therapy in the paediatric CF population.
