  Obesity and dyslipidemia are major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases ( CVD). Quercetin , a natural flavonoid , lowers plasma triglycerides ( TG) in human intervention studies , and its intake is associated with lower CVD risk. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which quercetin lowers plasma TG levels in diet-induced obesity. C57Bl/6J mice received a high-fat diet ( 45 % of calories derived from fat) with or without quercetin ( 0.1 %
