  For more than 40 years , lithium has been the gold standard in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorders. In the course of the last 15 years , other drugs have been approved in this indication and are widely used in clinical practice at the expense of lithium. New research from the last few years , however , indicates that lithium is still the first-line treatment in this indication. Against this background and lithium 's proven acute antimanic efficacy , we should perhaps be using lithium more regularly ( in combination with an atypical antipsychotic , if necessary) right from the start for the acute treatment of a manic episode and , once remission has been achieved and euthymia maintained during continuation treatment , to regularly taper off the atypical antipsychotic , if possible , and continue with lithium as monotherapy for prophylactic treatment. This might lead to lithium being used more consistently with the scientific evidence in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorders. It remains uncertain , however , to predict who will respond to and tolerate lithium prophylactically , and more research is needed to deliver the best possible individualized care to our patients.
