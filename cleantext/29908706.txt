  Oral surgery can be difficult in patients with chorea-like dyskinesia , which is common in those on long-term levodopa medication for Parkinson 's disease , and we know of no conclusive evidence to indicate whether conscious sedation with midazolam is effective in such cases. We report a patient in whom levodopa-induced chorea-like dyskinesia disappeared when midazolam was given intravenously for conscious sedation.
