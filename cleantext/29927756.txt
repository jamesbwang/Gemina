  As rising numbers of people are living with the long-term impact of cancer , digital health is playing an increasingly important role in the monitoring and support of survivors and their caregivers. This article reviews current evidence , practice and developments , and identifies emerging issues and opportunities. Digital health innovations , primarily using internet or smartphone-enabled applications , have been successfully developed , particularly in the areas of symptom management , decision-making , survivorship and follow-up care and palliative care. The research is characterized by much developmental activity , and evidence is accruing for efficacy and effectiveness. Opportunities afforded by digital health include timelier and patient-centred evidence-based care , offering improved clinical outcomes and independence. Barriers to implementation include lack of patient and professional engagement , perceived burden , depersonalization and missed care. There is much enthusiasm for the role of digital health in monitoring and providing support to cancer survivors , but further research is needed to establish clinical efficacy and understand the mechanisms for successful implementation in practice. The role of wearables , the internet of things and big data analytics is yet to be fully explored in supportive cancer care and may present new opportunities to enhance care and survivor experience.
