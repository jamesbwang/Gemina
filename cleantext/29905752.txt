  Selenoprotein K ( SELENOK) is primarily observed in the endoplasmic reticulum , and serves to maintain the normal physiological functions of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle development and regeneration are associated with significant changes in the expression of specific microRNAs ( miRNAs). Downregulated SELENOK expression is observed in chicken muscles deficient of Se. However , the mechanisms of miRNA regulation of SELENOK expression remain elusive. Here , deep sequencing was used to detect the miRNA profiles of muscle in Se deficient (- Se group) and normal ( C group) chickens. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was adopted to verify the relationship between SELENOK and gga-let-7f-3p. In addition , gga-let-7f-3p was either overexpressed or knocked-down in chicken myoblasts. Furthermore , the cells were treated with N-acetyl-l-cysteine ( NAC) or hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2) in order to probe the factors involved in oxidative stress , endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS) and apoptosis , respectively. Relative to the C group , there were 132 differentially expressed miRNAs ( including 57 upregulated and 75 downregulated) in the muscles of the- Se group. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that SELENOK was a primary target of gga-let-7f-3p. It was also observed that the overexpression or knock-down of gga-let-7f-3p significantly influenced the SELENOK expression. Moreover , NAC blocked mimics of ga-let-7f-3p , thus inducing oxidative stress , ERS and apoptosis. Simultaneously , gga-let-7f-3p inhibitors blocked the stimulant effects caused by H2O2 in chicken myoblasts. Furthermore , Se deficiency downregulated the SELENOK protein expression and induced oxidative stress , ERS and apoptosis in chicken muscles. In conclusion , the gga-let-7f-3p-SELENOK pathway played a pivotal role in Se deficiency mediated muscle injuries through the induction of oxidative stress and ERS , ultimately promoting apoptosis.
