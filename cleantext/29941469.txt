  Clinical performance of the novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I ( Siemens-hs-cTnI-Centaur) assay is unknown. We aimed to clinically validate the Siemens-hs-cTnI-Centaur assay and develop 0/1-h and 0/2-h algorithms. We enrolled patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction ( AMI). Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists including all clinical information twice: first , using serial hs-cTnT ( Roche-Elecsys , primary analysis); second , using hs-cTnI ( Abbott-Architect , secondary analysis) measurements in addition to the clinically applied ( hs)- cTn. Siemens-hs-cTnI-Centaur was measured at presentation , 1 h , and 2 h. The primary objective was a direct comparison of diagnostic accuracy , quantified by the area under the ROC curve ( AUC) , of Siemens-hs-cTnI-Centaur vs the 2 established hs-cTn assays ( Roche-hs-cTnT-Elecsys , Abbott-hs-cTnI-Architect). Secondary objectives included the development of Siemens-hs-cTnI-Centaur-specific 0/1-h and 0/2-h algorithms. AMI was the final diagnosis in 318 of 1755 ( 18 %) patients ( using Roche-hs-cTnT-Elecsys for adjudication). The AUC at presentation for Siemens-hs-cTnI-Centaur was 0.94 ( 95 % CI , 0.92-0.96) and comparable with 0.95 ( 95 % CI , 0.93-0.97) for Roche-hs-cTnT-Elecsys and 0.93 ( 95 % CI , 0.90-0.96) for Abbott-hs-cTnI-Architect. Applying the derived Siemens-hs-cTnI-Centaur 0/1-h algorithm to the validation cohort , 46 % of patients were ruled out ( sensitivity , 99.1 %; 95 % CI , 95.3-100) , and 18 % of patients were ruled in ( specificity , 94.1 %; 95 % CI , 91.8-95.9). The Siemens-hs-cTnI-Centaur 0/2-h algorithm ruled out 55 % of patients ( sensitivity , 100 %; 95 % CI , 94.1-100) , and ruled in 18 % of patients ( specificity , 96.0 %; 95 % CI , 93.1-97.9). Findings were confirmed in the secondary analyses using serial measurements of Abbott-hs-cTnI-Architect for adjudication. Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of the novel Siemens-hs-cTnI-Centaur assay are high and comparable with the established hs-cTn assays. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00470587.
