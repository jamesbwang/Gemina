  Anisometropic amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of the visual system. There is evidence that the neural deficits spread across visual areas , from the primary cortex up to higher brain areas , including motion coding structures such as MT. Here , we used bistable plaid motion to investigate changes in the underlying mechanisms of motion integration and segmentation and , thus , help us to unravel in more detail deficits in the amblyopic visual motion system. Our results showed that ( 1) amblyopes globally exhibited normal bistable perception in all viewing conditions compared to the control group and ( 2) decreased contrast led to a stronger increase in percept switches and decreased percept durations in the control group , while the amblyopic group exhibited no such changes. There were few differences in outcomes dependent upon the use of the weak eye , the strong eye , or both eyes for viewing the stimuli , but this was a general effect present across all subjects , not specific to the amblyopic group. To understand the role of noise and adaptation in such cases of bistable perception , we analyzed predictions from a model and found that contrast does indeed affect percept switches and durations as observed in the control group , in line with the hypothesis that lower stimulus contrast enhances internal noise effects. The combination of experimental and computational results presented here suggests a different motion coding mechanism in the amblyopic visual system , with relatively little effect of stimulus contrast on amblyopes ' bistable motion perception.
