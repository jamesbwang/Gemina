  Manipulation in the light regimes combined with the effects of plant growth regulators ( PGRs) and elicitors through plant cell culture technology is a promising strategy for enhancing the yield of medicinally important secondary metabolites. In this study , the effects of interplay between PGRs , elicitors and light regimes on cell cultures of F. indica<pathogen> have been investigated. The results showed that callus cultures resulted in maximum biomass formation ( 13.2 g/L) when incubated on solid MS ( Murashige and Skoog) medium<pathogen> containing 1.0 mg/L BA under continuous light for 4 weeks. Among the other PGRs , compared with the auxins such as 2,4-D , and IBA , TDZ resulted in higher biomass accumulation ( 12.1 g/L). Elicitors ( Me-J and PAA) resulted in a lower growth response , when compared with cytokinins and a higher response than auxins under all the light regimes on solid MS media. However , in liquid media , no significant increase in biomass was observed in response to the combined effects of PGRs and photoperiod regimes. Further , the highest phenolic content ( TPC = 6.8 mg) and flavonoid content ( TFC = 5.2 mg) were detected in the dark-grown cell cultures raised in vitro at 0.5 mg/L Me-J. The highest antioxidant activity ( 88 %) was recorded in the dark-grown cell cultures harvested from LOG phase of the growth cycle supplemented with 0.5 mg/L Me-J. Furthermore , BA resulted in considerable flavonoids production ( TFC = 4.7 mg) in the cell cultures grown under continuous light. However , overall dark treatment and elicitation with Me-J resulted in the optimal metabolic response in terms of secondary metabolites accumulation in cell suspension cultures of F.
