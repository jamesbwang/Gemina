  Luminescent solar concentrators ( LSCs) can serve as large-area sunlight collectors , are suitable for applications in high-efficiency and cost-effective photovoltaics ( PVs) , and provide adaptability to the needs of architects for building-integrated PVs , which makes them an attractive option for transforming buildings into transparent or non-transparent electricity generators. Compared with traditional organic dyes , colloidal semiconducting quantum dots ( QDs) are excellent candidates as emitters for LSCs because they exhibit wide size/shape/composition-tunable absorption spectra ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared , significantly overlapping with the solar spectrum. They also feature narrow emission spectra , high photoluminescence quantum yields , high absorption coefficients , solution processability and good photostability. Most importantly , QDs can be engineered to provide a minimal overlap between absorption and emission spectra , which is key to the realization of large-area LSCs with largely suppressed reabsorption energy losses. In this review article , we will first present and discuss the working principle of LSCs , the synthesis of colloidal QDs using wet-chemistry approaches , the optical properties of QDs , their band alignment and the intrinsic relationship between the band energy structure and optical properties of QDs. We focus on emerging architectures , such as core/shell QDs. We then highlight recent progress in QD-based LSCs and their anticipated applications. We conclude this review article with the major challenges and perspectives of LSCs in future commercial technologies.
