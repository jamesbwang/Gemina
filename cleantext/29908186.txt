  Cooperative cross-feeding , a resource-exchange mutualism between microbes , is ubiquitous; however , models suggest it should be susceptible to cheating. Recent work suggested two novel mechanisms that could allow cross-feeders to exclude cheaters , even in the absence of tight coupling between cooperative organisms. The first is pattern formation , where cross-feeders form regular patterns so that their resources are separated and cheaters can not obtain both. The second mechanism is neighbor uncertainty , where demographic stochasticity separates resources so cheaters can not obtain both. Here we use a stochastic spatial model to test whether those mechanisms are evolutionarily stable , or whether they will collapse under gradual evolution towards reduced resource production. The answer depends on whether a microbe can make the resource for itself without sharing it. If it can not ( i.e. if producing more of a resource means sharing more of a resource) , then both mechanisms continue to function. In this case , resource production directly benefits the individual , and cooperation is a byproduct. If microbes can make the resource without sharing it ( i.e. if production is an altruistic trait) , then neighbor uncertainty completely fails , and pattern formation is weakened. In this case , the costly trait has no direct benefit to the individual , and can only persist if cooperative organisms become associated with their partner. Thus , the novel mechanisms , which operate without tight associations , falter. These results have implications for synthetic ecology , as they suggest that how cross-feeding is engineered will impact its evolutionary stability.
