  Objectives Cardiovascular disease is the most common chronic health condition affecting Americans. One important group of Americans that health researchers have noted as key to understanding general population health and wellbeing are veterans of the US military. The healthy soldier effect has been used to explain the health benefits of military service during and for a period of time after service. The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in a national sample of veterans and non-veterans with specific attention paid to reported cardiovascular disease across ages. Methods A total of 150,067 veteran and non-veteran respondents from the National Health Interview Survey were examined for the likelihood of reporting the type and number of cardiovascular conditions. Results Veterans report higher rates of certain cardiovascular disease conditions and report a higher number of cardiovascular disease conditions compared to non-veterans. Veterans also reported higher numbers of cardiovascular disease conditions at younger ages ( ages 25-65) compared to non-veteran counterparts. At older ages ( ages 66 to 85 +) , non-veterans reported higher numbers of cardiovascular disease conditions compared to veterans. Discussion Our findings are consistent with research that indicates a waning healthy soldier effect for young veterans.
