  In 2013 , the Human<pathogen> Immunodeficiency<pathogen> Virus<pathogen> Organ Policy Equity ( HOPE) Act was passed to permit the conduct of research on the transplantation of organs from donors infected with human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) into recipients who are HIV-positive. The HOPE Act workshop had many objectives including the discussion of the ethical issues involved in HIV-positive to HIV-positive transplantation , the informed consent process , and the role of independent advocates in the context of HIV<pathogen> to HIV<pathogen> transplantation. As of 2018 , 22 transplant hospitals are approved , or undergoing approval , to perform HIV-positive to HIV-positive transplant surgeries , and this number is expected to grow. This study aims to: ( i) briefly review the history and research of HIV<pathogen> + transplantation prior to the HOPE Act , ( ii) describe the ethical principles supporting the HOPE Act , ( iii) characterize the informed consent process , and ( iv) provide guidance regarding the role of independent advocates in the context of HIV-positive to HIV-positive transplantation.
