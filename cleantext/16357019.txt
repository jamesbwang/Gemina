  Currently , studies assessing combined small-cell lung carcinoma ( C-SCLC) are relatively scarce and limited. Indeed the clinicopathological features , treatment , and prognosis of patients with C-SCLC have not been fully determined. The incidence of C-SCLC ranges from 5 % -28 % in different studies , which is related to the specimen types used. The clinical features of C-SCLC are characterized by the higher proportion of peripheral locations , earlier stage , and more opportunity to experience surgery. Surgery is more important for earlier stage C-SCLC. There have been no recent changes in the chemotherapy of C-SCLC , which is recommended by the treatment guidelines for SCLC , neither showing survival benefit from the 3-agent regimen. Meanwhile , the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs) in EGFR-mutated C-SCLC patients remains inconclusive. This review focuses on clinical and pathologic features , prognostic factors , and optimized treatment model in C-SCLC.
