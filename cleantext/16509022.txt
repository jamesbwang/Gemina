  Melanoma incidence continues to increase across many populations globally and there is significant mortality associated with advanced disease. However , if detected early , patients have a very promising prognosis. The methods that have been utilized for early detection include clinician and patient skin examinations , dermoscopy ( static and sequential imaging) , and total body photography via 2D imaging. Total body photography has recently witnessed an evolution from 2D imaging with the ability to now create a 3D representation of the patient linked with dermoscopy images of individual lesions<symptom>. 3D total body photography is a particularly beneficial screening tool for patients at high risk due to their personal or family history or those with multiple dysplastic naevi-the latter can make monitoring especially difficult without the assistance of technology. In this perspective , we discuss clinical examples utilizing 3D total body photography , associated advantages and limitations , and future directions of the technology. The optimal system for melanoma screening should improve diagnostic accuracy , be time and cost efficient , and accessible to patients across all demographic and socioeconomic groups. 3D total body photography has the potential to address these criteria and , most importantly , optimize crucial early detection.
