  Several research groups demonstrated that ` a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs ( ADAMTS) '- family proteases play roles in cancer progression. However , the origins and contributions of these proteases are not known. Here , we demonstrate an association between host-produced ADAMTS4 and early-stage tumor growth. Murine Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC) tumors showed marked expressions of Adamts4 and Adamts5. We examined the contributions and distributions of host-derived Adamts4 and Adamts5 on tumor growth , using Adamts4LacZ/LacZ and Adamts5LacZ/LacZ knockout mice. Interestingly , the Adamts4LacZ/LacZ mice showed enhanced tumor growth compared to wild-type mice at 5- , 10- and 12-days post-inoculation , whereas the Adamts5LacZ/LacZ mice did not show significant differences in tumor growth. We next examined LacZ distribution in LLC tumor-bearing Adamts4LacZ/LacZ mice by β-galactosidase ( β-gal) staining. We found that the β-gal-positive signals were strictly localized at the interior areas of the tumor at 10 days post-inoculation. Multiple staining demonstrated that most of the β-gal-positive cells were localized at the tumor vasculature in Adamts4LacZ/LacZ mice. Interestingly , β-gal-positive signals were not co-localized with biglycan after 10 days post-inoculation , excluding the biglycan cleavage by host-derived ADAMTS4. Taken together , these findings illustrate that host-derived ADAMTS4 was expressed at the tumor vessels and was associated with early-stage tumor growth.
