  This study aimed to assess ( 1) whether there were clinical , neuropsychological and functional differences between and within affective and non-affective psychoses at baseline and two years-follow-up and ( 2) to explore clinical and neuropsychological predictors of psychosocial functioning in the whole sample. This is a subanalysis from a multicentre , naturalistic , longitudinal prospective study ( ` Phenotype-genotype and environmental interaction. Application of a predictive model in first psychotic episodes '). The sample consisted of 192 patients with a first psychotic episode ( FEP): 142 with non-affective psychoses and 50 with affective psychoses. Student t-tests , paired t-tests , Pearson correlations , ANOVAs and regression analyses were performed. At baseline , the groups differed in perseverative errors ( WCST) , Premorbid Adjustment Scale ( PAS) , family history of psychiatric disorder , negative ( PANSS) and manic symptoms ( YMRS). At two years follow-up , the groups differed in all the PANSS subscales and in depressive symptoms assessed by the MADRS. When the whole sample was considered , the regression model which best explained the estimated variance in functioning at follow-up ( 41 %) was composed by PANSS total score and verbal fluency assessed by the FAS ( COWAT). We found clinical and neurocognitive differences at baseline which decreased in the follow-up. Reduced performances at baseline in executive functions in combination with symptom severity ( PANSS) were predictors of FEP patients ' poor functional outcome.
