  To estimate the prevalence , severity , and associated risk factors of gingival inflammation<symptom> in a group of adults from Kingston , Jamaica; Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic; and San Juan , Puerto Rico. In this representative cross-sectional study , participants completed medical and oral health questionnaires and received an oral clinical examination by trained and calibrated examiners. Clinical assessments included: gingival health ( modified LÃ¶e-Silness index) , visible plaque and presence of calculus. Findings were summarized as mean overall and interproximal gingival indices ( GI; IGI) , gingival bleeding index ( GBI) , gingival inflammation<symptom> prevalence ( GI > = 0.5) and severity ( mild , moderate , severe) , mean and interproximal visible plaque indices ( VPI; IVPI) , and calculus index. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between risk factors and gingival bleeding on probing ( BOP) at > = 40 % sites;. odds ratios were estimated. All 1,847 participants presented gingival inflammation<symptom>; most ( 81.9 %) had moderate<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. Mean GI , VPI , IVPI , and calculus indices were 1.49 , 0.94 , 0.96 , and 0.66 , respectively; most participants presented a VPI > = 30 %. BOP > = 40 % of sites was significantly associated with education ( ORmiddle/technical vs. university education = 1.61; p = 0.001 and ORnone/basic vs. university = 2.86; p < 0.001) , calculus index ( OR: 10.35) , VPI > = 30 % ( OR: 7.85; p < 0.001 for both) , and being a resident of Kingston or Santo Domingo ( vs. San Juan , OR: 4. 74 and OR: 7.09 , respectively) , after adjusting for age , gender , smoking , dental visit frequency , diabetes , and hypertension. Gingival inflammation<symptom> was highly prevalent. Most participants presented moderate gingival inflammation<symptom>. Educational attainment , dental calculus , and VPI > = 30 % were strongly associated with gingival
