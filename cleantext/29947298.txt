  The modern Japanese writing system comprises different scripts , such as Kanji , Hiragana , and Katakana. These scripts differ greatly in both typicality and frequency of usage. In two experimental studies using names of cities or prefectures in Japan as target stimuli , we examined two hypotheses , the typicality hypothesis and fluency hypothesis , in order to assess effects of Japanese script on psychological processes. It was found that Kanji names induced typical thinking in a participant 's description of a location , whereas Katakana names induced rather nontypical thinking. In contrast , we found that script differences did not affect distance estimations. We discuss these effects of Japanese script on psychological processes in terms of the typicality hypothesis ( differences in typical usage habits between Kanji and Katakana that affect psychological processes).
