  In almost 50 % of patients with drug-induced liver injury ( DILI) , the bile flow from the liver to the duodenum is impaired , a condition known as cholestasis. However , this toxic response only appears in a small percentage of the treated patients ( idiosyncrasy). Prediction of drug-induced cholestasis ( DIC) is challenging and emerges as a safety issue that requires attention by professionals in clinical practice , regulatory authorities , pharmaceutical companies , and research institutions. Area covered: The current synopsis focuses on the state-of-the-art in preclinical models for cholestatic DILI prediction. These models differ in their goal , complexity , availability , and applicability , and can widely be classified in experimental animals and in vitro models. Expert opinion: Drugs are a growing cause of cholestasis , but the progress made in explaining mechanisms and differences in susceptibility is not growing at the same rate. We need reliable models able to recapitulate the features of DIC , particularly its idiosyncrasy. The homogeneity and the species-specific differences move animal models away from a fair predictability. However , in vitro human models are improving and getting closer to the real hepatocyte phenotype , and they will likely be the choice in the near future. Progress in this area will not only need reliable predictive models but also mechanistic insights.
