  Tetanus<disease> remains a significant burden in many low- and middle-income countries. The tetanus<disease> toxin acts within the central nervous system and intrathecal antitoxin administration may be beneficial , but there are safety concerns , especially in resource-limited settings. We performed a pilot study to assess the safety and feasibility of intrathecal human tetanus<disease> immunoglobulin in five adults with tetanus<disease> before the conduct of a large randomized controlled trial. Intrathecal injection via lumbar puncture was given to all patients within a median 140 ( range 100-165) minutes of intensive care unit ( ICU) admission. There were no serious adverse effects associated with the procedure although three patients had probably related minor adverse events which resolved spontaneously. Median ICU length of stay was 14 ( range 5-17) days. Two patients required mechanical ventilation and one developed a deep vein thrombosis. Within 240 days of hospital discharge , no patients died and all patients returned to work.
