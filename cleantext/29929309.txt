  Photocatalytic degradation is an alternative method to remove pharmaceutical compounds from water , however it is hard to achieve efficient rate because of the low efficiency of photocatalysts. In this study , an efficient Z-Scheme photocatalyst was constructed by integrating graphitic carbon nitride ( CN) and reduced graphene oxide ( rGO) with AP via a simple facile precipitation method. Excitedly , ternary AP/rGO/CN composite showed superior photocatalytic and anti-photocorrosion performances under both intense sunlight and weak indoor light irradiation. NOF can be completely degraded in only 30 min and about 85 % of NOF can be mineralized after 2 h irradiation under intensive sunlight irradiation. rGO could work not only as a sheltering layer to protect AP from photocorrosion but also as a mediator for Z-Scheme electron transport , which can protect AP from the photoreduction. This strategy could be a promising method to construct photocatalytic system with high efficiency for the removal of antibiotics under natural light irradiation.
