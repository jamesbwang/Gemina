  From the standpoint of cancer therapy , it is valuable to enhance the anticancer effects of chemotherapy. Our previous reports revealed that up-regulation of heat-shock protein 27 ( HSP27) has been linked to gemcitabine resistance of pancreatic cancer cells. Enzyme-treated asparagus extract ( ETAS) is an extract that is produced from asparagus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ETAS on the expression of HSP27 and other HSPs in the gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line KLM1-R. KLM1-R cells were treated with ETAS , and expression levels of HSPs , including HSP27 , were investigated by western blotting. ETAS down-regulated HSP27 and pHSP27 ( serine 78) in KLM1-R cells , but , HSP70 and GRP78 levels were not altered. This study suggests the potential therapeutic benefit of ETAS in enhancing anticancer effects by its combination with gemcitabine for patients with pancreatic cancer.
