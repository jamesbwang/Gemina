  Thalamic white matter ( WM) injury in multiple sclerosis ( MS) remains relatively poorly understood. Combining multiple imaging modalities , sensitive to different tissue properties , may aid in further characterizing thalamic damage. Forty-five MS patients and 17 demographically-matched healthy controls ( HC) were scanned with 3T MRI to obtain quantitative measures of diffusivity and magnetic susceptibility. Participants underwent cognitive evaluation with the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis battery. Tract-based spatial statistics identified thalamic WM. Non-parametric combination ( NPC) analysis was used to perform joint inference on fractional anisotropy ( FA) , mean diffusivity ( MD) and magnetic susceptibility measures. The association of surrounding WM lesions<symptom> and thalamic WM pathology was investigated with lesion<symptom> probability mapping. Compared to HCs , the greatest extent of thalamic WM damage was reflected by the combination of increased MD and decreased magnetic susceptibility ( 63.0 % of thalamic WM , peak p = .001). Controlling for thalamic volume resulted in decreased FA and magnetic susceptibility ( 34.1 % , peak p = .004) as showing the greatest extent. In MS patients , the most widespread association with information processing speed was found with the combination of MD and magnetic susceptibility ( 67.6 % , peak p = .0005) , although this was not evident after controlling for thalamic volume. For memory measures , MD alone yielded the most widespread associations ( 45.9 % , peak p = .012 or 76.7 % , peak p = .001) , even after considering thalamic volume , albeit with smaller percentages. White matter lesions<symptom> were related to decreased FA ( peak p = .0063) and increased MD ( peak p = .007) , but not magnetic susceptibility , of thalamic WM. Our study highlights the complex nature of thalamic pathology in MS.
