  Developmental prosopagnosia ( DP) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe deficits with facial identity recognition. It is unclear which cortical areas contribute to face processing deficits in DP , and no previous studies have investigated whether other category-selective areas function normally in DP. To address these issues , we scanned 22 DPs and 27 controls using a dynamic localizer consisting of video clips of faces , scenes , bodies , objects , and scrambled objects. We then analyzed category selectivity , a measure of the tuning of a cortical area to a particular visual category. DPs exhibited reduced face selectivity in all 12 face areas , and the reductions were significant in three posterior and two anterior areas. DPs and controls showed similar responses to faces in other category-selective areas , which suggests the DPs ' behavioral deficits with faces result from problems restricted to the face network. DPs also had pronounced scene-selectivity reductions in four of six scene-selective areas and marginal body-selectivity reductions in two of four body-selective areas. Our results demonstrate that DPs have widespread deficits throughout the face network , and they are inconsistent with a leading account of DP which proposes that posterior face-selective areas are normal in DP. The selectivity reductions in other category-selective areas indicate many DPs have deficits spread across high-level visual cortex.
