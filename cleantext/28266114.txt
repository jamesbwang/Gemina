  Oral health represents an essential component in the quality of life of people , being a determinant factor in general health since it may affect the risk of suffering other conditions , such as chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. Oral diseases have become one of the main public health problems , where dental<disease> caries<disease> is the condition that most affects oral health worldwide , occurring in about 90 % of the global population. This condition has been considered a challenge because of its high prevalence , besides being a chronic but preventable disease which can be caused depending on the consumption of certain nutritional elements interacting simultaneously with different factors , such as socioeconomic factors. Based on this problem , an analysis of a set of 189 dietary and demographic determinants is performed in this work , in order to find the relationship between these factors and the oral situation of a set of subjects. The oral situation refers to the presence and absence/restorations of caries<disease>. The methodology is performed constructing a dense artificial neural network ( ANN) , as a computer-aided diagnosis tool , looking for a generalized model that allows for classifying subjects. As validation , the classification model was evaluated through a statistical analysis based on a cross validation , calculating the accuracy , loss function , receiving operating characteristic ( ROC) curve and area under the curve ( AUC) parameters. The results obtained were statistically significant , obtaining an accuracy â‰ƒ 0.69 and AUC values of 0.69 and 0.75. Based on these results , it is possible to conclude that the classification model developed through the deep ANN is able to classify subjects with absence of caries<disease> from subjects with presence or restorations with high accuracy , according to their demographic and dietary factors.
