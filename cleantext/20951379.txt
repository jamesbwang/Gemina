  Preterm birth leads to multiple morbidities affecting the health of a child. Lack of information on the health impact of prematurity hinders the possibility of any effective public health interventions in this regard. Our aim was to determine the association between preterm birth and Health-Related Quality of Life ( HRQOL) among 3 years old children in the Gampaha district , Sri Lanka. A community-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 790 preterm and term born children who were 03 years old. Multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used to identify children. The exposure status , a preterm birth , was established using the maternal pregnancy records. Outcome status was measured using a validated health related quality of life questionnaire ( prepared in Sinhala) for preschool-aged children. Mothers of the children responded to an interviewer-administered questionnaire which had variables on the exposure status , outcome and additional variables such as child development status and birth related information. Quality of life was measured in twelve different domains of health ( subscales). The impact was analyzed using the multiple linear regression. Response rate was 95.5 % ( n = 379) for preterm group and 95.2 % ( n = 378) for term-born group. Health-Related Quality of Life scores obtained by preterm children were lower than the term born children in eight subscales. Preterm birth showed statistically significant association with subscales on sleep wellbeing , general wellbeing and abdominal<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in the adjusted analysis ( p < 0.05). Among preterm children prolonged illness , delayed development status , socio economic status and maternal perception on the health status of the child were common predictors of quality of life. Preterm birth affected health related quality of life of preschool aged children.
