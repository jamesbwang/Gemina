  Ginkgolide K ( GK) is a new compound extracted from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba , which has been recognized to exert anti-oxidative stress and neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke. While whether it plays an enhanced effect on angiogenesis during ischemic stroke remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ginkgolide K on promoting angiogenesis as well as the protective mechanism after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Using the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion ( tMCAO) mouse model , we found that GK ( 3.5 , 7.0 , 14.0 mg/kg , i.p. , bid. , 2 weeks) attenuated neurological impairments , and promoted angiogenesis of injured ipsilateral cortex and striatum<pathogen> after 14 days of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in mice. Further , GK ( 3.5 mg/kg in vivo , 10 μM in vitro) significantly up-regulated the expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF in tMCAO mouse brains and in b End3 cells after OGD/R , and GK-induced upregulation of HIF-1α and VEGF in b End3 cells could be abolished by JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor AG490. Our results demonstrate that GK promotes angiogenesis after ischemia stroke through increasing the expression of HIF-1α/ VEGF via JAK2/STAT3 pathway , which provide an insight into the novel clinical application of GK and its analogs in ischemic stroke therapy in future.
