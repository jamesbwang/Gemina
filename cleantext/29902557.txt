  Our aim was to assess with positron emission tomography ( PET) the temporal and spatial inter-relationships between levels of cortical microglial activation and the aggregated amyloid-β and tau load in mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) and early Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Six clinically probable AD and 20 MCI subjects had inflammation<symptom> ( 55 % of MCI and 83 % of AD subjects had a high amyloid-β load. We have previously reported that clusters of correlated amyloid and inflammation<symptom> levels are present in cortex. Here we found no correlation between levels of inflammation<symptom> ( While correlated levels of amyloid-β and inflammation<symptom> can be seen in MCI , we did not detect an association between levels of cortical tau tangles and inflammation<symptom> in our series of high amyloid-β cases. High levels of inflammation<symptom> could be seen in amyloid-β positive MCI cases where
