  Excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS) is a significant public health concern , with sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB) being a common cause. However , their precise relationship in patients with cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is unclear. Furthermore , whether comorbid psychological disorders could contribute to EDS remains unknown. We aimed to assess the prevalence of EDS and its related factors , including SDB and depression<symptom> , in patients with CVD.Methods and Results: We analyzed data from 1,571 patients admitted for various CVDs in a single university hospital ( median age , 67 ( 56-76) years; 29.6 % women). We assessed EDS using the Japanese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS; median 6.0 ( 4.0-9.0)). The presence of EDS ( ESS > 10 , n = 297 ( 18.9 %)) did not differ between patients with and without SDB , which was screened with nocturnal pulse oximetry. In contrast , the patients with EDS had higher depression<symptom> scores ( Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale subscore for depression<symptom> ( HADS-D) and Patient Healthcare Questionnaire ( PHQ) -9). The depression<symptom> scores , measured by HADS-D ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.14; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.07-1.22) and PHQ-9 ( OR , 1.14; 95 % CI , 1.07-1.20) were independent determinants of EDS. These relationships among EDS , SDB , and depression<symptom> were consistent among the subgroups with cardiovascular comorbidities. The presence of EDS is associated with depressive symptoms , but not with SDB , in patients with CVD , suggesting that these patients should be thoroughly assessed for psychological disturbances.
