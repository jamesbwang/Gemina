  Collision-coalescence growth of noninertial particles in three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence is studied. Smoluchowski 's coagulation equation describes the evolution of the size distribution of particles in this system. By applying a methodology based on turbulence theory , the equation is shown to have a steady-state solution , which corresponds to the Kolmogorov-type power-law spectrum. Direct numerical simulations of turbulence and Lagrangian particles are conducted. The result shows that the size distribution in a statistically steady state agrees accurately with the theoretical prediction.
