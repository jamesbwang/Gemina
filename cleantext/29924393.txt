  Little is currently known about nutrition intake and energy requirements in the post-intensive care unit ( ICU) hospitalization period in critically ill patients. We aimed to describe energy and protein intake , and determine the feasibility of measuring energy expenditure during the post-ICU hospitalization period in critically ill adults. This is a nested cohort study within a randomized controlled trial in critically ill patients. After discharge from ICU , energy and protein intake was quantified periodically and indirect calorimetry attempted. Data are presented as n ( %) , mean ( SD) , and median ( interquartile range ( IQR)). Thirty-two patients were studied in the post-ICU hospitalization period , and 12 had indirect calorimetry. Mean age and BMI was 56 ( 18) years and 30 ( 8) kg/m Energy and protein intake in the post-ICU hospitalization period was less than estimated and measured energy requirements. Oral nutrition provided alone was the most common mode of nutrition therapy.
