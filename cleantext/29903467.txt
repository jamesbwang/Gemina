  Current modulator therapies for some cystic fibrosis-causing CFTR mutants , including N1303K , have limited efficacy. We provide evidence here to support combination potentiator ( co-potentiator) therapy for mutant CFTRs that are poorly responsive to single potentiators. Functional synergy screens done on N1303K and W1282X CFTR , in which small molecules were tested with VX-770 , identified arylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine , phenoxy-benzimidazole and flavone co-potentiators. A previously identified arylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine co-potentiator ( ASP-11) added with VX-770 increased N1303K-CFTR current 7-fold more than VX-770 alone. ASP-11 increased by ~ 65 % of the current of G551D-CFTR compared to VX-770 , was additive with VX-770 on F508del-CFTR , and activated wild-type CFTR in the absence of a cAMP agonist. ASP-11 efficacy with VX-770 was demonstrated in primary CF human airway cell cultures having N1303K , W1282X and G551D CFTR mutations. Structure-activity studies on 11 synthesized ASP-11 analogs produced compounds with EC These studies support combination potentiator therapy for CF caused by some CFTR mutations that are not effectively treated by single potentiators.
