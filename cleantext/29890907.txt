  Hip revision surgery is associated with a high probability of the necessity for a blood transfusion. Different studies support the use of tranexamic acid ( TXA) to decrease the rate of transfusions in primary hip surgery. Nevertheless , the use of this drug in hip revision surgery has not yet been widely accepted. The aim of our study was to establish the rate of blood transfusion with and without TXA in hip revision surgery. We retrospectively studied 125 hip revision surgery patients operated on between 2011 and 2014. We divided our series into 2 groups: the TXA group with 61 patients ( in which a 1000 mg dose of TXA was used before the skin incision and a second identical dose after skin closure) and a control group with 64 patients. We analysed the red blood cell ( RBC) transfusion rates and their odds risk as well as the presence of collateral complications. Average RBC transfusion was 2.7 units/patient ( range 0-6) in the control group compared to 1.6 units/patient ( range 0-6) in the TXA group. A 90.11 % ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.098; confidence interval ( CI) 0.02-0.04; p < 0.0029) odds risk reduction for transfusion of at least 1 unit of erythrocyte blood cell was observed in the TXA group. Complications associated with the TXA were similar in both groups. The benefits of TXA have been shown in elective hip replacement. In this study , TXA proved to be safe and efficacious in reducing the need for transfusions following revision total hip arthroplasty.
