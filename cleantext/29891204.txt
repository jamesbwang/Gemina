  Despite the strong interest in combining stereotactic ablative radiation therapy ( SAR) with immunotherapy , limited data characterizing the systemic immune response after SAR are available. We hypothesized that the systemic immune response to SAR would differ by irradiated site owing to inherent differences in the microenvironment of various organs. Patients receiving SAR to any organ underwent prospective blood banking before and 1 to 2 weeks after SAR. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) and serum were isolated. PBMCs were stained with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies against T and natural killer ( NK) cell markers. Cells were interrogated by flow cytometry , and the results were analyzed using FlowJo software. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels were measured using Luminex. We analyzed the changes from before to after therapy using paired t tests or 1-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) with Bonferroni 's post-test. A total of 31 patients had evaluable PBMCs for flow cytometry and 37 had evaluable serum samples for Luminex analysis. The total number of NK cells and cytotoxic ( CD56 Our data suggest SAR to parenchymal sites induces systemic immune changes , including a decrease in total and cytotoxic NK cells , an increase in TIM3
