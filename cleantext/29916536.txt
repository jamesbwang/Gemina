  Recently , microRNA ( miR) 590‑5p has been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis in colorectal and breast cancer; however , its function in osteosarcoma ( OS) requires further investigation. In the present study miR‑590‑5p expression was poorly expressed in OS samples and cell lines when compared with that observed in normal cells. In addition , overexpression of miR‑590‑5p significantly reduced the proliferation , migration and invasion of SAOS2 and U2OS cells in vitro , as well as inhibiting tumor sizes in vivo. The results revealed that miR‑590‑5p directly targeted Kruppel‑like factor 5 ( KLF5) in SAOS2 and U2OS cells. Their expression was inversely correlated with OS tissues. Finally , it was demonstrated that overexpression of KLF5 rescued the inhibitory effects of miR‑590‑5p on cell proliferation , migration and invasion. Overall , the results of the present study suggested that the miR‑590‑5p/ KLF5 axis may regulate OS progression and thus , may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with OS.
