  In this study , we established a rapid and efficient HPLC method to determine the accumulation of Huperzine A and Huperzine B in the fermentation broth of endophytic fungus Colletotrichum<pathogen> gloesporioides from Huperzia serrate. The chloroform extracts of fermentation broth were dissolved in methanol and filtered before injection for HPLC analysis. The analysis was performed on an Agilent Eclipse plus-C18 column ( 250 mm × 4.6 mm , 5 μm) by isocratic elution. The mobile phase was 0.015 mol/L ammonium acetate-methanol ( 70:30 , V/V) , the flow rate was 1 mL/min and the detection wavelength was set at 308 nm. Huperzine A and Huperzine B could be well separated within 25 min. Good linearity of Huperzine A was found in the range of 1.50-48.00 μg/mL ( r = 0.999 5) , and that of huperzine B was in 0.25-7.50 μg/mL ( r = 0.999 7). The average recoveries of Huperzine A and Huperzine B were 106.83 % and 108.06 % , respectively ( RSD = 3.34 % , 3.60 %). The results demonstrate that this method can detect the content of huperzine A and huperzine B in fermentation broth simply , rapidly , accurately and in good reproducibility. Under the optimized conditions , the accumulated content of huperzine A and huperzine B were measured from the sixth to the fifteenth day. Huperzine A and Huperzine B reached the highest ( 12.417 0 μg/mL and 4.660 3 μg/mL , respectively) at the fourteenth and eighth days. The analysis methodology could contribute to the future study of huperzine A and huperzine B biosynthesis in C.<pathogen> gloeosporioides<pathogen> , consequently facilitate the development of new drug resources.
