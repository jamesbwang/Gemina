  The conventional technique for the fabrication of complete dentures is complex , with a long fabrication process and difficult-to-control restoration quality. In recent years , digital complete denture design has become a research focus. Digital complete denture tooth arrangement is a challenging issue that is difficult to efficiently implement under the constraints of complex tooth arrangement rules and the patient 's individualized functional aesthetics. The present study proposes a complete denture automatic tooth arrangement method driven by a reconfigurable rule; it uses four typical operators , including a position operator , a scaling operator , a posture<symptom> operator , and a contact operator , to establish the constraint mapping association between the teeth and the constraint set of the individual patient. By using the process reorganization of different constraint operators , this method can flexibly implement different clinical tooth arrangement rules. When combined with a virtual occlusion algorithm based on progressive iterative Laplacian deformation , the proposed method can achieve automatic and individual tooth arrangement. Finally , the experimental results verify that the proposed method is flexible and efficient.
