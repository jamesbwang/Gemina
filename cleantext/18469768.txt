  To evaluate the accuracy of a model made using the computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture ( CAD/CAM) milling method and 3D printing method and to confirm its applicability as a work model for dental prosthesis production. First , a natural tooth model ( ANA-4 , Frasaco , Germany) was scanned using an oral scanner. The obtained scan data were then used as a CAD reference model ( CRM) , to produce a total of 10 models each , either using the milling method or the 3D printing method. The 20 models were then scanned using a desktop scanner and the CAD test model was formed. The accuracy of the two groups was compared using dedicated software to calculate the root mean square ( RMS) value after superimposing CRM and CAD test model ( CTM). The RMS value ( 152 ± 52 µm) of the model manufactured by the milling method was significantly higher than the RMS value ( 52 ± 9 µm) of the model produced by the 3D printing method. The accuracy of the 3D printing method is superior to that of the milling method , but at present , both methods are limited in their application as a work model for prosthesis manufacture.
