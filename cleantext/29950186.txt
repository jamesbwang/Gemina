  The impact of obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) on objective indicators of labour market marginalisation has not been quantified. Linking various Swedish national registers , we estimated the risk of three labour market marginalisation outcomes ( receipt of newly granted disability pension , long-term sickness absence and long-term unemployment) in individuals diagnosed with OCD between 2001 and 2013 who were between 16 and 64 years old at the date of the first OCD diagnosis ( n = 16 267) , compared with matched general population controls ( n = 157 176). Hazard ratios ( HR) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) were calculated using Cox regression models , adjusting for a number of covariates ( e.g. somatic disorders) and stratifying by sex. To adjust for potential familial confounders , we further analysed data from 7905 families that included full siblings discordant for OCD. Patients were more likely to receive at least one outcome of interest ( adjusted HR = 3.63 ( 95 % CI 3.53-3.74)) , including disability pension ( adjusted HR = 16.36 ( 95 % CI 15.34-17.45)) , being on long-term sickness absence ( adjusted HR = 3.07 ( 95 % CI 2.95-3.19)) and being on long-term unemployment ( adjusted HR = 1.72 ( 95 % CI 1.63-1.82)). Results remained similar in the adjusted sibling comparison models. Exclusion of comorbid psychiatric disorders had a minimal impact on the results. Help-seeking individuals with OCD diagnosed in specialist care experience marked difficulties to participate in the labour market. The findings emphasise the need for cooperation between policy-makers , vocational rehabilitation and mental health services in order to design and implement specific strategies aimed at improving the patients ' participation in the labour market.
