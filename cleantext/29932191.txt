  We report the magnetic field and particle-concentration dependent steady-state shear-responses of rod shaped Li-Zn ferrite particle based magnetorheological fluids ( MRFs). Rod-shaped soft ferrimagnetic Li-Zn ferrite ( Li0 .4 Zn0 .2 Fe2 .4 O4) particles were synthesized using the combustion synthesis method. MRFs of three different particle-concentrations ( φ = 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.4 , in weight fraction) were prepared using silicone oil. Their yield strength and dynamic viscosity were studied at different applied magnetic fields ( B). With an increase in B and φ , the yield strength ( τY) of the MRFs increases. This behaviour is assigned to the formation of stronger columnar structures of the magnetically interacting particles which resist the flow ( shear) of the MRF. For the MRF with φ = 0.4 and B = 1.2 T , we observed a maximum τY value of ∼ 1.25 kPa. Furthermore , we observed that , based on the on-state to off-state viscosity ratio ( ηon/ηoff) at a particular operating B value , the optimum particle concentration required for energy- and cost-efficient operation of the MRFs can be chosen. The absence of a stabilizing-agent or de-agglomerating-coating , the low density , and the excellent oxidation- and corrosion-resistance of the soft ferrimagnetic rod-shaped Li-Zn ferrite particles make this MRF-system highly versatile and economical for many magneto-mechanical applications.
