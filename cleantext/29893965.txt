  We aimed to elucidate the place of dynamic 18F-FET-PET in prognostic models of gadolinium ( Gd)- negative gliomas. In 98 patients with Gd-negative gliomas undergoing 18F-FET-PET guided biopsy , time activity curves ( TAC) of each tumor were qualitatively categorized as either increasing or decreasing. Additionally , post-hoc quantitative analyses were done using minimal time-to-peak ( TTPmin) measurements. Prognostic factors were obtained from multivariate hazards models. The fit of the biospecimen- and imaging-derived models was compared. A homogeneous increasing , mixed , and homogeneous decreasing TAC pattern was seen in 51 , 19 , and 28 tumors , respectively. Mixed TAC tumors exhibited both increasing and decreasing TACs. Corresponding adjusted 5-years survival was 85 % , 47 % , and 19 % , respectively ( p < 0.001). Qualitative and quantitative TAC measurements were highly inter-correlated ( p < 0.0001): TTPmin was longest ( shortest) in the homogeneous increasing ( decreasing) TAC group and in between in the mixed TAC group. TTPmin was longer in IDH-mutant tumors ( p < 0.001). Outcome was similarly precisely predicted by biospecimen- and imaging-derived models. In the biospecimen model , WHO grade ( p < 0.0001) and IDH status ( p < 0.001) were predictors for survival. Outcome of homogeneous increasing ( homogeneous decreasing) TAC tumors was nearly identical with both TTPmin > 25 min ( TTPmin ≤ 12.5 min) tumors and IDH-mutant grade II ( IDH-wildtype) gliomas. Outcome of mixed TAC tumors matched that of both intermediate TTPmin ( > 12.5 min and ≤ 25 min) and IDH-mutant , grade III gliomas. Each of the three prognostic clusters differed significantly from the other ones of the respective models ( p < 0.001). TAC measurements constitute a powerful biomarker independent from tumor grade and IDH status.
