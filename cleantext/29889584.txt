  To investigate , in patients after stroke with a very weak upper limb , the profile of recovery for upper limb activity over the first 12 weeks , and whether early secondary impairments predict later upper limb activity. Forty patients within 2 weeks of stroke with a very weak upper limb ( < 4/6 Item 6 of Motor Assessment Scale) were observed longitudinally. Upper<symptom> limb activity ( Items 6 , 7 , and 8 of Motor Assessment Scale) , shoulder subluxation ( vertical distance) , shoulder pain ( visual analogue scale) , and upper limb range of motion were measured at 2 , 6 , and 12 weeks poststroke. By Week 12 , upper limb activity was 1.0/ 18 ( IQR 3.0). Shoulder subluxation was 42 mm ( SD 8) , 7 mm > the intact side at 2 weeks. Pain at rest was 0.1/ 10 ( IQR 1.1) , and pain during movement was 2.6/ 10 ( IQR 4.5). Passive shoulder external rotation was 23 Â° ( SD 34) , 30 % of the intact side at 2 weeks. Shoulder pain during movement at 2 weeks predicted shoulder pain during movement at 6 and 12 weeks after stroke ( p = 0.05). Most patients with a disabled upper limb after stroke have little recovery of activity in the first 12 weeks. Shoulder pain on movement at 2 weeks should be flagged as a predictor of future pain.
