  Quantitative susceptibility mapping ( QSM) and effective transverse relaxation rate ( R2 *) mapping are both highly sensitive to variations in brain iron content. Clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI) studies report changes of susceptibilities and relaxation rates in various neurological diseases which are often equated with changes in regional brain iron content. However , these mentioned metrics lack specificity for iron , since they are also influenced by the presence of myelin. In this study , we assessed the extent to which QSM and R2 * reflect iron concentration as well as histological iron and myelin intensities. Six unfixed human post-mortem brains were imaged in situ with a 7 T MRI scanner. After formalin fixation , the brains were sliced axially and punched. 671 tissue punches were subjected to ferrozine iron quantification. Subsequently , brain slices were embedded in paraffin , and histological double-hemispheric axial brain slices were stained for Luxol fast blue ( myelin) and diaminobenzidine ( DAB)- enhanced Turnbull blue ( iron). 3331 regions of interest ( ROIs) were drawn on the histological stainings to assess myelin and iron intensities , which were compared with MRI data in corresponding ROIs. QSM more closely reflected quantitative ferrozine iron values ( r = 0.755 vs. 0.738) , whereas R2 * correlated better with iron staining intensities ( r = 0.619 vs. 0.445). Myelin intensities correlated negatively with QSM ( r = -0.352) , indicating a diamagnetic effect of myelin on susceptibility. Myelin intensities were higher in the thalamus than in the basal ganglia. A significant relationship was nonetheless observed between quantitative iron values and QSM , confirming the applicability of the latter in this brain region for iron quantification.
