  Drug-induced gingival enlargement ( DIGE) is a fibrotic condition associated with systemic administration of the anti-epileptic drug , phenytoin. We have previously demonstrated that periostin , which is transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-β) inducible gene , is upregulated in various fibrotic conditions including gingival enlargement associated with nifedipine. The objective of this study was to assess periostin expression in phenytoin-induced gingival enlargement ( PIGE) tissues and to investigate the mechanisms underlying periostin expression. Human PIGE tissues were assessed using Masson 's trichrome , with cell infiltration and changes in extracellular matrix composition characterized through labeling with antibodies to periostin , phospho-SMAD 3 , TGF-β , as well as the macrophage markers CD68 and RM3/1. Using human gingival fibroblasts ( HGFs) in vitro we examined the pathways through which phenytoin acts on fibroblasts. In PIGE tissues , which demonstrate altered collagen organization and increased inflammatory cell infiltration , periostin protein was increased compared with healthy tissues. p-SMAD2/ 3 , the transcription factor associated with canonical TGF-β signaling , is localized to the nuclei in both gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelial cells in PIGE tissues , but not in healthy tissue. In vitro culture of HGFs with 15 and 30 μg/ml of phenytoin increased periostin protein levels , which correlated with p-SMAD3 phosphorylation. Inhibition of canonical TGF-β signaling with SB431542 significantly reduced phenytoin induction of SMAD3 phosphorylation and periostin expression in HGFs. Analysis of PIGE tissues showed a subset of CD68 stained macrophages were TGF-β positive and that RM1/3 regenerative macrophages were present in the tissues. Our results demonstrate that phenytoin up-regulates periostin in HGFs in a TGF-β-dependent manner.
