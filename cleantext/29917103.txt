  Sustainable intensification of land-use practices has never been more important to ensure food security for a growing world population. When combined under thoughtful management , cover cropping and crop-livestock integration under no-till systems can benefit from unexpected synergies due to their unique features of plant-animal diversification and complex agroecosystem functions. Mimicking the nutrient coupling/decoupling processes of natural ecosystems by diversifying plant and animal components of no-till integrated crop-livestock operations is an essential feature of the design of agroecological systems that support self-regulating feedbacks and lend resilience while increasing productivity and ecosystem service provision. Focusing on grazing animals as drivers of agroecosystem change , we highlight the benefits of grazed cover crops in rotation with cash crops for primary and secondary production and for soil physical , chemical , and biological parameters. However , careful management of grazing intensity is imperative; overgrazing drives soil deterioration , while light to moderate grazing enhances overall system functioning and allows for the generation of emergent properties.
