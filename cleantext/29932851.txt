  This article explores the potential of complex adaptive systems theory to inform behaviour change research. A complex adaptive system describes a collection of heterogeneous agents interacting within a particular context , adapting to each other 's actions. In practical terms , this implies that behaviour change is 1) socially and culturally situated; 2) highly sensitive to small baseline differences in individuals , groups , and intervention components; and 3) determined by multiple components interacting `` chaotically ''. Two approaches to studying complex adaptive systems are briefly reviewed. Agent-based modelling is a computer simulation technique that allows researchers to investigate `` what if '' questions in a virtual environment. Applied qualitative research techniques , on the other hand , offer a way to examine what happens when an intervention is pursued in real-time , and to identify the sorts of rules and assumptions governing social action. Although these represent very different approaches to complexity , there may be scope for mixing these methods- for example , by grounding models in insights derived from qualitative fieldwork. Finally , I will argue that the concept of complex adaptive systems offers one opportunity to gain a deepened understanding of health-related practices , and to examine the social psychological processes that produce health-promoting or damaging actions.
