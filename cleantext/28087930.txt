  Understanding the mechanisms underlying wood decay basidiomycete community dynamics is crucial for fully understanding decomposition processes , and for modelling ecosystem function and resilience to environmental change. Competition drives community development in decaying woody resources , with interactions occurring at a distance , following physical contact , and through specialised relationships such as mycoparasitism. Outcomes of combative interactions range from replacement , where one mycelium displaces another , to deadlock , where neither combatant captures territory from the other; and a spectrum of intermediate outcomes ( i.e. partial or mutual replacement) lie between these extremes. Many wood decay basidiomycetes coexist within a resource , in a complex and dynamic community , and new research techniques are focussing on spatial orientation of interactions in 3 dimensions , as opposed to historical two-dimensional research. Not only do interactions drive changes in species composition and thus wood decomposition rate , they also may have industrial applications in biocontrol of pathogenic or nuisance fungi<pathogen> , enzyme production , and in the production of novel antifungals and antibiotics. Altogether , fungal interactions are a fascinating and important field of study.
