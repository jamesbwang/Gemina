  Hemangioblastoma is composed of neoplastic stromal cells and a prominent capillary network. To date , the identity of stromal cells remains unclear. Mesenchymal stem cells can give rise to committed vascular progenitor cells , and ephrin-B2/ EphB4 and Notch signaling have crucial roles in these steps. The aim of our study was to elucidate that stromal cells of central nervous system hemangioblastomas have mesenchymal stem cell-derived vascular progenitor cell properties. Ten hemangioblastomas were investigated immunohistochemically. CD44 , a mesenchymal stem cell marker , was detected in stromal cells of all cases , suggesting that stromal cells have mesenchymal stem cell-like properties. Neither CD31 nor Î±-SMA was expressed in stromal cells , suggesting that stromal cells have not acquired differentiated vascular cell properties. Both ephrin-B2 and EphB4 , immature vascular cell markers , were detected in stromal cells of all cases. Jagged1 , Notch1 , and Hesr2/Hey2 , which are known to be detected in both immature endothelial cells and mural cells , were expressed in stromal cells of all cases. Notch3 , which is known to be detected in differentiating mural cells , was also expressed in all cases. These results suggest that stromal cells also have vascular progenitor cell properties. In conclusion , stromal cells of hemangioblastomas exhibit mesenchymal stem cell-derived vascular progenitor cell properties.
