  Bent N , N '- diphenyl-dihydrodibenzo ( a , c) phenazine amphiphiles are introduced as mechanosensitive membrane probes that operate by an unprecedented mechanism , namely , unbending in the excited state as opposed to the previously reported untwisting in the ground and twisting in the excited state. Their dual emission from bent or `` closed '' and planarized or `` open '' excited states is shown to discriminate between micelles in water and monomers in solid-ordered ( S
