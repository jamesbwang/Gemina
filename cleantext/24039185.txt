  To investigate the location to which a pancreatic stent should be inserted to prevent post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP) pancreatitis<disease> ( PEP). Over a ten-year period at our hospital , 296 patients underwent their first ERCP procedure and had a pancreatic stent inserted; this study included 147 patients who had ERCP performed primarily for biliary investigation and had a pancreatic stent inserted to prevent PEP. We divided these patients into two groups: 131 patients with a stent inserted into the pancreatic head ( head group) and 16 patients with a stent inserted up to the pancreatic body or tail ( body/tail group). Patient characteristics and ERCP factors were compared between the groups. Pancreatic amylase isoenzyme ( p-AMY) levels in the head group were significantly higher than those in the body/tail group ( 138.5 ( 7.0-2086) Stent insertion up to the pancreatic body or tail reduces the risk of post-ERCP hyperamylasemia and may reduce the risk of PEP.
