  Chemical optimization of pyrazolopyridine 1 , focused on cellular potency , isoform selectivity and microsomal stability , led to the discovery of the potent , selective and orally available PI3KÎ´ inhibitor 5d. On the basis of its desirable potency , selectivity and pharmacokinetic profiles , 5d was tested in the trinitrophenylated aminoethylcarboxymethyl-Ficoll ( TNP-Ficoll)- induced antibody production model , and showed higher antibody inhibition than a 4-fold oral dose of the starting compound 1. These excellent results suggest that 5d is a potential candidate for further studies in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and leukocyte malignancies.
