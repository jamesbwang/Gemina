  The Tape Locking Screw ( TLS This was a prospective single-center , single-surgeon study performed on patients operated between December 2014 and June 2016 who had a minimum 12 months ' follow-up. The pre- and post-operative side-to-side difference in knee laxity was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer. Secondary outcomes were the pre- and post-operative IKDC , Lysholm and Tegner functional scores. Sixty-one patients were included: 49 men ( 80 %) and 12 women ( 20 %). The average age was 31.6 ± 13.7 years. The average follow-up was 19.3 ± 6.3 months. The average side-to-side difference in laxity went from 6.5 mm ( min 3; max 12) preoperatively to -0.1 mm postoperatively ( min -5 , max 4) ( p < 0.01). The average IKDC went from 39.7 ± 12 preoperatively to 94.1 ± 11.2 postoperatively ( p < 0.005) , the average Lysholm score went from 41 ± 12.9 to 95.5 ± 9.8 ( p < 0.005) , and the average Tegner score went from 6.3 ± 1.5 to 4.3 ± 1.4 ( p < 0.005). Patients were able to return to sports an average of 6.1 months after surgery. In terms of complications , 4.9 % of patients developed a cyclops lesion<symptom> and required surgical revision. This study found very good reduction in postoperative laxity after a minimum 12 months ' follow-up when ACL reconstruction is performed with the TLS IV , prospective cohort study.
