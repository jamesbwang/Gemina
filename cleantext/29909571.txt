  The marine ecosystem has been known to be a rich source of novel enzymes. Agarase is a key enzyme that can hydrolyze agar in the marine environment. Marine bacterial agarase has been isolated from various sources , such as sediments , coastal water , and deep sea and from the surface of crustaceans and seaweeds. This review presents an account of the agarase production of marine bacteria. General information about agar , agarase , isolation , and purification of marine bacterial agarases; the biochemical properties of native agarase from marine bacteria; the biochemical properties of recombinant marine bacterial agarases from engineered microorganisms; and the industrial future of marine bacterial agarases is analyzed. With recent biotechnological processes , researchers need novel functional enzymes like agarase from marine resources , such as marine bacteria , that can be used for diverse applications in the biotechnological industry. Marine bacterial agarases might be of significant interest to the industry because they are safe and are a natural source. This review highlights the potential of marine bacteria as important sources of agarase for application in various industries.
