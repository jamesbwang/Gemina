  Intussusception is a rare cause for postoperative intestinal obstruction. We report a case of intussusception in the early postoperative period following resection of proximal jejunum<symptom> and end to end anastomosis. Computed tomography showed jejunal intussusception , which was confirmed on exploration. The anastomotic site was acting as the lead point , which was resected after reduction and reanastomosed in a single layer. The patient had uneventful recovery. Very few similar cases are reported in the literature and all the reported cases are following free jejunal transfer for pharyngo-oesophageal reconstruction.
