  Given the complexity of the sterilization process , and the risk involved in absence of strict adherence to the protocol described by the medical device manufacturers , terminally sterilized devices are emerging and being promoted in the field of medical practices. The characteristics associated with conventional reprocessing are demanding logistics , costs of delay , operations and adverse events , and unacceptable liability. Demanding logistics were a result of decoupled staff between the operating room and sterilize processing department , understaffed and high-volume processing with an additional burden due to inventory management and inefficient training. Other costs arose from upkeep , delay in operating room , and surgical-site infections. Liability arose from the repeatedly use of an unquantifiable process thus adding uncertainties , limited shelf life of the reprocessed implants , contingency of flash sterilization and introduction of newer technology with higher demand on cleaning performances. In contrast , terminally sterilized single-use devices do not carry any of the aforementioned-characteristics , deeming it to be the simplest solution to the current conundrum. This review serves to provide an evaluation of logistics , costs , and potential adverse effects , both directly and indirectly , associated with current practices in the sterile processing department , and also describes as to how the use of terminally sterilized devices can help circumvent those.
