  Although homocysteine ( Hcy) , a part of the epigenome , contributes to cell death by pyroptosis and decreases peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ( PPARγ) levels , the mechanisms are unclear. Hcy is found in high concentrations in the sera of obese individuals , which can elicit an immune response as well by hypermethylating CpG islands of specific gene promoters , a marker of epigenetics. Hcy has also been established to chelate divalent metal ions like Cu
