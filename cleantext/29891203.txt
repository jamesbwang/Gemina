  The survival benefit of combined radiation therapy ( RT) and androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT) compared with ADT alone for clinically lymph node-positive prostate cancer remains controversial. We identified patients with clinically node-positive , nonmetastatic prostate cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 and treated with ADT ( n = 450) or ADT-RT ( n = 198) from a national Veterans Affairs database. We compared prostate cancer-specific mortality ( PCSM) and all-cause mortality ( ACM) between treatment groups using multivariable competing-risks regression and Cox regression , respectively. An interaction term between ADT-RT and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) level ( dichotomized about the median) was included in the multivariable models. ADT-RT was associated with improved PCSM among patients with PSA levels less than the median of 26 ng/mL ( sub-distribution hazard ratio , 0.50; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.28-0.88; P = .02) but not greater than the median ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.15; 95 % CI 0.67-1.96; P = .62) ( P = .038 for interaction). ADT-RT was also associated with improved ACM among patients with PSA levels less than the median ( HR , 0.38; 95 % CI 0.25-0.57; P < .001) but not greater than the median ( HR , 0.91; 95 % CI 0.60-1.38; P = .66) ( P = .004 for interaction). Definitive treatment with ADT-RT is associated with improved PCSM and ACM among patients with clinically node-positive prostate cancer and lower baseline PSA levels. Patients with clinically node-positive disease appear to be a heterogeneous cohort , with a subset who may achieve long-term survival with combined RT and ADT.
