  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) and frontotemporal dementia ( FTD) are two devastating and lethal neurodegenerative diseases seen comorbidly in up to 15 % of patients. Despite several decades of research , no effective treatment or disease-modifying strategies have been developed. We now understand more than before about the genetics and biology behind ALS and FTD , but the genetic etiology for the majority of patients is still unknown and the phenotypic variability observed across patients , even those carrying the same mutation , is enigmatic. Additionally , susceptibility factors leading to neuronal vulnerability in specific central nervous system regions involved in disease are yet to be identified. As the inherited but dynamic epigenome acts as a cell-specific interface between the inherited fixed genome and both cell-intrinsic mechanisms and environmental input , adaptive epigenetic changes might contribute to the ALS/FTD aspects we still struggle to comprehend. This chapter summarizes our current understanding of basic epigenetic mechanisms , how they relate to ALS and FTD , and their potential as therapeutic targets. A clear understanding of the biological mechanisms driving these two currently incurable diseases is urgent-well-needed therapeutic strategies need to be developed soon. Disease-specific epigenetic changes have already been observed in patients and these might be central to this endeavor.
