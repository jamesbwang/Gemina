  Left ventricular assist devices ( LVAD) are increasingly used for the treatment of end-stage heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Right ventricular ( RV) failure after LVAD implantation is an increasingly common clinical problem , occurring in patients early after continuous flow LVAD implant. RV failure is associated with a substantial increase in post-LVAD morbidity and mortality. RV failure can be predicted using preoperative hemodynamic , clinical , and echocardiographic variables and a variety of risk prediction algorithms. However , RV failure may also develop due to unanticipated intraoperative or perioperative factors. Early recognition and treatment are critical in terms of mitigating the impact of RV failure on post-LVAD outcomes.
