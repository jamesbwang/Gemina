  Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC) patients can not benefit from EGFR-targeted therapy even though the EGFR is highly expressed , because patients exhibit resistance to these drugs. Unfortunately , the molecular mechanisms remain relatively unknown. ANXA2 , highly expressed in invasive breast cancer cells , is closely related with poor prognosis , and acts as a molecular switch to EGFR activation. In this study , MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF7 cells were used. Our results showed that ANXA2 expression is inversely correlated with cell sensitivity to gefitinib. Knockdown of ANXA2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells increased the gefitinib induced cell death. When ANXA2 was overexpressed in MCF7 cells , the gefitinib induced cell death was decreased. Furthermore , we demonstrated that phosphorylation of ANXA2 at Tyr23 is negatively correlated with the sensitivity of TNBC to gefitinib. Altogether , our results suggest a new role of ANXA2 in regulating sensitivity of TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib.
