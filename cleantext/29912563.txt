  Aceclofenac is a popular analgesic , antipyretic , and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID) used for prolonged treatment ( at least three months) in musculoskeletal disorders. It is characterized by several limitations such as poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability. The main side-effect of aceclofenac , as well as all NSAIDs , is the gastrotoxicity; among other adverse effects , there is the risk of bleeding since aceclofenac reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation. With the aim to reduce these drawbacks , we have designed , synthesized , and characterized , both in vitro and in vivo , an orally administrable pro-drug of aceclofenac ( ACEgal). ACEgal was obtained by conjugating carboxyl group with the 6-OH group of d-galactose; its structure was confirmed by X-ray powder diffractometry. The pro-drug was shown to be stable at 37 Â°C in simulated gastric fluid ( SGF-without pepsin , pH = 1.2) and moderately stable in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS , pH = 7.4). However , it hydrolyzed in human serum with a half-life ( t
