  I am sure that all of us have been to conferences where , sitting in the audience , the person next to or in front of you reaches up with his or her phone or other device and snaps a photo of whatever is on the screen. Or perhaps you are the one doing just that. I understand the reasons for this; we want to remember the information being presented and/or we want to take that nugget of information back to our colleagues at work. But is this an appropriate thing to do?
