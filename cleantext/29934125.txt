  To investigate the influence of different materials for monolithic full posterior crowns using 3D-Finite Element Analysis ( FEA). Twelve ( 12) 3D models of adhesively-restored teeth with different crowns according to the material and its elastic modulus were analysed: Acrylic resin , Polyetheretherketone , Composite resin , Hybrid ceramic , pressable and machinable Zirconia reinforced lithium silicate , Feldspathic , Lithium disilicate , Gold alloy , Cobalt-Chromium alloy ( Co-Cr) , Zirconia tetragonal partially stabilized with yttria , and Alumina. All materials were assumed to behave elastically throughout the entire deformation. Results in restoration and cementing line were obtained using maximum principal stress. In addition , maximum shear stress criteria was used for the cementing line. Restorative materials with higher elastic modulus present higher stress concentration inside the crown , mainly tensile stress on an intaglio surface. On the other hand , materials with lower elastic modulus allow stress passage for cement , increasing shear stress on this layer. Stiffer materials promote higher stress peak values. Materials with higher elastic modulus such as Co-Cr , zirconia and alumina enable higher tensile stress concentration on the crown intaglio surface and higher shear stress on the cement layer , facilitating crown debonding.
