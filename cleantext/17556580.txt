  Coherence , signifying concurrent electron-vibrational dynamics in complex natural and man-made systems , is currently a subject of intense study. Understanding this phenomenon is important when designing carrier transport in optoelectronic materials. Here , excited state dynamics simulations reveal a ubiquitous pattern in the evolution of photoexcitations for a broad range of molecular systems. Symmetries of the wavefunctions define a specific form of the non-adiabatic coupling that drives quantum transitions between excited states , leading to a collective asymmetric vibrational excitation coupled to the electronic system. This promotes periodic oscillatory evolution of the wavefunctions , preserving specific phase and amplitude relations across the ensemble of trajectories. The simple model proposed here explains the appearance of coherent exciton-vibrational dynamics due to non-adiabatic transitions , which is universal across multiple molecular systems. The observed relationships between electronic wavefunctions and the resulting functionalities allows us to understand , and potentially manipulate , excited state dynamics and energy transfer in molecular materials.
