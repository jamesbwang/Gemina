  The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of electro-acupuncture ( EA) stimulation on remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia ( RIPH) and the possible involvement of spinal microglia suppression. A model of RIPH was established using adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by administration of remifentanil at 0.08 mg/kg intravenously for 60 min. The Huantiao and Yanglingquan acupoints were stimulated continuously by EA ( 2 Hz , ~ 1 mA) for 90 min from before paw incision to the end of remifentanil administration. Sham acupoints were stimulated by EA in the sham group. Paw withdrawal threshold ( PWT) and paw thermal withdrawal latency ( PWL) were determined. Cluster of differentiation ( CD) 11b , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α , interleukin ( IL) -1 β and IL-6 levels in spinal cord samples were measured using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. PWT and PWL values were decreased following the administration of remifentanill; however , following EA , PWT and PWL values increased compared with the sham group ( P < 0.05) , indicating that EA alleviates remifentanil-induced RIPH. CD11b , TNF-α , IL-1β and IL-6 levels were increased following remifentanil administration and these effects were counteracted by EA ( all P < 0.05). In the sham group , no significant differences were observed in PWT and PWL values or CD11b , TNF-α , IL-1β and IL-6 levels compared with the control group , suggesting that EA was responsible for the reduction in CD11b and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression following remifentanil administration. The results of the present study demonstrated that EA at the Huantiao and Yanglingquan acupoints may reduce remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia , likely by inhibiting spinal microglia via reduction of CD11b and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. However , these results are preliminary and require further validation.
