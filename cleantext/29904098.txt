  Pathogens of past and current infections have been identified directly by means of PCR or indirectly by measuring a specific immune response ( e.g. , antibody titration). Using a novel approach , Emerson and colleagues showed that the cytomegalovirus serostatus can also be accurately determined by using a T cell receptor repertoire data mining approach. In this study , we have sequenced the CD4
