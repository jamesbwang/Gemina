  Schwannomas are benign encapsulated neurogenic tumors , arising from Schwann cells embedded in neurilemal sheath as multinucleated syncytial network. Head and neck schwannomas account for 25 % -45 % of all schwannomas , majority developing in parapharyngeal space. Laryngeal schwannoma in itself is a rarity , and a glottic origin further complicates its diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge , this is the second case of glottic schwannoma being reported in medical literature. Symptomatology is attributable to mass effect of a slow-growing laryngeal tumor , ranging from sore<symptom> throat<symptom> to stridor. The gold standard method for their excision is still debatable. For small tumors , endoscopic or direct laryngoscopic approach is preferred , but for large glottic tumors , external approach is advocated for better exposure and facilitating mucosal grafting. Index case is being presented not only for its rare site of origin , but also to stress on the importance of meticulous histopathological examination to advocate appropriate treatment.
