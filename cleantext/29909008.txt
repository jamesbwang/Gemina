  Pulsed electromagnetic fields ( PEMFs) are effective in healing fractures and improving osteoporosis. However , their effect on mesenchymal cells remains largely unknown. In this study , the effects of PEMF on osteoblastogenesis and its underlying molecular signaling mechanisms were systematically investigated in C3H10T1/2 cells. C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells were exposed to 30-Hz PEMF bursts at various intensities for 3 consecutive days. The optimal PEMF exposure ( 30 Hz , 1 mT , 2 h/day) was applied in subsequent experiments. Our results suggest that intracellular ( Ca
