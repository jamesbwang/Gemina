  This pilot study was conducted to test the hypothesis that WaveLight A retrospective analysis was conducted in 35 consecutive hyperopic/hyperopic astigmatism eyes of 22 patients treated via LASIK on the Wavelight Average hyperopia treated was +2 diopters ( D) ( range +0.50 D to +7.25 D) , with the average amount of astigmatism treated +1.05 D ( range -0.25 D to -2.25 D). The average difference between the Contoura-measured and manifest magnitude of astigmatism was 0.674 D and the average axis difference was 5.65 Â°. No eyes lost corrected distance visual acuity ( CDVA) , 22.8 % of eyes gained CDVA. At 3 months , 18 ( 54 %) eyes had regressed or not achieved their targeted goal , and the average spherical equivalent ( SE) from the targeted goal was 0.973 D. Following primary procedure , 10 of these eyes had myopic SE , six had hyperopic SE , and two had SE of 0. Prior to surgery , 19 of 24 distance eyes were able to achieve 20/20 vision , and if secondary corrections are included 100 % achieved 20/20 or better post-operative , and eight ( 42 %) achieved 20/15 or better at 3 months post-operative. No eyes lost CDVA. This pilot study demonstrated that more uniform corneas<symptom> can be created while treating hyperopic corrections , but a high level of secondary corrections were needed.
