  Maternally derived amino acids ( AA) are essential for early conceptus development , and specific transporters enhance histotrophic AA content during early ruminant pregnancy. In the present study we investigated AA transporter expression in early equine conceptuses and endometrium , during normal pregnancy and after induction of embryo-uterus asynchrony. ` Normal ' conceptuses and endometrium were recovered on Days 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 after ovulation. To investigate asynchrony , Day 8 embryos were transferred to recipient mares on Day 8 or Day 3 , and conceptuses were recovered 6 or 11 days later. Endometrial expression of AA transporters solute carrier family 38 member 2 ( SLC38A2) , solute carrier family 1 members 4 and 5 ( SLC1A4 and SLC1A5) increased during early pregnancy , whereas solute carrier family 7 member 8 ( SLC7A8) , solute carrier family 43 member 2 ( SLC43A2) and solute carrier family 7 member 1 ( SLC7A1) SLC7A8 , SLC43A2 and SLC7A1 expression decreased and the expression of solute carrier family 1 member 1 ( SLC1A1) and solute carrier family 7 member 2 ( SLC7A2) was unaffected. In conceptus membranes<symptom> , most transporters studied were upregulated , either after Day 14 ( solute carrier family 7 member 5- SLC7A5 , SLC38A2 , SLC1A4 , SLC1A5 and SLC7A1) or Day 21 ( SLC43A2 and SLC7A2). Asynchronous ET indicated that endometrial SLC1A5 , SLC1A1 and SLC7A8 are primarily regulated by conceptus factors and/or longer exposure to progesterone. In conclusion , AA transporters are expressed in early equine conceptus membranes<symptom> and endometrium in specific spatiotemporal patterns. Because conceptuses express a wider range of transporters than the endometrium , we speculate that the equine yolk sac has recruited AA transporters to ensure adequate nutrient provision during an unusually long preimplantation period.
