  This study evaluated the effectiveness of Bedtime Fading with Response Cost ( BFRC) in decreasing sleep disturbances in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD) using parents as change agents by implementing treatment in the home environment. A non-concurrent multiple baseline design across three participants was used. Results indicate that BFRC was effective in eliminating unwanted co-sleeping , frequent night awakenings , and dependent sleep onset. Secondary improvements include reducing sleep onset latency , bedtime resistance , and disruptive sleep-related behaviors. Follow-up data demonstrate gains were maintained. Parents reported high satisfaction with BFRC and sleep outcomes for their children. This study extends both the practice and science of parent-implemented behavioral interventions as treatment options for children with ASD and co-occurring sleep disturbances.
