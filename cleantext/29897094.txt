  Heat management at the nanoscale is an issue of increasing importance. In optoelectronic devices the transport and decay of plasmons contribute to the dissipation of heat. By comparison of experimental data and simulations we demonstrate that it is possible to gain quantitative information about excitation , propagation and decay of surface plasmon polaritons ( SPPs) in a thin gold stripe supported by a silicon membrane. The temperature-dependent optical transmissivity of the membrane is used to determine the temperature distribution around the metal stripe with high spatial and temporal resolution. This method is complementary to techniques where the propagation of SPPs is monitored optically , and provides additional information which is not readily accessible by other means. In particular , we demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of the membrane can also be derived from our analysis. The results presented here show the high potential of this tool for heat management studies in nanoscale devices.
