  Ingestion of sharp foreign bodies is a less frequently encountered method of selfharm. This study aims to follow up patients presenting with foreign body ( FB) ingestion requiring urgent endoscopic intervention under general anaesthetic in theatre , characterise each patient and establish whether admission or removal of the FB promotes further self-harm. Eleven adult patients , totalling 38 presentations over a 28-month period were identified. Each was followed up from an initial presentation requiring endoscopy. 9/11 ( 81.9 %) where transferred either from prison or psychiatric care with an extensive history of multimodal and usually violent self-harm. Of these 8/9 ( 88.9 %) had a formal psychiatric diagnosis linked to their previous self-harm. Objects retrieved included pens , razor blades , cutlery , wiring , batteries , a metal screw and a TV aerial. The median time between presentations with self-harm was 11 days. Those discharged from the emergency department re-presented after a median of 7.5 days. This was longer , at 14 days , if admitted to hospital; with those having endoscopic procedures re-presenting after a median of 11 days. Inpatient endoscopic removal of the FB was not associated with an earlier presentation with further self-harm when compared with discharge straight form A+E , but was frequently repeated , often in a characterised manner.
