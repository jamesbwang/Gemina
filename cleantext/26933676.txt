  The land surface controls the partitioning of water and energy fluxes and therefore plays a crucial role in the climate system. The coupling between soil moisture and air temperature , in particular , has been shown to affect the severity and occurrence of temperature extremes and heat waves. Here we study soil moisture-temperature coupling in five land surface models , focusing on the terrestrial segment of the coupling in the warm season. All models are run off-line over a common period with identical atmospheric forcing data , in order to allow differences in the results to be attributed to the models ' partitioning of energy and water fluxes. Coupling is calculated according to two semiempirical metrics , and results are compared to observational flux tower data. Results show that the locations of the global hot spots of soil moisture-temperature coupling are similar across all models and for both metrics. In agreement with previous studies , these areas are located in transitional climate regimes. The magnitude and local patterns of model coupling , however , can vary considerably. Model coupling fields are compared to tower data , bearing in mind the limitations in the geographical distribution of flux towers and the differences in representative area of models and in situ data. Nevertheless , model coupling correlates in space with the tower-based results ( r = 0.5-0.7) , with the multimodel mean performing similarly to the best-performing model. Intermodel differences are also found in the evaporative fractions and may relate to errors in model parameterizations and ancillary data of soil and vegetation characteristics.
