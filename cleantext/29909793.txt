  The experiment reported in this Research Communication aimed to determine the combined effects of early weaning and post-weaning feeding level on growth , reproductive parameters and milk yield in Alpine goats. Sixty-four Alpine goat kids were weaned abruptly at either 12 · 2 ( ± 1 · 40) kg ( 40 d of age , E) or 17 · 7 ( ± 2 · 30) kg ( 60 d of age , No). After weaning , E and No goats were subjected to 2 feeding strategies ( n = 16): ad libitum concentrate until 130 d of age and then 620 g DM/d/goat until 200 d of age ( EC and NoC) or ad libitum concentrate until 200 d of age ( EAL and NoAL). Goats were weighed twice a month until 200 d of age. Pregnancy rate and litter size were recorded. Daily milk yield was measured by milk meter during the first lactation. Up to 60 d of age , average daily gain ( ADG) of E kids was significantly lower than No kids. From 60 to 130 d of age , ADG of the four treatments were not different. After 130 d of age , EC and NoC kids had lower ADG than EAL and NoAL kids. Pregnancy rates of EAL and NoAL goats were lower than those of EC and NoC. Milk yield was not modified by weaning weight or feeding management. Milk quality was not affected by any treatment. To conclude , the age at weaning as well as the feeding level after weaning did not negatively impact growth and milk yield. We hypothesise that the establishment of the lactation function is not impacted by rearing management. Hence , decreasing the age at weaning could be an interesting way to reduce the cost of the rearing period in goat kids.
