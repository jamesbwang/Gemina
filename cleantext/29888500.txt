  Traditionally , peppers ( Capsicum annuum L.) of Jaranda variety used for the production of smoked paprika are harvested manually in the north of Extremadura ( Spain). Mechanical harvesting is necessary to improve the profitability of this crop. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of plant density ( D1 = 36765 and D2 = 73530 plants ha The increase in plant density increased marketable yield per hectare , although the yield per plant decreased. With mechanical harvesting , the optimal density was D2 ( 15151 kg ha The cultural practices tested provided an adequate productivity of fresh pepper and a better quality of the final product. According to the results of the present study , the increase in plant density and the substitution of manual harvesting by mechanical harvesting could be profitable practices with respect to the Jaranda variety of pepper used for the manufacture of smoked paprika. These practices maintain the main quality parameters of dried peppers and paprika. Â© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.
