  A natural generalization of the classical deflection function , the functional dependence of the deflection angle on the angular momentum ( or the impact parameter) , is the joint probability density function of these two quantities , revealing the correlation between them. It provides , at a glance , detailed information about the reaction mechanisms and how changes in the impact parameter affect the product angular distribution. It is also useful to predict the presence of quantum phenomena such as interference. However , the classical angular momentum-scattering angle correlation function has a limited use whenever quantum effects become important. Rigorously speaking , there is not a quantum equivalent of the classical joint distribution , as the differential cross section depends on the coherences between the different values of
