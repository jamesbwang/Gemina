  The Internet is a common tool for gay , bisexual , and other men who have sex with men ( MSM) to find sexual partners and sexual health information. Given persistently high human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infection rates among MSM , it is important to examine the role of online outreach for MSM as part of HIV<pathogen> prevention and care. We provide an overview of the unique perspectives of online sexual health outreach , delivered through AIDS Service Organizations ( ASOs) through sociosexual Internet sites and mobile applications. Data were drawn from the qualitative arm of the community-based Cruising Counts study conducted across Ontario from December 2013 to January 2014. ASO online outreach providers and managers ( n = 22) were recruited to complete a 1-h in-person/telephone interview to explore in-depth their experiences with , and perspectives on , delivering online outreach services for MSM in Ontario. Thematic analyses were conducted inductively using NVivo 10. Service providers suggested a high demand for online outreach services for MSM. Strengths and advantages of online outreach over face-to-face outreach included anonymity , instant access to services , peer model , and accessing hard-to-reach populations of MSM. Barriers included consistent quality of service , collaborations between companies that own online technologies and outreach service agencies , budgetary and staff capacity issues , and uncertainty of best practices and evaluation parameters for online outreach. Findings from these interviews can inform service providers , policy makers , and researchers on how online sexual health outreach can play a greater role in HIV<pathogen> prevention by better acknowledging and addressing the opportunities and barriers experienced by service providers working with MSM communities online.
