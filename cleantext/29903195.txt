  To evaluate the independent and joint effects of FADS1 polymorphism and fish oil intake on oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC). A case-control study was conducted with 259 newly diagnosed primary OSCC patients and538 controls frequency-matched by sex and age in Fujian from September 2010 to September 2014. Data on demographics and dietary habits such as marine fish oil intake were collected using a structure questionnaire. FADS1 rs174549 genotype was determined using Taq Man genotyping assays. Unconditional logistic regression was used to the oddsratios ( ORs) and their 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) of FADS1 polymorphism and fish oil intake for OSCC. FADS1 rs174549 AA genotype was associated with decreased risk of OSCC ( codominant model: OR = 0. 53 , 95 % CI 0. 33-0. 85; recessive model: OR = 0. 57 , 95 % CI 0. 38-0. 87). Compared with those who non-intake marine fish oil , regularly intake of marine fish oil decreased the risk of OSCC ( OR = 0. 54 , 95 % CI: 0. 32-0. 91). Moreover , a multiplicative interaction between FADS1 rs174549 polymorphism and marine fish oil intake for oral cancer ( OR _ ( multiplicative) = 0. 31 , 95 % CI0. 11-0. 87). FADS1 rs174549 polymorphism and marine fish oil intake may be independent protective factors for OSCC with a gene-diet multiplicative interaction.
