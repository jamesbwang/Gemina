  In this work , we have compared photosynthetic characteristics of photosystem II ( PSII) in Tradescantia leaves of two contrasting ecotypes grown under the low light ( LL) and high light ( HL) regimes during their entire growth period. Plants of the same genus , T. fluminensis ( shade-tolerant) and T. sillamontana ( sun-resistant) , were cultivated at 50-125 Âµmol photons m
