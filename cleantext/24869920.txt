  Capacity fade in lithium-ion battery electrodes can result from a degradation mechanism in which the carbon black-binder network detaches from the active material. Here we present two approaches to visualize and quantify this detachment and use the experimental results to develop and validate a model that considers how the active particle size , the viscoelastic parameters of the composite electrode , the adhesion between the active particle and the carbon black-binder domain , and the solid electrolyte interphase growth rate impact detachment and capacity fade. Using carbon-silicon composite electrodes as a model system , we demonstrate X-ray nano-tomography and backscatter scanning electron microscopy with sufficient resolution and contrast to segment the pore space , active particles , and carbon black-binder domain and quantify delamination as a function of cycle number. The validated model is further used to discuss how detachment and capacity fade in high-capacity materials can be minimized through materials engineering.
