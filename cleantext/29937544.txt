  Surgery combined with new adjuvant chemotherapy is the primary treatment for early stage invasive and advanced stage breast cancer. Growing evidence indicates that patients with ERα-positive breast cancer show poor<symptom> response<symptom> to chemotherapeutics. However , ERα-mediated drug-resistant mechanisms remain unclear. Levels of WW domain-binding protein 2 ( WBP2) and drug-resistant gene were determined by western blotting and RT-PCR , respectively. Cell viability was measured by preforming MTT assay. CD243 expression and apoptosis rate were evaluated by flow cytometry. Interactions of WBP2/ERα and ERα/MDR1 were detected by co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) assay , respectively. There was an intrinsic link between WBP2 and ERα in drug-resistant cancer cells. Upregulation of WBP2 in MCF7 cells increased the chemoresistance to doxorubicin , while RNAi-mediated knockdown of WBP2 in MCF7/ADR cells sensitised the cancer cells to doxorubicin. Further investigation in in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that WBP2 expression was directly correlated with MDR1 , and WBP2 could directly modulate MDR1 transcription through binding to ERα , resulting in increased chemotherapy drug resistance. Our finding provides a new mechanism for the chemotherapy response of ERα-positive breast tumours , and WBP2 might be a key molecule for developing new therapeutic strategies to treat chemoresistance in breast cancer patients.
