  The Bethe-Salpeter equation ( BSE) formalism has been recently shown to be a valuable alternative to time-dependent density functional theory ( TD-DFT) with the same computing time scaling with system size. In particular , problematic transitions for TD-DFT such as charge-transfer , Rydberg and cyanine-like excitations were shown to be accurately described with BSE. We demonstrate here that combining the BSE formalism with the polarisable continuum model ( PCM) allows us to include simultaneously linear-response and state-specific contributions to solvatochromism. This is confirmed by exploring transitions of various natures ( local , charge-transfer ,
