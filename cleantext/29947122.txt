  As the population of patients with a Fontan palliation grows so does , the number of patients with cardiac failure necessitating orthotopic heart transplant ( OHT) and combined heart-liver transplant ( CHLT). There is recent evidence that current era cardiac transplant in Fontan patients has improved outcomes , but most studies have a preponderance of pediatrics patients in their cohorts. We examine our institutional experience with adult OHT and CHLT transplantation for failed Fontan physiology. Retrospective analysis of patients at the Ahmanson/UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Disease Center who underwent OHT or CHLT for failing Fontan physiology from January 1 , 2002 to May 31 , 2017. We identified 20 patients with single-ventricle physiology and Fontan palliation who underwent OHT or CHLT. The median age was 29.5 years ( range 19-44). Five patients underwent CHLT because of biopsy proven hepatic cirrhosis. The median length of hospital stay was 23 days ( range 8-76) post-OHT and 51 days ( range 26-77) post-CHLT. During a median follow-up of 56 months ( range 2-178) , there was one mortality occurring at 34 months post-OHT due to coronary vasculopathy. Most frequent early postoperative complications included bleeding and infection ( 55 % and 20 % , respectively) and surgical reintervention for bleeding complications ( n = 8 , 40 %). One CHLT patient experienced clinically significant hepatic rejection requiring admission and steroid treatment. Despite inherent risks and complexities of OHT or CHLT in patients with a failed Fontan , transplant is a reasonable therapy. Peri- and postoperative complications are common and may require surgical reintervention. Continued observation of practices and unifying themes may help improve patient selection , pre- and postoperative treatment and ultimately outcomes.
