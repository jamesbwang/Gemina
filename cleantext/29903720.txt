  To investigate whether umbilical cord milking ( UCM) at birth improves systemic blood flow and short-term outcomes , as compared with immediate cord clamping ( ICC). Randomised clinical trial. Single tertiary care centre. Infants born to eligible women presenting in preterm labour between 24 and 31 weeks ' gestation. UCM three times at birth or ICC. Primary outcome included systemic blood flow as represented by echo-derived superior vena cava ( SVC) flow at 4-6 hours after birth. The echocardiographer and interpreter were blinded to the randomisation. Secondary outcomes included cardiac output , neonatal morbidities and mortality. Analysis was by intention to treat. A total of 73 infants were randomised ( 37 to UCM and 36 to ICC). Mean ( SD) gestational age was 27 ( 2) weeks and mean ( SD) birth weight was 1040 ( 283) g. Haemoglobin on admission was higher in the UCM than in the ICC group ( 16.1 vs 15.0 g/L) , p = 0.049 ( mean difference 1.1 , 95 % CI 0.003 to 2.2). No statistically significant differences were found between groups in SVC flow at 4-6 hours ( 88.9 ± 37.8 and 107.3 ± 60.1 mL/kg/min) , p = 0.13 ( mean difference -18.4 , 95 % CI -41.7 to 5.0 mL/kg/min) or at 10-12 hours of age ( 102.5 ± 41.8 and 90.6 ± 28.4 mL/kg/min) , p = 0.17 ( mean difference 12.0 , 95 % CI -4.7 to 28.7 mL/kg/min) , cardiac output or neonatal morbidities. Cord milking was not shown to improve functional cardiac outcomes , neonatal morbidity or mortality. More research is needed before routine cord milking can be recommended for very preterm infants.
