  The loss of appropriate cell adhesion normally induces apoptosis via a process termed anoikis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) in the cancer microenvironment on the anoikis resistance and pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma ( OS) cells , and to evaluate the critical role of the interleukin ( IL) -8/ C-X-C chemokine receptor ( CXCR) 1/Akt-signaling pathway in these processes. Metastatic OS subtype cells , which did or did not interact with MSC-conditioned medium ( MSC-CM) in vitro , were isolated from the pulmonary site and named Saos2-lung-M. Both MSC-CM and IL-8 treatment increased the anoikis resistance of Saos2 cells in vitro. Moreover , exogenous MSC-CM promoted the survival and metastasis of Saos2 cells in nude mice. Saos2-lung-M cells were more malignant and resistant to anoikis than parental cells. MSCs secreted IL-8 , thereby protecting OS cells from anoikis. Blocking the IL-8/ CXCR1/Akt pathway via CXCR1 knockdown inhibited the pulmonary metastasis of Saos2-lung-MSCs and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion , MSCs enhanced OS cell resistance to anoikis and pulmonary metastasis via regulation of the IL-8/ CXCR1/Akt pathway. These findings suggest that MSCs can `` select for '' OS cells with high metastatic potential in vivo , and highlight CXCR1 as a key target in the regulation of pulmonary metastasis of OS cells.
