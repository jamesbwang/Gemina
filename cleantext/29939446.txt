  Few studies report on experience of care for Parkinson 's disease ( PD) from patients ' own point of view. Analysis of a survey in 11 European countries on self-reported access to services and satisfaction with different aspects of care. 1,775 people with PD ( PwP) participated with disease duration ranging from < 1 to 42 years. Initial referral to specialists had taken < 3 months in most but medication reviews occurred every 3 months in only 10 % , every 6 months in 37 % , once a year in 40 % , and every two years or less frequently in 13 %. Waiting times to therapists were usually at â‰¥ 4 months. Satisfaction with care was highest for involvement of PwP in decisions ( 63 % of respondents satisfied) and involvement of family/carer ( 62 %) followed by communication with PwP ( 57 %) , information received ( 54 %) , frequency of treatment reviews ( 52 %) , suitability of treatment for the individual condition and circumstances ( 52 %) , but lowest for availability and accessibility of treatment when needed ( 48 %) and collaborations between healthcare professionals in delivering care ( 41 % satisfied). The main factors associated with overall satisfaction scores with care were the overall satisfaction with initial consultation ( r = 0.26 , p < 0.0001) , the sensitivity with which the diagnosis was communicated , the quantity of information provided ( both r = 0.24 , p < 0.0001) and the frequency of medication review ( r = 0.17 , p < 0.0001). More coordinated and responsive care , tailored to the individual , with regular and timely medication reviews and treatment referrals , is likely to improve satisfaction with care in current health care pathways.
