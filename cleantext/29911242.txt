  Stability is the key property of functional materials. In this work we investigate computationally the degradative potential of a model Mn-BTC ( BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) metal-organic framework ( MOF) building block in aqueous solutions under oxidative conditions. Model density functional theory calculations have shown that the direct hydrolysis of the Mn-containing moieties is more difficult than their decomposition via oxidation-induced paths. While the interaction with H2O2 species is of non-covalent nature and requires O-O-bond breaking to initiate Mn-center oxidation , open-shell O2 species readily oxidize radical Mn-centers and form bonds of σ- , π- , or δ-symmetry with the metal. The oxidative transformations of di-Mn paddle-wheel carboxylate structure-forming units are accompanied with substantial distortions of the coordination polyhedra that , together with the increased Lewis acidity of the oxidized metal centers , facilitates the hydrolysis leading to the degradation of the structure at a larger scale. Whereas such a mechanism is expected to hamper the catalytic applications of such Mn-MOFs , the associated structural response to oxidizing and radical species can create a basis for the construction of Mn-MOF-based drug delivery systems with increased bio-compatibility.
