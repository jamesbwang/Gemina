  Functional deficiency of A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs ( ADAMTS) 13 causally assists in the pathology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP). Previous study showed that the WXXW motif is very important to the enzymatic activity of ADAMTS13. However , the functional role for a single amino acid residue within WXXW motif is still undetermined. Here , Trp
